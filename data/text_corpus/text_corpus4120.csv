performance keywords floating oscillating water column hydrodynamic performance primary efficiency assessment dual chamber owc 1 introduction climate change due to fossil fuel pollution population energy demand and power crises requires exploring and harvesting renewable energy resources khan et al 2017 ocean wave energy is an indigenous resource in many regions and countries worldwide and is among the renewables with the greatest potential aderinto and li 2018 bahaj 2011 falcão 2010 guedes soares et al 2012 several european countries in particular have good levels of wave energy resources guedes soares et al 2014 wave energy is one of the promising resources of ocean renewables as it contains higher energy density compared to other renewable energy resources e g wind and solar this inestimable potential motivated many researchers to focus exploring methods to harvest this valuable resource of clean energy these attempts led to the invention of over one thousand wave energy converter wec patents mustapa et al 2017 however amongst the various types of wecs invented so far only a limited number around two hundred reached the stage of model testing mustapa et al 2017 and only few successfully reached the demonstration or commercial phase one of the main barriers against the development of wec devices is their poor efficiency on harvesting the wave energy the reason may be due to the particular nature of the waves as the water particles have circular motions while they propagate hence harnessing the kinetic energy of them becomes a challenging process compared to the other resources of energy wind energy hydropower nuclear and fossil fuel power plants with those resources the conventional turbines which have optimized performance are normally implemented to capture the energy from the fluid with the uniformly distributed streamlines several measures as well as concepts are proposed so far to improve the performance of wec devices leading to reduce the energy production costs which finally depend on the existing wave resources and the features of the wave converters silva et al 2013 and other logistic aspects castro santos et al 2018 oscillating water column owc devices are one of the most developed wec concepts falcão 2015 as their maintenance is easy and no moving parts are installed in the water also they can be utilized as fixed coastal or floating structures to absorb energy of the waves in this context rezanejad et al 2013 carried out numerical investigations to explore the influence of adding a step next to the coastal owc devices they proved that the efficiency of the device can be improved significantly by choosing a proper geometrical design of the step to explore this idea several studies have been carried out both numerically deng et al 2019b medina lópez et al 2017 2019 ning et al 2019a rezanejad et al 2019a and experimentally rezanejad and guedes soares 2018b in general the efficiency showed to improve by adding a step or making changes in the bottom morphology near to the owc this phenomenon can be explained as an extra resonance mechanism that is added to the system causing a better energy absorption see rezanejad and guedes soares 2018b for a detailed discussion this effect may also be imposed to floating owc concepts by adding a bottom plate underneath the device that extends outside of the device deng et al 2019a rezanejad and guedes soares 2014 2015 rezanejad et al 2019b the application of dual chambers in coastal owc devices was introduced by rezanejad et al 2015 and can also present several advantages compared to single chamber owcs they used the numerical method to analyse the hydrodynamic performance of those devices and found out that the efficiency of the device can be improved in a broad range of wave periods compared to single chamber conventional owcs extensive research studies were performed maturing the proposed idea by implementing numerical elhanafi et al 2018 ning et al 2017a 2018 wang et al 2019 or experimental ning et al 2019b 2019c approaches they proved that the hydrodynamic performance of these devices was improved by employing the proposed solution in principle the mutual interactions between the chambers as well as different resonance frequencies of each chamber can lead to improve the efficiency covering a broad range of energetic sea states rezanejad et al 2015 wang and zhang 2021 performed an analytical study on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a dual chamber owc device system with a gap between each unit they found out that the gap length can effectively contribute to the formation of multiple peak efficiency values at the short wave regimes wang et al 2021 introduced the concept of a dual chamber owc device with a pitching front lip wall and demonstrated its superiority in wave power extraction the hydrodynamic performance of a multi owc platform was investigated by zheng et al 2020a in their study each owc chamber is enclosed by two partially submerged vertical walls similar to the dual chamber owc concept it is explored that a smaller draft front wall and a larger draft back wall to be beneficial for broadening the range of high efficiency performance of the platform the efficiency of owc devices may also be improved by applying proper modifications in the geometrical characteristics of the chamber in this regard malara and arena 2013 and malara et al 2017b evaluated the hydrodynamic performance of an owc with the u shaped chamber they conclude that the device reaches a resonant condition even with incident random waves maximizing the efficiency arena and filianoti 2007 malara et al 2017a 2017b deng et al 2020 introduced the application of surging front walls attached to the coastal owc devices which may increase the pneumatic efficiency of wave energy extraction all the indicated measures can reduce the energy production costs as they might have influence on the performance improvement of owc devices it is noteworthy to remark that incorporation of wec devices with other type of marine structures may also reduce the energy production costs as some portion of the construction as well as maintenance expenses would be shared with those applications in this context some research studies were focused on the application of owc devices combined with the shore protection infrastructures or being used as floating breakwaters he et al 2017 2019 ning et al 2017b thiruvenkatasamy and neelamani 1997 zhang and ning 2019 zheng et al 2020c hybrid energy production units which utilize different type of marine renewable energy devices e g wind turbines solar panels other types of wecs etc with owc devices also were studied in previous research works as the energy production costs can be reduced significantly michele et al 2019 perez collazo et al 2018a 2018b sarmiento et al 2019 zheng et al 2020b a particular type of floating owc device with relatively high hydrodynamic performance is the backward bent duct buoy bbdb that was invented by masuda et al 1987 koo and lee 2011 presented a time varying pneumatic pressure to model a backward bent duct buoy as a wave energy converter in the time domain using a potential numerical wave tank nwt lee et al 2013 have simulated a bbdb in the time domain using fully nonlinear potential nwt the pneumatic pressure in the chamber of the device was modelled based on time varying air pressure formulation sheng 2019a implemented boundary element method based on potential flow theory to estimate the basic hydrodynamic parameters for the floating bbdb owc device and the water body in the water column in the bbdb owc device power performance of bbdb systems is analysed accordingly by sheng 2019b chen et al 2017 performed an experimental study to investigate the influence of wave characteristics orifice area mooring chain length and mooring point position on the hydrodynamic performance of a bbdb model a novel dual chamber floating owc device is introduced in this research work which has an improved hydrodynamic performance in a wide range of wave frequencies furthermore the device can also be implemented as a floating breakwater unit which can further reduce the energy production costs the inspiration of this concept came from the previous research works concentrating mainly on improving the performance of owc devices in section 2 of this paper the concept is briefly explained and its main features are highlighted the experimental set up as well as the theory used to evaluate the performance of the device is described in sections 3 and 4 and the obtained results regarding the performance of the system are presented in section 5 2 floating dual chamber owc device the schematic plan of the new wec device is depicted in fig 1 this new device is composed by a combination of two chambers that operate similarly to floating oscillating water column fowc devices rezanejad and guedes soares 2018a 2019 the fore chamber is faced up directly to the incident waves the mechanism of power absorption of this part is analogous to conventional owc devices hence it will be recalled hereafter as owc part the owc part is supported by the underneath plate which is extended outside of the unit this plate has an effect to increase the absorbed power similar to adding a step next to the coastal owc breakwaters deng et al 2019a rezanejad et al 2013 2019a rezanejad and guedes soares 2018b the second chamber is employed in the rear part of the fowc device which has indirect interactions with the propagating waves the chamber has the duct shaped configuration similar to the backward bend duct buoy bbdb devices therefore this part will be recalled hereafter as bbdb part of the device analogous to the conventional bbdb devices this part is also interacting with waves in downstream of the device each of the bbdb and owc parts of this new concept has their own dedicated turbines to capture the energy of the waves in a specific range of wave frequencies the reason for considering two dedicated air turbines is that each of the chambers has a specific resonance frequency that requires specific power take off pto damping to be imposed to harness the maximum power from the waves as was briefly described in the previous section for the shoreline dual chamber owc devices it is also expected in the case of floating dual chamber concept that the mutual interactions between the chambers could boost the tendency of the system to capture more energy two buoyancy modulus deployed in the fore and rear part of the device providing the required floatation with the desired draft the vacant space inside these modules can also be implemented to store the produced energy by using hydrogen in this case the need for transmitting the energy in terms of electricity using under water cables would be eliminated which can further reduce the energy production costs of the units installed in offshore zones the produced energy in the form of hydrogen can also be used to support the energy demand of the marine vehicles which currently have an important role in increasing the environmental pollution corbett et al 1999 it is worth remarking that the introduced concept can also be implemented as a combined system to simultaneously produce energy and protect the shorelines from the harsh waves in other words it can also act as an efficient floating breakwater system as it absorbs a significant portion of the energy in addition to reflecting a part of the energy emitted to the device and do not permit the waves to pass toward the downstream of the device hence it can provide an appropriate sheltered area in the downstream of the device the energy production costs will therefore be reduced as construction and maintenance expenses are shared with the shore protection application 3 experimental set up the physical model study was carried out at the wave basin of the university of porto with 28 m long 12 m wide and 1 2 m deep wave conditions were generated by a multi element piston type wave generation system controlled by an hr wallingford wave synthesiser software and equipped with a dynamic wave absorption system a dissipative beach was installed at the opposite end of the wave basin to minimize reflection of the incident waves a geometrical scale of 1 50 was selected in accordance with the dimensions of the experimental facility the quality of experimental results i e minimization of scale effects as well as operational and economic criteria the water depth is chosen to be equal to 80 cm the physical model was constructed and operated in accordance with the froude similitude criterion the model was built using the plexiglas material due to its transparent characteristics that makes it possible to visually observe the motions of the fluid inside the geometrical dimensions of the model are shown in fig 2 a and the picture of the physical model tested in the wave flume is represented in fig 2 b the overall weight of the model including the ballast weights as well as the sensors installed inside the chambers is around 80 0 kg two ballast weights made from the dense rubber plates are fixed inside the fore and rear buoyancy modules to provide the required draft for the floating device the weight of the fore and rear ballasts are equal to 1 67 and 3 30 kg respectively which were designed in such a way that the model floats in the upright position with the draft equal to 31 cm in the calm water and having zero inclinations in the both lateral directions the overall length as well as the width of the model is equal to 124 0 and 100 0 cm respectively the mooring system consists of eight chains two hawsers and two floating buoys which are symmetrically arranged see fig 3 the model is connected to two floating buoys with the elastic strings polyester hawser each of the floating buoys is supported by four catenary type mooring chains to restrict their motions the azimuth angles of these chains are 0 45 90 and 180 respectively the nominal diameter of the mooring chain is 4 mm the total length of each mooring chain is 6 5 m with mooring radius setting as 6 m the weight per unit length of chain in air is 5 3 kg m the length of the polyester hawser is 0 5 m its nominal diameter and weight per unit length in air is 3 mm and 6 5 g m respectively the fairlead position the place where the polyester hawser is attached to the model is demonstrated in fig 2 a reproduction of the power take off pto mechanisms in physical models is not a straightforward task since the technologies suitable for full scale devices usually do not lend themselves to down scaling payne et al 2008 in this study the influence of the pto unit is applied by employing a hole on the cap of the two chambers in this case a pressure drop proportional to the square value of the air volume flux passing through the hole is induced this influence is relatively equivalent to the effect of the impulse turbines on the air flow passing through them the application of impulse turbines as the pto units of owcs have become popular recently as their efficiency is higher and their size is smaller compared to the other pto concepts e g wells turbines falcão et al 2016 henriques et al 2017 hence it was decided to apply the pto effect by employing a hole three holes with various diameters were applied to induce high corresponding to the smallest hole low corresponding to the biggest hole and medium corresponding to the hole with the intermediate size damping conditions on each chamber the corresponding hole diameters for the owc part is 4 2 6 7 and 9 7 cm inducing high medium and low damping conditions respectively the corresponding hole sizes for the bbdb part is designed equal to 5 9 9 3 and 13 2 cm it should be remarked that only one hole has remained open in each test for each of the chambers while the other holes are sealed in order to apply the proper value of the pto damping to the system see fig 2 b in this research work the corresponding results for the following five damping conditions are represented high owc high bbdb damping condition corresponds to applying smallest hole to the both owc and bbdb chambers medium owc high bbdb low owc high bbdb medium owc medium bbdb and low owc low bbdb damping conditions the experimental equipment used consisted of eight resistive wave gauges to measure the water free surface elevation in the wave flume two capacitance type wave probes and two air pressure sensors to measure the surface elevation and the air pressure in the two chambers respectively the corresponding position of the resistive wave gauges in the wave flume is represented in fig 3 b the picture of the wave tank with the model and the wave gauges already installed is also shown in fig 3 c the sampling frequency of 20 hz was used for recording the data obtained from the capacitance type wave probes as well as the air pressure sensors for the resistive wave gauges the sampling frequency of 40 hz in the physical model was selected to avoid aliasing in data spectral analysis and to provide a satisfactory accuracy to the parameters estimated based on time domain analysis as data statistics are relatively sensitive to finite sampling rates selected wave conditions were calibrated before the beginning of the tests without the moored floating owc both the regular and irregular wave conditions are investigated in the experimental study two wave heights equal to h 4 and 8 cm were applied in the regular wave tests the following twelve wave periods were studied when the regular waves with the height equal to 4 cm is generated t 0 8 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 2 0 and 2 2 s in the case of producing the regular waves with the height equal to 8 cm only six wave periods are considered t 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 and 2 2 s the duration of the regular wave tests is chosen in such a way that around 100 complete wave cycles are generated by the wave paddles tests were carried out with irregular long crested waves characterized by a jonswap spectrum peak enhancement factor of 3 3 the following peak periods were selected t p 1 2 1 4 1 6 and 1 8 s with the significant wave height equal to h s 4 cm the corresponding time for running the random wave tests is designed in such a way that the generated wave record includes approximately 500 individual cycles of wave an individual cycle of wave is defined as the portion of a record between two successive zero up or down crossings the characteristics of the generated sea states are also checked by performing spectral analysis of the data gathered from the wave probes to ensure that the desired wave condition is generated with the sufficient accuracy an example of the measured data from the air pressure sensors p 1 and p 2 as well as the capacitance type wave probes ζ 1 and ζ 2 installed in the fore and rear chambers is shown in fig 4 for the regular wave case with t 1 7 s and h 4 cm the subscript 1 used hereafter in all the parameters corresponds to the fore chamber owc part and the subscript 2 is associated to the rear chamber bbdb part as can be seen in fig 4 the amplitudes of the air pressure as well as the surface elevation values inside the two chambers become constant few seconds after initiation of the test proving that the stable condition is reached in the corresponding regular wave test it is worth to note that the capacitance type wave probes have been fixed to the body of the device hence they basically measure the vertical free surface elevations with respect to the body of the floating device which should be distinguished from the absolute motions of the internal free surfaces however the relative surface elevation in the vertical direction is the substantial parameter that causes the air inside the chambers to be compressed decomposed which leads to capturing the energy of waves therefore ζ 1 and ζ 2 parameters will be used later in the next section to estimate the pneumatic power generated by the device 4 hydrodynamic performance assessment the mean captured pneumatic power by the two components chambers of the floating wec device can be estimated simply by integrating the rate of work done by pressure forces with respect to time the instantaneous rate of the work p 1 or p 2 in owc or bbdb parts respectively can be evaluated by multiplying the instantaneous air pressure p 1 or p 2 to the air volume flux q 1 or q 2 passed through the pto units holes in the cap of the device in this study for each of the chambers 1 p i p i q i i 1 2 corresponding to the owc or bbdb part respectively the air pressure p i is directly measured by the pressure sensors installed in the chambers of the floating wec device the water surface elevation data measured by the capacitance wave probes inside the chambers are used to estimate the instantaneous air volume flux in this regard the air volume flux charged or discharged into the chambers through the holes is supposed to be equal to the volume flux swept by the inside water planes those two magnitudes of volume fluxes are considered to be equal as the volume of air confined inside the two chambers is small hence the air compressibility phenomenon or humidity of the air has negligible effects on the calculated air volume flux falcão and henriques 2014 2019 medina lopez et al 2019 sheng et al 2014b therefore the instantaneous air volume flux can be expressed as 2 q i l i b d i 3 ζ i j i 1 2 where l i and b are the length and the width of the internal water plane inside the chambers and d i 3 ζ i j is the third order approximation to the time derivative of the free surface elevation which can be evaluated as 3 d i 3 ζ i j 11 ζ i j 18 ζ i j 1 9 ζ i j 2 2 ζ i j 3 6 δ t i 1 2 where δ t 0 05 s is the time step between two consecutive data points it should be noted that the free surface elevation ζ i j inside the chamber i at the time t j is calculated from the measurements obtained from the capacitance wave probes inside the owc and bbdb parts therefore it is assumed that the internal water surface inside the two chambers remains approximately like a horizontal plane piston sloshing phenomenon is ignored hence the instantaneous air volume flux can be estimated through the application of equation 2 the sloshing frequencies occur approximately at values of the dimensionless wavenumber k b n π where parameters k b and n are the wave number lateral width of the tank and sloshing mode number respectively in closed tanks evans and porter 1995 similarly it is expected that the first and second modes of sloshing phenomenon occur approximately at the wave periods t 1 14 and 0 80 s corresponding to the wave numbers k π and 2 π respectively as the lateral width of the floating model is equal to 1 0 m these two wave periods occur within the range of the studied wave periods in this research work and the higher modes of sloshing happen beyond of this range the wave period corresponding to the first mode of sloshing does not coincide with the wave periods considered in the experimental plan and no sloshing phenomenon is visually observed during undertaking the tests at proximity periods t 1 1 and 1 2 s accordingly however the second mode of the sloshing takes place at t 0 8 s which matches with the first smallest wave period used in the tests in this study the sloshing phenomenon is also detected visually at this period in the owc chamber of the floating device however as will be shown later the hydrodynamic performance of the system is quite small about 3 at this period which reveals the indicated period is not of great importance from the practical point of view moreover it is also visually observed that the internal free surfaces in two chambers move upward and downward approximately similar to a horizontal plane of piston in the rest of the employed wave periods therefore it can be concluded that the application of equation 2 which is developed based on assuming horizontal plane for the internal water surfaces remains valid for the implemented wave periods in this study in this context an example of the calculated instantaneous power in those two parts p 1 and p 2 as well as the overall instantaneous power captured by the whole floating wec device p p p 1 p 2 is depicted in fig 5 for the regular waves with t 1 7 s and h 4 cm when the high owc high bbdb damping condition is applied to the system it can be seen from this figure that the share of the bbdb part becomes dominant in terms of absorbing energy compared to the owc part therefore the average pneumatic power p i absorbed from the waves can be estimated as 4 p i 1 t m a x 0 t m a x p i d t 1 t m a x 0 t m a x p i q i d t i 1 2 where t m a x is the duration of the measurements the overall mean pneumatic power p absorbed by the floating wec is the sum of the mean powers captured by the two chambers 5 p p 1 p 2 the hydrodynamic performance primary efficiency η i is defined as the ratio of the mean absorbed power p i to the mean incident wave energy flux p i n c 6 η i p i p i n c i 1 2 the primary efficiency parameter represents the capability of the chamber i to convert the energy of the incoming waves to the pneumatic power thus the overall hydrodynamic performance primary efficiency η of the floating wec device would be the sum of the primary efficiencies of the two chambers 7 η η 1 η 2 the mean of the incident wave energy flux can be evaluated using the incident wave spectrum s ω falcão and rodrigues 2002 8 p i n c b ρ g 0 s ω c g ω d ω where b is the width of the internal water plane equal to the crest width of a portion of the incident wave propagated toward the device ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration ω is the wave angular frequency and c g is the group velocity which can be estimated as follows 9 c g 1 2 ω k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where h is the water depth and k is the wave number and can be related to the wave angular frequency ω by implementing the dispersion relation 10 ω 2 g k tanh k h the incident wave spectrum was estimated based on the development of the least squares method proposed by mansard and funke 1980 that uses simultaneous records of the free surface elevations measured by the first three aligned wave gauges installed between the wec device and the wave paddles wave gauges 1 2 and 3 in fig 3 b wave gauge no 4 is also placed between the model and the wave paddles to be used as an alternative option in the cases of happening any abnormalities in the recorded data by the main wave gauges approximately 20 s of the initial signal were discarded from the analysis this is the time that takes the wave to generate and propagate and permits that the system reaches a quasi steady state condition this guarantees a stable signal that makes easier the spectral analysis 5 results and discussion the hydrodynamic performance of owc devices is typically improved in the wave periods close to the natural period of the system the natural period t n of the conventional owc devices can be evaluated approximately using the following simplified mathematical expression evans and porter 1995 sheng et al 2014a 11 t n 2 π a g where a is the average length of the chamber of the owc device that the water column has reciprocity motions inside this formula has been derived by implementing simplified hydrostatic equilibrium equations therefore it only provides a rough approximation regarding the natural period of the system as some prominent parameters e g the influence of the added mass are already ignored the novel wec device introduced in this research study includes two chambers hence at least two resonance periods are expected to occur that may cause improvements in the performance of the device in the corresponding nearby periods rezanejad and guedes soares 2019 the approximate length that the water column has oscillatory motions inside the owc and bbdb parts of the device is equal to 49 5 and 76 5 cm respectively therefore the approximate values corresponding to the natural periods of the owc and bbdb parts would be equal to t n 1 41 and 1 75 s respectively which is estimated by substituting those two lengths into equation 11 the variation of the primary efficiency of the floating wec device with respect to the wave period for the case of regular waves or peak period for the case of random waves is shown in figures 6 8 11 for various pto damping conditions the hydrodynamic performance of the each chamber of the device η 1 and η 2 for the owc and bbdb parts as well as the overall efficiency of the device η are shown on those figures to investigate the role of the two chambers in capturing the energy fig 6 represents the corresponding results associated with the high owc high bbdb condition for the two regular wave heights h 4 and 8 cm as well as one significant height h s 4 cm as can be seen in fig 6 c the overall hydrodynamic performance η is higher than around 40 percentage in a wide range of wave periods varying between 1 2 and 1 9 s for the regular waves with h 4 and 8 cm in other words the primary efficiency of the device is over 40 in a wave period range that varies between 8 5 and 13 5 s in prototype scale geometric scale of the device is 1 50 these wave periods cover most of the energetic sea states in the portuguese islands the location that the device is initially designed to be exploited rusu et al 2008 rusu and guedes soares 2012 furthermore the abovementioned improved performance is obtained by applying a constant and probably not even optimized damping condition in real applications as it would be possible to apply proper controlling tools to the pto system even higher performance is expected to occur the overall performance curve has two consecutive peaks at t 1 2 and 1 5 s which prevents the efficiency curve to drop in the periods between those values as well as the adjacent periods this feature imposes an appropriate condition that the efficiency of the device is maintained at high levels for instance it becomes higher than around 60 in a relatively wide range of periods it is also observed in fig 6 c that the hydrodynamic performance of the device reached approximately the unit value in the regular waves with t 1 5 s and h 4 cm in other words the device could be able to harness all the energy of the incident wave propagated toward it which is another beneficial aspect of the device that rarely detected in other floating wec devices in this context babarit 2015 performed a comprehensive research study to provide a database of capture width ratio hydrodynamic efficiency of various well known technologies of wecs the hydrodynamic performance of fixed and floating owc systems including conventional bbdb devices is reported to have the value in the range between 7 and 41 which is obtained mainly from model tests the case studies of the owc devices have the average efficiency of 29 with the standard deviation equal to 13 which reveals the superiority of the introduced device in this study compared to those technologies in terms of reaching higher levels of the hydrodynamic performance as can be seen in fig 6 c the hydrodynamic performance of the device is reached approximately the unit value at the period equal to t 1 5 s that means the system could be able to absorb the wave power equivalent to the whole wave energy flux distributed along the lateral width of the device crest width on the other hand damping phenomenon wave radiated damping and damping due to the viscous effects is one of the reasons that prevent floating wecs to capture the whole energy of waves it is because of the reason that radiated waves due to the motions of the floating device and or vicious effects may dissipate some portion of energy hence it seems that the device absorbs some portion of the energy from the waves passed next to the wec device it should be noted that as the regular wave period t 1 5 s was not applied in the tests performed with the height h 8 cm the performance of the device in this condition is not unfortunately estimated however the high value of the hydrodynamic performance is expected to occur in this case at the period t 1 5 s similar to the h 4 cm case it is because the efficiency of the system at t 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 s for the wave height h 4 cm is around 0 44 0 99 and 0 74 respectively on the other hand the hydrodynamic performance at the periods t 1 4 and 1 6 s in the h 8 cm case has the values around 0 57 and 0 64 respectively which is relatively close to the corresponding values of the efficiency in the h 4 cm case consequently it seems that the system may probably keep its tendency to reach high levels of the efficiency may be relatively close to the unit value at the period t 1 5 s in the case h 8 cm as well in addition the efficiency of the device in regular waves with h 8 cm becomes higher than the corresponding cases with h 4 cm at some wave periods e g t 1 2 1 4 2 and 2 2 s this is in contrast with the initial expectation that the performance should be mitigated by increasing the wave height as the viscous effects are growing however this is probably due to this reason that the value of the pto damping imposed to the system is increased and get closer to the optimum value by increasing the wave height in this case increasing the wave height causes to enhance the air volume flux through the hole as well as the corresponding reynolds number which induces higher pto damping condition although the diameter of the hole remains fixed as was mentioned earlier the primary efficiency curve of the device in regular waves with h 4 cm has two peaks occurring at t 1 2 and 1 5 s see fig 6 when the high owc high bbdb damping condition is applied to the system the period of the first peak t 1 2 s is relatively close to the natural period of the owc part of the system t n 1 41 s calculated from equation 11 the difference between the values of the peak periods in fig 6 c t 1 2 and 1 5 s and the ones predicted from equation 11 t n 1 41 and 1 75 s can be attributed to the a complex interaction of the two water column masses confined within the chambers of the system that interact together through the radiation phenomenon b influence of the floating device motions and c simplifications applied to develop the indicated mathematical formula stated by equation 11 in this context as it was mathematically proved by rezanejad and guedes soares 2018b the peak periods of the efficiency curve in the wec systems that are constituted from two oscillatory masses like the floating device in this study do not occur necessarily at the independent natural periods of the oscillatory masses consequently a certain difference between the natural frequency of the water columns in owc and bbdb parts with the peak periods of the efficiency curve in fig 6 c is observed it can be deduced that the owc chamber has the main role in absorbing the energy in the proximity periods of t 1 2 s as a the primary efficiency of the owc part η 1 is slightly higher than bbdb part η 2 in fig 6 and b the natural period of the owc part of the system t n 1 41 s calculated from equation 11 is relatively close to the first peak period t 1 2 s however the efficiency of the bbdb part also keeps maintaining the improved performance in this range as well this reveals that probably the mutual interaction between the chambers as it was stated earlier in sections 1 and 2 may induce constructive effects in terms of improving the efficiency even in the chamber in this case bbdb part with the different natural period from the period of the incident wave likewise the similar phenomenon occurs for the second peak t 1 5 s which is relatively close to the natural period of the bbdb part of the system t n 1 75 s in this context the variation of the response amplitude operator rao of the motions of the device in three degrees of freedom surge heave and pitch for the high owc high bbdb damping condition is illustrated in fig 7 the detailed descriptions about the tool and procedure used for measuring the motions of the system are already reported in the recent research study by gadelho et al 2021 and here only the high owc high bbdb damping case is addressed to explore the relative correlation between the motions of the device and its efficiency see gadelho et al 2021 for further discussions regarding the motion characteristics of the system in other damping cases as can be detected in fig 7 the motions of the system in small wave periods close to t 1 2 s are relatively small which allows the owc part similar to the fixed owc systems to harvest the energy of waves effectively on the other hand by increasing the wave period close to t 1 5 s the amplitude of the motions of the device increases enabling the bbdb part to capture the energy of waves more effectively it is noteworthy to remark that the pitch motion plays a dominant role in conventional bbdb devices to capture energy of waves rezanejad and guedes soares 2015 toyota et al 2009 likewise the high amplitude of the pitch motion together with the surge motion which is basically coupled with the pitch causes the higher tendency of the bbdb part to harvest the energy of waves compared to the owc part which can also be recognized by comparing the efficiency of the bbdb and owc parts in fig 6 a and b in large wave periods the heave motion amplitude has the tendency to approach the unit value in higher periods as in long wavelength the system acts relatively similar to a floating particle which follows the free source motions the performance of the floating wec device looks promising in random waves which has the average value over 40 in the entire range of the peak periods studied in this investigation however the performance of the device is suppressed specifically in the lower periods compared to the regular waves as can be seen in fig 6 this is because the random nature of the generated sea states that include various components of waves hence some of the wave components occur with the period less than 1 2 s at which the efficiency of the device is quite reduced thus it influences a certain reduction in the efficiency of the device in random waves the pto damping imposed to the owc part of the device is reduced by increasing the size of the hole in the cap of this part while the damping of the bbdb part maintained fixed as before i e medium owc high bbdb and low owc high bbdb damping conditions and the corresponding results are shown in figs 7 and 8 as can be realized from those figures the performance of the device is specifically reduced in the lower range of wave periods in which the role of the owc part to capture the energy is eliminated the efficiency also reduced in higher wave periods that are close to the natural period of the bbdb part which shows the prominent influence of the mutual interactions between the two chambers to absorb the energy in a wide range of wave periods in other words the radiation effect due to the air pressure inside the owc chamber is suppressed due to reducing the pto damping in figs 8 and 9 therefore the influence of the owc chamber on the bbdb chamber through the air radiation effects is mitigated accordingly on the other hand the efficiency of the bbdb part η 2 is also suppressed at the period t 1 5 s that corresponds to the natural frequency of the bbdb chamber although the pto damping of the owc is reduced it means that loosing pto damping in one chamber and corresponding air radiation effects indirectly affects the efficiency of the other one consequently it can be deduced that the mutual interaction of two chambers through the air radiation effects can cause an increase in the power absorption capacity of the two chambers the influence of the medium owc medium bbdb and low owc low bbdb damping conditions are also investigated and shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the efficiency of the device is drastically reduced by increasing the size of the holes the pto damping values are reduced in these cases the air pressure in the two chambers has quite slight alternations with the mean value close to the atmospheric pressure as the relatively big holes are used in the cap of the model hence a significant reduction occurs in the performance of the device the average efficiency of the device η for the various pto damping condition is represented in table 1 to provide a quantitative overview regarding the hydrodynamic performance of the device in this context the overall primary efficiency η of the device in the range of the periods peak periods between 1 2 and 1 8 s has been averaged this range covers the wave periods varying between 8 5 and 12 7 s in the prototype case as the scale factor is equal to 50 which includes the most energetic sea states in portuguese oceanic area as can be seen in this table promising results are obtained for the high owc high bbdb damping condition the average efficiency is over 55 in the regular waves and 41 in random waves in this broad range of wave periods although the constant damping is applied to the device reducing the pto damping causes a significant reduction in the average efficiency which reveals that the pto damping has high impact on the overall hydrodynamic performance 6 conclusions a novel concept of a floating wec device with improved hydrodynamic performance is introduced in this research study the device includes two chambers that convert the energy of the incident waves to the pneumatic power similar to owc devices a comprehensive experimental investigation is carried out to study the hydrodynamic performance of the device with different pto damping conditions in regular and irregular waves it was revealed that the device has improved hydrodynamic performance in a broad range of wave periods covering the most probable sea states in portuguese oceanic area in this case the average efficiency of the device was estimated to be over 55 and 41 in the regular and random waves respectively by applying a constant high damping condition in both chambers the hydrodynamic performance can further be improved by implementing appropriate pto controlling tools in the realistic applications it was also observed that the devised concept has the capability to convert all the energy of the incoming waves to pneumatic power in a certain wave condition which was rarely detected in other types of floating wec devices the detailed investigations are carried out to study the role of the two chambers in harnessing the energy it was found that the mutual interaction between the two chambers has a prominent impact on increasing the hydrodynamic performance of the device it is planned to undertake cfd numerical investigations in the future research activities to study the hydrodynamic performance of the devised system as well as its motion characteristics in a more

performance keywords floating oscillating water column hydrodynamic performance primary efficiency assessment dual chamber owc 1 introduction climate change due to fossil fuel pollution population energy demand and power crises requires exploring and harvesting renewable energy resources khan et al 2017 ocean wave energy is an indigenous resource in many regions and countries worldwide and is among the renewables with the greatest potential aderinto and li 2018 bahaj 2011 falcão 2010 guedes soares et al 2012 several european countries in particular have good levels of wave energy resources guedes soares et al 2014 wave energy is one of the promising resources of ocean renewables as it contains higher energy density compared to other renewable energy resources e g wind and solar this inestimable potential motivated many researchers to focus exploring methods to harvest this valuable resource of clean energy these attempts led to the invention of over one thousand wave energy converter wec patents mustapa et al 2017 however amongst the various types of wecs invented so far only a limited number around two hundred reached the stage of model testing mustapa et al 2017 and only few successfully reached the demonstration or commercial phase one of the main barriers against the development of wec devices is their poor efficiency on harvesting the wave energy the reason may be due to the particular nature of the waves as the water particles have circular motions while they propagate hence harnessing the kinetic energy of them becomes a challenging process compared to the other resources of energy wind energy hydropower nuclear and fossil fuel power plants with those resources the conventional turbines which have optimized performance are normally implemented to capture the energy from the fluid with the uniformly distributed streamlines several measures as well as concepts are proposed so far to improve the performance of wec devices leading to reduce the energy production costs which finally depend on the existing wave resources and the features of the wave converters silva et al 2013 and other logistic aspects castro santos et al 2018 oscillating water column owc devices are one of the most developed wec concepts falcão 2015 as their maintenance is easy and no moving parts are installed in the water also they can be utilized as fixed coastal or floating structures to absorb energy of the waves in this context rezanejad et al 2013 carried out numerical investigations to explore the influence of adding a step next to the coastal owc devices they proved that the efficiency of the device can be improved significantly by choosing a proper geometrical design of the step to explore this idea several studies have been carried out both numerically deng et al 2019b medina lópez et al 2017 2019 ning et al 2019a rezanejad et al 2019a and experimentally rezanejad and guedes soares 2018b in general the efficiency showed to improve by adding a step or making changes in the bottom morphology near to the owc this phenomenon can be explained as an extra resonance mechanism that is added to the system causing a better energy absorption see rezanejad and guedes soares 2018b for a detailed discussion this effect may also be imposed to floating owc concepts by adding a bottom plate underneath the device that extends outside of the device deng et al 2019a rezanejad and guedes soares 2014 2015 rezanejad et al 2019b the application of dual chambers in coastal owc devices was introduced by rezanejad et al 2015 and can also present several advantages compared to single chamber owcs they used the numerical method to analyse the hydrodynamic performance of those devices and found out that the efficiency of the device can be improved in a broad range of wave periods compared to single chamber conventional owcs extensive research studies were performed maturing the proposed idea by implementing numerical elhanafi et al 2018 ning et al 2017a 2018 wang et al 2019 or experimental ning et al 2019b 2019c approaches they proved that the hydrodynamic performance of these devices was improved by employing the proposed solution in principle the mutual interactions between the chambers as well as different resonance frequencies of each chamber can lead to improve the efficiency covering a broad range of energetic sea states rezanejad et al 2015 wang and zhang 2021 performed an analytical study on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a dual chamber owc device system with a gap between each unit they found out that the gap length can effectively contribute to the formation of multiple peak efficiency values at the short wave regimes wang et al 2021 introduced the concept of a dual chamber owc device with a pitching front lip wall and demonstrated its superiority in wave power extraction the hydrodynamic performance of a multi owc platform was investigated by zheng et al 2020a in their study each owc chamber is enclosed by two partially submerged vertical walls similar to the dual chamber owc concept it is explored that a smaller draft front wall and a larger draft back wall to be beneficial for broadening the range of high efficiency performance of the platform the efficiency of owc devices may also be improved by applying proper modifications in the geometrical characteristics of the chamber in this regard malara and arena 2013 and malara et al 2017b evaluated the hydrodynamic performance of an owc with the u shaped chamber they conclude that the device reaches a resonant condition even with incident random waves maximizing the efficiency arena and filianoti 2007 malara et al 2017a 2017b deng et al 2020 introduced the application of surging front walls attached to the coastal owc devices which may increase the pneumatic efficiency of wave energy extraction all the indicated measures can reduce the energy production costs as they might have influence on the performance improvement of owc devices it is noteworthy to remark that incorporation of wec devices with other type of marine structures may also reduce the energy production costs as some portion of the construction as well as maintenance expenses would be shared with those applications in this context some research studies were focused on the application of owc devices combined with the shore protection infrastructures or being used as floating breakwaters he et al 2017 2019 ning et al 2017b thiruvenkatasamy and neelamani 1997 zhang and ning 2019 zheng et al 2020c hybrid energy production units which utilize different type of marine renewable energy devices e g wind turbines solar panels other types of wecs etc with owc devices also were studied in previous research works as the energy production costs can be reduced significantly michele et al 2019 perez collazo et al 2018a 2018b sarmiento et al 2019 zheng et al 2020b a particular type of floating owc device with relatively high hydrodynamic performance is the backward bent duct buoy bbdb that was invented by masuda et al 1987 koo and lee 2011 presented a time varying pneumatic pressure to model a backward bent duct buoy as a wave energy converter in the time domain using a potential numerical wave tank nwt lee et al 2013 have simulated a bbdb in the time domain using fully nonlinear potential nwt the pneumatic pressure in the chamber of the device was modelled based on time varying air pressure formulation sheng 2019a implemented boundary element method based on potential flow theory to estimate the basic hydrodynamic parameters for the floating bbdb owc device and the water body in the water column in the bbdb owc device power performance of bbdb systems is analysed accordingly by sheng 2019b chen et al 2017 performed an experimental study to investigate the influence of wave characteristics orifice area mooring chain length and mooring point position on the hydrodynamic performance of a bbdb model a novel dual chamber floating owc device is introduced in this research work which has an improved hydrodynamic performance in a wide range of wave frequencies furthermore the device can also be implemented as a floating breakwater unit which can further reduce the energy production costs the inspiration of this concept came from the previous research works concentrating mainly on improving the performance of owc devices in section 2 of this paper the concept is briefly explained and its main features are highlighted the experimental set up as well as the theory used to evaluate the performance of the device is described in sections 3 and 4 and the obtained results regarding the performance of the system are presented in section 5 2 floating dual chamber owc device the schematic plan of the new wec device is depicted in fig 1 this new device is composed by a combination of two chambers that operate similarly to floating oscillating water column fowc devices rezanejad and guedes soares 2018a 2019 the fore chamber is faced up directly to the incident waves the mechanism of power absorption of this part is analogous to conventional owc devices hence it will be recalled hereafter as owc part the owc part is supported by the underneath plate which is extended outside of the unit this plate has an effect to increase the absorbed power similar to adding a step next to the coastal owc breakwaters deng et al 2019a rezanejad et al 2013 2019a rezanejad and guedes soares 2018b the second chamber is employed in the rear part of the fowc device which has indirect interactions with the propagating waves the chamber has the duct shaped configuration similar to the backward bend duct buoy bbdb devices therefore this part will be recalled hereafter as bbdb part of the device analogous to the conventional bbdb devices this part is also interacting with waves in downstream of the device each of the bbdb and owc parts of this new concept has their own dedicated turbines to capture the energy of the waves in a specific range of wave frequencies the reason for considering two dedicated air turbines is that each of the chambers has a specific resonance frequency that requires specific power take off pto damping to be imposed to harness the maximum power from the waves as was briefly described in the previous section for the shoreline dual chamber owc devices it is also expected in the case of floating dual chamber concept that the mutual interactions between the chambers could boost the tendency of the system to capture more energy two buoyancy modulus deployed in the fore and rear part of the device providing the required floatation with the desired draft the vacant space inside these modules can also be implemented to store the produced energy by using hydrogen in this case the need for transmitting the energy in terms of electricity using under water cables would be eliminated which can further reduce the energy production costs of the units installed in offshore zones the produced energy in the form of hydrogen can also be used to support the energy demand of the marine vehicles which currently have an important role in increasing the environmental pollution corbett et al 1999 it is worth remarking that the introduced concept can also be implemented as a combined system to simultaneously produce energy and protect the shorelines from the harsh waves in other words it can also act as an efficient floating breakwater system as it absorbs a significant portion of the energy in addition to reflecting a part of the energy emitted to the device and do not permit the waves to pass toward the downstream of the device hence it can provide an appropriate sheltered area in the downstream of the device the energy production costs will therefore be reduced as construction and maintenance expenses are shared with the shore protection application 3 experimental set up the physical model study was carried out at the wave basin of the university of porto with 28 m long 12 m wide and 1 2 m deep wave conditions were generated by a multi element piston type wave generation system controlled by an hr wallingford wave synthesiser software and equipped with a dynamic wave absorption system a dissipative beach was installed at the opposite end of the wave basin to minimize reflection of the incident waves a geometrical scale of 1 50 was selected in accordance with the dimensions of the experimental facility the quality of experimental results i e minimization of scale effects as well as operational and economic criteria the water depth is chosen to be equal to 80 cm the physical model was constructed and operated in accordance with the froude similitude criterion the model was built using the plexiglas material due to its transparent characteristics that makes it possible to visually observe the motions of the fluid inside the geometrical dimensions of the model are shown in fig 2 a and the picture of the physical model tested in the wave flume is represented in fig 2 b the overall weight of the model including the ballast weights as well as the sensors installed inside the chambers is around 80 0 kg two ballast weights made from the dense rubber plates are fixed inside the fore and rear buoyancy modules to provide the required draft for the floating device the weight of the fore and rear ballasts are equal to 1 67 and 3 30 kg respectively which were designed in such a way that the model floats in the upright position with the draft equal to 31 cm in the calm water and having zero inclinations in the both lateral directions the overall length as well as the width of the model is equal to 124 0 and 100 0 cm respectively the mooring system consists of eight chains two hawsers and two floating buoys which are symmetrically arranged see fig 3 the model is connected to two floating buoys with the elastic strings polyester hawser each of the floating buoys is supported by four catenary type mooring chains to restrict their motions the azimuth angles of these chains are 0 45 90 and 180 respectively the nominal diameter of the mooring chain is 4 mm the total length of each mooring chain is 6 5 m with mooring radius setting as 6 m the weight per unit length of chain in air is 5 3 kg m the length of the polyester hawser is 0 5 m its nominal diameter and weight per unit length in air is 3 mm and 6 5 g m respectively the fairlead position the place where the polyester hawser is attached to the model is demonstrated in fig 2 a reproduction of the power take off pto mechanisms in physical models is not a straightforward task since the technologies suitable for full scale devices usually do not lend themselves to down scaling payne et al 2008 in this study the influence of the pto unit is applied by employing a hole on the cap of the two chambers in this case a pressure drop proportional to the square value of the air volume flux passing through the hole is induced this influence is relatively equivalent to the effect of the impulse turbines on the air flow passing through them the application of impulse turbines as the pto units of owcs have become popular recently as their efficiency is higher and their size is smaller compared to the other pto concepts e g wells turbines falcão et al 2016 henriques et al 2017 hence it was decided to apply the pto effect by employing a hole three holes with various diameters were applied to induce high corresponding to the smallest hole low corresponding to the biggest hole and medium corresponding to the hole with the intermediate size damping conditions on each chamber the corresponding hole diameters for the owc part is 4 2 6 7 and 9 7 cm inducing high medium and low damping conditions respectively the corresponding hole sizes for the bbdb part is designed equal to 5 9 9 3 and 13 2 cm it should be remarked that only one hole has remained open in each test for each of the chambers while the other holes are sealed in order to apply the proper value of the pto damping to the system see fig 2 b in this research work the corresponding results for the following five damping conditions are represented high owc high bbdb damping condition corresponds to applying smallest hole to the both owc and bbdb chambers medium owc high bbdb low owc high bbdb medium owc medium bbdb and low owc low bbdb damping conditions the experimental equipment used consisted of eight resistive wave gauges to measure the water free surface elevation in the wave flume two capacitance type wave probes and two air pressure sensors to measure the surface elevation and the air pressure in the two chambers respectively the corresponding position of the resistive wave gauges in the wave flume is represented in fig 3 b the picture of the wave tank with the model and the wave gauges already installed is also shown in fig 3 c the sampling frequency of 20 hz was used for recording the data obtained from the capacitance type wave probes as well as the air pressure sensors for the resistive wave gauges the sampling frequency of 40 hz in the physical model was selected to avoid aliasing in data spectral analysis and to provide a satisfactory accuracy to the parameters estimated based on time domain analysis as data statistics are relatively sensitive to finite sampling rates selected wave conditions were calibrated before the beginning of the tests without the moored floating owc both the regular and irregular wave conditions are investigated in the experimental study two wave heights equal to h 4 and 8 cm were applied in the regular wave tests the following twelve wave periods were studied when the regular waves with the height equal to 4 cm is generated t 0 8 1 0 1 1 1 2 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 1 7 1 8 2 0 and 2 2 s in the case of producing the regular waves with the height equal to 8 cm only six wave periods are considered t 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 and 2 2 s the duration of the regular wave tests is chosen in such a way that around 100 complete wave cycles are generated by the wave paddles tests were carried out with irregular long crested waves characterized by a jonswap spectrum peak enhancement factor of 3 3 the following peak periods were selected t p 1 2 1 4 1 6 and 1 8 s with the significant wave height equal to h s 4 cm the corresponding time for running the random wave tests is designed in such a way that the generated wave record includes approximately 500 individual cycles of wave an individual cycle of wave is defined as the portion of a record between two successive zero up or down crossings the characteristics of the generated sea states are also checked by performing spectral analysis of the data gathered from the wave probes to ensure that the desired wave condition is generated with the sufficient accuracy an example of the measured data from the air pressure sensors p 1 and p 2 as well as the capacitance type wave probes ζ 1 and ζ 2 installed in the fore and rear chambers is shown in fig 4 for the regular wave case with t 1 7 s and h 4 cm the subscript 1 used hereafter in all the parameters corresponds to the fore chamber owc part and the subscript 2 is associated to the rear chamber bbdb part as can be seen in fig 4 the amplitudes of the air pressure as well as the surface elevation values inside the two chambers become constant few seconds after initiation of the test proving that the stable condition is reached in the corresponding regular wave test it is worth to note that the capacitance type wave probes have been fixed to the body of the device hence they basically measure the vertical free surface elevations with respect to the body of the floating device which should be distinguished from the absolute motions of the internal free surfaces however the relative surface elevation in the vertical direction is the substantial parameter that causes the air inside the chambers to be compressed decomposed which leads to capturing the energy of waves therefore ζ 1 and ζ 2 parameters will be used later in the next section to estimate the pneumatic power generated by the device 4 hydrodynamic performance assessment the mean captured pneumatic power by the two components chambers of the floating wec device can be estimated simply by integrating the rate of work done by pressure forces with respect to time the instantaneous rate of the work p 1 or p 2 in owc or bbdb parts respectively can be evaluated by multiplying the instantaneous air pressure p 1 or p 2 to the air volume flux q 1 or q 2 passed through the pto units holes in the cap of the device in this study for each of the chambers 1 p i p i q i i 1 2 corresponding to the owc or bbdb part respectively the air pressure p i is directly measured by the pressure sensors installed in the chambers of the floating wec device the water surface elevation data measured by the capacitance wave probes inside the chambers are used to estimate the instantaneous air volume flux in this regard the air volume flux charged or discharged into the chambers through the holes is supposed to be equal to the volume flux swept by the inside water planes those two magnitudes of volume fluxes are considered to be equal as the volume of air confined inside the two chambers is small hence the air compressibility phenomenon or humidity of the air has negligible effects on the calculated air volume flux falcão and henriques 2014 2019 medina lopez et al 2019 sheng et al 2014b therefore the instantaneous air volume flux can be expressed as 2 q i l i b d i 3 ζ i j i 1 2 where l i and b are the length and the width of the internal water plane inside the chambers and d i 3 ζ i j is the third order approximation to the time derivative of the free surface elevation which can be evaluated as 3 d i 3 ζ i j 11 ζ i j 18 ζ i j 1 9 ζ i j 2 2 ζ i j 3 6 δ t i 1 2 where δ t 0 05 s is the time step between two consecutive data points it should be noted that the free surface elevation ζ i j inside the chamber i at the time t j is calculated from the measurements obtained from the capacitance wave probes inside the owc and bbdb parts therefore it is assumed that the internal water surface inside the two chambers remains approximately like a horizontal plane piston sloshing phenomenon is ignored hence the instantaneous air volume flux can be estimated through the application of equation 2 the sloshing frequencies occur approximately at values of the dimensionless wavenumber k b n π where parameters k b and n are the wave number lateral width of the tank and sloshing mode number respectively in closed tanks evans and porter 1995 similarly it is expected that the first and second modes of sloshing phenomenon occur approximately at the wave periods t 1 14 and 0 80 s corresponding to the wave numbers k π and 2 π respectively as the lateral width of the floating model is equal to 1 0 m these two wave periods occur within the range of the studied wave periods in this research work and the higher modes of sloshing happen beyond of this range the wave period corresponding to the first mode of sloshing does not coincide with the wave periods considered in the experimental plan and no sloshing phenomenon is visually observed during undertaking the tests at proximity periods t 1 1 and 1 2 s accordingly however the second mode of the sloshing takes place at t 0 8 s which matches with the first smallest wave period used in the tests in this study the sloshing phenomenon is also detected visually at this period in the owc chamber of the floating device however as will be shown later the hydrodynamic performance of the system is quite small about 3 at this period which reveals the indicated period is not of great importance from the practical point of view moreover it is also visually observed that the internal free surfaces in two chambers move upward and downward approximately similar to a horizontal plane of piston in the rest of the employed wave periods therefore it can be concluded that the application of equation 2 which is developed based on assuming horizontal plane for the internal water surfaces remains valid for the implemented wave periods in this study in this context an example of the calculated instantaneous power in those two parts p 1 and p 2 as well as the overall instantaneous power captured by the whole floating wec device p p p 1 p 2 is depicted in fig 5 for the regular waves with t 1 7 s and h 4 cm when the high owc high bbdb damping condition is applied to the system it can be seen from this figure that the share of the bbdb part becomes dominant in terms of absorbing energy compared to the owc part therefore the average pneumatic power p i absorbed from the waves can be estimated as 4 p i 1 t m a x 0 t m a x p i d t 1 t m a x 0 t m a x p i q i d t i 1 2 where t m a x is the duration of the measurements the overall mean pneumatic power p absorbed by the floating wec is the sum of the mean powers captured by the two chambers 5 p p 1 p 2 the hydrodynamic performance primary efficiency η i is defined as the ratio of the mean absorbed power p i to the mean incident wave energy flux p i n c 6 η i p i p i n c i 1 2 the primary efficiency parameter represents the capability of the chamber i to convert the energy of the incoming waves to the pneumatic power thus the overall hydrodynamic performance primary efficiency η of the floating wec device would be the sum of the primary efficiencies of the two chambers 7 η η 1 η 2 the mean of the incident wave energy flux can be evaluated using the incident wave spectrum s ω falcão and rodrigues 2002 8 p i n c b ρ g 0 s ω c g ω d ω where b is the width of the internal water plane equal to the crest width of a portion of the incident wave propagated toward the device ρ is the density of water g is the gravitational acceleration ω is the wave angular frequency and c g is the group velocity which can be estimated as follows 9 c g 1 2 ω k 1 2 k h sinh 2 k h where h is the water depth and k is the wave number and can be related to the wave angular frequency ω by implementing the dispersion relation 10 ω 2 g k tanh k h the incident wave spectrum was estimated based on the development of the least squares method proposed by mansard and funke 1980 that uses simultaneous records of the free surface elevations measured by the first three aligned wave gauges installed between the wec device and the wave paddles wave gauges 1 2 and 3 in fig 3 b wave gauge no 4 is also placed between the model and the wave paddles to be used as an alternative option in the cases of happening any abnormalities in the recorded data by the main wave gauges approximately 20 s of the initial signal were discarded from the analysis this is the time that takes the wave to generate and propagate and permits that the system reaches a quasi steady state condition this guarantees a stable signal that makes easier the spectral analysis 5 results and discussion the hydrodynamic performance of owc devices is typically improved in the wave periods close to the natural period of the system the natural period t n of the conventional owc devices can be evaluated approximately using the following simplified mathematical expression evans and porter 1995 sheng et al 2014a 11 t n 2 π a g where a is the average length of the chamber of the owc device that the water column has reciprocity motions inside this formula has been derived by implementing simplified hydrostatic equilibrium equations therefore it only provides a rough approximation regarding the natural period of the system as some prominent parameters e g the influence of the added mass are already ignored the novel wec device introduced in this research study includes two chambers hence at least two resonance periods are expected to occur that may cause improvements in the performance of the device in the corresponding nearby periods rezanejad and guedes soares 2019 the approximate length that the water column has oscillatory motions inside the owc and bbdb parts of the device is equal to 49 5 and 76 5 cm respectively therefore the approximate values corresponding to the natural periods of the owc and bbdb parts would be equal to t n 1 41 and 1 75 s respectively which is estimated by substituting those two lengths into equation 11 the variation of the primary efficiency of the floating wec device with respect to the wave period for the case of regular waves or peak period for the case of random waves is shown in figures 6 8 11 for various pto damping conditions the hydrodynamic performance of the each chamber of the device η 1 and η 2 for the owc and bbdb parts as well as the overall efficiency of the device η are shown on those figures to investigate the role of the two chambers in capturing the energy fig 6 represents the corresponding results associated with the high owc high bbdb condition for the two regular wave heights h 4 and 8 cm as well as one significant height h s 4 cm as can be seen in fig 6 c the overall hydrodynamic performance η is higher than around 40 percentage in a wide range of wave periods varying between 1 2 and 1 9 s for the regular waves with h 4 and 8 cm in other words the primary efficiency of the device is over 40 in a wave period range that varies between 8 5 and 13 5 s in prototype scale geometric scale of the device is 1 50 these wave periods cover most of the energetic sea states in the portuguese islands the location that the device is initially designed to be exploited rusu et al 2008 rusu and guedes soares 2012 furthermore the abovementioned improved performance is obtained by applying a constant and probably not even optimized damping condition in real applications as it would be possible to apply proper controlling tools to the pto system even higher performance is expected to occur the overall performance curve has two consecutive peaks at t 1 2 and 1 5 s which prevents the efficiency curve to drop in the periods between those values as well as the adjacent periods this feature imposes an appropriate condition that the efficiency of the device is maintained at high levels for instance it becomes higher than around 60 in a relatively wide range of periods it is also observed in fig 6 c that the hydrodynamic performance of the device reached approximately the unit value in the regular waves with t 1 5 s and h 4 cm in other words the device could be able to harness all the energy of the incident wave propagated toward it which is another beneficial aspect of the device that rarely detected in other floating wec devices in this context babarit 2015 performed a comprehensive research study to provide a database of capture width ratio hydrodynamic efficiency of various well known technologies of wecs the hydrodynamic performance of fixed and floating owc systems including conventional bbdb devices is reported to have the value in the range between 7 and 41 which is obtained mainly from model tests the case studies of the owc devices have the average efficiency of 29 with the standard deviation equal to 13 which reveals the superiority of the introduced device in this study compared to those technologies in terms of reaching higher levels of the hydrodynamic performance as can be seen in fig 6 c the hydrodynamic performance of the device is reached approximately the unit value at the period equal to t 1 5 s that means the system could be able to absorb the wave power equivalent to the whole wave energy flux distributed along the lateral width of the device crest width on the other hand damping phenomenon wave radiated damping and damping due to the viscous effects is one of the reasons that prevent floating wecs to capture the whole energy of waves it is because of the reason that radiated waves due to the motions of the floating device and or vicious effects may dissipate some portion of energy hence it seems that the device absorbs some portion of the energy from the waves passed next to the wec device it should be noted that as the regular wave period t 1 5 s was not applied in the tests performed with the height h 8 cm the performance of the device in this condition is not unfortunately estimated however the high value of the hydrodynamic performance is expected to occur in this case at the period t 1 5 s similar to the h 4 cm case it is because the efficiency of the system at t 1 4 1 5 and 1 6 s for the wave height h 4 cm is around 0 44 0 99 and 0 74 respectively on the other hand the hydrodynamic performance at the periods t 1 4 and 1 6 s in the h 8 cm case has the values around 0 57 and 0 64 respectively which is relatively close to the corresponding values of the efficiency in the h 4 cm case consequently it seems that the system may probably keep its tendency to reach high levels of the efficiency may be relatively close to the unit value at the period t 1 5 s in the case h 8 cm as well in addition the efficiency of the device in regular waves with h 8 cm becomes higher than the corresponding cases with h 4 cm at some wave periods e g t 1 2 1 4 2 and 2 2 s this is in contrast with the initial expectation that the performance should be mitigated by increasing the wave height as the viscous effects are growing however this is probably due to this reason that the value of the pto damping imposed to the system is increased and get closer to the optimum value by increasing the wave height in this case increasing the wave height causes to enhance the air volume flux through the hole as well as the corresponding reynolds number which induces higher pto damping condition although the diameter of the hole remains fixed as was mentioned earlier the primary efficiency curve of the device in regular waves with h 4 cm has two peaks occurring at t 1 2 and 1 5 s see fig 6 when the high owc high bbdb damping condition is applied to the system the period of the first peak t 1 2 s is relatively close to the natural period of the owc part of the system t n 1 41 s calculated from equation 11 the difference between the values of the peak periods in fig 6 c t 1 2 and 1 5 s and the ones predicted from equation 11 t n 1 41 and 1 75 s can be attributed to the a complex interaction of the two water column masses confined within the chambers of the system that interact together through the radiation phenomenon b influence of the floating device motions and c simplifications applied to develop the indicated mathematical formula stated by equation 11 in this context as it was mathematically proved by rezanejad and guedes soares 2018b the peak periods of the efficiency curve in the wec systems that are constituted from two oscillatory masses like the floating device in this study do not occur necessarily at the independent natural periods of the oscillatory masses consequently a certain difference between the natural frequency of the water columns in owc and bbdb parts with the peak periods of the efficiency curve in fig 6 c is observed it can be deduced that the owc chamber has the main role in absorbing the energy in the proximity periods of t 1 2 s as a the primary efficiency of the owc part η 1 is slightly higher than bbdb part η 2 in fig 6 and b the natural period of the owc part of the system t n 1 41 s calculated from equation 11 is relatively close to the first peak period t 1 2 s however the efficiency of the bbdb part also keeps maintaining the improved performance in this range as well this reveals that probably the mutual interaction between the chambers as it was stated earlier in sections 1 and 2 may induce constructive effects in terms of improving the efficiency even in the chamber in this case bbdb part with the different natural period from the period of the incident wave likewise the similar phenomenon occurs for the second peak t 1 5 s which is relatively close to the natural period of the bbdb part of the system t n 1 75 s in this context the variation of the response amplitude operator rao of the motions of the device in three degrees of freedom surge heave and pitch for the high owc high bbdb damping condition is illustrated in fig 7 the detailed descriptions about the tool and procedure used for measuring the motions of the system are already reported in the recent research study by gadelho et al 2021 and here only the high owc high bbdb damping case is addressed to explore the relative correlation between the motions of the device and its efficiency see gadelho et al 2021 for further discussions regarding the motion characteristics of the system in other damping cases as can be detected in fig 7 the motions of the system in small wave periods close to t 1 2 s are relatively small which allows the owc part similar to the fixed owc systems to harvest the energy of waves effectively on the other hand by increasing the wave period close to t 1 5 s the amplitude of the motions of the device increases enabling the bbdb part to capture the energy of waves more effectively it is noteworthy to remark that the pitch motion plays a dominant role in conventional bbdb devices to capture energy of waves rezanejad and guedes soares 2015 toyota et al 2009 likewise the high amplitude of the pitch motion together with the surge motion which is basically coupled with the pitch causes the higher tendency of the bbdb part to harvest the energy of waves compared to the owc part which can also be recognized by comparing the efficiency of the bbdb and owc parts in fig 6 a and b in large wave periods the heave motion amplitude has the tendency to approach the unit value in higher periods as in long wavelength the system acts relatively similar to a floating particle which follows the free source motions the performance of the floating wec device looks promising in random waves which has the average value over 40 in the entire range of the peak periods studied in this investigation however the performance of the device is suppressed specifically in the lower periods compared to the regular waves as can be seen in fig 6 this is because the random nature of the generated sea states that include various components of waves hence some of the wave components occur with the period less than 1 2 s at which the efficiency of the device is quite reduced thus it influences a certain reduction in the efficiency of the device in random waves the pto damping imposed to the owc part of the device is reduced by increasing the size of the hole in the cap of this part while the damping of the bbdb part maintained fixed as before i e medium owc high bbdb and low owc high bbdb damping conditions and the corresponding results are shown in figs 7 and 8 as can be realized from those figures the performance of the device is specifically reduced in the lower range of wave periods in which the role of the owc part to capture the energy is eliminated the efficiency also reduced in higher wave periods that are close to the natural period of the bbdb part which shows the prominent influence of the mutual interactions between the two chambers to absorb the energy in a wide range of wave periods in other words the radiation effect due to the air pressure inside the owc chamber is suppressed due to reducing the pto damping in figs 8 and 9 therefore the influence of the owc chamber on the bbdb chamber through the air radiation effects is mitigated accordingly on the other hand the efficiency of the bbdb part η 2 is also suppressed at the period t 1 5 s that corresponds to the natural frequency of the bbdb chamber although the pto damping of the owc is reduced it means that loosing pto damping in one chamber and corresponding air radiation effects indirectly affects the efficiency of the other one consequently it can be deduced that the mutual interaction of two chambers through the air radiation effects can cause an increase in the power absorption capacity of the two chambers the influence of the medium owc medium bbdb and low owc low bbdb damping conditions are also investigated and shown in figs 10 and 11 respectively the efficiency of the device is drastically reduced by increasing the size of the holes the pto damping values are reduced in these cases the air pressure in the two chambers has quite slight alternations with the mean value close to the atmospheric pressure as the relatively big holes are used in the cap of the model hence a significant reduction occurs in the performance of the device the average efficiency of the device η for the various pto damping condition is represented in table 1 to provide a quantitative overview regarding the hydrodynamic performance of the device in this context the overall primary efficiency η of the device in the range of the periods peak periods between 1 2 and 1 8 s has been averaged this range covers the wave periods varying between 8 5 and 12 7 s in the prototype case as the scale factor is equal to 50 which includes the most energetic sea states in portuguese oceanic area as can be seen in this table promising results are obtained for the high owc high bbdb damping condition the average efficiency is over 55 in the regular waves and 41 in random waves in this broad range of wave periods although the constant damping is applied to the device reducing the pto damping causes a significant reduction in the average efficiency which reveals that the pto damping has high impact on the overall hydrodynamic performance 6 conclusions a novel concept of a floating wec device with improved hydrodynamic performance is introduced in this research study the device includes two chambers that convert the energy of the incident waves to the pneumatic power similar to owc devices a comprehensive experimental investigation is carried out to study the hydrodynamic performance of the device with different pto damping conditions in regular and irregular waves it was revealed that the device has improved hydrodynamic performance in a broad range of wave periods covering the most probable sea states in portuguese oceanic area in this case the average efficiency of the device was estimated to be over 55 and 41 in the regular and random waves respectively by applying a constant high damping condition in both chambers the hydrodynamic performance can further be improved by implementing appropriate pto controlling tools in the realistic applications it was also observed that the devised concept has the capability to convert all the energy of the incoming waves to pneumatic power in a certain wave condition which was rarely detected in other types of floating wec devices the detailed investigations are carried out to study the role of the two chambers in harnessing the energy it was found that the mutual interaction between the two chambers has a prominent impact on increasing the hydrodynamic performance of the device it is planned to undertake cfd numerical investigations in the future research activities to study the hydrodynamic performance of the devised system as well as its motion characteristics in a more

20601,this paper introduces a dynamic parametric wind farm model that is capable of simulating floating wind turbine platform motion coupled with wake transport under time varying wind conditions the simulator is named fowfsim dyn as it is a dynamic extension of the previously developed steady state floating offshore wind farm simulator fowfsim one dimensional momentum conservation is used to model dynamic propagation of wake centerline locations and average velocities while momentum recovery is approximated with the assumption of a constant temporal wake expansion rate platform dynamics are captured by treating a floating offshore wind farm as a distribution of particles that are subject to aerodynamic hydrodynamic and mooring line forces the finite difference method is used to discretize the momentum conservation equations to yield a nonlinear state space model fowfsim dyn is validated against steady state experimental wind tunnel data obtained from the literature along with simulation results acquired from fast the model is shown to possess a satisfactory level of fidelity for engineering applications finally dynamic simulations are conducted to ensure that time varying predictions match physical expectations and intuition keywords dynamic wind farm model dynamic wake model floating offshore wind farm model floating platform motion time varying wind conditions 1 introduction since the introduction of parametric wake models by jensen 1983 and katić et al 1986 such wind farm simulators have served as essential tools for enhancing wind farm performance this enhancement has been achieved via two distinct fields of study the older of the two is layout optimization wherein the optimal installation locations of wind turbines are computed with the objective of maximizing annual revenue shakoor et al 2016 since such optimization problems are solved offline prior to wind farm construction steady state wake models have sufficed for estimating annual energy production the field of study that has more recently experienced a surge in interest is wind farm control which involves real time wind turbine actuation for the purpose of manipulating the wind field to achieve some wind farm level objective kheirabadi and nagamune 2019 this ultimate goal may be efficiency maximization or power output tracking with turbine load alleviation knudsen et al 2015 in either case since actuators are adjusted in real time dynamic wake phenomena such as turbulence transport delay time varying mean wind speed and direction and floating platform motion for deep water offshore wind farms are pertinent when evaluating controller performance steady parametric wake models have been used successfully to raise wind farm efficiency in large eddy simulations les gebraad et al 2016 and field tests fleming et al 2017 further in one instance gebraad et al 2015 reported no significant performance gains when using a dynamic wake model for wind farm control in contrast to using a steady wake model nonetheless there are benefits associated with using dynamic wake models first traditional state and parameter estimation techniques may be used to adapt such models to time varying wind conditions gebraad et al 2015 second low fidelity dynamic wake models may be used to test controller robustness against time varying wind conditions prior to dedicating time and resources to conducting high fidelity simulations and field tests as performed by johnson and fritsch 2012 and gebraad and van wingerden 2015 further research comparing wind farm control based on dynamic versus steady parametric models may reveal additional benefits such progress will only be possible however provided the availability of various dynamic wake models reviews of wake modeling may be found in the works of boersma et al 2017 göçmen et al 2016 vermeer et al 2003 and in our previous review article kheirabadi and nagamune 2019 we will focus our current discussion on parametric dynamic wake models the earliest of such models found application in power de rating wind farm control research conducted by gebraad and van wingerden 2015 johnson and fritsch 2012 and ahmad et al 2014 power de rating involves reducing the thrust force exerted onto the wind by upstream wind turbines as a means of increasing the fluid momentum available to downstream machines johnson and thomas 2009 since this application involves neither wake deflection nor wind turbine relocation wake dynamics in these studies were modeled using time delays in computed steady state incident wind speeds these time delays represented the duration required for changes in the wind field at some upstream turbine to propagate to downstream machines this approach is valid as long as the wind direction remains constant and wake centerline deflection and turbine relocation are not pertinent in order to account for transport delay of steered wakes gebraad and van wingerden 2014 developed the flow redirection and induction dynamics floridyn model their approach involved representing flow within a wake using translating points that were initialized at each turbine and then transported downstream each point contained information regarding its corresponding turbine s operating parameters at the instant in time at which the point was initialized using this information wake properties at the downstream location of the translating point were obtained using the flow redirection and induction in steady state floris wake model gebraad et al 2016 which utilizes integral forms of mass and momentum conservation to compute downstream wake properties more simply put floridyn transports steady state wake characteristics computed with floris in the free stream wind direction time varying wind direction and floating platform motion are not considered in floridyn however in an alternative approach shapiro et al 2017 used the differential forms of mass and momentum conservation to simulate dynamic wake behavior local and convective wake accelerations in the free stream wind direction were described by material derivatives and these accelerations were equated to force terms representing turbulent mixing and rotor thrust the advantage of this modeling approach was that wake transport would be inherently captured by convective acceleration terms thus eliminating the need for the translating points employed by the floridyn model instead all wake characteristics were functions of a fixed grid in the downstream direction shapiro et al 2018 later extended their model to capture wake redirection resulting from rotor yaw misalignment prandtl s lifting line theory was used to compute transverse wake velocities shed circulation and vortex properties immediately downstream of yawed rotors wake centerline deflection in the free stream wind direction was then computed by equating the material derivative of the centerline position to the transverse component of the wake velocity these works do not capture floating platform motion or time varying wind speed and direction finally boersma et al 2018 developed the wind farm simulator wfsim which is a control oriented dynamic wake model based on the two dimensional form of the unsteady turbulent navier stokes equations the major benefit of wfsim is that individual wake expansion and the interaction of multiple wakes are inherently captured by the mixing length turbulence model employed in the previously discussed models the rate of linear wake expansion was either estimated or assumed further the previous models simulated flow behavior in regions with overlapping wakes by assuming that the effective kinetic energy deficit in the wind field is equal to the sum of deficits corresponding to all pertinent wakes despite its higher fidelity wfsim requires approximately 1000 s of computation for 1000 s of simulation in comparison to previously discussed models several seconds of computation for 1000 s of simulation moreover wfsim does not model floating platform motion or time varying wind speed and direction in the current paper we loosely follow the approach of shapiro et al 2017 whereby partial differential equations are used to capture wake transport and we develop a dynamic parametric wake model capable of simulating time varying wind speed and direction along with platform motion for floating offshore wind farms the novelty of this paper therefore includes the following i additional terms in the wake momentum conservation equations to capture time varying free stream wind velocity effects and ii a coupled dynamic model that captures planar floating wind turbine motion in the presence of aerodynamic interaction i e the inclusion of floating platform dynamics in addition to a wake model our approach is physics based with the rate of wake expansion as the only parametric assumption this model serves as a dynamic extension of our previously developed steady state tool kheirabadi and nagamune 2020 which was named the floating offshore wind farm simulator fowfsim and will henceforth be referred to as fowfsim dyn fixed foundation wind farms may also be modeled by simply deactivating turbine platform motion such a model that can capture time varying wind conditions and floating platform motion is essential for performing preliminary evaluations of wind farm controllers and layout optimization algorithms the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a detailed mathematical description of fowfsim dyn along with a discussion of its limitations in section 3 we perform a mesh convergence study and validate fowfsim dyn s ability to predict floating platform motion and steady and dynamic wake transport we finally conclude the paper in section 4 by listing potential research directions for enhancing fowfsim dyn 2 mathematical model fowfsim dyn this section details the mathematical formulation behind fowfsim dyn first the problem setup solver block diagram and resulting equations of motion are presented in sections 2 1 2 7 finally important assumptions and limitations pertaining to fowfsim dyn are discussed in section 2 8 2 1 wind farm description fig 1 shows a top view schematic of the general floating offshore wind farm that we model in the current work floating wind turbines are treated as a system of particles that are distributed along the two dimensional ocean surface throughout this paper we consider only three cylinder semi submersible floating platforms as per the baseline design presented by robertson et al 2014 each floating structure is therefore connected to three anchors via mooring lines for the purpose of station keeping we define the set ℱ 1 2 n to denote the indices of the n floating wind turbines within the wind farm and we refer to each individual turbine using the identifier i we then number the wind turbines in ascending order based on their downstream location that is to say the most upstream turbine is numbered by i 1 while the most downstream machine is identified by i n the fixed global frame of reference is identified by the x ˆ and y ˆ axes each wind turbine also possesses a local non inertial translating though not rotating reference frame that is attached to its center of gravity we identify the reference frame that is fixed to turbine i as frame i further the axes of frame i are referred to as x ˆ i and y ˆ i we assume that a predominant wind direction exists and that it is aligned with the positive x ˆ axis the free stream wind velocity is then denoted by the vector v t which contains x ˆ and y ˆ components u t and v t as follows 1 v t u t v t t u t therefore represents the free stream wind speed in the predominant wind direction while v t accounts for fluctuations in the transverse free stream wind speed 2 2 states and inputs ultimately fowfsim dyn takes the following nonlinear state space form 2 x farm t f x farm t u farm t v t where the wind farm state vector x farm t combines the floating wind turbine state vector x t with the wake state vector x w t as follows 3 x farm t x t t x w t t t the wind turbine state vector x t comprises the position and velocity vectors of all floating wind turbines within the wind farm as follows 4 x t r 1 t t r 2 t t r n t t v 1 t t v 2 t t v n t t t where r i t and v i t are vectors containing x ˆ and y ˆ components of the position and velocity of turbine i as follows 5 r i t x i t y i t t 6 v i t v x i t v y i t t the wake state vector x w t contains the states of the wakes generated by the n floating wind turbines as follows 7 x w t x w 1 t t x w 2 t t x w n t t t assuming that the states of wake i are defined at n p i discrete points along the downstream direction x w i t comprises the states of wake i at each of these discrete points as follows 8 x w i t x w i 1 t t x w i 2 t t x w i n p i t t t the state vector x w i p t at each point p along wake i then consists of the wake centerline location y w i p t wake velocity components u w i p t and v w i p t which correspond to the x ˆ i and y ˆ i directions and the wake diameter d w i p t as follows 9 x w i p t y w i p t u w i p t v w i p t d w i p t t these wake characteristics are portrayed in fig 6 and discussed in section 2 6 the wind farm input vector u farm t contains the input vectors for the n floating wind turbines as follows 10 u farm t u 1 t t u 2 t t u n t t t where u i t consists of the axial induction factor a i t and yaw angle γ i t of turbine i as follows 11 u i t a i t γ i t t with all yaw angles defined as positive counter clockwise from the x ˆ axis 2 3 solver block diagram the block diagram for fowfsim dyn is shown in fig 2 the simulator consists of two main modules the aerodynamics module requires the states x t and inputs u t of all turbines along with the free stream wind velocity and acceleration vectors v t and v t at time t its function is to compute the effective wind velocity vector v i t that is incident on the rotor of turbine i for all i f the floating turbine dynamics module uses these incident wind velocity vectors along with turbine states and inputs to compute the rates of change of turbine states x i t at time t using a standard ordinary differential equation solver state derivatives are integrated to compute state trajectories over time this module also computes the power outputs of individual wind turbines as well as that of the entire wind farm p farm t 2 4 wind farm power output the total power output of the wind farm p farm t is computed as the sum of electricity production from all wind turbines as follows 12 p farm t i ℱ p i t where p i t is the power output of turbine i and is estimated assuming steady state performance as follows manwell et al 2009 13 p i t 1 8 c p i t ρ a π d i 2 v rel i t 3 d i is rotor diameter of turbine i ρ a is the density of air and v rel i t is the wind velocity that is incident upon the rotor of turbine i from the perspective of an observer who is fixed to turbine i referring to fig 3 v rel i t is defined as follows 14 v rel i t v i t v i t where v i t is the velocity vector of turbine i and v i t is the wind velocity vector in the global frame that is incident upon the rotor of turbine i with the following x ˆ and y ˆ components 15 v i t u i t v i t t v i t is calculated using the wake interaction model discussed in section 2 7 the power coefficient c p i t of turbine i is computed based on the vortex cylinder model of a yawed actuator disc as follows burton et al 2011 16 c p i t 4 a i t cos γ rel i t a i t cos γ rel i t tan χ i t 2 sin γ rel i t a i t sec 2 χ i t 2 where a i t is the axial induction factor of turbine i and as per fig 3 γ rel i t is the yaw misalignment of turbine i relative to v rel i t as follows 17 γ rel i t γ i t θ i t in the above expression γ i t is the yaw angle of turbine i and θ i t is the angle of v rel i t relative to the positive x ˆ axis as follows 18 θ i t tan 1 v i t v y i t u i t v x i t finally χ i t is the wake skew angle immediately past the rotor of turbine i and is approximated as follows burton et al 2011 19 χ i t 0 6 a i t 1 γ rel i t 2 5 floating wind turbine motion the rates of change of the position and velocity of turbine i are expressed as follows 20 r i t v i t 21 v i t f i t m i m a i where m i is the mass of floating wind turbine i the added mass 1 1 added mass accounts for hydrodynamic loads that act upon an object that is accelerating with respect to the surrounding fluid it compounds with hydrodynamic drag forces which are typically modeled as functions of instantaneous velocity only m a i associated with turbine i will be discussed along with the hydrodynamic drag force as shown in fig 4 the total force f i t acting on turbine i is the sum of its respective aerodynamic hydrodynamic and mooring line forces as follows 22 f i t f a i t f h i t f m i t the aerodynamic thrust force f a i t acting on the rotor of turbine i is expressed as follows 23 f a i t 1 8 c t i t ρ a π d i 2 v rel i t 2 n i t where the thrust coefficient c t i t is computed based on the vortex cylinder model of a yawed actuator disc as follows burton et al 2011 24 c t i t 4 a i t cos γ rel i t tan χ i t 2 sin γ rel i t a i t sec 2 χ i t 2 and n i t is a unit vector normal to the rotor of turbine i as follows 25 n i t cos γ i t sin γ i t t based on elementary fluid mechanics principles concerning immersed bodies f h i t is approximated by summing the drag force contributions of all submerged components of turbine i as follows 26 f h i t 1 2 j d i c d i j a d i j ρ w w t v i t w t v i t where ρ w is the density of ocean water and w t is the ocean current velocity vector which we assume to be w t 0 m s in this work let the set d i 1 2 n h i denote the indices of all submerged components that contribute to the hydrodynamic drag force acting on turbine i with n h i being equal to the total number of submerged components of turbine i c d i j and a d i j are thereby the drag coefficient and reference area of the j th submerged component of turbine i in a similar manner the total added mass m a i associated with turbine i is estimated by summing the added mass contributions of all submerged components of turbine i as follows 27 m a i ρ w j d i c a i j a a i j where c a i j is the added mass coefficient of the j th submerged component of turbine i and a a i j is the added mass reference area of the same component let the set ℳ i 1 2 n m i denote the indices of all mooring lines connected to turbine i with n m i being equal to the total number of mooring lines attached to turbine i f m i t may then be expressed as the sum of all mooring force contributions acting on turbine i as follows 28 f m i t k ℳ i f m i k t where f m i k t is the restoring force exerted on turbine i by its k th mooring line this force is calculated by first finding the magnitude of the horizontal component of tension within mooring line k of turbine i and then projecting this tension in the appropriate direction as follows 29 f m i k t h f i k t r f a i k t r f a i k t the function h f i k t outputs the horizontal component of tension along the k th mooring line of turbine i this function is generated by solving the static differential equations describing a suspended cable which is either partially contacting or fully lifted above the seabed the relevant formulae are provided in appendix b and are also available in our previous publication kheirabadi and nagamune 2020 as shown in fig 5 the term r f a i k t describes the position vector from the anchor of the k th mooring line of turbine i to the corresponding fairlead and is expressed as follows 30 r f a i k t r i t r f g i k r a i k where r f g i k is a constant position vector from the center of gravity of turbine i to the fairlead that connects to the k th mooring line of the same turbine and r a i k is a constant position vector representing the location of the anchor of the same mooring line in eq 29 dividing r f a i k t by its euclidean norm therefore produces a unit vector that points from the anchor of the k th mooring line of turbine i to the corresponding fairlead the restoring force associated with this mooring line pulls the turbine in the opposite direction 2 6 single wake model fig 6 shows the characteristics of interest when modeling wake i which is the wake generated by the rotor of turbine i these characteristics include the wake s centerline position y w i x ˆ i t relative to the x ˆ i axis its average velocity vector v w i x ˆ i t measured in frame i and its diameter d w i x ˆ i t two key assumptions are necessary for justifying the mathematical formulation presented in this section first if fluctuations in the wind direction relative to the x ˆ i axes are presumed to be small then all wake characteristics may be defined as smooth functions of only x ˆ i and t furthermore wake cross sections may be assumed to always remain normal to the predominant flow direction which corresponds to the positive x ˆ and x ˆ i axes in our work second if the free stream wind speed is presumed to be significantly larger than the velocities of floating platforms then the equations of motion describing any wake may be defined relative to a reference frame that is fixed to the wake generating turbine the frame of reference shown in fig 6 is therefore non inertial and translates with turbine i while y w i x ˆ i t v w i x ˆ i t and d w i x ˆ i t are defined in this translating frame this approach eliminates the need to model wake behavior upstream of turbine i while removing time dependency from the wake centerline boundary condition i e y w i x ˆ i t is always equal to zero at x ˆ i 0 m granting these preliminaries the equations of motion describing wake i may now be derived specifically we shall present partial differential equations that model wake average velocities wake centerline locations and wake diameters over space and time let the vector l i x ˆ i t describe the linear momentum deficit of wake i per unit length along the x ˆ i axis as follows 31 l i x ˆ i t ρ a π 4 d w i 2 x ˆ i t v t v i t v w i x ˆ i t as v w i x ˆ i t is measured in frame i the term v i t v w i x ˆ i t redefines the velocity of wake i in the global frame since no external forces impact wake i the time derivative of l i x ˆ i t must equate to zero which results in the following momentum conservation equation 32 v w i x ˆ i t t u t v x i t v w i x ˆ i t x ˆ i v t v i t 2 d w i x ˆ i t d d w i x ˆ i t d t v t v i t v w i x ˆ i t the time derivative of y w i x ˆ i t must equate to the y ˆ i component of v w i x ˆ i t which results in the following expression describing the wake centerline location 33 y w i x ˆ i t t u t v x i t y w i x ˆ i t x ˆ i v w i x ˆ i t in eqs 32 and 33 u w i x ˆ i t and v w i x ˆ i t are the x ˆ i and y ˆ i components of v w i x ˆ i t v x i t is the velocity of turbine i in the x ˆ direction u t is the free stream wind speed in the x ˆ direction and the term u t v x i t serves as the transport speed in the x ˆ i direction when modeling fluids using the three dimensional navier stokes equations the transport and fluid velocities at any given point are equal following this logic the transport speed in eqs 32 and 33 should simply be u w i x ˆ i t however when neglecting three dimensional effects it is debatable exactly how the transport velocity should be defined our simulations indicate that defining the transport speed as the free stream wind speed defined in frame i yields predictions closer to experimental observations than does setting the transport speed to u w i x ˆ i t finally the terms v t and v t that appear in eq 32 upon taking the time derivative of l i x ˆ i t are part of the novelty of the current work these terms capture time varying effects of the free stream wind velocity on wake dynamics in steady state parametric wake models the wake diameter is typically assumed to grow at a constant spatial expansion rate k x along the downstream direction when modeling wakes dynamically however we assume that wake diameters grow at a constant temporal expansion rate k t in other words the time derivative of d w i x ˆ i t must equate to k t as follows 34 d w i x ˆ i t t u t v x i t d w i x ˆ i t x ˆ i k t if the spatial expansion rate k x under steady state conditions is known for some reference free stream wind speed u ref the temporal expansion rate at u ref must be k t k x u ref assuming that the free stream wind speed v t does not vary significantly from u ref then k t may be assumed to remain constant in order to obtain the wake states employed in eq 9 the spatial gradients in eqs 32 33 and 34 must be discretized over some fixed downstream distance using the finite difference method which would yield a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that would be rearranged to state space form we will not present the discretized forms of these equations as the finite difference method is an elementary numerical technique when implementing the above solution we recommend the following initial conditions 35 y w i x ˆ i 0 v 0 u 0 x ˆ i 36 v w i x ˆ i 0 v 0 v i 0 37 d w i x ˆ i 0 d i k x x ˆ i which ensure respectively that all wake centerlines are initially aligned with the free stream wind wake velocities are initially equal to the free stream wind velocity and that wake diameters initially grow at a predefined spatial rate k x note that d i is the diameter of turbine i with regards to boundary conditions the following are necessary based on assumptions inherent to fowfsim dyn 38 y w i 0 t 0 39 v w i 0 t v w init i t 40 d w i 0 t d i eq 38 states that the centerline of wake i at x ˆ i 0 m must always correspond to the location of turbine i which is in fact the origin of frame i eq 39 states that the velocity of wake i at x ˆ i 0 m must always be equal to the wake velocity v w init i t immediately downstream of the rotor of turbine i finally eq 40 requires that the diameter of wake i at the location of turbine i is always equal to the rotor diameter of this turbine we calculate the velocity vector v w init i t based on simplifications made to glauert s momentum theory burton et al 2011 by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 as follows 41 v w init i t v rel i t 1 c t i t cos ξ w init i t θ i t sin ξ w init i t θ i t where ξ w init i t is the initial wake skew angle which is expressed as follows based on a momentum conservation derivation reported by jiménez et al 2009 42 ξ w init i t c t i t 2 cos 2 γ rel i t sin γ rel i t the derivation by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 assumes that the free stream wind velocity is aligned with the x ˆ axis as a result the addition of θ i t to ξ w init i t in eq 41 accounts for the misalignment of v t relative to the x ˆ axis there exist alternative approaches for estimating wake velocities immediately downstream of turbine rotors in particular shapiro et al 2018 used a lifting line approach to predict transverse wake velocities downstream of rotors and to detail additional wake characteristics such as vorticity 2 7 wake interaction model when a wind turbine rotor is influenced by wakes that are generated from multiple upstream turbines a wake interaction model is necessary for approximating the resultant effective wind speed that is incident on the downstream rotor the most commonly used wake interaction technique is based on the assumption that the effective kinetic energy deficit at the location of the downstream rotor must be equal to the sum of kinetic energy deficits of all pertinent wakes katić et al 1986 as a result the effective wind speed at the downstream rotor is a function of the root sum square of relevant wake velocity deficits further enhancement may be obtained by approximating wake velocity profiles using gaussian distributions bastankhah and porté agel 2016 we continue to make use of this wake interaction methodology it should be noted that the effective kinetic energy deficit approach does not account for planetary boundary layer effects that have non trivial impact of the power production of large wind farms the model presented by stevens et al 2016 captures such effects and may be incorporated into the current framework let the set u i 1 2 i 1 denote the indices of all turbines that are located upstream of turbine i the effective wind velocity vector that is incident on the rotor of turbine i may therefore be expressed as follows 43 v i t v t q u i v t v w q i t n t 2 n t where n t is a unit vector aligned with v t as follows 44 n t v t v t and v w q i t is the effective velocity of wake q that is incident upon the rotor of wake i eq 43 projects v w q i t along the free stream wind direction hence the dot product operation with n t and then computes the velocity deficit in this direction average wake velocities perpendicular to the free stream wind direction are assumed to be negligibly small far enough downstream their effects are therefore neglected we now describe our procedure for computing v w q i t let v w q i t denote the average velocity of wake q at the location of wake i as follows 45 v w q i t v q t v w q x i t x q t t since the average velocity vector of wake q is defined in frame q the substitution x ˆ q x i t x q t into v w q x ˆ q t is necessary for identifying the location of turbine i in frame q the addition of the turbine velocity vector v q t then transforms v w q x i t x q t t to the global frame the next step is to generate a gaussian profile v w q i r t where r is the radial distance from the centerline of wake q to approximate the continuous velocity distribution of wake q at the location of wake i imposing a requirement that the total momentum deficit of v t v w q i r t per unit length must equate that of a top hat distribution with amplitude v t v w q i t as follows 46 0 ρ a 2 π r v t v w q i r t d r ρ a π 4 d w q i t v t v w q i t the following gaussian profile is then obtained 47 v t v w q i r t 1 8 d w q i t σ 2 v t v w q i t exp r 2 2 σ 2 where d w q i t is the diameter of wake q at the location of turbine i as follows 48 d w q i d w q x i t x q t t the standard deviation σ in eq 47 may be estimated based on experimental or high fidelity numerical data finally the effective velocity v w q i t is obtained by averaging v w q i r t along the rotor area a i of turbine i this task is achieved by numerically computing the following integral at each time step 49 v w q i t 4 π d i 2 a i v w q i r t d a the above method is solely valid for the far wake region since it does not account for top hat wake velocity profiles that occur in near wake regions the approach presented by shapiro et al 2019 offers techniques for predicting top hat velocity profiles in near wake regions which ultimately transition to gaussian shapes in far wake regions 2 8 model limitations several assumptions have been made when developing fowfsim dyn which impose limitations on its fidelity and applicability the current subsection summarizes these limitations 2 8 1 two dimensional floating wind turbine dynamics the first and most crucial of these assumptions is that floating platform motion may be adequately captured using a two dimensional planar model that is to say we neglect floating platform heave yaw pitch and roll in consequence fowfsim dyn fails to capture dynamic effects induced by ocean waves and oscillatory wind conditions on platform rotation fowfsim dyn remains appropriate for wind farm controller design and testing since this application is primarily concerned with average rotor positions over extended periods of time however any attempt to control or evaluate individual wind turbine dynamics requires the use of three dimensional multi body nonlinear modeling tools 2 8 2 steady state mooring line model although we present a dynamic model mooring line tensions are found based on the solution to a static suspended cable problem it has been reported by hall et al 2014 that such static models accurately predict mooring line loads and floating wind turbine motion thus rendering them appropriate for wind farm control however hall et al 2014 also mentioned that use of such models may lead to large inaccuracies in turbine load predictions therefore analysis and control of individual turbine motion must consider higher fidelity modeling techniques such as a lumped mass dynamic mooring line model hall and goupee 2015 2 8 3 steady state turbine aerodynamics turbine power outputs and thrust forces eqs 13 and 23 along with their respective coefficients eqs 16 and 24 are calculated based on steady state actuator disc theory this approach assumes ideal rotors and fails to capture unsteady aerodynamic effects and asymmetric rotor loadings these phenomena significantly influence blade loads when yaw misalignment occurs however for the purpose of wind farm control our focus lies on the overall influence of rotor operation on fully developed wake regions nonetheless any turbine level analysis requires more detailed fluid structure interaction modeling the computation of v w init i t in eq 41 which is the average wake velocity immediately downstream of turbine i relies on a steady state momentum balance on a control volume spanning across the rotor of turbine i as a result momentum fluxes into and out of this control volume are considered while the rate of change of momentum within the control volume is neglected given the low density of air these inertial effects may be neglected although their significance should be investigated 2 8 4 sources of wake deflection fowfsim dyn does not capture wake centerline deflection caused by rotor rotation this phenomenon was first observed in high fidelity simulations conducted by gebraad et al 2016 however more recent work by fleming et al 2018 showed that the scale of this phenomenon is insignificant instead fleming et al 2018 observed that vortices generated by turbine rotors induce wake deflection past downstream machines even if their rotors are not operated with yaw offset additional terms may be added to eqs 32 and 33 to account for such phenomena 2 8 5 spatial uniformity and consistency of the free stream wind in the current paper we have assumed that the free stream wind velocity is uniform throughout the wind farm which is why the variable v t is solely a function of time this variable may readily be expressed as v x ˆ t if spatial variations of the free stream wind velocity are known furthermore in order to represent wake characteristics purely as a function of the downstream distance along the x ˆ i axes while ignoring changes in the cross sectional areas of wakes we assumed that variations in the free stream wind direction are small the y ˆ component of the free stream wind velocity must therefore remain small in comparison to its x ˆ component 3 model validation in this section we first perform a mesh sensitivity analysis to ascertain the dependency of model predictions upon the size of finite difference elements in section 3 1 we then validate fowfsim dyn s capacity for predicting floating platform motion in section 3 2 and wake transport in sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 1 mesh sensitivity analysis for a mesh sensitivity study we simulate the experimental setup employed by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 namely the wake of a single fixed foundation turbine with diameter d 15 cm is simulated with a steady free stream wind speed of u 4 88 m s the turbine s axial induction factor is set to the optimal value of a 1 3 and a yaw angle of γ 20 is implemented to observe mesh effects on wake deflection to approximate steady state results all simulations are run for a duration of 5 s and data is extracted from the final time step the gaussian profile standard deviation is set to σ 0 025 x ˆ 0 396 m based on experimental data 2 2 velocity profiles corresponding to a yaw angle of γ 0 from fig 21 in the paper by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 were digitized and gaussian function curve fitting was used to compute the standard deviation reported by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 the diametrical spatial wake expansion constant is set to k x 0 08 as per the recommendation by shakoor et al 2016 simulated wake centerlines and normalized velocity deficit profiles at a downstream distance of 7 d are plotted in fig 7 for different finite difference element sizes qualitatively it is apparent that the evolution of the wake centerline is insignificantly influenced by the mesh size at x ˆ d 16 the centerline deflection obtained using an element size of 8 d only differs by 5 relative to the value corresponding to an element size of 0 25 d as a result we solely utilize the maximum normalized velocity deficit as a convergence criterion table 1 lists the computation times corresponding to different element sizes from fig 7 as well as predicted maximum normalized velocity deficits dynamic simulations were performed using the matlab fourth order runge kutta solver implemented on a laptop computer with a 2 80 ghz intel core i7 7700hq processor table 1 also lists the convergence of the maximum normalized velocity deficit as the element size is decreased we observe that mesh sensitivity is sufficiently reduced at an element size of 1 d since further reduction to 0 5 d only results in a 0 69 change in the predicted maximum normalized velocity deficit an element size of 1 d is also appropriate from the standpoint of time efficiency as it requires 3 2 s of computation time to run a 5 s simulation 3 2 validation of platform dynamics to validate the platform dynamics module of fowfsim dyn we compare its predictions for a single floating wind turbine against those of the national renewable energy laboratory s nrel s wind turbine modeling software fatigue aerodynamics structures and turbulence fast in fig 8 fast is a widely accepted tool for modeling three dimensional floating offshore wind turbine dynamics and has been experimentally validated in the context of semi submersible floating platforms by coulling et al 2013 results presented in fig 8 were obtained using a steady free stream wind speed of u 10 m s optimal axial induction a yaw angle of γ 15 and mooring line cable lengths of l 850 m in fast simulations all floating platform degrees of freedom were enabled the simulated wind turbine is based on nrel s 5 mw baseline design presented by jonkman et al 2009 and the floating platform and mooring subsystem is modeled after the design described by robertson et al 2014 details corresponding to these designs are listed in appendix a fig 8 also includes fowfsim dyn predictions with the static mooring line model replaced by the dynamic lumped parameter cable model presented by hall et al 2014 this result is identified by fowfsim dyn in the figure legend from a qualitative standpoint fig 8 shows that all models predict the expected platform motion in the downwind and crosswind directions since the turbine nacelle is yawed counterclockwise by γ 15 aerodynamic forces displace the floating platform in the positive crosswind direction there is little discrepancy between fast and fowfsim dyn predictions with regards to platform displacement in the downwind direction the root mean square error rmse between these datasets is 1 37 m which is 8 5 of the steady state downwind platform displacement of 16 1 m predicted by fast when examining crosswind platform displacement the rmse value between fast and fowfsim dyn predictions rises to 2 74 m one method for assessing the significance of this error is to compute the normalized overlap area noa between turbines rotors from the two simulations the noa is the overlap area between the rotors of turbines normalized against the rotor area therefore if the crosswind displacements of two turbines are identical then the noa between their rotors must be unity if on the other hand the crosswind displacements are so substantial that rotor overlap is completely eliminated then the noa will be zero since the ultimate purpose of fowfsim dyn is to predict wind farm power output which due to the wake effect is primarily depended upon the projected overlap areas between the rotors of adjacent turbines the noa is a meaningful metric for evaluating the effectiveness of fowfsim dyn in predicting crosswind platform motion the rmse value of 2 74 m corresponds to an noa of 97 2 that is when wind farm level performance is of concern fowfsim dyn predicts projected rotor overlap areas between adjacent turbines with a discrepancy of 2 8 one major source of error between fast and fowfsim dyn predictions is that fast uses actuator line theory to predict aerodynamic loads while fowfsim dyn utilizes actuator disc theory this source of error may be mitigated by computing aerodynamic loads in fowfsim dyn using thrust coefficient values obtained from fast further the presence of all six platform degrees of freedom in fast contributes to the discrepancy in oscillation periods observed in fig 8 finally the mooring line modeling approach is a non trivial contributing factor fast utilizes the lumped parameter dynamic mooring line model proposed by hall et al 2014 while fowfsim dyn employs a static catenary model the inclusion of fowfsim dyn curves in fig 8 isolates the error introduced by switching between static and dynamic mooring line models comparing fowfsim dyn to fowfsim dyn plots a noticeable discrepancy in the oscillation period is introduced while rmse values between the two curves are 1 26 and 0 87 m in the downwind and crosswind directions 3 3 steady state validation of wake transport in this section fowfsim dyn predictions of steady state wake centerlines and normalized velocity profiles are compared against experimental results reported by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 the experimental setup consists of a 15 cm diameter scaled fixed foundation wind turbine subject to 8 m s steady wind speed while operating with optimal axial induction and various nacelle yaw angles the comparison between these experimental results and fowfsim dyn predictions are plotted in fig 9 wake centerline evolutions are well predicted for all simulated yaw angles and downstream locations for yaw angles of γ 0 10 and 20 maximum discrepancies between predicted wake centerlines and experimental measurements are 6 87 7 60 and 8 19 of the rotor diameter respectively simulated normalized velocity profiles deviate significantly from experimental measurements at downstream locations closer than 7 d for instance at a yaw angle of γ 0 the rmse between experimental and predicted velocity profiles ranges from 12 4 of the free stream wind speed at x ˆ 4 d to 4 7 at x ˆ 7 d such inaccuracies at close downstream distances are expected since fowfsim dyn does not consider the inviscid nature of flow within the near wake region beyond x ˆ 7 d velocity profiles are well predicted with rmse values that remain below 3 87 of the free stream wind speed 3 4 dynamic assessment of wake transport our final task is to assess fowfsim dyn s capability to predict dynamic wake transport phenomena due to the lack of published experimental data on unsteady wake transport we perform this final task by running unique simulation scenarios and ensuring that the corresponding results match intuitive expectations the wind farm configuration that is used for dynamic simulations is shown in fig 10 this plant contains a single row of three floating offshore wind turbines that are aligned with the predominant free stream wind direction the neutral positions of the floating turbines are spaced 7 d apart all wind turbines are based on nrel s 5 mw baseline design presented by jonkman et al 2009 and all floating platforms and mooring subsystems are modeled after the design described by robertson et al 2014 details corresponding to these designs are listed in appendix a in all simulations we increase the lengths of mooring lines from their baseline values i e l 835 m to l 900 m to render floating platform motion more notable in all the following cases less than 10 s of computation time was required to complete simulations on a laptop computer with a 2 80 ghz intel core i7 7700hq processor 3 4 1 simulation scenario 1 the first of three simulated scenarios maintains constant wind speed and direction with u t 8 m s and v t 0 m s while rotor yaw angles are fixed at γ 1 t γ 3 t 20 and γ 2 t 20 all axial induction factors are maintained at a 1 t a 2 t a 3 t 1 3 all floating platforms are locked at their neutral positions for the first 1000 s of simulation after which they are permitted to relocate the aim of this scenario is to assess floating platform motion snapshots of velocity contours for simulation scenario 1 are shown in fig 11 as expected the alternating assignment of yaw angles causes adjacent floating platforms to shift in opposite directions over time further the leading turbine displays the greatest amount of relocation from its neutral position i e the left most white symbol since its incident wind speed is the largest i e its incident wind speed is the free stream wind speed uninhibited by upstream rotors the trailing turbine undergoes the smallest amount of relocation over time since its incident wind speed is diminished by the velocity deficits of wakes 1 and 2 3 4 2 simulation scenario 2 the second simulation sinusoidally varies the yaw angles of the three turbines between 20 with a period of 400 s specifically the following yaw angle expressions are used for t 1000 s 50 γ 1 t γ 3 t 20 sin 2 π 400 t 1000 s 51 γ 2 t 20 sin 2 π 400 t 1000 s velocity contours for this case are plotted in fig 12 the sinusoidal yaw angle fluctuations cause oscillations of floating platforms in the y ˆ direction with the expected 400 s excitation period in terms of wake behavior the transport effect is clearly observed as floating turbines shift in the y ˆ direction the corresponding effects on their respective wakes are transported downstream at approximately 8 m s for instance at t 1400 s the leading turbine is located at a peak value past its neutral position in the y ˆ direction see the first vertical white dashed line in fig 12 given that u 8 m s then 200 s later the centerline of the leading turbine s wake must peak in the y ˆ direction at x ˆ 8 m s 200 s 1600 m 12 7 d observing the velocity contours 200 s later at t 1600 s such a peak is observed at just under x ˆ 12 d see the second vertical white dashed line in fig 12 3 4 3 simulation scenario 3 the third scenario assesses the impacts of time varying wind direction which is modeled by maintaining u t 8 m s and fluctuating v t sinusoidally between 2 m s with a period of 200 s specifically v t is expressed as follows for t 1000 s 52 v t 2 m s sin 2 π 200 t 1000 s all yaw angles in this scenario are maintained at γ 1 t γ 2 t γ 3 t 0 velocity contours for simulation case 3 are shown in fig 13 the notable expectation here is that as the wind direction changes wake centerlines are transported in tandem with the free stream wind in both x ˆ and y ˆ directions for instance at t 1000 s the centerline of wake 1 is aligned with the x ˆ axis since γ 1 t 0 and v t had been equal to zero at all previous times by t 1050 s the effects of turbine 1 on the wind field should only be transported downstream by a distance of 8 m s 50 s 400 m 3 2 d therefore for x ˆ 3 2 d we expect variations in the curvature of the centerline of wake 1 due to the presence of turbine 1 while for x ˆ 3 2 d this curvature should remain unchanged instead for x ˆ 3 2 d the centerline of wake 1 should be shifted in the y ˆ direction as a result of v t having held positive values for the past 50 s observing velocity contours at t 1050 s it is evident that the centerline curvature of wake 1 remains flat at all downstream distances past approximately x ˆ 3 d while having been shifted in the y ˆ direction 4 conclusions and recommendations for future research this paper extended fowfsim kheirabadi and nagamune 2020 which is a steady state modeling tool that may be used for simulating and optimizing floating offshore wind farms by adding capabilities that captured time varying free stream wind velocities and floating platform motion in addition to presenting a mathematical formulation we performed a mesh convergence study and validated fowfsim dyn predictions related to platform motion and steady wake transport it was demonstrated that the limited number of tunable parameters produced wake centerline deflection and velocity deficit results that matched experimental observations with reasonable similarity for engineering analysis we then conducted simulations under various wind and turbine operating conditions to assess the dynamic behavior of fowfsim dyn it was observed that fowfsim dyn captures dynamic floating wind farm phenomena such as wake transport time varying wind speed and direction effects and floating platform motion in line with physical reasoning and intuition for the purposes of further developing and enhancing the current framework several recommendations on potential research directions are made first to this date no les based wind farm simulators are capable of capturing floating platform motion developing wind farm cfd tools that consider such dynamics would therefore permit more comprehensive validation of fowfsim dyn predictions pertaining to both platform motion and wake behavior complementing this point scaled wind tunnel experiments of floating wind turbines would also enable validation of dynamic fowfsim dyn predictions second we did not model turbulence in the current framework this feature may be incorporated by adding measurement noise to model outputs or by including temporally and spatially distributed turbulence acceleration terms in the equations of motion finally additional force gradients may be included in the equations of motion to capture complex wake phenomena such as secondary

properties see table a 2 appendix b formulae for computing mooring line tension this appendix section briefly details the formulae used to calculate the horizontal component of tension within any mooring line cable derivations of the following formulae may be found in our previous work kheirabadi and nagamune 2020 for readability we drop functional time dependency indicators and subscripts i e h f i k t simply becomes h f since the discussed solution is static and all formulae remain the same for any individual mooring line cable we begin by defining three zones of mooring line operation the first zone is in effect when the fairlead is close enough to its respective anchor that the cable is vertical at the fairlead location the resulting horizontal component of tension is zero in this case the second zone of operation occurs when the cable is partially contacting the seabed while the third zone is relevant when the cable is fully lifted off of the seabed based on these definitions we define h f as follows b 1 h f 0 if x f x f 1 2 f 1 if x f 1 2 x f x f 2 3 f 2 if x f x f 2 3 where x f is the horizontal distance from the fairlead to its respective anchor as follows b 2 x f r f a

the length specific weight in water cross sectional area and elastic modulus of the cable z f is the vertical distance between the fairlead and its respective anchor and h 2 3 is the horizontal

20601,this paper introduces a dynamic parametric wind farm model that is capable of simulating floating wind turbine platform motion coupled with wake transport under time varying wind conditions the simulator is named fowfsim dyn as it is a dynamic extension of the previously developed steady state floating offshore wind farm simulator fowfsim one dimensional momentum conservation is used to model dynamic propagation of wake centerline locations and average velocities while momentum recovery is approximated with the assumption of a constant temporal wake expansion rate platform dynamics are captured by treating a floating offshore wind farm as a distribution of particles that are subject to aerodynamic hydrodynamic and mooring line forces the finite difference method is used to discretize the momentum conservation equations to yield a nonlinear state space model fowfsim dyn is validated against steady state experimental wind tunnel data obtained from the literature along with simulation results acquired from fast the model is shown to possess a satisfactory level of fidelity for engineering applications finally dynamic simulations are conducted to ensure that time varying predictions match physical expectations and intuition keywords dynamic wind farm model dynamic wake model floating offshore wind farm model floating platform motion time varying wind conditions 1 introduction since the introduction of parametric wake models by jensen 1983 and katić et al 1986 such wind farm simulators have served as essential tools for enhancing wind farm performance this enhancement has been achieved via two distinct fields of study the older of the two is layout optimization wherein the optimal installation locations of wind turbines are computed with the objective of maximizing annual revenue shakoor et al 2016 since such optimization problems are solved offline prior to wind farm construction steady state wake models have sufficed for estimating annual energy production the field of study that has more recently experienced a surge in interest is wind farm control which involves real time wind turbine actuation for the purpose of manipulating the wind field to achieve some wind farm level objective kheirabadi and nagamune 2019 this ultimate goal may be efficiency maximization or power output tracking with turbine load alleviation knudsen et al 2015 in either case since actuators are adjusted in real time dynamic wake phenomena such as turbulence transport delay time varying mean wind speed and direction and floating platform motion for deep water offshore wind farms are pertinent when evaluating controller performance steady parametric wake models have been used successfully to raise wind farm efficiency in large eddy simulations les gebraad et al 2016 and field tests fleming et al 2017 further in one instance gebraad et al 2015 reported no significant performance gains when using a dynamic wake model for wind farm control in contrast to using a steady wake model nonetheless there are benefits associated with using dynamic wake models first traditional state and parameter estimation techniques may be used to adapt such models to time varying wind conditions gebraad et al 2015 second low fidelity dynamic wake models may be used to test controller robustness against time varying wind conditions prior to dedicating time and resources to conducting high fidelity simulations and field tests as performed by johnson and fritsch 2012 and gebraad and van wingerden 2015 further research comparing wind farm control based on dynamic versus steady parametric models may reveal additional benefits such progress will only be possible however provided the availability of various dynamic wake models reviews of wake modeling may be found in the works of boersma et al 2017 göçmen et al 2016 vermeer et al 2003 and in our previous review article kheirabadi and nagamune 2019 we will focus our current discussion on parametric dynamic wake models the earliest of such models found application in power de rating wind farm control research conducted by gebraad and van wingerden 2015 johnson and fritsch 2012 and ahmad et al 2014 power de rating involves reducing the thrust force exerted onto the wind by upstream wind turbines as a means of increasing the fluid momentum available to downstream machines johnson and thomas 2009 since this application involves neither wake deflection nor wind turbine relocation wake dynamics in these studies were modeled using time delays in computed steady state incident wind speeds these time delays represented the duration required for changes in the wind field at some upstream turbine to propagate to downstream machines this approach is valid as long as the wind direction remains constant and wake centerline deflection and turbine relocation are not pertinent in order to account for transport delay of steered wakes gebraad and van wingerden 2014 developed the flow redirection and induction dynamics floridyn model their approach involved representing flow within a wake using translating points that were initialized at each turbine and then transported downstream each point contained information regarding its corresponding turbine s operating parameters at the instant in time at which the point was initialized using this information wake properties at the downstream location of the translating point were obtained using the flow redirection and induction in steady state floris wake model gebraad et al 2016 which utilizes integral forms of mass and momentum conservation to compute downstream wake properties more simply put floridyn transports steady state wake characteristics computed with floris in the free stream wind direction time varying wind direction and floating platform motion are not considered in floridyn however in an alternative approach shapiro et al 2017 used the differential forms of mass and momentum conservation to simulate dynamic wake behavior local and convective wake accelerations in the free stream wind direction were described by material derivatives and these accelerations were equated to force terms representing turbulent mixing and rotor thrust the advantage of this modeling approach was that wake transport would be inherently captured by convective acceleration terms thus eliminating the need for the translating points employed by the floridyn model instead all wake characteristics were functions of a fixed grid in the downstream direction shapiro et al 2018 later extended their model to capture wake redirection resulting from rotor yaw misalignment prandtl s lifting line theory was used to compute transverse wake velocities shed circulation and vortex properties immediately downstream of yawed rotors wake centerline deflection in the free stream wind direction was then computed by equating the material derivative of the centerline position to the transverse component of the wake velocity these works do not capture floating platform motion or time varying wind speed and direction finally boersma et al 2018 developed the wind farm simulator wfsim which is a control oriented dynamic wake model based on the two dimensional form of the unsteady turbulent navier stokes equations the major benefit of wfsim is that individual wake expansion and the interaction of multiple wakes are inherently captured by the mixing length turbulence model employed in the previously discussed models the rate of linear wake expansion was either estimated or assumed further the previous models simulated flow behavior in regions with overlapping wakes by assuming that the effective kinetic energy deficit in the wind field is equal to the sum of deficits corresponding to all pertinent wakes despite its higher fidelity wfsim requires approximately 1000 s of computation for 1000 s of simulation in comparison to previously discussed models several seconds of computation for 1000 s of simulation moreover wfsim does not model floating platform motion or time varying wind speed and direction in the current paper we loosely follow the approach of shapiro et al 2017 whereby partial differential equations are used to capture wake transport and we develop a dynamic parametric wake model capable of simulating time varying wind speed and direction along with platform motion for floating offshore wind farms the novelty of this paper therefore includes the following i additional terms in the wake momentum conservation equations to capture time varying free stream wind velocity effects and ii a coupled dynamic model that captures planar floating wind turbine motion in the presence of aerodynamic interaction i e the inclusion of floating platform dynamics in addition to a wake model our approach is physics based with the rate of wake expansion as the only parametric assumption this model serves as a dynamic extension of our previously developed steady state tool kheirabadi and nagamune 2020 which was named the floating offshore wind farm simulator fowfsim and will henceforth be referred to as fowfsim dyn fixed foundation wind farms may also be modeled by simply deactivating turbine platform motion such a model that can capture time varying wind conditions and floating platform motion is essential for performing preliminary evaluations of wind farm controllers and layout optimization algorithms the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provides a detailed mathematical description of fowfsim dyn along with a discussion of its limitations in section 3 we perform a mesh convergence study and validate fowfsim dyn s ability to predict floating platform motion and steady and dynamic wake transport we finally conclude the paper in section 4 by listing potential research directions for enhancing fowfsim dyn 2 mathematical model fowfsim dyn this section details the mathematical formulation behind fowfsim dyn first the problem setup solver block diagram and resulting equations of motion are presented in sections 2 1 2 7 finally important assumptions and limitations pertaining to fowfsim dyn are discussed in section 2 8 2 1 wind farm description fig 1 shows a top view schematic of the general floating offshore wind farm that we model in the current work floating wind turbines are treated as a system of particles that are distributed along the two dimensional ocean surface throughout this paper we consider only three cylinder semi submersible floating platforms as per the baseline design presented by robertson et al 2014 each floating structure is therefore connected to three anchors via mooring lines for the purpose of station keeping we define the set ℱ 1 2 n to denote the indices of the n floating wind turbines within the wind farm and we refer to each individual turbine using the identifier i we then number the wind turbines in ascending order based on their downstream location that is to say the most upstream turbine is numbered by i 1 while the most downstream machine is identified by i n the fixed global frame of reference is identified by the x ˆ and y ˆ axes each wind turbine also possesses a local non inertial translating though not rotating reference frame that is attached to its center of gravity we identify the reference frame that is fixed to turbine i as frame i further the axes of frame i are referred to as x ˆ i and y ˆ i we assume that a predominant wind direction exists and that it is aligned with the positive x ˆ axis the free stream wind velocity is then denoted by the vector v t which contains x ˆ and y ˆ components u t and v t as follows 1 v t u t v t t u t therefore represents the free stream wind speed in the predominant wind direction while v t accounts for fluctuations in the transverse free stream wind speed 2 2 states and inputs ultimately fowfsim dyn takes the following nonlinear state space form 2 x farm t f x farm t u farm t v t where the wind farm state vector x farm t combines the floating wind turbine state vector x t with the wake state vector x w t as follows 3 x farm t x t t x w t t t the wind turbine state vector x t comprises the position and velocity vectors of all floating wind turbines within the wind farm as follows 4 x t r 1 t t r 2 t t r n t t v 1 t t v 2 t t v n t t t where r i t and v i t are vectors containing x ˆ and y ˆ components of the position and velocity of turbine i as follows 5 r i t x i t y i t t 6 v i t v x i t v y i t t the wake state vector x w t contains the states of the wakes generated by the n floating wind turbines as follows 7 x w t x w 1 t t x w 2 t t x w n t t t assuming that the states of wake i are defined at n p i discrete points along the downstream direction x w i t comprises the states of wake i at each of these discrete points as follows 8 x w i t x w i 1 t t x w i 2 t t x w i n p i t t t the state vector x w i p t at each point p along wake i then consists of the wake centerline location y w i p t wake velocity components u w i p t and v w i p t which correspond to the x ˆ i and y ˆ i directions and the wake diameter d w i p t as follows 9 x w i p t y w i p t u w i p t v w i p t d w i p t t these wake characteristics are portrayed in fig 6 and discussed in section 2 6 the wind farm input vector u farm t contains the input vectors for the n floating wind turbines as follows 10 u farm t u 1 t t u 2 t t u n t t t where u i t consists of the axial induction factor a i t and yaw angle γ i t of turbine i as follows 11 u i t a i t γ i t t with all yaw angles defined as positive counter clockwise from the x ˆ axis 2 3 solver block diagram the block diagram for fowfsim dyn is shown in fig 2 the simulator consists of two main modules the aerodynamics module requires the states x t and inputs u t of all turbines along with the free stream wind velocity and acceleration vectors v t and v t at time t its function is to compute the effective wind velocity vector v i t that is incident on the rotor of turbine i for all i f the floating turbine dynamics module uses these incident wind velocity vectors along with turbine states and inputs to compute the rates of change of turbine states x i t at time t using a standard ordinary differential equation solver state derivatives are integrated to compute state trajectories over time this module also computes the power outputs of individual wind turbines as well as that of the entire wind farm p farm t 2 4 wind farm power output the total power output of the wind farm p farm t is computed as the sum of electricity production from all wind turbines as follows 12 p farm t i ℱ p i t where p i t is the power output of turbine i and is estimated assuming steady state performance as follows manwell et al 2009 13 p i t 1 8 c p i t ρ a π d i 2 v rel i t 3 d i is rotor diameter of turbine i ρ a is the density of air and v rel i t is the wind velocity that is incident upon the rotor of turbine i from the perspective of an observer who is fixed to turbine i referring to fig 3 v rel i t is defined as follows 14 v rel i t v i t v i t where v i t is the velocity vector of turbine i and v i t is the wind velocity vector in the global frame that is incident upon the rotor of turbine i with the following x ˆ and y ˆ components 15 v i t u i t v i t t v i t is calculated using the wake interaction model discussed in section 2 7 the power coefficient c p i t of turbine i is computed based on the vortex cylinder model of a yawed actuator disc as follows burton et al 2011 16 c p i t 4 a i t cos γ rel i t a i t cos γ rel i t tan χ i t 2 sin γ rel i t a i t sec 2 χ i t 2 where a i t is the axial induction factor of turbine i and as per fig 3 γ rel i t is the yaw misalignment of turbine i relative to v rel i t as follows 17 γ rel i t γ i t θ i t in the above expression γ i t is the yaw angle of turbine i and θ i t is the angle of v rel i t relative to the positive x ˆ axis as follows 18 θ i t tan 1 v i t v y i t u i t v x i t finally χ i t is the wake skew angle immediately past the rotor of turbine i and is approximated as follows burton et al 2011 19 χ i t 0 6 a i t 1 γ rel i t 2 5 floating wind turbine motion the rates of change of the position and velocity of turbine i are expressed as follows 20 r i t v i t 21 v i t f i t m i m a i where m i is the mass of floating wind turbine i the added mass 1 1 added mass accounts for hydrodynamic loads that act upon an object that is accelerating with respect to the surrounding fluid it compounds with hydrodynamic drag forces which are typically modeled as functions of instantaneous velocity only m a i associated with turbine i will be discussed along with the hydrodynamic drag force as shown in fig 4 the total force f i t acting on turbine i is the sum of its respective aerodynamic hydrodynamic and mooring line forces as follows 22 f i t f a i t f h i t f m i t the aerodynamic thrust force f a i t acting on the rotor of turbine i is expressed as follows 23 f a i t 1 8 c t i t ρ a π d i 2 v rel i t 2 n i t where the thrust coefficient c t i t is computed based on the vortex cylinder model of a yawed actuator disc as follows burton et al 2011 24 c t i t 4 a i t cos γ rel i t tan χ i t 2 sin γ rel i t a i t sec 2 χ i t 2 and n i t is a unit vector normal to the rotor of turbine i as follows 25 n i t cos γ i t sin γ i t t based on elementary fluid mechanics principles concerning immersed bodies f h i t is approximated by summing the drag force contributions of all submerged components of turbine i as follows 26 f h i t 1 2 j d i c d i j a d i j ρ w w t v i t w t v i t where ρ w is the density of ocean water and w t is the ocean current velocity vector which we assume to be w t 0 m s in this work let the set d i 1 2 n h i denote the indices of all submerged components that contribute to the hydrodynamic drag force acting on turbine i with n h i being equal to the total number of submerged components of turbine i c d i j and a d i j are thereby the drag coefficient and reference area of the j th submerged component of turbine i in a similar manner the total added mass m a i associated with turbine i is estimated by summing the added mass contributions of all submerged components of turbine i as follows 27 m a i ρ w j d i c a i j a a i j where c a i j is the added mass coefficient of the j th submerged component of turbine i and a a i j is the added mass reference area of the same component let the set ℳ i 1 2 n m i denote the indices of all mooring lines connected to turbine i with n m i being equal to the total number of mooring lines attached to turbine i f m i t may then be expressed as the sum of all mooring force contributions acting on turbine i as follows 28 f m i t k ℳ i f m i k t where f m i k t is the restoring force exerted on turbine i by its k th mooring line this force is calculated by first finding the magnitude of the horizontal component of tension within mooring line k of turbine i and then projecting this tension in the appropriate direction as follows 29 f m i k t h f i k t r f a i k t r f a i k t the function h f i k t outputs the horizontal component of tension along the k th mooring line of turbine i this function is generated by solving the static differential equations describing a suspended cable which is either partially contacting or fully lifted above the seabed the relevant formulae are provided in appendix b and are also available in our previous publication kheirabadi and nagamune 2020 as shown in fig 5 the term r f a i k t describes the position vector from the anchor of the k th mooring line of turbine i to the corresponding fairlead and is expressed as follows 30 r f a i k t r i t r f g i k r a i k where r f g i k is a constant position vector from the center of gravity of turbine i to the fairlead that connects to the k th mooring line of the same turbine and r a i k is a constant position vector representing the location of the anchor of the same mooring line in eq 29 dividing r f a i k t by its euclidean norm therefore produces a unit vector that points from the anchor of the k th mooring line of turbine i to the corresponding fairlead the restoring force associated with this mooring line pulls the turbine in the opposite direction 2 6 single wake model fig 6 shows the characteristics of interest when modeling wake i which is the wake generated by the rotor of turbine i these characteristics include the wake s centerline position y w i x ˆ i t relative to the x ˆ i axis its average velocity vector v w i x ˆ i t measured in frame i and its diameter d w i x ˆ i t two key assumptions are necessary for justifying the mathematical formulation presented in this section first if fluctuations in the wind direction relative to the x ˆ i axes are presumed to be small then all wake characteristics may be defined as smooth functions of only x ˆ i and t furthermore wake cross sections may be assumed to always remain normal to the predominant flow direction which corresponds to the positive x ˆ and x ˆ i axes in our work second if the free stream wind speed is presumed to be significantly larger than the velocities of floating platforms then the equations of motion describing any wake may be defined relative to a reference frame that is fixed to the wake generating turbine the frame of reference shown in fig 6 is therefore non inertial and translates with turbine i while y w i x ˆ i t v w i x ˆ i t and d w i x ˆ i t are defined in this translating frame this approach eliminates the need to model wake behavior upstream of turbine i while removing time dependency from the wake centerline boundary condition i e y w i x ˆ i t is always equal to zero at x ˆ i 0 m granting these preliminaries the equations of motion describing wake i may now be derived specifically we shall present partial differential equations that model wake average velocities wake centerline locations and wake diameters over space and time let the vector l i x ˆ i t describe the linear momentum deficit of wake i per unit length along the x ˆ i axis as follows 31 l i x ˆ i t ρ a π 4 d w i 2 x ˆ i t v t v i t v w i x ˆ i t as v w i x ˆ i t is measured in frame i the term v i t v w i x ˆ i t redefines the velocity of wake i in the global frame since no external forces impact wake i the time derivative of l i x ˆ i t must equate to zero which results in the following momentum conservation equation 32 v w i x ˆ i t t u t v x i t v w i x ˆ i t x ˆ i v t v i t 2 d w i x ˆ i t d d w i x ˆ i t d t v t v i t v w i x ˆ i t the time derivative of y w i x ˆ i t must equate to the y ˆ i component of v w i x ˆ i t which results in the following expression describing the wake centerline location 33 y w i x ˆ i t t u t v x i t y w i x ˆ i t x ˆ i v w i x ˆ i t in eqs 32 and 33 u w i x ˆ i t and v w i x ˆ i t are the x ˆ i and y ˆ i components of v w i x ˆ i t v x i t is the velocity of turbine i in the x ˆ direction u t is the free stream wind speed in the x ˆ direction and the term u t v x i t serves as the transport speed in the x ˆ i direction when modeling fluids using the three dimensional navier stokes equations the transport and fluid velocities at any given point are equal following this logic the transport speed in eqs 32 and 33 should simply be u w i x ˆ i t however when neglecting three dimensional effects it is debatable exactly how the transport velocity should be defined our simulations indicate that defining the transport speed as the free stream wind speed defined in frame i yields predictions closer to experimental observations than does setting the transport speed to u w i x ˆ i t finally the terms v t and v t that appear in eq 32 upon taking the time derivative of l i x ˆ i t are part of the novelty of the current work these terms capture time varying effects of the free stream wind velocity on wake dynamics in steady state parametric wake models the wake diameter is typically assumed to grow at a constant spatial expansion rate k x along the downstream direction when modeling wakes dynamically however we assume that wake diameters grow at a constant temporal expansion rate k t in other words the time derivative of d w i x ˆ i t must equate to k t as follows 34 d w i x ˆ i t t u t v x i t d w i x ˆ i t x ˆ i k t if the spatial expansion rate k x under steady state conditions is known for some reference free stream wind speed u ref the temporal expansion rate at u ref must be k t k x u ref assuming that the free stream wind speed v t does not vary significantly from u ref then k t may be assumed to remain constant in order to obtain the wake states employed in eq 9 the spatial gradients in eqs 32 33 and 34 must be discretized over some fixed downstream distance using the finite difference method which would yield a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that would be rearranged to state space form we will not present the discretized forms of these equations as the finite difference method is an elementary numerical technique when implementing the above solution we recommend the following initial conditions 35 y w i x ˆ i 0 v 0 u 0 x ˆ i 36 v w i x ˆ i 0 v 0 v i 0 37 d w i x ˆ i 0 d i k x x ˆ i which ensure respectively that all wake centerlines are initially aligned with the free stream wind wake velocities are initially equal to the free stream wind velocity and that wake diameters initially grow at a predefined spatial rate k x note that d i is the diameter of turbine i with regards to boundary conditions the following are necessary based on assumptions inherent to fowfsim dyn 38 y w i 0 t 0 39 v w i 0 t v w init i t 40 d w i 0 t d i eq 38 states that the centerline of wake i at x ˆ i 0 m must always correspond to the location of turbine i which is in fact the origin of frame i eq 39 states that the velocity of wake i at x ˆ i 0 m must always be equal to the wake velocity v w init i t immediately downstream of the rotor of turbine i finally eq 40 requires that the diameter of wake i at the location of turbine i is always equal to the rotor diameter of this turbine we calculate the velocity vector v w init i t based on simplifications made to glauert s momentum theory burton et al 2011 by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 as follows 41 v w init i t v rel i t 1 c t i t cos ξ w init i t θ i t sin ξ w init i t θ i t where ξ w init i t is the initial wake skew angle which is expressed as follows based on a momentum conservation derivation reported by jiménez et al 2009 42 ξ w init i t c t i t 2 cos 2 γ rel i t sin γ rel i t the derivation by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 assumes that the free stream wind velocity is aligned with the x ˆ axis as a result the addition of θ i t to ξ w init i t in eq 41 accounts for the misalignment of v t relative to the x ˆ axis there exist alternative approaches for estimating wake velocities immediately downstream of turbine rotors in particular shapiro et al 2018 used a lifting line approach to predict transverse wake velocities downstream of rotors and to detail additional wake characteristics such as vorticity 2 7 wake interaction model when a wind turbine rotor is influenced by wakes that are generated from multiple upstream turbines a wake interaction model is necessary for approximating the resultant effective wind speed that is incident on the downstream rotor the most commonly used wake interaction technique is based on the assumption that the effective kinetic energy deficit at the location of the downstream rotor must be equal to the sum of kinetic energy deficits of all pertinent wakes katić et al 1986 as a result the effective wind speed at the downstream rotor is a function of the root sum square of relevant wake velocity deficits further enhancement may be obtained by approximating wake velocity profiles using gaussian distributions bastankhah and porté agel 2016 we continue to make use of this wake interaction methodology it should be noted that the effective kinetic energy deficit approach does not account for planetary boundary layer effects that have non trivial impact of the power production of large wind farms the model presented by stevens et al 2016 captures such effects and may be incorporated into the current framework let the set u i 1 2 i 1 denote the indices of all turbines that are located upstream of turbine i the effective wind velocity vector that is incident on the rotor of turbine i may therefore be expressed as follows 43 v i t v t q u i v t v w q i t n t 2 n t where n t is a unit vector aligned with v t as follows 44 n t v t v t and v w q i t is the effective velocity of wake q that is incident upon the rotor of wake i eq 43 projects v w q i t along the free stream wind direction hence the dot product operation with n t and then computes the velocity deficit in this direction average wake velocities perpendicular to the free stream wind direction are assumed to be negligibly small far enough downstream their effects are therefore neglected we now describe our procedure for computing v w q i t let v w q i t denote the average velocity of wake q at the location of wake i as follows 45 v w q i t v q t v w q x i t x q t t since the average velocity vector of wake q is defined in frame q the substitution x ˆ q x i t x q t into v w q x ˆ q t is necessary for identifying the location of turbine i in frame q the addition of the turbine velocity vector v q t then transforms v w q x i t x q t t to the global frame the next step is to generate a gaussian profile v w q i r t where r is the radial distance from the centerline of wake q to approximate the continuous velocity distribution of wake q at the location of wake i imposing a requirement that the total momentum deficit of v t v w q i r t per unit length must equate that of a top hat distribution with amplitude v t v w q i t as follows 46 0 ρ a 2 π r v t v w q i r t d r ρ a π 4 d w q i t v t v w q i t the following gaussian profile is then obtained 47 v t v w q i r t 1 8 d w q i t σ 2 v t v w q i t exp r 2 2 σ 2 where d w q i t is the diameter of wake q at the location of turbine i as follows 48 d w q i d w q x i t x q t t the standard deviation σ in eq 47 may be estimated based on experimental or high fidelity numerical data finally the effective velocity v w q i t is obtained by averaging v w q i r t along the rotor area a i of turbine i this task is achieved by numerically computing the following integral at each time step 49 v w q i t 4 π d i 2 a i v w q i r t d a the above method is solely valid for the far wake region since it does not account for top hat wake velocity profiles that occur in near wake regions the approach presented by shapiro et al 2019 offers techniques for predicting top hat velocity profiles in near wake regions which ultimately transition to gaussian shapes in far wake regions 2 8 model limitations several assumptions have been made when developing fowfsim dyn which impose limitations on its fidelity and applicability the current subsection summarizes these limitations 2 8 1 two dimensional floating wind turbine dynamics the first and most crucial of these assumptions is that floating platform motion may be adequately captured using a two dimensional planar model that is to say we neglect floating platform heave yaw pitch and roll in consequence fowfsim dyn fails to capture dynamic effects induced by ocean waves and oscillatory wind conditions on platform rotation fowfsim dyn remains appropriate for wind farm controller design and testing since this application is primarily concerned with average rotor positions over extended periods of time however any attempt to control or evaluate individual wind turbine dynamics requires the use of three dimensional multi body nonlinear modeling tools 2 8 2 steady state mooring line model although we present a dynamic model mooring line tensions are found based on the solution to a static suspended cable problem it has been reported by hall et al 2014 that such static models accurately predict mooring line loads and floating wind turbine motion thus rendering them appropriate for wind farm control however hall et al 2014 also mentioned that use of such models may lead to large inaccuracies in turbine load predictions therefore analysis and control of individual turbine motion must consider higher fidelity modeling techniques such as a lumped mass dynamic mooring line model hall and goupee 2015 2 8 3 steady state turbine aerodynamics turbine power outputs and thrust forces eqs 13 and 23 along with their respective coefficients eqs 16 and 24 are calculated based on steady state actuator disc theory this approach assumes ideal rotors and fails to capture unsteady aerodynamic effects and asymmetric rotor loadings these phenomena significantly influence blade loads when yaw misalignment occurs however for the purpose of wind farm control our focus lies on the overall influence of rotor operation on fully developed wake regions nonetheless any turbine level analysis requires more detailed fluid structure interaction modeling the computation of v w init i t in eq 41 which is the average wake velocity immediately downstream of turbine i relies on a steady state momentum balance on a control volume spanning across the rotor of turbine i as a result momentum fluxes into and out of this control volume are considered while the rate of change of momentum within the control volume is neglected given the low density of air these inertial effects may be neglected although their significance should be investigated 2 8 4 sources of wake deflection fowfsim dyn does not capture wake centerline deflection caused by rotor rotation this phenomenon was first observed in high fidelity simulations conducted by gebraad et al 2016 however more recent work by fleming et al 2018 showed that the scale of this phenomenon is insignificant instead fleming et al 2018 observed that vortices generated by turbine rotors induce wake deflection past downstream machines even if their rotors are not operated with yaw offset additional terms may be added to eqs 32 and 33 to account for such phenomena 2 8 5 spatial uniformity and consistency of the free stream wind in the current paper we have assumed that the free stream wind velocity is uniform throughout the wind farm which is why the variable v t is solely a function of time this variable may readily be expressed as v x ˆ t if spatial variations of the free stream wind velocity are known furthermore in order to represent wake characteristics purely as a function of the downstream distance along the x ˆ i axes while ignoring changes in the cross sectional areas of wakes we assumed that variations in the free stream wind direction are small the y ˆ component of the free stream wind velocity must therefore remain small in comparison to its x ˆ component 3 model validation in this section we first perform a mesh sensitivity analysis to ascertain the dependency of model predictions upon the size of finite difference elements in section 3 1 we then validate fowfsim dyn s capacity for predicting floating platform motion in section 3 2 and wake transport in sections 3 3 and 3 4 3 1 mesh sensitivity analysis for a mesh sensitivity study we simulate the experimental setup employed by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 namely the wake of a single fixed foundation turbine with diameter d 15 cm is simulated with a steady free stream wind speed of u 4 88 m s the turbine s axial induction factor is set to the optimal value of a 1 3 and a yaw angle of γ 20 is implemented to observe mesh effects on wake deflection to approximate steady state results all simulations are run for a duration of 5 s and data is extracted from the final time step the gaussian profile standard deviation is set to σ 0 025 x ˆ 0 396 m based on experimental data 2 2 velocity profiles corresponding to a yaw angle of γ 0 from fig 21 in the paper by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 were digitized and gaussian function curve fitting was used to compute the standard deviation reported by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 the diametrical spatial wake expansion constant is set to k x 0 08 as per the recommendation by shakoor et al 2016 simulated wake centerlines and normalized velocity deficit profiles at a downstream distance of 7 d are plotted in fig 7 for different finite difference element sizes qualitatively it is apparent that the evolution of the wake centerline is insignificantly influenced by the mesh size at x ˆ d 16 the centerline deflection obtained using an element size of 8 d only differs by 5 relative to the value corresponding to an element size of 0 25 d as a result we solely utilize the maximum normalized velocity deficit as a convergence criterion table 1 lists the computation times corresponding to different element sizes from fig 7 as well as predicted maximum normalized velocity deficits dynamic simulations were performed using the matlab fourth order runge kutta solver implemented on a laptop computer with a 2 80 ghz intel core i7 7700hq processor table 1 also lists the convergence of the maximum normalized velocity deficit as the element size is decreased we observe that mesh sensitivity is sufficiently reduced at an element size of 1 d since further reduction to 0 5 d only results in a 0 69 change in the predicted maximum normalized velocity deficit an element size of 1 d is also appropriate from the standpoint of time efficiency as it requires 3 2 s of computation time to run a 5 s simulation 3 2 validation of platform dynamics to validate the platform dynamics module of fowfsim dyn we compare its predictions for a single floating wind turbine against those of the national renewable energy laboratory s nrel s wind turbine modeling software fatigue aerodynamics structures and turbulence fast in fig 8 fast is a widely accepted tool for modeling three dimensional floating offshore wind turbine dynamics and has been experimentally validated in the context of semi submersible floating platforms by coulling et al 2013 results presented in fig 8 were obtained using a steady free stream wind speed of u 10 m s optimal axial induction a yaw angle of γ 15 and mooring line cable lengths of l 850 m in fast simulations all floating platform degrees of freedom were enabled the simulated wind turbine is based on nrel s 5 mw baseline design presented by jonkman et al 2009 and the floating platform and mooring subsystem is modeled after the design described by robertson et al 2014 details corresponding to these designs are listed in appendix a fig 8 also includes fowfsim dyn predictions with the static mooring line model replaced by the dynamic lumped parameter cable model presented by hall et al 2014 this result is identified by fowfsim dyn in the figure legend from a qualitative standpoint fig 8 shows that all models predict the expected platform motion in the downwind and crosswind directions since the turbine nacelle is yawed counterclockwise by γ 15 aerodynamic forces displace the floating platform in the positive crosswind direction there is little discrepancy between fast and fowfsim dyn predictions with regards to platform displacement in the downwind direction the root mean square error rmse between these datasets is 1 37 m which is 8 5 of the steady state downwind platform displacement of 16 1 m predicted by fast when examining crosswind platform displacement the rmse value between fast and fowfsim dyn predictions rises to 2 74 m one method for assessing the significance of this error is to compute the normalized overlap area noa between turbines rotors from the two simulations the noa is the overlap area between the rotors of turbines normalized against the rotor area therefore if the crosswind displacements of two turbines are identical then the noa between their rotors must be unity if on the other hand the crosswind displacements are so substantial that rotor overlap is completely eliminated then the noa will be zero since the ultimate purpose of fowfsim dyn is to predict wind farm power output which due to the wake effect is primarily depended upon the projected overlap areas between the rotors of adjacent turbines the noa is a meaningful metric for evaluating the effectiveness of fowfsim dyn in predicting crosswind platform motion the rmse value of 2 74 m corresponds to an noa of 97 2 that is when wind farm level performance is of concern fowfsim dyn predicts projected rotor overlap areas between adjacent turbines with a discrepancy of 2 8 one major source of error between fast and fowfsim dyn predictions is that fast uses actuator line theory to predict aerodynamic loads while fowfsim dyn utilizes actuator disc theory this source of error may be mitigated by computing aerodynamic loads in fowfsim dyn using thrust coefficient values obtained from fast further the presence of all six platform degrees of freedom in fast contributes to the discrepancy in oscillation periods observed in fig 8 finally the mooring line modeling approach is a non trivial contributing factor fast utilizes the lumped parameter dynamic mooring line model proposed by hall et al 2014 while fowfsim dyn employs a static catenary model the inclusion of fowfsim dyn curves in fig 8 isolates the error introduced by switching between static and dynamic mooring line models comparing fowfsim dyn to fowfsim dyn plots a noticeable discrepancy in the oscillation period is introduced while rmse values between the two curves are 1 26 and 0 87 m in the downwind and crosswind directions 3 3 steady state validation of wake transport in this section fowfsim dyn predictions of steady state wake centerlines and normalized velocity profiles are compared against experimental results reported by bastankhah and porté agel 2016 the experimental setup consists of a 15 cm diameter scaled fixed foundation wind turbine subject to 8 m s steady wind speed while operating with optimal axial induction and various nacelle yaw angles the comparison between these experimental results and fowfsim dyn predictions are plotted in fig 9 wake centerline evolutions are well predicted for all simulated yaw angles and downstream locations for yaw angles of γ 0 10 and 20 maximum discrepancies between predicted wake centerlines and experimental measurements are 6 87 7 60 and 8 19 of the rotor diameter respectively simulated normalized velocity profiles deviate significantly from experimental measurements at downstream locations closer than 7 d for instance at a yaw angle of γ 0 the rmse between experimental and predicted velocity profiles ranges from 12 4 of the free stream wind speed at x ˆ 4 d to 4 7 at x ˆ 7 d such inaccuracies at close downstream distances are expected since fowfsim dyn does not consider the inviscid nature of flow within the near wake region beyond x ˆ 7 d velocity profiles are well predicted with rmse values that remain below 3 87 of the free stream wind speed 3 4 dynamic assessment of wake transport our final task is to assess fowfsim dyn s capability to predict dynamic wake transport phenomena due to the lack of published experimental data on unsteady wake transport we perform this final task by running unique simulation scenarios and ensuring that the corresponding results match intuitive expectations the wind farm configuration that is used for dynamic simulations is shown in fig 10 this plant contains a single row of three floating offshore wind turbines that are aligned with the predominant free stream wind direction the neutral positions of the floating turbines are spaced 7 d apart all wind turbines are based on nrel s 5 mw baseline design presented by jonkman et al 2009 and all floating platforms and mooring subsystems are modeled after the design described by robertson et al 2014 details corresponding to these designs are listed in appendix a in all simulations we increase the lengths of mooring lines from their baseline values i e l 835 m to l 900 m to render floating platform motion more notable in all the following cases less than 10 s of computation time was required to complete simulations on a laptop computer with a 2 80 ghz intel core i7 7700hq processor 3 4 1 simulation scenario 1 the first of three simulated scenarios maintains constant wind speed and direction with u t 8 m s and v t 0 m s while rotor yaw angles are fixed at γ 1 t γ 3 t 20 and γ 2 t 20 all axial induction factors are maintained at a 1 t a 2 t a 3 t 1 3 all floating platforms are locked at their neutral positions for the first 1000 s of simulation after which they are permitted to relocate the aim of this scenario is to assess floating platform motion snapshots of velocity contours for simulation scenario 1 are shown in fig 11 as expected the alternating assignment of yaw angles causes adjacent floating platforms to shift in opposite directions over time further the leading turbine displays the greatest amount of relocation from its neutral position i e the left most white symbol since its incident wind speed is the largest i e its incident wind speed is the free stream wind speed uninhibited by upstream rotors the trailing turbine undergoes the smallest amount of relocation over time since its incident wind speed is diminished by the velocity deficits of wakes 1 and 2 3 4 2 simulation scenario 2 the second simulation sinusoidally varies the yaw angles of the three turbines between 20 with a period of 400 s specifically the following yaw angle expressions are used for t 1000 s 50 γ 1 t γ 3 t 20 sin 2 π 400 t 1000 s 51 γ 2 t 20 sin 2 π 400 t 1000 s velocity contours for this case are plotted in fig 12 the sinusoidal yaw angle fluctuations cause oscillations of floating platforms in the y ˆ direction with the expected 400 s excitation period in terms of wake behavior the transport effect is clearly observed as floating turbines shift in the y ˆ direction the corresponding effects on their respective wakes are transported downstream at approximately 8 m s for instance at t 1400 s the leading turbine is located at a peak value past its neutral position in the y ˆ direction see the first vertical white dashed line in fig 12 given that u 8 m s then 200 s later the centerline of the leading turbine s wake must peak in the y ˆ direction at x ˆ 8 m s 200 s 1600 m 12 7 d observing the velocity contours 200 s later at t 1600 s such a peak is observed at just under x ˆ 12 d see the second vertical white dashed line in fig 12 3 4 3 simulation scenario 3 the third scenario assesses the impacts of time varying wind direction which is modeled by maintaining u t 8 m s and fluctuating v t sinusoidally between 2 m s with a period of 200 s specifically v t is expressed as follows for t 1000 s 52 v t 2 m s sin 2 π 200 t 1000 s all yaw angles in this scenario are maintained at γ 1 t γ 2 t γ 3 t 0 velocity contours for simulation case 3 are shown in fig 13 the notable expectation here is that as the wind direction changes wake centerlines are transported in tandem with the free stream wind in both x ˆ and y ˆ directions for instance at t 1000 s the centerline of wake 1 is aligned with the x ˆ axis since γ 1 t 0 and v t had been equal to zero at all previous times by t 1050 s the effects of turbine 1 on the wind field should only be transported downstream by a distance of 8 m s 50 s 400 m 3 2 d therefore for x ˆ 3 2 d we expect variations in the curvature of the centerline of wake 1 due to the presence of turbine 1 while for x ˆ 3 2 d this curvature should remain unchanged instead for x ˆ 3 2 d the centerline of wake 1 should be shifted in the y ˆ direction as a result of v t having held positive values for the past 50 s observing velocity contours at t 1050 s it is evident that the centerline curvature of wake 1 remains flat at all downstream distances past approximately x ˆ 3 d while having been shifted in the y ˆ direction 4 conclusions and recommendations for future research this paper extended fowfsim kheirabadi and nagamune 2020 which is a steady state modeling tool that may be used for simulating and optimizing floating offshore wind farms by adding capabilities that captured time varying free stream wind velocities and floating platform motion in addition to presenting a mathematical formulation we performed a mesh convergence study and validated fowfsim dyn predictions related to platform motion and steady wake transport it was demonstrated that the limited number of tunable parameters produced wake centerline deflection and velocity deficit results that matched experimental observations with reasonable similarity for engineering analysis we then conducted simulations under various wind and turbine operating conditions to assess the dynamic behavior of fowfsim dyn it was observed that fowfsim dyn captures dynamic floating wind farm phenomena such as wake transport time varying wind speed and direction effects and floating platform motion in line with physical reasoning and intuition for the purposes of further developing and enhancing the current framework several recommendations on potential research directions are made first to this date no les based wind farm simulators are capable of capturing floating platform motion developing wind farm cfd tools that consider such dynamics would therefore permit more comprehensive validation of fowfsim dyn predictions pertaining to both platform motion and wake behavior complementing this point scaled wind tunnel experiments of floating wind turbines would also enable validation of dynamic fowfsim dyn predictions second we did not model turbulence in the current framework this feature may be incorporated by adding measurement noise to model outputs or by including temporally and spatially distributed turbulence acceleration terms in the equations of motion finally additional force gradients may be included in the equations of motion to capture complex wake phenomena such as secondary

properties see table a 2 appendix b formulae for computing mooring line tension this appendix section briefly details the formulae used to calculate the horizontal component of tension within any mooring line cable derivations of the following formulae may be found in our previous work kheirabadi and nagamune 2020 for readability we drop functional time dependency indicators and subscripts i e h f i k t simply becomes h f since the discussed solution is static and all formulae remain the same for any individual mooring line cable we begin by defining three zones of mooring line operation the first zone is in effect when the fairlead is close enough to its respective anchor that the cable is vertical at the fairlead location the resulting horizontal component of tension is zero in this case the second zone of operation occurs when the cable is partially contacting the seabed while the third zone is relevant when the cable is fully lifted off of the seabed based on these definitions we define h f as follows b 1 h f 0 if x f x f 1 2 f 1 if x f 1 2 x f x f 2 3 f 2 if x f x f 2 3 where x f is the horizontal distance from the fairlead to its respective anchor as follows b 2 x f r f a i k and the fairlead locations of transition between the different zones are computed as follows b 3 x f 1 2 l z f b 4 x f 2 3 h 2 3 w w l a m e sinh 1 w l h 2 3 the parameters l w a m and e represent the length specific weight in water cross sectional area and elastic modulus of the cable z f is the vertical distance between the fairlead and its respective anchor and h 2 3 is the horizontal

20602,most sea trials of large merchant ships are carried out with the filling ballast water in cargo and the trial environment may involve mild waves as well it causes the ship to undergo a coupling effect between external wave excitation and internal sloshing motion and an understanding of such coupling is important to analyze the components of the total resistance measured in sea trials in this study a blunt modified wigley equipped with two inner tanks is selected to observe its hydrodynamic responses under head waves using both experimental measurement and numerical computations ship is considered to have a forward motion at the froude number of 0 2 and three filling conditions varying from low filling to high filling have been arranged for two inner tanks for validation numerical computation is performed based on the three dimensional rankine panel method with the linearized boundary value problems both seakeeping and internal sloshing flow are analyzed using the linear potential theory the validation presents a sufficient agreement between experimental measurement and numerical results with or without the sloshing effect and both two methods have shown that the sloshing coupling effect is generally insignificant for present ship model however when the wave encounter frequency becomes very close to the tank natural frequency the medium filling tanks generate a strong coupling effect which can restrain ship motion responses as well as added resistance keywords sloshing coupled effect sea trial added resistance 1 introduction to conduct ship sea trials filling ballast water is typically used to fit the design load waterline which means a different condition compared with the ship of solid cargo such as bulk carrier or container ship considering the real sea trial environment that involves mild waves and other natural conditions the filling ballast tanks with sloshing flow may introduces a difference of not only the ship motion but also the resistance therefore an understanding of the inner sloshing effect is essential to analyze the components of the ship resistance measured in sea trials the motion of the ship equipped with partially filled tanks has been a typical coupling problem for marine hydrodynamics the ship motion induced by incident waves can excite inner sloshing flow to have violent impacts on the tank local region meanwhile inner tanks with a sloshing flow can reduce or increase the ship motion and resistance depending on the filling condition this coupling problem has been mainly encountered in the motion reduction topics such as anti rolling tank whereas the motivation of current work is originated from the sea trials in the previous decades several studies have been conducted to understand the coupling effect between the marine unit and the inner tanks the majority of the early studies are based on potential based analysis or experimental observations including the work of kim 2002 rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 malenica et al 2003 newman 2005 lee et al 2007 molin et al 2008 conducted an experiment to observe the roll response of a rectangular barge supporting two partially filled tanks under irregular beam waves their study discussed the nonlinear effect and tank roof interference under different sea states nam et al 2009 conducted a series of experiments for lng fpso floating production storage offloading unit with two tanks in regular waves the experiment presented a significant coupling effect on both ship motion and sloshing flows and the nonlinear behavior of inner sloshing flow was also discussed with respect to incident wave amplitudes kim et al 2011 studied this coupling problem by experimental measurement and potential based method they adopted a linear sloshing analysis method and the sufficient validation shows that the low filling condition can induce a strong resonance but the coupling effect is not drastic in the past decade there were also several joint industry programs for systematically understanding the coupling effect between ship seakeeping and internal liquid motion while the relevant works are not fully published huang et al 2018 adopted a nonlinear potential based method in which a nonlinear sloshing free surface condition is considered to solve the two dimensional sloshing coupled ship motion in large regular and irregular beam sea one of their discussions is about the wet surface effect under the coupling motion kristiansen et al 2018 studied the seakeeping behavior of a floating fish cage equipped with sloshing tanks including an investigation of possible experimental errors by repeatedly testing the resonant case in which the wave period is around the natural period of sloshing the author addressed the possible bias errors caused by the instability of long propagating waves or the filling accuracy of sloshing water as the computational capacity is significantly growing the volume of fraction vof based cfd method and the smooth particle method sph have been widely used to simulate a highly violent sloshing flow some typical cfd works about the sloshing coupled ship problem include nam et al 2009 li et al 2012 bai et al 2015 ghamari et al 2017 lyu et al 2019 etc with a high resolute numerical model and powerful computational resources the cfd model can provide an acceptable prediction for the violent sloshing flow however the cfd computation will be inefficient if the main interest of computation is dominated by inviscid flow or linear phenomenon for the sloshing coupled effect on ship forward motion seo and kim 2017 applied a three dimensional rankine panel method and a linearized boundary condition for a blunt modified wigley model with two inner tanks their study indicates that the sloshing coupling effect can be heavily induced by restraining ship surge motion especially near the tank resonance region li et al 2019 considered a nonlinear method to solve the sloshing coupled ship forward motion at different forward speeds they concluded that inner sloshing has a limited effect on ship pitch motion because of the phase difference between the sloshing induced moment and the wave induced moment and the coupling effect tends to be significant as forward speed increases zhu et al 2020 conducted a series of experiments to observe the ship forward motion and added resistance coupled with the inner tanks of varying filling conditions it has introduced the fundamental conditions for the experimental work involved in present work the objective of this study is to observe the sloshing coupling effect on ship added resistance and to validate the results using both experimental measurement and numerical computation the blunt modified wigley equipped with two inner tanks is selected to observe the coupling effect at the ship froude number of 0 2 different tank filling heights 0 3h t 0 5h t 0 7h t where h t is the tank height are examined and three ship degree of freedom motions and resistance are observed during the ship motion in waves ship mean sinkage and mean trim are also observed to understand their contributions to ship total resistance to consider the real ocean environment the experiment results from regular wave tests are extended to irregular wave conditions by using a linear spectrum method for validation numerical analysis is performed by using a time domain rankine panel method program named wish wave induced loads and ship motion analysis which is developed by seoul national university based on the linear potential theory linearized boundary value problems are defined for the seakeeping and internal sloshing flow analysis 6 dof motion equations are solved with the linear hydrodynamic force and moment induced by internal sloshing flow to evaluate the second order added resistance induced by an incoming wave and sloshing flow the direct pressure integration method is applied under a reasonable agreement both experimental measurement and numerical analysis have revealed how the inner filling conditions affect the coupling phenomenon generally the ship forward motion is insensitive to inner flow one particular case is found at the medium filling condition that the strong resonant sloshing flow can restrain ship pitch motion as well as ship resistance 2 preparation 2 1 experiment model and test conditions the blunt modified wigley suggested by kashiwagi 2013 which is a mathematical hull of fore aft symmetry is considered in this study to analyze the sloshing coupled effect on ship motion and resistance the ship model has a dimension of 3000 600 400 length beam draft unit mm and it is equipped with two identical prismatic tanks that are symmetrically distributed in the proximity of midship section as shown in fig 1 the longitudinal center of mass locates at the midship additionally this mathematical ship model will be virtually scaled to 240 m in order to estimate the added resistance in irregular waves the prismatic inner tank has a dimension of 600 408 300 length breadth height unit mm and its longitudinal center is located 525 mm distant from the midship section details of the tank geometry can be found in fig 2 three tank filling heights are considered for a comprehensive investigation of the sloshing effect table 1 summarizes the main model particulars with respect to varying tank filling heights the rigid structure of hull always remains the same mass thus the different draft values in table 1 are only caused by the tank filling conditions to measure the model static data such as the center of gravity and gyrational radius inclining test and swing test are performed based on the without sloshing condition in which two inner tanks are replaced by equally distributed counterweights the without sloshing condition is also used for added resistance tests in order to compare with the sloshing condition table 1 shows the same longitudinal gyrational radius k yy under different inner filling conditions it is because the k yy of bare rigid structure is located inside the region where the tanks are installed besides a small longitudinal gyrational radius k yy 0 2 is found for current test model the reason is that the hull has limited inner space so that the prismatic tanks cannot be installed further away from the midship standing wave theory is used to calculate the natural frequency of inner tank as shown in eq 1 where h is the tank filling height and l t is the tank length only the first mode is considered because the sloshing induced force and moment are mainly linear 1 ω 0 g π tanh π h l t l t froude number of 0 2 is used in this study because this number is widely used by those previous added resistance works that have selected the blunt modified wigley as test model kashiwagi 2013 seo and kim 2017 lee 2018 it is a future plan to observe the effect of froude number but it is not involved in this study a fix wave height of 0 008l is selected for the regular wave tests and the wavelength varies from 0 3l to 2 0l table 2 provides the overview of test conditions 2 2 experimental facility and measurement system this series of experiments is performed at the towing tank of seoul national university the towing tank is 110 m long 8 m wide and 3 5 m deep and the towing carriage has a maximum towing speed of 4 5 m s the wave generation system consists of eight constant wedge plungers and it is capable of creating regular waves of 5 400 mm in height and up to 20 m in length the damping beach is installed at the end side of towing tank and controllable wave absorbers are equipped at the dual sides a sonar type wave probe attached to the towing carriage is installed at about 6 m ahead of the midship this distance is considered to be sufficient to ignore the ship disturbed waves with respect to engineering current experiments only involve the linear waves of small amplitude because the ocean environment for sea trials is mainly calm water or a very mild wave field such small amplitude waves can be contaminated by the 1st mode standing wave of entire towing tank which is caused by either a long experimental time or a short rest interval between every runs thus it is necessary to ensure that the surface stillness of towing tank is less than 0 4 mm the minimum limit of the wave probe before running a test the relative error of generated wave amplitude is controlled to be less than 20 fig 3 presents a typical signal about the measured wave elevation where t e is wave encounter period a is the input wave amplitude and η measure is the free surface elevation measured by probe it presents an acceptable wave quality without significant dissipation or modulation in addition the present experiment takes 20 25 min to be the rest interval between each runs ittc 2011 a 3 degree of freedom dof motion measurement system is used for both towing the model and monitoring data as shown in fig 4 the system comprises the towing carriage heave rod pitch free gimbal and load cell the towing carriage contains two soft springs which are used to weakly constrain ship surge motion although the surge motion has neither a significant restoring contribution nor a strong coupling effect with ship heave or pitch motion spring stiffness of 380 n m is carefully determined for no interference with the ship surge frequency detailed information on the soft spring can be found in lee et al 2017 the surge fixed towing condition is not considered in this study because the inner sloshing tanks generate a significant force of inertia that would damage the captive structure a strain gage type load cell is installed between the heave rod and the pitch free gimbal and the measured resistance is of global x direction for all cases the maximum force value does not exceed the measuring limit including the acceleration and deceleration sections to understand the flow motion inside sloshing tanks the capacitive probes cp that measure the sloshing run up are attached onto the tank front and back walls there are 4 groups of capacitive probes numbered from 1 to 4 as indicated in fig 4 two inner tanks have almost identical flow behavior during ship motion thus only the sloshing run up value h 1 measured by 1 cp is selected for result analysis daq is performed using the hbm mx840a device which is a universal amplifier with 24 bit resolution the data sampling rate is 200 hz with a 5 hz low pass filter and all sensors and probes potentiometers for degree of freedom motions wave probe load cell and cps are calibrated independently before running the towing carriage a time window of 12t e 18t e is used for result analysis the added resistance r aw is obtained by subtracting the still water resistance r 0 from the time averaged total resistance of the waves r t namely r aw r t r 0 2 3 evaluation of experiment uncertainty all the measured data contains certain levels of uncertainty due to experimental bias and precision errors and these errors might be amplified by the violent inner sloshing thus it is necessary to examine the uncertainties according to the ittc recommended procedures and guidelines ittc 2008 which is based on iso s methodology 1995 experimental uncertainty can be classified into three categories standard combined and expanded standard uncertainty can be further divided into type a and type b depending on the method of evaluation type a uncertainty is determined using statistical analysis of repeat observations whereas type b uncertainty is evaluated by a wide range of information other than repeat observations the wide range of information includes previous measurements past experience general knowledge and calibration data previous work park et al 2015 already carried out a comprehensive investigation into the experimental uncertainty using the same towing tank facility and measurement equipment as current experiment thus present study only estimates the average values of measured items and their corresponding type a uncertainties through n times of repeat observations the measured item q includes incident wave properties ship motion and ship resistance the average value for each item q is given by 2 q 1 n k 1 n q k where q k is the measured value at kth repeat test the type a uncertainty u q is estimated by the following equations where s is the standard deviation 3 s 2 1 n 1 k 1 n q k q 2 4 u q s n the repeat tests are based on the 0 5h t tank filling condition three typical wavelength conditions 0 5l 1 0l 1 8l that cover from short wave to long wave are selected and wave height remains constant 0 008l 10 repeats are performed for each wavelength condition the 1 0l wavelength case is a special case that can quantify the uncertainty under a strong sloshing coupling effect because the wave encounter frequency meets the natural frequency of inner tanks during the experiment test data is discarded if the wave probe shows the unsatisfied incoming waves that the amplitude error a measure a a is larger than 20 where a measure is the measured wave amplitude and a is the input wave amplitude fig 5 presents the motion transfer functions and added resistance obtained through repeat tests and table 3 summarizes the mean values and type a uncertainties variables k a λ are wave number wave amplitude and incident wavelength respectively ξ 1 ξ 3 ξ 5 are the 1st order amplitude of ship surge heave and pitch motion b is ship width and l is ship length r 0 is the ship resistance measured in calm water while r t is the ship total resistance measured in waves fig 5 a shows relatively large surge uncertainty for the 1 0l wavelength case in which strong harmonic sloshing is induced as previously mentioned surge motion provides a negligible restoring effect and a very weak coupling effect with ship heave and pitch thus the sloshing induced surge uncertainty has no significant effect on other motion responses and resistance 3 numerical method 3 1 boundary value problem 3 1 1 seakeeping analysis in this study the ship seakeeping problem is investigated using a time domain three dimensional rankine panel method this method is basically the same as that of seo and kim 2017 and only a few changes have been made for the seakeeping and the sloshing analysis fig 6 shows the coordinate system and solution grids applied by current method starting with the assumption of an incompressible inviscid and irrotational flow the velocity potential can be introduced and the boundary value problem is formulated

relative steady velocity induced by the ship rotational motion there are two important reasons to introduce the body fixed coordinate system for this study first a body boundary condition does not include second order derivatives of the steady flow induced basis potential shao and faltinsen 2012 second it is useful to perform coupling analysis with the internal sloshing flow which will be defined with respect to the tank fixed coordinate system a detailed mathematical interpretation regarding the current body fixed coordinate system can be found in lee and kim 2020 green s second identity is introduced to solve the derived boundary value problem 14 φ d s b φ d g n d s s f φ d n g d s s b g φ d n d s s f φ d g n d s in the present method the rankine source is distributed on the discretized free surface and the rigid body panel which means φ d and φ d n indicate the strength of the normal dipole and point source then the above boundary integral equations can be converted into an algebraic matrix equation details regarding the present rankine panel method can be found in kim et al 2011 3 1 2 sloshing analysis as stated in many studies the internal sloshing flow is a highly nonlinear phenomenon accompanying a local impact occurrence jet flow and so on however the global ship motion and resistance are not significantly affected by such local flows kim et al 2007 observing the ship motion and global resistance is the main concern of current work thus the introduction of a linear potential theory can be an appropriate strategy to derive a boundary value problem for the internal flow a tank fixed coordinate system is introduced in the following formulation the subscript s indicates the physical components defined with respect to the tank fixed coordinate system o s x

and the wave elevation induced by the internal sloshing flow respectively it should be noted that there are several additional terms in the kinematic free surface boundary condition first δ 3 ξ 3 y ξ 4 x ξ 5 indicates a vertical velocity of the inner tank free surface induced by ship motion this term is introduced in the process of the coordinate transformation from space fixed to tank fixed known as the galilean transformation physically due to this galilean transformation ζ s t relatively elevates with respect to the tank fixed coordinate system faltinsen and timokha 2009 second δ s 3 y s ξ 4 x s ξ 5 denotes an inclination of the inner tank mean free surface with respect to the center of inner tank water plane area o s by including this component the mean free surface of the inner tank is always parallel to the external free surface malenica et al 2003 and the definition of the mean free surface of inner tank can be found in fig 7 the final term of the kinematic free surface boundary condition is introduced to impose artificial damping on the inner tank free surface similar to kim et al 2019 the derived boundary value problem is solved using green s second identity which is identical to the previous seakeeping analysis 3 2 ship motion analysis 3 2 1 equations of motion ship motion responses induced by the incoming wave is calculated by 6 dof equations of motion 19 m i j

hydrodynamic forces c i j sloshing f sloshing i are imposed into the existing equations of motion 3 2 2 restoring coefficient matrix restoring coefficients from the external fluid are derived by the integration of the hydrostatic pressure along the mean wet surface which is the classical linear coefficient used in most seakeeping analyses however the derivation of additional restoring coefficients induced by the inner tank hydrostatic pressure is slightly different two significant aspects should be considered first the relative vertical position of the inner tank means that the free surface will not change with the vertical motion of the ship despite its ability to rotate second the center of gravity and buoyancy of the inner tank coincide with each other from the aforementioned discussion the hydrostatic coefficients from the inner tank fluid can be derived as shown in eq 18 s i j indicates the second moment of the area for the inner tank free surface with respect to the center of the waterplane area o s note there are only pitch roll related components which have opposite signs with respect to the restoring coefficients from the external fluid the

thus it should be excluded by removing the last term in f sloshing to avoid the double count of the inner tank fluid inertia 3 2 4 coordinate transformation as previously mentioned the hydrostatic coefficients and the hydrodynamic force induced by the inner tank sloshing flow are formulated with respect to the tank fixed coordinate system the overall equations of the ship motion are solved with respect to the ship fixed coordinate system thus additional force components considering the sloshing flow have to be converted 24 f ship fixed f tank fixed 25 m ship fixed m tank fxied r o r o s f tank fixed according to eqs 22 and 23 the hydrostatic coefficients from the inner tank fluid would be the same in a ship fixed coordinate system however the hydrodynamic moment would change corresponding to the distance between the origins of the two coordinate systems 3 3 prediction of added resistance the direct pressure integration method is applied to evaluate the added resistance the formulation can be derived by the integration of second order perturbed variables including pressure normal vector and so on 26 f ar ship i i i i i i i v where i ρ g 2 w l ζ δ 3 2 n 0 sin α d l ρ

current near field method can be found in lee and kim 2020 4 results and analysis 4 1 results in calm water prior to considering incident waves a series of towing tests in calm water condition is conducted to observe the inner sloshing effect table 4 has summarized the results of calm water tests the virtually scaled model 240 m in table 4 indicates the predicted results for the model that has been virtually scaled to 240 m and those results will be used in later section 4 2 4 for irregular wave analysis the variables τ and σ represent ship sinkage and ship trim respectively r 0 m and r 0 s are the calm water resistances for the model ship and the virtually scaled ship c t is total drag coefficient and c f is frictional drag coefficient the froude hypothesis is used to predict the r 0 s and the c f is calculated by the ittc line as follows c f 0 075 log 10 re 2 2 for each filling condition listed in table 4 different trim values are observed between the sloshing case and the without sloshing case to identify the reason fig 8 has compared the measurement signals of ship sinkage trim and h 1 at the initial towing stage δh 1 is the inner sloshing run up measured by the 1 capacitive probe cp the signals can be divided into three stages 1 2 3 as marked in fig 8 b at the stage 1 ship accelerates and the absolute trim angle increases bow up and h 1 becomes negative due to the inertia effect of filling water then at the stage 2 the inertia effect of filling water starts to restrain the increasing tendency of ship trim and the trim is further reduced at the stage 3 despite the inertial effect of filling water the changed ship trim attitude has no significant effect on ship sinkage and wet surface because current model has symmetrical geometry that is why the ship sinkage and resistance are still similar regardless of the sloshing conditions a merchant hull with no fore aft symmetry may have different steady resistances because of inner tanks 4 2 results in regular waves in this section the computational results and experimental data are compared and their differences are observed to understand the sloshing coupled effect on ship added resistance following the test matrix of table 2 the natural frequencies of the inner tank are 4 750 rad s λ 1 71l at the 0 3h t filling condition 5 804 rad s λ 1 21l at the 0 5h t filling condition and 6 412 rad s λ 1 08l at the 0 7h t filling condition it should be noted that some of the experimental data are from the results of zhu et al 2020 4 2 1 inner flow motion and ship surge fig 9 can be used to understand the inner flow motion under different incident waves the variable h 1 a is the 1st order amplitude of the periodical run up of inner free surface which is obtained by discrete fourier transform as shown in the figures inner sloshing is induced only when the wave encounter frequency becomes close to the natural frequency of inner tanks when the wave encounter frequency is distant from the tank s natural frequency the inner free surface remains very calm even the ship is undergoing wave induced motions different from the other two filling levels the 0 3h t filling case has a very mild sloshing flow at its resonance point it is caused by the phase and the detail explanation is given at the end of this section as shown in fig 9 b and c the 0 5h t filling case has the strongest sloshing free surface near resonance zone while the 0 7h t filling case has a relatively smaller sloshing tendency the reason is that higher filling tanks require more external energy to excite sloshing fig 9 also contains the wish results which have a similar tendency as the experimental measurements at the resonance region wish provides underestimated peak values mostly due to the limitation of linear theory the nonlinear or violent free surface can be simulated by using cfd solver but the violent free surface is beyond the interest of current study fig 10 12 present the sequential development of inner sloshing including wish post analysis and experimental snapshots very mild sloshing flow is observed from the 0 3h t filling case while strong sloshing flows are captured for the other two filling cases fig 12 also observes an interference between the sloshing free surface and tank roof the roof interference can affect local sloshing phenomena such as local impact and airgap but it gives an insignificant contribution to the sloshing induced force which is dominated by the inertia of entire filling water fig 13 presents ship surge motion and surge phase under incident waves the phase is defined with respect to the instant when the crest of incident wave is at midship the interesting phenomenon is that 0 3h t filling case has restrained ship surge response but the other two filling cases have significantly increased ship surge response these different surge behaviors are caused by the inertia effect of filling tank the low filling tanks have relatively small inertia because the volume of filling water is small compared with ship total displacement thus it turns the tanks to the anti surge tanks which have a similar function as anti rolling tank the restrained surge behavior of low filling tanks can also be understood through the phase difference between h 1 a and ship surge motion as given in fig 14 at the near resonance region where ship surge is restrained the phase difference between sloshing free surface h 1 a and ship surge reaches to nearly 90 additionally a certain discrepancy between experimental data and numerical results is found in fig 13 a this is very likely due to the limitation of linear theory in shallow filling conditions 4 2 2 ship heave and pitch responses fig 15 17 show the external wave patterns and the inner free surface shapes it cannot be shown in present study but it was observed that the wave patterns are very similar between numerical computation and experiment for the ship motion results given in fig 18 and 19 both the experimental data and the numerical results indicate that ship heave and pitch motions are insensitive to the sloshing effect except for one special case for which the filling level is 0 5h t and the wavelength λ l is 1 0 it must be stated that current symmetric hull has a weak heave pitch coupling effect for a real ship model the inner sloshing can be expected to change the ship heave motion and pitch motion at the same time fig 20 is the phase difference between h 1 a and the ship pitch response and it can be observed that the phase difference shifts to 180 when wave encounter frequency is close to tank natural frequency it indicates that the ship pitch response can be restrained as long as the sloshing induced force and moment become significant the coupling effect on ship pitch motion can also be explained in the viewpoint of model mass distribution because the moving ship in fact has a dynamic mass distribution which is caused by the inner sloshing fluid the sloshing fluid can change both the center of body mass and the moment of body inertia thus it indirectly affects the ship pitch behavior 4 2 3 mean motion and total resistance although the incident wave induces ship to have oscillatory motions and added resistance the tank inertia effect can still affect the ship mean attitude or the mean wet surface which determines an important part of ship total resistance fig 21 presents the ship mean positions and the total resistance coefficient c t it can be observed that the sloshing effect causes a smaller mean trim value compared with that of no sloshing case as explained in section 4 1 this sloshing effect occurs at the initial towing stage when ship does not meet incoming waves in addition the 0 5h t filling case shows a dropped resistance value at λ l 1 0 condition this drop is actually the reduced added resistance which will be revisited in the next section 4 2 4 added resistance fig 22 provides the added resistance results with respect to different filling conditions and varying incident wavelengths the added resistance data is found to be more scattering at the low filling condition it is because the ship with low filling condition has the small draft condition and small resistance that result in an increased ratio between the sensor noise and the resistance data at short wave regions linear potential theory still has limitations so that it provides the underestimated results comparing with experimental data when a ship moves forward in short waves mainly the diffraction waves that have nonlinear characteristics are generated near ship bow and this nonlinear phenomenon requires a further work for linear potential based method besides although the current ship model is a blunt body its slenderness or block coefficient is actually reduced as lowering the filling levels or draft condition the reduced slenderness causes another challenge for the present numerical computations similar to ship pitch motion added resistance is generally not sensitive to the sloshing effect except for one special case that a dropped data is found in fig 22 b section 2 3 has already confirmed that the resistance drop is not caused by any possible experimental uncertainties thus the reduced added resistance corresponds sufficiently with the restrained ship pitch motion moreover the drop can also be explained through the relative wave elevation along ship surface because the waterline integration of the relative wave elevation is an important component of ship added resistance as indicated by eq 26 fig 23 provides the wish analysis on the amplitude of the relative wave elevation along ship surface a is the input wave amplitude ζ is wave elevation δ is ship vertical motion from fig 23 b the sloshing case is observed to have a significantly decreased result 4 3 results in irregular waves considering the real ocean environment for sea trial it is necessary to estimate the sloshing coupling effect on the ship added resistance in irregular waves based on wave spectrum s ω and the transfer function r ω of regular waves the added resistance in irregular waves r irr can be estimated through the linear spectrum method as follows 29 r i r r 2 r ω a 2 s ω d ω since that most sea trials are performed at mild sea conditions the pierson moskowitz spectrum with sea states 2 3 4 is applied for analysis in these mild sea states the energy of wave spectrum mainly comes from short wave regions which means that the transfer function r ω of regular short waves has more contributions to r irr fig 24 presents the r irr as the ratio of calm water resistance r 0 although accumulated experimental uncertainties can exist sloshing cases generally show slightly smaller values comparing with no sloshing cases indicating that the sloshing effect reduces wave added resistance fig 24 also shows that the 0 3h t filling case provides higher added resistances than that of the other two filling cases it is because the 0 3h t filling condition has higher added resistance in regular short waves moreover an obvious difference can be observed for the sea state 4 in fig 24 b the difference is caused by the strong sloshing coupling effect at the resonant condition which has been widely discussed in previous sections however the reduction or increase of resistance is dependent on the ship and many factors such as hull form loading condition filling condition and wave condition therefore the present results cannot be interpreted as a general case 5 conclusions in this study a mathematical hull with two internal tanks is used to observe the inner sloshing effect on its forward motion in calm water regular head waves and irregular waves the observation is based on both experimental measurement and the time domain rankine panel method and a sufficient agreement has been found the coupling between the wave induced ship motions and the inner sloshing flow has been examined with different filling ratios and the following conclusions can be drawn for the present ship model and test conditions the calm water tests show that ship trim can be slightly restrained due to the large inertia of inner tanks the reduced trim condition does not significantly change ship wet surface as well as resistance because current test model is a fore aft symmetrical body however a real ship may experience a different resistance caused by internal heavy tanks for regular wave tests a noticeable inner sloshing flow is induced only when the wave encounter frequency becomes close to the natural frequency of inner tanks the inner sloshing flow is apparent through the ship surge response which differs depending on the tank filling ratios a low filling ratio can restrain the ship surge motion while a medium or high filling ratio significantly induces the ship surge response at the tank resonance region this phenomenon is due to the inertia effect of internal tanks the most violent sloshing flow is observed in medium filling tanks 0 5h t filling during the resonant sloshing the violent sloshing flow has a 180 phase difference with ship pitch motion it thus reduces the pitch responses as well as the relative wave elevation along ship which causes a significant drop of added resistance the reduced added resistance has been observed in both regular waves and irregular waves however except for the resonant case at medium filling ratio the inner sloshing flow is generally insensitive to ship heave pitch and resistance the linear potential based method which applies rankine panel method and linearized boundary value problem for both seakeeping and internal sloshing analysis has provided very reasonable results that agree sufficiently with experimental measurements therefore it can be used to predict the sloshing effect of ballast water in sea trials credit authorship contribution statement zhang zhu experiment computation formal

20602,most sea trials of large merchant ships are carried out with the filling ballast water in cargo and the trial environment may involve mild waves as well it causes the ship to undergo a coupling effect between external wave excitation and internal sloshing motion and an understanding of such coupling is important to analyze the components of the total resistance measured in sea trials in this study a blunt modified wigley equipped with two inner tanks is selected to observe its hydrodynamic responses under head waves using both experimental measurement and numerical computations ship is considered to have a forward motion at the froude number of 0 2 and three filling conditions varying from low filling to high filling have been arranged for two inner tanks for validation numerical computation is performed based on the three dimensional rankine panel method with the linearized boundary value problems both seakeeping and internal sloshing flow are analyzed using the linear potential theory the validation presents a sufficient agreement between experimental measurement and numerical results with or without the sloshing effect and both two methods have shown that the sloshing coupling effect is generally insignificant for present ship model however when the wave encounter frequency becomes very close to the tank natural frequency the medium filling tanks generate a strong coupling effect which can restrain ship motion responses as well as added resistance keywords sloshing coupled effect sea trial added resistance 1 introduction to conduct ship sea trials filling ballast water is typically used to fit the design load waterline which means a different condition compared with the ship of solid cargo such as bulk carrier or container ship considering the real sea trial environment that involves mild waves and other natural conditions the filling ballast tanks with sloshing flow may introduces a difference of not only the ship motion but also the resistance therefore an understanding of the inner sloshing effect is essential to analyze the components of the ship resistance measured in sea trials the motion of the ship equipped with partially filled tanks has been a typical coupling problem for marine hydrodynamics the ship motion induced by incident waves can excite inner sloshing flow to have violent impacts on the tank local region meanwhile inner tanks with a sloshing flow can reduce or increase the ship motion and resistance depending on the filling condition this coupling problem has been mainly encountered in the motion reduction topics such as anti rolling tank whereas the motivation of current work is originated from the sea trials in the previous decades several studies have been conducted to understand the coupling effect between the marine unit and the inner tanks the majority of the early studies are based on potential based analysis or experimental observations including the work of kim 2002 rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 malenica et al 2003 newman 2005 lee et al 2007 molin et al 2008 conducted an experiment to observe the roll response of a rectangular barge supporting two partially filled tanks under irregular beam waves their study discussed the nonlinear effect and tank roof interference under different sea states nam et al 2009 conducted a series of experiments for lng fpso floating production storage offloading unit with two tanks in regular waves the experiment presented a significant coupling effect on both ship motion and sloshing flows and the nonlinear behavior of inner sloshing flow was also discussed with respect to incident wave amplitudes kim et al 2011 studied this coupling problem by experimental measurement and potential based method they adopted a linear sloshing analysis method and the sufficient validation shows that the low filling condition can induce a strong resonance but the coupling effect is not drastic in the past decade there were also several joint industry programs for systematically understanding the coupling effect between ship seakeeping and internal liquid motion while the relevant works are not fully published huang et al 2018 adopted a nonlinear potential based method in which a nonlinear sloshing free surface condition is considered to solve the two dimensional sloshing coupled ship motion in large regular and irregular beam sea one of their discussions is about the wet surface effect under the coupling motion kristiansen et al 2018 studied the seakeeping behavior of a floating fish cage equipped with sloshing tanks including an investigation of possible experimental errors by repeatedly testing the resonant case in which the wave period is around the natural period of sloshing the author addressed the possible bias errors caused by the instability of long propagating waves or the filling accuracy of sloshing water as the computational capacity is significantly growing the volume of fraction vof based cfd method and the smooth particle method sph have been widely used to simulate a highly violent sloshing flow some typical cfd works about the sloshing coupled ship problem include nam et al 2009 li et al 2012 bai et al 2015 ghamari et al 2017 lyu et al 2019 etc with a high resolute numerical model and powerful computational resources the cfd model can provide an acceptable prediction for the violent sloshing flow however the cfd computation will be inefficient if the main interest of computation is dominated by inviscid flow or linear phenomenon for the sloshing coupled effect on ship forward motion seo and kim 2017 applied a three dimensional rankine panel method and a linearized boundary condition for a blunt modified wigley model with two inner tanks their study indicates that the sloshing coupling effect can be heavily induced by restraining ship surge motion especially near the tank resonance region li et al 2019 considered a nonlinear method to solve the sloshing coupled ship forward motion at different forward speeds they concluded that inner sloshing has a limited effect on ship pitch motion because of the phase difference between the sloshing induced moment and the wave induced moment and the coupling effect tends to be significant as forward speed increases zhu et al 2020 conducted a series of experiments to observe the ship forward motion and added resistance coupled with the inner tanks of varying filling conditions it has introduced the fundamental conditions for the experimental work involved in present work the objective of this study is to observe the sloshing coupling effect on ship added resistance and to validate the results using both experimental measurement and numerical computation the blunt modified wigley equipped with two inner tanks is selected to observe the coupling effect at the ship froude number of 0 2 different tank filling heights 0 3h t 0 5h t 0 7h t where h t is the tank height are examined and three ship degree of freedom motions and resistance are observed during the ship motion in waves ship mean sinkage and mean trim are also observed to understand their contributions to ship total resistance to consider the real ocean environment the experiment results from regular wave tests are extended to irregular wave conditions by using a linear spectrum method for validation numerical analysis is performed by using a time domain rankine panel method program named wish wave induced loads and ship motion analysis which is developed by seoul national university based on the linear potential theory linearized boundary value problems are defined for the seakeeping and internal sloshing flow analysis 6 dof motion equations are solved with the linear hydrodynamic force and moment induced by internal sloshing flow to evaluate the second order added resistance induced by an incoming wave and sloshing flow the direct pressure integration method is applied under a reasonable agreement both experimental measurement and numerical analysis have revealed how the inner filling conditions affect the coupling phenomenon generally the ship forward motion is insensitive to inner flow one particular case is found at the medium filling condition that the strong resonant sloshing flow can restrain ship pitch motion as well as ship resistance 2 preparation 2 1 experiment model and test conditions the blunt modified wigley suggested by kashiwagi 2013 which is a mathematical hull of fore aft symmetry is considered in this study to analyze the sloshing coupled effect on ship motion and resistance the ship model has a dimension of 3000 600 400 length beam draft unit mm and it is equipped with two identical prismatic tanks that are symmetrically distributed in the proximity of midship section as shown in fig 1 the longitudinal center of mass locates at the midship additionally this mathematical ship model will be virtually scaled to 240 m in order to estimate the added resistance in irregular waves the prismatic inner tank has a dimension of 600 408 300 length breadth height unit mm and its longitudinal center is located 525 mm distant from the midship section details of the tank geometry can be found in fig 2 three tank filling heights are considered for a comprehensive investigation of the sloshing effect table 1 summarizes the main model particulars with respect to varying tank filling heights the rigid structure of hull always remains the same mass thus the different draft values in table 1 are only caused by the tank filling conditions to measure the model static data such as the center of gravity and gyrational radius inclining test and swing test are performed based on the without sloshing condition in which two inner tanks are replaced by equally distributed counterweights the without sloshing condition is also used for added resistance tests in order to compare with the sloshing condition table 1 shows the same longitudinal gyrational radius k yy under different inner filling conditions it is because the k yy of bare rigid structure is located inside the region where the tanks are installed besides a small longitudinal gyrational radius k yy 0 2 is found for current test model the reason is that the hull has limited inner space so that the prismatic tanks cannot be installed further away from the midship standing wave theory is used to calculate the natural frequency of inner tank as shown in eq 1 where h is the tank filling height and l t is the tank length only the first mode is considered because the sloshing induced force and moment are mainly linear 1 ω 0 g π tanh π h l t l t froude number of 0 2 is used in this study because this number is widely used by those previous added resistance works that have selected the blunt modified wigley as test model kashiwagi 2013 seo and kim 2017 lee 2018 it is a future plan to observe the effect of froude number but it is not involved in this study a fix wave height of 0 008l is selected for the regular wave tests and the wavelength varies from 0 3l to 2 0l table 2 provides the overview of test conditions 2 2 experimental facility and measurement system this series of experiments is performed at the towing tank of seoul national university the towing tank is 110 m long 8 m wide and 3 5 m deep and the towing carriage has a maximum towing speed of 4 5 m s the wave generation system consists of eight constant wedge plungers and it is capable of creating regular waves of 5 400 mm in height and up to 20 m in length the damping beach is installed at the end side of towing tank and controllable wave absorbers are equipped at the dual sides a sonar type wave probe attached to the towing carriage is installed at about 6 m ahead of the midship this distance is considered to be sufficient to ignore the ship disturbed waves with respect to engineering current experiments only involve the linear waves of small amplitude because the ocean environment for sea trials is mainly calm water or a very mild wave field such small amplitude waves can be contaminated by the 1st mode standing wave of entire towing tank which is caused by either a long experimental time or a short rest interval between every runs thus it is necessary to ensure that the surface stillness of towing tank is less than 0 4 mm the minimum limit of the wave probe before running a test the relative error of generated wave amplitude is controlled to be less than 20 fig 3 presents a typical signal about the measured wave elevation where t e is wave encounter period a is the input wave amplitude and η measure is the free surface elevation measured by probe it presents an acceptable wave quality without significant dissipation or modulation in addition the present experiment takes 20 25 min to be the rest interval between each runs ittc 2011 a 3 degree of freedom dof motion measurement system is used for both towing the model and monitoring data as shown in fig 4 the system comprises the towing carriage heave rod pitch free gimbal and load cell the towing carriage contains two soft springs which are used to weakly constrain ship surge motion although the surge motion has neither a significant restoring contribution nor a strong coupling effect with ship heave or pitch motion spring stiffness of 380 n m is carefully determined for no interference with the ship surge frequency detailed information on the soft spring can be found in lee et al 2017 the surge fixed towing condition is not considered in this study because the inner sloshing tanks generate a significant force of inertia that would damage the captive structure a strain gage type load cell is installed between the heave rod and the pitch free gimbal and the measured resistance is of global x direction for all cases the maximum force value does not exceed the measuring limit including the acceleration and deceleration sections to understand the flow motion inside sloshing tanks the capacitive probes cp that measure the sloshing run up are attached onto the tank front and back walls there are 4 groups of capacitive probes numbered from 1 to 4 as indicated in fig 4 two inner tanks have almost identical flow behavior during ship motion thus only the sloshing run up value h 1 measured by 1 cp is selected for result analysis daq is performed using the hbm mx840a device which is a universal amplifier with 24 bit resolution the data sampling rate is 200 hz with a 5 hz low pass filter and all sensors and probes potentiometers for degree of freedom motions wave probe load cell and cps are calibrated independently before running the towing carriage a time window of 12t e 18t e is used for result analysis the added resistance r aw is obtained by subtracting the still water resistance r 0 from the time averaged total resistance of the waves r t namely r aw r t r 0 2 3 evaluation of experiment uncertainty all the measured data contains certain levels of uncertainty due to experimental bias and precision errors and these errors might be amplified by the violent inner sloshing thus it is necessary to examine the uncertainties according to the ittc recommended procedures and guidelines ittc 2008 which is based on iso s methodology 1995 experimental uncertainty can be classified into three categories standard combined and expanded standard uncertainty can be further divided into type a and type b depending on the method of evaluation type a uncertainty is determined using statistical analysis of repeat observations whereas type b uncertainty is evaluated by a wide range of information other than repeat observations the wide range of information includes previous measurements past experience general knowledge and calibration data previous work park et al 2015 already carried out a comprehensive investigation into the experimental uncertainty using the same towing tank facility and measurement equipment as current experiment thus present study only estimates the average values of measured items and their corresponding type a uncertainties through n times of repeat observations the measured item q includes incident wave properties ship motion and ship resistance the average value for each item q is given by 2 q 1 n k 1 n q k where q k is the measured value at kth repeat test the type a uncertainty u q is estimated by the following equations where s is the standard deviation 3 s 2 1 n 1 k 1 n q k q 2 4 u q s n the repeat tests are based on the 0 5h t tank filling condition three typical wavelength conditions 0 5l 1 0l 1 8l that cover from short wave to long wave are selected and wave height remains constant 0 008l 10 repeats are performed for each wavelength condition the 1 0l wavelength case is a special case that can quantify the uncertainty under a strong sloshing coupling effect because the wave encounter frequency meets the natural frequency of inner tanks during the experiment test data is discarded if the wave probe shows the unsatisfied incoming waves that the amplitude error a measure a a is larger than 20 where a measure is the measured wave amplitude and a is the input wave amplitude fig 5 presents the motion transfer functions and added resistance obtained through repeat tests and table 3 summarizes the mean values and type a uncertainties variables k a λ are wave number wave amplitude and incident wavelength respectively ξ 1 ξ 3 ξ 5 are the 1st order amplitude of ship surge heave and pitch motion b is ship width and l is ship length r 0 is the ship resistance measured in calm water while r t is the ship total resistance measured in waves fig 5 a shows relatively large surge uncertainty for the 1 0l wavelength case in which strong harmonic sloshing is induced as previously mentioned surge motion provides a negligible restoring effect and a very weak coupling effect with ship heave and pitch thus the sloshing induced surge uncertainty has no significant effect on other motion responses and resistance 3 numerical method 3 1 boundary value problem 3 1 1 seakeeping analysis in this study the ship seakeeping problem is investigated using a time domain three dimensional rankine panel method this method is basically the same as that of seo and kim 2017 and only a few changes have been made for the seakeeping and the sloshing analysis fig 6 shows the coordinate system and solution grids applied by current method starting with the assumption of an incompressible inviscid and irrotational flow the velocity potential can be introduced and the boundary value problem is formulated

relative steady velocity induced by the ship rotational motion there are two important reasons to introduce the body fixed coordinate system for this study first a body boundary condition does not include second order derivatives of the steady flow induced basis potential shao and faltinsen 2012 second it is useful to perform coupling analysis with the internal sloshing flow which will be defined with respect to the tank fixed coordinate system a detailed mathematical interpretation regarding the current body fixed coordinate system can be found in lee and kim 2020 green s second

an algebraic matrix equation details regarding the present rankine panel method can be found in kim et al 2011 3 1 2 sloshing analysis as stated in many studies the internal sloshing flow is a highly nonlinear phenomenon accompanying a local impact occurrence jet flow and so on however the global ship motion and resistance are not significantly affected by such local flows kim et al 2007 observing the ship motion and global resistance is the main concern of current work thus the introduction of a linear potential theory can be an appropriate strategy to derive a boundary value problem for the internal flow a tank fixed coordinate system is introduced in the following formulation the subscript s indicates the physical components defined with respect to the tank fixed coordinate system o s x

and the wave elevation induced by the internal sloshing flow respectively it should be noted that there are several additional terms in the kinematic free surface boundary condition first δ 3 ξ 3 y ξ 4 x ξ 5 indicates a vertical velocity of the inner tank free surface induced by ship motion this term is introduced in the process of the coordinate transformation from space fixed to tank fixed known as the galilean transformation physically due to this galilean transformation ζ s t relatively elevates with respect to the tank fixed coordinate system faltinsen and timokha 2009 second δ s 3 y s ξ 4 x s ξ 5 denotes an inclination of the inner tank mean free surface with respect to the center of inner tank water plane area o s by including this component the mean free surface of the inner tank is always parallel to the external free surface malenica et al 2003 and the definition of the mean free surface of inner tank can be found in fig 7 the final term of the kinematic free surface boundary condition is introduced to impose artificial damping on the inner tank free surface similar to kim et al 2019 the derived boundary value problem is solved using green s second identity which is identical to the previous seakeeping analysis 3 2 ship motion analysis 3 2 1 equations of motion ship motion responses induced by the incoming wave is calculated by 6 dof equations of motion 19 m i j ξ j c i j c i j sloshing ξ j f f k i f h d i f sloshing i here m i j denotes the mass matrix of the ship including the inner tank fluid and c i j indicates the hydrostatic restoring coefficients from the external fluid f f k j f h d j are the froude krylov and wave induced hydrodynamic forces respectively to include the coupling effect of the internal sloshing flow additional restoring and hydrodynamic forces c i j sloshing f sloshing i are imposed into the existing equations of motion 3 2 2 restoring coefficient matrix restoring coefficients from the external fluid are derived by the integration of the hydrostatic pressure along the mean wet surface which is the classical linear coefficient used in most seakeeping analyses however the derivation of additional restoring coefficients induced by the inner tank hydrostatic pressure is slightly different two significant aspects should be considered first the relative vertical position of the inner tank means that the free surface will not change with the vertical motion of the ship despite its ability to rotate second the center of gravity and buoyancy of the inner tank coincide with each other from the aforementioned discussion the hydrostatic coefficients from the inner tank fluid can be derived as shown in eq 18 s i j indicates the second moment of the area for the inner tank free surface with respect to the center of the waterplane area o s note there are only pitch roll related components which have opposite signs with respect to the restoring coefficients from the external fluid the detailed mathematical process of the derivation can be found in malencia et al 2003 20 c i j tank ρ g 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 s 44 s 45 0 0 0 0 s 45 s 55 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 2 3 hydrodynamic force and moment hydrodynamic force and moment are calculated by integrating the dynamic pressure along the mean wetted surface area 21 f f k ρ s b φ i t u 0 φ φ i n 0 d s 22 f h d ρ s b

is worth noting that the inertial force and moment induced by the inner tank fluid is included in ρ s b s φ s t n s 0 d s the inertial matrix of the inner tank fluid is already considered in m i j thus it should be excluded by removing the last term in f sloshing to avoid the double count of the inner tank fluid inertia 3 2 4 coordinate transformation as previously mentioned the hydrostatic coefficients and the hydrodynamic force induced by the inner tank sloshing flow are formulated with respect to the tank fixed coordinate system the overall equations of the ship motion are solved with respect to the ship fixed coordinate system thus additional force components considering the sloshing flow have to be converted 24 f ship fixed f tank fixed 25 m ship fixed m tank fxied r o r o s f tank fixed according to eqs 22 and 23 the hydrostatic coefficients from the inner tank fluid would be the same in a ship fixed coordinate system however the hydrodynamic moment would change corresponding to the distance between the origins of the two coordinate systems 3 3 prediction of added resistance the direct pressure integration method is applied to evaluate the added resistance the formulation can be derived by the integration of second order perturbed variables including pressure normal vector and so on 26 f ar ship i i i i i i i v where i ρ g 2 w l ζ δ 3 2 n 0 sin α d l ρ

current near field method can be found in lee and kim 2020 4 results and analysis 4 1 results in calm water prior to considering incident waves a series of towing tests in calm water condition is conducted to observe the inner sloshing effect table 4 has summarized the results of calm water tests the virtually scaled model 240 m in table 4 indicates the predicted results for the model that has been virtually scaled to 240 m and those results will be used in later section 4 2 4 for irregular wave analysis the variables τ and σ represent ship sinkage and ship trim respectively r 0 m and r 0 s are the calm water resistances for the model ship and the virtually scaled ship c t is total drag coefficient and c f is frictional drag coefficient the froude hypothesis is used to predict the r 0 s and the c f is calculated by the ittc line as follows c f 0 075 log 10 re 2 2 for each filling condition listed in table 4 different trim values are observed between the sloshing case and the without sloshing case to identify the reason fig 8 has compared the measurement signals of ship sinkage trim and h 1 at the initial towing stage δh 1 is the inner sloshing run up measured by the 1 capacitive probe cp the signals can be divided into three stages 1 2 3 as marked in fig 8 b at the stage 1 ship accelerates and the absolute trim angle increases bow up and h 1 becomes negative due to the inertia effect of filling water then at the stage 2 the inertia effect of filling water starts to restrain the increasing tendency of ship trim and the trim is further reduced at the stage 3 despite the inertial effect of filling water the changed ship trim attitude has no significant effect on ship sinkage and wet surface because current model has symmetrical geometry that is why the ship sinkage and resistance are still similar regardless of the sloshing conditions a merchant hull with no fore aft symmetry may have different steady resistances because of inner tanks 4 2 results in regular waves in this section the computational results and experimental data are compared and their differences are observed to understand the sloshing coupled effect on ship added resistance following the test matrix of table 2 the natural frequencies of the inner tank are 4 750 rad s λ 1 71l at the 0 3h t filling condition 5 804 rad s λ 1 21l at the 0 5h t filling condition and 6 412 rad s λ 1 08l at the 0 7h t filling condition it should be noted that some of the experimental data are from the results of zhu et al 2020 4 2 1 inner flow motion and ship surge fig 9 can be used to understand the inner flow motion under different incident waves the variable h 1 a is the 1st order amplitude of the periodical run up of inner free surface which is obtained by discrete fourier transform as shown in the figures inner sloshing is induced only when the wave encounter frequency becomes close to the natural frequency of inner tanks when the wave encounter frequency is distant from the tank s natural frequency the inner free surface remains very calm even the ship is undergoing wave induced motions different from the other two filling levels the 0 3h t filling case has a very mild sloshing flow at its resonance point it is caused by the phase and the detail explanation is given at the end of this section as shown in fig 9 b and c the 0 5h t filling case has the strongest sloshing free surface near resonance zone while the 0 7h t filling case has a relatively smaller sloshing tendency the reason is that higher filling tanks require more external energy to excite sloshing fig 9 also contains the wish results which have a similar tendency as the experimental measurements at the resonance region wish provides underestimated peak values mostly due to the limitation of linear theory the nonlinear or violent free surface can be simulated by using cfd solver but the violent free surface is beyond the interest of current study fig 10 12 present the sequential development of inner sloshing including wish post analysis and experimental snapshots very mild sloshing flow is observed from the 0 3h t filling case while strong sloshing flows are captured for the other two filling cases fig 12 also observes an interference between the sloshing free surface and tank roof the roof interference can affect local sloshing phenomena such as local impact and airgap but it gives an insignificant contribution to the sloshing induced force which is dominated by the inertia of entire filling water fig 13 presents ship surge motion and surge phase under incident waves the phase is defined with respect to the instant when the crest of incident wave is at midship the interesting phenomenon is that 0 3h t filling case has restrained ship surge response but the other two filling cases have significantly increased ship surge response these different surge behaviors are caused by the inertia effect of filling tank the low filling tanks have relatively small inertia because the volume of filling water is small compared with ship total displacement thus it turns the tanks to the anti surge tanks which have a similar function as anti rolling tank the restrained surge behavior of low filling tanks can also be understood through the phase difference between h 1 a and ship surge motion as given in fig 14 at the near resonance region where ship surge is restrained the phase difference between sloshing free surface h 1 a and ship surge reaches to nearly 90 additionally a certain discrepancy between experimental data and numerical results is found in fig 13 a this is very likely due to the limitation of linear theory in shallow filling conditions 4 2 2 ship heave and pitch responses fig 15 17 show the external wave patterns and the inner free surface shapes it cannot be shown in present study but it was observed that the wave patterns are very similar between numerical computation and experiment for the ship motion results given in fig 18 and 19 both the experimental data and the numerical results indicate that ship heave and pitch motions are insensitive to the sloshing effect except for one special case for which the filling level is 0 5h t and the wavelength λ l is 1 0 it must be stated that current symmetric hull has a weak heave pitch coupling effect for a real ship model the inner sloshing can be expected to change the ship heave motion and pitch motion at the same time fig 20 is the phase difference between h 1 a and the ship pitch response and it can be observed that the phase difference shifts to 180 when wave encounter frequency is close to tank natural frequency it indicates that the ship pitch response can be restrained as long as the sloshing induced force and moment become significant the coupling effect on ship pitch motion can also be explained in the viewpoint of model mass distribution because the moving ship in fact has a dynamic mass distribution which is caused by the inner sloshing fluid the sloshing fluid can change both the center of body mass and the moment of body inertia thus it indirectly affects the ship pitch behavior 4 2 3 mean motion and total resistance although the incident wave induces ship to have oscillatory motions and added resistance the tank inertia effect can still affect the ship mean attitude or the mean wet surface which determines an important part of ship total resistance fig 21 presents the ship mean positions and the total resistance coefficient c t it can be observed that the sloshing effect causes a smaller mean trim value compared with that of no sloshing case as explained in section 4 1 this sloshing effect occurs at the initial towing stage when ship does not meet incoming waves in addition the 0 5h t filling case shows a dropped resistance value at λ l 1 0 condition this drop is actually the reduced added resistance which will be revisited in the next section 4 2 4 added resistance fig 22 provides the added resistance results with respect to different filling conditions and varying incident wavelengths the added resistance data is found to be more scattering at the low filling condition it is because the ship with low filling condition has the small draft condition and small resistance that result in an increased ratio between the sensor noise and the resistance data at short wave regions linear potential theory still has limitations so that it provides the underestimated results comparing with experimental data when a ship moves forward in short waves mainly the diffraction waves that have nonlinear characteristics are generated near ship bow and this nonlinear phenomenon requires a further work for linear potential based method besides although the current ship model is a blunt body its slenderness or block coefficient is actually reduced as lowering the filling levels or draft condition the reduced slenderness causes another challenge for the present numerical computations similar to ship pitch motion added resistance is generally not sensitive to the sloshing effect except for one special case that a dropped data is found in fig 22 b section 2 3 has already confirmed that the resistance drop is not caused by any possible experimental uncertainties thus the reduced added resistance corresponds sufficiently with the restrained ship pitch motion moreover the drop can also be explained through the relative wave elevation along ship surface because the waterline integration of the relative wave elevation is an important component of ship added resistance as indicated by eq 26 fig 23 provides the wish analysis on the amplitude of the relative wave elevation along ship surface a is the input wave amplitude ζ is wave elevation δ is ship vertical motion from fig 23 b the sloshing case is observed to have a significantly decreased result 4 3 results in irregular waves considering the real ocean environment for sea trial it is necessary to estimate the sloshing coupling effect on the ship added resistance in irregular waves based on wave spectrum s ω and the transfer function r ω of regular waves the added resistance in irregular waves r irr can be estimated through the linear spectrum method as follows 29 r i r r 2 r ω a 2 s ω d ω since that most sea trials are performed at mild sea conditions the pierson moskowitz spectrum with sea states 2 3 4 is applied for analysis in these mild sea states the energy of wave spectrum mainly comes from short wave regions which means that the transfer function r ω of regular short waves has more contributions to r irr fig 24 presents the r irr as the ratio of calm water resistance r 0 although accumulated experimental uncertainties can exist sloshing cases generally show slightly smaller values comparing with no sloshing cases indicating that the sloshing effect reduces wave added resistance fig 24 also shows that the 0 3h t filling case provides higher added resistances than that of the other two filling cases it is because the 0 3h t filling condition has higher added resistance in regular short waves moreover an obvious difference can be observed for the sea state 4 in fig 24 b the difference is caused by the strong sloshing coupling effect at the resonant condition which has been widely discussed in previous sections however the reduction or increase of resistance is dependent on the ship and many factors such as hull form loading condition filling condition and wave condition therefore the present results cannot be interpreted as a general case 5 conclusions in this study a mathematical hull with two internal tanks is used to observe the inner sloshing effect on its forward motion in calm water regular head waves and irregular waves the observation is based on both experimental measurement and the time domain rankine panel method and a sufficient agreement has been found the coupling between the wave induced ship motions and the inner sloshing flow has been examined with different filling ratios and the following conclusions can be drawn for the present ship model and test conditions the calm water tests show that ship trim can be slightly restrained due to the large inertia of inner tanks the reduced trim condition does not significantly change ship wet surface as well as resistance because current test model is a fore aft symmetrical body however a real ship may experience a different resistance caused by internal heavy tanks for regular wave tests a noticeable inner sloshing flow is induced only when the wave encounter frequency becomes close to the natural frequency of inner tanks the inner sloshing flow is apparent through the ship surge response which differs depending on the tank filling ratios a low filling ratio can restrain the ship surge motion while a medium or high filling ratio significantly induces the ship surge response at the tank resonance region this phenomenon is due to the inertia effect of internal tanks the most violent sloshing flow is observed in medium filling tanks 0 5h t filling during the resonant sloshing the violent sloshing flow has a 180 phase difference with ship pitch motion it thus reduces the pitch responses as well as the relative wave elevation along ship which causes a significant drop of added resistance the reduced added resistance has been observed in both regular waves and irregular waves however except for the resonant case at medium filling ratio the inner sloshing flow is generally insensitive to ship heave pitch and resistance the linear potential based method which applies rankine panel method and linearized boundary value problem for both seakeeping and internal sloshing analysis has provided very reasonable results that agree sufficiently with experimental measurements therefore it can be used to predict the sloshing effect of ballast water in sea trials credit authorship contribution statement zhang zhu experiment computation formal

20603,in this study the effect of the collar plate usage on local scour around a pile due to propeller jet flow was investigated experimentally experiments were carried out for unconfined conditions only existence of a pile and a pile with collar plate three different collar plate widths w and two different locations of the collar plate with respect to the seabed hc were used to determine the effect of the collar plate on scour three different rotational speeds were used and scour around a pile was measured by using an acoustic doppler velocimeter profiler advp since the experiments were completed before reaching the equilibrium state present study can be considered as a short term study the results of the experimental studies show that the amount of reduction of scour around a pile is sensitive to the collar plate width and location of the collar plate a collar plate application is an effective way for reducing scour around a pile the most effective type of collar plate was determined as a condition in which w d and hc y0 are equal to 3 and 0 respectively the amount of reduction in scour around a pile was observed as 75 keywords pile collar plate propeller jet scour quay structures 1 introduction vessels as well as their engine and propeller systems have developed steadily with the increasing maritime trade in worldwide this development has also some effects on coastal structures specifically propeller jet induced main propellers or bow thrusters may cause serious washing effect and scour is observed on the seabed scour caused by the propeller jet has a significant importance in the stability of quay structures bergh and cederwall 1981 showed that 25 quay structures in sweden were damaged due to propeller jet qurrain 1994 found that 42 of ports in the united kingdom were damaged by propeller induced scour on the seabed pianc 2015 reported that the main propeller or transverse thrusters causes severe erosion impact on slopes underneath the berth or on the sea bottom container vessels ro ro vessels and ferries are major contributors to erosion near berths the erosion problems that occur near berth structures during a ship maneuvering due to propeller water jet cause bow or stern thrusters and main propellers of a ship are depicted in the pianc 2015 report fig 1 pianc 2015 distinguishes berth structures into two main types called solid berth structures and open berth structures solid berth structures are constructed in the berth front to resist the horizontal load from the fill and other live loads on the apron for open berth structures a load bearing slab supported by piles columns or lamellar walls is constructed stretching from the top of a dredged filled or natural slope to the berth front illustration of open type berth structures are given in fig 2 although the soil resisting vertical loads are slightly below the scour zone piles and slope are in danger considering scour pianc 2015 states that due to access difficulties under an open berth after the completion of the deck structure a maintenance free approach is usually preferred to build an open berth structure investigations of scouring due to propeller jet can be separated into two subtitles one of them is performed for determining the scour effect on the seabed without any structures unconfined propeller wash the other one is local scour around coastal structure confined propeller wash hamill et al 1999 investigated scouring effect for unconfined without a structure and confined in case of the existence of a structure propeller jet with experiments they have developed formulas to obtain maximum scour depth for both cases hong et al 2013 studied the development of a scour for non cohesive sediments on the seabed due to propeller jet they not only determined the effect of propeller jet on the seabed scouring but they also focused on time variation of the maximum scour depth for unconfined propeller jet tan and yuksel 2018 performed a similar experimental study to extend test conditions by using different non cohesive sediment median size different propeller offset height different propeller diameters they also modified the formula proposed by hong et al 2013 by using new data sets produced experimentally penna et al 2019 examined the effects of a propeller which was placed in different depths and rotational speeds in water they found that the general hypothesis of symmetrical scour with respect to the propeller longitudinal axis in the literature was not verified recently scour induced twin propeller jet has been investigated cui et al 2019 2019 and 2020 yew et al 2017 worked on scour mechanism due to twin propeller jet for unconfined condition and they proposed equations to predict temporal scour depths cihan et al 2012 investigated the influence of the structure slope angle under propeller jet flow effects on different types of berthing structures for this purpose experiments were carried out for three types of berthing structures i including an armored slope with toe ii including an armored slope without toe and iii a piled armored slope with toe and all these experiments were carried out for three different slope angles cihan 2014 examined the effect of jet propeller on berthing structures armoured slope combined with pile group experiments were performed for four types of berthing structures armoured slope with tandem arrangements of two and three piles and side by side arrangements of two and three piles yuksel et al 2018 investigated local scour around a pile structure due to propeller jet flow they presented an empirical equation developed for scour depths at the toe of the pile at equilibrium conditions none of the studies described so far have been tried a method to reduce local scour around a structure due to propeller jet flow day et al 2006 state that scour phenomenon is of high practical importance from the point of view of the stability of marine and river structures such as offshore platforms subsea templates bridges etc as excessive scour at piles is detrimental to the structures controlling measures for scour at piers or piles are important in terms of safety and economical life of piles or piers in present study it is aimed to reduce amount of maximum local scour depth around a pile structure due to propeller jet flow for this purpose a collar plate mounted on a pile was used in the tests in literature effect of a collar plate mounted on bridge piers on local scour was used under steady open channel flow zarrati et al 2004 investigated the effectiveness of the collar plates on rectangular piers for reduction of scour the effect of the collar plate width and the collar plate position with respect to flow direction on scour was also examined garg et al 2005 studied effect of multi the collar plate system on scour around a bridge pier zarrati et al 2006 examined the use of independent and continuous pier collar plates in combination with riprap for reducing local scour around bridge pier groups memar et al 2019 performed long duration tests to obtain the performance of the collar plates on scour reduction at tandem piers aligned with different skew angles wang et al 2019 carried out an experimental study to understand the effects of three design parameters including the collar plate installation height the collar plate external diameter and the collar plate protection range on the scour depth and scour development all previous studies showed that using the collar plate causes reduction on local scour around bridge piers under steady channel flow as mentioned before previous studies focused on scour around quay structures due to propeller jet but reduction methods of scour around open type quay structures due to propeller jet did not receive enough attention in the present study the effect of using a collar plate mounted on a pile on local scour due to propeller jet was investigated experimentally 2 experimental setup 2 1 methodology the experiments were carried out in a tank in hydraulics laboratory at kırıkkale university the experiments were performed for three different cases in the first case case 1 scour induced propeller jet was determined for unconfined condition which defined no pile case for two different propeller offset heights and three different propeller speed in the second case case 2 for same experiment condition duration of experiment propeller speed etc with case 1 scour due to existing of a pile was investigated for confined conditions and compared with case 1 in the third case case 3 to reduce scour around a pile the collar plates which had different widths w and vertical heights were used all test conditions were kept same with case 1 and case 2 to make a comparison in terms of scouring and to be able to determine effect of the collar plate applications 2 2 experimental setup a tank which had 2 m length 2 m width and 1 m height was constructed in hydraulics laboratory at kırıkkale university turkey the tank was filled and discharged by using pumps a non cohesive sediment layer which had 0 20 m height 2 m length and 1 5 m wide was placed to simulate the seabed inside the tank the tank was filled slowly with water until a still water level 40 cm to protect the seabed surface experiment setup is shown in figs 3a and 1 b the engine speed control device includes two parts hardware and software the hardware part consists of 12 v dc motor 12 v power supply driver and arduino boards and lcd screen the software part was created using the arduino platform the feedback signal required for pid control was provided by placing a magnet and hall sensor on the output shaft of the motor the motor was driven by the motor driver circuit with a 16 v 30 a capacity coded vnh2sp30 potentiometer was used for desired engine speed adjustments and oled graphic display was used to read desired speed and instantaneous speed using pid controller and kalman filters provided stable operation of the motor the value measured from the potentiometer was used as an input signal to the system a kalman filter was used to reduce fluctuations in the input signal pid controller was used for the motor to run at the desired speed in this way the engine could reach the desired speed in a few seconds and can remain stable at the desired speed propeller diameter was dp 0 06 m offset heights yo which define vertical distance between propeller center and the seabed were used in experiments as 0 06 m and 0 1 m properties of propeller are shown in table 1 to investigate scour caused propeller jet around a pile a steel pile with a diameter d of 0 06 cm was placed to 5dp away from propeller axis to reduce scour around a pile under same conditions the collar plates with different widths w were placed on pile at different points using a collar plates can have different effects on scour around pile if the collar plate position is below from the propeller axis downflow will be reduced by the collar plate due to interaction between propeller jet and pile surface on the other hand if the collar plate is placed on the seabed level it can also resist to jet flow in addition to downflow in front of the pile in this study two different collar plate positions hc and three different collar plate diameters dc were used in model experiments hc was defined a distance between the seabed and the collar plate position and hc was chosen as 0 05 cm and 0 the seabed also the collar plate widths w were chosen as 9 12 and 18 cm in fig 1 the collar plate locations on pile are shown the median sediment size and specific gravity of sand which was used to model the seabed in experiments were d50 0 24 mm and 2650 kg m3 respectively hong et al 2013 2015 cui et al 2020 used sediment which had same median size the geometric standard deviations which were given as σ g d 84 d 16 1 50 for sediments using the seabed d16 and d84 define the particle size for which 16 and 84 are finer by weight respectively the geometric standard deviation of the sediment value shows that the particle size distribution of sediment is moderately well sorted a 4 beam down looking acoustic doppler velocimeter profiler advp was used to measure the scour depth due to its capability of detecting the bottom boundary advp can determine the distance from the center transducer to the bottom the maximum range for the bottom measurements is limited to 35 cm from the central transducer to obtain changing of the seabed profiles during experiments the advp was mounted on a transverse system and measured the initial bed level as a reference elevation and the seabed level was measured at different moments to determine the time when scour reached the equilibrium state during tests so bottom distance for different points of scour profile was measured at 2 cm intervals advp has an advantage on measuring of the seabed profiles as it makes measurements in submerged position measurements of the seabed profiles were conducted at 1 h intervals i e t 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 h during these measurements propeller was turned off hamill 1987 and hong 2013 suggested that turning it on or off does not affect the development of the scour profile in addition to measurement of the seabed profile efflux velocities of propeller for different rotational speed were measured rotational speeds in this study were 600 720 and 840 rpm rotation per minutes and efflux velocities corresponding to rotational speeds of 600 720 840 rpm were 0 56 0 65 0 74 m s respectively the maximum velocity taken from a time averaged velocity distribution along the initial propeller plane was named as efflux velocity and denoted as u0 ryan 2002 maximum scour depth smax is the most important parameter on scour profile due to propeller jet flow for all cases smax was defined as function of effective parameters on scour as follows smax f u0 dp n y0 ρ ρ s μ g ν d d50 x w hc tc where u0 is the efflux velocity of the propeller dp is the diameter of the propeller n is the frequency of the propeller y0 is the offset height of the propeller ρ is the density of the fluid ρ s is the buoyant sediment density ρ s ρs ρ ρs is the sediment density μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid g is the acceleration of the gravity ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid d is diameter of pile dn50 is the sediment bed size x is the horizontal distance between propeller and pile w is the collar plate width hc is the collar plate height from the seabed tc is the collar plate thickness yuksel et al 2018 simplified relative scour depth in case of a pile without a collar plate as follows 1 s m a x d p s m a x d u 0 g d 50 δ d p d y 0 d p y 0 d x d y 0 d 50 in present study additional dimensionless parameters were added due to using the collar plate for a pile protected with a collar plate against scour induced propeller jet flow dimensionless parameters were given as follows 2 s m a x d p s m a x d u 0 g d 50 δ d p d y 0 d p y 0 d x d y 0 d 50 w d h c y 0 where u 0 g d 50 δ is called the densimetric froude number frd δ defines ρ s ρ verhey 1983 considered that if reynolds number of the propeller and reynolds number of the flow were greater than 7 104 and 3 103 respectively the effect of viscosity could be neglected reynolds number of the propeller reprop and reynolds number of the flow reflow could be calculated as follows 3 re p r o p n d p l m ν 4 re f l o w u 0 d p ν where ν is kinematic viscosity of the fluid n is the rotations per second and lm

kaa 1978 5 l m β d p π 2 n 1 d h d p 1 in this study the values of reynolds number of the propeller were calculated in between 1 104 and 1 4 104 moreover the values of reynolds number of the flow were calculated in between 3 3 104 and 4 4 104 in this study the reprop values were lower than 7 104 however blaauw and van de kaa 1978 and verhey 1983 stated that the scale effects are not significant penna et al 2019 stated that this hypothesis was later confirmed by lam et al 2010 and hamill and kee 2016 test conditions are summarized in table 2 in this study model was not scaled down considering a specific ship property the purpose of this study was to investigate a scour reduction method around a pile which was not studied before under propeller jet flow penna et al 2019 examined the effects induced by a rotating ship propeller in different conditions of submergence depth and rotational speed considering an unconfined jet it was stated that their model was not scaled down version of a particular prototype and their study should be evaluated as an investigation of the scouring and deposition processes induced by the rotation of a propeller near the seabed 3 results and discussion 3 1 unconfined scour tests hong et al 2013 proposed a schema for scouring formation of the seabed which is formed with cohesionless sediments due to propeller jet fig 4 according to hong et al 2013 primary scour and small scour occurring under the propeller and deposition mound behind the scour hole form at the equilibrium state defined as asymptotic stage in the unconfined scour tests case 1 propeller offset heights y0 were chosen as 0 06 and 0 1 m in case y0 is 0 06 m the scour profile stages defined by hong et al 2013 for all values of the propeller rotation speed were formed and the primary scour hole the small scour hole and the deposition zone were formed at the end of 7 h fig 5 however if y0 is 0 1 m the small scour hole did not form penna et al 2019 tan and yuksel 2018 reported a similar formation of scour profile and they stated that the formation of a small scour hole depends on the propeller height y0 and the propeller rotation speed rpm in fig 5 x defines distance from propeller axis in flow direction and z is elevation of the seabed with respect to reference measurement z is calculated by subtracting the seabed measurements taken at different moments of the experiment zt from the reference seabed measurement zref taken before experiment z zref zt fig 6 shows the variation of the seabed profile in case 1 for 720 rpm at different times developing of maximum scour depth smax with time was depicted in fig 7 when y0 dp is 1 67 sand ripples were formed downstream of the primary scour hole and no significant deposition zone was formed just downstream of the primary scour hole this situation did not change during the experiment period but the zone where the sand ripples formed grew cui et al 2020 stated that the researchers do not have a common idea about the moment the scour hole reaches equilibrium conditions while the equilibrium conditions were defined by penna et al 2019 as the moment when the scour hole remained constant and unchanged tan and yuksel 2018 used the definition given in chin et al s 1996 study conducted with water jet to define the equilibrium conditions they concluded that the flow pushes the sediment particles up to the upstream slope of the deposition mound but the particles slide back and settle into a stable location under the equilibrium condition because the particles do not have sufficient momentum to cross the deposition mound tan and yuksel 2018 operated the propellers for 200 min in their study and stated that there was no change in the maximum scour depth after 160 min hong et al 2013 stated in their study that the equilibrium conditions of the scour profile were reached at the end of 64 h while wei and chiew 2017 chose the duration of the experiment as 2 days and 16 h cui et al 2020 on the other hand showed that the equilibrium state was reached after 7 days in their scour experiments with twin propellers cui et al 2020 stated that 87 5 of the scouring occurred at the end of the 2 h experiment and therefore the 2 h period could be sufficient for equilibrium conditions yuksel et al 2018 defined the equilibrium condition as the profile which remained constant it was stated that the equilibrium condition varied within a range of 1 mm during the experiments in this study this definition of equilibrium condition is used to determine when the equilibrium condition occurs in the experiments the seabed profile was measured temporally so the changes of seabed profile with time has been obtained the equilibrium conditions are assumed to be reached when the variation of maximum scour depths remains constant it was also observed that the changes in the scour hole and accumulation zones in the profile were also almost constant as seen from figs 6 and 7 scour profiles totally reached to equilibrium conditions when the test duration was taken as 48 h for 720 rpm and it was seen in fig 7 there was no significant variations of smax after 24 h of test duration when the scour depths occurring in the equilibrium state are compared with the scour depths formed at the end of 7 h it is seen that 73 of scour depth was formed in 7 h same test was also performed for 600 rpm and it was seen that 65 of scour depth was formed in 7 h the aim of this study is not to focus on unconfined scour depth the aim of this study is to determine the effect of collar plate mounted on a pile on scour profile therefore experiments were performed for 7 h without reaching equilibrium conditions and the results were compared for all cases in present study test duration was chosen as 7 h for all cases to understand the effect of pile case2 and pile with the collar plate case3 on the seabed scour 3 2 scour formation in all tests the scour formation was observed under propeller jet mechanism in fig 8 critical curves for the initiation of scouring due to propeller jet proposed by hong et al 2013 and revised by tan and yuksel 2018 are shown the left hand side of the lines represents no scour conditions and the right hand side of the lines represents scour conditions it is seen that the results of the present study are compatible with the critical curve proposed by hong et al 2013 as mentioned before hong et al 2013 proposed a schema for scouring formation of the seabed which is formed with cohesionless sediments due to propeller jet according to hong et al 2013 primary scour and small scour occurring under the propeller and deposition mound behind the scour hole form at the equilibrium state were defined as asymptotic stage in present study primary scour hole occurred for all tests but small scour hole under the propeller did not occurr when y0 dp was 1 67 tan and yuksel 2018 and penna et al 2019 observed same condition they declared that formation of small scour under propeller depends on propeller height from seabed y0 propeller rotation speed rpm and propeller diameter dp tan and yuksel 2018 gave the critical curve to determine the conditions which have one or two scour holes considering frd and y0 dp in fig 9 it is seen that the result of the present study is inconsistent with the curve proposed by tan and yuksel 2018 it is thought that the main reason of disagreement between present study results and their results is using sands with different diameter d50 as seabed the sand diameter in present study is finer than sand diameter used in their study in present study the critical curve equation to determine small scour hole was revised according to results of present study a small scour hole was formed under the propeller for values of frd more than 8 135y0 dp 3 3 scour depths induced by propeller jet the prediction of the maximum scouring depth due to propeller jet flow is the most important purpose of these type studies in previous studies while some studies were carried out considering the effect of single propeller water jet on seabed some of them took into consideration twin propeller water jet on seabed empirical formulas proposed for predicting maximum scour depth can be divided into two different categories one of them is formulas which predict change of scour depths with time and other one estimates the scour depth that forms in equilibrium conditions these formulas are given in table 3 in fig 10 there is a comparison between the measured and calculated scour depths using equations proposed by cui et al 2019a b hamill 1988 hong et al 2013 and yew et al 2017 while equations proposed by hamill 1988 and hong et al 2013 use to estimate scour depths due to single propeller water jet equations proposed by cui et al 2019a b and yew et al 2017 are used to estimate scour due to twin propeller water jet flow cui et al 2019a b gave an equation predicting scour depths due to twin propeller flow jets by modifying equation proposed by hamill 1988 for predicting scour depth due to single propeller coefficients of determinations r2 between measured and predicted smax considering equations proposed by cui et al 2019a b hamill 1988 hong et al 2013 and yew et al 2017 were 0 83 0 60 0 82 0 64 respectively however root mean square error rmse values between measured and predicted values were given in table 4 it is seen that lowest rmse is calculated for equation proposed by hong et al 2013 sand diameter d50 0 24 mm used to form seabed in present study is similar with sand diameter used in study carried out by hong et al 2013 on the other hand when the equations proposed by cui et al 2019a b and hamill et al 1988 were used to predict scour depths with time considering experimental conditions used in present study it was seen that the relationship between predicted and measured scour depths for lower scour depths was rather weak because sand diameter d50 of present study is finer than sand diameter used by hamill 1988 and when the c d50 value equal to 291 67 in present study is outside the acceptable range of this equation scour depths decreases with increasing propeller rotation per minute rpm which causes increase in u0 and frd therefore it does not represent real conditions c d50 is one of the nondimensional component of scour depth equations proposed by hamill 1988 and c is defined clearance distance from propeller tip to bed 3 4 scour with existence of a pile scour around a pile was investigated for same test conditions used in case 1 therefore effect of existence of pile on scour depth was determined by comparing the results of case 1 scour profiles with the existence of pile are shown in fig 11 lp is the maximum length of the scour hole at the end of the tests for pile cases and bmax is the maximum width of the scour along the lateral direction in the axis of the pile in fig 11 the seabed profiles occurred in case of a pile located at x 30 cm away from propeller are depicted the existence of a cylindrical pile causes scour formation at upstream and downstream of a pile wei and chiew 2017 proclaimed that the development of scour hole is based on two scouring processes namely the jet diffusion and quay obstruction mechanisms chin et al 1996 observed a similar mechanism in their tests carried out to investigate local scour around a pile due to circular wall jet chin et al 1996 identified two basic mechanisms affecting the scour hole development around a vertical pile one of them is the pile obstruction and the other is jet diffusion mechanisms the jet flow attacks on the pile cause accelerating of flow and the vertical downflow forms at the stagnation plane of pile at the beginning the downflow and horseshoe vortex are relatively weak and they are getting stronger as the scour hole develops as the scour hole develops the downflow velocity increases chin et al 1996 also reported that the peak velocity of the downflow at the equilibrium condition is about 2 5 times that of the initial flatbed condition therefore they observed that the erosion process is dominated by the local acceleration at the early stages and the downflow and horseshoe vortex system govern the developing of scouring the second scouring mechanism defined by chin et al 1996 is the jet diffusion mechanism in this case the jet velocity controls the developing of scour when the jet shear stress on seabed exceeds the critical shear stress of the sediment particles erosion occurs a similar scouring mechanism was formed due to the interaction between the propeller flow and a single pile in the present study yuksel et al 2018 declared that if pile diameter is large y0 d 2 3 local maximum scour is formed at upstream of the pile just in front of the pile in the present study y0 d was used as 1 67 and as seen in fig 12 maximum local scour was formed at upstream of the pile for the same conditions with case 1 the existence of a pile case 2 caused an increase of smax compared to smax which occurred in case 1 the scour depths occurred for propeller speeds of 600 720 and 840 rpm in case 1 and case 2 were compared quantitatively in order to determine the effect of pile on scouring depth and it was seen that the percentage increase of the maximum scour depths varied between 66 and 272 3 5 scour in case of pile with collar plate in this section using collar plate to reduce scour around a pile was examined test conditions in case 1 and case 2 were used to determine the collar plate effect on scour around a pile zarrati et al 2006 enounced that a collar plate at any level above the seabed separates the flow into two zones above and below the collar plate in the zone above the collar plate the collar plate prevents the down flow and the down flow strength reduces on the collar plate in the zone below the collar plate the strength of down flow and therefore the horseshoe vortex decreases they also added that the efficiency of a collar plate on scour around a pile depends on the collar plate width and location on the pier with respect to the bed fig 13 depicts a schematic representation of the interaction between propeller jet flow and a pile with the collar plate as mentioned in the introduction the effect of a collar plate mounted on a pile on local scour was investigated under steady flow for bridge piers in previous studies in present study a collar plate that had different diameters and was located on different heights of a pile was used to reduce local scour around a pile the existence of a collar plate on a pile caused changing of the shape of scour profiles in comparison with the shape of scour profiles formed in case 2 these changing of the scour profiles based on the collar plate width w and the collar plate height from the seabed hc in fig 14 the scour profiles are shown for case 1 case 2 and case 3 together hc y0 0 5 w d 3 2 1 5 for case 3 in case collar plate height was 5 cm from seabed collar plate caused to decrease effect of downflow on seabed the effect of pile obstruction mechanism was weaker than effect of jet diffusion jet diffusion dominated on scour in front of the pile as stated by chin et al 1996 in their study formation of scour hole develops until the bed shear stresses and turbulent agitation are not capable of carrying sediment particles from the scour hole to the leeside of the deposition mound when the scour profiles of case 3 were compared to case 2 it was obviously seen that the maximum scour depths occurred at upstream of the pile decreased due to the collar plate effect on the other hand the scour depths just behind the pile were shallower than scour depths in front of the pile additionally the height of the deposition mound was lower for all collar plates used in the tests while the locations of the deposition mounds were closer to the pile for w d 3 and w d 2 they formed further at downstream of the pile for w d 1 5 scour profiles for w d 3 and w d 2 showed similar trend but scour profile for w d 1 5 was different from others due to the decrease in the collar plate width the downflow occurred in front of the pile was more effective on the seabed so the scour depth increased however the wake vortices behind the pile were more effective the deposition mound shape was more flattened and the scour depth at just downstream of the pile was formed deeper fig 15 shows the scour profiles measured for case 1 case 2 and case 3 together hc y0 0 w d 3 2 1 5 for case 3 as seen in fig 18 if the collar plate was located at the seabed level forming of scour profiles differed from case 2 and case 3 which hc y0 was 0 5 at the upstream of pile the scour depths decreased with increasing the collar plate width at downstream of pile the scour profiles showed the similar trend for all collar plates a small amount of scour occurred under the collar plates due to reducing the downflow and the wake vortices by using impermeable collar plates but beyond the border of the collar plates a scour hole formed at the upstream and downstream of pile therefore distance of the deposition mound from the pile increased considering the deposition mound location in case 2 and case 3 which hc y0 was 0 5 3 6 comparison of scour dimensions smax bmax lp occurring in case1 case2 and case3 when the effect of the collar plate width and the collar plate location on smax were compared it could be said that the most effective parameter was the collar plate location in fig 16 the variation between smax d and frd was depicted for two different values of hc y0 if the collar plate was placed on the seabed the scour was less than the second location of the collar plate hc y0 when the collar plate was located on the seabed local scour around pile decreased between 70 and 75 for w d 3 48 55 for w d 2 and 52 for w d 1 5 therefore if the collar plate was located on the pile which hc y0 is 0 5 local scour around the pile decreased between 28 and 55 for w d 3 27 55 for w d 2 and 28 for w d 1 5 as seen in fig 16 smax d is also based on the collar plate width when hc y0 was 0 on the seabed smax d decreased with the collar plate width increasing additionally if the collar plate width decreased w d 2 and w d 1 5 the values of smax d were approximately equaled for the same frd if the effect of the collar plate which hc y0 was 0 5 on local scour around the pile was considered it was seen that maximum scour occurred for the collar plate which had the minimum width w d 1 5 for w d 3 and w d 2 the values of smax d were almost equaled for this reason it could be said that the effect of the collar plate width on scour was stable after w d 2 when the collar plate location was hc y0 0 5 in table 5 smax and reductions due to using the collar plate were shown for all tests reduction r was calculated as follows 21 r s m a x s m a x c s m a x where smax and smaxc define the maximum scour depth in proximity to the pile without the collar plate and a pile with a collar plate respectively in fig 17 final scour profiles are shown for all cases when propeller speed is 840 rpm as seen in fig 17 downstream of the scour profiles in figs 17a and c shows similarity in terms of forming ripples due to fine seabed sediment because of the collar plate at 5 cm above the seabed the downflow was prevented to reach to the seabed and the jet flow of propeller had a dominant role on scour such as unconfined the seabed no pile on the other hand when the collar plate was placed on the seabed the scour profile at downstream of pile was similar to the scour profile occurred in case 2 because the wake vortices were effective in forming the seabed profile at downstream of the pile although figs 17b and d were not exactly similar they were similar in terms of their shapes and the location of the deposit zone to understand the effect of the collar plate on scour around a pile the seabed profile was measured along the lateral direction in the axis of the pile in fig 18 three different seabed profiles for propeller speed of 840 rpm were shown the collar plate location and the collar plate width were effective on changing of the seabed profiles but it was obviously seen that using the collar plate reduced the scour depth and the scour hole width bmax in fig 19 the variations of the relative scour hole length lp dp with frd were shown the longest lp dp formed for case 1 the values of lp dp for case 1 were between 7 and 10 the existence of a pile caused reducing of lp dp with respect to lp dp formed for case 1 when a pile was placed to obstruct propeller flow the values of lp dp were between 6 and 7 but when the collar plate was mounted on the pile above 0 05 m from the seabed hc y0 0 5 the values of lp dp for w d 2 and w d 3 were shorter than the values of lp dp occurred in case 2 on the other hand the value of lp dp was almost the same for w d 1 5 in case 2 corresponding to the same frd as mentioned before it means that distance between the deposition mound and the pile decreased however if the collar plate was placed on the seabed level the values of lp dp were longer than the values of lp dp occurred in case 2 for all the collar plates the values of lp dp were between 7 and 8 5 and they were closer to the values of lp dp measured for case 1 it also could be said that the distance between the deposition mound and the pile increased using collar plate to reduce the scour around a pier was studied several times in previous studies considering steady channel flow alabi 2006 mashahir et al 2004 and tafarojnoruz et al 2012 stated that a collar delayed the development of the scour hole it was found that since a collar reduces the scour rate when tests are performed to determine effect of collars on scouring around a pier test duration should be much longer with respect to tests for pier without a collar to reach the equilibrium condition alabi 2006 also declared that erroneous results may be obtained if tests are completed earlier than the time to reach equilibrium state the experimental results presented so far were obtained after 7 h since the experiments are completed before reaching the equilibrium state present study can be considered as a short term study although the propeller water jet and the steady channel flow characteristics differ from each other using collar plate may delay the development of scour hole due to propeller water jet increasing the duration to reach the equilibrium condition can be considered as an advantage of using collars however the efficiency of the collar in long term tests is unclear due to short term tests which is performed in this study 3 7 discussion on the effect of collar plates on scour which induces twin propeller jet around a pile cui et al 2020 and yew et al 2017 investigated scour mechanism of twin propeller for unconfined conditions cui et al 2020 performed their tests for two different rotating directions of twin propellers twin propellers were divided into two types called internal rotating and external rotating twin propellers according to the rotation direction of propellers looking at the propellers from stern the propeller on the right side rotates clockwise it was called as external rotating twin propeller ecrtp the opposite was called as internal rotating twin propeller icrtp cui et al 2020 reported that ecrtp produced the two maximum scour holes but icrtp caused only one maximum scour hole the maximum scour depth of icrtp is occurred on the symmetrical plane of the propeller however the maximum scour depth of ecrtp does not occur at the position of the central axis of the two propellers but along the rotational axis of the two propellers a ridge forms on the symmetrical plane between the two maximum scouring depths yew et al 2017 also conducted experiments with ecrtp defined by cui et al 2020 they showed similarly with cui et al 2020 that a merged scour profile could form depending on c dp and rotation speed rpm for detailed information see the cui et al 2020 and yew et al 2017 if twin propeller water jet is confined with a pile two different scour profiles can be observed considering the location of pile and the rotation direction of propellers if a pile is located at the position of the central axis of the two propellers scour around pile can increase due to the interaction between twin propeller water jet and pile similarly scour which occurs around a pile due to single propeller water jet the location of deposition mound would form in closer region on the other hand if a pile located on the symmetrical plane of icrtp scour depth occurred at upstream of the pile increases and distance between the deposition mound and the pile would be closer if the collar proposed in this study is used around the pile it is thought that the scour depths occurred around the pile because of twin propellers water jet decrease it is anticipated that placing the collar at seabed level would be more effective by reducing scour depth around a pile 4 conclusions laboratory experiments to reduce the local scour around a pile due to a propeller wash were conducted with three different collar plate widths two different the collar plate positions in vertical direction and three different propeller speeds in a water tank this study focused on the effect of the collar plate on reducing the scour around a pile tests conducted for different cases were not continued until equilibrium conditions since as shown for case 1 most of the scour depth occurred at the end of the 7 h test for this reason results of this study may be valid for short term analysis however the efficiency of the collar plate in long term tests is uncertain considering the results of this study on the other hand it is considered that the results show the effect of using collar plates are useful to reduce the scour depths due to propeller jet around the pile for short duration tests the conclusions of short term analysis are as follows 1 maximum scour depths for all cases case 1 case 2 case 3 increase with propeller speed increment 2 when the predicted scour depths by using proposed formulas in previous studies and the measured scour depths were compared it was determined that the differences between them resulted from the different test conditions propeller diameter dp propeller offset height y0 rotation speed rpm and sand diameter dn50 are of great importance on scour the sand diameter used in this study is generally finer than those used in previous studies penna et al 2019 hamill 1988 hamill et al 1999 tan and yüksel 2018 since the sand diameter used by hong et al 2013 was compatible with this study the best agreement was obtained between the measured scour depths in present study and calculated scour depths by using formula proposed by hong et al 2013 3 in case 2 local scour depths smax around a pile are larger than in case 1 and case 3 due to obstruction effect of pile without using the collar plate 4 using the collar plate causes the reduction of smax and changing the seabed profiles due to propeller jet if they are compared with respect to the location of the collar plate it can be said that when the collar plate is located on the seabed hc y0 0 reduction of smax is larger than reduction occurred when the collar plate is located on pile hc y0 0 5 the location of the collar plate affects formation of the seabed profiles when it is located on the seabed level distance between the peak height of the deposition mound and the rear side of pile increases at downstream of the pile however if the collar plate is placed in its second position hc y0 0 5 the peak height of the deposition mound occurs closer to rear side of the pile 5 the width of the collar plate is one of the most important parameters for reducing of scour generally it can be said that smax decreases by increasing the collar plate width this result is compatible with results obtained from experiments carried out to reduce scour around bridge piers by using the collar plates on the other hand if the collar plate is on the seabed level the collar plate width is more effective on reducing scour also if the collar plate is on the second position while smax is almost same for w d 2 and w d 3 smax is deeper for w d 1 5 it can be said that local scour is based on the effect of jet diffusion for wider collar plates on the other hand as the width of the collar plate decreases the downflow due to obstruction of the pile is getting to be effective on scour besides the jet diffusion 6 the effect of the parameters such as propeller diameter pile location pile diameter sediment diameter kept constant in this study on scour around a pile should be investigated by experimental studies in order to understand the effect of the collar plate on scour around a pile therefore test duration has a significant importance on scouring around a pile with collar plate tests may be performed much longer to understand collar plate effect on scour around a pile under propeller water jet thus the test results can be used to obtain formulas that estimate the depth of scour in case of collar plates credit authorship contribution statement kubilay cihan conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

20603,in this study the effect of the collar plate usage on local scour around a pile due to propeller jet flow was investigated experimentally experiments were carried out for unconfined conditions only existence of a pile and a pile with collar plate three different collar plate widths w and two different locations of the collar plate with respect to the seabed hc were used to determine the effect of the collar plate on scour three different rotational speeds were used and scour around a pile was measured by using an acoustic doppler velocimeter profiler advp since the experiments were completed before reaching the equilibrium state present study can be considered as a short term study the results of the experimental studies show that the amount of reduction of scour around a pile is sensitive to the collar plate width and location of the collar plate a collar plate application is an effective way for reducing scour around a pile the most effective type of collar plate was determined as a condition in which w d and hc y0 are equal to 3 and 0 respectively the amount of reduction in scour around a pile was observed as 75 keywords pile collar plate propeller jet scour quay structures 1 introduction vessels as well as their engine and propeller systems have developed steadily with the increasing maritime trade in worldwide this development has also some effects on coastal structures specifically propeller jet induced main propellers or bow thrusters may cause serious washing effect and scour is observed on the seabed scour caused by the propeller jet has a significant importance in the stability of quay structures bergh and cederwall 1981 showed that 25 quay structures in sweden were damaged due to propeller jet qurrain 1994 found that 42 of ports in the united kingdom were damaged by propeller induced scour on the seabed pianc 2015 reported that the main propeller or transverse thrusters causes severe erosion impact on slopes underneath the berth or on the sea bottom container vessels ro ro vessels and ferries are major contributors to erosion near berths the erosion problems that occur near berth structures during a ship maneuvering due to propeller water jet cause bow or stern thrusters and main propellers of a ship are depicted in the pianc 2015 report fig 1 pianc 2015 distinguishes berth structures into two main types called solid berth structures and open berth structures solid berth structures are constructed in the berth front to resist the horizontal load from the fill and other live loads on the apron for open berth structures a load bearing slab supported by piles columns or lamellar walls is constructed stretching from the top of a dredged filled or natural slope to the berth front illustration of open type berth structures are given in fig 2 although the soil resisting vertical loads are slightly below the scour zone piles and slope are in danger considering scour pianc 2015 states that due to access difficulties under an open berth after the completion of the deck structure a maintenance free approach is usually preferred to build an open berth structure investigations of scouring due to propeller jet can be separated into two subtitles one of them is performed for determining the scour effect on the seabed without any structures unconfined propeller wash the other one is local scour around coastal structure confined propeller wash hamill et al 1999 investigated scouring effect for unconfined without a structure and confined in case of the existence of a structure propeller jet with experiments they have developed formulas to obtain maximum scour depth for both cases hong et al 2013 studied the development of a scour for non cohesive sediments on the seabed due to propeller jet they not only determined the effect of propeller jet on the seabed scouring but they also focused on time variation of the maximum scour depth for unconfined propeller jet tan and yuksel 2018 performed a similar experimental study to extend test conditions by using different non cohesive sediment median size different propeller offset height different propeller diameters they also modified the formula proposed by hong et al 2013 by using new data sets produced experimentally penna et al 2019 examined the effects of a propeller which was placed in different depths and rotational speeds in water they found that the general hypothesis of symmetrical scour with respect to the propeller longitudinal axis in the literature was not verified recently scour induced twin propeller jet has been investigated cui et al 2019 2019 and 2020 yew et al 2017 worked on scour mechanism due to twin propeller jet for unconfined condition and they proposed equations to predict temporal scour depths cihan et al 2012 investigated the influence of the structure slope angle under propeller jet flow effects on different types of berthing structures for this purpose experiments were carried out for three types of berthing structures i including an armored slope with toe ii including an armored slope without toe and iii a piled armored slope with toe and all these experiments were carried out for three different slope angles cihan 2014 examined the effect of jet propeller on berthing structures armoured slope combined with pile group experiments were performed for four types of berthing structures armoured slope with tandem arrangements of two and three piles and side by side arrangements of two and three piles yuksel et al 2018 investigated local scour around a pile structure due to propeller jet flow they presented an empirical equation developed for scour depths at the toe of the pile at equilibrium conditions none of the studies described so far have been tried a method to reduce local scour around a structure due to propeller jet flow day et al 2006 state that scour phenomenon is of high practical importance from the point of view of the stability of marine and river structures such as offshore platforms subsea templates bridges etc as excessive scour at piles is detrimental to the structures controlling measures for scour at piers or piles are important in terms of safety and economical life of piles or piers in present study it is aimed to reduce amount of maximum local scour depth around a pile structure due to propeller jet flow for this purpose a collar plate mounted on a pile was used in the tests in literature effect of a collar plate mounted on bridge piers on local scour was used under steady open channel flow zarrati et al 2004 investigated the effectiveness of the collar plates on rectangular piers for reduction of scour the effect of the collar plate width and the collar plate position with respect to flow direction on scour was also examined garg et al 2005 studied effect of multi the collar plate system on scour around a bridge pier zarrati et al 2006 examined the use of independent and continuous pier collar plates in combination with riprap for reducing local scour around bridge pier groups memar et al 2019 performed long duration tests to obtain the performance of the collar plates on scour reduction at tandem piers aligned with different skew angles wang et al 2019 carried out an experimental study to understand the effects of three design parameters including the collar plate installation height the collar plate external diameter and the collar plate protection range on the scour depth and scour development all previous studies showed that using the collar plate causes reduction on local scour around bridge piers under steady channel flow as mentioned before previous studies focused on scour around quay structures due to propeller jet but reduction methods of scour around open type quay structures due to propeller jet did not receive enough attention in the present study the effect of using a collar plate mounted on a pile on local scour due to propeller jet was investigated experimentally 2 experimental setup 2 1 methodology the experiments were carried out in a tank in hydraulics laboratory at kırıkkale university the experiments were performed for three different cases in the first case case 1 scour induced propeller jet was determined for unconfined condition which defined no pile case for two different propeller offset heights and three different propeller speed in the second case case 2 for same experiment condition duration of experiment propeller speed etc with case 1 scour due to existing of a pile was investigated for confined conditions and compared with case 1 in the third case case 3 to reduce scour around a pile the collar plates which had different widths w and vertical heights were used all test conditions were kept same with case 1 and case 2 to make a comparison in terms of scouring and to be able to determine effect of the collar plate applications 2 2 experimental setup a tank which had 2 m length 2 m width and 1 m height was constructed in hydraulics laboratory at kırıkkale university turkey the tank was filled and discharged by using pumps a non cohesive sediment layer which had 0 20 m height 2 m length and 1 5 m wide was placed to simulate the seabed inside the tank the tank was filled slowly with water until a still water level 40 cm to protect the seabed surface experiment setup is shown in figs 3a and 1 b the engine speed control device includes two parts hardware and software the hardware part consists of 12 v dc motor 12 v power supply driver and arduino boards and lcd screen the software part was created using the arduino platform the feedback signal required for pid control was provided by placing a magnet and hall sensor on the output shaft of the motor the motor was driven by the motor driver circuit with a 16 v 30 a capacity coded vnh2sp30 potentiometer was used for desired engine speed adjustments and oled graphic display was used to read desired speed and instantaneous speed using pid controller and kalman filters provided stable operation of the motor the value measured from the potentiometer was used as an input signal to the system a kalman filter was used to reduce fluctuations in the input signal pid controller was used for the motor to run at the desired speed in this way the engine could reach the desired speed in a few seconds and can remain stable at the desired speed propeller diameter was dp 0 06 m offset heights yo which define vertical distance between propeller center and the seabed were used in experiments as 0 06 m and 0 1 m properties of propeller are shown in table 1 to investigate scour caused propeller jet around a pile a steel pile with a diameter d of 0 06 cm was placed to 5dp away from propeller axis to reduce scour around a pile under same conditions the collar plates with different widths w were placed on pile at different points using a collar plates can have different effects on scour around pile if the collar plate position is below from the propeller axis downflow will be reduced by the collar plate due to interaction between propeller jet and pile surface on the other hand if the collar plate is placed on the seabed level it can also resist to jet flow in addition to downflow in front of the pile in this study two different collar plate positions hc and three different collar plate diameters dc were used in model experiments hc was defined a distance between the seabed and the collar plate position and hc was chosen as 0 05 cm and 0 the seabed also the collar plate widths w were chosen as 9 12 and 18 cm in fig 1 the collar plate locations on pile are shown the median sediment size and specific gravity of sand which was used to model the seabed in experiments were d50 0 24 mm and 2650 kg m3 respectively hong et al 2013 2015 cui et al 2020 used sediment which had same median size the geometric standard deviations which were given as σ g d 84 d 16 1 50 for sediments using the seabed d16 and d84 define the particle size for which 16 and 84 are finer by weight respectively the geometric standard deviation of the sediment value shows that the particle size distribution of sediment is moderately well sorted a 4 beam down looking acoustic doppler velocimeter profiler advp was used to measure the scour depth due to its capability of detecting the bottom boundary advp can determine the distance from the center transducer to the bottom the maximum range for the bottom measurements is limited to 35 cm from the central transducer to obtain changing of the seabed profiles during experiments the advp was mounted on a transverse system and measured the initial bed level as a reference elevation and the seabed level was measured at different moments to determine the time when scour reached the equilibrium state during tests so bottom distance for different points of scour profile was measured at 2 cm intervals advp has an advantage on measuring of the seabed profiles as it makes measurements in submerged position measurements of the seabed profiles were conducted at 1 h intervals i e t 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 h during these measurements propeller was turned off hamill 1987 and hong 2013 suggested that turning it on or off does not affect the development of the scour profile in addition to measurement of the seabed profile efflux velocities of propeller for different rotational speed were measured rotational speeds in this study were 600 720 and 840 rpm rotation per minutes and efflux velocities corresponding to rotational speeds of 600 720 840 rpm were 0 56 0 65 0 74 m s respectively the maximum velocity taken from a time averaged velocity distribution along the initial propeller plane was named as efflux velocity and denoted as u0 ryan 2002 maximum scour depth smax is the most important parameter on scour profile due to propeller jet flow for all cases smax was defined as function of effective parameters on scour as follows smax f u0 dp n y0 ρ ρ s μ g ν d d50 x w hc tc where u0 is the efflux velocity of the propeller dp is the diameter of the propeller n is the frequency of the propeller y0 is the offset height of the propeller ρ is the density of the fluid ρ s is the buoyant sediment density ρ s ρs ρ ρs is the sediment density μ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid g is the acceleration of the gravity ν is the kinematic viscosity of fluid d is diameter of pile dn50 is the sediment bed size x is the horizontal distance between propeller and pile w is the collar plate width hc is the collar plate height from the seabed tc is the collar plate thickness yuksel et al 2018 simplified relative scour depth in case of a pile without a collar plate as follows 1 s m a x d p s m a x d u 0 g d 50 δ d p d y 0 d p y 0 d x d y 0 d 50 in present study additional dimensionless parameters were added due to using the collar plate for a pile protected with a collar plate against scour induced propeller jet flow dimensionless parameters were given as follows 2 s m a x d p s m a x d u 0 g d 50 δ d p d y 0 d p y 0 d x d y 0 d 50 w d h c y 0 where u 0 g d 50 δ is called the densimetric froude number frd δ defines ρ s ρ verhey 1983 considered that if reynolds number of the propeller and reynolds number of the flow were greater than 7 104 and 3 103 respectively the effect of viscosity could be neglected reynolds number of the propeller reprop and reynolds number of the flow reflow could be calculated as follows 3 re p r o p n d p l m ν 4 re f l o w u 0 d p ν where ν is kinematic viscosity of the fluid n is the rotations per second and lm is a term depend on the blade area ratio β and number of blades of the propeller n the propeller diameter dp the diameter of hub dh the lm is calculated using formula suggested by blaauw and van de kaa 1978 5 l m β d p π 2 n 1 d h d p 1 in this study the values of reynolds number of the propeller were calculated in between 1 104 and 1 4 104 moreover the values of reynolds number of the flow were calculated in between 3 3 104 and 4 4 104 in this study the reprop values were lower than 7 104 however blaauw and van de kaa 1978 and verhey 1983 stated that the scale effects are not significant penna et al 2019 stated that this hypothesis was later confirmed by lam et al 2010 and hamill and kee 2016 test conditions are summarized in table 2 in this study model was not scaled down considering a specific ship property the purpose of this study was to investigate a scour reduction method around a pile which was not studied before under propeller jet flow penna et al 2019 examined the effects induced by a rotating ship propeller in different conditions of submergence depth and rotational speed considering an unconfined jet it was stated that their model was not scaled down version of a particular prototype and their study should be evaluated as an investigation of the scouring and deposition processes induced by the rotation of a propeller near the seabed 3 results and discussion 3 1 unconfined scour tests hong et al 2013 proposed a schema for scouring formation of the seabed which is formed with cohesionless sediments due to propeller jet fig 4 according to hong et al 2013 primary scour and small scour occurring under the propeller and deposition mound behind the scour hole form at the equilibrium state defined as asymptotic stage in the unconfined scour tests case 1 propeller offset heights y0 were chosen as 0 06 and 0 1 m in case y0 is 0 06 m the scour profile stages defined by hong et al 2013 for all values of the propeller rotation speed were formed and the primary scour hole the small scour hole and the deposition zone were formed at the end of 7 h fig 5 however if y0 is 0 1 m the small scour hole did not form penna et al 2019 tan and yuksel 2018 reported a similar formation of scour profile and they stated that the formation of a small scour hole depends on the propeller height y0 and the propeller rotation speed rpm in fig 5 x defines distance from propeller axis in flow direction and z is elevation of the seabed with respect to reference measurement z is calculated by subtracting the seabed measurements taken at different moments of the experiment zt from the reference seabed measurement zref taken before experiment z zref zt fig 6 shows the variation of the seabed profile in case 1 for 720 rpm at different times developing of maximum scour depth smax with time was depicted in fig 7 when y0 dp is 1 67 sand ripples were formed downstream of the primary scour hole and no significant deposition zone was formed just downstream of the primary scour hole this situation did not change during the experiment period but the zone where the sand ripples formed grew cui et al 2020 stated that the researchers do not have a common idea about the moment the scour hole reaches equilibrium conditions while the equilibrium conditions were defined by penna et al 2019 as the moment when the scour hole remained constant and unchanged tan and yuksel 2018 used the definition given in chin et al s 1996 study conducted with water jet to define the equilibrium conditions they concluded that the flow pushes the sediment particles up to the upstream slope of the deposition mound but the particles slide back and settle into a stable location under the equilibrium condition because the particles do not have sufficient momentum to cross the deposition mound tan and yuksel 2018 operated the propellers for 200 min in their study and stated that there was no change in the maximum scour depth after 160 min hong et al 2013 stated in their study that the equilibrium conditions of the scour profile were reached at the end of 64 h while wei and chiew 2017 chose the duration of the experiment as 2 days and 16 h cui et al 2020 on the other hand showed that the equilibrium state was reached after 7 days in their scour experiments with twin propellers cui et al 2020 stated that 87 5 of the scouring occurred at the end of the 2 h experiment and therefore the 2 h period could be sufficient for equilibrium conditions yuksel et al 2018 defined the equilibrium condition as the profile which remained constant it was stated that the equilibrium condition varied within a range of 1 mm during the experiments in this study this definition of equilibrium condition is used to determine when the equilibrium condition occurs in the experiments the seabed profile was measured temporally so the changes of seabed profile with time has been obtained the equilibrium conditions are assumed to be reached when the variation of maximum scour depths remains constant it was also observed that the changes in the scour hole and accumulation zones in the profile were also almost constant as seen from figs 6 and 7 scour profiles totally reached to equilibrium conditions when the test duration was taken as 48 h for 720 rpm and it was seen in fig 7 there was no significant variations of smax after 24 h of test duration when the scour depths occurring in the equilibrium state are compared with the scour depths formed at the end of 7 h it is seen that 73 of scour depth was formed in 7 h same test was also performed for 600 rpm and it was seen that 65 of scour depth was formed in 7 h the aim of this study is not to focus on unconfined scour depth the aim of this study is to determine the effect of collar plate mounted on a pile on scour profile therefore experiments were performed for 7 h without reaching equilibrium conditions and the results were compared for all cases in present study test duration was chosen as 7 h for all cases to understand the effect of pile case2 and pile with the collar plate case3 on the seabed scour 3 2 scour formation in all tests the scour formation was observed under propeller jet mechanism in fig 8 critical curves for the initiation of scouring due to propeller jet proposed by hong et al 2013 and revised by tan and yuksel 2018 are shown the left hand side of the lines represents no scour conditions and the right hand side of the lines represents scour conditions it is seen that the results of the present study are compatible with the critical curve proposed by hong et al 2013 as mentioned before hong et al 2013 proposed a schema for scouring formation of the seabed which is formed with cohesionless sediments due to propeller jet according to hong et al 2013 primary scour and small scour occurring under the propeller and deposition mound behind the scour hole form at the equilibrium state were defined as asymptotic stage in present study primary scour hole occurred for all tests but small scour hole under the propeller did not occurr when y0 dp was 1 67 tan and yuksel 2018 and penna et al 2019 observed same condition they declared that formation of small scour under propeller depends on propeller height from seabed y0 propeller rotation speed rpm and propeller diameter dp tan and yuksel 2018 gave the critical curve to determine the conditions which have one or two scour holes considering frd and y0 dp in fig 9 it is seen that the result of the present study is inconsistent with the curve proposed by tan and yuksel 2018 it is thought that the main reason of disagreement between present study results and their results is using sands with different diameter d50 as seabed the sand diameter in present study is finer than sand diameter used in their study in present study the critical curve equation to determine small scour hole was revised according to results of present study a small scour hole was formed under the propeller for values of frd more than 8 135y0 dp 3 3 scour depths induced by propeller jet the prediction of the maximum scouring depth due to propeller jet flow is the most important purpose of these type studies in previous studies while some studies were carried out considering the effect of single propeller water jet on seabed some of them took into consideration twin propeller water jet on seabed empirical formulas proposed for predicting maximum scour depth can be divided into two different categories one of them is formulas which predict change of scour depths with time and other one estimates the scour depth that forms in equilibrium conditions these formulas are given in table 3 in fig 10 there is a comparison between the measured and calculated scour depths using equations proposed by cui et al 2019a b hamill 1988 hong et al 2013 and yew et al 2017 while equations proposed by hamill 1988 and hong et al 2013 use to estimate scour depths due to single propeller water jet equations proposed by cui et al 2019a b and yew et al 2017 are used to estimate scour due to twin propeller water jet flow cui et al 2019a b gave an equation predicting scour depths due to twin propeller flow jets by modifying equation proposed by hamill 1988 for predicting scour depth due to single propeller coefficients of determinations r2 between measured and predicted smax considering equations proposed by cui et al 2019a b hamill 1988 hong et al 2013 and yew et al 2017 were 0 83 0 60 0 82 0 64 respectively however root mean square error rmse values between measured and predicted values were given in table 4 it is seen that lowest rmse is calculated for equation proposed by hong et al 2013 sand diameter d50 0 24 mm used to form seabed in present study is similar with sand diameter used in study carried out by hong et al 2013 on the other hand when the equations proposed by cui et al 2019a b and hamill et al 1988 were used to predict scour depths with time considering experimental conditions used in present study it was seen that the relationship between predicted and measured scour depths for lower scour depths was rather weak because sand diameter d50 of present study is finer than sand diameter used by hamill 1988 and when the c d50 value equal to 291 67 in present study is outside the acceptable range of this equation scour depths decreases with increasing propeller rotation per minute rpm which causes increase in u0 and frd therefore it does not represent real conditions c d50 is one of the nondimensional component of scour depth equations proposed by hamill 1988 and c is defined clearance distance from propeller tip to bed 3 4 scour with existence of a pile scour around a pile was investigated for same test conditions used in case 1 therefore effect of existence of pile on scour depth was determined by comparing the results of case 1 scour profiles with the existence of pile are shown in fig 11 lp is the maximum length of the scour hole at the end of the tests for pile cases and bmax is the maximum width of the scour along the lateral direction in the axis of the pile in fig 11 the seabed profiles occurred in case of a pile located at x 30 cm away from propeller are depicted the existence of a cylindrical pile causes scour formation at upstream and downstream of a pile wei and chiew 2017 proclaimed that the development of scour hole is based on two scouring processes namely the jet diffusion and quay obstruction mechanisms chin et al 1996 observed a similar mechanism in their tests carried out to investigate local scour around a pile due to circular wall jet chin et al 1996 identified two basic mechanisms affecting the scour hole development around a vertical pile one of them is the pile obstruction and the other is jet diffusion mechanisms the jet flow attacks on the pile cause accelerating of flow and the vertical downflow forms at the stagnation plane of pile at the beginning the downflow and horseshoe vortex are relatively weak and they are getting stronger as the scour hole develops as the scour hole develops the downflow velocity increases chin et al 1996 also reported that the peak velocity of the downflow at the equilibrium condition is about 2 5 times that of the initial flatbed condition therefore they observed that the erosion process is dominated by the local acceleration at the early stages and the downflow and horseshoe vortex system govern the developing of scouring the second scouring mechanism defined by chin et al 1996 is the jet diffusion mechanism in this case the jet velocity controls the developing of scour when the jet shear stress on seabed exceeds the critical shear stress of the sediment particles erosion occurs a similar scouring mechanism was formed due to the interaction between the propeller flow and a single pile in the present study yuksel et al 2018 declared that if pile diameter is large y0 d 2 3 local maximum scour is formed at upstream of the pile just in front of the pile in the present study y0 d was used as 1 67 and as seen in fig 12 maximum local scour was formed at upstream of the pile for the same conditions with case 1 the existence of a pile case 2 caused an increase of smax compared to smax which occurred in case 1 the scour depths occurred for propeller speeds of 600 720 and 840 rpm in case 1 and case 2 were compared quantitatively in order to determine the effect of pile on scouring depth and it was seen that the percentage increase of the maximum scour depths varied between 66 and 272 3 5 scour in case of pile with collar plate in this section using collar plate to reduce scour around a pile was examined test conditions in case 1 and case 2 were used to determine the collar plate effect on scour around a pile zarrati et al 2006 enounced that a collar plate at any level above the seabed separates the flow into two zones above and below the collar plate in the zone above the collar plate the collar plate prevents the down flow and the down flow strength reduces on the collar plate in the zone below the collar plate the strength of down flow and therefore the horseshoe vortex decreases they also added that the efficiency of a collar plate on scour around a pile depends on the collar plate width and location on the pier with respect to the bed fig 13 depicts a schematic representation of the interaction between propeller jet flow and a pile with the collar plate as mentioned in the introduction the effect of a collar plate mounted on a pile on local scour was investigated under steady flow for bridge piers in previous studies in present study a collar plate that had different diameters and was located on different heights of a pile was used to reduce local scour around a pile the existence of a collar plate on a pile caused changing of the shape of scour profiles in comparison with the shape of scour profiles formed in case 2 these changing of the scour profiles based on the collar plate width w and the collar plate height from the seabed hc in fig 14 the scour profiles are shown for case 1 case 2 and case 3 together hc y0 0 5 w d 3 2 1 5 for case 3 in case collar plate height was 5 cm from seabed collar plate caused to decrease effect of downflow on seabed the effect of pile obstruction mechanism was weaker than effect of jet diffusion jet diffusion dominated on scour in front of the pile as stated by chin et al 1996 in their study formation of scour hole develops until the bed shear stresses and turbulent agitation are not capable of carrying sediment particles from the scour hole to the leeside of the deposition mound when the scour profiles of case 3 were compared to case 2 it was obviously seen that the maximum scour depths occurred at upstream of the pile decreased due to the collar plate effect on the other hand the scour depths just behind the pile were shallower than scour depths in front of the pile additionally the height of the deposition mound was lower for all collar plates used in the tests while the locations of the deposition mounds were closer to the pile for w d 3 and w d 2 they formed further at downstream of the pile for w d 1 5 scour profiles for w d 3 and w d 2 showed similar trend but scour profile for w d 1 5 was different from others due to the decrease in the collar plate width the downflow occurred in front of the pile was more effective on the seabed so the scour depth increased however the wake vortices behind the pile were more effective the deposition mound shape was more flattened and the scour depth at just downstream of the pile was formed deeper fig 15 shows the scour profiles measured for case 1 case 2 and case 3 together hc y0 0 w d 3 2 1 5 for case 3 as seen in fig 18 if the collar plate was located at the seabed level forming of scour profiles differed from case 2 and case 3 which hc y0 was 0 5 at the upstream of pile the scour depths decreased with increasing the collar plate width at downstream of pile the scour profiles showed the similar trend for all collar plates a small amount of scour occurred under the collar plates due to reducing the downflow and the wake vortices by using impermeable collar plates but beyond the border of the collar plates a scour hole formed at the upstream and downstream of pile therefore distance of the deposition mound from the pile increased considering the deposition mound location in case 2 and case 3 which hc y0 was 0 5 3 6 comparison of scour dimensions smax bmax lp occurring in case1 case2 and case3 when the effect of the collar plate width and the collar plate location on smax were compared it could be said that the most effective parameter was the collar plate location in fig 16 the variation between smax d and frd was depicted for two different values of hc y0 if the collar plate was placed on the seabed the scour was less than the second location of the collar plate hc y0 when the collar plate was located on the seabed local scour around pile decreased between 70 and 75 for w d 3 48 55 for w d 2 and 52 for w d 1 5 therefore if the collar plate was located on the pile which hc y0 is 0 5 local scour around the pile decreased between 28 and 55 for w d 3 27 55 for w d 2 and 28 for w d 1 5 as seen in fig 16 smax d is also based on the collar plate width when hc y0 was 0 on the seabed smax d decreased with the collar plate width increasing additionally if the collar plate width decreased w d 2 and w d 1 5 the values of smax d were approximately equaled for the same frd if the effect of the collar plate which hc y0 was 0 5 on local scour around the pile was considered it was seen that maximum scour occurred for the collar plate which had the minimum width w d 1 5 for w d 3 and w d 2 the values of smax d were almost equaled for this reason it could be said that the effect of the collar plate width on scour was stable after w d 2 when the collar plate location was hc y0 0 5 in table 5 smax and reductions due to using the collar plate were shown for all tests reduction r was calculated as follows 21 r s m a x s m a x c s m a x where smax and smaxc define the maximum scour depth in proximity to the pile without the collar plate and a pile with a collar plate respectively in fig 17 final scour profiles are shown for all cases when propeller speed is 840 rpm as seen in fig 17 downstream of the scour profiles in figs 17a and c shows similarity in terms of forming ripples due to fine seabed sediment because of the collar plate at 5 cm above the seabed the downflow was prevented to reach to the seabed and the jet flow of propeller had a dominant role on scour such as unconfined the seabed no pile on the other hand when the collar plate was placed on the seabed the scour profile at downstream of pile was similar to the scour profile occurred in case 2 because the wake vortices were effective in forming the seabed profile at downstream of the pile although figs 17b and d were not exactly similar they were similar in terms of their shapes and the location of the deposit zone to understand the effect of the collar plate on scour around a pile the seabed profile was measured along the lateral direction in the axis of the pile in fig 18 three different seabed profiles for propeller speed of 840 rpm were shown the collar plate location and the collar plate width were effective on changing of the seabed profiles but it was obviously seen that using the collar plate reduced the scour depth and the scour hole width bmax in fig 19 the variations of the relative scour hole length lp dp with frd were shown the longest lp dp formed for case 1 the values of lp dp for case 1 were between 7 and 10 the existence of a pile caused reducing of lp dp with respect to lp dp formed for case 1 when a pile was placed to obstruct propeller flow the values of lp dp were between 6 and 7 but when the collar plate was mounted on the pile above 0 05 m from the seabed hc y0 0 5 the values of lp dp for w d 2 and w d 3 were shorter than the values of lp dp occurred in case 2 on the other hand the value of lp dp was almost the same for w d 1 5 in case 2 corresponding to the same frd as mentioned before it means that distance between the deposition mound and the pile decreased however if the collar plate was placed on the seabed level the values of lp dp were longer than the values of lp dp occurred in case 2 for all the collar plates the values of lp dp were between 7 and 8 5 and they were closer to the values of lp dp measured for case 1 it also could be said that the distance between the deposition mound and the pile increased using collar plate to reduce the scour around a pier was studied several times in previous studies considering steady channel flow alabi 2006 mashahir et al 2004 and tafarojnoruz et al 2012 stated that a collar delayed the development of the scour hole it was found that since a collar reduces the scour rate when tests are performed to determine effect of collars on scouring around a pier test duration should be much longer with respect to tests for pier without a collar to reach the equilibrium condition alabi 2006 also declared that erroneous results may be obtained if tests are completed earlier than the time to reach equilibrium state the experimental results presented so far were obtained after 7 h since the experiments are completed before reaching the equilibrium state present study can be considered as a short term study although the propeller water jet and the steady channel flow characteristics differ from each other using collar plate may delay the development of scour hole due to propeller water jet increasing the duration to reach the equilibrium condition can be considered as an advantage of using collars however the efficiency of the collar in long term tests is unclear due to short term tests which is performed in this study 3 7 discussion on the effect of collar plates on scour which induces twin propeller jet around a pile cui et al 2020 and yew et al 2017 investigated scour mechanism of twin propeller for unconfined conditions cui et al 2020 performed their tests for two different rotating directions of twin propellers twin propellers were divided into two types called internal rotating and external rotating twin propellers according to the rotation direction of propellers looking at the propellers from stern the propeller on the right side rotates clockwise it was called as external rotating twin propeller ecrtp the opposite was called as internal rotating twin propeller icrtp cui et al 2020 reported that ecrtp produced the two maximum scour holes but icrtp caused only one maximum scour hole the maximum scour depth of icrtp is occurred on the symmetrical plane of the propeller however the maximum scour depth of ecrtp does not occur at the position of the central axis of the two propellers but along the rotational axis of the two propellers a ridge forms on the symmetrical plane between the two maximum scouring depths yew et al 2017 also conducted experiments with ecrtp defined by cui et al 2020 they showed similarly with cui et al 2020 that a merged scour profile could form depending on c dp and rotation speed rpm for detailed information see the cui et al 2020 and yew et al 2017 if twin propeller water jet is confined with a pile two different scour profiles can be observed considering the location of pile and the rotation direction of propellers if a pile is located at the position of the central axis of the two propellers scour around pile can increase due to the interaction between twin propeller water jet and pile similarly scour which occurs around a pile due to single propeller water jet the location of deposition mound would form in closer region on the other hand if a pile located on the symmetrical plane of icrtp scour depth occurred at upstream of the pile increases and distance between the deposition mound and the pile would be closer if the collar proposed in this study is used around the pile it is thought that the scour depths occurred around the pile because of twin propellers water jet decrease it is anticipated that placing the collar at seabed level would be more effective by reducing scour depth around a pile 4 conclusions laboratory experiments to reduce the local scour around a pile due to a propeller wash were conducted with three different collar plate widths two different the collar plate positions in vertical direction and three different propeller speeds in a water tank this study focused on the effect of the collar plate on reducing the scour around a pile tests conducted for different cases were not continued until equilibrium conditions since as shown for case 1 most of the scour depth occurred at the end of the 7 h test for this reason results of this study may be valid for short term analysis however the efficiency of the collar plate in long term tests is uncertain considering the results of this study on the other hand it is considered that the results show the effect of using collar plates are useful to reduce the scour depths due to propeller jet around the pile for short duration tests the conclusions of short term analysis are as follows 1 maximum scour depths for all cases case 1 case 2 case 3 increase with propeller speed increment 2 when the predicted scour depths by using proposed formulas in previous studies and the measured scour depths were compared it was determined that the differences between them resulted from the different test conditions propeller diameter dp propeller offset height y0 rotation speed rpm and sand diameter dn50 are of great importance on scour the sand diameter used in this study is generally finer than those used in previous studies penna et al 2019 hamill 1988 hamill et al 1999 tan and yüksel 2018 since the sand diameter used by hong et al 2013 was compatible with this study the best agreement was obtained between the measured scour depths in present study and calculated scour depths by using formula proposed by hong et al 2013 3 in case 2 local scour depths smax around a pile are larger than in case 1 and case 3 due to obstruction effect of pile without using the collar plate 4 using the collar plate causes the reduction of smax and changing the seabed profiles due to propeller jet if they are compared with respect to the location of the collar plate it can be said that when the collar plate is located on the seabed hc y0 0 reduction of smax is larger than reduction occurred when the collar plate is located on pile hc y0 0 5 the location of the collar plate affects formation of the seabed profiles when it is located on the seabed level distance between the peak height of the deposition mound and the rear side of pile increases at downstream of the pile however if the collar plate is placed in its second position hc y0 0 5 the peak height of the deposition mound occurs closer to rear side of the pile 5 the width of the collar plate is one of the most important parameters for reducing of scour generally it can be said that smax decreases by increasing the collar plate width this result is compatible with results obtained from experiments carried out to reduce scour around bridge piers by using the collar plates on the other hand if the collar plate is on the seabed level the collar plate width is more effective on reducing scour also if the collar plate is on the second position while smax is almost same for w d 2 and w d 3 smax is deeper for w d 1 5 it can be said that local scour is based on the effect of jet diffusion for wider collar plates on the other hand as the width of the collar plate decreases the downflow due to obstruction of the pile is getting to be effective on scour besides the jet diffusion 6 the effect of the parameters such as propeller diameter pile location pile diameter sediment diameter kept constant in this study on scour around a pile should be investigated by experimental studies in order to understand the effect of the collar plate on scour around a pile therefore test duration has a significant importance on scouring around a pile with collar plate tests may be performed much longer to understand collar plate effect on scour around a pile under propeller water jet thus the test results can be used to obtain formulas that estimate the depth of scour in case of collar plates credit authorship contribution statement kubilay cihan conceptualization methodology investigation writing original draft

20604,the pipeline spanning is triggered by the unevenness of the seabed the cyclic fatigue loadings from the subsequent scouring make the spanning pipeline be prone to be fatigue failure which can cause the loss of pipeline integrity and even catastrophic accident however probabilistic modeling of a free spanning subsea pipeline fatigue failure is a challenging task due to its dynamic characteristics and uncertain information this paper proposes a dynamic probabilistic methodology that could capture the uncertainty and time dependence of the fatigue failure scenario of free spanning subsea pipelines dynamic bayesian network dbn is adopted to develop the accident scenario by finding the fatigue failure causations and derived events the probabilities of basic causations are estimated by fuzzy set and evidence theory considering their uncertain characteristics the established model can capture the dynamic fatigue accumulation of pipelines over their entire service life and assess the dynamic probability of fatigue failure at different time slices besides the most credible causations of fatigue failure can be figured out due to the diagnostic ability of the model a real field case study is used to demonstrate the application of different steps of the developed methodology it is observed that the methodology can be a useful tool to analyze dynamic fatigue failure risk of spanning subsea pipelines keywords subsea pipelines fatigue failure dynamic bayesian network probabilistic assessment 1 introduction subsea pipelines play an important role in the transportation of hydrocarbon resources arzaghi et al 2017 however a huge gap is usually formed between the subsea pipelines and the surface of the seabed due to the unevenness of the seabed the erosion of the seabed by the current etc and this is called free spanning pipeline when the current flows through the spanning pipelines the vortex would be formed behind the pipelines and released at a certain frequency due to the changes of the surrounding pressure the release of the vortex could cause the periodic vibration of the spanning pipe section which is vortex induced vibration viv the long term viv action on subsea pipelines would cause fatigue accumulation resulting in the loss of pipeline integrity which in turn causes serious economic losses and pollution to the marine environment for example in october 2000 after the twice attack of the typhoon the pipelines spanning was formed at the subsea pipeline of the ping hu oil and gas field in the east china sea due to the rapid current which caused a quick failure of subsea pipeline the oil and gas field was forced to stop production for 178 days causing economic losses of more than 20 million rmb he et al 2009 engineering investigations confirmed that the presence of pipeline span is dynamic some pipelines may be re buried by the transported sediment or may continue to be eroded by the current to form the larger span which increases the challenge of fatigue failure assessment of spanning pipeline zhu and chen 2009 therefore a dynamic risk assessment of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline is important to ensure the safe operation of subsea pipelines currently modeling and assessment of fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipelines attracted a lot of attention shabani et al 2017 used the failure probability theory to estimate the reliability of the spanning subsea pipeline and analyzed the safety level shabani et al 2019 used monte carlo sampling to train the artificial neural network for estimating the fatigue failure probability of subsea pipelines due to viv sollund et al 2016 studied the fatigue damage caused by waves in multi span pipelines rezazadeh et al 2010 proposed a viv fatigue analysis method for subsea span pipelines based on viv analysis and obtained the stress distribution and the natural frequency of each vibration mode for spanning pipeline using abaqus code gazis 2012 conducted a probabilistic assessment of subsea pipeline affected by waves through the monte carlo simulations pontaza and menon 2010 predicted the response of free spans exposed to sea bottom currents based on fluid structure interaction coupled a three dimensional viscous incompressible navier stokes solver with a nonlinear beam finite element solver van den abeele et al 2013 proposed a numerical framework to predict free spans that is susceptible to fatigue damage dnv rp f105 2006 issued a recommended method for fatigue analysis of the subsea pipeline although the abovementioned studies made great progress on fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipelines there are still some remained issues that are the focuses of the current study most previous studies on fatigue failure of spanning pipelines focused on simulating the viv process and solving the vibration frequency the fatigue failure of spanning pipelines is mainly studied from the aspects of fatigue life estimation pipeline response under viv and structure reliability of subsea pipeline however few researchers studied the fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipelines from a risk perspective by identifying the causations causing fatigue failure of spanning pipelines the decisions to ensure the structural integrity of pipeline and extend pipeline life can be made efficiently thus the fatigue failure of a spanning pipeline can be assessed from a probabilistic perspective based on a cause consequence evolution model the past years have seen a number of efforts made on risk and reliability assessment of subsea pipelines kawsar et al 2015 arzaghi et al 2017 2018 2018 li et al 2019 jiang and dong 2020 risk analysis of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline is challenged due to the lack of data besides the static nature of the conventional cause consequence model will introduce uncertainty in risk analysis thus a model that can capture the uncertainties associated with the available data and the dynamic nature of the fatigue failure of the pipeline due to the damage accumulation over time is urgently required bayesian network bn is a graphical reasoning probabilistic technique and widely used in risk analysis of offshore oil and gas facilities due to its excellent performance in handling uncertainties related to various states dependencies and common cause failure of system variables arzaghi et al 2017 baksh et al 2018 chang et al 2019a b li et al 2019 however bn cannot account for the time dependence which can be considered by dbn as an extension of bn it not only inherits the probability deduction function to solve the uncertainty but can obtain dynamic characteristics of the system at different time slices thus dbn can be used to capture the dynamic characteristics of fatigue failure accumulation over time chang et al 2019a b hashemi et al 2015 rebello et al 2018 ramírez and utne 2015 in the present study dbn is utilized to handle the uncertainties in modelling fatigue failure of spanning pipelines in addition qra quantitative risk assessment of a pipeline is also challenged by insufficient or even missing data which can be addressed using fuzzy set theory and evidence theory implemented with expert elicitation he et al 2018 this study aims to develop a dynamic methodology for probabilistic assessment of fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipelines it can consider the dynamic characteristics of fatigue failure of pipeline and the uncertain information for this purpose dbn is used to establish the fatigue failure scenario of spanning pipeline to capture the interdependence of basic causations and the dynamic accumulation of pipeline fatigue failure fuzzy set theory and evidence theory are employed to estimate the occurrence probabilities of failure causations considering uncertain information the outcomes of this study can help to understand fatigue failure as a function of time and the most probable causations contributing to fatigue failure the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology framework of probabilistic fatigue failure assessment of spanning pipeline while section 3 gives a case study to illustrate the methodology section 4 presents the conclusions of this paper 2 the developed methodology the proposed framework of dynamic probabilistic fatigue failure assessment of free spanning subsea pipelines is shown in fig 1 the main steps are as follows 1 identifying risk factors of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline during its service life 2 dynamic quantitative fatigue failure scenario modeling using dbn 3 probabilities estimation of basic causations of fatigue failure 4 dynamic probability analysis of pipeline fatigue failure 2 1 step 1 identifying risk factors of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline the first step aims to identify risk factors contributing to fatigue failure of spanning pipelines and it is a critical step of the methodology in this step the pipeline and environmental information e g service time material buried depth soil historical inspection reports ocean current and wave et al are collected chang et al 2019a b through integrating this information the factors causing fatigue failure of spanning pipeline are identified moreover the variables representing the states of safety and performance of pipeline can be determined based on the fatigue failure mechanism 2 2 step 2 dynamic quantitative modeling of fatigue failure based on risk factors and their interdependencies in step 1 the fatigue failure scenario can be built by dbn considering the time dependence of basic causations dbn is an extension of conventional bn and it can overcome the limitations of conventional bn in time independent characteristics dbn adds the time dimension to bn which makes it capture not only the static dependence relations among variables but also the dependence relations along the time dimension zhao et al 2020 dbn can be interpreted as a generalization of markov process models and it was commonly applied for the modeling of deterioration any node in the time slice only depends on its parent node at the same time slice and the similar nodes sliced in the adjacent time slice dbn model in this paper is a general form of a two time slice bn which expands the number of time slices from 2 to n and its joint probability can be defined by eq 1 khakzad et al 2017 1 p x 1 t t 1 t i 1 n p x i t p a x i t where x i t is the ith node at time t i 1 2 n and p a x i t is the parents of x i t in the networks this study attempts to use dbn to model and assess the fatigue failure of a spanning pipeline a special type of dbn that is a two time slice bns of fatigue failure is presented in fig 2 for the illustrative purpose in the two time slice bn the time dimension is discretized into time slices the current time slice is represented by t 1 and the next time slice is represented by t the critical factors leading to the fatigue failure of the free spanning subsea pipeline are low fatigue resistance f1 and accumulation of fatigue f2 since viv caused by ocean current has a continuous impact on the subsea pipeline the fatigue failure of a pipeline is not only affected by the increasing vulnerability of pipeline due to degradation but also the cumulative fatigue caused by the long term viv which leads to a time varying accumulation of fatigue thus the accumulation of fatigue f2 under time slice t is affected by its state in the time slice t 1 similarly the fatigue failure of the spanning pipeline is only affected by f1 and f2 in the same time slice but also influenced by its state in the time slice t 1 in this way two bns are integrated and form a dbn with two time slices the dependency relationship between two similar nodes in an adjacent time slice is represented by a transition probability table the conditional relationship among pipeline fatigue failure variables can be determined based on their actual interactions in reality 2 3 step 3 probability estimation of basic causations the calculation of fatigue failure probability of spanning pipelines requires the probabilities of basic causations however the data for determining the probabilities of basic causations are usually limited or missing data this step uses fuzzy set theory and evidence theory implemented with expert elicitation to estimate the probabilities of basic causations fuzzy set theory is suitable to calculate the probabilities of basic causations with subjective and imprecise knowledge while evidence theory is suitable to estimate the probabilities of basic causations with incomplete and ignorant knowledge these two techniques are briefly described as follows 2 3 1 fuzzy set theory fuzzy set theory can convert qualitative knowledge or judgment into quantified numerical reasoning expert language judgment is generally fuzzy and subjective and fuzzy numbers are used to relax this limitation fuzzy numbers are divided into triangular fuzzy numbers tfn and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers zfn ferdous et al 2011 yazdi et al 2019 in this paper tfn is utilized to describe expert judgment language firstly the language expression of the expert opinion is divided into very low vl low l fairly low fl medium m fairly high fh high h and very high vh the expert opinions at different levels will be converted into fuzzy numbers according to a certain rule considering different experts opinions the weighted average method is used to summarize the judgments of multiple experts as shown in eq 2 li et al 2018 2 p i j 1 m w j p i j j 1 m w j where p i represents the aggregated fuzzy number of input event i p i j represents the fuzzy number of input event i from expert j w j is the weight of expert j and m represents the number of experts subsequently fuzzy probability score fps of the aggregated fuzzy numbers can be obtained by calculating the left and right fuzzy set scores as shown in eq 3 yazdi and kabir 2017 3 f p s p i f p s r i g h t p i 1 f p s l e f t p i 2 eventually fps is converted into failure probability by using eqs 4 and 5 li et al 2018 ferdous et al 2012 which is used for further quantitative analysis 4 p f i 1 10 k 5 k 2 301 1 f p s f p s 1 3 2 3 2 evidence theory evidence theory is mostly used to solve the uncertainty problem caused by ignorance conflict and incomplete information ferdous et al 2012 li et al 2018 it considers ignorance and conflict with a belief structure and then integrate the opinions of multiple experts this method assigns the subjective probability to the corresponding subset of the power set and the unassigned probability to an ignorant subset there are three basic parameters in belief structure to express uncertainty for example basic probability allocation bpa belief measure bel and plausibility measure pl a basic set of foundations is called the frame of discernment fod fod is a set of mutually exclusive parameters there are 2ω subsets in the power set p and ω is the cardinality of the set in this paper the state of input event a includes success s and failure f therefore the uncertainty in the input event can be characterized by a fod u s f containing four subsets i e φ s f s f in which φ is a null set s and f mean the two states of a system and the last subset s f accounts for the ignorance of an expert s knowledge which arises due to incomplete and lacking information about a system ferdous et al 2012 bpa provides the probability for each subset in power set by experts denoted as m a which can be characterized by eq 6 li et al 2018 6 m a 0 1 m φ 0 a ω m a 1 the knowledge of multi experts is summarized by ds rules for example it is assumed that there are two bpas m1 a and m2 b from two sources of evidence then normalize by ds rules according to eqs 7 and 8 dutta 2015 7 m 1 2 c 1 k a b m 1 a m 2 b 8 k a b m 1 a m 2 b bel a and pl a of the event a can be calculated by eqs 9 and 10 he et al 2018 forming a confidence interval bel a pl a which represents the confirmation of a certain hypothesis degree the static failure probability of event a is the median value of the confidence interval bel pl 9 b e l a b a m a m x f 10 p l b a φ m b m x f m x s f 2 4 step 4 dynamic probability assessment of fatigue failure the probabilities of the basic causations obtained in step 3 are used as the inputs of the dbn model to estimate the fatigue failure probability of spanning pipelines the main advantage of bn making it a superior risk analysis method for dynamic systems such as pipeline fatigue failure is the ability to perform probability updating i e diagnostic analysis bn can update the prior probabilities of variables using bayes theorem when new evidence is observed rendering updated or posterior probabilities as shown in eq 11 the accident or failure of a system is usually used as evidence dbn as an extension of bn also has the ability of diagnostic analysis 11 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e based on the diagnostic capabilities of the dbn model the prior probabilities and the posterior probabilities of basic causations are compared to capture the most probable causes of pipeline fatigue failure the above is the dbn based dynamic probability assessment framework for fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipelines it can be utilized to predict the probability of pipeline fatigue failure accident and find out the most probable causations to prepare management and control strategies currently there are lots of previous studies about assessing fatigue failure of spanning pipeline through experimental and numerical approaches these publications mainly focused on structural damage strength and remaining life of pipelines this paper establishes a probabilistic assessment model for fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipeline using a dbn based cause consequence model i e fatigue failure is assessed from a probabilistic perspective the results can be used to support efficient risk management of spanning subsea pipelines the development of the dbn model considers the physical fatigue failure mechanisms and it is reflected in determining the logical dependence among the identified failure nodes the probabilities of basic causations are mainly extracted from experts opinions since the available data for them are usually limited or missing thus the proposed methodology is suitable for risk assessment under uncertainty in the case with limited or missing data the model can continuously update the assessment results when the new inspection data are available 3 methodology application case study 3 1 developing pipeline fatigue failure scenario this section uses a case study to illustrate this methodology through the collected information from literature expert experiences and historical inspection reports basic causations for fatigue failure of spanning pipelines are identified and presented in table 1 through the analysis of basic causations it is observed that fatigue failure of spanning pipelines mainly results from the low fatigue resistance of pipeline and the continuous accumulation of fatigue damage among them the low fatigue resistance of pipeline is caused by corrosion welding defects damage during pipeline construction and buckling et al on the other hand the accumulation of fatigue damage of pipeline is mainly due to the longtime viv in addition the accumulation of fatigue damage lacks effective governance capabilities the accumulation of fatigue damage will lead to an increase in the probability of fatigue failure based on the identified causations and pipeline fatigue failure mechanism the dbn model based fatigue failure scenario of spanning subsea pipelines is established as shown in fig 3 in which the nodes i e pipeline corrosion pipeline damage initial crack initial span insufficient burial depth and accumulation of fatigue are determined as the self circulation nodes the dynamic changes of these nodes are expressed by multi layer bns as claimed in section 2 2 the conditional relationship among nodes in the dbn model of fatigue failure is determined based on their actual interactions in reality conditional probability table cpt represents the mathematical transition relationship from one node to others an example of cpt among intermediate node pipeline damage and leaf node improper maintenance third party activity in dbn is shown in table 2 the state of a node is defined as yes and no yes means the occurrence of the state of an event while no means the absence of an event in table 2 both improper maintenance and third party activity are in a yes state pipeline damage has a likelihood of 0 98 for the occurrence while there still is a likelihood of 0 02 for the absence considering the uncertainty in the conditional dependencies among nodes the cpt can be determined based on statistical data and experts experience similarly when improper maintenance is in the yes state while third party activity is in the no state pipeline damage has a likelihood of 0 9 for the occurrence and a likelihood of 0 1 for the absence 3 2 probability estimation of basic causations for the scarce data sources the basic causations for fatigue failures of spanning pipelines can be divided into two categories 1 basic causations with subjective and imprecise knowledge 2 the basic causations with incomplete and ignorant knowledge they are dealt with by fuzzy set theory and evidence theory respectively which is presented in table 1 then three experts from the university oil company and safety institute respectively are invited to evaluate the probability of these basic causations table 3 presents the detailed information of the invited experts for the first type of basic causations the opinions from experts are characterized by fuzzy numbers and the method described in 2 3 1 is utilized to integrate expert opinions based on different weights to calculate the probabilities of the basic causations table 4 presents the expert opinions and the estimated probabilities of basic causations for the second type of basic causations evidence theory and ds rules are utilized to summarize the opinions of multiple experts to estimate the probability of basic causations with incomplete or ignorant knowledge incomplete knowledge in evidence theory is considered to be a kind of ignorance which has characteristics of uncertainty and is distributed on a power set with an unassigned mass expert knowledge is shown in table 4 the probabilities of basic causations are calculated by the method described in 2 3 2 table 5 presents the multi expert knowledge bel pl and the probabilities of basic causations 3 3 dynamic probability analysis of pipeline fatigue failure based on the developed dbn model the dynamical fatigue failure probability of spanning pipeline during its service time is assessed as mentioned in section 2 dbn accounts for the time dependence of nodes and it can capture the dependence relations of a variable along the time dimension a variable under time slice t is affected by its state in the time slice t 1 as presented in the joint probability function i e eq 1 this characteristic of dbn is used to extract the dynamic fatigue failure probability of spanning pipeline the basic causation probabilities estimated in 3 2 are inputted into the dbn model fig 4 presents the dynamic probabilities of fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipeline and fig 5 shows the dynamic occurrence probabilities of partial fatigue failure causations that are dynamic nodes identified in the dbn model 20 time slices i e 20 years are set according to the average service period of subsea pipelines which is used to describe the entire service period of subsea pipelines it can be seen from fig 4 that the fatigue failure probability of spanning pipelines gradually increases during the entire service period the initial probability of pipeline fatigue failure is 1 52e 02 and it increases to 1 17e 01 after the fatigue accumulation of 20 years at the initial use stage of the pipeline the probability of fatigue failure increases year by year due to the hydrodynamic loadings and the accumulation of fatigue damage the degree of fatigue damage gradually reached the tolerable limit of the pipeline at the beginning of the pipeline operation the monitoring of fatigue failure of the pipeline should be strengthened and efficient measures should be taken in the middle and later stages of pipeline operation to reduce the fatigue damage degree or extending the service time of the pipeline in the established dbn model pipelines corrosion pipelines damage initial crack initial span and insufficient burial depth are dynamic which are self circulation nodes through the dbn model reasoning the probabilities of these factors in 20 time slices are obtained it is noted that in fig 5 the left ordinate axis represents the probability of pipelines corrosion pipelines damage initial crack insufficient burial depth and the right ordinate axis represents the probability of initial span the probabilities of dynamic risk factors increase over the year and gradually reaches a plateau in the 13th year which meets the phenomenon that fatigue failure probability gradually reaches a limit in the later operation period of the pipeline among these five dynamic risk factors the probability of initial span has the fastest growth rate it increases from 5 09e 03 to 7 42e 02 the cumulative fatigue damage of subsea pipelines is classified into three levels i e slight moderate and severe as can be seen from fig 6 the cumulative fatigue damage probability of severe fatigue increases from 0 0206 to 0 2226 the cumulative fatigue damage probability of moderate fatigue increases from 0 0203 to 0 3131 however the cumulative damage of slight fatigue decreases from 0 9594 to 0 4616 this is consistent with the cumulative process of fatigue damage of subsea pipelines in the past 20 years the slight fatigue failure probability gradually decreased with the accumulation of damage the harsh ocean environment made the probability of moderate and severe increase over the subsequent years 3 4 diagnostic analysis to identify critical fatigue failure causations the diagnostic analysis is a backward reasoning method which is an important function in the dbn model the most probable risk factors could be identified through diagnostic analysis techniques to provide some targeted suggestions for planning safety measures through the diagnostic analysis technique the 20th time slice is used as evidence to calculate the posterior probability of basic causations at different time slices in the dbn model the posterior probability of the 20th time slice is compared with the prior probability the causations with high posterior probability or probability change are the most probable factors in the fatigue damage of spanning pipelines the comparison between the prior probability and the posterior probability of basic causations obtained through diagnostic analysis is shown in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 the basic causations with the most obvious increase in probability are x2 initial crack x4 third party activities x5 corrosion x8 seabed change x9 high pressure of conveying medium and x16 insufficient burial depth which means that these causations are the most probable factors for pipeline fatigue failure accidents based on the diagnostic analysis several preventive measures should be implemented to reduce the probability of fatigue failure of spanning pipelines which are as follows 1 selecting high quality materials of pipelines and inspecting pipeline cracks and corrosion timely 2 strengthening the management of offshore operations to reduce third party activities around pipeline 3 planning an optimal inspection interval of spanning pipeline 4 installing anti viv device to reduce fatigue damage 5 conducting the design installation operation and maintenance of pipelines accordance with the regulatory requirements 3 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a method that changes the input parameters of the model to cause the output to change within an appropriate range this method can help verify the robustness of the dbn model in this paper the changes in the probabilities of fatigue failure of spanning pipelines are observed by adjusting the probabilities of critical factors by 10 and the results are shown in fig 8 fig 8 a takes the critical causations x2 x4 x5 x8 x9 x16 as examples and after changing critical events probabilities by 10 the changes in the probability of fatigue failure of spanning pipelines are obtained fig 8 a presents that the change of fatigue failure probability of spanning pipelines due to the change of x16 is the largest the probability of fatigue failure corresponding to a reduction of 10 is 0 01513 and the probability of fatigue failure corresponding to an increase of 10 is 0 01523 it shows that x16 is an important causation leading to the fatigue failure of spanning pipelines which corresponds to the results in the diagnostic analysis in addition it can be seen that changes in the probabilities of other causations can cause the probability of fatigue failure to change within an acceptable range thus the effectiveness of the dbn model can be illustrated fig 8 b presents the change of fatigue failure probability results from the change of other basic causations it is assumed that the probability of the critical causations x16 increases to 110 the probability of fatigue failure of spanning pipelines increases from 0 01518 to 0 01523 when the probabilities of critical causations x5 and x16 increase to 110 the probability of fatigue failure increases from 0 01523 to 0 01524 when the probabilities of critical causations x4 x5 and x16 were increased to 110 the probability of fatigue failure increases from 0 01524 to 0 01525 when the probabilities of critical causations x2 x4 x5 and x16 were increased to 110 the probability of fatigue failure increases from 0 01525 to 0 01526 when the probabilities of critical causations x2 x4 x5 x9 x16 increase to 110 the probability of fatigue failure increases from 0 01526 to 0 01527 furthermore when the probabilities of critical events x2 x4 x5 x8 x9 and x16 increase to 110 the probability of fatigue failure increases from 0 01527 to 0 01529 the probabilities decrease in critical causations will lead to a decrease in fatigue failure probability within a reasonable range 4 conclusions in this paper a probabilistic methodology for fatigue failure assessment of spanning subsea pipeline is proposed fatigue failure scenario is constructed by identifying the risk factors associated with fatigue failure and the relationship among them fuzzy set theory and evidence theory are employed to handle the data uncertainties resulting from subjectivity and incompleteness while estimating the probabilities of basic causations dbn is used to capture the uncertainties and time dependence of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline the proposed methodology can perform a real time assessment of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline besides the results can be updated when new observations are available the advantage of the methodology over previous techniques used for a similar purpose can be summarized as follows this methodology can cope with the data uncertainty and be suitable for risk assessment of the cases with limited or missing data compared to the conventional fatigue damage assessment of spanning pipeline this methodology can capture the dynamic characteristics of fatigue failure by considering the time dependence of fatigue causations dynamic fatigue failure probability of spanning subsea pipeline over its service life can be derived considering the effect of fatigue damage accumulation the proposed model is applied to a spanning subsea pipeline by analyzing the fatigue failure of the pipeline it is determined that pipelines corrosion pipelines damage initial crack initial span insufficient burial depth and accumulation of fatigue are self circulation nodes the fatigue failure probability of spanning pipelines increases over the year the analysis results of dynamic failure probability can support the safety management of spanning pipelines through diagnostic analysis a total of 6 critical causations leading to fatigue failure were identified the comparison of the prior and the posterior probability presented that third party activities seabed change high pressure of conveying medium and insufficient burial depth are the most probable factors causing fatigue failure the corresponding measures should be adopted to reduce the probability of fatigue failure of spanning pipelines in addition the robustness of this model is verified by the sensitivity analysis which reflects the applicability of the model to dynamic probability assessment the uniqueness of this paper is an attempt to study the fatigue failure of spanning pipeline from a probabilistic perspective the model could help to identify the most probable causations of fatigue failure and predict the dynamic evolution of spanning pipeline fatigue failure over its service period the methodology can support risk assessment and management of subsea pipelines and other offshore facilities subjected to fatigue failure the limitation is that the present work simplifies the correlation among different basic causations future work is planned to integrate copula function and dbn to better handle the correlation and dependence among basic accident causations besides a data driven model can also be developed to predict fatigue damage of spanning pipeline through the data obtained from experiments credit authorship contribution statement xinhong li methodology writing original draft design drafting paper

failure risk of spanning subsea pipelines keywords subsea pipelines fatigue failure dynamic bayesian network probabilistic assessment 1 introduction subsea pipelines play an important role in the transportation of hydrocarbon resources arzaghi et al 2017 however a huge gap is usually formed between the subsea pipelines and the surface of the seabed due to the unevenness of the seabed the erosion of the seabed by the current etc and this is called free spanning pipeline when the current flows through the spanning pipelines the vortex would be formed behind the pipelines and released at a certain frequency due to the changes of the surrounding pressure the release of the vortex could cause the periodic vibration of the spanning pipe section which is vortex induced vibration viv the long term viv action on subsea pipelines would cause fatigue accumulation resulting in the loss of pipeline integrity which in turn causes serious economic losses and pollution to the marine environment for example in october 2000 after the twice attack of the typhoon the pipelines spanning was formed at the subsea pipeline of the ping hu oil and gas field in the east china sea due to the rapid current which caused a quick failure of subsea pipeline the oil and gas field was forced to stop production for 178 days causing economic losses of more than 20 million rmb he et al 2009 engineering investigations confirmed that the presence of pipeline span is dynamic some pipelines may be re buried by the transported sediment or may continue to be eroded by the current to form the larger span which increases the challenge of fatigue failure assessment of spanning pipeline zhu and chen 2009 therefore a dynamic risk assessment of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline is important to ensure the safe operation of subsea pipelines currently modeling and assessment of fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipelines attracted a lot of attention shabani et al 2017 used the failure probability theory to estimate the reliability of the spanning subsea pipeline and analyzed the safety level shabani et al 2019 used monte carlo sampling to train the artificial neural network for estimating the fatigue failure probability of subsea pipelines due to viv sollund et al 2016 studied the fatigue damage caused by waves in multi span pipelines rezazadeh et al 2010 proposed a viv fatigue analysis method for subsea span pipelines based on viv analysis and obtained the stress distribution and the natural frequency of each vibration mode for spanning pipeline using abaqus code gazis 2012 conducted a probabilistic assessment of subsea pipeline affected by waves through the monte carlo simulations pontaza and menon 2010 predicted the response of free spans exposed to sea bottom currents based on fluid structure interaction coupled a three dimensional viscous incompressible navier stokes solver with a nonlinear beam finite element solver van den abeele et al 2013 proposed a numerical framework to predict free spans that is susceptible to fatigue damage dnv rp f105 2006 issued a recommended method for fatigue analysis of the subsea pipeline although the abovementioned studies made great progress on fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipelines there are still some remained issues that are the focuses of the current study most previous studies on fatigue failure of spanning pipelines focused on simulating the viv process and solving the vibration frequency the fatigue failure of spanning pipelines is mainly studied from the aspects of fatigue life estimation pipeline response under viv and structure reliability of subsea pipeline however few researchers studied the fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipelines from a risk perspective by identifying the causations causing fatigue failure of spanning pipelines the decisions to ensure the structural integrity of pipeline and extend pipeline life can be made efficiently thus the fatigue failure of a spanning pipeline can be assessed from a probabilistic perspective based on a cause consequence evolution model the past years have seen a number of efforts made on risk and reliability assessment of subsea pipelines kawsar et al 2015 arzaghi et al 2017 2018 2018 li et al 2019 jiang and dong 2020 risk analysis of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline is challenged due to the lack of data besides the static nature of the conventional cause consequence model will introduce uncertainty in risk analysis thus a model that can capture the uncertainties associated with the available data and the dynamic nature of the fatigue failure of the pipeline due to the damage accumulation over time is urgently required bayesian network bn is a graphical reasoning probabilistic technique and widely used in risk analysis of offshore oil and gas facilities due to its excellent performance in handling uncertainties related to various states dependencies and common cause failure of system variables arzaghi et al 2017 baksh et al 2018 chang et al 2019a b li et al 2019 however bn cannot account for the time dependence which can be considered by dbn as an extension of bn it not only inherits the probability deduction function to solve the uncertainty but can obtain dynamic characteristics of the system at different time slices thus dbn can be used to capture the dynamic characteristics of fatigue failure accumulation over time chang et al 2019a b hashemi et al 2015 rebello et al 2018 ramírez and utne 2015 in the present study dbn is utilized to handle the uncertainties in modelling fatigue failure of spanning pipelines in addition qra quantitative risk assessment of a pipeline is also challenged by insufficient or even missing data which can be addressed using fuzzy set theory and evidence theory implemented with expert elicitation he et al 2018 this study aims to develop a dynamic methodology for probabilistic assessment of fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipelines it can consider the dynamic characteristics of fatigue failure of pipeline and the uncertain information for this purpose dbn is used to establish the fatigue failure scenario of spanning pipeline to capture the interdependence of basic causations and the dynamic accumulation of pipeline fatigue failure fuzzy set theory and evidence theory are employed to estimate the occurrence probabilities of failure causations considering uncertain information the outcomes of this study can help to understand fatigue failure as a function of time and the most probable causations contributing to fatigue failure the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the methodology framework of probabilistic fatigue failure assessment of spanning pipeline while section 3 gives a case study to illustrate the methodology section 4 presents the conclusions of this paper 2 the developed methodology the proposed framework of dynamic probabilistic fatigue failure assessment of free spanning subsea pipelines is shown in fig 1 the main steps are as follows 1 identifying risk factors of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline during its service life 2 dynamic quantitative fatigue failure scenario modeling using dbn 3 probabilities estimation of basic causations of fatigue failure 4 dynamic probability analysis of pipeline fatigue failure 2 1 step 1 identifying risk factors of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline the first step aims to identify risk factors contributing to fatigue failure of spanning pipelines and it is a critical step of the methodology in this step the pipeline and environmental information e g service time material buried depth soil historical inspection reports ocean current and wave et al are collected chang et al 2019a b through integrating this information the factors causing fatigue failure of spanning pipeline are identified moreover the variables representing the states of safety and performance of pipeline can be determined based on the fatigue failure mechanism 2 2 step 2 dynamic quantitative modeling of fatigue failure based on risk factors and their interdependencies in step 1 the fatigue failure scenario can be built by dbn considering the time dependence of basic causations dbn is an extension of conventional bn and it can overcome the limitations of conventional bn in time independent characteristics dbn adds the time dimension to bn which makes it capture not only the static dependence relations among variables but also the dependence relations along the time dimension zhao et al 2020 dbn can be interpreted as a generalization of markov process models and it was commonly applied for the modeling of deterioration any node in the time slice only depends on its parent node at the same time slice and the similar nodes sliced in the adjacent time slice dbn model in this paper is a general form of a two time slice bn which expands the number of time slices from 2 to n and its joint probability can be defined by eq 1 khakzad et al 2017 1 p x 1 t t 1 t i 1 n p x i t p a x i t where x i t is the ith node at time t i 1 2 n and p a x i t is the parents of x i t in the networks this study attempts to use dbn to model and assess the fatigue failure of a spanning pipeline a special type of dbn that is a two time slice bns of fatigue failure is presented in fig 2 for the illustrative purpose in the two time slice bn the time dimension is discretized into time slices the current time slice is represented by t 1 and the next time slice is represented by t the critical factors leading to the fatigue failure of the free spanning subsea pipeline are low fatigue resistance f1 and accumulation of fatigue f2 since viv caused by ocean current has a continuous impact on the subsea pipeline the fatigue failure of a pipeline is not only affected by the increasing vulnerability of pipeline due to degradation but also the cumulative fatigue caused by the long term viv which leads to a time varying accumulation of fatigue thus the accumulation of fatigue f2 under time slice t is affected by its state in the time slice t 1 similarly the fatigue failure of the spanning pipeline is only affected by f1 and f2 in the same time slice but also influenced by its state in the time slice t 1 in this way two bns are integrated and form a dbn with two time slices the dependency relationship between two similar nodes in an adjacent time slice is represented by a transition probability table the conditional relationship among pipeline fatigue failure variables can be determined based on their actual interactions in reality 2 3 step 3 probability estimation of basic causations the calculation of fatigue failure probability of spanning pipelines requires the probabilities of basic causations however the data for determining the probabilities of basic causations are usually limited or missing data this step uses fuzzy set theory and evidence theory implemented with expert elicitation to estimate the probabilities of basic causations fuzzy set theory is suitable to calculate the probabilities of basic causations with subjective and imprecise knowledge while evidence theory is suitable to estimate the probabilities of basic causations with incomplete and ignorant knowledge these two techniques are briefly described as follows 2 3 1 fuzzy set theory fuzzy set theory can convert qualitative knowledge or judgment into quantified numerical reasoning expert language judgment is generally fuzzy and subjective and fuzzy numbers are used to relax this limitation fuzzy numbers are divided into triangular fuzzy numbers tfn and trapezoidal fuzzy numbers zfn ferdous et al 2011 yazdi et al 2019 in this paper tfn is utilized to describe expert judgment language firstly the language expression of the expert opinion is divided into very low vl low l fairly low fl medium m fairly high fh high h and very high vh the expert opinions at different levels will be converted into fuzzy numbers according to a certain rule considering different experts opinions the weighted average method is used to summarize the judgments of multiple experts as shown in eq 2 li et al 2018 2 p i j 1 m w j p i j j 1 m w j where p i represents the aggregated fuzzy number of input event i p i j represents the fuzzy number of input event i from expert j w j is the weight of expert j and m represents the number of experts subsequently fuzzy probability score fps of the aggregated fuzzy numbers can be obtained by calculating the left and right fuzzy set scores as shown in eq 3 yazdi and kabir 2017 3 f p s p i f p s r i g h t p i 1 f p s l e f t p i 2 eventually fps is converted into failure probability by using eqs 4 and 5 li et al 2018 ferdous et al 2012 which is used for further quantitative analysis 4 p f i 1 10 k 5 k 2 301 1 f p s f p s 1 3 2 3 2 evidence theory evidence theory is mostly used to solve the uncertainty problem caused by ignorance conflict and incomplete information ferdous et al 2012 li et al 2018 it considers ignorance and conflict with a belief structure and then integrate the opinions of multiple experts this method assigns the subjective probability to the corresponding subset of the power set and the unassigned probability to an ignorant subset there are three basic parameters in belief structure to express uncertainty for example basic probability allocation bpa belief measure bel and plausibility measure pl a basic set of foundations is called the frame of discernment fod fod is a set of mutually exclusive parameters there are 2ω subsets in the power set p and ω is the cardinality of the set in this paper the state of input event a includes success s and failure f therefore the uncertainty in the input event can be characterized by a fod u s f containing four subsets i e φ s f s f in which φ is a null set s and f mean the two states of a system and the last subset s f accounts for the ignorance of an expert s knowledge which arises due to incomplete and lacking information about a system ferdous et al 2012 bpa provides the probability for each subset in power set by experts denoted as m a which can be characterized by eq 6 li et al 2018 6 m a 0 1 m φ 0 a ω m a 1 the knowledge of multi experts is summarized by ds rules for example it is assumed that there are two bpas m1 a and m2 b from two sources of evidence then normalize by ds rules according to eqs 7 and 8 dutta 2015 7 m 1 2 c 1 k a b m 1 a m 2 b 8 k a b m 1 a m 2 b bel a and pl a of the event a can be calculated by eqs 9 and 10 he et al 2018 forming a confidence interval bel a pl a which represents the confirmation of a certain hypothesis degree the static failure probability of event a is the median value of the confidence interval bel pl 9 b e l a b a m a m x f 10 p l b a φ m b m x f m x s f 2 4 step 4 dynamic probability assessment of fatigue failure the probabilities of the basic causations obtained in step 3 are used as the inputs of the dbn model to estimate the fatigue failure probability of spanning pipelines the main advantage of bn making it a superior risk analysis method for dynamic systems such as pipeline fatigue failure is the ability to perform probability updating i e diagnostic analysis bn can update the prior probabilities of variables using bayes theorem when new evidence is observed rendering updated or posterior probabilities as shown in eq 11 the accident or failure of a system is usually used as evidence dbn as an extension of bn also has the ability of diagnostic analysis 11 p u e p u e p e p u e u p u e based on the diagnostic capabilities of the dbn model the prior probabilities and the posterior probabilities of basic causations are compared to capture the most probable causes of pipeline fatigue failure the above is the dbn based dynamic probability assessment framework for fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipelines it can be utilized to predict the probability of pipeline fatigue failure accident and find out the most probable causations to prepare management and control strategies currently there are lots of previous studies about assessing fatigue failure of spanning pipeline through experimental and numerical approaches these publications mainly focused on structural damage strength and remaining life of pipelines this paper establishes a probabilistic assessment model for fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipeline using a dbn based cause consequence model i e fatigue failure is assessed from a probabilistic perspective the results can be used to support efficient risk management of spanning subsea pipelines the development of the dbn model considers the physical fatigue failure mechanisms and it is reflected in determining the logical dependence among the identified failure nodes the probabilities of basic causations are mainly extracted from experts opinions since the available data for them are usually limited or missing thus the proposed methodology is suitable for risk assessment under uncertainty in the case with limited or missing data the model can continuously update the assessment results when the new inspection data are available 3 methodology application case study 3 1 developing pipeline fatigue failure scenario this section uses a case study to illustrate this methodology through the collected information from literature expert experiences and historical inspection reports basic causations for fatigue failure of spanning pipelines are identified and presented in table 1 through the analysis of basic causations it is observed that fatigue failure of spanning pipelines mainly results from the low fatigue resistance of pipeline and the continuous accumulation of fatigue damage among them the low fatigue resistance of pipeline is caused by corrosion welding defects damage during pipeline construction and buckling et al on the other hand the accumulation of fatigue damage of pipeline is mainly due to the longtime viv in addition the accumulation of fatigue damage lacks effective governance capabilities the accumulation of fatigue damage will lead to an increase in the probability of fatigue failure based on the identified causations and pipeline fatigue failure mechanism the dbn model based fatigue failure scenario of spanning subsea pipelines is established as shown in fig 3 in which the nodes i e pipeline corrosion pipeline damage initial crack initial span insufficient burial depth and accumulation of fatigue are determined as the self circulation nodes the dynamic changes of these nodes are expressed by multi layer bns as claimed in section 2 2 the conditional relationship among nodes in the dbn model of fatigue failure is determined based on their actual interactions in reality conditional probability table cpt represents the mathematical transition relationship from one node to others an example of cpt among intermediate node pipeline damage and leaf node improper maintenance third party activity in dbn is shown in table 2 the state of a node is defined as yes and no yes means the occurrence of the state of an event while no means the absence of an event in table 2 both improper maintenance and third party activity are in a yes state pipeline damage has a likelihood of 0 98 for the occurrence while there still is a likelihood of 0 02 for the absence considering the uncertainty in the conditional dependencies among nodes the cpt can be determined based on statistical data and experts experience similarly when improper maintenance is in the yes state while third party activity is in the no state pipeline damage has a likelihood of 0 9 for the occurrence and a likelihood of 0 1 for the absence 3 2 probability estimation of basic causations for the scarce data sources the basic causations for fatigue failures of spanning pipelines can be divided into two categories 1 basic causations with subjective and imprecise knowledge 2 the basic causations with incomplete and ignorant knowledge they are dealt with by fuzzy set theory and evidence theory respectively which is presented in table 1 then three experts from the university oil company and safety institute respectively are invited to evaluate the probability of these basic causations table 3 presents the detailed information of the invited experts for the first type of basic causations the opinions from experts are characterized by fuzzy numbers and the method described in 2 3 1 is utilized to integrate expert opinions based on different weights to calculate the probabilities of the basic causations table 4 presents the expert opinions and the estimated probabilities of basic causations for the second type of basic causations evidence theory and ds rules are utilized to summarize the opinions of multiple experts to estimate the probability of basic causations with incomplete or ignorant knowledge incomplete knowledge in evidence theory is considered to be a kind of ignorance which has characteristics of uncertainty and is distributed on a power set with an unassigned mass expert knowledge is shown in table 4 the probabilities of basic causations are calculated by the method described in 2 3 2 table 5 presents the multi expert knowledge bel pl and the probabilities of basic causations 3 3 dynamic probability analysis of pipeline fatigue failure based on the developed dbn model the dynamical fatigue failure probability of spanning pipeline during its service time is assessed as mentioned in section 2 dbn accounts for the time dependence of nodes and it can capture the dependence relations of a variable along the time dimension a variable under time slice t is affected by its state in the time slice t 1 as presented in the joint probability function i e eq 1 this characteristic of dbn is used to extract the dynamic fatigue failure probability of spanning pipeline the basic causation probabilities estimated in 3 2 are inputted into the dbn model fig 4 presents the dynamic probabilities of fatigue failure of spanning subsea pipeline and fig 5 shows the dynamic occurrence probabilities of partial fatigue failure causations that are dynamic nodes identified in the dbn model 20 time slices i e 20 years are set according to the average service period of subsea pipelines which is used to describe the entire service period of subsea pipelines it can be seen from fig 4 that the fatigue failure probability of spanning pipelines gradually increases during the entire service period the initial probability of pipeline fatigue failure is 1 52e 02 and it increases to 1 17e 01 after the fatigue accumulation of 20 years at the initial use stage of the pipeline the probability of fatigue failure increases year by year due to the hydrodynamic loadings and the accumulation of fatigue damage the degree of fatigue damage gradually reached the tolerable limit of the pipeline at the beginning of the pipeline operation the monitoring of fatigue failure of the pipeline should be strengthened and efficient measures should be taken in the middle and later stages of pipeline operation to reduce the fatigue damage degree or extending the service time of the pipeline in the established dbn model pipelines corrosion pipelines damage initial crack initial span and insufficient burial depth are dynamic which are self circulation nodes through the dbn model reasoning the probabilities of these factors in 20 time slices are obtained it is noted that in fig 5 the left ordinate axis represents the probability of pipelines corrosion pipelines damage initial crack insufficient burial depth and the right ordinate axis represents the probability of initial span the probabilities of dynamic risk factors increase over the year and gradually reaches a plateau in the 13th year which meets the phenomenon that fatigue failure probability gradually reaches a limit in the later operation period of the pipeline among these five dynamic risk factors the probability of initial span has the fastest growth rate it increases from 5 09e 03 to 7 42e 02 the cumulative fatigue damage of subsea pipelines is classified into three levels i e slight moderate and severe as can be seen from fig 6 the cumulative fatigue damage probability of severe fatigue increases from 0 0206 to 0 2226 the cumulative fatigue damage probability of moderate fatigue increases from 0 0203 to 0 3131 however the cumulative damage of slight fatigue decreases from 0 9594 to 0 4616 this is consistent with the cumulative process of fatigue damage of subsea pipelines in the past 20 years the slight fatigue failure probability gradually decreased with the accumulation of damage the harsh ocean environment made the probability of moderate and severe increase over the subsequent years 3 4 diagnostic analysis to identify critical fatigue failure causations the diagnostic analysis is a backward reasoning method which is an important function in the dbn model the most probable risk factors could be identified through diagnostic analysis techniques to provide some targeted suggestions for planning safety measures through the diagnostic analysis technique the 20th time slice is used as evidence to calculate the posterior probability of basic causations at different time slices in the dbn model the posterior probability of the 20th time slice is compared with the prior probability the causations with high posterior probability or probability change are the most probable factors in the fatigue damage of spanning pipelines the comparison between the prior probability and the posterior probability of basic causations obtained through diagnostic analysis is shown in fig 7 as can be seen from fig 7 the basic causations with the most obvious increase in probability are x2 initial crack x4 third party activities x5 corrosion x8 seabed change x9 high pressure of conveying medium and x16 insufficient burial depth which means that these causations are the most probable factors for pipeline fatigue failure accidents based on the diagnostic analysis several preventive measures should be implemented to reduce the probability of fatigue failure of spanning pipelines which are as follows 1 selecting high quality materials of pipelines and inspecting pipeline cracks and corrosion timely 2 strengthening the management of offshore operations to reduce third party activities around pipeline 3 planning an optimal inspection interval of spanning pipeline 4 installing anti viv device to reduce fatigue damage 5 conducting the design installation operation and maintenance of pipelines accordance with the regulatory requirements 3 5 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is a method that changes the input parameters of the model to cause the output to change within an appropriate range this method can help verify the robustness of the dbn model in this paper the changes in the probabilities of fatigue failure of spanning pipelines are observed by adjusting the probabilities of critical factors by 10 and the results are shown in fig 8 fig 8 a takes the critical causations x2 x4 x5 x8 x9 x16 as examples and after changing critical events probabilities by 10 the changes in the probability of fatigue failure of spanning pipelines are obtained fig 8 a presents that the change of fatigue failure probability of spanning pipelines due to the change of x16 is the largest the probability of fatigue failure corresponding to a reduction of 10 is 0 01513 and the probability of fatigue failure corresponding to an increase of 10 is 0 01523 it shows that x16 is an important causation leading to the fatigue failure of spanning pipelines which corresponds to the results in the diagnostic analysis in addition it can be seen that changes in the probabilities of other causations can cause the probability of fatigue failure to change within an acceptable range thus the effectiveness of the dbn model can be illustrated fig 8 b presents the change of fatigue failure probability results from the change of other basic causations it is assumed that the probability of the critical causations x16 increases to 110 the probability of fatigue failure of spanning pipelines increases from 0 01518 to 0 01523 when the probabilities of critical causations x5 and x16 increase to 110 the probability of fatigue failure increases from 0 01523 to 0 01524 when the probabilities of critical causations x4 x5 and x16 were increased to 110 the probability of fatigue failure increases from 0 01524 to 0 01525 when the probabilities of critical causations x2 x4 x5 and x16 were increased to 110 the probability of fatigue failure increases from 0 01525 to 0 01526 when the probabilities of critical causations x2 x4 x5 x9 x16 increase to 110 the probability of fatigue failure increases from 0 01526 to 0 01527 furthermore when the probabilities of critical events x2 x4 x5 x8 x9 and x16 increase to 110 the probability of fatigue failure increases from 0 01527 to 0 01529 the probabilities decrease in critical causations will lead to a decrease in fatigue failure probability within a reasonable range 4 conclusions in this paper a probabilistic methodology for fatigue failure assessment of spanning subsea pipeline is proposed fatigue failure scenario is constructed by identifying the risk factors associated with fatigue failure and the relationship among them fuzzy set theory and evidence theory are employed to handle the data uncertainties resulting from subjectivity and incompleteness while estimating the probabilities of basic causations dbn is used to capture the uncertainties and time dependence of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline the proposed methodology can perform a real time assessment of fatigue failure of spanning pipeline besides the results can be updated when new observations are available the advantage of the methodology over previous techniques used for a similar purpose can be summarized as follows this methodology can cope with the data uncertainty and be suitable for risk assessment of the cases with limited or missing data compared to the conventional fatigue damage assessment of spanning pipeline this methodology can capture the dynamic characteristics of fatigue failure by considering the time dependence of fatigue causations dynamic fatigue failure probability of spanning subsea pipeline over its service life can be derived considering the effect of fatigue damage accumulation the proposed model is applied to a spanning subsea pipeline by analyzing the fatigue failure of the pipeline it is determined that pipelines corrosion pipelines damage initial crack initial span insufficient burial depth and accumulation of fatigue are self circulation nodes the fatigue failure probability of spanning pipelines increases over the year the analysis results of dynamic failure probability can support the safety management of spanning pipelines through diagnostic analysis a total of 6 critical causations leading to fatigue failure were identified the comparison of the prior and the posterior probability presented that third party activities seabed change high pressure of conveying medium and insufficient burial depth are the most probable factors causing fatigue failure the corresponding measures should be adopted to reduce the probability of fatigue failure of spanning pipelines in addition the robustness of this model is verified by the sensitivity analysis which reflects the applicability of the model to dynamic probability assessment the uniqueness of this paper is an attempt to study the fatigue failure of spanning pipeline from a probabilistic perspective the model could help to identify the most probable causations of fatigue failure and predict the dynamic evolution of spanning pipeline fatigue failure over its service period the methodology can support risk assessment and management of subsea pipelines and other offshore facilities subjected to fatigue failure the limitation is that the present work simplifies the correlation among different basic causations future work is planned to integrate copula function and dbn to better handle the correlation and dependence among basic accident causations besides a data driven model can also be developed to predict fatigue damage of spanning pipeline through the data obtained from experiments credit authorship contribution statement xinhong li methodology writing original draft design drafting paper
