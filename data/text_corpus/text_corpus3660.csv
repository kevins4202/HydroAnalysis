18300,for achieving energy efficient wastewater treatment a novel simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal snpr process which integrated anammox endogenous partial denitrification and denitrifying dephosphatation in a sequencing batch reactor with granular sludge was developed to treat mainstream wastewater after 200 days of operation a simultaneous high level nitrogen and phosphorus removal of 93 9 and 94 2 respectively was achieved with an average influent c n ratio of 2 9 anammox pathway contributed 82 9 of the overall nitrogen removal because of the stable nitrite production from nitrate via endogenous partial denitrification in addition phosphorus was mainly removed via denitrifying dephosphatation utilizing nitrate as the electron acceptor resulting in a significant saving of carbon sources and oxygen demands further adsorption precipitation of phosphorus occurred in this novel snpr process which displaced the energy source to the metabolism of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos for nitrite production and alleviated competition between phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and anammox for electron acceptor using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis the study found that anammox bacteria 8 4 gaos 1 5 and paos 1 1 co existed in this system potentially resulting in simultaneous endogenous partial denitrification anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation the above results demonstrated that the novel snpr process is a promising technique for energy efficient wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords mainstream anammox endogenous partial denitrification nutrient removal granular sludge municipal wastewater 1 introduction due to considerable operational costs of traditional wastewater biological treatment process there is an ongoing paradigm shift in wastewater treatment approaches to achieve energy neutral cao et al 2017 in this context anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox which is an economical and sustainable process converting ammonium and nitrite to nitrogen gas has attracted a significant attention in the past decade lotti et al 2014 significant efforts have been made on the research of nitritation anammox pathways wherein the nitrite for anammox is supplied via nitritation nh4 n no2 n however the excessive growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob regularly occurred in the current mainstream nitritation anammox process led to fluctuation in the nitrite to ammonium ratios and reduced nitrogen removal efficiencies approximately 70 miao et al 2017 the effluent nitrate produced by anammox bacteria or nob is generally above 10 mg n l in actual operation lotti et al 2014 which fails to meet the strict sewage discharge standard although several studies integrated denitrifying dephosphatation with partial nitritation anammox process to alleviate the nitrate accumulation wen et al 2016 xu et al 2019 practical application of mainstream anammox processes still faced the main challenge of stable nitrite production via nitritation pathway with the low strength municipal wastewater ma et al 2017a wang et al 2019a partial denitrification methods are proposed as a promising technology to generate no2 n from nitrate wastewater for anammox reaction du et al 2017 ji et al 2018a kalyuzhnyi et al 2008 le et al 2019 li et al 2018 it was reported that the nitrite producing pathway was relatively steady compared to nitritation especially for low strength municipal wastewater ma et al 2017a moreover several studies demonstrated that the partial denitrification anammox system could alleviate the superfluous no3 n produced by nob or anammox due to further reduction of no3 n to no2 n via partial denitrification ji et al 2018a kalyuzhnyi et al 2008 it is noteworthy that the current studies focus on the partial denitrification anammox process driven by exogenous carbon sources in the anoxic environment that are unfavorable to the activities of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos therefore po4 3 p involved in the influent should be removed generally by chemical methods resulting in the increase of operation costs notably glycogen accumulating organisms gaos proliferation always accompanied with the enrichment of paos in the denitrifying dephosphatation process in which gaos performed partial denitrification for reducing nitrate to nitrite martín et al 2006 rubio rincón et al 2017 that is paos and gaos absorb and transform the carbon sources into polyhydroxyalkanoates phas under anaerobic condition and then oxidize them as electron donor for glycogen gly re synthesis phosphorus uptake only paos and cell reproduction with no3 n or no2 n as electron acceptors in the subsequent anoxic condition martín et al 2006 zhou et al 2008a moreover the recent report showed that endogenous partial denitrification epd driven by gaos could provide steady no2 n for anammox with a high nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio of 87 ji et al 2017 wang et al 2019b demonstrated the potential for achieving nitrogen and phosphorus removal by combining anammox with epd and denitrifying dephosphatation in two stage reactors in which nitrate produced by the anammox reaction was not able to be further removed therefore it is hypothesized in this study that nitrite produced by gaos could achieve a synergy of anammox epd and denitrifying dephosphatation in single reactor which was unexplored to date with proposed conceptual process design fig 1 a mainstream wastewater containing ammonium phosphorus and a low level of organic carbon was fed into the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal snpr reactor to transform biodegradable carbon sources to phas subsequently the supernatant was fed into the nitrifying reactor for generating nitrate from ammonium and then fed back into the snpr reactor during the anoxic stage with the denitrifying dephosphatation epd could occur and provide nitrite for the anammox reaction resulting in high level nitrogen and phosphorus removal in the snpr reactor accordingly this study aims to assess the feasibility of the novel snpr process based on anammox epd and denitrifying dephosphatation for energy efficient wastewater treatment a lab scale snpr process involving two sludge reactors namely an snpr reactor with granular sludge and a nitrification reactor with suspended sludge was operated for 200 days to investigate the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance from synthetic sewage like wastewater the nitrogen and phosphorus removal pathways in the snpr reactor were studied via on site biomass activity assessment the microstructure of the endogenous denitrification granules was investigated by scanning electron microscope sem with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds furthermore the microbial community variations of the snpr reactor were identified using the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing technique 2 material and methods 2 1 process design and operation a lab scale 2 sludge

operational conditions of the system are shown in table 1 synthetic sewage wastewater with respective nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations of 60 mg n l and 180 mg l and ph of 7 6 7 8 was used in this study resulting in a nitrogen loading rate of 0 105 kg n m3 d for the whole system supporting information the snpr sbr was inoculated with endogenous partial denitrification sludge from an enriched epd reactor treating nitrate wastewater and the granular anammox sludge from a nitritation anammox reactor cheng et al 2017 ji et al 2017 the mass ratio of epd sludge to anammox sludge was 1 2 resulting in a volatile suspended solid vss of 4 53 g l in the snpr sbr the cycle time of the snpr sbr was 6 h fig 1b consisting of 120 min anaerobic reaction including 110 min continuous feeding period 30 min settling and 10 min decanting 80 min anoxic reaction including an initial 10 min feeding period 15 min settling 10 min decanting and 95 min idle period the volume

min settling 10 min decanting and 130 min idle period the n sbr volume exchange ratio was 60 with an hrt of 5 h and temperature in the n sbr was not controlled ph was also not controlled but varied between 7 3 and 8 1 over a cycle 2 2 analytical methods the influent and effluent samples of the snpr sbr and n sbr were collected and filtered using 0 45 μm filter paper for analyzing no3 n no2 n nh4

number srp158954 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of n and p removal in 2 sludge snpr system 3 1 1 performance of the nitrifying process n sbr the n sbr was set up to provide no3 n for the snpr sbr the variations of influent and effluent nitrogen species are presented in fig s1 along with the nh4 n removal efficiency during the first 63 days of operation the influent nh4 n slightly declined from an average of 35 4 mg n l to 32 6 mg n l resulting in a decrease in no3 n concentrations to an average of 31 2 mg n l from 33 1 mg n l in the n sbr effluent nh4 n was steadily removed with an efficiency of 99 during the 200 days of operation fig s1 thus nitrate was produced at a stable rate in the n sbr with no special process control and was further utilized in the snpr sbr as comprehensively discussed in section 3 1 2 3 1 2 performance of the simultaneous epd anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation in the snpr sbr with an average influent cod to nh4 n ratio of 2 9 the snpr sbr ran for 200 days and was divided into 3 phases according to the nh4 n removal performance of the anoxic stage and the influent po4 3 p concentration table 1 in phase ⅰ day 1 51 the average concentration of influent po4 3 p was 6 3 mg p l with a negligible nh4 n removal leading to a high nh4 n 14 9 mg n l in the effluent meanwhile a high effluent no2 n 12 9 mg n l was observed between day 1 30 no2 n and nh4 n co existed in the snpr sbr during the anoxic stage creating the favorable conditions for anammox bacteria growth however anammox reaction has not occurred in phase ⅰ fig 2 a which was probably due to the shock effects of the organic matter addition and the starvation of anammox bacteria during the anaerobic period du et al 2017 ma et al 2017b this indicated that the anammox bacteria were susceptible to the change of operational conditions compared with the seeding sludge and might require a longer time for acclimation notably no2 n concentration of the effluent declined approximately to 0 mg n l from 12 9 mg n l between day 30 51 in phase ⅰ fig 2a meanwhile the po4 3 p removal efficiency increased to 87 6 from 46 7 while po4 3 p concentration at the end anaerobic phase gradually rose to about 22 8 mg p l in phase ⅰ fig 2b this indicated that the denitrifying dephosphatation occurred and could compete for electron acceptor no2 n with anammox to avoid the excess growth of denitrifying paos and accelerate the acclimation of anammox po4 3 p concentration of the influent was reduced to 1 9 mg p l in phase ⅱ day 52 89 as shown in fig 2b po4 3 p concentration was gradually declined at the end of the anaerobic phase and then remained at about 9 1 mg p l in phase ⅱ reducing the considerable no2 n consumption via denitrifying dephosphatation consequently no2 n concentration of the effluent recovered to 7 5 mg n l during the first 16 days of phase ⅱ fig 2a potentially contributing to the anammox reaction it was observed that nh4 n concentration in the effluent progressively declined after day 59 following by the decrease of the effluent no2 n concentration on day 80 the effluent nh4 n and total inorganic nitrogen tin concentrations were reduced to 2 1 mg n l and 7 8 mg n l respectively this suggested that suppressing the growth of denitrifying paos facilitated anammox bacteria acclimatizing in the alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions of this snpr system in phase ⅲ day 90 200 the influent po4 3 p concentration was restored to around 6 3 mg p l to further evaluate the resilience of this snpr system consequently at the end anaerobic phase po4 3 p concentration increased to 16 2 mg p l and then remained at around 15 5 mg p l between day 98 165 fig 2b the effluent po4 3 p concentration remained at around 2 4 mg p l with low po4 3 p removal performance 57 9 between day 90 142 fig 2b however effluent po4 3 p concentration declined with a gradual increase of po4 3 p removal efficiency between day 143 151 fig 2b likely owing to the proliferation of paos during the long term operation then the effluent po4 3 p concentration remained at an average of 0 3 mg p l and the po4 3 p removal efficiency reached up to 94 2 after day 151 furthermore the end anaerobic phase po4 3 p concentration slightly decreased to 12 3 mg p l from 15 5 mg p l on day 168 200 fig 2b which might be because of the competitive disadvantage of paos to gaos in the carbon sources storage during the anaerobic stage with the long term operation this reduced the amount of p uptake during the anoxic stage leaving more nitrate for epd to provide nitrite for anammox reaction on the other hand the effluent nh4 n concentration remained at around 2 1 mg n l throughout phase ⅲ day 90 200 fig 2a indicating that the anammox activity after acclimation could be steady with the increase from 1 9 mg p l to 6 3 mg p l of influent po4 3 p concentration thus total inorganic nitrogen tin removal efficiency was at 93 9 with an average effluent tin concentration of 3 6 mg n l suggesting that the co existence of epd anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation could achieve advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in this snpr system which had a promising prospect as an energy efficient sewage treatment 3 1 3 anammox enhancing nitrogen removal performance of the snpr process in the snpr sbr biomass activities of denitrification anammox and phosphorus uptake were characterized by the snh4 snox and spo4 during the anoxic stage respectively fig 3 a the phosphorus uptake activity clearly improved with the spo4 increasing from 2 17 mg p gvss 1 h 1 to 5 21 mg p gvss 1 h 1 in phase ⅰ day 1 51 which might be responsible for the rise of po4 3 p concentration at the end of the anaerobic stage fig 2b this was due to the longer anoxic reaction time 80 min of the snpr sbr which might contribute to the activity of paos compared to the parent epd sbr 40 min ji et al 2017 with the increase in the phosphorus uptake activity the snox improved to 3 49 mg n gvss 1 h 1 from 1 68 mg n gvss 1 h 1 this was lower than the kinetics 5 0 15 0 mg n gvss 1 h 1 of the work from ribera guardia et al 2016 which might be due to the lower c n ratio 2 9 than that 6 7 8 0 of the previous work notably the anammox activity approached to zero fig 3a indicating that denitrification was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway with a low tin removal efficiency of 58 1 in phase ⅰ fig 3b as the influent po4 3 p concentration decreased the phosphorus uptake activity decreased to 3 1 mg p gvss 1 h 1 from 5 2 mg p gvss 1 h 1 in phase ⅱ day 52 89 fig 3a meanwhile the anammox activity gradually improved with the snh4 increasing to 3 5 mgn gvss 1 h 1 fig 3a confirming that alleviation of paos activity contributed to the recovery of the anammox activity in the anoxic stage consequently the tin removal efficiency enhanced to about 93 9 on day 89 while the anammox and denitrifying pathway contributed 81 7 and 18 3 respectively fig 3b this indicated that the increment of anammox enhanced nitrogen removal of snpr although the influent po4 3 p concentration restored to 6 3 mg p l from 1 9 mg p l in phase ⅲ day 90 200 the phosphorus uptake activity did not change significantly when the spo4 remained at around 3 1 mg p gvss 1 h 1 fig 3a interestingly phosphorus removal efficiency improved to 94 2 without a recovery of phosphorus uptake rate on day 151 200 fig 2b the reason might be that the decline of released phosphorus amount during the anaerobic stage and the formation of p precipitate reduced the amount of p uptake during the anoxic stage the phosphorus uptake activity was also limited by the electron acceptor due to the substrate competition no2 n from anammox generally the autotrophic anammox bacteria have a lower cellular synthesis yield and growth rate compared with the heterotrophic microorganism cao et al 2017 miao et al 2017 it is established that the anammox and heterotrophic denitrifying microorganism could co exist for the population balance in a partial denitrification anammox process du et al 2017 this conclusion might be also applicable to this novel snpr system leading to a steady activity of anammox while the snh4 remained at around 3 4 mg n gvss 1 h 1 therefore the anammox pathway was still the dominant process for tin removal 82 9 fig 3b ensuring the achievement of the stable and improved nitrogen removal 93 9 between day 90 200 this further indicated that the enhancement of anammox activity was critical for the synergy of epd anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation in addition although n2o can form in the dephosphatation denitrification based systems via reducing no2 n gao et al 2017 the n2o production in this system potentially had been low and we did not measure it this also benefited from the large contribution 82 9 of anammox to tin removal since the metabolic pathways of anammox bacteria directly oxidized nh4 n to n2 with no2 n as electron acceptor without n2o production okabe et al 2011 thus anammox pathway significantly enhanced the nitrogen removal performance of the snpr process significantly saving the demand for both carbon source and oxygen and reducing the n2o production 3 2 high level nutrient removal mechanism of this novel snpr system 3 2 1 variation of nutrients in typical operational cycles of the snpr sbr in different phases the analyses of typical operation cycle during phase ⅱ day 89 and phase ⅲ day 189 were used to explore the mechanism of nutrients transformation and removal in this novel snpr system fig 4 during the anaerobic stage 120 min the cod concentrations slightly varied with the domestic like wastewater when continuously fed into the reactor on day 89 and day 189 fig 4a and b while the phas and gly increased and decreased respectively fig 4c and d this indicated that the carbon sources in the influent were absorbed and stored as endogenous carbon by paos or gaos additionally the po4 3 p concentrations raised to 9 3 mg p l and 14 1 mg p l on day 89 and day 189 respectively although the influent po4 3 p concentrations elevated to 6 3 mg p l in phase ⅲ the po4 3 p release 10 8 mg p l at the anaerobic stage was significantly lower than the values 22 40 mg p l reported by previous studies on phosphorus removal from the domestic wastewaters with enriched paos population wang et al 2013 wang et al 2015b the reason was that the paos did not dominate in this snpr system while low po4 3 p release indicates that the small amount of po4 3 p had to be taken up in the anoxic stage leaving more electronic acceptor no2 n for anammox growth during the first 50 min of anoxic stage no2 n gradually increased to the maximum value 10 4 mg n l and 5 9 mg n l respectively on day 89 and day 189 when no3 n declined to zero fig 4a and b creating conditions for anammox reaction in the snpr system meanwhile the po4 3 p and nh4 n showed a clear decrease with the replenishment of gly and the degradation of phas fig 4c and d suggesting that the epd denitrifying dephosphatation and anammox reaction occurred simultaneously due to the consumption of anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation the maximum no2 n accumulation was lower in this snpr system than the enriched endogenous partial denitrification system that produced 16 4 mg n l no2 n in the anoxic stage ji et al 2017 in this period po4 3 p and no3 n were completely consumed leading to the anammox process being the dominant pathway of the nitrogen removal in the following 30 min notably when nh4 n remained around 2 1 mg n l the no2 n concentration was 0 5 mg n l at the end of the anoxic stage on day 189 while it was about 2 9 mg n l on day 89 fig 4a and b the enhanced nox n removal at the anoxic stage of phase ⅲ was due to the increase of po4 3 p uptake 4 8 mg p l interestingly although no3 n was expected to be produced with the anammox reaction the no3 n concentration was almost not detected at the end of the anoxic stage in phase ⅲ fig 4b the reason for this anomaly was that the no3 n from anammox reaction could be further used by denitrifying gaos or paos for producing no2 n or n2 thus this snpr system had a unique advantage of obtaining complete nitrogen removal with simultaneous p removal compared with the nitritation anammox system where the nitrate produced by nob and anammox processes usually remain in the effluent lotti et al 2014 3 2 2 stoichiometry based evaluations of cooperation and competition of denitrifying gaos denitrifying paos and anammox in order to further understand the cooperation and competition among denitrifying gaos denitrifying paos and anammox in the snpr system the nutrient and intracellular carbon transformation stoichiometry of the typical cycle were calculated on day 189 table 2 the δp δcod ratio 0 12 mol p mol c at the anaerobic stage of this system was far lower than the paos model value 0 5 mol p mol c reported by smolders et al 1994b however the δgly δcod ratio 1 16 mol c mol c and δphas δcod ratio 1 81 mol c mol c were close to that of the gaos 1 12 mol c mol c and 1 85 mol c mol c reported by zeng et al 2003 this indicated that the metabolism of gaos was dominant for storing exogenous carbon sources as phas driving the reduction of nitrate to nitrite and denitrifying dephosphatation in the following stage at the anoxic stage δgly δphas ratio 0 64 mol c mol c was higher than 0 42 mol c mol c of the paos model reported by smolders et al 1994a and lower than 0 75 mol c mol c of the gaos model reported by zeng et al 2003 suggesting that paos and gaos were both involved in the endogenous denitrifying process additionally δno3 n δphas ratio 0 25 mol n mol c and δno3 n δgly ratio 0 39 mol n mol c were consistent with the denitrifying gaos value 0 24 mol n mol c and 0 33 mol n mol c respectively reported by wang et al 2015b previous studies demonstrated that gaos were responsible for the high no2 n accumulation via reducing no3 n ji et al 2017 zeng et al 2003 facilitating the occurrence of anammox and the removal of nh4 n during the anoxic stage 1 c2h4o2 0 16nh4 0 2po4 3 0 96no3 0 16c5h7no2 1 2co2 0 2hpo3 1 4oh 0 48n2 0 96h2o on the other hand δp δphas ratio 0 09 mol p mol c was lower than 0 16 0 24 mol p mol c of the denitrifying paos model reported by guisasola et al 2009 indicating that the endogenous denitrification was driven by both denitrifying gaos and paos based on the stoichiometry of the denitrifying phosphorus removal system shown in eq 1 henze et al 2001 the reduction of 1 00 mg of no3 n to n2 and no2 n to n2 could theoretically remove 1 410 mg and 0 846 mg of po4 3 p respectively as shown in fig 4b no3 n and nh4 n decreased by 18 5 mg n l and 10 9 mg n l respectively in a typical cycle of phase ⅲ when postulating that denitrifying paos could reduce no3 n to no2 n and further to n2 the maximum decrease in po4 3 p was 18 0 mg p l 1 410 mg p mg n 0 846 mg p mg n 18 5 mg n l 0 26 10 9 mg n l 0 846 mg p mg n 18 5 mg n l 0 26 10 9 mg n l 1 32 10 9 mg n l at the anoxic stage evidently the decreased po4 3 p 13 8 mg p l was lower than the maximum value demonstrating that the cooperation of anammox and denitrifying phosphorus removal processes were feasible with the competition for no2 n between annamox bacteria and paos in this novel snpr system 3 2 3 analysis of scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectrometry eds on the endogenous denitrification granules the gaos metabolism played a main role in nitrite production for anammox reaction resulting in the decline of nitrate for denitrifying dephosphatation and a decrease of the phosphorus uptake during the anoxic stage although the phosphorus uptake activity kept at around 3 1 mg p gvss 1 h 1 in phase ⅲ fig 3a the effluent po4 3 p concentrations reduced to 0 3 mg p l between day 151 200 from 2 3 mg p l between day 90 150 while the po4 3 p removal efficiency enhanced by 34 0 fig 2b this indicated that other pathway contributed to po4 3 p removal and to achieve high phosphorus removal 94 2 in the snpr system fig 2b as evident in fig 5 a a large number of white crystalline precipitate cores were present within the endogenous denitrification granules on day 189 a similar phenomenon was found in the previous study mañas et al 2011 demonstrating that the white crystalline precipitate cores were mainly caused by hydroxyapatites hence the formation of phosphate precipitate allowed achieving the improved phosphorus removal in this snpr system notably fig 5b and d showed that phosphorus and calcium coexisted in the inorganic precipitates of endogenous denitrification granules while only a significant accumulation of phosphorus existed in the microorganism cells fig 5b and c this confirmed that p ca precipitated during the operation of the snpr system enhancing the phosphorus removal performance however previous studies demonstrated that about 45 of tp was removed by the p ca precipitation in the ebpr granular sludge mañas et al 2011 it was reported that the granules created suitable conditions for accelerating p metal precipitation such as 1 anaerobic condition naturally formed at the core of granular sludge wherein p and metal accumulation and a higher local ph typically occur due to the limitation of mass transfer resulted from the granules dense structure and 2 the sludge age of granules was relatively longer than the conventional activated sludge li et al 2015 wan et al 2015 therefore free ortho p commonly formed a precipitate with ca2 in granular sludge over floc sludge li et al 2015 which might also be the case in the snpr reactor and result in the decline of po4 3 p concentration at the end of anaerobic stage on day 168 200 on the other hand a large amount of phosphorus existed in eps fig 5b and e denotating that eps also contributed to the phosphorus removal in this system previous studies reported that due to the high adsorption capability eps contains many metal cations k mg2 and ca2 resulting in reservation of about 5 46 of phosphorus in sludge via the complexation of p metal wang et al 2015a zhang et al 2013a the above results concluded that the good p removal performance was obtained with a limited paos activity in phase ⅲ in addition such adsorption precipitation of p was beneficial to decrease the energy source for poly p synthetization via paos metabolism and displace the energy source to gaos metabolism li et al 2015 the adsorption precipitation of p not only alleviated paos competing electron acceptor with anammox but also guaranteed gaos producing no2 n for anammox growth 3 3 long term abundance dynamics of the functional bacterial species involved in the snpr sbr the microbial communities in the snpr sbr during phase ⅱ day 89 and phase ⅲ day 195 were characterized by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis fig 6 in the phase ⅱ sample candidatus competibacter was 1 6 of the relative abundance fig 6 and was from a deep branching group of gammaproteobacteria identified as gaos rubio rincón et al 2017 dechloromonas which had the same phenotype of defluviicoccus known as another group of gaos comprised 0 4 of the relative abundance on day 89 nielsen et al 2019 gaos have the denitrifying capability under the anoxic conditions and produce high nitrite accumulation ji et al 2017 rubio rincón et al 2017 zeng et al 2003 notably candidatus competibacter and dechloromonas played a key role in the reduction of nitrate to nitrite driven by internal phas rubio rincón et al 2017 their high abundance and the observation of significant nitrite accumulation with the reduction of nitrate on day 89 fig 4a suggested that candidatus competibacter and dechloromonas might be responsible for the endogenous partial denitrification the genus candidatus accumulibacter from betaproteobacteria was detected as paos with an abundance of 0 9 in the phase ⅱ sample fig 6 some strains of candidatus accumulibacter have the capability to remove phosphorus under anoxic conditions using no3 n or no2 n instead of o2 as electron acceptors wang et al 2019b moreover paos can behave as gaos under p limiting conditions zhou et al 2008b the relatively lower abundance of candidatus accumulibacter illustrated that paos were inhibited potentially reducing the competition for nitrite and thereby accelerating the growth of anammox in phase ⅱ it was found that the abundances of candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia anammox bacteria du et al 2017 were 0 6 and 1 1 respectively in phase ⅱ sample fig 6 compared with the abundance of paos the higher abundance of anammox bacteria 1 7 likely contributed to the recovery and stabilization of the anammox activity in phase ⅱ fig 3a in addition the anaerolineaceae uncultured within to chloroflexi was the prominent genus 50 2 55 4 in both samples fig 6 it was consistent with previous studies mielczarek et al 2012 which found that the widely distributed anaerolineaceae population was responsible for sludge granules after the influent po4 3 p concentration restored to 6 3 mg p l in phase ⅲ the candidatus accumulibacter paos abundance increased slightly to 1 1 on day 195 while the two gaos genera candidatus competibacter and dechloromonas decreased to 1 2 and 0 3 respectively fig 6 this was in agreement with the moderate gly consumption reduction in the anaerobic stage fig 4c and d as more poly p was degraded as an energy source for paos metabolism compared with phase ⅱ in this phase however the relatively lower abundance of paos was mainly due to the electron acceptor limitation resulting from the competition of gaos and anammox it indicates that the propagation of gaos over paos did not inevitably result in ebpr deterioration which was in line with the recent work from nielsen et al 2019 in this case the good performance of p removal was also benefited by the adsorption precipitation of p accompanied with biological phosphorus removal process in this snpr system fig 5 several studies also showed that the po4 3 p removal was stable and efficient despite the suppression of paos metabolism because of the significant contribution of p adsorption precipitation wang et al 2015a on the other hand anammox bacteria gained adequate no2 n for growth in the system due to the weak competition of paos for electron acceptors it was observed that the abundances of two anammox genera candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia increased to 6 5 and 1 9 respectively fig 6 suggesting that the anammox co existed with gaos and paos in this snpr system thus functional groups such as gaos anammox and paos could be synergistically responsible for the stable performance of this snpr system for energy efficient wastewater treatment 3 4 feasibility and reliability of 2 sludge snpr system for treating low c n wastewaters table 3 compares the performance of nutrient removal in the 2 sludge snpr system with other systems reported in the literature as shown in table 3 the conventional denitrification process without adding external carbon sources often achieves low nitrogen removal efficiencies 73 9 for low c n sewage even if through the nitrite pathway ma et al 2009 meanwhile before denitrification all the influent nh4 n needed to be oxidized to nox n in order to produce more energy consumption for aeration in this study only 60 of influent nh4 n was oxidized to no3 n and about 82 9 of tin removal was achieved through anammox pathway significantly saving the demand for both carbon source and oxygen typical nitritation anammox systems generally fail to achieve high level nitrogen removal 80 81 because of the excess nitrate produced by nob and anammox jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2013b however the nitrogen removal performance of this novel snpr process was about 93 9 table 3 this was due to the fact that the generated nitrate was further reduced to nitrite for anammox reaction through endogenous partial denitrification significantly improving the nitrogen removal performance in this study on the other hand compared with traditional 2 sludge and 3 stage bnr process where high effluent nh4 n is usually detected zhou et al 2008a this technology has a unique advantage of achieving mainstream anammox with simultaneous denitrifying dephosphatation for the configuration of 2 sludge and 3 stage bnr system without being nitrified a considerable proportion of influent nh4 n with the first settled sludge stream was transferred directly to the anoxic reactor and remained in the effluent this resulted in relatively poor performance 74 6 88 2 of nitrogen removal while the phosphorus removal efficiency was up to 94 0 99 3 kuba et al 1996 zhao et al 2016 however the 2 sludge snpr system could successfully gain the high level nitrogen and phosphorus removal 93 9 and 94 2 respectively table 3 owing to the contribution of partial denitrification and anammox during the anoxic stage effluent nh4 n kept at a lower level of 2 1 mg n l in this study additionally compared with the 1 sludge snpr systems wang et al 2015b xu et al 2019 this novel 2 sludge snpr system achieved the higher nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies with a lower hrt table 3 kept aeration from consuming the endogenous carbon sources and enhanced the nitrogen removal contribution of anammox pathway considering c n ratio between 3 and 12 for real municipal wastewater cao et al 2017 ma et al 2009 this snpr process can be combined with the cod capture technology through which the organics sludge can be harvested for producing biomethane on the other hand a low c n 2 6 3 1 effluent of the high rate activated sludge system which was reported to capture carbon could be gained with a suitable solids retention time rahman et al 2016 in conclusion the organics contained in the effluent of the cod capture system were adequate to meet the demands of the snpr system used in this study the performance of this system needed to be further investigated for treating actual sewage overall at the steady period phase iii this system exhibited stable and high level of nitrogen and phosphorus removal 93 9 and 94 2 respectively clearly indicating that this novel snpr process has potential in mainstream wastewater treatment plants with minimum energy consumption and maximum energy recovery 4 conclusion the novel snpr system based on epd anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation was developed and successfully operated to treat sewage like wastewater for over 200 days the following main conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 with low c n ratio 2 9 a simultaneous high level nitrogen and phosphorus removal 93 9 and 94 2 respectively was achieved with the average effluent tin nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations of 3 6 mg n l 2 1 mg n l and 0 3 mg p l respectively this indicated that the novel snpr process has promising prospect to obtain advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in the mainstream of wastewater treatment plants 2 at the steady period the anammox pathway in the novel snpr system occupied dominant position for total nitrogen removal with a significant percentage of 82 9 in addition p was mainly removed with no3 n as the electron acceptor via denitrifying dephosphatation thus this technology offers considerable savings in both carbon sources and oxygen demands 3 adsorption precipitation of phosphorus were involved in the snpr granular sludge which not only displaced the energy source to the metabolism of gaos for nitrite production but also alleviated paos competition for electron acceptor with anammox 4 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis revealed that anammox 8 4 gaos 1 5 and paos 1 1 co existed in this novel

18300,for achieving energy efficient wastewater treatment a novel simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal snpr process which integrated anammox endogenous partial denitrification and denitrifying dephosphatation in a sequencing batch reactor with granular sludge was developed to treat mainstream wastewater after 200 days of operation a simultaneous high level nitrogen and phosphorus removal of 93 9 and 94 2 respectively was achieved with an average influent c n ratio of 2 9 anammox pathway contributed 82 9 of the overall nitrogen removal because of the stable nitrite production from nitrate via endogenous partial denitrification in addition phosphorus was mainly removed via denitrifying dephosphatation utilizing nitrate as the electron acceptor resulting in a significant saving of carbon sources and oxygen demands further adsorption precipitation of phosphorus occurred in this novel snpr process which displaced the energy source to the metabolism of glycogen accumulating organisms gaos for nitrite production and alleviated competition between phosphorus accumulating organisms paos and anammox for electron acceptor using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis the study found that anammox bacteria 8 4 gaos 1 5 and paos 1 1 co existed in this system potentially resulting in simultaneous endogenous partial denitrification anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation the above results demonstrated that the novel snpr process is a promising technique for energy efficient wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords mainstream anammox endogenous partial denitrification nutrient removal granular sludge municipal wastewater 1 introduction due to considerable operational costs of traditional wastewater biological treatment process there is an ongoing paradigm shift in wastewater treatment approaches to achieve energy neutral cao et al 2017 in this context anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox which is an economical and sustainable process converting ammonium and nitrite to nitrogen gas has attracted a significant attention in the past decade lotti et al 2014 significant efforts have been made on the research of nitritation anammox pathways wherein the nitrite for anammox is supplied via nitritation nh4 n no2 n however the excessive growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob regularly occurred in the current mainstream nitritation anammox process led to fluctuation in the nitrite to ammonium ratios and reduced nitrogen removal efficiencies approximately 70 miao et al 2017 the effluent nitrate produced by anammox bacteria or nob is generally above 10 mg n l in actual operation lotti et al 2014 which fails to meet the strict sewage discharge standard although several studies integrated denitrifying dephosphatation with partial nitritation anammox process to alleviate the nitrate accumulation wen et al 2016 xu et al 2019 practical application of mainstream anammox processes still faced the main challenge of stable nitrite production via nitritation pathway with the low strength municipal wastewater ma et al 2017a wang et al 2019a partial denitrification methods are proposed as a promising technology to generate no2 n from nitrate wastewater for anammox reaction du et al 2017 ji et al 2018a kalyuzhnyi et al 2008 le et al 2019 li et al 2018 it was reported that the nitrite producing pathway was relatively steady compared to nitritation especially for low strength municipal wastewater ma et al 2017a moreover several studies demonstrated that the partial denitrification anammox system could alleviate the superfluous no3 n produced by nob or anammox due to further reduction of no3 n to no2 n via partial denitrification ji et al 2018a kalyuzhnyi et al 2008 it is noteworthy that the current studies focus on the partial denitrification anammox process driven by exogenous carbon sources in the anoxic environment that are unfavorable to the activities of phosphorus accumulating organisms paos therefore po4 3 p involved in the influent should be removed generally by chemical methods resulting in the increase of operation costs notably glycogen accumulating organisms gaos proliferation always accompanied with the enrichment of paos in the denitrifying dephosphatation process in which gaos performed partial denitrification for reducing nitrate to nitrite martín et al 2006 rubio rincón et al 2017 that is paos and gaos absorb and transform the carbon sources into polyhydroxyalkanoates phas under anaerobic condition and then oxidize them as electron donor for glycogen gly re synthesis phosphorus uptake only paos and cell reproduction with no3 n or no2 n as electron acceptors in the subsequent anoxic condition martín et al 2006 zhou et al 2008a moreover the recent report showed that endogenous partial denitrification epd driven by gaos could provide steady no2 n for anammox with a high nitrate to nitrite transformation ratio of 87 ji et al 2017 wang et al 2019b demonstrated the potential for achieving nitrogen and phosphorus removal by combining anammox with epd and denitrifying dephosphatation in two stage reactors in which nitrate produced by the anammox reaction was not able to be further removed therefore it is hypothesized in this study that nitrite produced by gaos could achieve a synergy of anammox epd and denitrifying dephosphatation in single reactor which was unexplored to date with proposed conceptual process design fig 1 a mainstream wastewater containing ammonium phosphorus and a low level of organic carbon was fed into the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal snpr reactor to transform biodegradable carbon sources to phas subsequently the supernatant was fed into the nitrifying reactor for generating nitrate from ammonium and then fed back into the snpr reactor during the anoxic stage with the denitrifying dephosphatation epd could occur and provide nitrite for the anammox reaction resulting in high level nitrogen and phosphorus removal in the snpr reactor accordingly this study aims to assess the feasibility of the novel snpr process based on anammox epd and denitrifying dephosphatation for energy efficient wastewater treatment a lab scale snpr process involving two sludge reactors namely an snpr reactor with granular sludge and a nitrification reactor with suspended sludge was operated for 200 days to investigate the simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance from synthetic sewage like wastewater the nitrogen and phosphorus removal pathways in the snpr reactor were studied via on site biomass activity assessment the microstructure of the endogenous denitrification granules was investigated by scanning electron microscope sem with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds furthermore the microbial community variations of the snpr reactor were identified using the 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing technique 2 material and methods 2 1 process design and operation a lab scale 2 sludge

operational conditions of the system are shown in table 1 synthetic sewage wastewater with respective nh4 n and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations of 60 mg n l and 180 mg l and ph of 7 6 7 8 was used in this study resulting in a nitrogen loading rate of 0 105 kg n m3 d for the whole system supporting information the snpr sbr was inoculated with endogenous partial denitrification sludge from an enriched epd reactor treating nitrate wastewater and the granular anammox sludge from a nitritation anammox reactor cheng et al 2017 ji et al 2017 the mass ratio of epd sludge to anammox sludge was 1 2 resulting in a volatile suspended solid vss of 4 53 g l in the snpr sbr the cycle time of the snpr sbr was 6 h fig 1b consisting of 120 min anaerobic reaction including 110 min continuous feeding period 30 min settling and 10 min decanting 80 min anoxic reaction including an initial 10 min feeding period 15 min settling 10 min decanting and 95 min idle period the volume ratio of the snpr sbr discharging into n sbr was 60 and the snpr sbr volume discharge ratio was 50 resulting in a hydraulic retention time hrt of 6 7 h ph was not controlled but varied between 8 0 and 8 4 over a cycle temperature in the snpr sbr was controlled at 27 2 c using a heater the n sbr was inoculated with the suspended sludge from gaobeidian beijing china wastewater treatment plant wwtp

between 7 3 and 8 1 over a cycle 2 2 analytical methods the influent and effluent samples of the snpr sbr and n sbr were collected and filtered using 0 45 μm filter paper for analyzing no3 n no2 n nh4

number srp158954 3 results and discussion 3 1 long term performance of n and p removal in 2 sludge snpr system 3 1 1 performance of the nitrifying process n sbr the n sbr was set up to provide no3 n for the snpr sbr the variations of influent and effluent nitrogen species are presented in fig s1 along with the nh4 n removal efficiency during the first 63 days of operation the influent nh4 n slightly declined from an average of 35 4 mg n l to 32 6 mg n l resulting in a decrease in no3 n concentrations to an average of 31 2 mg n l from 33 1 mg n l in the n sbr effluent nh4 n was steadily removed with an efficiency of 99 during the 200 days of operation fig s1 thus nitrate was produced at a stable rate in the n sbr with no special process control and was further utilized in the snpr sbr as comprehensively discussed in section 3 1 2 3 1 2 performance of the simultaneous epd anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation in the snpr sbr with an average influent cod to nh4 n ratio of 2 9 the snpr sbr ran for 200 days and was divided into 3 phases according to the nh4 n removal performance of the anoxic stage and the influent po4 3 p concentration table 1 in phase ⅰ day 1 51 the average concentration of influent po4 3 p was 6 3 mg p l with a negligible nh4 n removal leading to a high nh4 n 14 9 mg n l in the effluent meanwhile a high effluent no2 n 12 9 mg n l was observed between day 1 30 no2 n and nh4 n co existed in the snpr sbr during the anoxic stage creating the favorable conditions for anammox bacteria growth however anammox reaction has not occurred in phase ⅰ fig 2 a which was probably due to the shock effects of the organic matter addition and the starvation of anammox bacteria during the anaerobic period du et al 2017 ma et al 2017b this indicated that the anammox bacteria were susceptible to the change of operational conditions compared with the seeding sludge and might require a longer time for acclimation notably no2 n concentration of the effluent declined approximately to 0 mg n l from 12 9 mg n l between day 30 51 in phase ⅰ fig 2a meanwhile the po4 3 p removal efficiency increased to 87 6 from 46 7 while po4 3 p concentration at the end anaerobic phase gradually rose to about 22 8 mg p l in phase ⅰ fig 2b this indicated that the denitrifying dephosphatation occurred and could compete for electron acceptor no2 n with anammox to avoid the excess growth of denitrifying paos and accelerate the acclimation of anammox po4 3 p concentration of the influent was reduced to 1 9 mg p l in phase ⅱ day 52 89 as shown in fig 2b po4 3 p concentration was gradually declined at the end of the anaerobic phase and then remained at about 9 1 mg p l in phase ⅱ reducing the considerable no2 n consumption via denitrifying dephosphatation consequently no2 n concentration of the effluent recovered to 7 5 mg n l during the first 16 days of phase ⅱ fig 2a potentially contributing to the anammox reaction it was observed that nh4 n concentration in the effluent progressively declined after day 59 following by the decrease of the effluent no2 n concentration on day 80 the effluent nh4 n and total inorganic nitrogen tin concentrations were reduced to 2 1 mg n l and 7 8 mg n l respectively this suggested that suppressing the growth of denitrifying paos facilitated anammox bacteria acclimatizing in the alternating anaerobic anoxic conditions of this snpr system in phase ⅲ day 90 200 the influent po4 3 p concentration was restored to around 6 3 mg p l to further evaluate the resilience of this snpr system consequently at the end anaerobic phase po4 3 p concentration increased to 16 2 mg p l and then remained at around 15 5 mg p l between day 98 165 fig 2b the effluent po4 3 p concentration remained at around 2 4 mg p l with low po4 3 p removal performance 57 9 between day 90 142 fig 2b however effluent po4 3 p concentration declined with a gradual increase of po4 3 p removal efficiency between day 143 151 fig 2b likely owing to the proliferation of paos during the long term operation then the effluent po4 3 p concentration remained at an average of 0 3 mg p l and the po4 3 p removal efficiency reached up to 94 2 after day 151 furthermore the end anaerobic phase po4 3 p concentration slightly decreased to 12 3 mg p l from 15 5 mg p l on day 168 200 fig 2b which might be because of the competitive disadvantage of paos to gaos in the carbon sources storage during the anaerobic stage with the long term operation this reduced the amount of p uptake during the anoxic stage leaving more nitrate for epd to provide nitrite for anammox reaction on the other hand the effluent nh4 n concentration remained at around 2 1 mg n l throughout phase ⅲ day 90 200 fig 2a indicating that the anammox activity after acclimation could be steady with the increase from 1 9 mg p l to 6 3 mg p l of influent po4 3 p concentration thus total inorganic nitrogen tin removal efficiency was at 93 9 with an average effluent tin concentration of 3 6 mg n l suggesting that the co existence of epd anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation could achieve advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in this snpr system which had a promising prospect as an energy efficient sewage treatment 3 1 3 anammox enhancing nitrogen removal performance of the snpr process in the snpr sbr biomass activities of denitrification anammox and phosphorus uptake were characterized by the snh4 snox and spo4 during the anoxic stage respectively fig 3 a the phosphorus uptake activity clearly improved with the spo4 increasing from 2 17 mg p gvss 1 h 1 to 5 21 mg p gvss 1 h 1 in phase ⅰ day 1 51 which might be responsible for the rise of po4 3 p concentration at the end of the anaerobic stage fig 2b this was due to the longer anoxic reaction time 80 min of the snpr sbr which might contribute to the activity of paos compared to the parent epd sbr 40 min ji et al 2017 with the increase in the phosphorus uptake activity the snox improved to 3 49 mg n gvss 1 h 1 from 1 68 mg n gvss 1 h 1 this was lower than the kinetics 5 0 15 0 mg n gvss 1 h 1 of the work from ribera guardia et al 2016 which might be due to the lower c n ratio 2 9 than that 6 7 8 0 of the previous work notably the anammox activity approached to zero fig 3a indicating that denitrification was the dominant nitrogen removal pathway with a low tin removal efficiency of 58 1 in phase ⅰ fig 3b as the influent po4 3 p concentration decreased the phosphorus uptake activity decreased to 3 1 mg p gvss 1 h 1 from 5 2 mg p gvss 1 h 1 in phase ⅱ day 52 89 fig 3a meanwhile the anammox activity gradually improved with the snh4 increasing to 3 5 mgn gvss 1 h 1 fig 3a confirming that alleviation of paos activity contributed to the recovery of the anammox activity in the anoxic stage consequently the tin removal efficiency enhanced to about 93 9 on day 89 while the anammox and denitrifying pathway contributed 81 7 and 18 3 respectively fig 3b this indicated that the increment of anammox enhanced nitrogen removal of snpr although the influent po4 3 p concentration restored to 6 3 mg p l from 1 9 mg p l in phase ⅲ day 90 200 the phosphorus uptake activity did not change significantly when the spo4 remained at around 3 1 mg p gvss 1 h 1 fig 3a interestingly phosphorus removal efficiency improved to 94 2 without a recovery of phosphorus uptake rate on day 151 200 fig 2b the reason might be that the decline of released phosphorus amount during the anaerobic stage and the formation of p precipitate reduced the amount of p uptake during the anoxic stage the phosphorus uptake activity was also limited by the electron acceptor due to the substrate competition no2 n from anammox generally the autotrophic anammox bacteria have a lower cellular synthesis yield and growth rate compared with the heterotrophic microorganism cao et al 2017 miao et al 2017 it is established that the anammox and heterotrophic denitrifying microorganism could co exist for the population balance in a partial denitrification anammox process du et al 2017 this conclusion might be also applicable to this novel snpr system leading to a steady activity of anammox while the snh4 remained at around 3 4 mg n gvss 1 h 1 therefore the anammox pathway was still the dominant process for tin removal 82 9 fig 3b ensuring the achievement of the stable and improved nitrogen removal 93 9 between day 90 200 this further indicated that the enhancement of anammox activity was critical for the synergy of epd anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation in addition although n2o can form in the dephosphatation denitrification based systems via reducing no2 n gao et al 2017 the n2o production in this system potentially had been low and we did not measure it this also benefited from the large contribution 82 9 of anammox to tin removal since the metabolic pathways of anammox bacteria directly oxidized nh4 n to n2 with no2 n as electron acceptor without n2o production okabe et al 2011 thus anammox pathway significantly enhanced the nitrogen removal performance of the snpr process significantly saving the demand for both carbon source and oxygen and reducing the n2o production 3 2 high level nutrient removal mechanism of this novel snpr system 3 2 1 variation of nutrients in typical operational cycles of the snpr sbr in different phases the analyses of typical operation cycle during phase ⅱ day 89 and phase ⅲ day 189 were used to explore the mechanism of nutrients transformation and removal in this novel snpr system fig 4 during the anaerobic stage 120 min the cod concentrations slightly varied with the domestic like wastewater when continuously fed into the reactor on day 89 and day 189 fig 4a and b while the phas and gly increased and decreased respectively fig 4c and d this indicated that the carbon sources in the influent were absorbed and stored as endogenous carbon by paos or gaos additionally the po4 3 p concentrations raised to 9 3 mg p l and 14 1 mg p l on day 89 and day 189 respectively although the influent po4 3 p concentrations elevated to 6 3 mg p l in phase ⅲ the po4 3 p release 10 8 mg p l at the anaerobic stage was significantly lower than the values 22 40 mg p l reported by previous studies on phosphorus removal from the domestic wastewaters with enriched paos population wang et al 2013 wang et al 2015b the reason was that the paos did not dominate in this snpr system while low po4 3 p release indicates that the small amount of po4 3 p had to be taken up in the anoxic stage leaving more electronic acceptor no2 n for anammox growth during the first 50 min of anoxic stage no2 n gradually increased to the maximum value 10 4 mg n l and 5 9 mg n l respectively on day 89 and day 189 when no3 n declined to zero fig 4a and b creating conditions for anammox reaction in the snpr system meanwhile the po4 3 p and nh4 n showed a clear decrease with the replenishment of gly and the degradation of phas fig 4c and d suggesting that the epd denitrifying dephosphatation and anammox reaction occurred simultaneously due to the consumption of anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation the maximum no2 n accumulation was lower in this snpr system than the enriched endogenous partial denitrification system that produced 16 4 mg n l no2 n in the anoxic stage ji et al 2017 in this period po4 3 p and no3 n were completely consumed leading to the anammox process being the dominant pathway of the nitrogen removal in the following 30 min notably when nh4 n remained around 2 1 mg n l the no2 n concentration was 0 5 mg n l at the end of the anoxic stage on day 189 while it was about 2 9 mg n l on day 89 fig 4a and b the enhanced nox n removal at the anoxic stage of phase ⅲ was due to the increase of po4 3 p uptake 4 8 mg p l interestingly although no3 n was expected to be produced with the anammox reaction the no3 n concentration was almost not detected at the end of the anoxic stage in phase ⅲ fig 4b the reason for this anomaly was that the no3 n from anammox reaction could be further used by denitrifying gaos or paos for producing no2 n or n2 thus this snpr system had a unique advantage of obtaining complete nitrogen removal with simultaneous p removal compared with the nitritation anammox system where the nitrate produced by nob and anammox processes usually remain in the effluent lotti et al 2014 3 2 2 stoichiometry based evaluations of cooperation and competition of denitrifying gaos denitrifying paos and anammox in order to further understand the cooperation and competition among denitrifying gaos denitrifying paos and anammox in the snpr system the nutrient and intracellular carbon transformation stoichiometry of the typical cycle were calculated on day 189 table 2 the δp δcod ratio 0 12 mol p mol c at the anaerobic stage of this system was far lower than the paos model value 0 5 mol p mol c reported by smolders et al 1994b however the δgly δcod ratio 1 16 mol c mol c and δphas δcod ratio 1 81 mol c mol c were close to that of the gaos 1 12 mol c mol c and 1 85 mol c mol c reported by zeng et al 2003 this indicated that the metabolism of gaos was dominant for storing exogenous carbon sources as phas driving the reduction of nitrate to nitrite and denitrifying dephosphatation in the following stage at the anoxic stage δgly δphas ratio 0 64 mol c mol c was higher than 0 42 mol c mol c of the paos model reported by smolders et al 1994a and lower than 0 75 mol c mol c of the gaos model reported by zeng et al 2003 suggesting that paos and gaos were both involved in the endogenous denitrifying process additionally δno3 n δphas ratio 0 25 mol n mol c and δno3 n δgly ratio 0 39 mol n mol c were consistent with the denitrifying gaos value 0 24 mol n mol c and 0 33 mol n mol c respectively reported by wang et al 2015b previous studies demonstrated that gaos were responsible for the high no2 n accumulation via reducing no3 n ji et al 2017 zeng et al 2003 facilitating the occurrence of anammox and the removal of nh4 n during the anoxic stage 1 c2h4o2 0 16nh4 0 2po4 3 0 96no3 0 16c5h7no2 1 2co2 0 2hpo3 1 4oh

denitrification was driven by both denitrifying gaos and paos based on the stoichiometry of the denitrifying phosphorus removal system shown in eq 1 henze et al 2001 the reduction of 1 00 mg of no3 n to n2 and no2 n to n2 could theoretically remove 1 410 mg and 0 846 mg of po4 3 p respectively as shown in fig 4b no3 n and nh4 n decreased by 18 5 mg n l and 10 9 mg n l respectively in a typical cycle of phase ⅲ when postulating that denitrifying paos could reduce no3 n to no2 n and further to n2 the maximum decrease in po4 3 p was 18 0 mg p l 1 410 mg p mg n 0 846 mg p mg n 18 5 mg n l 0 26 10 9 mg n l 0 846 mg p mg n 18 5 mg n l 0 26 10 9 mg n l 1 32 10 9 mg n l at the anoxic stage evidently the decreased po4 3 p 13 8 mg p l was lower than the maximum value demonstrating that the cooperation of anammox and denitrifying phosphorus removal processes were feasible with the competition for no2 n between annamox bacteria and paos in this novel snpr system 3 2 3 analysis of scanning electron microscopy sem and energy dispersive spectrometry eds on the endogenous denitrification granules the gaos metabolism played a main role in nitrite production for anammox reaction resulting in the decline of nitrate for denitrifying dephosphatation and a decrease of the phosphorus uptake during the anoxic stage although the phosphorus uptake activity kept at around 3 1 mg p gvss 1 h 1 in phase ⅲ fig 3a the effluent po4 3 p concentrations reduced to 0 3 mg p l between day 151 200 from 2 3 mg p l between day 90 150 while the po4 3 p removal efficiency enhanced by 34 0 fig 2b this indicated that other pathway contributed to po4 3 p removal and to achieve high phosphorus removal 94 2 in the snpr system fig 2b as evident in fig 5 a a large number of white crystalline precipitate cores were present within the endogenous denitrification granules on day 189 a similar phenomenon was found in the previous study mañas et al 2011 demonstrating that the white crystalline precipitate cores were mainly caused by hydroxyapatites hence the formation of phosphate precipitate allowed achieving the improved phosphorus removal in this snpr system notably fig 5b and d showed that phosphorus and calcium coexisted in the inorganic precipitates of endogenous denitrification granules while only a significant accumulation of phosphorus existed in the microorganism cells fig 5b and c this confirmed that p ca precipitated during the operation of the snpr system enhancing the phosphorus removal performance however previous studies demonstrated that about 45 of tp was removed by the p ca precipitation in the ebpr granular sludge mañas et al 2011 it was reported that the granules created suitable conditions for accelerating p metal precipitation such as 1 anaerobic condition naturally formed at the core of granular sludge wherein p and metal accumulation and a higher local ph typically occur due to the limitation of mass transfer resulted from the granules dense structure and 2 the sludge age of granules was relatively longer than the conventional activated sludge li et al 2015 wan et al 2015 therefore free ortho p commonly formed a precipitate with ca2 in granular sludge over floc sludge li et al 2015 which might also be the case in the snpr reactor and result in the decline of po4 3 p concentration at the end of anaerobic stage on day 168 200 on the other hand a large amount of phosphorus existed in eps fig 5b and e denotating that eps also contributed to the phosphorus removal in this system previous studies reported that due to the high adsorption capability eps contains many metal cations k mg2 and ca2 resulting in reservation of about 5 46 of phosphorus in sludge via the complexation of p metal wang et al 2015a zhang et al 2013a the above results concluded that the good p removal performance was obtained with a limited paos activity in phase ⅲ in addition such adsorption precipitation of p was beneficial to decrease the energy source for poly p synthetization via paos metabolism and displace the energy source to gaos metabolism li et al 2015 the adsorption precipitation of p not only alleviated paos competing electron acceptor with anammox but also guaranteed gaos producing no2 n for anammox growth 3 3 long term abundance dynamics of the functional bacterial species involved in the snpr sbr the microbial communities in the snpr sbr during phase ⅱ day 89 and phase ⅲ day 195 were characterized by 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis fig 6 in the phase ⅱ sample candidatus competibacter was 1 6 of the relative abundance fig 6 and was from a deep branching group of gammaproteobacteria identified as gaos rubio rincón et al 2017 dechloromonas which had the same phenotype of defluviicoccus known as another group of gaos comprised 0 4 of the relative abundance on day 89 nielsen et al 2019 gaos have the denitrifying capability under the anoxic conditions and produce high nitrite accumulation ji et al 2017 rubio rincón et al 2017 zeng et al 2003 notably candidatus competibacter and dechloromonas played a key role in the reduction of nitrate to nitrite driven by internal phas rubio rincón et al 2017 their high abundance and the observation of significant nitrite accumulation with the reduction of nitrate on day 89 fig 4a suggested that candidatus competibacter and dechloromonas might be responsible for the endogenous partial denitrification the genus candidatus accumulibacter from betaproteobacteria was detected as paos with an abundance of 0 9 in the phase ⅱ sample fig 6 some strains of candidatus accumulibacter have the capability to remove phosphorus under anoxic conditions using no3 n or no2 n instead of o2 as electron acceptors wang et al 2019b moreover paos can behave as gaos under p limiting conditions zhou et al 2008b the relatively lower abundance of candidatus accumulibacter illustrated that paos were inhibited potentially reducing the competition for nitrite and thereby accelerating the growth of anammox in phase ⅱ it was found that the abundances of candidatus kuenenia and candidatus brocadia anammox bacteria du et al 2017 were 0 6 and 1 1 respectively in phase ⅱ sample fig 6 compared with the abundance of paos the higher abundance of anammox bacteria 1 7 likely contributed to the recovery and stabilization of the anammox activity in phase ⅱ fig 3a in addition the anaerolineaceae uncultured within to chloroflexi was the prominent genus 50 2 55 4 in both samples fig 6 it was consistent with previous studies mielczarek et al 2012 which found that the widely distributed anaerolineaceae population was responsible for sludge granules after the influent po4 3 p concentration restored to 6 3 mg p l in phase ⅲ the candidatus accumulibacter paos abundance increased slightly to 1 1 on day 195 while the two gaos genera candidatus competibacter and dechloromonas decreased to 1 2 and 0 3 respectively fig 6 this was in agreement with the moderate gly consumption reduction in the anaerobic stage fig 4c and d as more poly p was degraded as an energy source for paos metabolism compared with phase ⅱ in this phase however the relatively lower abundance of paos was mainly due to the electron acceptor limitation resulting from the competition of gaos and anammox it indicates that the propagation of gaos over paos did not inevitably result in ebpr deterioration which was in line with the recent work from nielsen et al 2019 in this case the good performance of p removal was also benefited by the adsorption precipitation of p accompanied with biological phosphorus removal process in this snpr system fig 5 several studies also showed that the po4 3 p removal was stable and efficient despite the suppression of paos metabolism because of the significant contribution of p adsorption precipitation wang et al 2015a on the other hand anammox bacteria gained adequate no2 n for growth in the system due to the weak competition of paos for electron acceptors it was observed that the abundances of two anammox genera candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia increased to 6 5 and 1 9 respectively fig 6 suggesting that the anammox co existed with gaos and paos in this snpr system thus functional groups such as gaos anammox and paos could be synergistically responsible for the stable performance of this snpr system for energy efficient wastewater treatment 3 4 feasibility and reliability of 2 sludge snpr system for treating low c n wastewaters table 3 compares the performance of nutrient removal in the 2 sludge snpr system with other systems reported in the literature as shown in table 3 the conventional denitrification process without adding external carbon sources often achieves low nitrogen removal efficiencies 73 9 for low c n sewage even if through the nitrite pathway ma et al 2009 meanwhile before denitrification all the influent nh4 n needed to be oxidized to nox n in order to produce more energy consumption for aeration in this study only 60 of influent nh4 n was oxidized to no3 n and about 82 9 of tin removal was achieved through anammox pathway significantly saving the demand for both carbon source and oxygen typical nitritation anammox systems generally fail to achieve high level nitrogen removal 80 81 because of the excess nitrate produced by nob and anammox jiang et al 2018 zhang et al 2013b however the nitrogen removal performance of this novel snpr process was about 93 9 table 3 this was due to the fact that the generated nitrate was further reduced to nitrite for anammox reaction through endogenous partial denitrification significantly improving the nitrogen removal performance in this study on the other hand compared with traditional 2 sludge and 3 stage bnr process where high effluent nh4 n is usually detected zhou et al 2008a this technology has a unique advantage of achieving mainstream anammox with simultaneous denitrifying dephosphatation for the configuration of 2 sludge and 3 stage bnr system without being nitrified a considerable proportion of influent nh4 n with the first settled sludge stream was transferred directly to the anoxic reactor and remained in the effluent this resulted in relatively poor performance 74 6 88 2 of nitrogen removal while the phosphorus removal efficiency was up to 94 0 99 3 kuba et al 1996 zhao et al 2016 however the 2 sludge snpr system could successfully gain the high level nitrogen and phosphorus removal 93 9 and 94 2 respectively table 3 owing to the contribution of partial denitrification and anammox during the anoxic stage effluent nh4 n kept at a lower level of 2 1 mg n l in this study additionally compared with the 1 sludge snpr systems wang et al 2015b xu et al 2019 this novel 2 sludge snpr system achieved the higher nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiencies with a lower hrt table 3 kept aeration from consuming the endogenous carbon sources and enhanced the nitrogen removal contribution of anammox pathway considering c n ratio between 3 and 12 for real municipal wastewater cao et al 2017 ma et al 2009 this snpr process can be combined with the cod capture technology through which the organics sludge can be harvested for producing biomethane on the other hand a low c n 2 6 3 1 effluent of the high rate activated sludge system which was reported to capture carbon could be gained with a suitable solids retention time rahman et al 2016 in conclusion the organics contained in the effluent of the cod capture system were adequate to meet the demands of the snpr system used in this study the performance of this system needed to be further investigated for treating actual sewage overall at the steady period phase iii this system exhibited stable and high level of nitrogen and phosphorus removal 93 9 and 94 2 respectively clearly indicating that this novel snpr process has potential in mainstream wastewater treatment plants with minimum energy consumption and maximum energy recovery 4 conclusion the novel snpr system based on epd anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation was developed and successfully operated to treat sewage like wastewater for over 200 days the following main conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 with low c n ratio 2 9 a simultaneous high level nitrogen and phosphorus removal 93 9 and 94 2 respectively was achieved with the average effluent tin nh4 n and po4 3 p concentrations of 3 6 mg n l 2 1 mg n l and 0 3 mg p l respectively this indicated that the novel snpr process has promising prospect to obtain advanced nitrogen and phosphorus removal in the mainstream of wastewater treatment plants 2 at the steady period the anammox pathway in the novel snpr system occupied dominant position for total nitrogen removal with a significant percentage of 82 9 in addition p was mainly removed with no3 n as the electron acceptor via denitrifying dephosphatation thus this technology offers considerable savings in both carbon sources and oxygen demands 3 adsorption precipitation of phosphorus were involved in the snpr granular sludge which not only displaced the energy source to the metabolism of gaos for nitrite production but also alleviated paos competition for electron acceptor with anammox 4 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing analysis revealed that anammox 8 4 gaos 1 5 and paos 1 1 co existed in this novel snpr system potentially completing endogenous partial denitrification anammox and denitrifying dephosphatation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18301,microplastics can be found all over the world in the remotest regions and even in the arctic snow primary microplastic is either produced as microparticles or enters the natural environment already as microparticles whereas secondary microplastic is generated by fragmentation or abrasion of other products in the natural environment both pollute the global ecospheres and even enter the human food chain this study aims at the evaluation of the global publication output on both types of microplastic referring to absolute and contextual numbers only since 2006 the focus on the environmental burden led to an enormous increase of publications on mp while china usa and germany are leading players regarding the absolute numbers portugal chile and ireland are among the top countries when including socio economic features and research expenditures the responsibility for the big plastic waste producers can be shown by significantly correlating numbers of articles and the plastic waste generation albeit here china and usa fall behind however the biggest producers are not the most affected countries despite the strong international interest our study shows that many countries play no role at all in the publication landscape of mp for future planning it is necessary to extend the international collaborations to reach sustainable solutions for the whole planet

problems is the accumulation of plastic debris yu et al 2018 nowadays microplastics mp that is defined as particles smaller than 5 mm accumulates all over the world even in the remotest and abandoned parts unep 2016 it can be found even in the arctic snow bergmann et al 2019 the environmental immission is mainly caused by industrial sources landfill sewage or weathering van wezel et al 2016 also tire abrasion is proofed to be a major source entering ecosystems by atmospheric deposition and precipitation bertling et al 2018 poor plastic waste management or linear production is an important task when related to the effect of its concentration in ecosystems in particular as micro fraction there is a distinction to be made between primary and secondary microplastic meaning on one hand side industrial microplastics or particles entering the natural environment as fraction 5 mm such as washed out parts in sewage and on the other hand side fragmented abraded parts entering the natural environment as fraction 5 mm barnes et al 2009 boucher and froit 2017 primary microplastics originates e g from the production of cosmetics and clothing productions van wezel et al 2016 the major part of secondary microplastics results from tire abrasion fragmentation of macroplastics by mechanical action light weathering and embrittlement on beaches in sea water only a lower proportion is generated due to the retarded degradation at low temperatures and insolation andrady 2011 from the beginning of plastic mass production it has taken only a few decades to accumulate such a scale of microplastics in seawater on shorelines soil compartments and limnetic systems the ecological social and economic impacts are tremendous unep 2016 an estimated annual amount of more than 8 mill tons of plastic are discharged in the oceans jambeck et al 2015 particularly the northern pacific shows extremely high levels of microplastics shim and thomposon 2015 the toxicity of mp is mainly caused by residual monomers intermediates from degradation endocytosis and persistent organic pollutants pops that become bioavailable when ingested especially the toxic effects of absorbed pops are enormous e g pesticides and industrial chemicals like pcbs polychlorinated biphenyls microplastics can act as vectors of contaminants too carbery et al 2018 additionally the transport of invasive alien species and the distribution of algae can have negative impacts on ecosystems barnes et al 2009 not only the survival of aquatic animals is at risk the delivery of toxins via the food chain is crucial depending on the bio availability it effects also humans andrady 2011 many additives of plastic are hazardous to health and are responsible for carcinogenesis teuten et al 2009 nevertheless the levels of ingestion and adverse effects on human health are still widely unknown ritchie and roser 2018 un gesamp 2015 in this context further research efforts must be made many coherences of generation distribution accumulation and toxicity are still unknown recently the transport of mp from land to sea over riverine systems came more and more in the focus of research showing that the discharge varies enormously modelled hotspots are south east asia and oecd countries organization for economic co operation and development due to sewerage input van wijnen et al 2019 the discharge of microplastics in soils results mainly from atmospheric deposition allen et al 2019 agricultural application of organic fertilizers or plastic mulching with plastic film zhu et al 2019 despite their function of maintaining the biodiversity and the provision of nutrients the scientific focus on soil corradini et al 2019 and freshwater deposition is still very limited klein et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 also the foci on mp pollution in wastewater and sludge has just started an will gain importance in future research enfrin et al 2019 li et al 2019 additionally only little evaluation has been carried out regarding the economic impacts of mp pollution but it is said to be prohibitively expensive and technically infeasible to remove mp from the oceanic ecosystem house of commons 2016 therefore the manufacturing replacement or renunciation the reuse as well as the enforcement of ecological procedures products and waste strategies are mandatory objectives for future policies and research plans the challenge is not only to quantify and reduce the accumulation amount worldwide but also to invest in better understanding of the risks for health and environment these tasks are only manageable with combined forces of politics science society and producers and their successful coping demands global networks it is obligatory to prevent the deposition of plastics and microplastics and investigate in finding effective solutions based on waste prevention and integrative strategies in the meantime cleaning programs are mandatory to reduce the global burden of microplastics based on the tools provided by the bibliometric platform newqis new quality and quantity indices in science this study is the first bibliometric approach on microplastics in its entirety the aim of the study is to document and to assess the global research activity on mp up to now the findings provide background information to plan fund and implement necessary programs and its cross pollination networks 2 methods 2 1 search procedure and evaluation parameters this bibliometric analysis was carried out by means of methodological background of the bibliometric platform newqis that has been founded to provide scientists physicians funders and decision makers with profound information on a research field related to life science groneberg kloft et al 2009 newqis combines innovative scientometric analyses with state of the art visualization techniques for data collecting the online database web of science wos with its core collection was applied to retrieve all relevant publications worldwide citation analyses are feasible by means of the provided journal citation report jcr to compile a representative database all years as well as all indices listed in wos were searched for the following terms in the topic search mode microplastic or micro plastic or microscopic plastic or nanoplastic or nano plastic not microplacticit here the truncation was used to differ between the various terms the asterisk is a blind card for word versions to avoid false entries the term microplasticity had to be excluded hence a majority of adequate entries could be found and not related variants could be excluded subsequently metadata was stored in a ms access database that could be analyzed according to different evaluation parameters this study on the overall field of microplastics evaluated chronological and geographical patterns in combination with socio economic parameters and burden statistics to describe the development of research and their future trends that are important for all participating players key actors were identified and key demands formulated scientific foci and their changes over time were analyzed by evaluating the wos categories and the author s keywords the data for socio economic parameters was extracted from the world factbook cia 2017 the data of the plastic waste generation of the publishing countries originates from our world in data owid ritchie and roser 2018 data on the expenditures on research and development r d and the number of researchers per country came from the uis global database uis stat 2018 2 2 visualization of findings gastner and newman developed an algorithm based on the principal of density diffusion to distort geographic maps according to an evaluation parameter gastner and newman 2004 as result cartograms are generated that depict the countries in a different a parameter specific manner countries reaching high parameter values are zoomed in while countries with low values are zoomed out to preserve the basic structure of the world map mean values were assigned to the oceans and antarctica thus completely new pictures of the world map are created in this study the publication and citation numbers of mp papers as well as the socio economical parameters has been visualized by this methodology called density equalizing map projections demps the findings of the keyword analyses were visualized by the freely available application vosviewer resulting in cluster diagrams that show the most assigned terms and their combinations by size specific nodes and connecting lines van eck and waltman 2009 3 results from all wos core collection indexed data bases 3006 mp related publications n could be identified 3 1 research areas the publications originated from 85 different research fields wos categories the vast majority of these were either related to life sciences or engineering physics sciences only minor parts were law or arts and humanities studies analyzing the 10 most assigned subject areas s life science categories comprised environmental science and ecology s 1624 marine freshwater biology s 604 toxicology s 193 chemistry s 185 and water resources s 116 the focus on engineering physical science as umbrella term can be divided in engineering s 395 material sciences s 323 metallurgy metallurgical engineering s 176 and physics s 142 the research area science and technology other topics s 195 stood in between both main foci among the 10 most assigned subject areas life sciences were attributed 2722 times and the engineering physical sciences 1073 times the sum of assigned subject areas s has to be more that the number of publications in the data base because there are multi disciplinary articles according to the journals they were published in fig 1 depicts the main foci with the process of environmental accumulation for the articles focused on life science an average citation rate of cr 26 96 cr number of citations number of articles could be calculated and the engineering physical sciences articles reached an average citation rate of cr 16 75 the in between field science technology other topics reached cr 31 12 taken individually the publications related to environmental sciences and ecology has been cited on average cr 28 43 times fig 2 marine freshwater biology received a citation rate of cr 31 44 the varying citation rates are not always comparable because the citation behavior varies widely between the different research areas this adheres especially for the differences between life science and the physical technical fields that reached considerably lower values of approximately cr 10 with exception of engineering cr 27 99 the main focus of mp research was additionally evaluated by cluster analysis of the applied keywords here three clusters can be differentiated fig 3 3 2 high impact publications looking at the top 10 some authors became apparent contributing repeatedly among these publications richard c thompson university plymouth uk participated in n 5 tamara s galloway university exeter uk in n 4 and mark a browne university college dublin ireland in n 2 articles looking at the most publishing and most cited institutions c number of citations both the university plymouth n 65 c 7502 and the university exeter n 43 c 6027 occupied the first ranks whereas the university college of dublin only n 5 c 1301 articles contributed from the dublin articles ma browne alone reached with n 2 publication c 1078 citations both of these articles are worked out in collaboration with ts galloway and rc thompson from 10 top articles uk participated in 6 and the usa in 5 while the other countries contributes once table 1 beside uk and usa ireland japan and chile acted as first author country the average age of the top articles was 7 4 years the youngest is only 4 years old and achieved already 715 citations it is an article on the amount of plastic pollution in the oceans published in plos one eriksen et al 2014 the article that received the most recognition by citation metrics evaluates the accumulation and fragmentation of plastic barnes et al 2009 getting 1102 citations already eight of the top 10 articles are dealing with marine or shore ecosystems two publications address the toxicity for wildlife by ingestion of microplastics but also with focus on marine organisms so all of the top 10 articles are related to marine research and fall in the field of life science 3 2 1 chronological aspects the first articles related to mp that are listed in wos were published in 1964 until the 1990th the average publication number per year did not reach a two digit amount only in 1992 a number of 10 publications could be stated that remained in the two digit range until 2014 with n 108 publications the following years were characterized by an enormous increase that reached its maximum in 2018 with 736 publications in 2009 the number of the respective citations rose already extremely to c 2274 finding a next peak in 2011 with c 3953 and rising afterwards exponentially to the maximum of c 10 247 in 2015 the last years until 2019 were characterized by a sharp decline due to the missing time that is needed to reach the full recognition in the scientific community this process is described as cited half life chl and marks the time span that a publication needs to reach half of the citations fig 4 a usually the chl of life science publications lies between 7 and 8 years klingelhofer et al 2018 the first decades of our analysis were represented by publications on microplastics as material for production processes the first article in our database on microplastic as environmental pollutant was published in 2006 the study detected microplastics on coastal zones in singapore ng and obbard 2006 here an article of thompson et al should be added that was published already in 2004 it showed that plastic fragments in micro size are widespread in oceans thompson et al 2004 because the applied search term is not existing in the topic search this highly cited article had to be included manually the analysis of the development of the scientific thematic foci clearly indicates that between 1964 and 2010 the main research field originated from physical technical sciences with engineering material sciences and metallurgy metallurgical engineering as most important fields fig 4b 3 3 geographical aspects the majority of the overall data base of n 3006 publications could be assigned to countries of origin n 2916 of this only about one quarter of this data base n 757 has been worked out in international mostly bilateral co operations the most publishing country was china with n 505 articles on mp followed by the usa n 402 germany n 320 uk n 284 and italy n 208 in comparison to other studies in which russian publications could not identified to an international comparable degree gilyarevskii et al 2019 the russian contributions reached surprisingly rank 9 with a quantity of n 147 fig 5 a this ranking is based on values that were summed up over the whole evaluation period to determine the development of publication output over time additionally 3 year intervals have been analyzed from 1990 onwards fig 5b the change of the relative proportion of the most publishing countries showed a fluctuant progress of the chinese contribution similar to the us american proportion the relative proportions of germany uk italy france and netherlands varied also over time but on a lower level spain took its rank among the ten most publishing countries in the 2000er years and australia considerably started its scientific efforts on mp in the interval from 2008 onwards among the leading countries only the relative proportion of russian articles decreased significantly over time from the top 10 countries the majority mainly focused research on life science resulting from the time period after 2006 fig 6 with 84 47 italy was the publishing country that focused most frequently on life science followed by uk 79 62 spain 78 46 and the netherlands 75 81 the lowest proportion of life science research had russia with only 16 98 here physics engineering reached a percentage of 77 67 the wos category physics alone was focused in 31 45 the highest contribution amount in the field environmental science ecology could be attributed to the netherlands 52 56 and the uk 51 21 3 3 1 contextual factors the countries ranking of the performances on mp relating to their socio economic features varied

its core collection comprises different citation indices and with its jcr the opportunity of citation analyses is given however it has already been discussed that wos has a bias towards english language literature lillis and curry 2010 moreover the search tools are restricted to either title search or topic search that includes also abstract and keywords into the search procedure an elaborated topic search strategy minimizes the amount of false entries but cannot guarantee their complete exclusion on the other hand the title search does not include all listed entries therefore the chosen search approach is a carefully weighted procedure to minimize faulty entries and to build up a research data base as large as possible for a valid evaluation the comparability of research areas regarding their assessment of the recognition in the scientific community measured in citation parameters is limited too especially the physical and engineering fields are generally characterized by lower citation numbers caused by a different citation behavior in contrast to life science research our findings resulting from the countries citation patterns have to been seen and interpreted in this context otherwise a wrong picture would emerge leading to equally false conclusions normalization of the subject areas would be necessary for valid quality comparison indeed our interpretations are based mainly on descriptive findings without going quite deep into discussion quality aspects so that no normalization was necessary 4 2 research areas and chronological aspects there are two main topics that comprises the publication output on microplastics on the one hand primary microplastics partly being a manufactured material with excellent characteristics for a wide range of products the respective research focuses on its technical physical and application oriented aspects as well as in later years also on its impact as a component of industrial and domestic sewages on the other hand secondary microplastics is generated by fractionation of macroplastics respectively by abrasion or degradation processes the respective research mainly aims at the environmental impacts of microplastics litter although already in 1972 a study discussed the increasing risk of accumulating plastic debris on the surface of ocean water carpenter and smith jr 1972 the early years of research on microplastics were dominated by engineering and material research not until the 2000s auta et al 2017 the threat of the environmental accumulation of microplastics garnered more and more interest it is well recognized that the study of thompson et al from 2004 showing that microplastics are pollutants with global spread was the initial spark for the boosting of publications thompson et al 2004 apprehending its disastrous impact in maritime aquatic ecosystems the foci was initially set on it menace for oceans shores and beaches this is reflected by the ten most prolific articles that are picking up this problem in 2011 the declaration of the global plastics associations for solutions on marine litter was launched since then plastics organizations and allied industry associations form 40 countries around the world signed it building the so called global plastic alliance gpa marine litter solutions 2019 from this time onwards the average annual number of publications increased approximately 10 times up to now the governments of more and more nations became aware of the hazardous dimensions of microplastics litter and its global consequences subsequently national research funds were granted more and more frequently in 2016 the first international conference on microplastics took place in lanzarote spain resulting in the lanzarote declaration sam 2018 but only for a few years the researchers have been realized that the research efforts should not only be limited to marine ecosystems but have to extended to freshwater soils sewage and sludge due to their relevance for the microplastics accumulation in the whole biosphere it is to be expected that these problems will be more and more in focus of research in future times also in order to understand the overall mechanisms and impacts of environmental microplastic accumulation 4 3 geographical aspects ranking before the usa and the many european countries our findings of the absolute publication numbers reveal china as most publishing country on microplastics in contrast to previous studies klingelhofer et al 2018 here the chinese research was not only achieving leading ranks in the last decade but also as sum of the overall evaluation time period from 1964 until now however china s publications are not among the ten most prolific publications the most cited chinese article received 171 citations rank 65 and evaluated the surface water of the yangtze river zhao et al 2014 looking at the overall numbers of citations china fell back on rank 5 and reached only rank 52 regarding the average citation rate number of citations number of articles these characteristics of chinese publications could already be shown in previous studies klingelhofer et al 2018 there seems to be a comparatively little scientific recognition of chinese publications maybe this can be explained by the tremendous pressure on chinese scientists to publish and the ambitious governmental goals for the investment in research development oecd 2019 that are causing hasty publication processes china s leading position regarding the absolute numbers is also weakened by its ranking when including contextual factors especially the relation of publication numbers to the national plastic waste generation and the corresponding responsibility as well as to national socio economic features shed a different light on china s performance on microplastics with 29 4 is china leading the ranking of the global plastic production plasticseurope 2018 and is therewith also the largest emitter for marine plastics sam 2018 moreover china is still not participating in the clean seas campaign of the un environment programme that requests all players worldwide to prevent and reduce the pollution of oceans un environment programme 2018 but japan s and south korean s ranking 12th and 15th in absolute numbers efforts should assessed lower when including socio economic and waste generation parameters too if the 2018s agreement between china japan and south korea to assume a leading role in coping with microplastics as environmental pollutant will impact the research efforts as well the publication number should be increasing in the next years however the refusal along with the usa to sign the ocean plastic charter of the g7 states in 2018 seems not very promising for short coming effects on the contrary the japanese government declared that they are currently not prepared for such regulations due to necessary evaluation of other social and economic effects sam 2018 the usa clearly superseded by china ranked second regarding the absolute publication numbers generally its leading position within the scientific publication performance is caused by the high level scientific infrastructure and the high investigations in r d albeit this pattern is not reflected by the research on microplastics taking the plastic waste generation per country as parameter for the responsibility to act into account the usa can be found together with china in the last third of the ranking by definition the inclusion of the waste generation per capita places countries with high population numbers on front ranks of the evaluation albeit their high population numbers the usa ranks only 8th in this regard additionally usa as country with the highest gerd was shoved on the second last position when looking at the expenditures related to the number of microplastics articles threshold 10 articles here only japan ranks lower with the exception of the netherlands rank 10 the countries with the highest gerd being commonly also the most publishing countries cannot be found among the leading countries when evaluating their microplastics efforts by way of contrast the leading countries regarding the socio economic evaluations are portugal on first rank then in changing order chile ireland norway and slovenia in absolute terms these countries are ranked 13th 30th 22nd and 38th additionally slovenia norway and portugal are among the top 10 when evaluating the relation of publishing to the national plastic waste generation here chile and ireland still can be found in the upper half why are these nations leading when referring publication parameters to contextual parameters certainly the extremely fast shifting of research towards the research on microplastics contributed to their high rankings with the exception of norway all are positioned in the last quarter of the gerd ranking analysis threshold 10 articles the consequentially small denominators are pushing their publication performances forwards nearly all of the relevant publications are dealing with environmental issues with the exception of slovenia the countries have a relatively long mainland coastline that is vulnerable to plastic accumulation although slovenia has only a very short coast of only 40 km its location and characteristics at the eastern side of the northern part of the land locked adriatic sea exposes it to plastic accumulation gajst et al 2016 portugal norway and slovenia are among the ten european research funding countries of the joint programming initiative healthy and productive seas and oceans jpi oceans 2019 the awareness of chilean government for plastic litter is made clear when it became the first south american country that ban single use plastic bags gajst et al 2016 quite unusually russia took its rank among the leading ten nations in absolute numbers albeit with decreasing proportion the russian research is more focused on the characteristics of industrial microplastics while the environmental aspects are sparsely in focus accordingly the citation numbers are comparatively low looking at the contextual findings also the ukraine comes into view partly their publications were worked out during the soviet era in this time scientific research was carried out mostly within ministry institutions and the ukrainian research institutions had an outstanding role in the ussr national research council 1996 but even the development of the scientific infrastructure since the dissolution of the ussr was also based on the strategies of socialist ideals and was and still is characterized by the same foci networks and institutions only a slow process of detachment is recognizable national research council 1996 therefore it is not astonishing that like russia the scientific foci of ukraine were laid on physics material science and engineering their most important cooperatin partner is still russia showing some issues to think about these facts are only small hints for the explanation of countries awareness to act that reflects their research performances on microplastics of course the reasons and incentives for investment in microplastics research are regional very different very often they are dependent from the national economic infrastructure and the expenditures in r d with regard to the microplastics research the circumstances are unique due to the enormous recognition that this field gained in the last years worldwide leading to an extraordinary increase of publications that can be shown by the extremely short cited half life even so the greatest sufferers from microplastics pollution and accumulation are not the greatest emitters or producers of plastic waste however environmental factors are more important than anthropogenic factors for microplastics accumulation imhof et al 2017 at that the areas of anthropogenic activity and high density of population shows a significant correlation to the abundance of microplastics browne et al 2011 clark et al 2016 taking all this into account it becomes apparent that the liability to invest into the research on microplastics ought to be a global responsibility with strengthened indication to the most microplastic producing countries as well as the nations with bad waste management practices 5 conclusions the findings of this study on the global publication output on microplastics show a differing global landscape of the national intensions and performances not only absolute rankings are assessed but also their relation to contextual parameters with high informative value grant reliable data these approaches deliver a varying landscape of the publication output the preservation of the ecological balances the protection of life quality for all living beings and the averting of an unknown danger are mandatory for scientific goals worldwide therefore the accumulation of microplastic has to be avoided by a transition into a circular economy the main responsibility for basic and applied research aiming at the assessment of toxicity and for applied science aiming at prevention and conservation should be laid by the grand producers of plastic and plastic waste here policy makers funders and scientists all over the world are called upon to tackle this challenge wiser international networks have to be developed and strengthened to support also suchlike regions with only marginal scientific resources methodological standardization of regional approaches has to be granted new upcoming research foci as well as the development of strategies has a global significance and should overcome linear economics and secure sustainability declaration of competing interest

18301,microplastics can be found all over the world in the remotest regions and even in the arctic snow primary microplastic is either produced as microparticles or enters the natural environment already as microparticles whereas secondary microplastic is generated by fragmentation or abrasion of other products in the natural environment both pollute the global ecospheres and even enter the human food chain this study aims at the evaluation of the global publication output on both types of microplastic referring to absolute and contextual numbers only since 2006 the focus on the environmental burden led to an enormous increase of publications on mp while china usa and germany are leading players regarding the absolute numbers portugal chile and ireland are among the top countries when including socio economic features and research expenditures the responsibility for the big plastic waste producers can be shown by significantly correlating numbers of articles and the plastic waste generation albeit here china and usa fall behind however the biggest producers are not the most affected countries despite the strong international interest our study shows that many countries play no role at all in the publication landscape of mp for future planning it is necessary to extend the international collaborations to reach sustainable solutions for the whole planet

problems is the accumulation of plastic debris yu et al 2018 nowadays microplastics mp that is defined as particles smaller than 5 mm accumulates all over the world even in the remotest and abandoned parts unep 2016 it can be found even in the arctic snow bergmann et al 2019 the environmental immission is mainly caused by industrial sources landfill sewage or weathering van wezel et al 2016 also tire abrasion is proofed to be a major source entering ecosystems by atmospheric deposition and precipitation bertling et al 2018 poor plastic waste management or linear production is an important task when related to the effect of its concentration in ecosystems in particular as micro fraction there is a distinction to be made between primary and secondary microplastic meaning on one hand side industrial microplastics or particles entering the natural environment as fraction 5 mm such as washed out parts in sewage and on the other hand side fragmented abraded parts entering the natural environment as fraction 5 mm barnes et al 2009 boucher and froit 2017 primary microplastics originates e g from the production of cosmetics and clothing productions van wezel et al 2016 the major part of secondary microplastics results from tire abrasion fragmentation of macroplastics by mechanical action light weathering and embrittlement on beaches in sea water only a lower proportion is generated due to the retarded degradation at low temperatures and insolation andrady 2011 from the beginning of plastic mass production it has taken only a few decades to accumulate such a scale of microplastics in seawater on shorelines soil compartments and limnetic systems the ecological social and economic impacts are tremendous unep 2016 an estimated annual amount of more than 8 mill tons of plastic are discharged in the oceans jambeck et al 2015 particularly the northern pacific shows extremely high levels of microplastics shim and thomposon 2015 the toxicity of mp is mainly caused by residual monomers intermediates from degradation endocytosis and persistent organic pollutants pops that become bioavailable when ingested especially the toxic effects of absorbed pops are enormous e g pesticides and industrial chemicals like pcbs polychlorinated biphenyls microplastics can act as vectors of contaminants too carbery et al 2018 additionally the transport of invasive alien species and the distribution of algae can have negative impacts on ecosystems barnes et al 2009 not only the survival of aquatic animals is at risk the delivery of toxins via the food chain is crucial depending on the bio availability it effects also humans andrady 2011 many additives of plastic are hazardous to health and are responsible for carcinogenesis teuten et al 2009 nevertheless the levels of ingestion and adverse effects on human health are still widely unknown ritchie and roser 2018 un gesamp 2015 in this context further research efforts must be made many coherences of generation distribution accumulation and toxicity are still unknown recently the transport of mp from land to sea over riverine systems came more and more in the focus of research showing that the discharge varies enormously modelled hotspots are south east asia and oecd countries organization for economic co operation and development due to sewerage input van wijnen et al 2019 the discharge of microplastics in soils results mainly from atmospheric deposition allen et al 2019 agricultural application of organic fertilizers or plastic mulching with plastic film zhu et al 2019 despite their function of maintaining the biodiversity and the provision of nutrients the scientific focus on soil corradini et al 2019 and freshwater deposition is still very limited klein et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 also the foci on mp pollution in wastewater and sludge has just started an will gain importance in future research enfrin et al 2019 li et al 2019 additionally only little evaluation has been carried out regarding the economic impacts of mp pollution but it is said to be prohibitively expensive and technically infeasible to remove mp from the oceanic ecosystem house of commons 2016 therefore the manufacturing replacement or renunciation the reuse as well as the enforcement of ecological procedures products and waste strategies are mandatory objectives for future policies and research plans the challenge is not only to quantify and reduce the accumulation amount worldwide but also to invest in better understanding of the risks for health and environment these tasks are only manageable with combined forces of politics science society and producers and their successful coping demands global networks it is obligatory to prevent the deposition of plastics and microplastics and investigate in finding effective solutions based on waste prevention and integrative strategies in the meantime cleaning programs are mandatory to reduce the global burden of microplastics based on the tools provided by the bibliometric platform newqis new quality and quantity indices in science this study is the first bibliometric approach on microplastics in its entirety the aim of the study is to document and to assess the global research activity on mp up to now the findings provide background information to plan fund and implement necessary programs and its cross pollination networks 2 methods 2 1 search procedure and evaluation parameters this bibliometric analysis was carried out by means of methodological background of the bibliometric platform newqis that has been founded to provide scientists physicians funders and decision makers with profound information on a research field related to life science groneberg kloft et al 2009 newqis combines innovative scientometric analyses with state of the art visualization techniques for data collecting the online database web of science wos with its core collection was applied to retrieve all relevant publications worldwide citation analyses are feasible by means of the provided journal citation report jcr to compile a representative database all years as well as all indices listed in wos were searched for the following terms in the topic search mode microplastic or micro plastic or microscopic plastic or nanoplastic or nano plastic not microplacticit here the truncation was used to differ between the various terms the asterisk is a blind card for word versions to avoid false entries the term microplasticity had to be excluded hence a majority of adequate entries could be found and not related variants could be excluded subsequently metadata was stored in a ms access database that could be analyzed according to different evaluation parameters this study on the overall field of microplastics evaluated chronological and geographical patterns in combination with socio economic parameters and burden statistics to describe the development of research and their future trends that are important for all participating players key actors were identified and key demands formulated scientific foci and their changes over time were analyzed by evaluating the wos categories and the author s keywords the data for socio economic parameters was extracted from the world factbook cia 2017 the data of the plastic waste generation of the publishing countries originates from our world in data owid ritchie and roser 2018 data on the expenditures on research and development r d and the number of researchers per country came from the uis global database uis stat 2018 2 2 visualization of findings gastner and newman developed an algorithm based on the principal of density diffusion to distort geographic maps according to an evaluation parameter gastner and newman 2004 as result cartograms are generated that depict the countries in a different a parameter specific manner countries reaching high parameter values are zoomed in while countries with low values are zoomed out to preserve the basic structure of the world map mean values were assigned to the oceans and antarctica thus completely new pictures of the world map are created in this study the publication and citation numbers of mp papers as well as the socio economical parameters has been visualized by this methodology called density equalizing map projections demps the findings of the keyword analyses were visualized by the freely available application vosviewer resulting in cluster diagrams that show the most assigned terms and their combinations by size specific nodes and connecting lines van eck and waltman 2009 3 results from all wos core collection indexed data bases 3006 mp related publications n could be identified 3 1 research areas the publications originated from 85 different research fields wos categories the vast majority of these were either related to life sciences or engineering physics sciences only minor parts were law or arts and humanities studies analyzing the 10 most assigned subject areas s life science categories comprised environmental science and ecology s 1624 marine freshwater biology s 604 toxicology s 193 chemistry s 185 and water resources s 116 the focus on engineering physical science as umbrella term can be divided in engineering s 395 material sciences s 323 metallurgy metallurgical engineering s 176 and physics s 142 the research area science and technology other topics s 195 stood in between both main foci among the 10 most assigned subject areas life sciences were attributed 2722 times and the engineering physical sciences 1073 times the sum of assigned subject areas s has to be more that the number of publications in the data base because there are multi disciplinary articles according to the journals they were published in fig 1 depicts the main foci with the process of environmental accumulation for the articles focused on life science an average citation rate of cr 26 96 cr number of citations number of articles could be calculated and the engineering physical sciences articles reached an average citation rate of cr 16 75 the in between field science technology other topics reached cr 31 12 taken individually the publications related to environmental sciences and ecology has been cited on average cr 28 43 times fig 2 marine freshwater biology received a citation rate of cr 31 44 the varying citation rates are not always comparable because the citation behavior varies widely between the different research areas this adheres especially for the differences between life science and the physical technical fields that reached considerably lower values of approximately cr 10 with exception of engineering cr 27 99 the main focus of mp research was additionally evaluated by cluster analysis of the applied keywords here three clusters can be differentiated fig 3 3 2 high impact publications looking at the top 10 some authors became apparent contributing repeatedly among these publications richard c thompson university plymouth uk participated in n 5 tamara s galloway university exeter uk in n 4 and mark a browne university college dublin ireland in n 2 articles looking at the most publishing and most cited institutions c number of citations both the university plymouth n 65 c 7502 and the university exeter n 43 c 6027 occupied the first ranks whereas the university college of dublin only n 5 c 1301 articles contributed from the dublin articles ma browne alone reached with n 2 publication c 1078 citations both of these articles are worked out in collaboration with ts galloway and rc thompson from 10 top articles uk participated in 6 and the usa in 5 while the other countries contributes once table 1 beside uk and usa ireland japan and chile acted as first author country the average age of the top articles was 7 4 years the youngest is only 4 years old and achieved already 715 citations it is an article on the amount of plastic pollution in the oceans published in plos one eriksen et al 2014 the article that received the most recognition by citation metrics evaluates the accumulation and fragmentation of plastic barnes et al 2009 getting 1102 citations already eight of the top 10 articles are dealing with marine or shore ecosystems two publications address the toxicity for wildlife by ingestion of microplastics but also with focus on marine organisms so all of the top 10 articles are related to marine research and fall in the field of life science 3 2 1 chronological aspects the first articles related to mp that are listed in wos were published in 1964 until the 1990th the average publication number per year did not reach a two digit amount only in 1992 a number of 10 publications could be stated that remained in the two digit range until 2014 with n 108 publications the following years were characterized by an enormous increase that reached its maximum in 2018 with 736 publications in 2009 the number of the respective citations rose already extremely to c 2274 finding a next peak in 2011 with c 3953 and rising afterwards exponentially to the maximum of c 10 247 in 2015 the last years until 2019 were characterized by a sharp decline due to the missing time that is needed to reach the full recognition in the scientific community this process is described as cited half life chl and marks the time span that a publication needs to reach half of the citations fig 4 a usually the chl of life science publications lies between 7 and 8 years klingelhofer et al 2018 the first decades of our analysis were represented by publications on microplastics as material for production processes the first article in our database on microplastic as environmental pollutant was published in 2006 the study detected microplastics on coastal zones in singapore ng and obbard 2006 here an article of thompson et al should be added that was published already in 2004 it showed that plastic fragments in micro size are widespread in oceans thompson et al 2004 because the applied search term is not existing in the topic search this highly cited article had to be included manually the analysis of the development of the scientific thematic foci clearly indicates that between 1964 and 2010 the main research field originated from physical technical sciences with engineering material sciences and metallurgy metallurgical engineering as most important fields fig 4b 3 3 geographical aspects the majority of the overall data base of n 3006 publications could be assigned to countries of origin n 2916 of this only about one quarter of this data base n 757 has been worked out in international mostly bilateral co operations the most publishing country was china with n 505 articles on mp followed by the usa n 402 germany n 320 uk n 284 and italy n 208 in comparison to other studies in which russian publications could not identified to an international comparable degree gilyarevskii et al 2019 the russian contributions reached surprisingly rank 9 with a quantity of n 147 fig 5 a this ranking is based on values that were summed up over the whole evaluation period to determine the development of publication output over time additionally 3 year intervals have been analyzed from 1990 onwards fig 5b the change of the relative proportion of the most publishing countries showed a fluctuant progress of the chinese contribution similar to the us american proportion the relative proportions of germany uk italy france and netherlands varied also over time but on a lower level spain took its rank among the ten most publishing countries in the 2000er years and australia considerably started its scientific efforts on mp in the interval from 2008 onwards among the leading countries only the relative proportion of russian articles decreased significantly over time from the top 10 countries the majority mainly focused research on life science resulting from the time period after 2006 fig 6 with 84 47 italy was the publishing country that focused most frequently on life science followed by uk 79 62 spain 78 46 and the netherlands 75 81 the lowest proportion of life science research had russia with only 16 98 here physics engineering reached a percentage of 77 67 the wos category physics alone was focused in 31 45 the highest contribution amount in the field environmental science ecology could be attributed to the netherlands 52 56 and the uk 51 21 3 3 1 contextual factors the countries ranking of the performances on mp relating to their socio economic features varied

bibliometric approaches have methodological limitations according to the characteristics of the chosen database for this study the wos was applied to retrieve the meta data for the further analyses its core collection comprises different citation indices and with its jcr the opportunity of citation analyses is given however it has already been discussed that wos has a bias towards english language literature lillis and curry 2010 moreover the search tools are restricted to either title search or topic search that includes also abstract and keywords into the search procedure an elaborated topic search strategy minimizes the amount of false entries but cannot guarantee their complete exclusion on the other hand the title search does not include all listed entries therefore the chosen search approach is a carefully weighted procedure to minimize faulty entries and to build up a research data base as large as possible for a valid evaluation the comparability of research areas regarding their assessment of the recognition in the scientific community measured in citation parameters is limited too especially the physical and engineering fields are generally characterized by lower citation numbers caused by a different citation behavior in contrast to life science research our findings resulting from the countries citation patterns have to been seen and interpreted in this context otherwise a wrong picture would emerge leading to equally false conclusions normalization of the subject areas would be necessary for valid quality comparison indeed our interpretations are based mainly on descriptive findings without going quite deep into discussion quality aspects so that no normalization was necessary 4 2 research areas and chronological aspects there are two main topics that comprises the publication output on microplastics on the one hand primary microplastics partly being a manufactured material with excellent characteristics for a wide range of products the respective research focuses on its technical physical and application oriented aspects as well as in later years also on its impact as a component of industrial and domestic sewages on the other hand secondary microplastics is generated by fractionation of macroplastics respectively by abrasion or degradation processes the respective research mainly aims at the environmental impacts of microplastics litter although already in 1972 a study discussed the increasing risk of accumulating plastic debris on the surface of ocean water carpenter and smith jr 1972 the early years of research on microplastics were dominated by engineering and material research not until the 2000s auta et al 2017 the threat of the environmental accumulation of microplastics garnered more and more interest it is well recognized that the study of thompson et al from 2004 showing that microplastics are pollutants with global spread was the initial spark for the boosting of publications thompson et al 2004 apprehending its disastrous impact in maritime aquatic ecosystems the foci was initially set on it menace for oceans shores and beaches this is reflected by the ten most prolific articles that are picking up this problem in 2011 the declaration of the global plastics associations for solutions on marine litter was launched since then plastics organizations and allied industry associations form 40 countries around the world signed it building the so called global plastic alliance gpa marine litter solutions 2019 from this time onwards the average annual number of publications increased approximately 10 times up to now the governments of more and more nations became aware of the hazardous dimensions of microplastics litter and its global consequences subsequently national research funds were granted more and more frequently in 2016 the first international conference on microplastics took place in lanzarote spain resulting in the lanzarote declaration sam 2018 but only for a few years the researchers have been realized that the research efforts should not only be limited to marine ecosystems but have to extended to freshwater soils sewage and sludge due to their relevance for the microplastics accumulation in the whole biosphere it is to be expected that these problems will be more and more in focus of research in future times also in order to understand the overall mechanisms and impacts of environmental microplastic accumulation 4 3 geographical aspects ranking before the usa and the many european countries our findings of the absolute publication numbers reveal china as most publishing country on microplastics in contrast to previous studies klingelhofer et al 2018 here the chinese research was not only achieving leading ranks in the last decade but also as sum of the overall evaluation time period from 1964 until now however china s publications are not among the ten most prolific publications the most cited chinese article received 171 citations rank 65 and evaluated the surface water of the yangtze river zhao et al 2014 looking at the overall numbers of citations china fell back on rank 5 and reached only rank 52 regarding the average citation rate number of citations number of articles these characteristics of chinese publications could already be shown in previous studies klingelhofer et al 2018 there seems to be a comparatively little scientific recognition of chinese publications maybe this can be explained by the tremendous pressure on chinese scientists to publish and the ambitious governmental goals for the investment in research development oecd 2019 that are causing hasty publication processes china s leading position regarding the absolute numbers is also weakened by its ranking when including contextual factors especially the relation of publication numbers to the national plastic waste generation and the corresponding responsibility as well as to national socio economic features shed a different light on china s performance on microplastics with 29 4 is china leading the ranking of the global plastic production plasticseurope 2018 and is therewith also the largest emitter for marine plastics sam 2018 moreover china is still not participating in the clean seas campaign of the un environment programme that requests all players worldwide to prevent and reduce the pollution of oceans un environment programme 2018 but japan s and south korean s ranking 12th and 15th in absolute numbers efforts should assessed lower when including socio economic and waste generation parameters too if the 2018s agreement between china japan and south korea to assume a leading role in coping with microplastics as environmental pollutant will impact the research efforts as well the publication number should be increasing in the next years however the refusal along with the usa to sign the ocean plastic charter of the g7 states in 2018 seems not very promising for short coming effects on the contrary the japanese government declared that they are currently not prepared for such regulations due to necessary evaluation of other social and economic effects sam 2018 the usa clearly superseded by china ranked second regarding the absolute publication numbers generally its leading position within the scientific publication performance is caused by the high level scientific infrastructure and the high investigations in r d albeit this pattern is not reflected by the research on microplastics taking the plastic waste generation per country as parameter for the responsibility to act into account the usa can be found together with china in the last third of the ranking by definition the inclusion of the waste generation per capita places countries with high population numbers on front ranks of the evaluation albeit their high population numbers the usa ranks only 8th in this regard additionally usa as country with the highest gerd was shoved on the second last position when looking at the expenditures related to the number of microplastics articles threshold 10 articles here only japan ranks lower with the exception of the netherlands rank 10 the countries with the highest gerd being commonly also the most publishing countries cannot be found among the leading countries when evaluating their microplastics efforts by way of contrast the leading countries regarding the socio economic evaluations are portugal on first rank then in changing order chile ireland norway and slovenia in absolute terms these countries are ranked 13th 30th 22nd and 38th additionally slovenia norway and portugal are among the top 10 when evaluating the relation of publishing to the national plastic waste generation here chile and ireland still can be found in the upper half why are these nations leading when referring publication parameters to contextual parameters certainly the extremely fast shifting of research towards the research on microplastics contributed to their high rankings with the exception of norway all are positioned in the last quarter of the gerd ranking analysis threshold 10 articles the consequentially small denominators are pushing their publication performances forwards nearly all of the relevant publications are dealing with environmental issues with the exception of slovenia the countries have a relatively long mainland coastline that is vulnerable to plastic accumulation although slovenia has only a very short coast of only 40 km its location and characteristics at the eastern side of the northern part of the land locked adriatic sea exposes it to plastic accumulation gajst et al 2016 portugal norway and slovenia are among the ten european research funding countries of the joint programming initiative healthy and productive seas and oceans jpi oceans 2019 the awareness of chilean government for plastic litter is made clear when it became the first south american country that ban single use plastic bags gajst et al 2016 quite unusually russia took its rank among the leading ten nations in absolute numbers albeit with decreasing proportion the russian research is more focused on the characteristics of industrial microplastics while the environmental aspects are sparsely in focus accordingly the citation numbers are comparatively low looking at the contextual findings also the ukraine comes into view partly their publications were worked out during the soviet era in this time scientific research was carried out mostly within ministry institutions and the ukrainian research institutions had an outstanding role in the ussr national research council 1996 but even the development of the scientific infrastructure since the dissolution of the ussr was also based on the strategies of socialist ideals and was and still is characterized by the same foci networks and institutions only a slow process of detachment is recognizable national research council 1996 therefore it is not astonishing that like russia the scientific foci of ukraine were laid on physics material science and engineering their most important cooperatin partner is still russia showing some issues to think about these facts are only small hints for the explanation of countries awareness to act that reflects their research performances on microplastics of course the reasons and incentives for investment in microplastics research are regional very different very often they are dependent from the national economic infrastructure and the expenditures in r d with regard to the microplastics research the circumstances are unique due to the enormous recognition that this field gained in the last years worldwide leading to an extraordinary increase of publications that can be shown by the extremely short cited half life even so the greatest sufferers from microplastics pollution and accumulation are not the greatest emitters or producers of plastic waste however environmental factors are more important than anthropogenic factors for microplastics accumulation imhof et al 2017 at that the areas of anthropogenic activity and high density of population shows a significant correlation to the abundance of microplastics browne et al 2011 clark et al 2016 taking all this into account it becomes apparent that the liability to invest into the research on microplastics ought to be a global responsibility with strengthened indication to the most microplastic producing countries as well as the nations with bad waste management practices 5 conclusions the findings of this study on the global publication output on microplastics show a differing global landscape of the national intensions and performances not only absolute rankings are assessed but also their relation to contextual parameters with high informative value grant reliable data these approaches deliver a varying landscape of the publication output the preservation of the ecological balances the protection of life quality for all living beings and the averting of an unknown danger are mandatory for scientific goals worldwide therefore the accumulation of microplastic has to be avoided by a transition into a circular economy the main responsibility for basic and applied research aiming at the assessment of toxicity and for applied science aiming at prevention and conservation should be laid by the grand producers of plastic and plastic waste here policy makers funders and scientists all over the world are called upon to tackle this challenge wiser international networks have to be developed and strengthened to support also suchlike regions with only marginal scientific resources methodological standardization of regional approaches has to be granted new upcoming research foci as well as the development of strategies has a global significance and should overcome linear economics and secure sustainability declaration of competing interest

18302,absorbance and fluorescence based optical parameters are commonly used as surrogates in engineered systems but there is no systematic approach for selecting robust parameters this study develops a methodology that is applied to a case study of differentiating wastewater effluent organic matter from naturally derived organic matter the methodology defines criteria to identify optical parameters that could detect statistically significant compositional differences in organic matter independent of organic matter concentration and measure fluorescence based parameters with low susceptibility to inner filter effects the criteria were applied to 26 parameters that were measured for 11 pairs of source water and conventionally treated wastewater samples collected from sites with varied spatial and temporal conditions only two parameters apparent fluorescence quantum yield measured at excitation 370 nm and fluorescence peak ratio a t met the criteria across all sites these results demonstrate and encourage an objective and robust process for selecting optical surrogates for organic matter characterization graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluorescence quantum yield absorbance dom efom water reuse 1 introduction the use of optical parameters i e absorbance and fluorescence for the measurement and characterization of dissolved organic matter dom in natural and engineered environments has gained much attention over the past 20 years these techniques are used in part due to their high sensitivity simplicity of use and importantly high frequency of measurement when applied to in situ sensor based technology khamis et al 2018 li et al 2016 ruhala and zarnetske 2017 absorbance spectroscopy measures chromophoric dom cdom which is the optically active fraction of dom that absorbs light absorbance measurements were initially identified as a surrogate for dom concentration i e dissolved organic carbon doc and have developed into surrogates for dom reactivity and composition fluorescence spectroscopy measures the fraction of cdom that emits light i e fluorescent dom fdom only a fraction of dom is fdom and the apparent fluorescence quantum yields for dom are low 1 3 the spectral signatures of cdom and fdom are conventionally collected on bench scale instruments across a wide range of wavelengths 200 nm up to 600 nm although in situ absorbance sensors can measure spectra current in situ fluorescence sensors collect single excitation emission wavelength combinations with broad bandpass resolution downing et al 2012 watras et al 2011 typically fdom and cdom signatures are interpreted using an ever expanding range of optical parameters which extract a quantitative measure of specific spectral characteristics for example both specific uv absorbance suva at 254 nm suva254 and the fluorescence index have been correlated to dom aromaticity mcknight et al 2001 weishaar et al 2003 optical surrogates have been used to characterize dom removal and trace organic contaminant transformation in conventional drinking water treatment anumol et al 2015 bieroza et al 2011 2009 carstea et al 2010 edzwald et al 1985 korak et al 2015 roccaro et al 2009 sanchez et al 2014 2013 advanced oxidation processes gerrity et al 2012 wert et al 2009 and water reuse systems baker 2001 baker et al 2004 hambly et al 2010 henderson et al 2009 korshin et al 2018 murphy et al 2011 given the increased discharge and assimilation of treated wastewater into natural and engineered water systems optical parameters are being increasingly integrated into water reuse systems to monitor the water quality reuse of wastewater for potable consumption can occur when waste discharge is mixed intentionally planned water reuse or unintentionally de facto water reuse with natural source water and then further treated for drinking water use in scenarios where wastewater effluent is blended with a natural source water either de facto or planned the observed mixture of dom is composed of both naturally derived organic matter domnatural and wastewater derived organic matter commonly referred to as effluent organic matter efom as represented by eq 1 1 dom domnatural efom domnatural is present in natural waters and is a mixture of soluble degraded plant animal and microbial derived organic material thurman and malcolm 1981 on the other hand efom is a mixture of dom originating from water supplies domnatural residual soluble microbial products smps produced during biological wastewater treatment and trace levels of organic contaminants michael kordatou et al 2015 tran et al 2015 in terms of mass contribution smps in efom dominate over domnatural on a carbon basis and organic contaminants contribute minimally to the overall mass balance shon et al 2006 wastewater treatment operational parameters such as sludge retention time organic loading rate hydraulic retention time and process temperature alter the efom concentration and physicochemical properties michael kordatou et al 2015 shon et al 2006 in natural and engineered reuse systems the reactivity of dom depends on the contributions of efom and domnatural drewes and fox 2000 hu et al 2016 compositional changes in dom impact the treatment efficiency and product water quality of water treatment plants hu et al 2016 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 efom is broadly viewed as a surrogate for constituents that may decrease treatment performance or have the potential to threaten human and aquatic health a public concern with reusing wastewater for potable use is the potential for undesirable constituents present in efom or formed during treatment of efom e g oxidation or disinfection byproducts to remain after treatment continuously monitoring changes in dom composition and quantifying the contribution of efom would enable tracking of efom assimilation into natural waters that are used by drinking water treatment facilities which would allow for better management of treatment processes impacted by de facto water reuse numerous optical parameters have been developed using absorbance and fluorescence measurements occasionally in conjunction with doc concentration to differentiate efom from domnatural for example the maximum or integrated fluorescence intensities within pre defined excitation and emission regions coble 1996 and components identified in parallel factor analysis parafac modeling have been used as optical surrogates for efom or organic contaminants coexisting with efom baker 2001 baker et al 2014 carstea et al 2010 hur and cho 2012 ishii and boyer 2012 li et al 2014 riopel et al 2014 sgroi et al 2017 wells et al 2017 absorbance based parameters including suva254 spectral slope and others have been used for dom source discrimination as reviewed by li and hur 2017 while some studies have assessed a group of parameters e g peak t suva fluorescence index for one environmental system others have applied one parameter e g peak t to many environmental systems as reviewed by carstea et al 2016 and henderson et al 2009 a common approach and justification for optical parameter selection is to rely on correlations observed in previous studies that have been conducted in a specific experimental context for example peak t has been widely used as a surrogate for efom since marine studies observed protein like dom more specifically amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan to fluoresce in the same region as peak t yamashita and tanoue 2003 however it has been shown that the measured fluorescence of peak t may not be unique to protein like dom due to polyphenols and the fluorescence signature of these amino acids is strongly quenched by other dom moieties maie et al 2007 wang et al 2015 another study by murphy and co workers demonstrated that similar fluorescence moieties appear ubiquitously in diverse ecosystems and fluorescence signatures used to describe genesis i e microbial vs terrestrial can be manipulated in the lab through photoirradiation and yield contradictory interpretations murphy et al 2018 findings like these have added to the ongoing debate of why dom exhibits its characteristic absorbance and fluorescence signatures with hypotheses including a superposition of non interacting molecules and charge transfer complexes mckay et al 2018 schendorf et al 2019 sharpless and blough 2014 wünsch et al 2017 this broader debate questions the reliance on selecting optical parameters based on previous study specific findings compared to selecting parameters based on the objective utility until the fundamentals of dom photophysics are better understood currently there exists no standard approach to justify the selection of optical parameters for data interpretation which has led to a lack of consistency between studies and a segmented body of research in response this study developed a methodology to systematically assess the robustness of optical parameters for the application of differentiating efom from domnatural for this purpose 11 pairs of wastewater effluent and corresponding surface water samples were collected from sites throughout the united states a total of 26 optical parameters shown in tables s 3 and s 4 were evaluated against quantitative performance criteria application of the methodology identified a pair of optical surrogates with the potential to be effective monitoring tools in reuse systems although the application of the methodology is specific to water reuse the framework could be adapted to other scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection eleven pairs of secondary or tertiary treated wastewater and their corresponding source water were collected from six sites around the united states three sites were sampled twice and one site was sampled at two different points along the wastewater treatment train all wastewater plants used biological treatment processes i e activated sludge or trickling filters and samples were collected after secondary or tertiary treatment tables s 1 source water herein defined as the water from which the wastewater was originally derived and reported through personal correspondence to be minimally impacted by anthropogenic sources was either collected upstream of the wastewater treatment facility or at the influent of the drinking water treatment facility sites are identified by number codes to preserve their anonymity additional information on the sites can be found in supporting information si section 1 2 2 analytical methods samples were filtered with rinsed 0 45 μm nylon filters vwr pa to remove particulates and microorganisms and stored at 4 c to inhibit further microbial activity baker et al 2014 doc was measured using sievers m5310c total organic carbon analyzer suez co using a uv persulfate wet oxidation organic carbon method bulk water quality analyses including doc alkalinity ph nitrate and nitrite are presented in table 1 absorbance scans were measured in 1 cm quartz cuvettes from 200 to 800 nm in 1 nm increments using a cary 100 bio uv vis spectrophotometer agilent technologies ca and were baseline corrected absorbance data were used to calculate a range of optical parameters tables s 3 and s 4 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were collected for excitation wavelengths from 240 to 500 nm in 10 nm increments and for emission wavelengths from 300 to 700 nm in 2 nm increments in triplicate using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba nj following already reported methods mckay et al 2018 the integration time was 0 25 s and a 5 nm bandpass was used for excitation and emission monochromators fluorescence data were corrected following protocols provided in murphy et al 2010 eems were blank subtracted inner filter corrected using the absorbance spectra unless specifically noted and raman normalized using matlab mathworks ma corrected fluorescence data were used to calculate a variety of optical parameters summarized in tables s 3 and s 4 apparent fluorescence quantum yield values were calculated at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm using quinine sulfate in 0 1 n sulfuric acid as a standard following the methods in mckay et al 2018 2 3 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism 7 software graphpad software ca or minitab software version 17 minitab llc pa the uncertainties of optical parameters are reported as the coefficient of variation cv which is the standard deviation of replicate measurements divided by the mean in all boxplots boxes represent the interquartile range whiskers represent the maximum and minimum and the interior band shows the median value 2 4 performance criteria for optical parameter selection to objectively and quantitatively assess the ability of optical parameters see table s 3 and s 4 to distinguish efom from domnatural this study evaluated each parameter against performance based criteria to determine the most promising optical surrogates table 2 this approach differs from other studies where optical parameters are selected based on previous studies rather than demonstrating reliability to answer study specific questions the criteria define that optical parameters must 1 be able to track compositional differences in organic matter independent of dom concentration 2 reliably differentiate efom from domnatural that is assumed to be minimally impacted by efom and 3 have low susceptibility to sample specific optical artifacts i e inner filter effects which is needed for in situ monitoring applications for the criteria six assessment tools a f were defined table 2 section 3 of the si provides detailed explanations and example calculations for the objective criteria 2 4 1 criterion 1 optical parameter is a surrogate for dom composition criterion 1 defines that the optical parameter should be an intrinsic parameter as opposed to an extrinsic parameter intrinsic parameters are able to measure differences in dom composition independent of concentration whereas extrinsic parameters are impacted by changes in both dom composition and concentration this criterion was prioritized because in dynamic systems such as water treatment systems where carbon concentrations are in continuous flux due to both engineered and natural processes it becomes difficult to interpret if changes in an extrinsic parameter are attributed to changes in dom composition or concentration table 3 lists the intrinsic parameters evaluated in this study with definitions provided in tables s 4 a well known approach to isolate compositional characteristics of dom is to normalize the absorbance or fluorescence peak intensity to the doc concentration producing suva and specific peak intensities respectively another method is to calculate the ratios of multiple absorbance e g e2 e3 ratio and fluorescence e g peak intensity ratios and fluorescence index measurements at different wavelengths 2 4 2 criterion 2 optical parameter reliably differentiates paired source and wastewater samples criterion 2 defines that the parameter must be able to differentiate between paired efom and domnatural with high statistical power the parameter must also measure a change between paired efom and domnatural samples that is relatively large and consistent between systems to be identified as a viable monitoring tool this criterion was evaluated using assessment tools b e assessment tools b and c perform type i and type ii error analyses to confirm that the measured difference between the optical signals of paired efom and domnatural is consistently larger than the uncertainty associated with parameter measurement type i error is falsely concluding that there is a difference between efom and domnatural optical signals when the true responses are equivalent type ii error is failing to detect a shift in an optical signal between efom and domnatural when the compositions are different committing a type ii error may result in underestimating the degree of efom assimilation into a receiving reservoir or influent stream to a potable water reuse treatment train for the latter case this may have further consequences on the efficacy of treatment processes and the quality of product water type i error analysis used a paired t test to determine if the mean values n 3 of paired efom and domnatural samples were statistically different α 0 05 type ii error analysis was performed by determining the required optical parameter shift i e difference in means using operating characteristic curves occs the occs assumed a power of 0 90 β 0 10 type i error rate α of 0 05 and standard deviation for a sample size of n 3 for some optical parameters the standard deviation between replicates varied considerably due to doc concentration and site specific conditions e g spatial and temporal conditions therefore a range of required shifts for each parameter was determined using the observed minimum and maximum standard deviation of replicates importantly for parameters that required multiple measurements such as doc and absorbance normalized parameters e g suva254 the measurement uncertainty was calculated using a propagation of error analysis if the minimum required shift determined from the occs was greater than the observed shifts the parameter was designated non viable since it could not reliably differentiate between efom and domnatural with statistical power si section 3 2 1 provides example calculations for the error analysis evaluations assessment tools d and e define that parameters used for online monitoring applications should measure a relatively large change i e high magnitude in pairs of efom and domnatural samples that is consistent across diverse systems i e low inter system variability these attributes are important because an optical parameter that exhibits a large change in one system but little to no change in another system may not be suitable to monitor diverse systems assessment tool d defines an average relative percent change efom signal minus domnatural signal relative to the domnatural signal greater than 50 as the threshold for identifying optical parameters that exhibited high sensitivity to changes in dom composition assessment tool e evaluates inter system variability and defines an inter system cv less than 50 as the threshold for viability discussion of the magnitude and inter system variability thresholds for identifying viable optical parameters are discussed in the results section 3 3 2 4 3 criterion 3 low susceptibility to inner filter effects criterion 3 identifies fluorescence parameters that are minimally impacted by fluorescence inner filter effects inner filter effects ifes are an optical artifact of fluorescence measurements in which light entering excitation and exiting emission the sample is absorbed by the sample lakowicz 2006 with bench top fluorometers it is common practice to use the measured sample absorbance to correct eems for ifes kothawala et al 2013 kubista et al 1994 murphy et al 2010 however available sensor technology does not have the capability to correct for ifes khamis et al 2018 which is an identified drawback of using fluorescence sensors to monitor water quality in real time henderson et al 2009 hudson et al 2007 to evaluate the susceptibility of intrinsic fluorescence based parameters to ifes these parameters were calculated with and without ife corrections the percent difference of ife corrected and uncorrected parameter values was used to assess the impact of ifes since ifes increase with optical density the required percent correction was plotted as a function of absorbance at 280 nm uva280 which was selected to represent a general optical density while avoiding interferences from oxidized nitrogen species if the ife correction at uva280 of 0 1 cm 1 exceeded 5 then the parameter was considered not viable by introducing a bias that is greater than measurement uncertainty 3 results and discussion the methodology presented in section 2 4 was applied to 11 pairs of wastewater and source water samples to determine which optical parameters meet the described evaluation criteria the parameters that met the performance criteria were critically compared against parameters that are most commonly used to distinguish efom from domnatural 3 1 optical parameter is a surrogate for dom composition criterion 1 a criterion 1 specifies that an optical parameter should measure compositional differences between efom and domnatural independent of concentration changes most commonly applied optical surrogates are extrinsic parameters including fluorescence peak intensities or integrated regional intensities within a pre defined area as discussed in reviews by others carstea et al 2016 henderson et al 2009 hudson et al 2007 several studies have used fluorescence intensities to monitor water quality in real time using in situ sensors hur and cho 2012 khamis et al 2018 puiu et al 2015 ruhala and zarnetske 2017 carstea et al 2010 in fact there are commercial tryptophan sensors that have been advertised as tools to track wastewater effluent predict biological oxygen demand and measure fluorescence in the peak b and t region of an eem extrinsic parameters however do not uniquely differentiate composition and concentration responses in assimilation scenarios as detailed in the si section 3 1 therefore extrinsic parameters were eliminated from further consideration leaving the intrinsic parameters in table 3 this criterion alone identifies the biggest difference between the most commonly used optical parameters for efom and domnatural differentiation and the parameters selected through this methodology table 2 3 2 statistical differentiation of source water from paired wastewater criterion 2 b and c intrinsic parameters were evaluated for both type i false positive and type ii false negative error type i error analysis found that all intrinsic parameters were able to statistically differentiate efom from domnatural for paired samples α 0 05 as shown in tables s 10 these results demonstrate that the optical parameters evaluated would likely have a low false positive error rate if used to distinguish efom from domnatural within watersheds intrinsic parameters were further screened for their statistical power in distinguishing paired efom and domnatural by applying occs to evaluate the risk of type ii error fig 1 plots the measured optical parameter shifts i e the difference between paired wastewater and source water signals for each site overlaid with the range of required shifts determined using occs if the minimum required shift for statistical power overlapped with the measured shift of at least one site the optical parameter was categorized as non viable since it was unable to detect a shift between efom and domnatural for paired samples with a power of at least 0 9 for triplicate measurements nine out of the 19 intrinsic parameters evaluated were unable to detect a shift between efom and domnatural with high statistical power fig 1 which highlights the impact of measurement uncertainty on results interpretation in general fluorescence measurements had high reproducibility whereas absorbance measurements at higher wavelengths 400 nm and doc measurements at lower concentrations 3 mgc l had relatively lower reproducibility to illustrate the cv of triplicate fluorescence index measurements was 1 for all samples n 22 as a result the minimum required shift of 0 062 for fluorescence index determined through occ analysis was relatively low compared to the range of observed differences between paired samples 0 26 0 52 making fluorescence index a viable parameter in contrast suva254 values were found to have a comparatively higher propagated error which resulted in a higher required shift 0 27 l mgc 1 m 1 relative to observed differences in paired samples 1 2 to 0 043 l mgc 1 m 1 making suva254 a non viable parameter all absorbance only parameters except for spectral slope 275 295 nm were found to be non viable due to increased measurement uncertainty at higher wavelengths coupled with the relatively small percent change between paired samples fig 1 on the other hand the parameter shifts of fluorescence only parameters notably fluorescence index freshness index humification index and peak a t far exceed the minimum required shift a notable drawback with utilizing doc normalized parameters for online monitoring is the relatively high doc measurement uncertainty at environmentally relevant concentrations the uncertainty of doc measurements using the wet oxidation method increased with decreased doc concentration and ranged from 0 5 11 mgc l up to 3 7 2 8 mgc l wet oxidation is commonly used for both bench scale and online doc measurements mopper and qian 2000 if doc reproducibility were to exceed 5 which is not uncommon for doc concentrations 1 mgc l korak et al 2014 all doc normalized parameters would likely be non viable after type ii error analysis it is important to note that analysis and interpretation of the occs results depend on the sample size and analytical measurement method increasing the sample size will decrease the required shift needed for statistical power for example a sample size increase from 3 to 6 could make spectral slope 350 400 nm a viable surrogate increasing the sample size may be feasible for measurements that can be collected at high frequency e g online absorbance but less practical for doc normalized parameters as the analysis time for the wet oxidation method is longer ruhala and zarnetske 2017 it is also important to note that parameter screening was conducted using one set of commonly used fluorescence measurement conditions e g pathlength bandpass integration times instruments can be optimized for specific wavelength regions and different instruments sensors have different optical components changes in the instrumental method would warrant re evaluation of the error analysis type ii analysis e g the use of occs has often been overlooked in studies assessing the feasibility of utilizing optical parameters for water quality monitoring results from this section as well as other studies fairweather 1991 legg and nagy 2006 highlight the importance of considering both types of error if only type i error was considered all 19 intrinsic parameters would be considered viable applying a parameter that is susceptible to false negatives could result in the underestimation of wastewater impact on receiving water bodies and a lost opportunity to optimize the operational efficiency of water reuse treatment trains 3 3 evaluation of magnitude and inter system variability criterion 2 d and e fig 2 illustrates the different intrinsic parameter responses across paired efom and domnatural samples for example specific peaks b and t exhibited responses with large relative changes i e high magnitude between paired samples and high variability of those responses between systems as shown by the large distribution in the percent change 75 750 increase on the other hand humification index was found to have a small distribution 10 14 that was fairly consistent between systems to more clearly compare the results illustrated in fig 2 parameters were categorized in fig 3 based on response magnitude and inter system variability each using a 50 threshold the average percent change of most doc normalized parameters e g specific fluorescence peak intensities apart from specific peak a were large in both magnitude and inter system variability indicating that these parameters are more sensitive to site specific conditions studies have observed varied removal efficiencies of fluorescence intensities along different stages of wastewater treatment carstea et al 2016 cohen et al 2014 riopel et al 2014 yu et al 2013 to illustrate yu et al 2013 reported that peak t was removed by 60 40 and 5 after anaerobic anoxic oxic and final clarification treatment respectively the wastewater samples studied herein were collected from wastewater treatment plants that utilized different biological and tertiary treatment processes tables s 1 which might explain the high inter system variability observed for specific fluorescence peak intensities for spectral slope ratio spectral slope 300 600 nm e2 e3 suva254 suva280 and specific peak a the relative change in optical response between efom and domnatural pairs were low in magnitude and highly variable between systems fig 3 and had at least one sample pair that showed a response in the opposite direction indicated by the fig 2 boxplot range crossing zero on the x axis not surprisingly these parameters were identified as non viable in section 3 2 due to their low statistical power fig 1 suva254 has been used to differentiate the bulk characteristics of efom from waters containing primarily domnatural her et al 2003 hu et al 2016 nam et al 2008 efom as compared to domnatural has been shown to exhibit lower suva254 values which has been attributed to lower molecular weight and lower aromatic content weishaar et al 2003 however the high response variability and susceptibility to type ii error of suva254 and suva280 suggests that these commonly used optical metrics may not be able to consistently differentiate efom and domnatural across a range of systems with the exception of spectral slopes 275 295 nm and 350 400 nm only fluorescence based parameters were observed to have low inter system variability this observation not only demonstrates that the measured fluorescence changes between efom and domnatural were relatively independent of site location but also suggests that fluorescence based parameters are selectively measuring dom characteristics that are more ubiquitous in natural or wastewater sources for example the intrinsic fluorescence characteristics of the efom samples collected after activated sludge and trickling filter processes were similar and may indicate that the optical parameters identified herein may be more broadly applicable to other types of biological treatment processes a study by murphy et al 2018 found similar fluorescence characteristics in diverse environmental samples which may indicate the inherent fluorescing moieties of dom are less susceptible to spatial and temporal conditions fluorescence quantum yield ex 370 nm and peak ratios c t and a t were the only parameters that exhibited a high percent change 50 that was consistently measured across systems 50 inter system variability figs 2 and 3 the inter system variability of fluorescence quantum yield was 41 which is near the selected threshold of 50 and comparatively higher than peak ratio c t and a t variability 28 and 14 respectively depending on site specific requirements the 50 threshold selected to bin parameters into categories of low or high magnitude and inter system variability could be adjusted to be more or less stringent in the case of the fluorescence quantum yield lowering the inter system variability requirement to 40 would classify this parameter as having high inter system variability which could eliminate it as an optical surrogate for efom in contrast adjusting the threshold to be less stringent may allow for other parameters to be considered as surrogates for instance spectral slope 275 295 nm freshness index and fluorescence index measured a low but consistent average percent change 27 35 between paired samples with high statistical power fig 2 therefore a percent change between efom and domnatural of 25 could be considered adequate and used to identify additional promising optical surrogates 3 4 susceptibility of fluorescence based parameters to inner filter effects criterion 3 f to identify optical parameters that may not require ife corrections during online measurements fluorescence based metrics were calculated with and without ife corrections the percent difference was plotted as a function of uva280 fig 4 where uva280 is a measure of general sample optical density ife corrections that exceeded 5 at uva280 0 1 cm 1 were considered to have a significant impact on parameter measurement since most cvs of triplicate fluorescence measurements fell well below 5 it can therefore be concluded that ife corrections above 5 would result in decreased reliability of fluorescence based parameters to detect differences in the compositional characteristics of wastewater and source water the sensitivity of fluorescence based parameters to ifes varied considerably fig 4 seven out of the 12 fluorescence based parameters required a correction factor of at least 5 at optical densities as low as 0 03 cm 1 at uva280 e g specific peaks a c and t in contrast the ife corrections for fluorescence quantum yield humification index fluorescence index freshness index and peak a t were 5 at the highest measured absorbance uva280 0 1 cm 1 this finding indicates that these parameters are less prone to ifes and have potential to be applied as optical surrogates without ife corrections when uva280 is less than 0 10 cm 1 however even parameters that exhibit low susceptibility to ifes show a gradual increase in ife correction factors with increased sample optical density uva280 therefore these observations may not hold true at higher optical densities for instance ohno 2002 observed statistically significant deviations between ife corrected and uncorrected data for humification index when uva254 values exceeded 0 10 cm 1 although peak a t humification index and freshness index are measured at wavelengths more affected by ifes ex 350 nm the corrections were 5 this result illustrates that the ratio of fluorescence peak intensities measured at similar excitation wavelengths are less impacted by ifes and more promising for online monitoring than individual peak intensities such as peak b or t doc normalized fluorescence peak intensities along with peak ratios c a and c t were most susceptible to ifes and required up to 20 ife corrections at uva280 0 1 cm 1 doc normalized peak intensities and extrinsic peak intensities will exhibit the same susceptibility to ifes since doc normalization has no impact on ife corrections since peak a and t were more impacted by ifes compared to peak c the peak ratios c a and c t were more susceptible to ifes compared to peak a t therefore the relative contribution of fluorescence in the humic like region compared to the protein like region could be better assessed with sensors using peak a t rather than peak c t while studies have investigated peak c t or peak t c as an optical indicator of farm waste baker 2002 old et al 2012 and sewage baker 2001 impact on watersheds peak a t has primarily been used to characterize the transformation of dom during natural processes coble et al 2014 hansen et al 2016 as discussed fluorescence peak intensities have been widely used as optical surrogates for efom and presented as promising metrics to monitor water quality using sensor technology khamis et al 2018 li et al 2016 ruhala and zarnetske 2017 in order to use fluorescence peak intensities with or without doc normalization or either peak ratio c a or c t for online monitoring results from this study demonstrate that an absorbance sensor would need to be used in tandem with a fluorescence sensor for ife correction in the case of doc normalized parameters three instruments would be required to measure organic carbon fluorescence and absorbance which would not only increase capital and operating costs compared to a standalone sensor but also compound measurement uncertainty 3 5 proposed surrogates to differentiate efom and domnatural after applying assessment tools a f of the proposed methodology table 2 some parameters were found to be more advantageous than others for the differentiation between efom and domnatural a summary of the parameters that met each criterion is provided in table 4 only two parameters fluorescence quantum yield ex 370 nm and peak a t meet all applied methodology criteria peak a t has been used to assess humic like material peak a relative to proteinaceous material peak t in biological processes hansen et al 2016 and photobleaching processes discussed in coble et al 2014 the fluorescence quantum yield measures the fraction of absorbed light that is released through the fluorescence pathway lakowicz 2006 and has been used to characterize dom boyle et al 2009 cawley et al 2015 downing et al 2009 sharpless and blough 2014 and photochemical reactions taking place in surface waters johannessen and miller 2001 mckay et al 2018 mostafa et al 2014 vaughan and blough 1998 bodhipaksha et al 2015 the fluorescence quantum yield measured at excitation wavelength 370 nm fluoresces in a similar eem region as fluorescent whitening agents excitation 350 365 nm emission 400 440 nm a group of compounds used in detergents that are resistant to biodegradation and commonly found in wastewater assaad et al 2014 carlson and shapiro 1981 hartel et al 2007 poiger et al 1996 1999 it may be possible that the fluorescence of these whitening agents contributes to the quantum yield of efom compared to domnatural given the spatial and temporal diversity of sample collection sites it would be expected that the inter system variability of quantum yields be much higher likely above 50 if fluorescent whitening agents were the sole contributor to increased efom fluorescence quantum yields in either case fluorescence quantum yield was identified as promising optical surrogate and has not been investigated as an in situ monitoring strategy 4 conclusions a methodology is proposed to assess optical parameters against objective performance criteria the quantitative screening process was applied to a case study that focused on the differentiation of efom collected from the effluent of wastewater treatment plants operating biological treatment processes i e activated sludge or trickling filters from domnatural using of 11 sets of paired samples application of the methodical approach led to the proposition of two optical surrogates i e fluorescence quantum yield ex 370 nm and peak a t that differ from commonly used optical surrogates for efom e g peak t intensity fluorescence index peak c t ratio the methodology criteria can be used to identify parameters that best represent study specific research questions for example a different set of optical surrogates could be identified if efom samples were collected from wastewater treatment plants that operated more advanced processes e g ozone biofiltration compared to conventional processes e g activated sludge and trickling filters optical parameters were screened based on end member optical signals future work could tailor the defined criteria to investigate the optical behavior of dom for intermediate blending ratios however optical parameters unable to reliably distinguish end members are less likely to perform well in more complex scenarios overall the methodology for optical surrogate selection presented herein provides future studies with a systematic approach to objectively and confidently identify viable optical

18302,absorbance and fluorescence based optical parameters are commonly used as surrogates in engineered systems but there is no systematic approach for selecting robust parameters this study develops a methodology that is applied to a case study of differentiating wastewater effluent organic matter from naturally derived organic matter the methodology defines criteria to identify optical parameters that could detect statistically significant compositional differences in organic matter independent of organic matter concentration and measure fluorescence based parameters with low susceptibility to inner filter effects the criteria were applied to 26 parameters that were measured for 11 pairs of source water and conventionally treated wastewater samples collected from sites with varied spatial and temporal conditions only two parameters apparent fluorescence quantum yield measured at excitation 370 nm and fluorescence peak ratio a t met the criteria across all sites these results demonstrate and encourage an objective and robust process for selecting optical surrogates for organic matter characterization graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluorescence quantum yield absorbance dom efom water reuse 1 introduction the use of optical parameters i e absorbance and fluorescence for the measurement and characterization of dissolved organic matter dom in natural and engineered environments has gained much attention over the past 20 years these techniques are used in part due to their high sensitivity simplicity of use and importantly high frequency of measurement when applied to in situ sensor based technology khamis et al 2018 li et al 2016 ruhala and zarnetske 2017 absorbance spectroscopy measures chromophoric dom cdom which is the optically active fraction of dom that absorbs light absorbance measurements were initially identified as a surrogate for dom concentration i e dissolved organic carbon doc and have developed into surrogates for dom reactivity and composition fluorescence spectroscopy measures the fraction of cdom that emits light i e fluorescent dom fdom only a fraction of dom is fdom and the apparent fluorescence quantum yields for dom are low 1 3 the spectral signatures of cdom and fdom are conventionally collected on bench scale instruments across a wide range of wavelengths 200 nm up to 600 nm although in situ absorbance sensors can measure spectra current in situ fluorescence sensors collect single excitation emission wavelength combinations with broad bandpass resolution downing et al 2012 watras et al 2011 typically fdom and cdom signatures are interpreted using an ever expanding range of optical parameters which extract a quantitative measure of specific spectral characteristics for example both specific uv absorbance suva at 254 nm suva254 and the fluorescence index have been correlated to dom aromaticity mcknight et al 2001 weishaar et al 2003 optical surrogates have been used to characterize dom removal and trace organic contaminant transformation in conventional drinking water treatment anumol et al 2015 bieroza et al 2011 2009 carstea et al 2010 edzwald et al 1985 korak et al 2015 roccaro et al 2009 sanchez et al 2014 2013 advanced oxidation processes gerrity et al 2012 wert et al 2009 and water reuse systems baker 2001 baker et al 2004 hambly et al 2010 henderson et al 2009 korshin et al 2018 murphy et al 2011 given the increased discharge and assimilation of treated wastewater into natural and engineered water systems optical parameters are being increasingly integrated into water reuse systems to monitor the water quality reuse of wastewater for potable consumption can occur when waste discharge is mixed intentionally planned water reuse or unintentionally de facto water reuse with natural source water and then further treated for drinking water use in scenarios where wastewater effluent is blended with a natural source water either de facto or planned the observed mixture of dom is composed of both naturally derived organic matter domnatural and wastewater derived organic matter commonly referred to as effluent organic matter efom as represented by eq 1 1 dom domnatural efom domnatural is present in natural waters and is a mixture of soluble degraded plant animal and microbial derived organic material thurman and malcolm 1981 on the other hand efom is a mixture of dom originating from water supplies domnatural residual soluble microbial products smps produced during biological wastewater treatment and trace levels of organic contaminants michael kordatou et al 2015 tran et al 2015 in terms of mass contribution smps in efom dominate over domnatural on a carbon basis and organic contaminants contribute minimally to the overall mass balance shon et al 2006 wastewater treatment operational parameters such as sludge retention time organic loading rate hydraulic retention time and process temperature alter the efom concentration and physicochemical properties michael kordatou et al 2015 shon et al 2006 in natural and engineered reuse systems the reactivity of dom depends on the contributions of efom and domnatural drewes and fox 2000 hu et al 2016 compositional changes in dom impact the treatment efficiency and product water quality of water treatment plants hu et al 2016 jarusutthirak and amy 2007 efom is broadly viewed as a surrogate for constituents that may decrease treatment performance or have the potential to threaten human and aquatic health a public concern with reusing wastewater for potable use is the potential for undesirable constituents present in efom or formed during treatment of efom e g oxidation or disinfection byproducts to remain after treatment continuously monitoring changes in dom composition and quantifying the contribution of efom would enable tracking of efom assimilation into natural waters that are used by drinking water treatment facilities which would allow for better management of treatment processes impacted by de facto water reuse numerous optical parameters have been developed using absorbance and fluorescence measurements occasionally in conjunction with doc concentration to differentiate efom from domnatural for example the maximum or integrated fluorescence intensities within pre defined excitation and emission regions coble 1996 and components identified in parallel factor analysis parafac modeling have been used as optical surrogates for efom or organic contaminants coexisting with efom baker 2001 baker et al 2014 carstea et al 2010 hur and cho 2012 ishii and boyer 2012 li et al 2014 riopel et al 2014 sgroi et al 2017 wells et al 2017 absorbance based parameters including suva254 spectral slope and others have been used for dom source discrimination as reviewed by li and hur 2017 while some studies have assessed a group of parameters e g peak t suva fluorescence index for one environmental system others have applied one parameter e g peak t to many environmental systems as reviewed by carstea et al 2016 and henderson et al 2009 a common approach and justification for optical parameter selection is to rely on correlations observed in previous studies that have been conducted in a specific experimental context for example peak t has been widely used as a surrogate for efom since marine studies observed protein like dom more specifically amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan to fluoresce in the same region as peak t yamashita and tanoue 2003 however it has been shown that the measured fluorescence of peak t may not be unique to protein like dom due to polyphenols and the fluorescence signature of these amino acids is strongly quenched by other dom moieties maie et al 2007 wang et al 2015 another study by murphy and co workers demonstrated that similar fluorescence moieties appear ubiquitously in diverse ecosystems and fluorescence signatures used to describe genesis i e microbial vs terrestrial can be manipulated in the lab through photoirradiation and yield contradictory interpretations murphy et al 2018 findings like these have added to the ongoing debate of why dom exhibits its characteristic absorbance and fluorescence signatures with hypotheses including a superposition of non interacting molecules and charge transfer complexes mckay et al 2018 schendorf et al 2019 sharpless and blough 2014 wünsch et al 2017 this broader debate questions the reliance on selecting optical parameters based on previous study specific findings compared to selecting parameters based on the objective utility until the fundamentals of dom photophysics are better understood currently there exists no standard approach to justify the selection of optical parameters for data interpretation which has led to a lack of consistency between studies and a segmented body of research in response this study developed a methodology to systematically assess the robustness of optical parameters for the application of differentiating efom from domnatural for this purpose 11 pairs of wastewater effluent and corresponding surface water samples were collected from sites throughout the united states a total of 26 optical parameters shown in tables s 3 and s 4 were evaluated against quantitative performance criteria application of the methodology identified a pair of optical surrogates with the potential to be effective monitoring tools in reuse systems although the application of the methodology is specific to water reuse the framework could be adapted to other scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 water sample collection eleven pairs of secondary or tertiary treated wastewater and their corresponding source water were collected from six sites around the united states three sites were sampled twice and one site was sampled at two different points along the wastewater treatment train all wastewater plants used biological treatment processes i e activated sludge or trickling filters and samples were collected after secondary or tertiary treatment tables s 1 source water herein defined as the water from which the wastewater was originally derived and reported through personal correspondence to be minimally impacted by anthropogenic sources was either collected upstream of the wastewater treatment facility or at the influent of the drinking water treatment facility sites are identified by number codes to preserve their anonymity additional information on the sites can be found in supporting information si section 1 2 2 analytical methods samples were filtered with rinsed 0 45 μm nylon filters vwr pa to remove particulates and microorganisms and stored at 4 c to inhibit further microbial activity baker et al 2014 doc was measured using sievers m5310c total organic carbon analyzer suez co using a uv persulfate wet oxidation organic carbon method bulk water quality analyses including doc alkalinity ph nitrate and nitrite are presented in table 1 absorbance scans were measured in 1 cm quartz cuvettes from 200 to 800 nm in 1 nm increments using a cary 100 bio uv vis spectrophotometer agilent technologies ca and were baseline corrected absorbance data were used to calculate a range of optical parameters tables s 3 and s 4 fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems were collected for excitation wavelengths from 240 to 500 nm in 10 nm increments and for emission wavelengths from 300 to 700 nm in 2 nm increments in triplicate using a fluoromax 4 spectrofluorometer horiba nj following already reported methods mckay et al 2018 the integration time was 0 25 s and a 5 nm bandpass was used for excitation and emission monochromators fluorescence data were corrected following protocols provided in murphy et al 2010 eems were blank subtracted inner filter corrected using the absorbance spectra unless specifically noted and raman normalized using matlab mathworks ma corrected fluorescence data were used to calculate a variety of optical parameters summarized in tables s 3 and s 4 apparent fluorescence quantum yield values were calculated at an excitation wavelength of 370 nm using quinine sulfate in 0 1 n sulfuric acid as a standard following the methods in mckay et al 2018 2 3 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed using graphpad prism 7 software graphpad software ca or minitab software version 17 minitab llc pa the uncertainties of optical parameters are reported as the coefficient of variation cv which is the standard deviation of replicate measurements divided by the mean in all boxplots boxes represent the interquartile range whiskers represent the maximum and minimum and the interior band shows the median value 2 4 performance criteria for optical parameter selection to objectively and quantitatively assess the ability of optical parameters see table s 3 and s 4 to distinguish efom from domnatural this study evaluated each parameter against performance based criteria to determine the most promising optical surrogates table 2 this approach differs from other studies where optical parameters are selected based on previous studies rather than demonstrating reliability to answer study specific questions the criteria define that optical parameters must 1 be able to track compositional differences in organic matter independent of dom concentration 2 reliably differentiate efom from domnatural that is assumed to be minimally impacted by efom and 3 have low susceptibility to sample specific optical artifacts i e inner filter effects which is needed for in situ monitoring applications for the criteria six assessment tools a f were defined table 2 section 3 of the si provides detailed explanations and example calculations for the objective criteria 2 4 1 criterion 1 optical parameter is a surrogate for dom composition criterion 1 defines that the optical parameter should be an intrinsic parameter as opposed to an extrinsic parameter intrinsic parameters are able to measure differences in dom composition independent of concentration whereas extrinsic parameters are impacted by changes in both dom composition and concentration this criterion was prioritized because in dynamic systems such as water treatment systems where carbon concentrations are in continuous flux due to both engineered and natural processes it becomes difficult to interpret if changes in an extrinsic parameter are attributed to changes in dom composition or concentration table 3 lists the intrinsic parameters evaluated in this study with definitions provided in tables s 4 a well known approach to isolate compositional characteristics of dom is to normalize the absorbance or fluorescence peak intensity to the doc concentration producing suva and specific peak intensities respectively another method is to calculate the ratios of multiple absorbance e g e2 e3 ratio and fluorescence e g peak intensity ratios and fluorescence index measurements at different wavelengths 2 4 2 criterion 2 optical parameter reliably differentiates paired source and wastewater samples criterion 2 defines that the parameter must be able to differentiate between paired efom and domnatural with high statistical power the parameter must also measure a change between paired efom and domnatural samples that is relatively large and consistent between systems to be identified as a viable monitoring tool this criterion was evaluated using assessment tools b e assessment tools b and c perform type i and type ii error analyses to confirm that the measured difference between the optical signals of paired efom and domnatural is consistently larger than the uncertainty associated with parameter measurement type i error is falsely concluding that there is a difference between efom and domnatural optical signals when the true responses are equivalent type ii error is failing to detect a shift in an optical signal between efom and domnatural when the compositions are different committing a type ii error may result in underestimating the degree of efom assimilation into a receiving reservoir or influent stream to a potable water reuse treatment train for the latter case this may have further consequences on the efficacy of treatment processes and the quality of product water type i error analysis used a paired t test to determine if the mean values n 3 of paired efom and domnatural samples were statistically different α 0 05 type ii error analysis was performed by determining the required optical parameter shift i e difference in means using operating characteristic curves occs the occs assumed a power of 0 90 β 0 10 type i error rate α of 0 05 and standard deviation for a sample size of n 3 for some optical parameters the standard deviation between replicates varied considerably due to doc concentration and site specific conditions e g spatial and temporal conditions therefore a range of required shifts for each parameter was determined using the observed minimum and maximum standard deviation of replicates importantly for parameters that required multiple measurements such as doc and absorbance normalized parameters e g suva254 the measurement uncertainty was calculated using a propagation of error analysis if the minimum required shift determined from the occs was greater than the observed shifts the parameter was designated non viable since it could not reliably differentiate between efom and domnatural with statistical power si section 3 2 1 provides example calculations for the error analysis evaluations assessment tools d and e define that parameters used for online monitoring applications should measure a relatively large change i e high magnitude in pairs of efom and domnatural samples that is consistent across diverse systems i e low inter system variability these attributes are important because an optical parameter that exhibits a large change in one system but little to no change in another system may not be suitable to monitor diverse systems assessment tool d defines an average relative percent change efom signal minus domnatural signal relative to the domnatural signal greater than 50 as the threshold for identifying optical parameters that exhibited high sensitivity to changes in dom composition assessment tool e evaluates inter system variability and defines an inter system cv less than 50 as the threshold for viability discussion of the magnitude and inter system variability thresholds for identifying viable optical parameters are discussed in the results section 3 3 2 4 3 criterion 3 low susceptibility to inner filter effects criterion 3 identifies fluorescence parameters that are minimally impacted by fluorescence inner filter effects inner filter effects ifes are an optical artifact of fluorescence measurements in which light entering excitation and exiting emission the sample is absorbed by the sample lakowicz 2006 with bench top fluorometers it is common practice to use the measured sample absorbance to correct eems for ifes kothawala et al 2013 kubista et al 1994 murphy et al 2010 however available sensor technology does not have the capability to correct for ifes khamis et al 2018 which is an identified drawback of using fluorescence sensors to monitor water quality in real time henderson et al 2009 hudson et al 2007 to evaluate the susceptibility of intrinsic fluorescence based parameters to ifes these parameters were calculated with and without ife corrections the percent difference of ife corrected and uncorrected parameter values was used to assess the impact of ifes since ifes increase with optical density the required percent correction was plotted as a function of absorbance at 280 nm uva280 which was selected to represent a general optical density while avoiding interferences from oxidized nitrogen species if the ife correction at uva280 of 0 1 cm 1 exceeded 5 then the parameter was considered not viable by introducing a bias that is greater than measurement uncertainty 3 results and discussion the methodology presented in section 2 4 was applied to 11 pairs of wastewater and source water samples to determine which optical parameters meet the described evaluation criteria the parameters that met the performance criteria were critically compared against parameters that are most commonly used to distinguish efom from domnatural 3 1 optical parameter is a surrogate for dom composition criterion 1 a criterion 1 specifies that an optical parameter should measure compositional differences between efom and domnatural independent of concentration changes most commonly applied optical surrogates are extrinsic parameters including fluorescence peak intensities or integrated regional intensities within a pre defined area as discussed in reviews by others carstea et al 2016 henderson et al 2009 hudson et al 2007 several studies have used fluorescence intensities to monitor water quality in real time using in situ sensors hur and cho 2012 khamis et al 2018 puiu et al 2015 ruhala and zarnetske 2017 carstea et al 2010 in fact there are commercial tryptophan sensors that have been advertised as tools to track wastewater effluent predict biological oxygen demand and measure fluorescence in the peak b and t region of an eem extrinsic parameters however do not uniquely differentiate composition and concentration responses in assimilation scenarios as detailed in the si section 3 1 therefore extrinsic parameters were eliminated from further consideration leaving the intrinsic parameters in table 3 this criterion alone identifies the biggest difference between the most commonly used optical parameters for efom and domnatural differentiation and the parameters selected through this methodology table 2 3 2 statistical differentiation of source water from paired wastewater criterion 2 b and c intrinsic parameters were evaluated for both type i false positive and type ii false negative error type i error analysis found that all intrinsic parameters were able to statistically differentiate efom from domnatural for paired samples α 0 05 as shown in tables s 10 these results demonstrate that the optical parameters evaluated would likely have a low false positive error rate if used to distinguish efom from domnatural within watersheds intrinsic parameters were further screened for their statistical power in distinguishing paired efom and domnatural by applying occs to evaluate the risk of type ii error fig 1 plots the measured optical parameter shifts i e the difference between paired wastewater and source water signals for each site overlaid with the range of required shifts determined using occs if the minimum required shift for statistical power overlapped with the measured shift of at least one site the optical parameter was categorized as non viable since it was unable to detect a shift between efom and domnatural for paired samples with a power of at least 0 9 for triplicate measurements nine out of the 19 intrinsic parameters evaluated were unable to detect a shift between efom and domnatural with high statistical power fig 1 which highlights the impact of measurement uncertainty on results interpretation in general fluorescence measurements had high reproducibility whereas absorbance measurements at higher wavelengths 400 nm and doc measurements at lower concentrations 3 mgc l had relatively lower reproducibility to illustrate the cv of triplicate fluorescence index measurements was 1 for all samples n 22 as a result the minimum required shift of 0 062 for fluorescence index determined through occ analysis was relatively low compared to the range of observed differences between paired samples 0 26 0 52 making fluorescence index a viable parameter in contrast suva254 values were found to have a comparatively higher propagated error which resulted in a higher required shift 0 27 l mgc 1 m 1 relative to observed differences in paired samples 1 2 to 0 043 l mgc 1 m 1 making suva254 a non viable parameter all absorbance only parameters except for spectral slope 275 295 nm were found to be non viable due to increased measurement uncertainty at higher wavelengths coupled with the relatively small percent change between paired samples fig 1 on the other hand the parameter shifts of fluorescence only parameters notably fluorescence index freshness index humification index and peak a t far exceed the minimum required shift a notable drawback with utilizing doc normalized parameters for online monitoring is the relatively high doc measurement uncertainty at environmentally relevant concentrations the uncertainty of doc measurements using the wet oxidation method increased with decreased doc concentration and ranged from 0 5 11 mgc l up to 3 7 2 8 mgc l wet oxidation is commonly used for both bench scale and online doc measurements mopper and qian 2000 if doc reproducibility were to exceed 5 which is not uncommon for doc concentrations 1 mgc l korak et al 2014 all doc normalized parameters would likely be non viable after type ii error analysis it is important to note that analysis and interpretation of the occs results depend on the sample size and analytical measurement method increasing the sample size will decrease the required shift needed for statistical power for example a sample size increase from 3 to 6 could make spectral slope 350 400 nm a viable surrogate increasing the sample size may be feasible for measurements that can be collected at high frequency e g online absorbance but less practical for doc normalized parameters as the analysis time for the wet oxidation method is longer ruhala and zarnetske 2017 it is also important to note that parameter screening was conducted using one set of commonly used fluorescence measurement conditions e g pathlength bandpass integration times instruments can be optimized for specific wavelength regions and different instruments sensors have different optical components changes in the instrumental method would warrant re evaluation of the error analysis type ii analysis e g the use of occs has often been overlooked in studies assessing the feasibility of utilizing optical parameters for water quality monitoring results from this section as well as other studies fairweather 1991 legg and nagy 2006 highlight the importance of considering both types of error if only type i error was considered all 19 intrinsic parameters would be considered viable applying a parameter that is susceptible to false negatives could result in the underestimation of wastewater impact on receiving water bodies and a lost opportunity to optimize the operational efficiency of water reuse treatment trains 3 3 evaluation of magnitude and inter system variability criterion 2 d and e fig 2 illustrates the different intrinsic parameter responses across paired efom and domnatural samples for example specific peaks b and t exhibited responses with large relative changes i e high magnitude between paired samples and high variability of those responses between systems as shown by the large distribution in the percent change 75 750 increase on the other hand humification index was found to have a small distribution 10 14 that was fairly consistent between systems to more clearly compare the results illustrated in fig 2 parameters were categorized in fig 3 based on response magnitude and inter system variability each using a 50 threshold the average percent change of most doc normalized parameters e g specific fluorescence peak intensities apart from specific peak a were large in both magnitude and inter system variability indicating that these parameters are more sensitive to site specific conditions studies have observed varied removal efficiencies of fluorescence intensities along different stages of wastewater treatment carstea et al 2016 cohen et al 2014 riopel et al 2014 yu et al 2013 to illustrate yu et al 2013 reported that peak t was removed by 60 40 and 5 after anaerobic anoxic oxic and final clarification treatment respectively the wastewater samples studied herein were collected from wastewater treatment plants that utilized different biological and tertiary treatment processes tables s 1 which might explain the high inter system variability observed for specific fluorescence peak intensities for spectral slope ratio spectral slope 300 600 nm e2 e3 suva254 suva280 and specific peak a the relative change in optical response between efom and domnatural pairs were low in magnitude and highly variable between systems fig 3 and had at least one sample pair that showed a response in the opposite direction indicated by the fig 2 boxplot range crossing zero on the x axis not surprisingly these parameters were identified as non viable in section 3 2 due to their low statistical power fig 1 suva254 has been used to differentiate the bulk characteristics of efom from waters containing primarily domnatural her et al 2003 hu et al 2016 nam et al 2008 efom as compared to domnatural has been shown to exhibit lower suva254 values which has been attributed to lower molecular weight and lower aromatic content weishaar et al 2003 however the high response variability and susceptibility to type ii error of suva254 and suva280 suggests that these commonly used optical metrics may not be able to consistently differentiate efom and domnatural across a range of systems with the exception of spectral slopes 275 295 nm and 350 400 nm only fluorescence based parameters were observed to have low inter system variability this observation not only demonstrates that the measured fluorescence changes between efom and domnatural were relatively independent of site location but also suggests that fluorescence based parameters are selectively measuring dom characteristics that are more ubiquitous in natural or wastewater sources for example the intrinsic fluorescence characteristics of the efom samples collected after activated sludge and trickling filter processes were similar and may indicate that the optical parameters identified herein may be more broadly applicable to other types of biological treatment processes a study by murphy et al 2018 found similar fluorescence characteristics in diverse environmental samples which may indicate the inherent fluorescing moieties of dom are less susceptible to spatial and temporal conditions fluorescence quantum yield ex 370 nm and peak ratios c t and a t were the only parameters that exhibited a high percent change 50 that was consistently measured across systems 50 inter system variability figs 2 and 3 the inter system variability of fluorescence quantum yield was 41 which is near the selected threshold of 50 and comparatively higher than peak ratio c t and a t variability 28 and 14 respectively depending on site specific requirements the 50 threshold selected to bin parameters into categories of low or high magnitude and inter system variability could be adjusted to be more or less stringent in the case of the fluorescence quantum yield lowering the inter system variability requirement to 40 would classify this parameter as having high inter system variability which could eliminate it as an optical surrogate for efom in contrast adjusting the threshold to be less stringent may allow for other parameters to be considered as surrogates for instance spectral slope 275 295 nm freshness index and fluorescence index measured a low but consistent average percent change 27 35 between paired samples with high statistical power fig 2 therefore a percent change between efom and domnatural of 25 could be considered adequate and used to identify additional promising optical surrogates 3 4 susceptibility of fluorescence based parameters to inner filter effects criterion 3 f to identify optical parameters that may not require ife corrections during online measurements fluorescence based metrics were calculated with and without ife corrections the percent difference was plotted as a function of uva280 fig 4 where uva280 is a measure of general sample optical density ife corrections that exceeded 5 at uva280 0 1 cm 1 were considered to have a significant impact on parameter measurement since most cvs of triplicate fluorescence measurements fell well below 5 it can therefore be concluded that ife corrections above 5 would result in decreased reliability of fluorescence based parameters to detect differences in the compositional characteristics of wastewater and source water the sensitivity of fluorescence based parameters to ifes varied considerably fig 4 seven out of the 12 fluorescence based parameters required a correction factor of at least 5 at optical densities as low as 0 03 cm 1 at uva280 e g specific peaks a c and t in contrast the ife corrections for fluorescence quantum yield humification index fluorescence index freshness index and peak a t were 5 at the highest measured absorbance uva280 0 1 cm 1 this finding indicates that these parameters are less prone to ifes and have potential to be applied as optical surrogates without ife corrections when uva280 is less than 0 10 cm 1 however even parameters that exhibit low susceptibility to ifes show a gradual increase in ife correction factors with increased sample optical density uva280 therefore these observations may not hold true at higher optical densities for instance ohno 2002 observed statistically significant deviations between ife corrected and uncorrected data for humification index when uva254 values exceeded 0 10 cm 1 although peak a t humification index and freshness index are measured at wavelengths more affected by ifes ex 350 nm the corrections were 5 this result illustrates that the ratio of fluorescence peak intensities measured at similar excitation wavelengths are less impacted by ifes and more promising for online monitoring than individual peak intensities such as peak b or t doc normalized fluorescence peak intensities along with peak ratios c a and c t were most susceptible to ifes and required up to 20 ife corrections at uva280 0 1 cm 1 doc normalized peak intensities and extrinsic peak intensities will exhibit the same susceptibility to ifes since doc normalization has no impact on ife corrections since peak a and t were more impacted by ifes compared to peak c the peak ratios c a and c t were more susceptible to ifes compared to peak a t therefore the relative contribution of fluorescence in the humic like region compared to the protein like region could be better assessed with sensors using peak a t rather than peak c t while studies have investigated peak c t or peak t c as an optical indicator of farm waste baker 2002 old et al 2012 and sewage baker 2001 impact on watersheds peak a t has primarily been used to characterize the transformation of dom during natural processes coble et al 2014 hansen et al 2016 as discussed fluorescence peak intensities have been widely used as optical surrogates for efom and presented as promising metrics to monitor water quality using sensor technology khamis et al 2018 li et al 2016 ruhala and zarnetske 2017 in order to use fluorescence peak intensities with or without doc normalization or either peak ratio c a or c t for online monitoring results from this study demonstrate that an absorbance sensor would need to be used in tandem with a fluorescence sensor for ife correction in the case of doc normalized parameters three instruments would be required to measure organic carbon fluorescence and absorbance which would not only increase capital and operating costs compared to a standalone sensor but also compound measurement uncertainty 3 5 proposed surrogates to differentiate efom and domnatural after applying assessment tools a f of the proposed methodology table 2 some parameters were found to be more advantageous than others for the differentiation between efom and domnatural a summary of the parameters that met each criterion is provided in table 4 only two parameters fluorescence quantum yield ex 370 nm and peak a t meet all applied methodology criteria peak a t has been used to assess humic like material peak a relative to proteinaceous material peak t in biological processes hansen et al 2016 and photobleaching processes discussed in coble et al 2014 the fluorescence quantum yield measures the fraction of absorbed light that is released through the fluorescence pathway lakowicz 2006 and has been used to characterize dom boyle et al 2009 cawley et al 2015 downing et al 2009 sharpless and blough 2014 and photochemical reactions taking place in surface waters johannessen and miller 2001 mckay et al 2018 mostafa et al 2014 vaughan and blough 1998 bodhipaksha et al 2015 the fluorescence quantum yield measured at excitation wavelength 370 nm fluoresces in a similar eem region as fluorescent whitening agents excitation 350 365 nm emission 400 440 nm a group of compounds used in detergents that are resistant to biodegradation and commonly found in wastewater assaad et al 2014 carlson and shapiro 1981 hartel et al 2007 poiger et al 1996 1999 it may be possible that the fluorescence of these whitening agents contributes to the quantum yield of efom compared to domnatural given the spatial and temporal diversity of sample collection sites it would be expected that the inter system variability of quantum yields be much higher likely above 50 if fluorescent whitening agents were the sole contributor to increased efom fluorescence quantum yields in either case fluorescence quantum yield was identified as promising optical surrogate and has not been investigated as an in situ monitoring strategy 4 conclusions a methodology is proposed to assess optical parameters against objective performance criteria the quantitative screening process was applied to a case study that focused on the differentiation of efom collected from the effluent of wastewater treatment plants operating biological treatment processes i e activated sludge or trickling filters from domnatural using of 11 sets of paired samples application of the methodical approach led to the proposition of two optical surrogates i e fluorescence quantum yield ex 370 nm and peak a t that differ from commonly used optical surrogates for efom e g peak t intensity fluorescence index peak c t ratio the methodology criteria can be used to identify parameters that best represent study specific research questions for example a different set of optical surrogates could be identified if efom samples were collected from wastewater treatment plants that operated more advanced processes e g ozone biofiltration compared to conventional processes e g activated sludge and trickling filters optical parameters were screened based on end member optical signals future work could tailor the defined criteria to investigate the optical behavior of dom for intermediate blending ratios however optical parameters unable to reliably distinguish end members are less likely to perform well in more complex scenarios overall the methodology for optical surrogate selection presented herein provides future studies with a systematic approach to objectively and confidently identify viable optical

18303,in this study we systematically investigated the bacterial community dynamics in highly selective strong hydraulic selection pressure and high organic loading rate bioreactors with acetate as the sole carbon source 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing and metagenomic sequencing results showed that phenolics degrading bacteria pdb which were mainly acinetobacter species in the newly formed aerobic granules could account for 70 of the total bacteria near full length 16s rrna gene sequences obtained by cloning suggest that the pdb are potentially novel species because they are distantly related to known acinetobacter species however these pdb only temporarily appeared in the early stage of the granule formation and their abundance quickly decreased along the reactor operation to retain these pdb we demonstrated that the newly formed aerobic granules could accelerate biofilm formation in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs and the biofilm carriers showed gradually increased phenol degradation performance in the mbbrs while the bacterial community in biofilm significantly changed during the operation process of the mbbrs and the community structure became more complicated than that in the aerobic granules collectively this study provides new insights into the microbial ecology of sludge granulation and biofilm formation process in the wastewater treatment systems for remediating phenolic matters graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological wastewater treatment phenolics degrading bacteria aerobic granular sludge moving bed biofilm reactor metagenomics 1 introduction phenolics including phenol and its derivatives are common pollutants in industrial wastewater and are toxic to humans animals and microorganisms busca et al 2008 gupta et al 2004 biological degradation is considered as an efficient and cost effective approach to remove phenolic compounds from wastewater sarfaraz et al 2004 yamaga et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 however due to the toxicity of phenolic substances the startup period for bioreactors is usually long and reactor performance could be disturbed by concentration fluctuations oberoi and philip 2017 ramos et al 2017 therefore development of more efficient and stable biological phenolic wastewater treatment technologies is required as one of the most promising wastewater treatment technologies aerobic granular sludge ags has been intensively studied in the past two decades morales et al 2013 morgenroth et al 1997 pronk et al 2015 verawaty et al 2012 winkler et al 2015 jiang et al 2002 documented the application of ags to degrade toxic substrates which took approximately three months to acclimate municipal activated sludge using phenol and develop phenol degrading granules the long start up issue was later resolved by using acetate to cultivate ags and then introducing phenol as the co substrate tay et al 2005a the start up period was shortened to two weeks with acetate and phenol degradation reached stable within a week besides similar methods have also been applied to treating other refractory compounds such as 2 4 6 tri chlorophenol carucci et al 2008 4 chlorophenol carucci et al 2009 and p nitrophenol yarlagadda et al 2012 investigations based on microscopy and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that bacterial community changed before and after acclimation tay et al 2005b however to the best of our knowledge no study reported the loss of phenol degrading capacity along the reactor operation and the mechanisms and associated microbial community shift were also not comprehensively characterized such information is crucial for us to understand the granulation process and may lead to developing novel solutions for refractory compound degradation in addition to the regular ags a fast granulation strategy was recently proposed to cultivate aerobic granules under extreme selection pressures liu and tay 2015 zhang et al 2013 although the granulation process of aerobic granules has been well characterized the microbial mechanisms behind aerobic granulation and long term stability of granules remain unclear due to lack of knowledge of microbial community structures and functions while recent studies observed that specific taxa such as rhodocyclaceae xanthomonadaceae comamonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae adav et al 2010 lv et al 2014 xia et al 2018 are potentially important for the granulation process their functions are elusive which hinders our understanding of the granulation mechanism and the application of ags technology besides ags moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is another promising biofilm based system that has been applied to treat wastewater bassin et al 2012 gilbert et al 2014 including phenolic wastewater li et al 2011 while the mbbr system has many advantages biofilm development on the surface of carrier materials could be very slow due to the presence of toxic matter or the absence of nutrients in wastewater bassin et al 2012 lee et al 2006 to overcome this issue it is necessary to develop novel approaches to accelerate biofilm formation and development on the carrier surface of mbbrs in this study we operated several sequencing batch reactors sbrs under strong hydraulic selection pressure hsp and high organic loading rate olr using acetate as the sole carbon source sludge granulation was achieved very quickly meanwhile a high abundance of phenolics degrading bacteria pdb appeared in the initial stage of the granulation process but disappeared along the reactor operation the microbial community dynamics during the acclimation process were systematically investigated using both high throughput sequencing and sanger sequencing based on the findings we developed a novel approach to rapidly startup mbbrs for efficient phenol degradation with the aid of newly formed aerobic granules 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of sbrs four sbrs r1 r2 r3 and r4 were operated to cultivate aerobic granules under strong hsp air velocity 2 4 cm s 2 min of settling after 111 min of aeration and high olr 6 g l d r1 r2 and r3 were used to assess the effects of organic loading reactor r1 vs r2 and seed sludge source r2 vs r3 on the process performance and r4 was used to investigate the bacterial community difference between the inner and outer granule layers the height and diameter of each reactor was 100 cm and 5 cm respectively the seeding sludge of r1 was taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant w1 in nanjing china to repeat the sludge granulation process and phenol degrading performance r2 and r3 were started up with seeding sludge taken from w1 and another municipal wastewater treatment plant w2 in nanjing respectively to investigate the bacterial community in the inner and outer granule layers another reactor r4 was started with seeding sludge taken from w1 and operated with same operational parameters as r2 acetate was used as the sole carbon source for the four reactors nitrogen and phosphorus were supplied by nh4cl and kh2po4 respectively and their specific concentrations were shown in table s1 other nutrients adapted from lochmatter et al 2013 including 89 mg l 1 of mgso4 7h2o 27 mg l 1 of cacl2 2h2o 24 mg l 1 of feso4 7h2o 34 μg l 1 of znso4 7h2o 250 μg l 1 of mncl2 4h2o 6 μg l 1 of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 8 μg l 1 of cuso4 5h2o and 8 μg l 1 of cocl2 6h2o were also added to the influent the detailed operational parameters of the reactors are summarized in table s1 sludge samples were taken from the reactors periodically for dna extraction one sludge sample taken from r1 on day 8 was sorted using a series of metal sieves and the separated granules were collected for dna extraction while r2 and r3 were operated for 15 days the continuous operation of r1 was extended to 60 days to monitor long term performance 2 2 separation of inner and outer granule layers after reactor r4 was started up sludge samples were collected from the bioreactor periodically the inner core and outer layer of the granules taken on day 5 8 and 14 were carefully separated using a pair of sterile tweezers we carefully peeled off sludge from the surface of each granule until its diameter was reduced to approximately 2 3 of the original diameter to minimize operational errors the inner cores and outer layers of five granules taken on each day were respectively combined and used for dna extraction 2 3 batch experiment batch experiments were performed to examine the phenol degrading performance of the aerobic granules taken from the sbrs at different stages control experiments were conducted with municipal activated sludge the sludge concentration of the batch experiment was 100 mg l of suspended solids ss and the initial concentrations of phenol were 100 500 and 1000 mg l the water samples were collected at different times 0 0 5 2 6 10 24 48 72 and 96 h for phenol concentration analysis 2 4 moving bed biofilm reactor setup and operation in this study we found that the newly formed aerobic granules could accelerate biofilm formation on the biofilm carriers therefore three mbbrs mr1 mr2 and mr3 filled with kaldnes k3 carriers were operated to evaluate the performance of ags as seed sludge for biofilm development under different phenol concentrations mr1 and mr2 compared to municipal sludge as the seed mr3 each cylindrical mbbr has an effective working volume of 4l and the diameter and height are 16 cm and 20 cm respectively the influent was pumped into the reactor through the bottom and the effluent was discharged through the overflow weir at the top of each reactor for mr1 and mr2 the plastic biofilm carriers were first put into the above mentioned sbr r2 on the second day after startup and two days later the carriers were transferred into mr1 and mr2 for mr3 the plastic biofilm carriers were put into a regular activated sludge taken from w1 reactor and kept for two days then transferred into mr3 the detailed operational parameters of the mbbrs are shown in table s2 phenol was used as the sole carbon source for the three mbbrs and other nutrients were adapted from a previous study delatolla et al

an applied biosystems 3730xl sequencer carlsbad ca usa to obtain near full length 16s rrna gene sequences 2 8 sequencing data analysis the raw 16s rrna gene sequencing data generated by miseq platform were processed with trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 software to remove low quality reads the forward and reverse reads were merged using the make contigs command of mothur schloss et al 2009 after that the sequence data were rarefied at 26180 sequences per sample then the sequences were incorporated into qiime caporaso et al 2010 for operational taxonomic unit otu clustering 97 identity and otus with fewer than three sequences were removed the representative sequence of each otu was assigned taxonomy using the rdp classifier embedded in qiime with greengenes database mcdonald et al 2012 the sequences obtained from the clone library were compared with the sequences in the ncbi nucleotide database for taxonomy annotation using the blastn program a neighbour joining phylogenetic tree containing the 16s rrna gene sequences of known acinetobacter species and the near full length acinetobacter 16s rrna gene sequences obtained in this study and their top hits in ncbi nucleotide database was constructed using mega kumar et al 2016 the metagenomic sequencing reads were quality filtered using trimmomatic bolger et al 2014 then the reads were assembled using idba u peng et al 2012 with the following parameters pre correction min contig 1000 mink 40 after that the reads of each sample were mapped to the assembled contigs with bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 a depth file was generated based on the mapping results and used for genome binning with metabat kang et al 2015 the quality of the recovered genomes was assessed by checkm parks et al 2015 genome taxonomy was

performance under high olr and strong hsp three sbrs were operated under highly selective conditions i e high olr 6 12 g cod l d and strong hsp 2 min of settling after 111 min of aeration and with acetate as the substrate as a consequence aerobic granules formed rapidly in all three reactors regardless of the source of seeding sludge fig s1 the average size of granules in r1 continued to increase until reaching approximately 900 μm after 20 days and remained nearly constant during the rest period of operations fig s2a concurrent with granule formation the ss concentration in the reactors decreased significantly at the beginning of the reactor startup due to the strong hsp and gradually increased to 4500 5000 mg l in approximately 13 days fig s2b during this process the svi5 decreased from 160 to 50 60 ml g fig s2c suggesting the significant enhancement of the sludge settling interestingly batch experiments revealed high phenol degradation capacity of newly formed granules that were taken from the three reactors at day 2 at initial phenol concentrations of 100 or 500 mg l complete degradation was observed within 48 and 96 h respectively fig 1a and b a maximum degradation rate of 4 84 g cod g ss d was observed between 48 h and 72 h 1000 mg l phenol severely inhibited degradation as the phenol concentration only decreased by 10 after 100 h fig 1c these observations were supported by cod measurements fig s3 besides phenol 2 4 dichlorophenol another toxic and recalcitrant xenobiotic compound commonly present in wastewater can also be effectively degraded by newly formed ags fig s4 on the contrary older granules that were taken from the three reactors on day 15 exhibited decreasing phenol degradation capability with 100 mg l phenol concentration the removal efficiency was less than 30 within 96 h fig 1d the degradation was negligible at higher concentrations of 500 mg l and 1000 mg l fig 1e and f cod measurements agreed with these observations fig s3 d e and f the above results indicate that microorganisms capable of degrading phenolics were present in newly formed granules but absent in matured granules to illustrate the microbial community dynamics during the development of aerobic granules high throughput sequencing was applied to analyze the sludge samples taken from different stages during reactor operation 3 2 microbial community dynamics under the highly selective conditions 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing revealed a clear bacterial community shift in r1 according to alpha diversity fig 2 a and beta diversity fig 2b the bacterial community was almost unchanged in the first 8 h after reactor startup and was similar to that of the seeding sludge drastic community shift began at the 14th hour and both the species richness and evenness decreased significantly the samples taken at different time were clearly clustered into four different groups fig 2b instead of betaproteobacteria which was most abundant in the seeding sludge gammaproteobacteria dominated the sludge bacterial community and accounted for 66 70 of the total 16s rrna gene reads fig 2c among the 1537 otus obtained from the sequencing results of the sludge samples otus affiliated with acinetobacter accounted for more than 70 of the total bacteria fig 2d however starting from day 5 betaproteobacteria otus zoogloea increased gradually and made up approximate 50 of total 16s rrna gene reads in day 8 samples its abundance then increased to nearly 80 in the samples taken on and after day 14 the abundance of acinetobacter declined concurrently and accounted for 10 of reads in the latter samples similar results were observed in the bacterial communities of the other two sbrs r2 and r3 fig s5 in all three reactors acinetobacter was the dominant genus at the initial stage of granule formation and was later replaced by zoogloea and other bacterial species this suggests that the community shift is a reproducible process under such conditions the appearance of acinetobacter coincided with the phenol degradation performance of the activated sludge and confirmed the successful enrichment of pdb from activated sludge with acetate in addition to the overall bacterial community in the ags we also analyzed the bacterial populations in the size separated granules taken from r1 on day 8 fig 2 as shown in fig 2c and d the relative abundance of acinetobacter in the smallest granules 0 22 mm accounted for approximately 40 of the total bacteria which was much higher than those in the larger granules accordingly as shown in fig 2b the smallest granules 0 22 mm were grouped with younger granules taken at day 5 and larger granules were grouped with samples taken after day 8 to further investigate the bacterial community in the inner and outer granule layers and elucidate the granule maturation process another reactor r4 was started with seeding sludge taken from w1 and operated with same operational parameters as r2 we separated the inner core and outer shell of granules taken on day 5 8 and 14 fig s6a and analyzed the bacterial community by high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene as shown in fig s6b the higher abundance of acinetobacter was present in the inner layer of the granules fig s6b whereas zoogloea were more abundant in the outer shell to obtain full length 16s rrna gene sequences of the dominant populations and provide higher resolution to their phylogenetic novelty cloning and sequencing were performed with samples taken on days 5 and 60 from r1 nine acinetobacter 16s rrna gene sequences that were near full length were obtained and used to construct a phylogenic tree fig 3 the nine sequences formed two clusters one cluster contained four sequences and their average identity to acinetobacter johnsonii was 99 2 the sequences in the other cluster were relatively distant from cultured species and their average identity to the nearest cultured species acinetobacter junii was 96 8 this suggests that novel acinetobacter species might be present in the aerobic sludge although the number of sequences obtained from the clone library was limited the results fig s7 still demonstrated that high abundance of acinetobacter was present in the early stage while zoogloea became the dominant genera later which was consistent with results of the high throughput sequencing as previous studies have reported acinetobacter species degrading phenol chlorophenol and other aromatics kim and hao 1999 yamaga et al 2010 the high phenol degradation capability of the newly formed granules could be attributed to the acinetobacter species by analyzing more than 48g bp metagenomic sequencing data we obtained nine genome bins affiliated with acinetobacter table s3 this suggested that diverse acinetobacter species were present in the granules and coincided with the 16s rrna gene sequencing results although many genes related to the degradation of aromatics were observed in these bins fig s8 the completeness of these genome bins is not satisfactory 10 3 60 7 this might be caused by the highly similar sequences of these acinetobacter species micro diversity which significantly hampers genome assembly and segregation albertsen et al 2013 nelson et al 2016 genome mapping results fig s9 showed that a large proportion 17 4 34 3 of reads in samples taken in the early days days 1 and 5 could be mapped to acinetobacter genomes and few read were mapped to the zoogloea genome however starting from day 8 more reads were mapped to the zoogloea genome than the acinetobacter genomes this confirmed the 16s rrna gene sequencing results and suggested that significant bacterial community shift occurred during the aerobic granule formation process moreover fig s10 showed that plenty of reads were mapped to the genome of acinetobacter johnsonii similarly several sequences from the clone library are also closely related to acinetobacter johnsonii fig 3 this indicated that one or more species closely related to acinetobacter johnsonii might be present in the aerobic granules 3 3 retaining the pdb by biofilm formation it was found that the pdb acinetobacter only temporarily appeared in the granular formation process our efforts to retain a high abundance of acinetobacter in the sbr by adjusting the operational parameters including the olr and aeration intensity were not successful data not shown in order to retain the acinetobacter for phenol degradation plastic biofilm carriers were placed into the sbr r2 to develop biofilm on the second day after startup as expected visible biofilm was quickly formed on the carriers in two days fig 4c and d 16s rrna gene sequencing showed the relative abundance of acinetobacter in the formed biofilm on day 2 was 19 0 fig s11 suggesting the successful attachment of the acinetobacter on carriers the carriers with biofilm were then transferred into mbbr reactors 100 mg l phenol in influent and high phenol degradation efficiency approximately 66 was observed immediately after reactor startup fig 5 a the degradation efficiency gradually increased to 95 after day 50 for high phenol concentration 500 mg l the degradation efficiency reached 95 in 50 days fig 5b for comparison the same carriers were also placed in regular municipal activated sludge for two days but few biofilms were attached fig 5a and b when the carriers were transferred to a mbbr system the phenol degradation efficiency was very low 10 during the entire 60 day operating period fig 5c these results suggested that the biofilm formation with the aid of newly formed aerobic granules could not only accelerate biofilm formation on the carriers but also facilitate the startup of the mbbr system for phenol degradation along the operation of the mbbrs the bacterial community dynamics in the biofilms changed significantly the analysis results of mr1 and mr2 mr3 was not investigated due to the failure of biofilm development fig 4a and b showed that the microbial community structures in the mbbr samples are more complicated than that in the enriched granular sludge and over 40 of the 16s rrna gene sequences could not be assigned to known genera otus affiliated with acinetobacter accounted for about 19 0 of the total bacteria on day 2 samples taken from the mbbrs but the relative abundance of acinetobacter significantly decreased along the mbbr operation fig s11 despite this the phenol degradation performance gradually increased 4 discussion traditionally for refractory organic wastewater treatment the bacterial community is usually enriched or acclimatized with a gradually increased loading of the corresponding refractory organics adav et al 2007b majumder and gupta 2003 which usually lead to a relatively long startup period previous study showed that the start up period could be shortened by using acetate to cultivate aerobic granules tay et al 2005a in this study we confirmed that during the aerobic granule formation process under strong hsp and high olr a high abundance of pdb mainly acinetobacter can be rapidly enriched from regular municipal activated sludge with acetate as the sole carbon source while aerobic granule formation by combining strong hsp with high olr has been reported recently liu and tay 2015 we systematically revealed that the bacteria community changed significantly during the fast granule formation process and featured a decrease in microbial diversity this is distinct from the bacteria community in typical aerobic granule sludge which harbors diverse bacterial population including rhodocyclaceae xanthomonadaceae comamonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae xia et al 2018 the low bacterial richness was presumably due to the less complex substrates acetate as the sole carbon source high olr and strong hsp the olr might play a critical role in selecting the dominant bacteria population as the high olr in this study favored acinetobacter but a previous study gonzalez gil and holliger 2011 enriched thiothrix in ags with acetate under low olr 1 8 g cod l d novel acinetobacter species might be present in the reactors of this study according to the 16s rrna gene and metagenomic analysis however due to the limitations of shot gun metagenomic sequencing and the micro diversity issue albertsen et al 2013 nelson et al 2016 the complete genomes of these species were not successfully obtained future efforts should be made to obtain more complete genomes of these species and explore the functional traits by means of pure culture isolation and more advanced sequencing and bioinformatic approaches acinetobacter has been observed in aerobic granules by previous studies adav et al 2007a jemaat et al 2014 lv et al 2014 even as the sole species forming aerobic granules adav and lee 2008 in this study under highly selective conditions most bacteria were washed out and only a few bacterial species were retained to form granules the enrichment of acinetobacter confirmed their significant roles in the process of aerobic granule formation this was probably due to their capacity of producing extracellular polymeric substances eps and serving as nucleus of the granules kang and park 2010 pirog et al 2003 however we found that acinetobacter only temporally appeared in the initial stage of the granules analysis of different sized granules showed that acinetobacter were only abundant in the small and young granules 0 22 μm this is probably due to the fact that other bacteria such as zoogloea and hydrogenophaga could adhere to the surface of nucleus formed by acinetobacter and proliferate under high olr conditions after the acinetobacter dominated nucleus was covered by other bacterial species their growth could be inhibited due to limited access of oxygen as most acinetobacter species are strictly aerobic anandham et al 2010 luna and aruj 2007 biofilm formation is a key process for the startup and stable operation of the mbbr and other biofilm reactors nicolella et al 2000 zhu et al 2015 usually for industrial wastewater treatment a relatively long startup period is needed to acclimate the biofilm by increasing the concentration of the refractory organic matter gradually zhou et al 2018 in this study we accelerated the biofilm formation with the aid of newly formed aerobic granules which harbor a high abundance of acinetobacter species in this genus could produce eps and have strong self aggregation ability and adhesion capability to form biofilm and attach to the carrier surface pirog et al 2002 yadav et al 2012 although acinetobacter species could be successfully attached to the carriers the bacterial community in the biofilm shifted significantly along mbbr operation process and the relative abundance of acinetobacter decreased after the startup of mbbrs fig s11 this indicates that some other pdb such as sphingobium microbacterium etc might proliferate in the biofilm in addition the operational conditions especially oxygen concentration and loading rate in the mbbr and the sbr systems are quite different probably some bacteria that did not involve in phenol degradation in sbrs may contribute to do so in the mbbrs due to having different metabolic pathways therefore future studies are needed to reveal the mechanism of the bacterial community shift in the biofilm of the mbbr systems and investigate the phenol degradation ability of acinetobacter and other bacterial species in wastewater treatment bioreactors from an engineering application point of view the pdb quickly enriched from municipal activated sludge under highly selective conditions could be used for bioaugmentation which is an effective technology for the removal of phenols from wastewater poi et al 2017 in addition the rapid biofilm formation method harnessing the adhesion ability of the newly formed granules proposed in this study could be used for accelerating the startup of biofilm reactor for treating phenol and other phenolic compounds which could be more rapid than the traditional startup methods zhou et al 2018 5 conclusion in this study based on the previous reports on the enrichment of pdb with acetate and the rapid formation of aerobic granules under the selective conditions we confirmed that pdb can be enriched with acetate as the sole carbon source under highly selective conditions by analyzing the bacterial community we found that the pdb mainly acinetobacter were only abundantly present in the early stage of the ags and their abundance quickly decreased along the reactor operation furthermore we demonstrated that some bacterial species in the early stage ags could be easily attached to the biofilm carriers and are beneficial to develop biofilm with high phenol degradation ability in the mbbr systems taken together these findings improve our understanding of the microbial community evolution under highly selective conditions and the method developed in this study could be used for mbbr systems to enhance the removal of phenol and other refractory organic matters declaration of

18303,in this study we systematically investigated the bacterial community dynamics in highly selective strong hydraulic selection pressure and high organic loading rate bioreactors with acetate as the sole carbon source 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing and metagenomic sequencing results showed that phenolics degrading bacteria pdb which were mainly acinetobacter species in the newly formed aerobic granules could account for 70 of the total bacteria near full length 16s rrna gene sequences obtained by cloning suggest that the pdb are potentially novel species because they are distantly related to known acinetobacter species however these pdb only temporarily appeared in the early stage of the granule formation and their abundance quickly decreased along the reactor operation to retain these pdb we demonstrated that the newly formed aerobic granules could accelerate biofilm formation in moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs and the biofilm carriers showed gradually increased phenol degradation performance in the mbbrs while the bacterial community in biofilm significantly changed during the operation process of the mbbrs and the community structure became more complicated than that in the aerobic granules collectively this study provides new insights into the microbial ecology of sludge granulation and biofilm formation process in the wastewater treatment systems for remediating phenolic matters graphical abstract image 1 keywords biological wastewater treatment phenolics degrading bacteria aerobic granular sludge moving bed biofilm reactor metagenomics 1 introduction phenolics including phenol and its derivatives are common pollutants in industrial wastewater and are toxic to humans animals and microorganisms busca et al 2008 gupta et al 2004 biological degradation is considered as an efficient and cost effective approach to remove phenolic compounds from wastewater sarfaraz et al 2004 yamaga et al 2010 zhou et al 2018 however due to the toxicity of phenolic substances the startup period for bioreactors is usually long and reactor performance could be disturbed by concentration fluctuations oberoi and philip 2017 ramos et al 2017 therefore development of more efficient and stable biological phenolic wastewater treatment technologies is required as one of the most promising wastewater treatment technologies aerobic granular sludge ags has been intensively studied in the past two decades morales et al 2013 morgenroth et al 1997 pronk et al 2015 verawaty et al 2012 winkler et al 2015 jiang et al 2002 documented the application of ags to degrade toxic substrates which took approximately three months to acclimate municipal activated sludge using phenol and develop phenol degrading granules the long start up issue was later resolved by using acetate to cultivate ags and then introducing phenol as the co substrate tay et al 2005a the start up period was shortened to two weeks with acetate and phenol degradation reached stable within a week besides similar methods have also been applied to treating other refractory compounds such as 2 4 6 tri chlorophenol carucci et al 2008 4 chlorophenol carucci et al 2009 and p nitrophenol yarlagadda et al 2012 investigations based on microscopy and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that bacterial community changed before and after acclimation tay et al 2005b however to the best of our knowledge no study reported the loss of phenol degrading capacity along the reactor operation and the mechanisms and associated microbial community shift were also not comprehensively characterized such information is crucial for us to understand the granulation process and may lead to developing novel solutions for refractory compound degradation in addition to the regular ags a fast granulation strategy was recently proposed to cultivate aerobic granules under extreme selection pressures liu and tay 2015 zhang et al 2013 although the granulation process of aerobic granules has been well characterized the microbial mechanisms behind aerobic granulation and long term stability of granules remain unclear due to lack of knowledge of microbial community structures and functions while recent studies observed that specific taxa such as rhodocyclaceae xanthomonadaceae comamonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae adav et al 2010 lv et al 2014 xia et al 2018 are potentially important for the granulation process their functions are elusive which hinders our understanding of the granulation mechanism and the application of ags technology besides ags moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr is another promising biofilm based system that has been applied to treat wastewater bassin et al 2012 gilbert et al 2014 including phenolic wastewater li et al 2011 while the mbbr system has many advantages biofilm development on the surface of carrier materials could be very slow due to the presence of toxic matter or the absence of nutrients in wastewater bassin et al 2012 lee et al 2006 to overcome this issue it is necessary to develop novel approaches to accelerate biofilm formation and development on the carrier surface of mbbrs in this study we operated several sequencing batch reactors sbrs under strong hydraulic selection pressure hsp and high organic loading rate olr using acetate as the sole carbon source sludge granulation was achieved very quickly meanwhile a high abundance of phenolics degrading bacteria pdb appeared in the initial stage of the granulation process but disappeared along the reactor operation the microbial community dynamics during the acclimation process were systematically investigated using both high throughput sequencing and sanger sequencing based on the findings we developed a novel approach to rapidly startup mbbrs for efficient phenol degradation with the aid of newly formed aerobic granules 2 materials and methods 2 1 setup and operation of sbrs four sbrs r1 r2 r3 and r4 were operated to cultivate aerobic granules under strong hsp air velocity 2 4 cm s 2 min of settling after 111 min of aeration and high olr 6 g l d r1 r2 and r3 were used to assess the effects of organic loading reactor r1 vs r2 and seed sludge source r2 vs r3 on the process performance and r4 was used to investigate the bacterial community difference between the inner and outer granule layers the height and diameter of each reactor was 100 cm and 5 cm respectively the seeding sludge of r1 was taken from a municipal wastewater treatment plant w1 in nanjing china to repeat the sludge granulation process and phenol degrading performance r2 and r3 were started up with seeding sludge taken from w1 and another municipal wastewater treatment plant w2 in nanjing respectively to investigate the bacterial community in the inner and outer granule layers another reactor r4 was started with seeding sludge taken from w1 and operated with same operational parameters as r2 acetate was used as the sole carbon source for the four reactors nitrogen and phosphorus were supplied by nh4cl and kh2po4 respectively and their specific concentrations were shown in table s1 other nutrients adapted from lochmatter et al 2013 including 89 mg l 1 of mgso4 7h2o 27 mg l 1 of cacl2 2h2o 24 mg l 1 of feso4 7h2o 34 μg l 1 of znso4 7h2o 250 μg l 1 of mncl2 4h2o 6 μg l 1 of nh4 6mo7o24 4h2o 8 μg l 1 of cuso4 5h2o and 8 μg l 1 of cocl2 6h2o were also added to the influent the detailed operational parameters of the reactors are summarized in table s1 sludge samples were taken from the reactors periodically for dna extraction one sludge sample taken from r1 on day 8 was sorted using a series of metal sieves and the separated granules were collected for dna extraction while r2 and r3 were operated for 15 days the continuous operation of r1 was extended to 60 days to monitor long term performance 2 2 separation of inner and outer granule layers after reactor r4 was started up sludge samples were collected from the bioreactor periodically the inner core and outer layer of the granules taken on day 5 8 and 14 were carefully separated using a pair of sterile tweezers we carefully peeled off sludge from the surface of each granule until its diameter was reduced to approximately 2 3 of the original diameter to minimize operational errors the inner cores and outer layers of five granules taken on each day were respectively combined and used for dna extraction 2 3 batch experiment batch experiments were performed to examine the phenol degrading performance of the aerobic granules taken from the sbrs at different stages control experiments were conducted with municipal activated sludge the sludge concentration of the batch experiment was 100 mg l of suspended solids ss and the initial concentrations of phenol were 100 500 and 1000 mg l the water samples were collected at different times 0 0 5 2 6 10 24 48 72 and 96 h for phenol concentration analysis 2 4 moving bed biofilm reactor setup and operation in this study we found that the newly formed aerobic granules could accelerate biofilm formation on the biofilm carriers therefore three mbbrs mr1 mr2 and mr3 filled with kaldnes k3 carriers were operated to evaluate the performance of ags as seed sludge for biofilm development under different phenol concentrations mr1 and mr2 compared to municipal sludge as the seed mr3 each cylindrical mbbr has an effective working volume of 4l and the diameter and height are 16 cm and 20 cm respectively the influent was pumped into the reactor through the bottom and the effluent was discharged through the overflow weir at the top of each reactor for mr1 and mr2 the plastic biofilm carriers were first put into the above mentioned sbr r2 on the second day after startup and two days later the carriers were transferred into mr1 and mr2 for mr3 the plastic biofilm carriers were put into a regular activated sludge taken from w1 reactor and kept for two days then transferred into mr3 the detailed operational parameters of the mbbrs are shown in table s2 phenol was used as the sole carbon source for the three mbbrs and other nutrients were adapted from a previous study delatolla et al

with fewer than three sequences were removed the representative sequence of each otu was assigned taxonomy using the rdp classifier embedded in qiime with greengenes database mcdonald et al 2012 the sequences obtained from the clone library were compared with the sequences in the ncbi nucleotide database for taxonomy annotation using the blastn program a neighbour joining phylogenetic tree

performance under high olr and strong hsp three sbrs were operated under highly selective conditions i e high olr 6 12 g cod l d and strong hsp 2 min of settling after 111 min of aeration and with acetate as the substrate as a consequence aerobic granules formed rapidly in all three reactors regardless of the source of seeding sludge fig s1 the average size of granules in r1 continued to increase until reaching approximately 900 μm after 20 days and remained nearly constant during the rest period of operations fig s2a concurrent with granule formation the ss concentration in the reactors decreased significantly at the beginning of the reactor startup due to the strong hsp and gradually increased to 4500 5000 mg l in approximately 13 days fig s2b during this process the svi5 decreased from 160 to 50 60 ml g fig s2c suggesting the significant enhancement of the sludge settling interestingly batch experiments revealed high phenol degradation capacity of newly formed granules that were taken from the three reactors at day 2 at initial phenol concentrations of 100 or 500 mg l complete degradation was observed within 48 and 96 h respectively fig 1a and b a maximum degradation rate of 4 84 g cod g ss d was observed between 48 h and 72 h 1000 mg l phenol severely inhibited degradation as the phenol concentration only decreased by 10 after 100 h fig 1c these observations were supported by cod measurements fig s3 besides phenol 2 4 dichlorophenol another toxic and recalcitrant xenobiotic compound commonly present in wastewater can also be effectively degraded by newly formed ags fig s4 on the contrary older granules that were taken from the three reactors on day 15 exhibited decreasing phenol degradation capability with 100 mg l phenol concentration the removal efficiency was less than 30 within 96 h fig 1d the degradation was negligible at higher concentrations of 500 mg l and 1000 mg l fig 1e and f cod measurements agreed with these observations fig s3 d e and f the above results indicate that microorganisms capable of degrading phenolics were present in newly formed granules but absent in matured granules to illustrate the microbial community dynamics during the development of aerobic granules high throughput sequencing was applied to analyze the sludge samples taken from different stages during reactor operation 3 2 microbial community dynamics under the highly selective conditions 16s rrna gene high throughput sequencing revealed a clear bacterial community shift in r1 according to alpha diversity fig 2 a and beta diversity fig 2b the bacterial community was almost unchanged in the first 8 h after reactor startup and was similar to that of the seeding sludge drastic community shift began at the 14th hour and both the species richness and evenness decreased significantly the samples taken at different time were clearly clustered into four different groups fig 2b instead of betaproteobacteria which was most abundant in the seeding sludge gammaproteobacteria dominated the sludge bacterial community and accounted for 66 70 of the total 16s rrna gene reads fig 2c among the 1537 otus obtained from the sequencing results of the sludge samples otus affiliated with acinetobacter accounted for more than 70 of the total bacteria fig 2d however starting from day 5 betaproteobacteria otus zoogloea increased gradually and made up approximate 50 of total 16s rrna gene reads in day 8 samples its abundance then increased to nearly 80 in the samples taken on and after day 14 the abundance of acinetobacter declined concurrently and accounted for 10 of reads in the latter samples similar results were observed in the bacterial communities of the other two sbrs r2 and r3 fig s5 in all three reactors acinetobacter was the dominant genus at the initial stage of granule formation and was later replaced by zoogloea and other bacterial species this suggests that the community shift is a reproducible process under such conditions the appearance of acinetobacter coincided with the phenol degradation performance of the activated sludge and confirmed the successful enrichment of pdb from activated sludge with acetate in addition to the overall bacterial community in the ags we also analyzed the bacterial populations in the size separated granules taken from r1 on day 8 fig 2 as shown in fig 2c and d the relative abundance of acinetobacter in the smallest granules 0 22 mm accounted for approximately 40 of the total bacteria which was much higher than those in the larger granules accordingly as shown in fig 2b the smallest granules 0 22 mm were grouped with younger granules taken at day 5 and larger granules were grouped with samples taken after day 8 to further investigate the bacterial community in the inner and outer granule layers and elucidate the granule maturation process another reactor r4 was started with seeding sludge taken from w1 and operated with same operational parameters as r2 we separated the inner core and outer shell of granules taken on day 5 8 and 14 fig s6a and analyzed the bacterial community by high throughput sequencing of the 16s rrna gene as shown in fig s6b the higher abundance of acinetobacter was present in the inner layer of the granules fig s6b whereas zoogloea were more abundant in the outer shell to obtain full length 16s rrna gene sequences of the dominant populations and provide higher resolution to their phylogenetic novelty cloning and sequencing were performed with samples taken on days 5 and 60 from r1 nine acinetobacter 16s rrna gene sequences that were near full length were obtained and used to construct a phylogenic tree fig 3 the nine sequences formed two clusters one cluster contained four sequences and their average identity to acinetobacter johnsonii was 99 2 the sequences in the other cluster were relatively distant from cultured species and their average identity to the nearest cultured species acinetobacter junii was 96 8 this suggests that novel acinetobacter species might be present in the aerobic sludge although the number of sequences obtained from the clone library was limited the results fig s7 still demonstrated that high abundance of acinetobacter was present in the early stage while zoogloea became the dominant genera later which was consistent with results of the high throughput sequencing as previous studies have reported acinetobacter species degrading phenol chlorophenol and other aromatics kim and hao 1999 yamaga et al 2010 the high phenol degradation capability of the newly formed granules could be attributed to the acinetobacter species by analyzing more than 48g bp metagenomic sequencing data we obtained nine genome bins affiliated with acinetobacter table s3 this suggested that diverse acinetobacter species were present in the granules and coincided with the 16s rrna gene sequencing results although many genes related to the degradation of aromatics were observed in these bins fig s8 the completeness of these genome bins is not satisfactory 10 3 60 7 this might be caused by the highly similar sequences of these acinetobacter species micro diversity which significantly hampers genome assembly and segregation albertsen et al 2013 nelson et al 2016 genome mapping results fig s9 showed that a large proportion 17 4 34 3 of reads in samples taken in the early days days 1 and 5 could be mapped to acinetobacter genomes and few read were mapped to the zoogloea genome however starting from day 8 more reads were mapped to the zoogloea genome than the acinetobacter genomes this confirmed the 16s rrna gene sequencing results and suggested that significant bacterial community shift occurred during the aerobic granule formation process moreover fig s10 showed that plenty of reads were mapped to the genome of acinetobacter johnsonii similarly several sequences from the clone library are also closely related to acinetobacter johnsonii fig 3 this indicated that one or more species closely related to acinetobacter johnsonii might be present in the aerobic granules 3 3 retaining the pdb by biofilm formation it was found that the pdb acinetobacter only temporarily appeared in the granular formation process our efforts to retain a high abundance of acinetobacter in the sbr by adjusting the operational parameters including the olr and aeration intensity were not successful data not shown in order to retain the acinetobacter for phenol degradation plastic biofilm carriers were placed into the sbr r2 to develop biofilm on the second day after startup as expected visible biofilm was quickly formed on the carriers in two days fig 4c and d 16s rrna gene sequencing showed the relative abundance of acinetobacter in the formed biofilm on day 2 was 19 0 fig s11 suggesting the successful attachment of the acinetobacter on carriers the carriers with biofilm were then transferred into mbbr reactors 100 mg l phenol in influent and high phenol degradation efficiency approximately 66 was observed immediately after reactor startup fig 5 a the degradation efficiency gradually increased to 95 after day 50 for high phenol concentration 500 mg l the degradation efficiency reached 95 in 50 days fig 5b for comparison the same carriers were also placed in regular municipal activated sludge for two days but few biofilms were attached fig 5a and b when the carriers were transferred to a mbbr system the phenol degradation efficiency was very low 10 during the entire 60 day operating period fig 5c these results suggested that the biofilm formation with the aid of newly formed aerobic granules could not only accelerate biofilm formation on the carriers but also facilitate the startup of the mbbr system for phenol degradation along the operation of the mbbrs the bacterial community dynamics in the biofilms changed significantly the analysis results of mr1 and mr2 mr3 was not investigated due to the failure of biofilm development fig 4a and b showed that the microbial community structures in the mbbr samples are more complicated than that in the enriched granular sludge and over 40 of the 16s rrna gene sequences could not be assigned to known genera otus affiliated with acinetobacter accounted for about 19 0 of the total bacteria on day 2 samples taken from the mbbrs but the relative abundance of acinetobacter significantly decreased along the mbbr operation fig s11 despite this the phenol degradation performance gradually increased 4 discussion traditionally for refractory organic wastewater treatment the bacterial community is usually enriched or acclimatized with a gradually increased loading of the corresponding refractory organics adav et al 2007b majumder and gupta 2003 which usually lead to a relatively long startup period previous study showed that the start up period could be shortened by using acetate to cultivate aerobic granules tay et al 2005a in this study we confirmed that during the aerobic granule formation process under strong hsp and high olr a high abundance of pdb mainly acinetobacter can be rapidly enriched from regular municipal activated sludge with acetate as the sole carbon source while aerobic granule formation by combining strong hsp with high olr has been reported recently liu and tay 2015 we systematically revealed that the bacteria community changed significantly during the fast granule formation process and featured a decrease in microbial diversity this is distinct from the bacteria community in typical aerobic granule sludge which harbors diverse bacterial population including rhodocyclaceae xanthomonadaceae comamonadaceae and rhodobacteraceae xia et al 2018 the low bacterial richness was presumably due to the less complex substrates acetate as the sole carbon source high olr and strong hsp the olr might play a critical role in selecting the dominant bacteria population as the high olr in this study favored acinetobacter but a previous study gonzalez gil and holliger 2011 enriched thiothrix in ags with acetate under low olr 1 8 g cod l d novel acinetobacter species might be present in the reactors of this study according to the 16s rrna gene and metagenomic analysis however due to the limitations of shot gun metagenomic sequencing and the micro diversity issue albertsen et al 2013 nelson et al 2016 the complete genomes of these species were not successfully obtained future efforts should be made to obtain more complete genomes of these species and explore the functional traits by means of pure culture isolation and more advanced sequencing and bioinformatic approaches acinetobacter has been observed in aerobic granules by previous studies adav et al 2007a jemaat et al 2014 lv et al 2014 even as the sole species forming aerobic granules adav and lee 2008 in this study under highly selective conditions most bacteria were washed out and only a few bacterial species were retained to form granules the enrichment of acinetobacter confirmed their significant roles in the process of aerobic granule formation this was probably due to their capacity of producing extracellular polymeric substances eps and serving as nucleus of the granules kang and park 2010 pirog et al 2003 however we found that acinetobacter only temporally appeared in the initial stage of the granules analysis of different sized granules showed that acinetobacter were only abundant in the small and young granules 0 22 μm this is probably due to the fact that other bacteria such as zoogloea and hydrogenophaga could adhere to the surface of nucleus formed by acinetobacter and proliferate under high olr conditions after the acinetobacter dominated nucleus was covered by other bacterial species their growth could be inhibited due to limited access of oxygen as most acinetobacter species are strictly aerobic anandham et al 2010 luna and aruj 2007 biofilm formation is a key process for the startup and stable operation of the mbbr and other biofilm reactors nicolella et al 2000 zhu et al 2015 usually for industrial wastewater treatment a relatively long startup period is needed to acclimate the biofilm by increasing the concentration of the refractory organic matter gradually zhou et al 2018 in this study we accelerated the biofilm formation with the aid of newly formed aerobic granules which harbor a high abundance of acinetobacter species in this genus could produce eps and have strong self aggregation ability and adhesion capability to form biofilm and attach to the carrier surface pirog et al 2002 yadav et al 2012 although acinetobacter species could be successfully attached to the carriers the bacterial community in the biofilm shifted significantly along mbbr operation process and the relative abundance of acinetobacter decreased after the startup of mbbrs fig s11 this indicates that some other pdb such as sphingobium microbacterium etc might proliferate in the biofilm in addition the operational conditions especially oxygen concentration and loading rate in the mbbr and the sbr systems are quite different probably some bacteria that did not involve in phenol degradation in sbrs may contribute to do so in the mbbrs due to having different metabolic pathways therefore future studies are needed to reveal the mechanism of the bacterial community shift in the biofilm of the mbbr systems and investigate the phenol degradation ability of acinetobacter and other bacterial species in wastewater treatment bioreactors from an engineering application point of view the pdb quickly enriched from municipal activated sludge under highly selective conditions could be used for bioaugmentation which is an effective technology for the removal of phenols from wastewater poi et al 2017 in addition the rapid biofilm formation method harnessing the adhesion ability of the newly formed granules proposed in this study could be used for accelerating the startup of biofilm reactor for treating phenol and other phenolic compounds which could be more rapid than the traditional startup methods zhou et al 2018 5 conclusion in this study based on the previous reports on the enrichment of pdb with acetate and the rapid formation of aerobic granules under the selective conditions we confirmed that pdb can be enriched with acetate as the sole carbon source under highly selective conditions by analyzing the bacterial community we found that the pdb mainly acinetobacter were only abundantly present in the early stage of the ags and their abundance quickly decreased along the reactor operation furthermore we demonstrated that some bacterial species in the early stage ags could be easily attached to the biofilm carriers and are beneficial to develop biofilm with high phenol degradation ability in the mbbr systems taken together these findings improve our understanding of the microbial community evolution under highly selective conditions and the method developed in this study could be used for mbbr systems to enhance the removal of phenol and other refractory organic matters declaration of

18304,in several jurisdictions the arithmetic mean of escherichia coli concentrations in raw water serves as the metric to set minimal treatment requirements by drinking water treatment plants dwtps an accurate and precise estimation of this mean is therefore critical to define adequate requirements distributions of e coli concentrations in surface water can be heavily skewed and require statistical methods capable of characterizing uncertainty we present four simple parametric models with different upper tail behaviors gamma log normal lomax mixture of two log normal distributions to explicitly account for the influence of peak events on the mean concentration the performance of these models was tested using large e coli data sets 200 1800 samples from raw water regulatory monitoring at six dwtps located in urban and agricultural catchments critical seasons of contamination and hydrometeorological factors leading to peak events were identified event based samples were collected at an urban dwtp intake during two hydrometeorological events using online β d glucuronidase activity monitoring as a trigger results from event based sampling were used to verify whether selected parametric distributions predicted targeted peak events we found that the upper tail of the log normal and the lomax distributions better predicted large concentrations than the upper tail of the gamma distribution weekly sampling for two years in urban catchments and for four years in agricultural catchments generated reasonable estimates of the average raw water e coli concentrations the proposed methodology can be easily used to inform the development of sampling strategies and statistical indices to set site specific treatment requirements graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water escherichia coli hydrometeorology exposure assessment quantitative microbial risk assessment event based sampling 1 introduction the world health organization s who water quality guidelines recommend a preventive and risk based approach for drinking water quality management for this purpose a spectrum of microbial risk assessment approaches is available from simple sanitary inspections and risk matrices to more complex ones such as quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra who 2016b the qmra approach can provide relative estimates of microbial risks at drinking water treatment plants dwtps which may be particularly useful to prioritize investments in improving water treatment or in implementing source water protection measures however in many situations data on pathogen occurrence and concentrations in raw water are not available at dwtps and only faecal indicator bacteria fib are measured to characterize source water quality therefore to support the implementation of a source to tap approach simplified classification methods known as bin classification were developed to determine minimum treatment requirements according to a specific level of fib concentrations in raw water different summary statistics e g mean concentration maximum concentration and sampling strategies e g weekly sampling monthly sampling event based sampling are specified in regulatory requirements worldwide for bin classification table a1 the arithmetic mean is a valid metric for characterizing microbial concentrations in order to characterize the risk of multiple exposures to low doses of pathogens haas 1996 the annual mean is usually considered in qmra because annual health based targets are recommended in guidelines and regulations sinclair et al 2015 precise estimation of the mean is challenging for surface water because microbial concentrations can vary over several orders of magnitude within hours or days burnet et al 2019a this metric relies on the law of large numbers as the sample size grows its sample mean gets closer to the true mean however the meaning of large depends on the distribution of the data the convergence is much faster for normal or thin tailed distribution than for heavy tailed distributions if the variance is very large any new observation can be large enough to overwhelm all previous observations regardless of the number of accumulated observations numerous studies have shown that heavy rainfall can rapidly increase microbial contamination loads in water atherholt et al 1998 burnet et al 2014 2019a kistemann et al 2002 signor et al 2005 in urban areas combined sewer overflow cso discharges induced by heavy rainfall or snowmelt events can cause recurring microbial peaks in raw water at dwtps jalliffier verne et al 2016 madoux humery et al 2016 in agricultural areas similar heavy rainfall episodes can increase microbial contamination of surface waters as a result of overland transport tile drainage systems and resuspension from stream sediments e g dorner et al 2006 a statistical approach was proposed to incorporate such peak events in the risk assessment for a hypothetical frequency of occurrence petterson et al 2006 however methods for the estimation of peak event frequency have not been proposed yet stochastic models are used in other fields to evaluate the frequency of extreme precipitation events katz et al 2002 streamflow peaks katz et al 2002 and extreme pollution from runoff harremoës 1988 these models have implications for quantifying the frequency of extreme events at dwtps but have not been utilized in the context of microbial safety of drinking water in quebec canada raw water e coli concentrations are measured since 2013 at least weekly for large dwtps 10 000 inhabitants these extensive datasets provide a unique opportunity to study temporal variations in different catchments the objective of the study was to first develop a methodology to correctly estimate the mean e coli concentrations in surface drinking water sources by considering peak events large routine monitoring datasets from six dwtps were fitted with parametric distributions having different upper tail behaviors for the best fit distributions we then evaluated the required minimum sample size to estimate the mean concentration for different ranges of uncertainty secondly key contributors to the mean concentration level were identified by examining the influence of seasonality and hydrometeorological factors on temporal variations finally we conducted event based sampling during two hydrometeorological events at an urban dwtp to evaluate whether the selected parametric distributions predicted these targeted peak events implications for the development of sampling strategies and probabilistic models are discussed for setting health based drinking water treatment requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites six dwtps fed by rivers located in urban and agricultural catchments were selected and classified by the mean annual river flow rate in ascending order from a to d table 1 dwtp c2 is located downstream dwtp c1 wastewater treatment plants wwtps cso discharge points and the dominant land cover type were identified for areas 15 km upstream of the drinking water intakes in quebec csos are equipped with recording devices to measure the frequency and the daily cumulative duration of discharges gouvernement du québec 2015 cso discharges are forbidden during dry periods but are permitted with restrictions during rainfall and snowmelt episodes canadian council of ministers of the environment 2007 gouvernement du québec 2015 in agricultural areas manure must be spread on unfrozen soils between april and october gouvernement du québec 2018 2 2 hydrometeorological data the impact of hydrometeorology on the variations in raw water e coli concentrations at dwtp c1 were investigated to identify critical periods of contamination for event based sampling daily river flow rate snow cover and total precipitation were obtained from online databases river flow rate was measured at a provincial gauging station 5 km downstream of dwtp c1 the other parameters were obtained from the montreal pierre elliott trudeau international airport weather station environment and climate change canada 2018 located 17 km south of the dwtp 2 3 regulatory e coli monitoring escherichia coli was chosen as an indicator of microbial water quality because of its widespread use in drinking water regulations and because it provides evidence of recent faecal pollution who 2011 depending on the dwtp we obtained routine e coli monitoring results for five to nine years between 2009 and 2017 raw water samples were collected daily from monday to thursday daily m t or once a week between monday and thursday weekly all samples were collected during regular working hours from 9 00 to 18 00 e coli was enumerated with plate counts on ec mug medium american public health association 2005 by membrane filtration using modified membrane thermotolerant e coli agar modified mtec epa method 1603 or by the defined substrate technology using the idexx quanti tray 2000 system with colilert reagent american public health association 2005 e coli concentrations were reported either in most probable number mpn or colony forming unit cfu per 100 ml two ten fold serial dilutions 0 1 0 01 were carried out for the modified mtec method to obtain countable ranges of 20 80 cfus per plate and no dilution with countable ranges of 1 2419 mpn 100 ml was applied with colilert hence the upper limit of detection with this modified mtec and the colilert methods were 8000 cfu 100 ml and 2420 mpn 100 ml respectively non detect values were replaced with a limit of detection of 1 e coli 100 ml for statistical analyses this simple approach for handling non detects has a negligible impact on statistical inference because at these dwtps the proportions of non detects are small 5 poisson mixture distributions could be used to handle non detects in cases where their proportion would be higher burnet et al 2019b observed a strong correlation r 0 94 between membrane filtration and the colilert assay at dwtp c1 for ease of interpretation all e coli results were presented as e coli 100 ml 2 4 indices for the identification of heavy tails two simple measures were considered to evaluate the statistical dispersion of each empirical distribution of e coli concentrations the kurtosis was selected to evaluate if infrequent extreme deviations were captured in historical data a high kurtosis can indicate that tail events are not properly characterized and that the true mean could be higher than the sample mean the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean absolute deviation mad was further examined as it increases with the heavy tailedness of the distribution taleb 2015 2 5 statistical inference of e coli concentrations statistical inference was undertaken based on reported e coli concentrations to draw conclusions on the mean concentration and its uncertainty continuous distributions were selected to describe the variation in e coli concentrations without taking into account the random poisson distribution of counts because only data in the form of concentration measurements were available the variations in faecal indicator concentrations in water are often described using log normal distributions thomas 1955 ott 1994 here we evaluated how the gamma log normal and lomax distributions described the variations in raw water e coli concentrations at each dwtp those distributions were selected because they have different simple underlying generative processes frank 2014 and embrace a spectrum of tail behaviors haas 1997 the lomax distribution also known as pareto type ii has not previously been selected to describe the variability of microbial contamination in water but has many applications in natural sciences newman 2005 sornette 2006 this distribution can be interpreted as an exponential distribution with a power law tail the power law tail is characterized by a much slower decay as compared to an exponential distribution two different approaches were adopted for statistical inference first a bayesian approach was applied for the inference of the three candidate distributions distributions were parametrized by shape k and scale θ gamma mean μ and standard deviation σ log normal or shape α and scale λ lomax table 2 the parameters were provided with broad noncommittal prior distributions so that the prior had a minimal influence on the posterior kruschke et al 2014 a sample of posterior parameter pairs was constructed using a markov chain monte carlo procedure using gibbs sampling the models were specified and run in jags v4 2 0 plummer 2003 from r v3 4 1 r core team 2014 markov chain monte carlo methods were performed using rjags v4 6 plummer 2013 four markov chains were implemented for each parameter the model was run for 104 iterations after a burn in phase of 103 iterations the brooks gelman rubin scale reduction factor indicated that convergence was obtained for each of these four chains gelman and shirley 2011 the uncertainty on the parameter values of the bayesian models and the predicted mean concentration was then evaluated the goodness of fit of each bayesian model was measured with the deviance information criterion dic spiegelhalter et al 2002 as follows 1 d i c 2 l p where l is the log likelihood of the data given the posterior means of the parameters and p is an estimate of the effective number of the parameter in the model gelman et al 2013 a lower dic indicates a better model fit a second method was applied for statistical inference because bimodality was observed at dwtp b and only normal mixture models were available in jags maximum likelihood estimation was computed for a mixture of two gamma distributions and for a mixture of two log normal distributions via expectation maximization algorithms with the r package mixr yu 2018 the goodness of fit of these two distribution models was measured with the deviance the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic aic and bic also reward goodness of fit and includes a penalty that is a function of the number of estimated parameters the uncertainty on the parameter values of the mixture models and the predicted mean concentrations was not evaluated source codes are provided in the supplementary material section b 2 6 minimum sample size determination the minimum sample size required to accurately estimate the true mean of a log normal distribution for different confidence intervals was determined by iterations with the cox method olsson 2005 the confidence interval for a log normal distribution with a mean μ and the standard deviation σ is 2 μ σ 2 z σ 2 n σ 4 2 n 1 where the value of z to evaluate the 95 confidence interval is 1 96 and n is the sample size 2 7 identification of critical contamination periods lorenz curves cowell 2000 were used to summarize the quantile share information contained in empirical e coli distributions to produce these graphs e coli samples were ordered by their concentration starting with the lowest and then plotted against the cumulative proportion of the ordered samples running from zero to one along the horizontal axis ordinary lorenz curve values were multiplied by the mean concentration to evaluate the distributions of e coli concentrations in terms of long term mean concentrations this curve is known as a generalized lorenz curve shorrocks 1983 the generalized lorenz curves were computed with the r package ineq zeileis 2014 long term and seasonal variations were assessed the seasons were defined as winter dec feb spring mar may summer june aug and fall sept nov the short term variability in e coli concentrations was examined at dwtp c1 from january to april snowmelt period between 2013 and 2017 the observed variables were e coli concentrations the flow rate of the river the snow cover and the daily precipitation an online instrument measuring β d glucuronidase gluc activity coliminder vwm gmbh vienna austria was installed at the dwtp intake to characterize periods of high variability in microbial contamination during the 2017 snowmelt period the technology was used to track e coli at near real time frequency following field and laboratory validation completed by burnet et al 2019b detailed technical information about the technology can be found in koschelnik et al 2015 the instrument was installed at the intake of the dwtp in november 2016 and measured gluc activity every 2 h gluc activity measurements obtained during the first month after the installation allowed to differentiate baseline from peak levels of contamination during and following autumn and winter rainfall episodes during periods of high fluctuations of the gluc activity level we adjusted the measurements to hourly frequency based on the short term dynamics of the gluc activity two snowmelt events were identified grab samples were collected every three to 5 h for 20 h during a first gluc activity peak in february 2017 and for 60 h during a second gluc activity peak in april 2017 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics the sample mean of e coli concentrations in raw water varied between dwtps from 22 to 507 e coli 100 ml table 3 overall the mean and the mean absolute deviation mad decreased with the mean flow rate of the river a 0 2 log10 increase in the mean and mad was observed between dwtp c1 and c2 dwtps b c2 and e displayed the highest sd to mad ratio the kurtosis was greater than 155 at dwtps c2 and e but was only 25 at dwtp b indicating potential bimodality of the empirical distribution 3 2 distribution selection best fit parameters of the gamma lomax and log normal distributions at dwtps a and b predicted differences up to 0 5 log10 between the lowest estimated mean concentrations and the highest estimated mean concentrations table 4 for dwtps a and b the predicted means of the lomax distribution were higher than for the gamma and log normal distributions the uncertainty on the predicted mean of the lomax distribution was not stable at dwtps a and b since the mean concentration was not defined when the value of the shape parameter α was less than 1 0 the tail had infinite area the differences among the predicted mean of the three models at dwtps c1 c2 d and e was less than 0 1 log10 the influence of the behavior of the tail of a distribution on the predicted mean is discussed in section 4 1 to define what is an important difference in dic for the selection of a model spiegelhalter et al 2002 suggested to apply the same rules of thumb as was proposed by burnham and anderson 2004 for the akaike information criterion aic differences in aic within 1 2 of the best model minimum aic value deserve consideration and differences within 3 7 have considerably less support therefore the log normal or the lomax distribution better fitted the observed data than the gamma distribution at all dwtps table 4 at dwtp b the difference in dic was small between the log normal distribution and the lomax distribution gamma mixture and lognormal mixture distributions were also considered for dwtp b table 5 the deviance of the mixture of two log normal distributions was much lower than the deviance of the lomax distribution deviance of 3057 with the mixture models a distribution was fitted to the tail of the observations at a probability of exceedance of 14 for the gamma model and 6 for the log normal model the difference between the sample mean and the combined predicted mean of the mixture models was lower than 0 1 log10 3 3 posterior predictive checks cumulative distribution function cdf and complementary cdf ccdf plots were produced to illustrate the fit of the gamma log normal and lomax distributions to routine monitoring data overall the gamma distribution accurately estimated the sample mean table 4 but overestimated low concentrations fig 1 and underestimated large concentrations fig 2 the power law tail of the lomax distribution predicted higher concentrations than the tail of the log normal distribution when the value of the scale parameter λ was lower than the sample mean at dwtp e the dic of the lomax distribution was higher than the dic of the log normal distribution even if the lomax distribution was a better fit for the tail events the bulk of the distribution where most of the samples were located was therefore log normally distributed but not the tail fig 3 shows that the mixture of two log normal distributions provided a better fit to the empirical tail than the unimodal distributions at dwtp b the log normal distribution fit on the highest values only describes the variability of around 5 of the data suggesting that specific conditions such as hydrometeorological events could generate a different probability pattern than baseline conditions in this agricultural catchment 3 4 sample size determination the value of the parameter sigma of the log normal distribution had an important influence on the minimum sample size at dwtps a c1 c2 and d table 6 a sigma increase of 0 4 doubled the minimum sample size from dwtp d to dwtp a for all dwtps a three fold increase in minimum sample size was required to reduce the range of the confidence interval from 0 5 log10 to 0 3 log10 a ten fold increase was needed to reduce that range from 0 3 log10 to 0 1 log10 3 5 seasonal variations of e coli concentrations the generalized lorenz curves show that a small proportion of samples contributes highly to the long term mean fig 4 in each graph the black diagonal line represents perfect equality where each sample would have the same contribution to the mean concentration therefore the more the empirical curve deviates from the diagonal the more the tail of the distribution contributes to the mean for example at dwtp b the long term mean illustrated with the black curve breaks at a mean concentration of approximately 100 e coli 100 ml the bimodality of the empirical distribution causes that break from this point around 10 of the total number of samples also 10 of the total period at the dwtp increases the long term mean from 100 e coli 100 ml to 387 e coli 100 ml an increase of 0 6 log10 these curves can also describe the seasonality of the contamination seasonal and annual means are illustrated by the maximum value of their generalized lorenz curve a seasonal distribution has more influence on the annual mean when the maximum value of a seasonal curve is higher than the maximum value of the annual curve thus the annual mean was mostly influenced by summer and fall conditions in the agricultural catchments dwtps a b and by winter or spring conditions in the urban catchments dwtps c1 c2 e smaller differences between seasons were observed at dwtp d 3 6 short term variations of e coli concentrations time series analysis of hydrometeorological factors and raw water e coli concentrations were used to identify periods of high contamination at dwtp c1 from january 2013 to april 2016 fig 5 peak concentrations over 1000 e coli 100 ml were frequently detected during the snowmelt period usually occurring from march to april however these peak events were not always detected during the rapid decline of the snow cover e g march april 2013 in 2016 precipitation in winter was dominated by rainfall rather than snow and no peaks were observed these different hydrometeorological conditions had a noticeable impact on the annual distribution of e coli concentrations at dwtp c1 the annual mean was 341 e coli 100 ml for 2014 and 146 e coli 100 ml for 2016 a difference of 0 4 log10 in 2017 event based sampling revealed the influence of hydrometeorological factors on the short term dynamics of e coli concentrations fig 6 for the february event e coli concentrations varied from 161 to 2247 e coli 100 ml within 7 h and reached a maximum concentration of 2420 e coli 100 ml concentrations higher than 1000 e coli 100 ml were observed for 21 h no routine samples were collected because the event happened over the weekend the april peak occurred during the week and was also sampled during routine monitoring e coli concentrations varied from 440 to 3684 e coli 100 ml and concentrations higher than 1000 e coli 100 ml were observed for 66 h the maximum daily mean concentrations during the february and april peaks were 1588 e coli 100 ml and 2567 e coli 100 ml respectively both daily mean concentrations were higher than the 97th percentile 8 years of data of daily m t sampling the maximum concentrations sampled during the april peak was higher than the maximum concentration sampled in 8 years of routine monitoring data maximum daily mean concentrations from event based sampling are represented with vertical lines on the ccdf plot fig 7 both lines crossed the tails of the modeled distributions thus tail events were captured with the event based sampling strategy the probability of occurrence of the event was back calculated for each distribution the gamma distribution did not predict the maximum daily mean during the april peak the log normal distribution predicted a frequency of occurrence of these daily peaks between two to twenty days per year the lomax distribution predicted these events at a lower frequency varying between two days a year and one day every five years 4 discussion 4 1 optimizing distribution selection to describe e coli variations in source water candidate parametric distributions were selected to fit raw water e coli measurements the following underlying generative processes of distributions were considered for the selection the combination of small scale processes at a higher aggregate scale tends to yield a common probability distribution consistent with given constraints that maximize the entropy frank 2009 a maximization of entropy with a constraint on the arithmetic mean results in an exponential distribution if the constraint is on the mean logarithm then observations follow a power law distribution the scaling often changes between linear and logarithmic as magnitude changes the gamma distribution is a product of a power law x k 1 and an exponential function e x θ table 2 at small magnitudes the scaling is logarithmic because the power law component dominates and at large magnitudes the scaling is linear because the exponential function dominates the value of k 1 θ determines the magnitude at which those scales dominate thus only the linear scaling of the gamma distribution dominated at all dwtps because k was less than 1 0 table 3 the lomax distribution has the inverse scale a linear log scaling thus it can be understood as an exponential distribution with a power law tail the scale parameter λ indicates the level at which the distribution changes from a linear scaling to a logarithmic scaling this parameter can be viewed as a power law tail threshold therefore the logarithm scaling starts at a concentration below the sample mean at dwtps a b and e and above the sample mean at dwtps c1 c2 d table 3 a disadvantage of the lomax distribution is that the predicted mean is not finite when the value of the shape parameter α is below 1 0 truncated lévy distributions can be considered in these cases mantegna and stanley 1995 koponen 1995 mariani and liu 2007 these distributions still have a power law form but with infinite tail truncated or exponential cut offs the log normal distribution follows a gaussian distribution on the log scale therefore the information dissipates on the additive log scale and the generative process is multiplicative at all dwtps the tail of the log normal and the lomax distributions predicted the observed concentrations better than the tail of the gamma distribution fig 2 log normal and power law distributions have similar multiplicative processes the argument as to whether one is more accurate than the other has arisen across a variety of fields mitzenmacher 2004 under general conditions the power law tail can be obtained with the inclusion of an additive term to the basic multiplicative process this additive term is added only when the system crosses a lower threshold acting as a barrier preventing collapse to zero sornette and cont 1997 hence hydrometeorological events could be generating this lower threshold and produce power law behavior in the distributions as it was observed at dwtp e the kurtosis and the sd to mad ratio are proposed as indices to identify the behavior of the tail of the distribution the log normal distribution produced only a conservative bound for tail observations when the sd to mad ratio was less than 2 0 dwtps a c1 d at a higher ratio dwtps b c2 e the log normal distributions could not conservatively estimate all observations fig 2 however the sample kurtosis was much smaller at dwtp b than at dwtps c2 and e table 3 at dwtp b the measure of the deviance table 5 and the posterior predictive check fig 3 indicated that the mixture of two log normal distributions better fitted e coli concentrations than the lomax distribution the hypothesis of a bimodal behavior in the distribution of environmental contaminants was previously suggested pollard et al 2002 the evaluation of a bimodal behavior at dwtp b was necessary because the lomax distribution predicted a much higher mean concentration than the sample mean dwtps c2 and e had sample kurtosis greater than 155 the power law tail of the lomax distribution predicted observed data at dwtp e the value of the shape parameter α of 1 7 was large enough to calculate a finite credible interval on the mean table 3 at dwtp c2 only one sample with a concentration of 11 000 e coli 100 ml increased the sd to mad ratio from 1 80 to 2 46 and the kurtosis from 40 to 155 differences between the sample and predicted mean of the best fit model were lower than 0 1 log10 at all dwtps therefore the sample mean was a reliable index to estimate the true mean raw water e coli concentration at these dwtps in other words the evaluated sample sizes were large enough to converge to the true mean of the log normal distribution dwtps a c1 c2 d the mixture of two log normal distributions dwtp b and the lomax distribution dwtp e however it is possible that actual peak concentrations may be underestimated because of upper limit of detection in this dataset this was the case for 3 245 samples reaching the upper limits of detection of 8000 cfu 100 ml at dwtp b and 4 1584 samples reaching 2419 mpn 100 ml at dwtp c1 this could underestimate the size of the upper tail hence the number of dilutions should always be carefully selected to avoid dealing with an upper limit of detection when data are collected for statistical inference 4 2 evaluation of the sample size to estimate mean of e coli concentrations at dwtp intakes required confidence or credible intervals on mean estimates are usually not indicated in guidelines and regulations table a1 the estimates of the mean concentrations are used to determine minimum treatment targets usually quantified in log10 reduction values a large uncertainty on the mean will increase the probability of misclassification of a treatment bin category health based targets will not be met if treatment requirements are underestimated while unnecessary costly treatment processes will be added if treatment requirements are overestimated to reduce the uncertainty to an appropriate level we are proposing the use of the cox method to determine the minimum sample size when the best fit distribution is log normal weekly sampling for two years n 104 allowed the estimation of the true mean with a 95 confidence interval of 0 3 log10 at dwtps c1 c2 and d table 6 four years of weekly sampling n 208 would be required at dwtp a to reach 0 3 log10 these sample sizes should be doubled to reduce the uncertainty to 0 2 log10 therefore the lowest 95 confidence interval achievable with a reasonable number of samples would be 0 3 log10 these results are site specific because they depend on the variance of the dataset a conservative value of the variance could be assumed to determine the minimum sample size for a group of dwtps other mathematical approaches should be considered to estimate the minimum sample size when observations follow lomax or mixture distributions in these cases the required minimum sample sizes to estimate the true mean with a 95 confidence interval could be higher than those determined for the log normal distributions an estimation of the mean concentration with results from weekly sampling strategies for 1 year as regulated in quebec for large dwtps n 52 samples was sufficient to reach a confidence interval of around 0 4 log10 in urban rivers dwtps c1 c2 d but not in the studied agricultural river dwtp a where the confidence interval was larger than 0 5 log10 monthly sampling for two years n 24 samples as required by the us epa in rivers where the arithmetic mean is lower than 50 e coli 100 ml would only predict the mean with a confidence interval lower than 0 5 log10 if the variance is small value of the sigma parameter lower than 1 1 which is lower than observed at the sites in this study the variance of the e coli concentrations was higher for dwtps fed by the small rivers dwtps a and b that are more subject to episodic changes in water quality therefore robust methods for the design of sampling strategies should consider water quality variability particularly in small agricultural catchments 4 3 integrating peak microbial contamination events accounting for hydrometeorological events is an important issue for the quantification of microbial treatment requirements petterson et al 2015 peak events need to be considered as they represent challenging periods for dwtps as illustrated by major waterborne outbreaks in the past e g curriero et al 2001 hrudey et al 2002 thomas et al 2006 the collection of event based samples in addition to routine monitoring has been proposed in who guidance documents who 2016a who 2016b who 2017 in the netherlands incidental samples must be collected when peak concentrations in pathogen counts are assumed to occur vrom inspectorate 2005 as demonstrated in this study new statistical approaches are needed to incorporate this information into risk assessment routine samples are quasi independent and identically distributed i i d random variables this property implies that a given sample is independent of the previously collected sample alternatively event based samples are not i i d random variables and cannot be combined with routine samples for statistical inference however event based samples can be used to 1 evaluate short term exposure e g maximum daily risk and 2 evaluate if peak concentrations are included or excluded from the tail of a parametric distribution inferred with routine monitoring data short term variations of e coli were measured at dwtp c1 during and following two hydrometeorological events during the snowmelt period in 2017 instead of relying on precipitation data we used a microbial surrogate to time our event based sampling online measurement of gluc activity can be used as a reliable surrogate to identify periods of high e coli concentrations burnet et al 2019a b for the collection of samples the maximum daily mean concentrations of 1588 e coli 100 ml in february and 2567 e coli 100 ml in april were higher than the 97th percentile and the 99th percentile retrieved from eight years of daily m t monday to thursday sampling respectively concentrations exceeding 1000 e coli 100 ml were continuously measured for about one day in february and during three days in april as such we demonstrated that online gluc activity measurement based sampling strategy is suitable for the detection of critical periods of e coli contamination in an urban river during the snowmelt period this sampling strategy could be applied to target pathogen monitoring programs or study variations of pathogen concentrations in source water during hydrometeorological events the ccdf plot for dwtp c1 showed that the gamma distribution could not predict the maximum daily mean concentrations during the april event fig 7 the maximum daily mean concentrations of these two events crossed the ccdf curves of the log normal and the lomax distributions the log normal distribution predicted a frequency of occurrence of these daily peaks between two to twenty days per year therefore the log normal distribution was a conservative bound for peak events if these maximum daily mean concentrations occurred less than 20 days a year in this case weekly sampling for two years estimated the true mean with a confidence interval of 0 3 log10 table 6 and included the influence of these peak events 4 4 identifying key contributors to peak events in agricultural and urban rivers the protection of drinking water sources is a preventive approach to minimize the influence of peak events on the mean concentration and thereby ensure adequate health based treatment requirements we introduced generalized lorenz curves as quantitative tools to determine how critical contamination periods influence the long term mean e coli concentrations for four dwtps the identification of these periods could guide the implementation of source water protection measures the combined annual generalized lorenz curves indicated that peak events had more influence on the mean concentration in small agricultural rivers dwtps a and b than in large urban rivers dwtps c1 c2 d fig 4 seasonal contributions to the long term mean e coli concentrations were different between urban and agricultural catchments for agricultural rivers the long term mean was driven by samples collected during summer and fall the conditions leading to the bimodal behavior of the distribution at dwtp b should be further investigated with hydrometeorological and land use data to identify potential factors triggering a different generative process for the distribution of tail events two primary sources of contamination could contribute to the observed pattern since four csos and one wwtp are located upstream of the dwtp during rainfall the combined effect of these two sources could generate a different distribution in the urban rivers critical periods of contamination at dwtps were winter and spring at dwtp c1 rapid snowmelt had more influence than rainfall on the variation of e coli concentrations and recurrent peak events were observed at low flow rates in 2014 and 2015 fig 5 at dwtp c1 and c2 treated effluent discharges but also sewage by passes at wwtps and cso discharges during snowmelt periods likely influence the behavior of the tail of the distribution burnet et al 2019a at dwtp d madoux humery et al 2016 showed that approximately 80 of e coli peak concentrations were linked to cso discharges caused by daily precipitation exceeding 10 mm or by spring snowmelt here we show that these peaks could be predicted by a log normal distribution fig 2 and that weekly sampling for two years n 104 samples at the dwtp enables to estimate the true mean concentration with a confidence interval of 0 3 log10 table 6 5 conclusions we have shown that it is possible to use simple parametric models and graphical tools to consider different tail behaviors for the evaluation of the mean e coli concentration in raw water the application of this approach to large data sets collected with routine and event based monitoring strategies at six drinking water treatment plants located in different types of catchments demonstrated that weekly sampling for two years in urban catchments and for four years in agricultural catchments produce reasonable estimates of the average raw water e coli concentrations and encompass peak event concentrations log normal lomax and a mixture of log normal distributions could best predict high e coli concentrations in raw water the kurtosis and the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean absolute deviation mad are useful indices for identifying sites vulnerable to peak e coli concentrations the log normal distribution fitted on extensive weekly monitoring data conservatively predicted peak e coli concentrations as measured during two snowmelt events at a drinking water treatment plant under the influence of un treated sewage discharges although the log normal distribution appears to be the best default choice extending our findings should be done carefully considering the specificities of plausible but exceptional hydrometeorological and contamination events the generalized lorenz curves show that a small proportion of samples predominantly contributes to the average e coli concentrations in agricultural catchments critical seasons of high contamination levels were summer and fall in the agricultural catchment and winter and spring in urban catchments the characterization of site specific variations can promote the effective implementation of mitigation measures to address contamination sources with the highest influence on the average e coli concentrations at drinking water treatment plant intakes the data collection and model validation methods described in this paper could be adapted for pathogens to explicitly consider hydrometeorological events in the quantification of microbial treatment targets given the growing importance of considering peak events in setting treatment requirements additional studies confirming

18304,in several jurisdictions the arithmetic mean of escherichia coli concentrations in raw water serves as the metric to set minimal treatment requirements by drinking water treatment plants dwtps an accurate and precise estimation of this mean is therefore critical to define adequate requirements distributions of e coli concentrations in surface water can be heavily skewed and require statistical methods capable of characterizing uncertainty we present four simple parametric models with different upper tail behaviors gamma log normal lomax mixture of two log normal distributions to explicitly account for the influence of peak events on the mean concentration the performance of these models was tested using large e coli data sets 200 1800 samples from raw water regulatory monitoring at six dwtps located in urban and agricultural catchments critical seasons of contamination and hydrometeorological factors leading to peak events were identified event based samples were collected at an urban dwtp intake during two hydrometeorological events using online β d glucuronidase activity monitoring as a trigger results from event based sampling were used to verify whether selected parametric distributions predicted targeted peak events we found that the upper tail of the log normal and the lomax distributions better predicted large concentrations than the upper tail of the gamma distribution weekly sampling for two years in urban catchments and for four years in agricultural catchments generated reasonable estimates of the average raw water e coli concentrations the proposed methodology can be easily used to inform the development of sampling strategies and statistical indices to set site specific treatment requirements graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water escherichia coli hydrometeorology exposure assessment quantitative microbial risk assessment event based sampling 1 introduction the world health organization s who water quality guidelines recommend a preventive and risk based approach for drinking water quality management for this purpose a spectrum of microbial risk assessment approaches is available from simple sanitary inspections and risk matrices to more complex ones such as quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra who 2016b the qmra approach can provide relative estimates of microbial risks at drinking water treatment plants dwtps which may be particularly useful to prioritize investments in improving water treatment or in implementing source water protection measures however in many situations data on pathogen occurrence and concentrations in raw water are not available at dwtps and only faecal indicator bacteria fib are measured to characterize source water quality therefore to support the implementation of a source to tap approach simplified classification methods known as bin classification were developed to determine minimum treatment requirements according to a specific level of fib concentrations in raw water different summary statistics e g mean concentration maximum concentration and sampling strategies e g weekly sampling monthly sampling event based sampling are specified in regulatory requirements worldwide for bin classification table a1 the arithmetic mean is a valid metric for characterizing microbial concentrations in order to characterize the risk of multiple exposures to low doses of pathogens haas 1996 the annual mean is usually considered in qmra because annual health based targets are recommended in guidelines and regulations sinclair et al 2015 precise estimation of the mean is challenging for surface water because microbial concentrations can vary over several orders of magnitude within hours or days burnet et al 2019a this metric relies on the law of large numbers as the sample size grows its sample mean gets closer to the true mean however the meaning of large depends on the distribution of the data the convergence is much faster for normal or thin tailed distribution than for heavy tailed distributions if the variance is very large any new observation can be large enough to overwhelm all previous observations regardless of the number of accumulated observations numerous studies have shown that heavy rainfall can rapidly increase microbial contamination loads in water atherholt et al 1998 burnet et al 2014 2019a kistemann et al 2002 signor et al 2005 in urban areas combined sewer overflow cso discharges induced by heavy rainfall or snowmelt events can cause recurring microbial peaks in raw water at dwtps jalliffier verne et al 2016 madoux humery et al 2016 in agricultural areas similar heavy rainfall episodes can increase microbial contamination of surface waters as a result of overland transport tile drainage systems and resuspension from stream sediments e g dorner et al 2006 a statistical approach was proposed to incorporate such peak events in the risk assessment for a hypothetical frequency of occurrence petterson et al 2006 however methods for the estimation of peak event frequency have not been proposed yet stochastic models are used in other fields to evaluate the frequency of extreme precipitation events katz et al 2002 streamflow peaks katz et al 2002 and extreme pollution from runoff harremoës 1988 these models have implications for quantifying the frequency of extreme events at dwtps but have not been utilized in the context of microbial safety of drinking water in quebec canada raw water e coli concentrations are measured since 2013 at least weekly for large dwtps 10 000 inhabitants these extensive datasets provide a unique opportunity to study temporal variations in different catchments the objective of the study was to first develop a methodology to correctly estimate the mean e coli concentrations in surface drinking water sources by considering peak events large routine monitoring datasets from six dwtps were fitted with parametric distributions having different upper tail behaviors for the best fit distributions we then evaluated the required minimum sample size to estimate the mean concentration for different ranges of uncertainty secondly key contributors to the mean concentration level were identified by examining the influence of seasonality and hydrometeorological factors on temporal variations finally we conducted event based sampling during two hydrometeorological events at an urban dwtp to evaluate whether the selected parametric distributions predicted these targeted peak events implications for the development of sampling strategies and probabilistic models are discussed for setting health based drinking water treatment requirements 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites six dwtps fed by rivers located in urban and agricultural catchments were selected and classified by the mean annual river flow rate in ascending order from a to d table 1 dwtp c2 is located downstream dwtp c1 wastewater treatment plants wwtps cso discharge points and the dominant land cover type were identified for areas 15 km upstream of the drinking water intakes in quebec csos are equipped with recording devices to measure the frequency and the daily cumulative duration of discharges gouvernement du québec 2015 cso discharges are forbidden during dry periods but are permitted with restrictions during rainfall and snowmelt episodes canadian council of ministers of the environment 2007 gouvernement du québec 2015 in agricultural areas manure must be spread on unfrozen soils between april and october gouvernement du québec 2018 2 2 hydrometeorological data the impact of hydrometeorology on the variations in raw water e coli concentrations at dwtp c1 were investigated to identify critical periods of contamination for event based sampling daily river flow rate snow cover and total precipitation were obtained from online databases river flow rate was measured at a provincial gauging station 5 km downstream of dwtp c1 the other parameters were obtained from the montreal pierre elliott trudeau international airport weather station environment and climate change canada 2018 located 17 km south of the dwtp 2 3 regulatory e coli monitoring escherichia coli was chosen as an indicator of microbial water quality because of its widespread use in drinking water regulations and because it provides evidence of recent faecal pollution who 2011 depending on the dwtp we obtained routine e coli monitoring results for five to nine years between 2009 and 2017 raw water samples were collected daily from monday to thursday daily m t or once a week between monday and thursday weekly all samples were collected during regular working hours from 9 00 to 18 00 e coli was enumerated with plate counts on ec mug medium american public health association 2005 by membrane filtration using modified membrane thermotolerant e coli agar modified mtec epa method 1603 or by the defined substrate technology using the idexx quanti tray 2000 system with colilert reagent american public health association 2005 e coli concentrations were reported either in most probable number mpn or colony forming unit cfu per 100 ml two ten fold serial dilutions 0 1 0 01 were carried out for the modified mtec method to obtain countable ranges of 20 80 cfus per plate and no dilution with countable ranges of 1 2419 mpn 100 ml was applied with colilert hence the upper limit of detection with this modified mtec and the colilert methods were 8000 cfu 100 ml and 2420 mpn 100 ml respectively non detect values were replaced with a limit of detection of 1 e coli 100 ml for statistical analyses this simple approach for handling non detects has a negligible impact on statistical inference because at these dwtps the proportions of non detects are small 5 poisson mixture distributions could be used to handle non detects in cases where their proportion would be higher burnet et al 2019b observed a strong correlation r 0 94 between membrane filtration and the colilert assay at dwtp c1 for ease of interpretation all e coli results were presented as e coli 100 ml 2 4 indices for the identification of heavy tails two simple measures were considered to evaluate the statistical dispersion of each empirical distribution of e coli concentrations the kurtosis was selected to evaluate if infrequent extreme deviations were captured in historical data a high kurtosis can indicate that tail events are not properly characterized and that the true mean could be higher than the sample mean the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean absolute deviation mad was further examined as it increases with the heavy tailedness of the distribution taleb 2015 2 5 statistical inference of e coli concentrations statistical inference was undertaken based on reported e coli concentrations to draw conclusions on the mean concentration and its uncertainty continuous distributions were selected to describe the variation in e coli concentrations without taking into account the random poisson distribution of counts because only data in the form of concentration measurements were available the variations in faecal indicator concentrations in water are often described using log normal distributions thomas 1955 ott 1994 here we evaluated how the gamma log normal and lomax distributions described the variations in raw water e coli concentrations at each dwtp those distributions were selected because they have different simple underlying generative processes frank 2014 and embrace a spectrum of tail behaviors haas 1997 the lomax distribution also known as pareto type ii has not previously been selected to describe the variability of microbial contamination in water but has many applications in natural sciences newman 2005 sornette 2006 this distribution can be interpreted as an exponential distribution with a power law tail the power law tail is characterized by a much slower decay as compared to an exponential distribution two different approaches were adopted for statistical inference first a bayesian approach was applied for the inference of the three candidate distributions distributions were parametrized by shape k and scale θ gamma mean μ and standard deviation σ log normal or shape α and scale λ lomax table 2 the parameters were provided with broad noncommittal prior distributions so that the prior had a minimal influence on the posterior kruschke et al 2014 a sample of posterior parameter pairs was constructed using a markov chain monte carlo procedure using gibbs sampling the models were specified and run in jags v4 2 0 plummer 2003 from r v3 4 1 r core team 2014 markov chain monte carlo methods were performed using rjags v4 6 plummer 2013 four markov chains were implemented for each parameter the model was run for 104 iterations after a burn in phase of 103 iterations the brooks gelman rubin scale reduction factor indicated that convergence was obtained for each of these four chains gelman and shirley 2011 the uncertainty on the parameter values of the bayesian models and the predicted mean concentration was then evaluated the goodness of fit of each bayesian model was measured with the deviance information criterion dic spiegelhalter et al 2002 as follows 1 d i c 2 l p where l is the log likelihood of the data given the posterior means of the parameters and p is an estimate of the effective number of the parameter in the model gelman et al 2013 a lower dic indicates a better model fit a second method was applied for statistical inference because bimodality was observed at dwtp b and only normal mixture models were available in jags maximum likelihood estimation was computed for a mixture of two gamma distributions and for a mixture of two log normal distributions via expectation maximization algorithms with the r package mixr yu 2018 the goodness of fit of these two distribution models was measured with the deviance the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic aic and bic also reward goodness of fit and includes a penalty that is a function of the number of estimated parameters the uncertainty on the parameter values of the mixture models and the predicted mean concentrations was not evaluated source codes are provided in the supplementary material section b 2 6 minimum sample size determination the minimum sample size required to accurately estimate the true mean of a log normal distribution for different confidence intervals was determined by iterations with the cox method olsson 2005 the confidence interval for a log normal distribution with a mean μ and the standard deviation σ is 2 μ σ 2 z σ 2 n σ 4 2 n 1 where the value of z to evaluate the 95 confidence interval is 1 96 and n is the sample size 2 7 identification of critical contamination periods lorenz curves cowell 2000 were used to summarize the quantile share information contained in empirical e coli distributions to produce these graphs e coli samples were ordered by their concentration starting with the lowest and then plotted against the cumulative proportion of the ordered samples running from zero to one along the horizontal axis ordinary lorenz curve values were multiplied by the mean concentration to evaluate the distributions of e coli concentrations in terms of long term mean concentrations this curve is known as a generalized lorenz curve shorrocks 1983 the generalized lorenz curves were computed with the r package ineq zeileis 2014 long term and seasonal variations were assessed the seasons were defined as winter dec feb spring mar may summer june aug and fall sept nov the short term variability in e coli concentrations was examined at dwtp c1 from january to april snowmelt period between 2013 and 2017 the observed variables were e coli concentrations the flow rate of the river the snow cover and the daily precipitation an online instrument measuring β d glucuronidase gluc activity coliminder vwm gmbh vienna austria was installed at the dwtp intake to characterize periods of high variability in microbial contamination during the 2017 snowmelt period the technology was used to track e coli at near real time frequency following field and laboratory validation completed by burnet et al 2019b detailed technical information about the technology can be found in koschelnik et al 2015 the instrument was installed at the intake of the dwtp in november 2016 and measured gluc activity every 2 h gluc activity measurements obtained during the first month after the installation allowed to differentiate baseline from peak levels of contamination during and following autumn and winter rainfall episodes during periods of high fluctuations of the gluc activity level we adjusted the measurements to hourly frequency based on the short term dynamics of the gluc activity two snowmelt events were identified grab samples were collected every three to 5 h for 20 h during a first gluc activity peak in february 2017 and for 60 h during a second gluc activity peak in april 2017 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics the sample mean of e coli concentrations in raw water varied between dwtps from 22 to 507 e coli 100 ml table 3 overall the mean and the mean absolute deviation mad decreased with the mean flow rate of the river a 0 2 log10 increase in the mean and mad was observed between dwtp c1 and c2 dwtps b c2 and e displayed the highest sd to mad ratio the kurtosis was greater than 155 at dwtps c2 and e but was only 25 at dwtp b indicating potential bimodality of the empirical distribution 3 2 distribution selection best fit parameters of the gamma lomax and log normal distributions at dwtps a and b predicted differences up to 0 5 log10 between the lowest estimated mean concentrations and the highest estimated mean concentrations table 4 for dwtps a and b the predicted means of the lomax distribution were higher than for the gamma and log normal distributions the uncertainty on the predicted mean of the lomax distribution was not stable at dwtps a and b since the mean concentration was not defined when the value of the shape parameter α was less than 1 0 the tail had infinite area the differences among the predicted mean of the three models at dwtps c1 c2 d and e was less than 0 1 log10 the influence of the behavior of the tail of a distribution on the predicted mean is discussed in section 4 1 to define what is an important difference in dic for the selection of a model spiegelhalter et al 2002 suggested to apply the same rules of thumb as was proposed by burnham and anderson 2004 for the akaike information criterion aic differences in aic within 1 2 of the best model minimum aic value deserve consideration and differences within 3 7 have considerably less support therefore the log normal or the lomax distribution better fitted the observed data than the gamma distribution at all dwtps table 4 at dwtp b the difference in dic was small between the log normal distribution and the lomax distribution gamma mixture and lognormal mixture distributions were also considered for dwtp b table 5 the deviance of the mixture of two log normal distributions was much lower than the deviance of the lomax distribution deviance of 3057 with the mixture models a distribution was fitted to the tail of the observations at a probability of exceedance of 14 for the gamma model and 6 for the log normal model the difference between the sample mean and the combined predicted mean of the mixture models was lower than 0 1 log10 3 3 posterior predictive checks cumulative distribution function cdf and complementary cdf ccdf plots were produced to illustrate the fit of the gamma log normal and lomax distributions to routine monitoring data overall the gamma distribution accurately estimated the sample mean table 4 but overestimated low concentrations fig 1 and underestimated large concentrations fig 2 the power law tail of the lomax distribution predicted higher concentrations than the tail of the log normal distribution when the value of the scale parameter λ was lower than the sample mean at dwtp e the dic of the lomax distribution was higher than the dic of the log normal distribution even if the lomax distribution was a better fit for the tail events the bulk of the distribution where most of the samples were located was therefore log normally distributed but not the tail fig 3 shows that the mixture of two log normal distributions provided a better fit to the empirical tail than the unimodal distributions at dwtp b the log normal distribution fit on the highest values only describes the variability of around 5 of the data suggesting that specific conditions such as hydrometeorological events could generate a different probability pattern than baseline conditions in this agricultural catchment 3 4 sample size determination the value of the parameter sigma of the log normal distribution had an important influence on the minimum sample size at dwtps a c1 c2 and d table 6 a sigma increase of 0 4 doubled the minimum sample size from dwtp d to dwtp a for all dwtps a three fold increase in minimum sample size was required to reduce the range of the confidence interval from 0 5 log10 to 0 3 log10 a ten fold increase was needed to reduce that range from 0 3 log10 to 0 1 log10 3 5 seasonal variations of e coli concentrations the generalized lorenz curves show that a small proportion of samples contributes highly to the long term mean fig 4 in each graph the black diagonal line represents perfect equality where each sample would have the same contribution to the mean concentration therefore the more the empirical curve deviates from the diagonal the more the tail of the distribution contributes to the mean for example at dwtp b the long term mean illustrated with the black curve breaks at a mean concentration of approximately 100 e coli 100 ml the bimodality of the empirical distribution causes that break from this point around 10 of the total number of samples also 10 of the total period at the dwtp increases the long term mean from 100 e coli 100 ml to 387 e coli 100 ml an increase of 0 6 log10 these curves can also describe the seasonality of the contamination seasonal and annual means are illustrated by the maximum value of their generalized lorenz curve a seasonal distribution has more influence on the annual mean when the maximum value of a seasonal curve is higher than the maximum value of the annual curve thus the annual mean was mostly influenced by summer and fall conditions in the agricultural catchments dwtps a b and by winter or spring conditions in the urban catchments dwtps c1 c2 e smaller differences between seasons were observed at dwtp d 3 6 short term variations of e coli concentrations time series analysis of hydrometeorological factors and raw water e coli concentrations were used to identify periods of high contamination at dwtp c1 from january 2013 to april 2016 fig 5 peak concentrations over 1000 e coli 100 ml were frequently detected during the snowmelt period usually occurring from march to april however these peak events were not always detected during the rapid decline of the snow cover e g march april 2013 in 2016 precipitation in winter was dominated by rainfall rather than snow and no peaks were observed these different hydrometeorological conditions had a noticeable impact on the annual distribution of e coli concentrations at dwtp c1 the annual mean was 341 e coli 100 ml for 2014 and 146 e coli 100 ml for 2016 a difference of 0 4 log10 in 2017 event based sampling revealed the influence of hydrometeorological factors on the short term dynamics of e coli concentrations fig 6 for the february event e coli concentrations varied from 161 to 2247 e coli 100 ml within 7 h and reached a maximum concentration of 2420 e coli 100 ml concentrations higher than 1000 e coli 100 ml were observed for 21 h no routine samples were collected because the event happened over the weekend the april peak occurred during the week and was also sampled during routine monitoring e coli concentrations varied from 440 to 3684 e coli 100 ml and concentrations higher than 1000 e coli 100 ml were observed for 66 h the maximum daily mean concentrations during the february and april peaks were 1588 e coli 100 ml and 2567 e coli 100 ml respectively both daily mean concentrations were higher than the 97th percentile 8 years of data of daily m t sampling the maximum concentrations sampled during the april peak was higher than the maximum concentration sampled in 8 years of routine monitoring data maximum daily mean concentrations from event based sampling are represented with vertical lines on the ccdf plot fig 7 both lines crossed the tails of the modeled distributions thus tail events were captured with the event based sampling strategy the probability of occurrence of the event was back calculated for each distribution the gamma distribution did not predict the maximum daily mean during the april peak the log normal distribution predicted a frequency of occurrence of these daily peaks between two to twenty days per year the lomax distribution predicted these events at a lower frequency varying between two days a year and one day every five years 4 discussion 4 1 optimizing distribution selection to describe e coli variations in source water candidate parametric distributions were selected to fit raw water e coli measurements the following underlying generative processes of distributions were considered for the selection the combination of small scale processes at a higher aggregate scale tends to yield a common probability distribution consistent with given constraints that maximize the entropy frank 2009 a maximization of entropy with a constraint on the arithmetic mean results in an exponential distribution if the constraint is on the mean logarithm then observations follow a power law distribution the scaling often changes between linear and logarithmic as magnitude changes the gamma distribution is a product of a power law x k 1 and an exponential function e x θ table 2 at small magnitudes the scaling is logarithmic because the power law component dominates and at large magnitudes the scaling is linear because the exponential function dominates the value of k 1 θ determines the magnitude at which those scales dominate thus only the linear scaling of the gamma distribution dominated at all dwtps because k was less than 1 0 table 3 the lomax distribution has the inverse scale a linear log scaling thus it can be understood as an exponential distribution with a power law tail the scale parameter λ indicates the level at which the distribution changes from a linear scaling to a logarithmic scaling this parameter can be viewed as a power law tail threshold therefore the logarithm scaling starts at a concentration below the sample mean at dwtps a b and e and above the sample mean at dwtps c1 c2 d table 3 a disadvantage of the lomax distribution is that the predicted mean is not finite when the value of the shape parameter α is below 1 0 truncated lévy distributions can be considered in these cases mantegna and stanley 1995 koponen 1995 mariani and liu 2007 these distributions still have a power law form but with infinite tail truncated or exponential cut offs the log normal distribution follows a gaussian distribution on the log scale therefore the information dissipates on the additive log scale and the generative process is multiplicative at all dwtps the tail of the log normal and the lomax distributions predicted the observed concentrations better than the tail of the gamma distribution fig 2 log normal and power law distributions have similar multiplicative processes the argument as to whether one is more accurate than the other has arisen across a variety of fields mitzenmacher 2004 under general conditions the power law tail can be obtained with the inclusion of an additive term to the basic multiplicative process this additive term is added only when the system crosses a lower threshold acting as a barrier preventing collapse to zero sornette and cont 1997 hence hydrometeorological events could be generating this lower threshold and produce power law behavior in the distributions as it was observed at dwtp e the kurtosis and the sd to mad ratio are proposed as indices to identify the behavior of the tail of the distribution the log normal distribution produced only a conservative bound for tail observations when the sd to mad ratio was less than 2 0 dwtps a c1 d at a higher ratio dwtps b c2 e the log normal distributions could not conservatively estimate all observations fig 2 however the sample kurtosis was much smaller at dwtp b than at dwtps c2 and e table 3 at dwtp b the measure of the deviance table 5 and the posterior predictive check fig 3 indicated that the mixture of two log normal distributions better fitted e coli concentrations than the lomax distribution the hypothesis of a bimodal behavior in the distribution of environmental contaminants was previously suggested pollard et al 2002 the evaluation of a bimodal behavior at dwtp b was necessary because the lomax distribution predicted a much higher mean concentration than the sample mean dwtps c2 and e had sample kurtosis greater than 155 the power law tail of the lomax distribution predicted observed data at dwtp e the value of the shape parameter α of 1 7 was large enough to calculate a finite credible interval on the mean table 3 at dwtp c2 only one sample with a concentration of 11 000 e coli 100 ml increased the sd to mad ratio from 1 80 to 2 46 and the kurtosis from 40 to 155 differences between the sample and predicted mean of the best fit model were lower than 0 1 log10 at all dwtps therefore the sample mean was a reliable index to estimate the true mean raw water e coli concentration at these dwtps in other words the evaluated sample sizes were large enough to converge to the true mean of the log normal distribution dwtps a c1 c2 d the mixture of two log normal distributions dwtp b and the lomax distribution dwtp e however it is possible that actual peak concentrations may be underestimated because of upper limit of detection in this dataset this was the case for 3 245 samples reaching the upper limits of detection of 8000 cfu 100 ml at dwtp b and 4 1584 samples reaching 2419 mpn 100 ml at dwtp c1 this could underestimate the size of the upper tail hence the number of dilutions should always be carefully selected to avoid dealing with an upper limit of detection when data are collected for statistical inference 4 2 evaluation of the sample size to estimate mean of e coli concentrations at dwtp intakes required confidence or credible intervals on mean estimates are usually not indicated in guidelines and regulations table a1 the estimates of the mean concentrations are used to determine minimum treatment targets usually quantified in log10 reduction values a large uncertainty on the mean will increase the probability of misclassification of a treatment bin category health based targets will not be met if treatment requirements are underestimated while unnecessary costly treatment processes will be added if treatment requirements are overestimated to reduce the uncertainty to an appropriate level we are proposing the use of the cox method to determine the minimum sample size when the best fit distribution is log normal weekly sampling for two years n 104 allowed the estimation of the true mean with a 95 confidence interval of 0 3 log10 at dwtps c1 c2 and d table 6 four years of weekly sampling n 208 would be required at dwtp a to reach 0 3 log10 these sample sizes should be doubled to reduce the uncertainty to 0 2 log10 therefore the lowest 95 confidence interval achievable with a reasonable number of samples would be 0 3 log10 these results are site specific because they depend on the variance of the dataset a conservative value of the variance could be assumed to determine the minimum sample size for a group of dwtps other mathematical approaches should be considered to estimate the minimum sample size when observations follow lomax or mixture distributions in these cases the required minimum sample sizes to estimate the true mean with a 95 confidence interval could be higher than those determined for the log normal distributions an estimation of the mean concentration with results from weekly sampling strategies for 1 year as regulated in quebec for large dwtps n 52 samples was sufficient to reach a confidence interval of around 0 4 log10 in urban rivers dwtps c1 c2 d but not in the studied agricultural river dwtp a where the confidence interval was larger than 0 5 log10 monthly sampling for two years n 24 samples as required by the us epa in rivers where the arithmetic mean is lower than 50 e coli 100 ml would only predict the mean with a confidence interval lower than 0 5 log10 if the variance is small value of the sigma parameter lower than 1 1 which is lower than observed at the sites in this study the variance of the e coli concentrations was higher for dwtps fed by the small rivers dwtps a and b that are more subject to episodic changes in water quality therefore robust methods for the design of sampling strategies should consider water quality variability particularly in small agricultural catchments 4 3 integrating peak microbial contamination events accounting for hydrometeorological events is an important issue for the quantification of microbial treatment requirements petterson et al 2015 peak events need to be considered as they represent challenging periods for dwtps as illustrated by major waterborne outbreaks in the past e g curriero et al 2001 hrudey et al 2002 thomas et al 2006 the collection of event based samples in addition to routine monitoring has been proposed in who guidance documents who 2016a who 2016b who 2017 in the netherlands incidental samples must be collected when peak concentrations in pathogen counts are assumed to occur vrom inspectorate 2005 as demonstrated in this study new statistical approaches are needed to incorporate this information into risk assessment routine samples are quasi independent and identically distributed i i d random variables this property implies that a given sample is independent of the previously collected sample alternatively event based samples are not i i d random variables and cannot be combined with routine samples for statistical inference however event based samples can be used to 1 evaluate short term exposure e g maximum daily risk and 2 evaluate if peak concentrations are included or excluded from the tail of a parametric distribution inferred with routine monitoring data short term variations of e coli were measured at dwtp c1 during and following two hydrometeorological events during the snowmelt period in 2017 instead of relying on precipitation data we used a microbial surrogate to time our event based sampling online measurement of gluc activity can be used as a reliable surrogate to identify periods of high e coli concentrations burnet et al 2019a b for the collection of samples the maximum daily mean concentrations of 1588 e coli 100 ml in february and 2567 e coli 100 ml in april were higher than the 97th percentile and the 99th percentile retrieved from eight years of daily m t monday to thursday sampling respectively concentrations exceeding 1000 e coli 100 ml were continuously measured for about one day in february and during three days in april as such we demonstrated that online gluc activity measurement based sampling strategy is suitable for the detection of critical periods of e coli contamination in an urban river during the snowmelt period this sampling strategy could be applied to target pathogen monitoring programs or study variations of pathogen concentrations in source water during hydrometeorological events the ccdf plot for dwtp c1 showed that the gamma distribution could not predict the maximum daily mean concentrations during the april event fig 7 the maximum daily mean concentrations of these two events crossed the ccdf curves of the log normal and the lomax distributions the log normal distribution predicted a frequency of occurrence of these daily peaks between two to twenty days per year therefore the log normal distribution was a conservative bound for peak events if these maximum daily mean concentrations occurred less than 20 days a year in this case weekly sampling for two years estimated the true mean with a confidence interval of 0 3 log10 table 6 and included the influence of these peak events 4 4 identifying key contributors to peak events in agricultural and urban rivers the protection of drinking water sources is a preventive approach to minimize the influence of peak events on the mean concentration and thereby ensure adequate health based treatment requirements we introduced generalized lorenz curves as quantitative tools to determine how critical contamination periods influence the long term mean e coli concentrations for four dwtps the identification of these periods could guide the implementation of source water protection measures the combined annual generalized lorenz curves indicated that peak events had more influence on the mean concentration in small agricultural rivers dwtps a and b than in large urban rivers dwtps c1 c2 d fig 4 seasonal contributions to the long term mean e coli concentrations were different between urban and agricultural catchments for agricultural rivers the long term mean was driven by samples collected during summer and fall the conditions leading to the bimodal behavior of the distribution at dwtp b should be further investigated with hydrometeorological and land use data to identify potential factors triggering a different generative process for the distribution of tail events two primary sources of contamination could contribute to the observed pattern since four csos and one wwtp are located upstream of the dwtp during rainfall the combined effect of these two sources could generate a different distribution in the urban rivers critical periods of contamination at dwtps were winter and spring at dwtp c1 rapid snowmelt had more influence than rainfall on the variation of e coli concentrations and recurrent peak events were observed at low flow rates in 2014 and 2015 fig 5 at dwtp c1 and c2 treated effluent discharges but also sewage by passes at wwtps and cso discharges during snowmelt periods likely influence the behavior of the tail of the distribution burnet et al 2019a at dwtp d madoux humery et al 2016 showed that approximately 80 of e coli peak concentrations were linked to cso discharges caused by daily precipitation exceeding 10 mm or by spring snowmelt here we show that these peaks could be predicted by a log normal distribution fig 2 and that weekly sampling for two years n 104 samples at the dwtp enables to estimate the true mean concentration with a confidence interval of 0 3 log10 table 6 5 conclusions we have shown that it is possible to use simple parametric models and graphical tools to consider different tail behaviors for the evaluation of the mean e coli concentration in raw water the application of this approach to large data sets collected with routine and event based monitoring strategies at six drinking water treatment plants located in different types of catchments demonstrated that weekly sampling for two years in urban catchments and for four years in agricultural catchments produce reasonable estimates of the average raw water e coli concentrations and encompass peak event concentrations log normal lomax and a mixture of log normal distributions could best predict high e coli concentrations in raw water the kurtosis and the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean absolute deviation mad are useful indices for identifying sites vulnerable to peak e coli concentrations the log normal distribution fitted on extensive weekly monitoring data conservatively predicted peak e coli concentrations as measured during two snowmelt events at a drinking water treatment plant under the influence of un treated sewage discharges although the log normal distribution appears to be the best default choice extending our findings should be done carefully considering the specificities of plausible but exceptional hydrometeorological and contamination events the generalized lorenz curves show that a small proportion of samples predominantly contributes to the average e coli concentrations in agricultural catchments critical seasons of high contamination levels were summer and fall in the agricultural catchment and winter and spring in urban catchments the characterization of site specific variations can promote the effective implementation of mitigation measures to address contamination sources with the highest influence on the average e coli concentrations at drinking water treatment plant intakes the data collection and model validation methods described in this paper could be adapted for pathogens to explicitly consider hydrometeorological events in the quantification of microbial treatment targets given the growing importance of considering peak events in setting treatment requirements additional studies confirming
