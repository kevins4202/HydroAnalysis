9895,a reliable prediction of net radiation rn inside naturally ventilated greenhouses is critical for accurate evapotranspiration evaluation and thus for water saving considering that previous studies have indicated that evapotranspiration in such relatively decoupled greenhouses is predominantly controlled by greenhouse rn rn gh we hypothesized here that rn gh in naturally ventilated greenhouses can be accurately predicted using global solar radiation in the vicinity of the greenhouse rs out as the only measured parameter together with the calculated position of the sun defined by the solar elevation angle and solar azimuth to test this hypothesis we performed experiments in two adjacent greenhouses in the southern negev israel 30 96 n 34 69 e under arid climate in one of the greenhouses tomato was grown during winter 2017 2018 while in the other melon was grown during winter and spring 2018 2019 our analyses demonstrated that rn gh can be accurately predicted r2 0 982 using rs out as the only measured parameter while the global solar radiation inside the greenhouse rs gh and the ratio between rn gh and rs gh are predominantly dependent on solar elevation angle and solar azimuth as well as the greenhouse structure and cloud cover this paper shows that the impact of these properties on the association between rs out and rn gh can be accurately resolved using multivariate regression by the k nearest neighbors approach this suggests that computerized modeling of the greenhouse structure and light transmission can potentially enable precise evaluation of rn gh and therefore also reference evapotranspiration in naturally ventilated greenhouses using rs out as the only measured parameter a calculation based factor for the cloud effect on rs out

souza et al 2002 tüzel and leonardi 2009 it is estimated that today about 405 000 ha are cultivated under permanent structures fao 2013 greenhouse production systems can decrease crop water requirements by as much as 20 40 compared to open field cultivation however greenhouse growers usually apply more irrigation than the actual water consumption kitta et al 2015 levidow et al 2014 because in greenhouses our ability to precisely predict water consumption is greatly reduced compared to the open field with the vast expansion of greenhouse cultivation the need for proper irrigation management is essential irrigation practices in greenhouses are generally based on the grower s personal perspective i e irrigation is applied without monitoring the soil climate or plant water status bonachela et al 2006 the difficulty in predicting plant water consumption in greenhouses has led to the development of various approaches to determine the crop water requirements inside these structures these approaches range from adaptation to greenhouse conditions of the well established method using crop coefficient for reference et predication as proposed by fao 56 to computational fluid dynamics modelling of evapotranspiration using radiative and convective fluxes boulard and wang 2002 fernández et al 2010 gavilán et al 2015 gavilán and castillo llanque 2009 ilahi 2009 lozano et al 2017 evapotranspiration et and reference evapotranspiration eto can be measured or estimated by direct or indirect methods among the most common direct methods to estimate et from measurements are with weighing lysimeters or water balance allen et al 2011 baille et al 1992 indirect methods such as the penman monteith pm equation or the pm equation formulated according the food and agriculture organization fao 56 are frequently and successfully used to evaluate eto in the open field allen et al 1998 using nearby meteorological stations that provide the meteorological parameters required as input the pm equation has been shown to adequately predict et in greenhouses as well for instance several researchers found the pm equation to be very reliable in greenhouses for use in accurately estimating the et rates of tomato and lettuce boulard et al 1997 pollet et al 2000 the pm equation gave the best results for eto estimation in plastic greenhouses in spain fernández et al 2010 however the pm and other indirect meteorological based methods are less frequently used in greenhouses mainly because specific measurements are needed for each individual greenhouse to evaluate the net radiation rn external air temperature tair water vapor pressure deficit and wind speed ws in addition growers usually do not have the necessary knowledge and or sensors to operate this system or make the necessary calculations magliulo et al 2003 therefore today most irrigation controllers of high tech greenhouses make use of a simple linear equation with daily or weekly calibration using a lysimeter to correlate the external global solar radiation rs out with et even though this method is successfully used in many greenhouses it has great drawbacks because it requires a drain collection system for calibration which is costly and therefore not common that is limited to cultivation in pots katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 one simplification for greenhouses may arise from the fact that in naturally ventilated greenhouses the aerodynamic component of transpiration is significantly reduced due to the low ws and the crop is effectively decoupled from the greenhouse air katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 under these conditions et is mainly controlled by the radiation balance doorenbos and pruitt 1977 fernández et al 2010 katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 priestley and taylor 1972 this is especially true for greenhouses with insect nets and those with no roof opening both common in mediterranean semiarid and arid climates möller et al 2004 pardossi et al 2004 previous studies have indicated that in such greenhouses eto can be predicted fairly well by rn or global solar radiation alone by applying a fixed value for ws and the aerodynamic component gavilán et al 2015 katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 liu et al 2008 teitel et al 2008 valdés gómez et al 2009 valdés et al 2004 this means that prediction of rn or global solar radiation inside the greenhouse rs gh could provide a reliable method to predict eto inside naturally ventilated greenhouses however previous research has shown that rs gh distribution is itself heterogeneous boulard and wang 2002 wang and boulard 2000 which makes direct measurement of rs gh highly complex and costly considering that it should rely on multiple sensors to obtain a good representation of rs gh spatial and temporal distribution alternatively prediction of rs gh does not necessarily need to rely on radiation measurements inside the greenhouse potentially it can be evaluated using rs out the sun s location the optical characteristics of the greenhouse cover the greenhouse structure its orientation relative to the north and the direct to diffuse radiation ratio abood 2015 baeza and lópez 2012 baxevanou et al 2008 rosa 1988 wang and boulard 2000 a survey of rn prediction methods shows that the many proposed formulae can be summarized as two fundamental methods the first relies merely on tair brutsaert 1975 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 weiss 1982 wright and jensen 1972 while the second involves air canopy and soil surface temperatures bisht et al 2005 cui et al 2010 hemmati et al 2012 ortega farias et al 2000 saito et al 2006 the latter group complicates current methods of rn prediction due to the need for air crop and or soil temperature and reduces the likelihood of these methods being adequate for widescale use in commercial greenhouses especially low tech ones in addition complex equations were presented to determine transmissivity based on the angle of incidence of solar radiation boulard and wang 2000 our hypothesis was that the geometry of a greenhouse structure and cover together with solar elevation angle αs and solar azimuth φs can be used to predict rn gh inside the greenhouse which can then be used as a basis for adequate eto gh with rs out as the only measured parameter relying on recent advances in numerical simulations and machine learning this simplification can overcome the challenges associated with measurement of micrometeorological parameters inside the greenhouse as well as use of complex greenhouse transmissivity τ equations such computer simulation based prediction of τ to evaluate rs gh or rn inside the greenhouse rn gh can be followed by solving radiation based eto equations boulard and wang 2002 fernández et al 2010 wang and boulard 2000 prediction of τ and rs gh distribution for a greenhouse by computer models has already proven to be feasible and accurate baxevanou et al 2008 papadakis et al 1998 wang and boulard 2000 however rn gh rather than rs gh is the mechanistic determinant of eto gh and therefore most eto gh prediction models are based on the former our hypothesis driven objective was to test whether a machine learning approach specifically the k nearest neighbors knn can be accurately and efficiently used for τ rn gh and consequently eto gh prediction based on rs out as the only measured parameter a special focus was given to verify whether such approach could be adapted to any greenhouse for which et is predominantly dictated by the radiation balance such as in naturally ventilated greenhouses to achieve this meteorological parameters were measured inside and near two adjacent greenhouses in the winter and spring cultivation seasons over two consecutive years 2 materials and methods for our study a naturally ventilated greenhouse gh ii and a semi closed greenhouse gh i were used over the winter spring growing season in two consecutive years located in the southern negev israel 30 96o n 34 69o e with arid climate and loess soil type tomato was grown from december 2017 to february 2018 season i gh i totaling 55 days and melon was grown from december 2018 to may 2019 season ii gh ii totaling 157 days both crops in both seasons were trellised to 3 5 m height plants were irrigated three times a day using a drip irrigation system the irrigation amount was 6 mm per day in december and 5 mm per day from january until the end of the season divided into three equal openings per day according to standard agricultural practice in the area the greenhouses were arched multispan structures with side openings only covered with a 50 mesh net with an area of 1000 m2 and positioned one in front of the other fig 1 the greenhouses were composed of 4 spans of 8 m 32 m wide and 31 m long in total gutter was 4 m high and positioned along the n s axis the melon greenhouse gh ii was always open with no active ventilation system fig 1a thus the microclimate conditions followed the outside conditions through natural ventilation the tomato greenhouse gh i was closed during the day and the side walls were automatically opened to 2 m height if one or more of the following conditions was fulfilled greenhouse relative humidity rhgh 70 and air temperature tair gh 30 c the greenhouse was closed by the use of sidewall polyethylene curtains fig 1b and c the greenhouse was opened 30 min before sunset and closed again 30 min before sunrise an air circulation system was implemented in this greenhouse by use of a set of four air circulating fans installed at the end walls of the greenhouse at 4 m height which worked from 0800 h to 1600 h the analyses described throughout the paper followed data filtration to include only αs 5o to represent daytime data only 2 1 meteorological monitoring meteorological variables including tair gh ws rs gh rn gh and rhgh were measured at the center of each greenhouse at 2 m height until february when the plants reached 2 m in

algorithms for pattern classification and regression models knn was proposed in 1951 by fix and hodges 1951 and then modified by cover and hart 1967 knn has been identified as one of the top 10 influential methods in data mining wu et al 2008 consequently knn has been studied over the past few decades and widely applied in many fields bhatia and vandana 2010 and for many pattern classification problems such as pattern recognition xu and wu 2008 forestry chirici et al 2016 precision agriculture boubin et al 2019 ranking models geng et al 2008 object recognition bajramovic et al 2006 and event recognition yang et al 2000 applications knn techniques are a class of multivariate nonparametric approaches used for continuous or categorical prediction an important characteristic of the knn algorithm is that it is sensitive to the local structure of the data the algorithm used for the regression applied in this study included the following steps 1 compute the euclidean or maha distance from each of the query dependent points to the independent points 2 rank the distance of any data from each of the independent dataset values 3 find a heuristically optimal number k of nearest neighbors based on rmse this is done by cross validation using the actual observations 4 calculate an inverse distance weighted average of the dependent variable based on k nearest multivariate dependent neighbors the main difference between knn and a standard multivariable regression lies in the fact that the former does not assume a constant linear correlation between the variables rather it adjusts the correlations depending on each independent neighboring value and so can build a more complex regression pattern than a simple multivariate linear regression in this study we used the default knn model in the jmp statistical package 2 3 evapotranspiration models there are many models to predict and estimate et in this research we choose the pm model monteith 1965 penman 1948 as it has been recognized as a reliable method for eto prediction in greenhouses see section 1 it was used here as a reference to evaluate the eto prediction due to the complexity of the pm model and the fact that it is difficult to apply to greenhouses see section 1 we tested the performance of a different model in predicting eto in the greenhouses section 2 3 2 and compared to the eto predicted by the pm model 2 3 1 fao56 pm model the pm model monteith 1965 penman 1956 is aimed at a precise evaluation of et by reflecting the mechanistic effects of all of the basic meteorological parameters impacting this process this model further accounts for the properties of the canopy and soil regulating the response to the meteorological properties on et the fao56 pm equation is a simplified adaptation which refers to a grass reference crop et mm day 1 and is given by 6 et o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa es ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 g was estimated as 10 of rn during the daytime and 50 during nighttime as suggested by allen 1998 based on a 10 year study in naturally ventilated greenhouses in a mediterranean climate fernández et al 2010 suggested that a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 can be used under the studied conditions along with a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 as suggested by fao 56 according to the relation between aerodynamic resistance and wind speed suggested by allen 1998 for grass reference et aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 is equal to a fixed wind speed of 0 7 m s however we believe that more research is also needed to properly determine whether surface resistance of 70 s m 1 is accurate enough for greenhouses and so in this paper measured wind speed was used 2 3 2 radiation based method calibrated for spanish greenhouses this algorithm referred to as the spanish model which is based on eqs 7 and 8 was derived from 20 years of daily eto values calculated according to the fao 56 model and verified using a lysimeter 1983 2002 bonachela et al 2006 fernández et al 2010 orgaz et al 2005 7 for julian days jd 220 et 0 0 288 0 0019 jd g 0 τ 8 for julian days jd 220 et 0 1 339 0 00288 jd g 0 τ where τ is the greenhouse transmissivity the ratio between the inside and outside solar radiation g0 is the daily solar radiation outside the greenhouse mm day 1 2 4 geometrical optics model here a model termed the geometrical optics model gom fig 2 is introduced this model allows the prediction of τ the ratio between rn gh and rs gh rn ratio rs gh rn gh and eto gh using only measured rs out the calculated αs and φs roche 2011 and the multivariate regression using knn in multiple steps as follows 1 τ prediction using αs and φs for clear sky conditions only τcs 2 τ prediction for all conditions using τcs and a cloud factor cf the cf was defined as 9 cf 1 r s o u t r s o 100 clear sky was defined as cf 10 where rso is the clear sky solar radiation outside the greenhouse calculated as described by allen et al 1998 3 rs gh evaluation by the product of τ and rs out 4 rn ratio prediction using αs and φs 5 rn gh evaluation using the predicted rn ratio and predicted rs gh 6 eto gh prediction using various equations with the predicted rn gh and rs gh see fig 2 for the modeling scheme 3 results and discussion 3 1 τ prediction the prediction of τ based on rs out as performed by the gom requires a proper understanding of τ fig 3 presents a histogram of gh ii τ showing that this value is not constant variations can result from diffusion of the solar radiation e g by clouds and aerosols the irradiance contact angle with respect to the greenhouse cover as well as the greenhouse structure which can further affect the radiation fate following its entrance into the greenhouse it is clear from fig 3 that the τ prediction will require a more sophisticated approach than simply assuming a fixed number particularly when considering multispan greenhouses in contrast to what is frequently suggested for simpler structures fernández et al 2010 gavilán et al 2015 to study the effect of different factors on τ fig 4 presents the hourly correlation of ghtr with αs φs rs out and cf fig 4a d respectively assuming constant cover characteristics during this time frame the hourly ghtr is expected to predominantly be determined by the greenhouse structure the sun s location and clouds and aerosols nevertheless it is clear from fig 4a d that none of the parameters taken individually show a clear correlation with τ however higher r2 for the linear and knn based regression of τ with both αs and φs under clear sky conditions than the r2 for the regression of τ with each of the two latter parameters alone reflects a strong simultaneous dependence of τ on αs and φs fig 4e g the correlation of hourly τ with both αs and φs was best captured by knn r2 0 907 mae 0 016 re 0 0006 as can be seen in fig 4g for clear sky periods the fact that the knn based regression resulted in a significantly higher coefficient of determination than the linear regressions r2 0 407 fig 4e may result from the fact that knn takes into account second order dependence of the effect of the independent parameters on rs under varying conditions see section 2 2 1 the fact that τ is a function of both αs and φs rather than of each of these variables alone is mainly because the incident angle on the greenhouse cover is a significant determinant of the light transmittance which further depends on the tilt of the cover with respect to the ground and the structural properties of the greenhouse abood 2015 gupta et al 2012 wang and boulard 2000 note that in our study the impact of the structure on τ is further complicated by the structure s roof which was arched and multispan these greenhouse structural parameters affect τ simultaneously and in a complex manner note that the frame of the greenhouse causes shading and so the overall rs gh is a function of the 3d incident angle at a particular time the structure of the greenhouse and the location of the specific measurement inside the greenhouse in addition to the complex manner in which the geometric structure impacts rs gh both clouds and aerosols affect rs out and rs gh via radiation scatter and absorption as they increase the diffuse fraction of rs out wang and boulard 2000 and change the incident radiation angle dispersion and reflection michelangeli et al 1992 these effects in turn impact τ hence an adequate prediction of τ should rely on a multivariable regression which is specific to the structure type and orientation location on the globe hour of the day and cloud conditions in our case we test the hypothesis that machine learning algorithms such as knn can be advantageous in simplifying such complex phenomena the effect of clouds on our prediction is reflected by the significantly better prediction of τ for clear sky conditions fig 4e f vs all data fig 4g i note that the knn significantly improved the regression results for the latter dataset as well by comparing figs 4h and 4i r2 0 536 and r2 0 634 respectively it appears that the cf reduced the noise created by the clouds even though the r2 of the resulting τ was only 0 634 fig 4i rs gh predicted by the gom based on the measured rs out resulted in an accurate prediction r2 0 979 mae 13 831 re 0 923 fig 4l even for all of the data which included non clear sky conditions this is because the correlation between rs gh and rs out was initially good r2 0 910 and the gom application improved it there are other approaches to account for the cloud effects such as estimating or measuring the diffused part of rs out and using that as input in a prediction model rosa 1988 wang and boulard 2000 however measurement of the diffused fraction requires expensive instrumentation the estimation is complicated and from the results of our study our approach of using the cf seems to be satisfactory for agricultural use 3 2 rn gh prediction rn gh is key to the eto gh evaluation fig 5 focuses on the rn gh prediction by the gom using αs φs cf and rs gh as described in section 2 4 the figure demonstrates that rn ratio mainly depends on both φs and αs and is also affected by cloud cover for instance the rn ratio is highest at midday when the sun is at around 180 190 φs fig 5b and it generally increases with αs fig 5a and decreases with cloud cover fig 5c overall rn ratio can be well predicted based on only αs and φs by applying knn r2 0 88 re 0 001 mae 0 063 fig 5d whereas the results improved when adding the cf r2 0 923 re 0 004 mae 0 047 fig 5e it seems even that rn ratio is less affected by clouds and is more accurately predicted than τ as it had a higher r2 0 923 vs 0 634 of the τ prediction as with τ the dependence of rn ratio on αs and φs is complex and strongly depends on the greenhouse structure because by definition rn gh is the difference between incoming and outgoing radiation anderson and french 2019 it is also controlled by the temperature emittance coefficient and albedo of the crop and soil which determine the outgoing radiation in greenhouses rn evaluation is complicated by additional factors such as the greenhouse cover and structure which cause internal refraction critten 1983 and affect both incoming and outgoing radiation to our knowledge this is the first time that a prediction of rn ratio has been shown to be possible with geometric variables alone meaning that rn gh can be predicted using only rs out αs φs the greenhouse structure and cover properties while rn gh is very strongly correlated to measured rs gh r2 0 913 the regression between the two resulted in a deviation from 1 1 fig 5f using φs αs and cf together with the measured rs gh improved the prediction of rn gh r2 0 989 mae 9 497 re 0 005 fig 5g fig 5h demonstrates that even when using the rs gh predicted by gom the model still predicts rn gh to a high level of precision r2 0 955 mae 12 661 re 0 004 eq 10 is the knn model for predicting rn ratio using φs αs and the cloud factor for the particular experiment of season ii under these specific conditions the optimal k number of nearest neighbors to be considers was 6 in case αs φs or cf are missing then the average value over the whole period can be used as indicated by 37 763 179 994 and 0 225 respectively normalization is also critical as was indicated in section 2 3 2 all values must be normalized using their standard deviation for αs φs and cf which in our case was 16 635 56 673 and 0 245 respectively kdtable refers to a normalized euclidean distance lookup table for αs φs and cf with 1525 being the number of hourly measurements used to build the model it is important to note that this is an empirical equation which is valid for our particular study and not necessarily represent well other conditions including a different measurement point in the same greenhouse or a different greenhouse structure the main interest of using a machine learning method such as knn is that there is no need to account for complex relationships between the parameters as the algorithm can learn them by itself moreover the strong yet complex relationship between rn ratio to αs φs and cf suggests that modeling of the relationship by accounting for the specific greenhouse geometric structure can use as an excellent solution for reliable prediction of greenhouse rn 10 mean 1525 1 asconstant kdtable 1525 3 k nearest rows 6 if ismissing solarangle 37 763 else solar angle 16 635 if ismissing solarazimuth 179 994

open field eto evaluation including the one formulated by fao 56 to derive rn from rs and rn evaluation using the temperature and radiation emittance as proposed by ortega farias et al 2000 the fao 56 method did not provide a good prediction of rn gh in our greenhouse experiment re 18 88 table 1 while the emittance based method requires hard to measure parameters such as crop canopy temperature and or soil temperature based on previous studies it was suggested to use tair gh instead of canopy temperature and indeed for some conditions this gives good results in greenhouses ortega farias et al 2000 valdés gómez et al 2009 however under the conditions studied here the method suggested by ortega farias et al 2000 provided poor results re 29 49 table 1 moreover under arid climate high transpiration rates can cause a large difference between tair gh and canopy temperature of up to 10 c fig s1 invalidating the assumption that canopy temperature can be substituted by tair gh hence the measured canopy temperature is required for rn gh prediction when using this method in arid climates our approach as part of the gom is based on using αs φs and rs out to predict the rn ratio rather than expensive and complicated measurements the underlying assumption in this approach is that τ and rn ratio can be well predicted based on the position of the sun relative to the specific point of interest in the greenhouse by accounting for the greenhouse structure and cover properties note however that each point in the greenhouse has a specific geometric signature that reflects the solar incident angle on the cover shading and internal reflection caused by the structure similarly this signature is different for greenhouses at different locations on the globe and for greenhouses with different structure moreover the same greenhouse structure will have a different signature depending on whether it is oriented along the south north or east west axis however knowing the greenhouse geometric structure and the optical properties of the cover the gom approach can potentially predict rs gh and therefore rn gh for each point of a greenhouse based only on rs out and calculated αs and φs previous research has proven the feasibility of this approach for predicting τ and therefore rs gh boulard and wang 2002 papadakis et al 1998 wang and boulard 2000 however it was not implemented or tested for rn ratio or rn gh while the present study suggests that also the former parameter can be adequately predicted using the gom approach more research on the yearly pattern of rn ratio in different areas of a greenhouse is required to better understand the association between rn ratio αs φs and greenhouse structure before a generic model can be established 3 3 gom validation the gom was validated against a different dataset from season i the validation process compared the values measured during season i with the values predicted by the gom gom predictions for season i were performed using the same equations developed by the gom for season ii eq 10 s1 and s2 and the meteorological parameters measured during season ii as input to the model see section 2 4 the data were collected in a nearby greenhouse with about the same structure and azimuth however the measurement point was in a different relative location in the two greenhouses the season i dataset included rn gh but not rs gh measurements so all validations were done with respect to rn gh and eto gh fig 7 presents the prediction of rn gh for season i using the gom developed in season ii we can see from fig 7a that the gom rn gh accuracy is reduced when applied for season i as it deviates quite significantly from the 1 1 line this is probably because the measurement point was in a different relative location in the greenhouse in season i and in season ii coupled with the heterogeneity in solar radiation however it can be seen that for a clear sky the r2 of the rn gh gom is still very high 0 921 suggesting that generally the performance of the gom is good at resolving the association between rs out and rn gh but that the prediction can be improved by calibration for each location in the greenhouse this is in line with previous research which indicated that the radiation distribution in a greenhouse is not homogeneous baxevanou et al 2008 boulard and wang 2002 papadakis et al 1998 wang and boulard 2000 yet the high r2 for the regression between measured and gom predicted rn gh supports the assumption that a proper model simulating the radiation for each point in the greenhouse can predict rn gh and eto gh to a high degree of accuracy in this research we show that such a prediction is possible for rn gh and not only for rs gh as previously proven gupta et al 2012 papadakis et al 1998 wang and boulard 2000 fig 6b shows a further reduction in gom accuracy re 35 58 when all data are included rather than just clear sky data with a reduction in r2 to 0 790 note that the significant impact of the cf results at least in part from the fact that season i represented the cloudiest time of the year 3 4 eto evaluation using penman montheith and spanish equation the most common evaluation of eto and its practical implementation are for daily temporal resolution hence to test the gom for daily prediction the hourly values of the gom predicted rn gh and ra gh were integrated and used as input for the spanish and pm methods along with the daily average measured tair gh and vpdgh these were then compared with the calculated pm eto for season i and season ii using the meteorological parameters measured during the two seasons evaluation of eto by both methods for both seasons using the gom values was tested against that using pm with measured meteorological parameters as summarized in fig 8 and table 2 it can be seen that for season ii daily eto gh could be evaluated relatively accurately r2 0 983 re 3 14 mae 0 010 using the gom based rn gh using pm fig 8a the spanish equation fig 8b which uses rs gh instead of rn gh also provided accurate results r2 0 903 re 3 75 mae 0 231 compared with pm using measured meteorological parameters evaluation of eto using the gom predicted rn gh and rs gh for season i fig 8c d was further tested by comparing the results with the pm eto calculated based on the measurements of season i the comparison provided different results daily pm eto gh using the gom based rn gh had reduced accuracy r2 0 920 re 22 27 mae 0 43 with respect to pm eto calculated based on the measurements of season i similarly the spanish prediction provided even poorer results in term of re r2 0 844 re 65 20 mae 1 27 however these results are biased as they have an offset in the original inputs rs gh and rn gh which were evaluated based on the season ii gom for a different relative location in the greenhouse section 3 3 using the gom for season i resulted in underestimating rn gh by 34 61 fig 6b and most likely also τ these results suggest of the potential practical use of the gom model along with the pm or spanish equations for eto prediction the spanish model was proven to be accurate for predicting eto gh in naturally ventilated greenhouses covered with screens with no roof opening under arid conditions however by testing the ability of these equations to predict eto based on the gom developed for season ii it is apparent that the inputs rs gh and rn gh had a stable offset due to the different location of the sensor across the two seasons as well as the cloud effect see section 3 3 the fact that the spanish equation does not use rn gh but rs gh which was evaluated based on τ and rs out suggests that this offset originates mostly in the τ prediction and not the rn gh prediction this is further supported by the fact that using the penman monteith model which uses rn gh as input reduced the re from 65 20 for the spanish formula to about 22 27 because only measured rn gh and not measured rs gh was available for season i this assumption could not be validated the fact that the spanish equation resulted in a 65 20 prediction while the pm equation resulted in about 22 27 is probably because predictions of τ are less accurate and more sensitive to cloud effects than the prediction of rn gh as can be seen when comparing the results from figs 4j and k to figs 5d and e however the pm equation also requires tair gh and vpd whereas the spanish equation require only rs gh which as shown can be adequately derived from rs out φs and αs and knowledge of the geometric structure of the greenhouse thus the spanish equation provides a more straightforward approach to calculating eto gh from rs out at least for the conditions studied here using the suggested modeling method 4 summary and conclusions by using a machine learning based approach this paper demonstrates that rn gh can potentially be reliably predicted using rs out as the only measured parameter assuming the greenhouse s geometric structure and cover properties are known hence this study suggests that modelling of the greenhouse structure combined with a measurement of rs out together with calculated αs and φs can be used as a particularly effective method to accurately predict rn gh it was shown that accounting for the cloud effect with no additional measurement can lead to additional improvement in rn gh prediction the calculated rn gh using such method can in turn use to predict eto gh in greenhouses which are relatively decoupled from the outside environment for which et is dominated by the radiation balance as reflected by rn gh such decoupled greenhouses include naturally ventilated greenhouses which are common in arid semiarid and mediterranean climates under strong radiation conditions considering that the cover s optical characteristics can change during the growing season due to dust accumulation washing by rain and the cover s degradation the change in cover transmittance with time should be accounted for in future research a precise 3d definition or simulation of the greenhouse structure was shown here as a required parameter to allow precise prediction of rn gh using the rs out as the only measured parameter this approach will enable adequately predicting the rn gh for any point in the greenhouse which was shown here to be relevant considering the inconsistency of gom based predictions of rn gh across different locations in the greenhouse in the next step eto gh can be predicted from gom rn gh or rs gh by several available alternative approaches we showed here that the spanish equation is relatively robust across the two seasons suggesting that this equation may be useful for eto gh prediction in naturally ventilated greenhouses in arid conditions overall it was demonstrated that the gom approach can potentially provide precise irrigation predictions in decoupled greenhouses the fact that gom can be used to predict hourly eto gh makes this approach attractive for the development of a new generation of irrigation controllers which could provide precise irrigation for non potted soil cultivation inside naturally ventilated greenhouses thereby offering cheap and simple tools for farmers to optimize their irrigation regime additional research is warranted to test the eto gh prediction using the gom approach for different

9895,a reliable prediction of net radiation rn inside naturally ventilated greenhouses is critical for accurate evapotranspiration evaluation and thus for water saving considering that previous studies have indicated that evapotranspiration in such relatively decoupled greenhouses is predominantly controlled by greenhouse rn rn gh we hypothesized here that rn gh in naturally ventilated greenhouses can be accurately predicted using global solar radiation in the vicinity of the greenhouse rs out as the only measured parameter together with the calculated position of the sun defined by the solar elevation angle and solar azimuth to test this hypothesis we performed experiments in two adjacent greenhouses in the southern negev israel 30 96 n 34 69 e under arid climate in one of the greenhouses tomato was grown during winter 2017 2018 while in the other melon was grown during winter and spring 2018 2019 our analyses demonstrated that rn gh can be accurately predicted r2 0 982 using rs out as the only measured parameter while the global solar radiation inside the greenhouse rs gh and the ratio between rn gh and rs gh are predominantly dependent on solar elevation angle and solar azimuth as well as the greenhouse structure and cloud cover this paper shows that the impact of these properties on the association between rs out and rn gh can be accurately resolved using multivariate regression by the k nearest neighbors approach this suggests that computerized modeling of the greenhouse structure and light transmission can potentially enable precise evaluation of rn gh and therefore also reference evapotranspiration in naturally ventilated greenhouses using rs out as the only measured parameter a calculation based factor for the cloud effect on rs out

souza et al 2002 tüzel and leonardi 2009 it is estimated that today about 405 000 ha are cultivated under permanent structures fao 2013 greenhouse production systems can decrease crop water requirements by as much as 20 40 compared to open field cultivation however greenhouse growers usually apply more irrigation than the actual water consumption kitta et al 2015 levidow et al 2014 because in greenhouses our ability to precisely predict water consumption is greatly reduced compared to the open field with the vast expansion of greenhouse cultivation the need for proper irrigation management is essential irrigation practices in greenhouses are generally based on the grower s personal perspective i e irrigation is applied without monitoring the soil climate or plant water status bonachela et al 2006 the difficulty in predicting plant water consumption in greenhouses has led to the development of various approaches to determine the crop water requirements inside these structures these approaches range from adaptation to greenhouse conditions of the well established method using crop coefficient for reference et predication as proposed by fao 56 to computational fluid dynamics modelling of evapotranspiration using radiative and convective fluxes boulard and wang 2002 fernández et al 2010 gavilán et al 2015 gavilán and castillo llanque 2009 ilahi 2009 lozano et al 2017 evapotranspiration et and reference evapotranspiration eto can be measured or estimated by direct or indirect methods among the most common direct methods to estimate et from measurements are with weighing lysimeters or water balance allen et al 2011 baille et al 1992 indirect methods such as the penman monteith pm equation or the pm equation formulated according the food and agriculture organization fao 56 are frequently and successfully used to evaluate eto in the open field allen et al 1998 using nearby meteorological stations that provide the meteorological parameters required as input the pm equation has been shown to adequately predict et in greenhouses as well for instance several researchers found the pm equation to be very reliable in greenhouses for use in accurately estimating the et rates of tomato and lettuce boulard et al 1997 pollet et al 2000 the pm equation gave the best results for eto estimation in plastic greenhouses in spain fernández et al 2010 however the pm and other indirect meteorological based methods are less frequently used in greenhouses mainly because specific measurements are needed for each individual greenhouse to evaluate the net radiation rn external air temperature tair water vapor pressure deficit and wind speed ws in addition growers usually do not have the necessary knowledge and or sensors to operate this system or make the necessary calculations magliulo et al 2003 therefore today most irrigation controllers of high tech greenhouses make use of a simple linear equation with daily or weekly calibration using a lysimeter to correlate the external global solar radiation rs out with et even though this method is successfully used in many greenhouses it has great drawbacks because it requires a drain collection system for calibration which is costly and therefore not common that is limited to cultivation in pots katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 one simplification for greenhouses may arise from the fact that in naturally ventilated greenhouses the aerodynamic component of transpiration is significantly reduced due to the low ws and the crop is effectively decoupled from the greenhouse air katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 under these conditions et is mainly controlled by the radiation balance doorenbos and pruitt 1977 fernández et al 2010 katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 priestley and taylor 1972 this is especially true for greenhouses with insect nets and those with no roof opening both common in mediterranean semiarid and arid climates möller et al 2004 pardossi et al 2004 previous studies have indicated that in such greenhouses eto can be predicted fairly well by rn or global solar radiation alone by applying a fixed value for ws and the aerodynamic component gavilán et al 2015 katsoulas and stanghellini 2019 liu et al 2008 teitel et al 2008 valdés gómez et al 2009 valdés et al 2004 this means that prediction of rn or global solar radiation inside the greenhouse rs gh could provide a reliable method to predict eto inside naturally ventilated greenhouses however previous research has shown that rs gh distribution is itself heterogeneous boulard and wang 2002 wang and boulard 2000 which makes direct measurement of rs gh highly complex and costly considering that it should rely on multiple sensors to obtain a good representation of rs gh spatial and temporal distribution alternatively prediction of rs gh does not necessarily need to rely on radiation measurements inside the greenhouse potentially it can be evaluated using rs out the sun s location the optical characteristics of the greenhouse cover the greenhouse structure its orientation relative to the north and the direct to diffuse radiation ratio abood 2015 baeza and lópez 2012 baxevanou et al 2008 rosa 1988 wang and boulard 2000 a survey of rn prediction methods shows that the many proposed formulae can be summarized as two fundamental methods the first relies merely on tair brutsaert 1975 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 weiss 1982 wright and jensen 1972 while the second involves air canopy and soil surface temperatures bisht et al 2005 cui et al 2010 hemmati et al 2012 ortega farias et al 2000 saito et al 2006 the latter group complicates current methods of rn prediction due to the need for air crop and or soil temperature and reduces the likelihood of these methods being adequate for widescale use in commercial greenhouses especially low tech ones in addition complex equations were presented to determine transmissivity based on the angle of incidence of solar radiation boulard and wang 2000 our hypothesis was that the geometry of a greenhouse structure and cover together with solar elevation angle αs and solar azimuth φs can be used to predict rn gh inside the greenhouse which can then be used as a basis for adequate eto gh with rs out as the only measured parameter relying on recent advances in numerical simulations and machine learning this simplification can overcome the challenges associated with measurement of micrometeorological parameters inside the greenhouse as well as use of complex greenhouse transmissivity τ equations such computer simulation based prediction of τ to evaluate rs gh or rn inside the greenhouse rn gh can be followed by solving radiation based eto equations boulard and wang 2002 fernández et al 2010 wang and boulard 2000 prediction of τ and rs gh distribution for a greenhouse by computer models has already proven to be feasible and accurate baxevanou et al 2008 papadakis et al 1998 wang and boulard 2000 however rn gh rather than rs gh is the mechanistic determinant of eto gh and therefore most eto gh prediction models are based on the former our hypothesis driven objective was to test whether a machine learning approach specifically the k nearest neighbors knn can be accurately and efficiently used for τ rn gh and consequently eto gh prediction based on rs out as the only measured parameter a special focus was given to verify whether such approach could be adapted to any greenhouse for which et is predominantly dictated by the radiation balance such as in naturally ventilated greenhouses to achieve this meteorological parameters were measured inside and near two adjacent greenhouses in the winter and spring cultivation seasons over two consecutive years 2 materials and methods for our study a naturally ventilated greenhouse gh ii and a semi closed greenhouse gh i were used over the winter spring growing season in two consecutive years located in the southern negev israel 30 96o n 34 69o e with arid climate and loess soil type tomato was grown from december 2017 to february 2018 season i gh i totaling 55 days and melon was grown from december 2018 to may 2019 season ii gh ii totaling 157 days both crops in both seasons were trellised to 3 5 m height plants were irrigated three times a day using a drip irrigation system the irrigation amount was 6 mm per day in december and 5 mm per day from january until the end of the season divided into three equal openings per day according to standard agricultural practice in the area the greenhouses were arched multispan structures with side openings only covered with a 50 mesh net with an area of 1000 m2 and positioned one in front of the other fig 1 the greenhouses were composed of 4 spans of 8 m 32 m wide and 31 m long in total gutter was 4 m high and positioned along the n s axis the melon greenhouse gh ii was always open with no active ventilation system fig 1a thus the microclimate conditions followed the outside conditions through natural ventilation the tomato greenhouse gh i was closed during the day and the side walls were automatically opened to 2 m height if one or more of the following conditions was fulfilled greenhouse relative humidity rhgh 70 and air temperature tair gh 30 c the greenhouse was closed by the use of sidewall polyethylene curtains fig 1b and c the greenhouse was opened 30 min before sunset and closed again 30 min before sunrise an air circulation system was implemented in this greenhouse by use of a set of four air circulating fans installed at the end walls

algorithms for pattern classification and regression models knn was proposed in 1951 by fix and hodges 1951 and then modified by cover and hart 1967 knn has been identified as one of the top 10 influential methods in data mining wu et al 2008 consequently knn has been studied over the past few decades and widely applied in many fields bhatia and vandana 2010 and for many pattern classification problems such as pattern recognition xu and wu 2008 forestry chirici et al 2016 precision agriculture boubin et al 2019 ranking models geng et al 2008 object recognition bajramovic et al 2006 and event recognition yang et al 2000 applications knn techniques are a class of multivariate nonparametric approaches used for continuous or categorical prediction an important characteristic of the knn algorithm is that it is sensitive to the local structure of the data the algorithm used for the regression applied in this study included the following steps 1 compute the euclidean or maha distance from each of the query dependent points to the independent points 2 rank the distance of any data from each of the independent dataset values 3 find a heuristically optimal number k of nearest neighbors based on rmse this is done by cross validation using the actual observations 4 calculate an inverse distance weighted average of the dependent variable based on k nearest multivariate dependent neighbors the main difference between knn and a standard multivariable regression lies in the fact that the former does not assume a constant linear correlation between the variables rather it adjusts the correlations depending on each independent neighboring value and so can build a more complex regression pattern than a simple multivariate linear regression in this study we used the default knn model in the jmp statistical package 2 3 evapotranspiration models there are many models to predict and estimate et in this research we choose the pm model monteith 1965 penman 1948 as it has been recognized as a reliable method for eto prediction in greenhouses see section 1 it was used here as a reference to evaluate the eto prediction due to the complexity of the pm model and the fact that it is difficult to apply to greenhouses see section 1 we tested the performance of a different model in predicting eto in the greenhouses section 2 3 2 and compared to the eto predicted by the pm model 2 3 1 fao56 pm model the pm model monteith 1965 penman 1956 is aimed at a precise evaluation of et by reflecting the mechanistic effects of all of the basic meteorological parameters impacting this process this model further accounts for the properties of the canopy and soil regulating the response to the meteorological properties on et the fao56 pm equation is a simplified adaptation which refers to a grass reference crop et mm day 1 and is given by 6 et o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 rn is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa es ea is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 u2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 g was estimated as 10 of rn during the daytime and 50 during nighttime as suggested by allen 1998 based on a 10 year study in naturally ventilated greenhouses in a mediterranean climate fernández et al 2010 suggested that a fixed aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 can be used under the studied conditions along with a surface resistance of 70 s m 1 as suggested by fao 56 according to the relation between aerodynamic resistance and wind speed suggested by allen 1998 for grass reference et aerodynamic resistance of 295 s m 1 is equal to a fixed wind speed of 0 7 m s however we believe that more research is also needed to properly determine whether surface resistance of 70 s m 1 is accurate enough for greenhouses and so in this paper measured wind speed was used 2 3 2 radiation based method calibrated for spanish greenhouses this algorithm referred to as the spanish model which is based on eqs 7 and 8 was derived from 20 years of daily eto values calculated according to the fao 56 model and verified using a lysimeter 1983 2002 bonachela et al 2006 fernández et al 2010 orgaz et al 2005 7 for julian days jd 220 et 0 0 288 0 0019 jd g 0 τ 8 for julian days jd 220 et 0 1 339 0 00288 jd g 0 τ where τ is the greenhouse transmissivity the ratio between the inside and outside solar radiation g0 is the daily solar radiation outside the greenhouse mm day 1 2 4 geometrical optics model here a model termed the geometrical optics model gom fig 2 is introduced this model allows the prediction of τ the ratio between rn gh and rs gh rn ratio rs gh rn gh and eto gh using only measured rs out the calculated αs and φs roche 2011 and the multivariate regression using knn in multiple steps as follows 1 τ prediction using αs and φs for clear sky conditions only τcs 2 τ prediction for all conditions using τcs and a cloud factor cf the cf was defined as 9 cf 1 r s o u t r s o 100 clear sky was defined as cf 10 where rso is the clear sky solar radiation outside the greenhouse calculated as described by allen et al 1998 3 rs gh evaluation by the product of τ and rs out 4 rn ratio prediction using αs and φs 5 rn gh evaluation using the predicted rn ratio and predicted rs gh 6 eto gh prediction using various equations with the predicted rn gh and rs gh see fig 2 for the modeling scheme 3 results and discussion 3 1 τ prediction the prediction of τ based on rs out as performed by the gom requires a proper understanding of τ fig 3 presents a histogram of gh ii τ showing that this value is not constant variations can result from diffusion of the solar radiation e g by clouds and aerosols the irradiance contact angle with respect to the greenhouse cover as well as the greenhouse structure which can further affect the radiation fate following its entrance into the greenhouse it is clear from fig 3 that the τ prediction will require a more sophisticated approach than simply assuming a fixed number particularly when considering multispan greenhouses in contrast to what is frequently suggested for simpler structures fernández et al 2010 gavilán et al 2015 to study the effect of different factors on τ fig 4 presents the hourly correlation of ghtr with αs φs rs out and cf fig 4a d respectively assuming constant cover characteristics during this time frame the hourly ghtr is expected to predominantly be determined by the greenhouse structure the sun s location and clouds and aerosols nevertheless it is clear from fig 4a d that none of the parameters taken individually show a clear correlation with τ however higher r2 for the linear and knn based regression of τ with both αs and φs under clear sky conditions than the r2 for the regression of τ with each of the two latter parameters alone reflects a strong simultaneous dependence of τ on αs and φs fig 4e g the correlation of hourly τ with both αs and φs was best captured by knn r2 0 907 mae 0 016 re 0 0006 as can be seen in fig 4g for clear sky periods the fact that the knn based regression resulted in a significantly higher coefficient of determination than the linear regressions r2 0 407 fig 4e may result from the fact that knn takes into account second order dependence of the effect of the independent parameters on rs under varying conditions see section 2 2 1 the fact that τ is a function of both αs and φs rather than of each of these variables alone is mainly because the incident angle on the greenhouse cover is a significant determinant of the light transmittance which further depends on the tilt of the cover with respect to the ground and the structural properties of the greenhouse abood 2015 gupta et al 2012 wang and boulard 2000 note that in our study the impact of the structure on τ is further complicated by the structure s roof which was arched and multispan these greenhouse structural parameters affect τ simultaneously and in a complex manner note that the frame of the greenhouse causes shading and so the overall rs gh is a function of the 3d incident angle at a particular time the structure of the greenhouse and the location of the specific measurement inside the greenhouse in addition to the complex manner in which the geometric structure impacts rs gh both clouds and aerosols affect rs out and rs gh via radiation scatter and absorption as they increase the diffuse fraction of rs out wang and boulard 2000 and change the incident radiation angle dispersion and reflection michelangeli et al 1992 these effects in turn impact τ hence an adequate prediction of τ should rely on a multivariable regression which is specific to the structure type and orientation location on the globe hour of the day and cloud conditions in our case we test the hypothesis that machine learning algorithms such as knn can be advantageous in simplifying such complex phenomena the effect of clouds on our prediction is reflected by the significantly better prediction of τ for clear sky conditions fig 4e f vs all data fig 4g i note that the knn significantly improved the regression results for the latter dataset as well by comparing figs 4h and 4i r2 0 536 and r2 0 634 respectively it appears that the cf reduced the noise created by the clouds even though the r2 of the resulting τ was only 0 634 fig 4i rs gh predicted by the gom based on the measured rs out resulted in an accurate prediction r2 0 979 mae 13 831 re 0 923 fig 4l even for all of the data which included non clear sky conditions this is because the correlation between rs gh and rs out was initially good r2 0 910 and the gom application improved it there are other approaches to account for the cloud effects such as estimating or measuring the diffused part of rs out and using that as input in a prediction model rosa 1988 wang and boulard 2000 however measurement of the diffused fraction requires expensive instrumentation the estimation is complicated and from the results of our study our approach of using the cf seems to be satisfactory for agricultural use 3 2 rn gh prediction rn gh is key to the eto gh evaluation fig 5 focuses on the rn gh prediction by the gom using αs φs cf and rs gh as described in section 2 4 the figure demonstrates that rn ratio mainly depends on both φs and αs and is also affected by cloud cover for instance the rn ratio is highest at midday when the sun is at around 180 190 φs fig 5b and it generally increases with αs fig 5a and decreases with cloud cover fig 5c overall rn ratio can be well predicted based on only αs and φs by applying knn r2 0 88 re 0 001 mae 0 063 fig 5d whereas the results improved when adding the cf r2 0 923 re 0 004 mae 0 047 fig 5e it seems even that rn ratio is less affected by clouds and is more accurately predicted than τ as it had a higher r2 0 923 vs 0 634 of the τ prediction as with τ the dependence of rn ratio on αs and φs is complex and strongly depends on the greenhouse structure because by definition rn gh is the difference between incoming and outgoing radiation anderson and french 2019 it is also controlled by the temperature emittance coefficient and albedo of the crop and soil which determine the outgoing radiation in greenhouses rn evaluation is complicated by additional factors such as the greenhouse cover and structure which cause internal refraction critten 1983 and affect both incoming and outgoing radiation to our knowledge this is the first time that a prediction of rn ratio has been shown to be possible with geometric variables alone meaning that rn gh can be predicted using only rs out αs φs the greenhouse structure and cover properties while rn gh is very strongly correlated to measured rs gh r2 0 913 the regression between the two resulted in a deviation from 1 1 fig 5f using φs αs and cf together with the measured rs gh improved the prediction of rn gh r2 0 989 mae 9 497 re 0 005 fig 5g fig 5h demonstrates that even when using the rs gh predicted by gom the model still predicts rn gh to a high level of precision r2 0 955 mae 12 661 re 0 004 eq 10 is the knn model for predicting rn ratio using φs αs and the cloud factor for the particular experiment of season ii under these specific conditions the optimal k number of nearest neighbors to be considers was 6 in case αs φs or cf are missing then the average value over the whole period can be used as indicated by 37 763 179 994 and 0 225 respectively normalization is also critical as was indicated in section 2 3 2 all values must be normalized using their standard deviation for αs φs and cf which in our case was 16 635 56 673 and 0 245 respectively kdtable refers to a normalized euclidean distance lookup table for αs φs and cf with 1525 being the number of hourly measurements used to build the model it is important to note that this is an empirical equation which is valid for our particular study and not necessarily represent well other conditions including a different measurement point in the same greenhouse or a different greenhouse structure the main interest of using a machine learning method such as knn is that there is no need to account for complex relationships between the parameters as the algorithm can learn them by itself moreover the strong yet complex relationship between rn ratio to αs φs and cf suggests that modeling of the relationship by accounting for the specific greenhouse geometric structure can use as an excellent solution for reliable prediction of greenhouse rn 10 mean 1525 1 asconstant kdtable 1525 3 k nearest rows 6 if ismissing solarangle 37 763 else solar angle 16 635 if ismissing solarazimuth 179 994

open field eto evaluation including the one formulated by fao 56 to derive rn from rs and rn evaluation using the temperature and radiation emittance as proposed by ortega farias et al 2000 the fao 56 method did not provide a good prediction of rn gh in our greenhouse experiment re 18 88 table 1 while the emittance based method requires hard to measure parameters such as crop canopy temperature and or soil temperature based on previous studies it was suggested to use tair gh instead of canopy temperature and indeed for some conditions this gives good results in greenhouses ortega farias et al 2000 valdés gómez et al 2009 however under the conditions studied here the method suggested by ortega farias et al 2000 provided poor results re 29 49 table 1 moreover under arid climate high transpiration rates can cause a large difference between tair gh and canopy temperature of up to 10 c fig s1 invalidating the assumption that canopy temperature can be substituted by tair gh hence the measured canopy temperature is required for rn gh prediction when using this method in arid climates our approach as part of the gom is based on using αs φs and rs out to predict the rn ratio rather than expensive and complicated measurements the underlying assumption in this approach is that τ and rn ratio can be well predicted based on the position of the sun relative to the specific point of interest in the greenhouse by accounting for the greenhouse structure and cover properties note however that each point in the greenhouse has a specific geometric signature that reflects the solar incident angle on the cover shading and internal reflection caused by the structure similarly this signature is different for greenhouses at different locations on the globe and for greenhouses with different structure moreover the same greenhouse structure will have a different signature depending on whether it is oriented along the south north or east west axis however knowing the greenhouse geometric structure and the optical properties of the cover the gom approach can potentially predict rs gh and therefore rn gh for each point of a greenhouse based only on rs out and calculated αs and φs previous research has proven the feasibility of this approach for predicting τ and therefore rs gh boulard and wang 2002 papadakis et al 1998 wang and boulard 2000 however it was not implemented or tested for rn ratio or rn gh while the present study suggests that also the former parameter can be adequately predicted using the gom approach more research on the yearly pattern of rn ratio in different areas of a greenhouse is required to better understand the association between rn ratio αs φs and greenhouse structure before a generic model can be established 3 3 gom validation the gom was validated against a different dataset from season i the validation process compared the values measured during season i with the values predicted by the gom gom predictions for season i were performed using the same equations developed by the gom for season ii eq 10 s1 and s2 and the meteorological parameters measured during season ii as input to the model see section 2 4 the data were collected in a nearby greenhouse with about the same structure and azimuth however the measurement point was in a different relative location in the two greenhouses the season i dataset included rn gh but not rs gh measurements so all validations were done with respect to rn gh and eto gh fig 7 presents the prediction of rn gh for season i using the gom developed in season ii we can see from fig 7a that the gom rn gh accuracy is reduced when applied for season i as it deviates quite significantly from the 1 1 line this is probably because the measurement point was in a different relative location in the greenhouse in season i and in season ii coupled with the heterogeneity in solar radiation however it can be seen that for a clear sky the r2 of the rn gh gom is still very high 0 921 suggesting that generally the performance of the gom is good at resolving the association between rs out and rn gh but that the prediction can be improved by calibration for each location in the greenhouse this is in line with previous research which indicated that the radiation distribution in a greenhouse is not homogeneous baxevanou et al 2008 boulard and wang 2002 papadakis et al 1998 wang and boulard 2000 yet the high r2 for the regression between measured and gom predicted rn gh supports the assumption that a proper model simulating the radiation for each point in the greenhouse can predict rn gh and eto gh to a high degree of accuracy in this research we show that such a prediction is possible for rn gh and not only for rs gh as previously proven gupta et al 2012 papadakis et al 1998 wang and boulard 2000 fig 6b shows a further reduction in gom accuracy re 35 58 when all data are included rather than just clear sky data with a reduction in r2 to 0 790 note that the significant impact of the cf results at least in part from the fact that season i represented the cloudiest time of the year 3 4 eto evaluation using penman montheith and spanish equation the most common evaluation of eto and its practical implementation are for daily temporal resolution hence to test the gom for daily prediction the hourly values of the gom predicted rn gh and ra gh were integrated and used as input for the spanish and pm methods along with the daily average measured tair gh and vpdgh these were then compared with the calculated pm eto for season i and season ii using the meteorological parameters measured during the two seasons evaluation of eto by both methods for both seasons using the gom values was tested against that using pm with measured meteorological parameters as summarized in fig 8 and table 2 it can be seen that for season ii daily eto gh could be evaluated relatively accurately r2 0 983 re 3 14 mae 0 010 using the gom based rn gh using pm fig 8a the spanish equation fig 8b which uses rs gh instead of rn gh also provided accurate results r2 0 903 re 3 75 mae 0 231 compared with pm using measured meteorological parameters evaluation of eto using the gom predicted rn gh and rs gh for season i fig 8c d was further tested by comparing the results with the pm eto calculated based on the measurements of season i the comparison provided different results daily pm eto gh using the gom based rn gh had reduced accuracy r2 0 920 re 22 27 mae 0 43 with respect to pm eto calculated based on the measurements of season i similarly the spanish prediction provided even poorer results in term of re r2 0 844 re 65 20 mae 1 27 however these results are biased as they have an offset in the original inputs rs gh and rn gh which were evaluated based on the season ii gom for a different relative location in the greenhouse section 3 3 using the gom for season i resulted in underestimating rn gh by 34 61 fig 6b and most likely also τ these results suggest of the potential practical use of the gom model along with the pm or spanish equations for eto prediction the spanish model was proven to be accurate for predicting eto gh in naturally ventilated greenhouses covered with screens with no roof opening under arid conditions however by testing the ability of these equations to predict eto based on the gom developed for season ii it is apparent that the inputs rs gh and rn gh had a stable offset due to the different location of the sensor across the two seasons as well as the cloud effect see section 3 3 the fact that the spanish equation does not use rn gh but rs gh which was evaluated based on τ and rs out suggests that this offset originates mostly in the τ prediction and not the rn gh prediction this is further supported by the fact that using the penman monteith model which uses rn gh as input reduced the re from 65 20 for the spanish formula to about 22 27 because only measured rn gh and not measured rs gh was available for season i this assumption could not be validated the fact that the spanish equation resulted in a 65 20 prediction while the pm equation resulted in about 22 27 is probably because predictions of τ are less accurate and more sensitive to cloud effects than the prediction of rn gh as can be seen when comparing the results from figs 4j and k to figs 5d and e however the pm equation also requires tair gh and vpd whereas the spanish equation require only rs gh which as shown can be adequately derived from rs out φs and αs and knowledge of the geometric structure of the greenhouse thus the spanish equation provides a more straightforward approach to calculating eto gh from rs out at least for the conditions studied here using the suggested modeling method 4 summary and conclusions by using a machine learning based approach this paper demonstrates that rn gh can potentially be reliably predicted using rs out as the only measured parameter assuming the greenhouse s geometric structure and cover properties are known hence this study suggests that modelling of the greenhouse structure combined with a measurement of rs out together with calculated αs and φs can be used as a particularly effective method to accurately predict rn gh it was shown that accounting for the cloud effect with no additional measurement can lead to additional improvement in rn gh prediction the calculated rn gh using such method can in turn use to predict eto gh in greenhouses which are relatively decoupled from the outside environment for which et is dominated by the radiation balance as reflected by rn gh such decoupled greenhouses include naturally ventilated greenhouses which are common in arid semiarid and mediterranean climates under strong radiation conditions considering that the cover s optical characteristics can change during the growing season due to dust accumulation washing by rain and the cover s degradation the change in cover transmittance with time should be accounted for in future research a precise 3d definition or simulation of the greenhouse structure was shown here as a required parameter to allow precise prediction of rn gh using the rs out as the only measured parameter this approach will enable adequately predicting the rn gh for any point in the greenhouse which was shown here to be relevant considering the inconsistency of gom based predictions of rn gh across different locations in the greenhouse in the next step eto gh can be predicted from gom rn gh or rs gh by several available alternative approaches we showed here that the spanish equation is relatively robust across the two seasons suggesting that this equation may be useful for eto gh prediction in naturally ventilated greenhouses in arid conditions overall it was demonstrated that the gom approach can potentially provide precise irrigation predictions in decoupled greenhouses the fact that gom can be used to predict hourly eto gh makes this approach attractive for the development of a new generation of irrigation controllers which could provide precise irrigation for non potted soil cultivation inside naturally ventilated greenhouses thereby offering cheap and simple tools for farmers to optimize their irrigation regime additional research is warranted to test the eto gh prediction using the gom approach for different

9896,crop simulation models play an essential role in evaluating irrigation management strategies for improving agricultural water use in crop production in this study the aquacrop model was used to calibrate and validate the grain yield and biomass of 11 cultivars 9 winter wheat and 2 summer maize under full and water saving irrigation practices the model results were verified with the available data from the published literature under the full irrigation practice widely used by farmers in the region for winter wheat the normalized root mean square error nrmse was found to be between 2 00 9 90 for grain yield 2 40 10 85 for biomass and 0 42 19 61 for water productivity under water saving irrigation for winter wheat the nrmse range was found to be between 5 80 16 00 for grain yield 3 70 17 30 for biomass and 3 80 13 79 for water productivity for summer maize the nrmse was 5 95 6 08 and 16 41 under full irrigation and 9 51 8 41 and 3 60 under water saving irrigation for grain yield biomass and water productivity respectively for winter wheat and summer maize the simulation accuracy of grain yield was high under full irrigation with percent deviations under 11 00 in this study the simulation accuracy for winter wheat was low under water saving irrigation while the model simulated the yield and biomass for summer maize to acceptable accuracy the model can be reliably used as a tool to simulate grain yield and biomass across the ncp region for winter wheat and summer maize however the limitations of the model must be considered when simulating winter wheat under water stressed conditions keywords aquacrop crop simulation winter wheat summer maize north china plain 1 introduction china being the world s largest wheat producer and a major maize producer plays an important role in shaping the international markets greaves and wang 2016 northeast china nec is particularly important for china s gross agricultural production and has been one of the most sensitive areas to climate change in the country particularly during the last five decades lv et al 2015 china produces about 120 4 mt wheat annually xiao et al 2018 and is one of the major cereal producing countries in the world therefore any sudden decrease in crop yield in major cereal producing countries as a result of weather change or other factors can have negative impacts on global prices trade and the countries that depend on imports kent et al 2017 raising serious food security concerns in the north china plain ncp rainfall supplies are enough for summer maize but supplemental irrigation is also applied based on site specific needs in contrast winter wheat requires abundant groundwater irrigation across the region which has resulted in groundwater depletion over the last 30 years at the rate of 1 m year particularly over the last 20 years wang et al 2018 and is progressively creating severe water shortage for winter wheat irrigation in this region in the north china plain ncp full irrigation practices farmer irrigation practices are usually employed for winter wheat but reduced irrigation strategy to minimize irrigation water demand has also been explored in many research studies results from the experimental study by wang et al 2018 demonstrated a decrease in winter wheat yield but shortened growth period and improved water use efficiency when reduced irrigation strategy was employed for winter wheat and summer maize cropping rotation a shorter winter wheat growth period allowed for early maize sowing and an increase in maize yield breeding novel crop cultivars adaptable to climate change and water stress is one of the potential solutions but this approach requires an understanding of complex adaptive traits for climate change conditions chen et al 2012 crop models can calculate probabilities of grain yield levels for a given soil type based on the amount of rainfall and temperature rauff and bello 2015 crop growth models have been widely used to simulate the plant s potential growth with respect to varying climate crop type soil characteristics water and nutrient availability at different scales ranging from field level to continental scales the complexity is dependent on the physical details required for simulations using a crop model can be helpful in interpreting experimental results and supporting the decision making process for agricultural water management both calibration and validation processes require important crop observations including canopy cover above ground mass and dry biomass through ground measurements in controlled experiments kim and kaluarachchi 2015 collecting ground measurements and conducting field experiments can be a lengthy and costly process therefore the use of already tested and validated crop models can be a good way to manage time and cost whisler et al 1986 the crop models can be strategic in terms of planning and farm management practices like change in planting schedule irrigation water use or cultivar selection boote et al 1996 various field experimental studies have been carried out for winter wheat and summer maize within the north china plain ncp with only a few studies used their experimental data in crop models jin et al 2014 geng et al 2017 in this study we gathered experimental data from various published literature and used the same in the crop model however due to the variety of sources of information and differences in the on field practices certain inconsistencies in data introduced challenges in simulating the results the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the aquacrop model in simulating the canopy cover grain yield biomass and water productivity under abundant and water deficit conditions for different cultivars at multiple locations within the ncp region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study focused on the north china plain ncp which extends from latitude 32 09 n to 40 23 n and longitude 112 05 e to 121 41 e chen et al 2017 encompassing about 409 500 km2 kang and eltahir 2018 this region is an important agricultural area having 31 of china s arable land liu et al 2003 the ncp is located in the east asian temperate monsoon climate zone the annual mean temperature in the region varies from 8 c to 15 c and precipitation from 430 mm to 1390 mm which decreases gradually from southeast to northwest fan et al 2012 due to the monsoon climate 60 80 of annual precipitation is in summer june september the annual amount of sunshine varies between 2100 and 2900 h with varying latitudes li et al 2005 cropping systems in the region are diverse and varied due to socio economic conditions wheat maize multi cropping is the major cropping system in most of the north china plain while single cropping system mostly exists in hilly areas about 85 of the cropland area in the ncp produces china s 60 of wheat and 45 of maize zhang et al 2013 winter wheat is sown from early october and is harvested during june the following year after which summer maize is sown immediately to be harvested by late september sun et al 2010 during the past two decades the pattern of multi cropping system is on the rise 158 162 increase from 2000 to 2012 which has resulted in additional pressure on the surface and groundwater resources for irrigation yan et al 2018 ncp relies mainly on groundwater for irrigation the water requirement for winter wheat in the region is about 452 4 mm yang et al 2013 but the precipitation during its growth period is less than 150 mm tang et al 2018 the amount of groundwater used to make up for the shortfall varies between 210 mm to 270 mm across ncp depending upon the seasonal precipitation in that specific region the irrigation demand is usually higher in north china and lower in the south with clear differences between different regions yang et al 2013 on the other hand summer maize in north china plain shows higher yield under the rain fed condition with 60 80 annual rain concentrated in the maize crop growth period geng et al 2017 2 2 data collection and modeling crop conditions this study used the aquacrop v 6 0 to simulate winter wheat and summer maize for various cultivars and irrigation practices in the ncp region the aquacrop model developed by the food and agricultural organization fao is a crop water productivity engineering model for identifying the crop yield response to water this model is highly efficient in keeping track of incoming and outgoing water fluxes and changes in soil water content within the root zone boundaries steduto et al 2009 the aquacrop model has the capability to simulate crop productivity under water deficit conditions raes et al 2009 the model has been tested for wheat andarzian et al 2011 soddu et al 2013 and jin et al 2014 and maize stricevic et al 2011 greaves and wang 2016 under various irrigation practices and geographic conditions the model requires field level observations and provides a reasonable approach between detailed oriented crop yield simulation models and simplistic experimental models with considerable accuracy robustness and ease in handling kim and kaluarachchi 2015 the inputs of the model include climate observations fig 2 and s1 different field data including soil profile table 2 irrigation and agricultural management practices table 3 and crop phenologic growth stages in terms of its thermal time requirements table 4 to collect the field data several representative sites were selected in the ncp region fig 1 and ground data observed data for these representative sites was collected from published literature the selected sites included daxing ma et al 2018 and xiaotangshan counties in beijing jin et al 2014 wuqiao county wang et al 2018 gaochang county zhang et al 2018 and luancheng county in hebei umair 2017 xinxiang county in henan tang et al 2018 taian county in shandong bian et al 2016 and bengbu county in anhui geng et al 2017 from table 1 it can also be observed that the available studies with relevant data to evaluate the model were largely from hebei consecutively followed by beijing and shandong and one example from anhui and henan 2 2 1 weather data the minimum weather variables required for the aquacrop include the daily 10 daily or monthly minimum and maximum air temperature reference evapotranspiration eto and rainfall this study selected daily maximum and minimum temperature c at 2 m pressure pa at 2 m specific humidity kg kg at 2 m daily rainfall mm daily short wave radiation w m2 and wind speed m s at 10 m data to model the results supplementary material s1 these weather related variables were extracted from the china climate forcing daily aggregated products with a spatial resolution of 0 1 degree and developed by national tibetan plateau data center tpdc beijing china he et al 2020 the daily maximum and minimum temperature was extracted from the tpdc climate forcing 3 hourly data the meteorological data gathered from tpdc for temperature pressure and specific humidity was at the standard height of 2 m as required for crop simulation but the data for wind speed was at the height of 10 m which was adjusted using eq 1 allen et al 1998 as a requirement to measure evapotranspiration in the aquacrop model the eto variable was calculated from the relevant variables using the fao penman monteith equation using eq 2 allen et al 1998 1 u 2 u 10 4 87 ln 67 8 z 5 42 where u2 is the wind speed at 2 m above the ground surface m s 1 u10 is measured wind speed at 10 m above the ground surface m s 1 z height of

1 t is the mean air temperature c and u2 wind speed m s 1 at 2 m above the ground the tpdc meteorological data was correlated with the chinese meteorological administration cma data and both the datasets had a strong correlation for daily maximum and minimum temperature and monthly precipitation data the monthly average precipitation maximum and minimum temperature data for the growing seasons used in this study for all locations have been shown in fig 2 a h and the daily data has been provided in supplementary material s1 the groundwater data was also collected from the literature and in most of the study areas the groundwater table was recorded between 4 8 m since the rooting depth for both winter wheat and summer maize was considered at 1 2 m and 2 m respectively therefore water availability to crops through capillary rise was expected to be none or at least negligible 2 2 2 soil data the relevant soil parameters selected from the published studies include basic information on soil type number of horizons and properties of each soil horizon such as percentage of sand silt and clay depth bulk density and porosity at the effective rooting depth in this study the effective rooting depth for winter wheat has been taken as 1 2 m and for summer maize as 2 m not all the studies reported on all of the required soil parameters therefore soil and terrain database for china soter cn developed and maintained by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao at the scale of 1 1million koos dijkshoorn et al 2008 and chinese soil database a national soil dataset based on the second soil survey at the scale of 1 1000 000 jianping and ge 2016 were consulted to fill in the soil data gaps based on the collected information the saturated soil water content field capacity and permanent wilting point of each soil layer were calculated using the following formulas which are required inputs for aquacrop eqs 3 6 iwasakp et al 1983 saxton and rawls 2006 3 θ s 0 178 0 331 c 1 538 w 0 105 c 2 0 409 w 2 0 530 cw 4 θ c 66 58 23 24 ln θ s 5 θ w 38 75 12 53 ln θ s 6 w 1 γ ρ where θ s θ c θ w are volumetric water content cm3 cm3 at saturation also used as sat field capacity also used as fc cm3 cm3 and permanent wilting point also used as pwp cm3 cm3 respectively the water fraction by volume was then converted to volumetric percent of water in soil refereeing to sat fc and pwp in table 2 within the equation c is clay kg kg w is porosity cm3 cm3 γ is bulk density g cm 3 and ρ is soil specific gravity whose suggested value in the literature is 2 65 g cm 3 the soil data is provided in table 2 and by using this soil profile data aquacrop creates an automatic curve number cn for the soil group based on the ksat of the top horizon 2 2 3 irrigation and management data the available literature was also helpful in providing data on plant density sowing and harvest dates irrigation time and amount of irrigated water used during the crop growth period for each of the selected counties required for the calibration and validation of the aquacrop model table 3 the phenological data in terms of thermal time for these crops was also obtained from the literature to define four main growth stages emergence vegetative growth flowering and yield formation table 4 2 2 4 crop phenological data the aquacrop model by default calculates growing degree days gdd using the temperature data to estimate canopy growth which is detrimental for crop development thermal time is calculated by the model using eq 7 as follows 7 gdd t max t min 2 t b where gdd is growing degree days tmax is daily maximum air temperature tmin is daily minimum air temperature and tb is base temperature below which crop development stops aquacrop also incorporates upper threshold temperature topt above which crop development does not proceed with an increase in air temperature mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 for this study 0 c and 26 c were used as tb and topt respectively for winter wheat stricevic et al 2011 and 10 c and 30 c were used as tb and topt respectively for summer maize tsimba et al 2013 the aquacrop model uses thermal time to determine the green canopy cover and is crucial for crop development the crop phenology data was collected from the cited literature table 1 and organized in terms of thermal time required to reach maximum canopy cover flowering length building up harvest index the start of senescence and maturity the data for all cultivars based on the above mentioned stages has been provided in table 4 2 3 brief description of the aquacrop model the aquacrop model computes the daily water balance by separating transpiration and evaporation transpiration and evaporation are correlated with the area of soil cover with and without vegetation respectively the plant response to water stress is modeled based on leaf expansion stomatal conductance canopy senescence and change in harvest index the model subsequently measures the yield and biomass from daily transpiration values eqs 8 and 9 8 gy hi b 9 b wp σ tr where b is biomass in t ha 1 tr is crop transpiration in mm wp is the normalized crop water productivity in g m 2 hi is harvest index and gy is grain yield in t ha 1 the water productivity wp kg m 3 is the relationship between the crop yield and evapotranspiration and is defined as the

transpiration as determined using the aquacrop model 2 4 aquacrop model calibration and validation the aquacrop model was calibrated to assess its performance to simulate canopy cover crop yield biomass and water productivity at the selected study sites the data for calibration and validation of results was obtained from the relevant literature on the north china region the aquacrop model uses a range of parameters including conservative parameters that are not expected to change much despite change in location time and management hsiao et al 2012 daily weather data fig 2 and s1 soil profile characteristics table 2 irrigation and management measures table 3 and crop phenological data table 4 were provided in the model for the chosen cultivars and locations the cropping seasons during the calibration and validation stage for 11 cultivars have been provided in table 3 for all of the locations the calibration process was performed by running the model with required location specific input information and crop parameters table 5 based on values suggested in the literature for wheat jin et al 2014 and maize hsiao et al 2009 the calibration also involved adjusting the non conservative parameters which included initial canopy cover cco canopy growth coefficient cgc coefficients for triggering water stress affecting leaf expansion and canopy senescence until a close match between observed and simulated yield and biomass was obtained the harvest index hi used in the model varied for each cultivar based on the observed data therefore crop specific hi has been provided table 3 certain model parameters were set at default values whose data could not be accessed in the literature e g average root zone expansion and water stress coefficients the closest matches were produced when the coefficient values were set at moderately tolerant to water stress based on the observed data and crop parameters for the calibration the model performance was matched to simulate canopy cover fig 2 grain yield and biomass figs 4 5 canopy cover was validated at one location where data for the canopy cover was reported in the reference literature the simulated results of water productivity were also compared with the observed data the simulation results were evaluated using a set of statistical indices that have been used in various other studies to evaluate model performance chylek et al 2011 the choice of statistical indices can be dependent on their use for example in agricultural and environmental management the most common purpose of an index is to measure the accuracy of the prediction gauch et al 2003 the indices chosen in this study include root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse mean absolute error mae mean biased error mbe percent deviation and index of agreement d willmott et al 2012 the s i indicates simulated values and the m i indicates observed values and m is the mean of observed data in all statistical indices from eqs 11 to 16 for rmse a result close to zero indicates a better fit of the model for nrmse the fitting degree of the observed and simulated results are considered as excellent when an nrmse of less than 10 is achieved good if the nrmse is between 10 20 fair if the nrmse is between 20 30 and poor if the nrmse is greater than 30 bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 mae measures the absolute value of the difference between the simulated value and the observed value the values can range from 0 to infinite lower values represent a better agreement between simulated and observed values mbe reveals the average bias in the prediction smaller values are preferred ioa measures how well the model produced the estimates the value of 1 indicates a perfect match between observed and simulated and 0 indicates no agreement at all 11 rmse 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 12 nrmse 1 n i 1 n s i m i 2 100 m 13 mae 1 n i 1 n s i m i 14 mbe 1 n i 1 n s i m i 15 precent deviation simulated measured

water productivity wp for different winter wheat and summer maize cultivars in the ncp region the performance was evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the model with the field data that has been published in various studies between 2008 and 2016 figs 4 7 most of the available and relevant literature largely reported on winter wheat cultivars even though most of the ncp region follow double or triple cropping a total of eleven cultivars were evaluated in this study with nine zhongmai175 jingdong8 nongda399 shimai18 kenong199 bianong207 hengshui4399 weimai8 and jimai22 of them were winter wheat while the remaining two yedan13 and zhengdang 958 were of summer maize the majority seven of these reported cultivars zhongmai175 jingdong8 nongda399 shimai18 kenong199 bianong207 and yedan13 were irrigated using full irrigation also known as farmer practice while only two were irrigated using water saving practices hengshui4399 and weimai8 the data of the remaining two cultivars jimai22 and zhengdan958 was reported in the literature on both irrigation practices 3 1 calibration the main crop parameters used to calibrate the aquacrop model and simulate winter wheat and summer maize growth and productivity are provided in table 5 the harvest index used in the model varied for each cultivar based on the observed data therefore crop specific hi has been provided in table 3 3 2 canopy cover during the process of literature review the detailed data for the canopy cover cc was available for two growing seasons therefore the relationship between the observed and simulated canopy cover for winter wheat was validated only at xiaotangshan county beijing fig 3 during the calibration and validation stage the model predicted the trend in seasonal cc with higher accuracy the high values of d and lower rmse indicate the robustness of the model to simulate cc under both calibration and validation periods a strong correlation is shown between the observed and simulated values with r2 value of 0 985 and 0 981 for the calibration and validation period respectively 3 3 winter wheat simulation analysis 3 3 1 under full irrigation under full irrigation for both calibration and validation period for all winter wheat cultivars percent deviation was between 0 42 and 10 03 for grain yield between 0 07 and 10 85 for biomass and between 0 42 and 23 49 for water productivity with some cultivars simulated better than others overall the calibration and validation results show a reasonably close match between the measured values and those simulated by the model for winter wheat and summer maize as shown in figs 4 6 under full irrigation practices the best performing cultivars for grain yield were kenong no199 jimai22 shimai18 and jingdong8 with nrmse values 2 26 2 80 3 63 and 4 96 respectively this can be attributed to the irrigation provided at all key crop growth stages greening jointing anthesis and grain filling stage the simulation results of the winter wheat biomass under full irrigation practice show deviations between 0 07 and 10 85 for the calibration and validation period under full irrigation winter wheat cultivars jingdong8 zhongmai175 kenong199 and shimai18 showed the best simulation results for biomass with a percent deviation of less than 6 based on the error statistics available in fig 7 the most suitable cultivars to simulate biomass were jingdong8 rmse 0 29 t ha 1 nrmse 2 40 mae 0 29 t ha 1 and mbe 0 29 t ha 1 and kenong no199 rmse 0 51 t ha 1 nrmse 3 91 mae 0 42 t ha 1 and mbe 0 42 t ha 1 under full irrigation practices the model overestimated the biomass for kenong199 on account of two different weather data sources used in observed and simulation in all the literature studies cma weather data was used whereas in current study tpdc climate forcing data was employed the comparison of total water availability irrigation plus precipitation from observed and tpdc data is shown in fig 8 however the overestimation of simulated biomass of kenong199 from the observed is below 6 under full irrigation scenario under full irrigation for winter wheat there is a large deviation in both under and overestimation of simulated values of water productivity from the observed several studies sun et al 2006 indicate that under the traditional full irrigation practices where irrigation exceeds the actual water requirements during the growing season the water productivity reduces as a result of increased loss of water from soil evaporation and deep layer drainage overall there was a strong relationship between observed and simulated winter wheat grain yield rmse 0 436 d 0 977 biomass rmse 0 826 d 0 975 and water productivity rmse 0 248 d 0 790 under full irrigation 3 3 2 under water saving irrigation under water saving irrigation the minimum maximum percent deviations for winter wheat grain yield were 0 84 9 under calibration period and 0 50 20 79 under validation period respectively the results of all three cultivars hengshui399 jimai22 and weimai8 modeled in water saving irrigation were better simulated in the calibration period as compared to validation by minimizing the error through trial and error approach our simulation results concur with previous research iqbal et al 2014 which reported the percent deviation of winter wheat grain yield between observed and simulated values in the range of 0 6 to 7 0 and 0 6 to 14 1 for calibration and validation period respectively the winter wheat cultivars hengshui399 and jimai22 had a percent deviation between simulated and observed grain yield as less than 14 while larger deviations were recorded for weimai8 under similar water deficit conditions as experienced by the aforementioned cultivars some studies panda et al 2003 also state that water stress reduces the dry matter production in wheat in addition to water stress conditions for weimai18 this can be linked to a longer duration of accumulated growing degree days gdd from the anthesis stage while other cultivars under similar conditions had shorter grain filling duration under the water saving irrigation for winter wheat the simulation results of biomass were between 0 2 to 15 83 for the calibration period and 0 57 to 20 92 for the validation period biomass was largely underestimated due to the occurrence of early senescence from water stress conditions at critical crop growth stages the rmse mae and mbe were also above the desired threshold of 0 5 for both grain yield and biomass depicting the larger variation between observed and simulated under water saving irrigation for winter wheat the simulation results for water productivity were between 2 7 to 7 69 for the calibration and 2 08 to 19 21 for the validation period this can be attributed to increased stomatal resistance of plants under water stress conditions overall the relationship between observed and simulated winter wheat grain yield was relatively weak under water saving irrigation rmse 0 853 d 0 610 biomass rmse 1 930 d 0 575 and water productivity rmse 0 201 d 0 576 as compared to full irrigation 3 4 summer maize simulation analysis 3 4 1 under full irrigation this study considered the published data of zhengdan958 summer maize cultivar for both irrigation practices for the full irrigation in summer maize the deviation for grain yield was between 1 44 to 8 16 the nrmse for summer maize grain yield under full irrigation was 6 the mean absolute and biased errors were also within the acceptable range which could have a link with the availability of abundant water during the sm crop cycle with reduced dependency on irrigation supply yedan13 was the only other summer maize cultivar without required published information sufficient for the simulation of biomass and wp parameters while the grain yield results for yedan13 could also be not found to be sufficiently modeled in this study the simulation results of the summer maize biomass irrespective of irrigation practice show the percent deviation between 0 20 and 20 92 which agree to another research hsiao et al 2009 where the deviation has been presented between 0 4 and 21 9 for maize biomass simulation in the aquacrop model the less deviation has been recorded for the farmer irrigation practices as compared to water saving irrigation practices when the aquacrop model was evaluated for the summer maize cultivar zhengdan958 error estimates for the biomass values for rmse were 1 09 t ha 1 and 0 83 t ha 1 under full and rain fed irrigation respectively for simulated biomass heng et al 2009 also reported the rmse range between 0 46 and 6 51 mg ha 1 for maize using the aquacrop model for different locations for summer maize the overall relationship between observed and simulated grain yield rmse 0 528 d 0 841 biomass rmse 1 091 d 0 873 and water productivity rmse 0 304 d 0 683 was strong under full irrigation 3 4 2 under water saving irrigation under water saving irrigation in summer maize the deviation for grain yield was between 4 12 to 17 56 the water productivity was found to show good simulation results under water saving irrigation the water productivity of summer maize cultivars under water saving irrigation practice performed well with the rmse 0 06 nrmse 3 6 and mae 0 2 the error for simulation of water productivity for the same cultivar was higher under full irrigation practice with nrmse of 16 the relationship between observed and simulated grain yield rmse 0 513 d 0 794 biomass rmse 0 826 d 0 859 and water productivity rmse 0 064 d 0 806 was also found to be strong under the water saving irrigation these results suggest that the aquacrop model provides a better simulation of grain yield and above ground biomass under full irrigation for both winter wheat and summer maize cultivars in the ncp region the model simulated the water productivity results to a high degree of accuracy for summer maize d 0 806 as compared to winter wheat d 0 60 under water saving irrigation 4 discussion irrigation systems crop varieties kumar 2010 temperature and high carbon dioxide co2 concentrations all have significant impacts on crop productivity oh et al 2016 the relationship between all these parameters is interlinked and affects crop growth 4 1 variability in simulation results for wheat and maize yield and biomass for majority of the locations considered in this study the aquacrop model simulated the winter wheat and summer maize grain yield and biomass with higher accuracy when full irrigation was applied at all key crop growth stages while for the water deficit conditions errors and underestimations were observed in yield and biomass simulations for winter wheat cultivars similarly for summer maize the aquacrop model was able to simulate both crop yield and biomass with acceptable accuracy under both irrigation practices but the simulated results were observed to be slightly better suited for full irrigation practices full irrigation practices compensate for any lack of water from precipitation which enables the model to quantify results with reasonable certainty therefore the model performs comparatively well under full irrigation practices according to hoefsloot et al 2012 when calibrated with actual ground measurements differences are expected as crop models assume perfect growing conditions whereas in reality growth conditions can be limited due to weeds pests diseases pollutants or other unaccounted factors during the winter wheat growth cycle the precipitation is inadequate to meet the crop water demand therefore irrigation methods are necessary to fulfill demand shortages fig 8 for example upon examining the field data collected from various studies table 3 to simulate the grain yield and biomass it can be observed that farmers employing full irrigation practices in beijing hebei and henan which are largely dry regions during the winter wheat crop cycle applied irrigation water is in excess of 240 mm at key crop growth stages greening jointing anthesis and grain filling while in shandong which receives more precipitation the amount of water applied for full irrigation at the same crop growth stages amounted to around 120 mm much lower than in previous areas even though there was a difference in the amount of irrigation water utilized in different areas for full irrigation practices the parameters used in the aquacrop were able to simulate both yield and biomass within acceptable limits in the literature the sites with water saving irrigation practices 150 mm for winter wheat reported 75 mm of irrigation for the heading and jointing stages respectively water deficit conditions at the grain filling stage result in early senescence reduction of canopy coverage reduced grain yield and biomass wang et al 2016 similarly the studies carried out in turkey çakir 2004 and uruguay gimé and gimé nez 2019 also showed reductions of 20 30 in crop yield and biomass potential when water shortages were experienced at the grain filling stage for maize cultivars also in real life conditions in this study the aquacrop simulations underestimated the grain and biomass for water saving practices which ranged from 0 2 to 20 less than the actual potential for both of the crops another study conducted in the north china plain depicts that aquacrop underestimates grain yield for winter wheat in water stress conditions which is a likely consequence of accelerated canopy senescence under water stress resulting in limiting or restricted extraction of deep soil water by the underground roots system iqbal et al 2014 4 2 variability in simulation results for wheat and maize water productivity in terms of water productivity wp this study demonstrates that in the majority of cases simulation results have shown underestimations for water saving irrigation practices and overestimations for full irrigation practices in regards to the growth of winter wheat during the winter wheat seasons the water consumption under water saving irrigation was decreased by 33 as compared to full irrigation at the same location resulting in larger deviations for yield biomass and wp similar underestimations have also been cited in other studies when aquacrop was used for other crops evett and tolk 2009 soothar et al 2021 under water deficit conditions soothar et al 2021 has also cited higher water use efficiency in the simulated results when sunflower crop was modeled in aquacrop under water stressed conditions for summer maize the results of water productivity have highlighted better simulation performance under water saving practices as compared to full irrigation practices in case of summer maize the yield and biomass are slightly underestimated and the water productivity is overestimated under full irrigation this result is possibly due to the use of weather data sources that differ between this study and cited literature fig 8 under full irrigation the amount of water supply i e precipitation in the simulated environment is less compared to observed data this can have an effect on stress potentially restrict the production of yield and biomass as well as cause an overestimation in water productivity the total water supply mm under full irrigation is even less than the amount of water received when simulating water saving irrigation practices this difference resulted in water stressed conditions while the overestimation can be a result of the model using a constant value for normalized wp evett and tolk 2009 in contrast when simulating under water saving irrigation practices the water supply was found higher as compared to observed data resulting in improved performance to simulated yield biomass and wp with minimum deviations irrigation strategies utilizing crop responses to water stress at different stages of growth have also had better reported water productivity shang and mao 2006 the simulation results from this study report similar findings for summer maize cultivars utilizing water saving irrigation practices 4 3 sources of variations in this study the variation in the observed and simulated results was influenced by different sources of variation the literature consulted for data under water saving irrigation practices reported that ground conditions and soil fertility were kept artificially at optimal levels crops were provided with additional nitrogen phosphorus potassium sulfate and zinc sulfate as a strategy to obtain higher yields therefore when considering water saving practices in particular for winter wheat cultivars lack of the aquacrop performance to simulate grain yield and biomass can be attributed to the fact that the aquacrop model does not simulate nutrient cycles and effects of additional nutrients on the crop productivity steduto et al 2012 instead it uses field and environmental parameters including weather soil water balance groundwater depth and growing degree days to simulate grain yield and biomass therefore the model cannot account for the additional nutrients provided to the crops which is the likely cause of larger variation between observed and simulated grain yield and biomass in winter wheat under water saving conditions this can be a possible reason that the aquacrop model performed better to simulate crops under full irrigation practice particularly in north china where rainfall during the winter wheat growth period is less than 150 mm and 240 350 mm irrigation is applied to meet the crop demand which is 450 mm in this region it is pertinent to mention that the number of growing degree days from sowing to harvest for all winter wheat cultivars irrigated using water saving practices were less than ones using full irrigation practices collectively late sowing reduced irrigation of 150 mm 75 mm at jointing and 75 mm at anthesis and additional soil fertility were carried out as a strategy to obtain higher yield this might have contributed to the reduced performance of the model for water saving practices another source of variation between the observed and simulated results is the differences in the source of weather data used to calibrate and validate the model tpdc climate forcing dataset was used in this study for better spatial coverage whereas the observed weather data obtained from published literature was acquired from local weather stations which provide site specific data from fig 8 it can be observed that most of the parameters were observed to be highly correlated between the two sources with some variances to understand the effect of this variation fig 8 highlights the total water available for both observed data used for validation of model performance and the data used by the model to simulate crop parameters for observed data total water available is the sum of irrigation water applied by the farmers and the precipitation data from the local weather station whereas for model input the total water available is the sum of irrigation water applied obtained from the same literature and climate forcing dataset the effect of this variation on model performance is more pronounced for kenong199 in wuqiao county under full irrigation and zhengdan958 in luancheng county under water saving irrigation it can be observed that the total water supply for these cultivars in the observed data is higher resulting in higher biomass values while the same cultivars in the model environment demonstrated lower biomass values with lower total water supply other reasons for variation can be attributed to the genotype characteristics of different cultivars under varying temperatures and water deficit stresses since the aquacrop model can t incorporate the genetic information in the model therefore the genetic response of the plants to different temperatures water deficits and their interactions cannot be factored into the model yet another reason to realize is the range of management practices in the field conditions adopted to reduce soil water evaporation in order to limit the stresses and maintain productivity at the highest possible level under water stressed conditions the simulation results showed in this study indicate that the aquacrop model can be used with an acceptable level of accuracy to simulate grain yield and biomass under full irrigation practices for winter wheat and for summer maize under both irrigation scenarios the model performed at the medium level of accuracy under water saving irrigation practices for winter wheat in the ncp region the results also demonstrate the underestimation of the model for both yield and biomass of winter wheat under water deficit conditions which can be further explored along with other issues of effects of different soil types in water scarce conditions 5 conclusion the aquacrop model was calibrated validated and evaluated for 9 winter wheat and 2 summer maize cultivars in north china plain under full irrigation for winter wheat the error ranges between 2 00 9 90 2 40 10 85 and 0 42 19 61 for grain yield biomass and water productivity respectively under water saving irrigation for winter wheat the error ranges between 5 80 16 00 3 70 17 30 and 3 80 13 79 for grain yield biomass and water productivity respectively for summer maize under full irrigation the error was 5 95 6 08 and 16 41 for grain yield biomass and water productivity respectively under rain fed irrigation for summer maize the error was 9 51 8 41 and 3 60 for grain yield biomass and water productivity respectively therefore we can conclude that the model showed considerable agreement between observed and simulated grain yield for both winter wheat and summer maize under full irrigation however the model showed moderate agreement under water saving irrigation for winter wheat the model was able to simulate water productivity better under the water saving irrigation for summer maize declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

9896,crop simulation models play an essential role in evaluating irrigation management strategies for improving agricultural water use in crop production in this study the aquacrop model was used to calibrate and validate the grain yield and biomass of 11 cultivars 9 winter wheat and 2 summer maize under full and water saving irrigation practices the model results were verified with the available data from the published literature under the full irrigation practice widely used by farmers in the region for winter wheat the normalized root mean square error nrmse was found to be between 2 00 9 90 for grain yield 2 40 10 85 for biomass and 0 42 19 61 for water productivity under water saving irrigation for winter wheat the nrmse range was found to be between 5 80 16 00 for grain yield 3 70 17 30 for biomass and 3 80 13 79 for water productivity for summer maize the nrmse was 5 95 6 08 and 16 41 under full irrigation and 9 51 8 41 and 3 60 under water saving irrigation for grain yield biomass and water productivity respectively for winter wheat and summer maize the simulation accuracy of grain yield was high under full irrigation with percent deviations under 11 00 in this study the simulation accuracy for winter wheat was low under water saving irrigation while the model simulated the yield and biomass for summer maize to acceptable accuracy the model can be reliably used as a tool to simulate grain yield and biomass across the ncp region for winter wheat and summer maize however the limitations of the model must be considered when simulating winter wheat under water stressed conditions keywords aquacrop crop simulation winter wheat summer maize north china plain 1 introduction china being the world s largest wheat producer and a major maize producer plays an important role in shaping the international markets greaves and wang 2016 northeast china nec is particularly important for china s gross agricultural production and has been one of the most sensitive areas to climate change in the country particularly during the last five decades lv et al 2015 china produces about 120 4 mt wheat annually xiao et al 2018 and is one of the major cereal producing countries in the world therefore any sudden decrease in crop yield in major cereal producing countries as a result of weather change or other factors can have negative impacts on global prices trade and the countries that depend on imports kent et al 2017 raising serious food security concerns in the north china plain ncp rainfall supplies are enough for summer maize but supplemental irrigation is also applied based on site specific needs in contrast winter wheat requires abundant groundwater irrigation across the region which has resulted in groundwater depletion over the last 30 years at the rate of 1 m year particularly over the last 20 years wang et al 2018 and is progressively creating severe water shortage for winter wheat irrigation in this region in the north china plain ncp full irrigation practices farmer irrigation practices are usually employed for winter wheat but reduced irrigation strategy to minimize irrigation water demand has also been explored in many research studies results from the experimental study by wang et al 2018 demonstrated a decrease in winter wheat yield but shortened growth period and improved water use efficiency when reduced irrigation strategy was employed for winter wheat and summer maize cropping rotation a shorter winter wheat growth period allowed for early maize sowing and an increase in maize yield breeding novel crop cultivars adaptable to climate change and water stress is one of the potential solutions but this approach requires an understanding of complex adaptive traits for climate change conditions chen et al 2012 crop models can calculate probabilities of grain yield levels for a given soil type based on the amount of rainfall and temperature rauff and bello 2015 crop growth models have been widely used to simulate the plant s potential growth with respect to varying climate crop type soil characteristics water and nutrient availability at different scales ranging from field level to continental scales the complexity is dependent on the physical details required for simulations using a crop model can be helpful in interpreting experimental results and supporting the decision making process for agricultural water management both calibration and validation processes require important crop observations including canopy cover above ground mass and dry biomass through ground measurements in controlled experiments kim and kaluarachchi 2015 collecting ground measurements and conducting field experiments can be a lengthy and costly process therefore the use of already tested and validated crop models can be a good way to manage time and cost whisler et al 1986 the crop models can be strategic in terms of planning and farm management practices like change in planting schedule irrigation water use or cultivar selection boote et al 1996 various field experimental studies have been carried out for winter wheat and summer maize within the north china plain ncp with only a few studies used their experimental data in crop models jin et al 2014 geng et al 2017 in this study we gathered experimental data from various published literature and used the same in the crop model however due to the variety of sources of information and differences in the on field practices certain inconsistencies in data introduced challenges in simulating the results the objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the aquacrop model in simulating the canopy cover grain yield biomass and water productivity under abundant and water deficit conditions for different cultivars at multiple locations within the ncp region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study focused on the north china plain ncp which extends from latitude 32 09 n to 40 23 n and longitude 112 05 e to 121 41 e chen et al 2017 encompassing about 409 500 km2 kang and eltahir 2018 this region is an important agricultural area having 31 of china s arable land liu et al 2003 the ncp is located in the east asian temperate monsoon climate zone the annual mean temperature in the region varies from 8 c to 15 c and precipitation from 430 mm to 1390 mm which decreases gradually from southeast to northwest fan et al 2012 due to the monsoon climate 60 80 of annual precipitation is in summer june september the annual amount of sunshine varies between 2100 and 2900 h with varying latitudes li et al 2005 cropping systems in the region are diverse and varied due to socio economic conditions wheat maize multi cropping is the major cropping system in most of the north china plain while single cropping system mostly exists in hilly areas about 85 of the cropland area in the ncp produces china s 60 of wheat and 45 of maize zhang et al 2013 winter wheat is sown from early october and is harvested during june the following year after which summer maize is sown immediately to be harvested by late september sun et al 2010 during the past two decades the pattern of multi cropping system is on the rise 158 162 increase from 2000 to 2012 which has resulted in additional pressure on the surface and groundwater resources for irrigation yan et al 2018 ncp relies mainly on groundwater for irrigation the water requirement for winter wheat in the region is about 452 4 mm yang et al 2013 but the precipitation during its growth period is less than 150 mm tang et al 2018 the amount of groundwater used to make up for the shortfall varies between 210 mm to 270 mm across ncp depending upon the seasonal precipitation in that specific region the irrigation demand is usually higher in north china and lower in the south with clear differences between different regions yang et al 2013 on the other hand summer maize in north china plain shows higher yield under the rain fed condition with 60 80 annual rain concentrated in the maize crop growth period geng et al 2017 2 2 data collection and modeling crop conditions this study used the aquacrop v 6 0 to simulate winter wheat and summer maize for various cultivars and irrigation practices in the ncp region the aquacrop model developed by the food and agricultural organization fao is a crop water productivity engineering model for identifying the crop yield response to water this model is highly efficient in keeping track of incoming and outgoing water fluxes and changes in soil water content within the root zone boundaries steduto et al 2009 the aquacrop model has the capability to simulate crop productivity under water deficit conditions raes et al 2009 the model has been tested for wheat andarzian et al 2011 soddu et al 2013 and jin et al 2014 and maize stricevic et al 2011 greaves and wang 2016 under various irrigation practices and geographic conditions the model requires field level observations and provides a reasonable approach between detailed oriented crop yield simulation models and simplistic experimental models with considerable accuracy robustness and ease in handling kim and kaluarachchi 2015 the inputs of the model include climate observations fig 2 and s1 different field data including soil profile table 2 irrigation and agricultural management practices table 3 and crop phenologic growth stages in terms of its thermal time requirements table 4 to collect the field data several representative sites were selected in the ncp region fig 1 and ground data observed data for these representative sites was collected from published literature the selected sites included daxing ma et al 2018 and xiaotangshan counties in beijing jin et al 2014 wuqiao county wang et al 2018 gaochang county zhang et al 2018 and luancheng county in hebei umair 2017 xinxiang county in henan tang et al 2018 taian county in shandong bian et al 2016 and bengbu county in anhui geng et al 2017 from table 1 it can also be observed that the available studies with relevant data to evaluate the model were largely from hebei consecutively followed by beijing and shandong and one example from anhui and henan 2 2 1 weather data the minimum weather variables required for the aquacrop include the daily 10 daily or monthly minimum and maximum air temperature reference evapotranspiration eto and rainfall this study selected daily maximum and minimum temperature c at 2 m pressure pa at 2 m specific humidity kg kg at 2 m daily rainfall mm daily short wave radiation w m2 and wind speed m s at 10 m data to model the results supplementary material s1 these weather related variables were extracted from the china climate forcing daily aggregated products with a spatial resolution of 0 1 degree and developed by national tibetan plateau data center tpdc beijing china he et al 2020 the daily maximum and minimum temperature was extracted from the tpdc climate forcing 3 hourly data the meteorological data gathered from tpdc for temperature pressure and specific humidity was at the standard height of 2 m as required for crop simulation but the data for wind speed was at the height of 10 m which was adjusted using eq 1 allen et al 1998 as a requirement to measure evapotranspiration in the aquacrop model the eto variable was calculated from the relevant variables using the fao penman monteith equation using eq 2

datasets had a strong correlation for daily maximum and minimum temperature and monthly precipitation data the monthly average precipitation maximum and minimum temperature data for the growing seasons used in this study for all locations have been shown in fig 2 a h and the daily data has been provided in supplementary material s1 the groundwater data was also collected from the literature and in most of the study areas the groundwater table was recorded between 4 8 m since the rooting depth for both winter wheat and summer maize was considered at 1 2 m and 2 m respectively therefore water availability to crops through capillary rise was expected to be none or at least negligible 2 2 2 soil data the relevant soil parameters selected from the published studies include basic information on soil type number of horizons and properties of each soil horizon such as percentage of sand silt and clay depth bulk density and porosity at the effective rooting depth in this study the effective rooting depth for winter wheat has been taken as 1 2 m and for summer maize as 2 m not all the studies reported on all of the required soil parameters therefore soil and terrain database for china soter cn developed and maintained by the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao at the scale of 1 1million koos dijkshoorn et al 2008 and chinese soil database a national soil dataset based on the second soil survey at the scale of 1 1000 000 jianping and ge 2016 were consulted to fill in the soil data gaps based on the collected information the saturated soil water content field capacity and permanent wilting point of each soil layer were calculated using the following formulas which are required inputs for aquacrop eqs 3 6 iwasakp et al 1983 saxton and rawls 2006 3 θ s 0 178 0 331 c 1 538 w 0 105 c 2 0 409 w 2 0 530 cw 4 θ c 66 58 23 24 ln θ s 5 θ w 38 75 12 53 ln θ s 6 w 1 γ ρ where θ s θ c θ w are volumetric water content cm3 cm3 at saturation also used as sat field capacity also used as fc cm3 cm3 and permanent wilting point also used as pwp cm3 cm3 respectively the water fraction by volume was then converted to volumetric percent of water

literature is 2 65 g cm 3 the soil data is provided in table 2 and by using this soil profile data aquacrop creates an automatic curve number cn for the soil group based on the ksat of the top horizon 2 2 3 irrigation and management data the available literature was also helpful in providing data on plant density sowing and harvest dates irrigation time and amount of irrigated water used during the crop growth period for each of the selected counties required for the calibration and validation of the aquacrop model table 3 the phenological data in terms of thermal time for these crops was also obtained from the literature to define four main growth stages emergence vegetative growth flowering and yield formation table 4 2 2 4 crop phenological data the aquacrop model by default calculates growing degree days gdd using the temperature data to estimate canopy growth which is detrimental for crop development thermal time is calculated by the model using eq 7 as follows 7 gdd t max t min 2

incorporates upper threshold temperature topt above which crop development does not proceed with an increase in air temperature mcmaster and wilhelm 1997 for this study 0 c and 26 c were used as tb and topt respectively for winter wheat stricevic et al 2011 and 10 c and 30 c were used as tb and topt respectively for summer maize tsimba et al 2013 the aquacrop model uses thermal time to determine the green canopy cover and is crucial for crop development the crop phenology data was collected from the cited literature table 1 and organized in terms of thermal time required to reach maximum canopy cover flowering length building up harvest index the start of senescence and maturity the data for all cultivars based on the above mentioned stages has been provided in table 4 2 3 brief description of the aquacrop model the aquacrop model computes the daily water balance by separating transpiration and evaporation transpiration and evaporation are correlated with the area of soil cover with and without vegetation respectively the plant response to water stress is modeled based on leaf expansion stomatal conductance canopy senescence and change in harvest index the model subsequently measures the yield and biomass from daily transpiration values eqs 8 and 9 8 gy hi b 9 b wp σ tr where b is biomass in t ha 1 tr is crop transpiration in mm wp is the normalized crop

transpiration as determined using the aquacrop model 2 4 aquacrop model calibration and validation the aquacrop model was calibrated to assess its performance to simulate canopy cover crop yield biomass and water productivity at the selected study sites the data for calibration and validation of results was obtained from the relevant literature on the north china region the aquacrop model uses a range of parameters including conservative parameters that are not expected to change much despite change in location time and management hsiao et al 2012 daily weather data fig 2 and s1 soil profile characteristics table 2 irrigation and management measures table 3 and crop phenological data table 4 were provided in the model for the chosen cultivars and locations the cropping seasons during the calibration and validation stage for 11 cultivars have been provided in table 3 for all of the locations the calibration process was performed by running the model with required location specific input information and crop parameters table 5 based on values suggested in the literature for wheat jin et al 2014 and maize hsiao et al 2009 the calibration also involved adjusting the non conservative parameters which included initial canopy cover cco canopy growth coefficient cgc coefficients for triggering water stress affecting leaf expansion and canopy senescence until a close match between observed and simulated yield and biomass was obtained the harvest index hi used in the model varied for each cultivar based on the observed data therefore crop specific hi has been provided table 3 certain model parameters were set at default values whose data could not be accessed in the literature e g average root zone expansion and water stress coefficients the closest matches were produced when the coefficient values were set at moderately tolerant to water stress based on the observed data and crop parameters for the calibration the model performance was matched to simulate canopy cover fig 2 grain yield and biomass figs 4 5 canopy cover was validated at one location where data for the canopy cover was reported in the reference literature the simulated results of water productivity were also compared with the observed data the simulation results were evaluated using a set of statistical indices that have been used in various other studies to evaluate model performance chylek et al 2011 the choice of statistical indices can be dependent on their use for example in agricultural and environmental management the most common purpose of an index is to measure the accuracy of the prediction gauch et al 2003 the indices chosen in this study include root mean square error rmse normalized root mean square error nrmse mean absolute error mae mean biased error mbe percent deviation and index of agreement d willmott et al 2012 the s i indicates simulated values and the m i indicates observed values and m is the mean of observed data in all statistical indices from eqs 11 to 16 for rmse a result close to zero indicates a better fit of the model for nrmse the fitting degree of the observed and simulated results are considered as excellent when an nrmse of less than 10 is achieved good if the nrmse is between 10 20 fair if the nrmse is between 20 30 and poor if the nrmse is greater than 30 bannayan and hoogenboom 2009 mae measures the absolute value of the difference between the simulated value and the observed value the values can range from 0 to infinite lower values represent a better agreement between simulated and observed

water productivity wp for different winter wheat and summer maize cultivars in the ncp region the performance was evaluated by comparing the results obtained from the model with the field data that has been published in various studies between 2008 and 2016 figs 4 7 most of the available and relevant literature largely reported on winter wheat cultivars even though most of the ncp region follow double or triple cropping a total of eleven cultivars were evaluated in this study with nine zhongmai175 jingdong8 nongda399 shimai18 kenong199 bianong207 hengshui4399 weimai8 and jimai22 of them were winter wheat while the remaining two yedan13 and zhengdang 958 were of summer maize the majority seven of these reported cultivars zhongmai175 jingdong8 nongda399 shimai18 kenong199 bianong207 and yedan13 were irrigated using full irrigation also known as farmer practice while only two were irrigated using water saving practices hengshui4399 and weimai8 the data of the remaining two cultivars jimai22 and zhengdan958 was reported in the literature on both irrigation practices 3 1 calibration the main crop parameters used to calibrate the aquacrop model and simulate winter wheat and summer maize growth and productivity are provided in table 5 the harvest index used in the model varied for each cultivar based on the observed data therefore crop specific hi has been provided in table 3 3 2 canopy cover during the process of literature review the detailed data for the canopy cover cc was available for two growing seasons therefore the relationship between the observed and simulated canopy cover for winter wheat was validated only at xiaotangshan county beijing fig 3 during the calibration and validation stage the model predicted the trend in seasonal cc with higher accuracy the high values of d and lower rmse indicate the robustness of the model to simulate cc under both calibration and validation periods a strong correlation is shown between the observed and simulated values with r2 value of 0 985 and 0 981 for the calibration and validation period respectively 3 3 winter wheat simulation analysis 3 3 1 under full irrigation under full irrigation for both calibration and validation period for all winter wheat cultivars percent deviation was between 0 42 and 10 03 for grain yield between 0 07 and 10 85 for biomass and between 0 42 and 23 49 for water productivity with some cultivars simulated better than others overall the calibration and validation results show a reasonably close match between the measured values and those simulated by the model for winter wheat and summer maize as shown in figs 4 6 under full irrigation practices the best performing cultivars for grain yield were kenong no199 jimai22 shimai18 and jingdong8 with nrmse values 2 26 2 80 3 63 and 4 96 respectively this can be attributed to the irrigation provided at all key crop growth stages greening jointing anthesis and grain filling stage the simulation results of the winter wheat biomass under full irrigation practice show deviations between 0 07 and 10 85 for the calibration and validation period under full irrigation winter wheat cultivars jingdong8 zhongmai175 kenong199 and shimai18 showed the best simulation results for biomass with a percent deviation of less than 6 based on the error statistics available in fig 7 the most suitable cultivars to simulate biomass were jingdong8 rmse 0 29 t ha 1 nrmse 2 40 mae 0 29 t ha 1 and mbe 0 29 t ha 1 and kenong no199 rmse 0 51 t ha 1 nrmse 3 91 mae 0 42 t ha 1 and mbe 0 42 t ha 1 under full irrigation practices the model overestimated the biomass for kenong199 on account of two different weather data sources used in observed and simulation in all the literature studies cma weather data was used whereas in current study tpdc climate forcing data was employed the comparison of total water availability irrigation plus precipitation from observed and tpdc data is shown in fig 8 however the overestimation of simulated biomass of kenong199 from the observed is below 6 under full irrigation scenario under full irrigation for winter wheat there is a large deviation in both under and overestimation of simulated values of water productivity from the observed several studies sun et al 2006 indicate that under the traditional full irrigation practices where irrigation exceeds the actual water requirements during the growing season the water productivity reduces as a result of increased loss of water from soil evaporation and deep layer drainage overall there was a strong relationship between observed and simulated winter wheat grain yield rmse 0 436 d 0 977 biomass rmse 0 826 d 0 975 and water productivity rmse 0 248 d 0 790 under full irrigation 3 3 2 under water saving irrigation under water saving irrigation the minimum maximum percent deviations for winter wheat grain yield were 0 84 9 under calibration period and 0 50 20 79 under validation period respectively the results of all three cultivars hengshui399 jimai22 and weimai8 modeled in water saving irrigation were better simulated in the calibration period as compared to validation by minimizing the error through trial and error approach our simulation results concur with previous research iqbal et al 2014 which reported the percent deviation of winter wheat grain yield between observed and simulated values in the range of 0 6 to 7 0 and 0 6 to 14 1 for calibration and validation period respectively the winter wheat cultivars hengshui399 and jimai22 had a percent deviation between simulated and observed grain yield as less than 14 while larger deviations were recorded for weimai8 under similar water deficit conditions as experienced by the aforementioned cultivars some studies panda et al 2003 also state that water stress reduces the dry matter production in wheat in addition to water stress conditions for weimai18 this can be linked to a longer duration of accumulated growing degree days gdd from the anthesis stage while other cultivars under similar conditions had shorter grain filling duration under the water saving irrigation for winter wheat the simulation results of biomass were between 0 2 to 15 83 for the calibration period and 0 57 to 20 92 for the validation period biomass was largely underestimated due to the occurrence of early senescence from water stress conditions at critical crop growth stages the rmse mae and mbe were also above the desired threshold of 0 5 for both grain yield and biomass depicting the larger variation between observed and simulated under water saving irrigation for winter wheat the simulation results for water productivity were between 2 7 to 7 69 for the calibration and 2 08 to 19 21 for the validation period this can be attributed to increased stomatal resistance of plants under water stress conditions overall the relationship between observed and simulated winter wheat grain yield was relatively weak under water saving irrigation rmse 0 853 d 0 610 biomass rmse 1 930 d 0 575 and water productivity rmse 0 201 d 0 576 as compared to full irrigation 3 4 summer maize simulation analysis 3 4 1 under full irrigation this study considered the published data of zhengdan958 summer maize cultivar for both irrigation practices for the full irrigation in summer maize the deviation for grain yield was between 1 44 to 8 16 the nrmse for summer maize grain yield under full irrigation was 6 the mean absolute and biased errors were also within the acceptable range which could have a link with the availability of abundant water during the sm crop cycle with reduced dependency on irrigation supply yedan13 was the only other summer maize cultivar without required published information sufficient for the simulation of biomass and wp parameters while the grain yield results for yedan13 could also be not found to be sufficiently modeled in this study the simulation results of the summer maize biomass irrespective of irrigation practice show the percent deviation between 0 20 and 20 92 which agree to another research hsiao et al 2009 where the deviation has been presented between 0 4 and 21 9 for maize biomass simulation in the aquacrop model the less deviation has been recorded for the farmer irrigation practices as compared to water saving irrigation practices when the aquacrop model was evaluated for the summer maize cultivar zhengdan958 error estimates for the biomass values for rmse were 1 09 t ha 1 and 0 83 t ha 1 under full and rain fed irrigation respectively for simulated biomass heng et al 2009 also reported the rmse range between 0 46 and 6 51 mg ha 1 for maize using the aquacrop model for different locations for summer maize the overall relationship between observed and simulated grain yield rmse 0 528 d 0 841 biomass rmse 1 091 d 0 873 and water productivity rmse 0 304 d 0 683 was strong under full irrigation 3 4 2 under water saving irrigation under water saving irrigation in summer maize the deviation for grain yield was between 4 12 to 17 56 the water productivity was found to show good simulation results under water saving irrigation the water productivity of summer maize cultivars under water saving irrigation practice performed well with the rmse 0 06 nrmse 3 6 and mae 0 2 the error for simulation of water productivity for the same cultivar was higher under full irrigation practice with nrmse of 16 the relationship between observed and simulated grain yield rmse 0 513 d 0 794 biomass rmse 0 826 d 0 859 and water productivity rmse 0 064 d 0 806 was also found to be strong under the water saving irrigation these results suggest that the aquacrop model provides a better simulation of grain yield and above ground biomass under full irrigation for both winter wheat and summer maize cultivars in the ncp region the model simulated the water productivity results to a high degree of accuracy for summer maize d 0 806 as compared to winter wheat d 0 60 under water saving irrigation 4 discussion irrigation systems crop varieties kumar 2010 temperature and high carbon dioxide co2 concentrations all have significant impacts on crop productivity oh et al 2016 the relationship between all these parameters is interlinked and affects crop growth 4 1 variability in simulation results for wheat and maize yield and biomass for majority of the locations considered in this study the aquacrop model simulated the winter wheat and summer maize grain yield and biomass with higher accuracy when full irrigation was applied at all key crop growth stages while for the water deficit conditions errors and underestimations were observed in yield and biomass simulations for winter wheat cultivars similarly for summer maize the aquacrop model was able to simulate both crop yield and biomass with acceptable accuracy under both irrigation practices but the simulated results were observed to be slightly better suited for full irrigation practices full irrigation practices compensate for any lack of water from precipitation which enables the model to quantify results with reasonable certainty therefore the model performs comparatively well under full irrigation practices according to hoefsloot et al 2012 when calibrated with actual ground measurements differences are expected as crop models assume perfect growing conditions whereas in reality growth conditions can be limited due to weeds pests diseases pollutants or other unaccounted factors during the winter wheat growth cycle the precipitation is inadequate to meet the crop water demand therefore irrigation methods are necessary to fulfill demand shortages fig 8 for example upon examining the field data collected from various studies table 3 to simulate the grain yield and biomass it can be observed that farmers employing full irrigation practices in beijing hebei and henan which are largely dry regions during the winter wheat crop cycle applied irrigation water is in excess of 240 mm at key crop growth stages greening jointing anthesis and grain filling while in shandong which receives more precipitation the amount of water applied for full irrigation at the same crop growth stages amounted to around 120 mm much lower than in previous areas even though there was a difference in the amount of irrigation water utilized in different areas for full irrigation practices the parameters used in the aquacrop were able to simulate both yield and biomass within acceptable limits in the literature the sites with water saving irrigation practices 150 mm for winter wheat reported 75 mm of irrigation for the heading and jointing stages respectively water deficit conditions at the grain filling stage result in early senescence reduction of canopy coverage reduced grain yield and biomass wang et al 2016 similarly the studies carried out in turkey çakir 2004 and uruguay gimé and gimé nez 2019 also showed reductions of 20 30 in crop yield and biomass potential when water shortages were experienced at the grain filling stage for maize cultivars also in real life conditions in this study the aquacrop simulations underestimated the grain and biomass for water saving practices which ranged from 0 2 to 20 less than the actual potential for both of the crops another study conducted in the north china plain depicts that aquacrop underestimates grain yield for winter wheat in water stress conditions which is a likely consequence of accelerated canopy senescence under water stress resulting in limiting or restricted extraction of deep soil water by the underground roots system iqbal et al 2014 4 2 variability in simulation results for wheat and maize water productivity in terms of water productivity wp this study demonstrates that in the majority of cases simulation results have shown underestimations for water saving irrigation practices and overestimations for full irrigation practices in regards to the growth of winter wheat during the winter wheat seasons the water consumption under water saving irrigation was decreased by 33 as compared to full irrigation at the same location resulting in larger deviations for yield biomass and wp similar underestimations have also been cited in other studies when aquacrop was used for other crops evett and tolk 2009 soothar et al 2021 under water deficit conditions soothar et al 2021 has also cited higher water use efficiency in the simulated results when sunflower crop was modeled in aquacrop under water stressed conditions for summer maize the results of water productivity have highlighted better simulation performance under water saving practices as compared to full irrigation practices in case of summer maize the yield and biomass are slightly underestimated and the water productivity is overestimated under full irrigation this result is possibly due to the use of weather data sources that differ between this study and cited literature fig 8 under full irrigation the amount of water supply i e precipitation in the simulated environment is less compared to observed data this can have an effect on stress potentially restrict the production of yield and biomass as well as cause an overestimation in water productivity the total water supply mm under full irrigation is even less than the amount of water received when simulating water saving irrigation practices this difference resulted in water stressed conditions while the overestimation can be a result of the model using a constant value for normalized wp evett and tolk 2009 in contrast when simulating under water saving irrigation practices the water supply was found higher as compared to observed data resulting in improved performance to simulated yield biomass and wp with minimum deviations irrigation strategies utilizing crop responses to water stress at different stages of growth have also had better reported water productivity shang and mao 2006 the simulation results from this study report similar findings for summer maize cultivars utilizing water saving irrigation practices 4 3 sources of variations in this study the variation in the observed and simulated results was influenced by different sources of variation the literature consulted for data under water saving irrigation practices reported that ground conditions and soil fertility were kept artificially at optimal levels crops were provided with additional nitrogen phosphorus potassium sulfate and zinc sulfate as a strategy to obtain higher yields therefore when considering water saving practices in particular for winter wheat cultivars lack of the aquacrop performance to simulate grain yield and biomass can be attributed to the fact that the aquacrop model does not simulate nutrient cycles and effects of additional nutrients on the crop productivity steduto et al 2012 instead it uses field and environmental parameters including weather soil water balance groundwater depth and growing degree days to simulate grain yield and biomass therefore the model cannot account for the additional nutrients provided to the crops which is the likely cause of larger variation between observed and simulated grain yield and biomass in winter wheat under water saving conditions this can be a possible reason that the aquacrop model performed better to simulate crops under full irrigation practice particularly in north china where rainfall during the winter wheat growth period is less than 150 mm and 240 350 mm irrigation is applied to meet the crop demand which is 450 mm in this region it is pertinent to mention that the number of growing degree days from sowing to harvest for all winter wheat cultivars irrigated using water saving practices were less than ones using full irrigation practices collectively late sowing reduced irrigation of 150 mm 75 mm at jointing and 75 mm at anthesis and additional soil fertility were carried out as a strategy to obtain higher yield this might have contributed to the reduced performance of the model for water saving practices another source of variation between the observed and simulated results is the differences in the source of weather data used to calibrate and validate the model tpdc climate forcing dataset was used in this study for better spatial coverage whereas the observed weather data obtained from published literature was acquired from local weather stations which provide site specific data from fig 8 it can be observed that most of the parameters were observed to be highly correlated between the two sources with some variances to understand the effect of this variation fig 8 highlights the total water available for both observed data used for validation of model performance and the data used by the model to simulate crop parameters for observed data total water available is the sum of irrigation water applied by the farmers and the precipitation data from the local weather station whereas for model input the total water available is the sum of irrigation water applied obtained from the same literature and climate forcing dataset the effect of this variation on model performance is more pronounced for kenong199 in wuqiao county under full irrigation and zhengdan958 in luancheng county under water saving irrigation it can be observed that the total water supply for these cultivars in the observed data is higher resulting in higher biomass values while the same cultivars in the model environment demonstrated lower biomass values with lower total water supply other reasons for variation can be attributed to the genotype characteristics of different cultivars under varying temperatures and water deficit stresses since the aquacrop model can t incorporate the genetic information in the model therefore the genetic response of the plants to different temperatures water deficits and their interactions cannot be factored into the model yet another reason to realize is the range of management practices in the field conditions adopted to reduce soil water evaporation in order to limit the stresses and maintain productivity at the highest possible level under water stressed conditions the simulation results showed in this study indicate that the aquacrop model can be used with an acceptable level of accuracy to simulate grain yield and biomass under full irrigation practices for winter wheat and for summer maize under both irrigation scenarios the model performed at the medium level of accuracy under water saving irrigation practices for winter wheat in the ncp region the results also demonstrate the underestimation of the model for both yield and biomass of winter wheat under water deficit conditions which can be further explored along with other issues of effects of different soil types in water scarce conditions 5 conclusion the aquacrop model was calibrated validated and evaluated for 9 winter wheat and 2 summer maize cultivars in north china plain under full irrigation for winter wheat the error ranges between 2 00 9 90 2 40 10 85 and 0 42 19 61 for grain yield biomass and water productivity respectively under water saving irrigation for winter wheat the error ranges between 5 80 16 00 3 70 17 30 and 3 80 13 79 for grain yield biomass and water productivity respectively for summer maize under full irrigation the error was 5 95 6 08 and 16 41 for grain yield biomass and water productivity respectively under rain fed irrigation for summer maize the error was 9 51 8 41 and 3 60 for grain yield biomass and water productivity respectively therefore we can conclude that the model showed considerable agreement between observed and simulated grain yield for both winter wheat and summer maize under full irrigation however the model showed moderate agreement under water saving irrigation for winter wheat the model was able to simulate water productivity better under the water saving irrigation for summer maize declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

traditional and alternate management systems was maintained by using a combine at harvest annualized aboveground biomass and grain yield for a crop rotation was determined by averaging aboveground biomass and grain yields of crops within the rotation in a year total aboveground biomass or grain yield number of crops in a rotation 2 3 water and nitrogen productivity pre plant and postharvest soil water storage to a depth of 120 cm were determined using a calibrated neutron attenuation probe chanasyk and naeth 1996 crop water use hatfield et al 2001 lenssen et al 2014 2015 was calculated

precipitation april to september for each crop was calculated by adding daily total precipitation from planting to harvest assuming that water lost through surface runoff and deep percolation were negligible as slope of the land at the experimental site was 2 and precipitation is lower than evapotranspiration farahani et al 1998 water productivity for aboveground biomass and grain machado et al

2006 2008 and 2010 4 discussion 4 1 crop yield the greater annualized aboveground biomass with wp wbp and wbcp than cw in 2005 and 2010 table 3 when the growing season precipitation was near or above the 30 yr average fig 1 was probably due to soil water and n benefits of crop rotation compared to monocropping in wp wbp and wbcp lower water demanding crops such as pea and forage barley were followed by higher water demanding crops such as spring wheat and corn thereby increasing the amount of soil water available to succeeding crops and enhancing the overall yield of the rotation system pea matures 3 7 wk earlier than spring wheat and corn thereby increasing water available to succeeding crops lenssen et al 2018a furthermore pea being a legume fixes n from the atmosphere supplies n from its residue and reduces n fertilization rates to succeeding crops forage barley is also harvested 4 8 wk earlier than spring wheat and corn which enhances more water availability and yield of succeeding crops lenssen et al 2015 a longer duration of fallow between crops can capture precipitation and increase soil water storage as long as soil profile is not saturated and evaporation is lower than the precipitation capture farahani et al 1998 unger et al 2006 nielsen et al 2010 another benefit of the rotation system is the reduced infestations of weeds diseases and pests which help to enhance yields compared to monocropping where increased pest infestations reduces yield numerous researchers farahani et al 1998 johnston et al 2002 lenssen et al 2014 2018a 2018b schlegel et al 2017 2019 have demonstrated increased crop yield with diversified crop rotations compared to continuous monocropping absence of grain in forage barley reduced annualized grain yield with wbp compared to other crop rotations table 4 grain yield however was not different among cw wp and wbcp suggesting that crop rotation can sustain grain yield compared to monocropping early planting together with recommended seeding rate broadcast n fertilization and short stubble height increased grain yield with the traditional management system cool season crops such as spring wheat forage barley and pea are usually planted early in the semiarid northern great plains to take advantage of soil water from snowmelt and grain fill prior to greater drawdown of soil water enhancing yields however crops can be planted late to control delayed emerging weeds by pre plant herbicide application or tillage if soil water is not a limiting factor for crop production anderson 1999 lenssen et al 2014 near or above average growing season precipitation increased grain yield in 2005 and 2010 compared to other years below normal precipitation reduced aboveground biomass and grain yield in 2008 compared to other years the non significant effect of tillage on annualized aboveground biomass and grain yield was probably due to varying effect of tillage on various crops from the same experiment lenssen et al 2014 2015 found that spring wheat yield was greater with no tillage than conventional tillage during dry years but tillage had varying effect on forage barley yield in various years tillage had no effect on pea yield lenssen et al 2018a but corn yield was greater in no tillage than conventional tillage lenssen et al 2018b 4 2 soil water storage and water productivity reduced crop yield in the previous year likely increased pre plant soil water storage with cw in 2006 and 2010 table 3 however greater pre plant soil water storage with increased length of diversified crop rotation from 2007 to 2009 suggests that balanced water use by lower and higher water demanding crops may have better optimized soil water storage with crop rotations some researchers miller et al 2003 lenssen et al 2018a schlegel et al 2017 have observed greater pre plant soil water storage with diversified crop rotations than continuous monocropping reduction in water use by weeds due to efficient weed control from pre plant herbicide application during late planting and two to three weeks longer time in the spring to capture precipitation followed by increased soil water conservation due to tall stubble probably increased pre plant soil water storage with the alternate management system taller stubble can decrease evaporation loss and increase preplant soil water storage compared to shorter stubble black and siddoway 1977 aase and siddoway 1980 over six years soil water storage at planting under spring wheat was 31 mm greater in the alternate than the traditional management system lenssen et al 2014 pre plant soil water storage plays an important role in the performance of dryland crops nielsen et al 2005 unger et al 2006 schlegel et al 2017 efficient water use by previous crop likely reduced postharvest soil water storage with wbcp in 2005 2006 and 2010 table 3 when the growing season precipitation was near or above the normal fig 1 as discussed above high water demanding crops were grown alternately with low water demanding crops in wbcp this may have resulted in reduced water use by crops resulting in increased postharvest soil water storage with wbcp during wet years increased preplant soil water storage and growing season precipitation followed by reduced postharvest soil water storage resulted in greater crop water use with cw in 2006 and 2010 table 3 when the growing season precipitation was above the 30 yr average fig 1 in contrast increased preplant soil water storage increased crop water use with wbcp in 2007 when the growing season precipitation was below the average this suggests that diversified crop rotation can enhance water use compared to monocropping during dry years but monocropping can do so during wet years it would not be surprising to observe high water use with cw due to the presence of high water demanding crop such as spring wheat in every year greater water uptake due to increased seeding rate banded n fertilization late planting and tall stubble increased crop water use in the alternate management system in 2009 when the growing season precipitation was below the normal increased aboveground biomass but non different or lower crop water use increased bwp with wbp and wbcp in 2005 2008 2009 and 2010 table 3 in contrast non different aboveground biomass but lower water use increased bwp with wbp and wbcp in 2006 this suggests that diversified crop rotations used water more efficiently and increased water productivity compared to continuous monocropping either by increasing crop yields or decreasing water use increased water use efficiency with diversified crop rotations compared to continuous monocroping has been reported by several researchers lenssen et al 2018a schlegel et al 2017 lower crop water use but non different grain yield also increased gwp with wbcp in 2006 table 3 in contrast greater grain yield but non different water use likely increased gwp with cw and wp in 2009 absence of grain reduced gwp with wbp in both years increased grain yield but non different water use also increased gwp in the traditional than the alternate year management system table 4 this suggests that early planting broadcast n fertilization recommended seeding rate and short stubble increased grain water productivity in the traditional practice due to increased crop yield as with annualized crop yield the variable effect of tillage on pre plant and postharvest soil water storage water use and water productivity under individual crops probably resulted in the non significant effect of tillage on these parameters for the rotation system our results are dissimilar to those reported by some researchers hatfield et al 2001 nielsen et al 2005 unger et al 2006 who reported that soil water storage water use and water use efficiency were greater with no tillage than conventional tillage under dryland cropping systems differences in soil and climatic conditions among regions and tillage depth may have resulted in variable effect of tillage on these parameters our tillage depth was 8 cm compared to 15 20 cm depth in other regions which may have affected evapotranspiration due to differences in soil disturbance and crop residue accumulation furthermore our region receives 50 100 mm less precipitation than the central and southern great plains where the above researchers conducted their experiments although pea and forage barley were land rolled after planting land rolling was not done for spring wheat and corn in all rotations land rolling decreased pea yield olson et al 2004 lenssen 2009 but did not influence pea water use lenssen 2009 and spring wheat yield and water use lenssen and sainju 2019 these studies suggest that land rolling had minimum impact on crop yield and water use growing season precipitation near or above the average fig 1 increased preplant and postharvest soil water crop water use bwp and gwp in 2005 2006 and 2007 in contrast below average precipitation decreased these parameters in 2008 this suggest that precipitation has a large influence on soil water storage and crop water productivity in dryland cropping systems 4 3 nitrogen accumulation and productivity as tillage did not affect annualized aboveground biomass differences in n concentration for individual crops probably resulted in variations in aboveground biomass n accumulation between tillage treatments in various years the greater aboveground biomass n accumulation in no tillage than conventional tillage in 2005 table 5 was due to increased n concentration in aboveground biomass of forage barley and pea in that year table 8 in contrast the greater biomass n accumulation in conventional tillage than no tillage in 2007 and 2010 was due to increased aboveground biomass n concentration in forage barley and spring wheat in 2007 and in forage barley corn and pea in 2010 increased biomass n accumulation with wbcp in 2005 was due to increased aboveground biomass table 3 similarly increased biomass n accumulation with wp in 2010 was due to increased aboveground biomass table 3 and greater n concentration in pea and spring wheat aboveground biomass with wp in that year table 8 increased grain n accumulation with wp compared to other crop rotations table 7 was due to greater grain yield table 4 and pea n concentration table 9 similarly increased grain n accumulation in 2007 and 2009 table 7 was due to greater pea n concentration in 2009 and spring wheat n concentration in 2007 table 9 increased bnp with wp wbp and wbcp compared to cw table 7 was due to greater annualized aboveground biomass table 4 but lower amount of n fertilizer applied to crops in the rotations due to n supplied by pea nitrogen availability to spring wheat forage barley corn and pea were 101 67 78 and 6 kg n ha 1 respectively as a result available n for cw wp wbp and wbcp were 101 54 58 and 63 kg n ha 1 respectively after accounting for n credit from pea residue similarly increased gnp with wp compared to other rotations table 7 was due to increased annualized grain yield table 4 but lower available n the greater bnri and gnri with wp than other crop rotations except for bnri with wbp table 7 were also due to increased aboveground biomass and grain n accumulations but lower available n these results suggest that diversified crop rotations used n more efficiently in aboveground biomass than continuous monocropping similarly spring wheat pea rotation used n more efficiently in grain and removed more n in aboveground biomass and grain than other crop rotations allen et al 2016 reported that diversified crop rotation removed more n than monocropping the fact that tillage and management system did not affect grain n accumulation bnp gnp bnri and gnri suggests that these management practices had little impact on n relations crop rotation was the dominant treatment that influenced not only n relations but also crop yield water use and water productivity similar to soil water and crop water productivity greater aboveground biomass and grain n accumulations bnp gnp bnri and gnri in 2006 2007 2009 and 2010 was due to near or above average growing season precipitation fig 1 that promoted crop yield and n uptake below average precipitation reduced these parameters in 2008 5 conclusions crop rotation had stronger impact on annualized aboveground biomass grain yield soil water storage crop water use and water and n productivity compared to tillage and management system in dryland cropping systems in the northern great plains usa aboveground biomass pre plant and postharvest soil water storage and bwp were greater with wbcp but water use grain n accumulation gnp and gnri were greater with wp than other crop rotations the effect of crop rotation on soil water storage and water use was more pronounced in years with normal or above average precipitation absence of grain production with forage barley reduced annualized grain yield pre plant and postharvest soil water storage water use grain n accumulation gnp and gnri with wbp tillage and management system had variable effect on water use and aboveground biomass n accumulation in various years traditional management increased grain yield and gwp but the alternate management increased preplant soil water storage diversified crop rotations with increased length of the rotation increased annualized crop yield soil water storage and water productivity but a two year rotation of legume nonlegume increased water use and n relations compared to

is affected by soil water and n availability miller et al 2003 lenssen et al 2014 sainju et al 2019 in the semiarid northern great plains usa limited precipitation and a short growing season present major challenges for sustainable crop production crops can sometime fail due to the erratic nature of precipitation resulting in a substantial loss of producers farm income major et al 1991 nielsen et al 2010 because dryland crop production depends on soil water storage at planting and precipitation during the growing season as long as nutrients are not limited water from precipitation should be properly captured stored in the soil and used efficiently by crops unger et al 2006 nielsen et al 2010 to reduce the negative consequences of excessive n fertilization on soil and environmental quality improved management techniques are needed to reduce n fertilization rates without compromising crop yields as a result both soil water and n should be efficiently used to sustain dryland crop yields and meet food demand for the growing population unger et al 2006 nielsen et al 2010 lenssen et al 2014 in the northern great plains alternate year crop fallow rotation and continuous monocropping are conventional cropping systems still practiced by many producers crop fallow reduces annualized crop yield and soil organic matter compared to continuous monocropping which reduces yield compared to crop rotation due to increased disease and pest infections farahani et al 1998 johnston et al 2002 sainju et al 2009 diversified crop rotations that include cereals pulses and forages can increase crop yields compared to continuous monocropping by efficiently using soil water lenssen et al 2014 2018a 2018b schlegel et al 2017 2019 the sequence of crops in diversified crop rotations are arranged in such a way that low water requirement and n supplying crops are followed by high water and n requirement crops unger et al 2006 lenssen et al 2014 for example spring wheat and corn are high water and n demanding crops while pea and forage barley are low water and n demanding crops miller et al 2003 lenssen et al 2018b the n fixing and n supplying ability of pea residue can reduce n fertilization rate to succeeding crops miller et al 2003 lenssen et al 2018b sequencing cool and warm season crops in the rotation can also efficiently utilize soil water and control weeds anderson 2005 lenssen and cash 2011 several researchers lenssen et al 2018a schlegel et al 2017 have reported that soil water storage crop yield and water use efficiency were greater with diversified crop rotations than monocropping diversified cropping systems not only reduce farm inputs but also sustain dryland crop yields and enhance producers farm income singer and cox 1998 katsvairo and cox 2000 tillage has a variable effect on dryland crop yield water use and water and n use efficiency no tillage enhances dryland crop yields by increasing soil water storage and water use efficiency compared to conventional tillage by reducing evaporation and increasing infiltration capacity hatfield et al 2001 nielsen et al 2005 lenssen et al 2014 2015 observed that no tillage increased dryland spring wheat yield and water use efficiency compared to conventional tillage during dry years but tillage had a variable effect on forage barley yield and water use efficiency in various years numerous researchers payne et al 2001 machado et al 2008 lenssen et al 2018a reported no effect of tillage on pea yield but others lafond et al 2006 ruisi et al 2012 found increased pea yield with no tillage compared to conventional tillage dryland corn yield was greater defelice et al 2006 lenssen et al 2018b or lower vetsch and randall 2002 in no tillage than conventional tillage or not affected by tillage meyer aurich et al 2006 allen et al 2016 reported that tillage had no effect on forage barley yield and n use efficiency other management options such as seeding rate stubble height method of n fertilization and planting and harvest dates can affect crop yield and water use anderson 1999 lenssen et al 2014 increased seeding rate can increase water use efficiency by controlling weed growth and enhancing crop water uptake due to increased plant density tompkins et al 1991 tall stubble can increase soil water storage by trapping snow and reducing soil temperature wind speed and evaporation compared to short or no stubble nielsen et al 2005 unger et al 2006 some researchers black and siddoway 1977 aase and siddoway 1980 in the northern great plains have found that a stubble height of 30 38 cm increased soil water storage at the 0 20 cm depth by 28 40 mm compared to the stubble incorporated into the soil through tillage banded n fertilization can limit n availability to weeds and delayed planting after late application of pre plant herbicide can kill weed seedlings nichols et al 2015 strydhorst et al 2008 because of the reduction in crop yields due to conventional cropping systems improved management strategies are needed to enhance soil water storage yields water use and water use efficiency in the northern great plains we evaluated the effect of diversified crop rotation tillage and management system that included a combination of seeding rate date of planting method of n fertilization and stubble height on pre plant and postharvest soil water storage annualized crop yield water use and water and n productivity or water and n use efficiency from 2005 to 2010 in the northern great plains usa our objectives were to 1 examine how tillage crop rotation and management system affect soil water storage crop yield water use and water and n productivity and 2 determine which management strategies can enhance crop yield and water and n productivity we hypothesized that no tillage diversified crop rotation and the alternate management system would increase crop yield water use and water and n productivity compared to conventional tillage continuous monocropping and the traditional management system 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and treatments the field site was located 8 km northwest of sidney montana usa 47 46 n 104

through september prior to the initiation of this study the site had been in a cereal fallow rotation under fall and spring tillage for several decades the long term dryland field study was conducted from 2004 to 2010 comparing four crop rotations in two tillage and two management systems the experimental design was a randomized complete block in a split plot arrangement tillage system was the main plot factor and included no tillage and conventional tillage the conventional tillage included a single pass tillage to a depth of 8 cm with a field cultivator equipped with c shanks attached with 45 cm wide sweeps and coil tooth spring harrows and 60 cm bars the split plot factor was a factorial arrangement of management system and crop rotation crop rotations were continuous spring wheat

barley pea and corn received recommended n fertilization rates table 1 nitrogen fertilizer as urea and monoammonium phosphate was applied to all crops except pea which received n from monoammonium phosphate urea was broadcast to spring wheat forage barley and corn in the traditional management system and banded to spring wheat and forage barley in the alternate system nitrogen requirements to all crops except pea were adjusted for residual soil no3 n content in samples to a depth of 60 cm collected in the autumn of the previous year therefore available n included both soil and fertilizer n

plus planter deere and co moline il at a spacing of 60 cm herbicides and pesticides were applied before crop planting during growth and after harvest as needed crops were grown under dryland

and spring wheat aboveground biomass were similarly determined in late july to mid august two days before grain harvest pea and spring wheat grains were harvested using a self propelled combine equipped with a 1 5 m header from an area of 15 m2 grain yields were determined on an oven dried basis after drying a sample at 65 c for 7 d in september corn was harvested by hand from two 4 m rows 4

traditional and alternate management systems was maintained by using a combine at harvest annualized aboveground biomass and grain yield for a crop rotation was determined by averaging aboveground biomass and grain yields of crops within the rotation in a year total aboveground biomass or grain yield number of crops in a rotation 2 3 water and nitrogen productivity pre plant and postharvest

precipitation april to september for each crop was calculated by adding daily total precipitation from planting to harvest assuming that water lost through surface runoff and deep percolation were negligible as slope of the land at the experimental site was 2 and precipitation is lower than evapotranspiration farahani et al 1998 water productivity for aboveground biomass and grain machado et al

averaging these parameters for all crops within a rotation in a year for example pre plant soil water storage for wbcp was calculated by dividing total preplant soil water storage under spring wheat forage barley corn and pea by 4 because the number of crops in the rotation was 4 2 4 statistical analysis data were analyzed using the mixed procedure of sas statistical analysis systems version 9

2006 2008 and 2010 4 discussion 4 1 crop yield the greater annualized aboveground biomass with wp wbp and wbcp than cw in 2005 and 2010 table 3 when the growing season precipitation was near or above the 30 yr average fig 1 was probably due to soil water and n benefits of crop rotation compared to monocropping in wp wbp and wbcp lower water demanding crops such as pea and forage barley were followed by higher water demanding crops such as spring wheat and corn thereby increasing the amount of soil water available to succeeding crops and enhancing the overall yield of the rotation system pea matures 3 7 wk earlier than spring wheat and corn thereby increasing water available to succeeding crops lenssen et al 2018a furthermore pea being a legume fixes n from the atmosphere supplies n from its residue and reduces n fertilization rates to succeeding crops forage barley is also harvested 4 8 wk earlier than spring wheat and corn which enhances more water availability and yield of succeeding crops lenssen et al 2015 a longer duration of fallow between crops can capture precipitation and increase soil water storage as long as soil profile is not saturated and evaporation is lower than the precipitation capture farahani et al 1998 unger et al 2006 nielsen et al 2010 another benefit of the rotation system is the reduced infestations of weeds diseases and pests which help to enhance yields compared to monocropping where increased pest infestations reduces yield numerous researchers farahani et al 1998 johnston et al 2002 lenssen et al 2014 2018a 2018b schlegel et al 2017 2019 have demonstrated increased crop yield with diversified crop rotations compared to continuous monocropping absence of grain in forage barley reduced annualized grain yield with wbp compared to other crop rotations table 4 grain yield however was not different among cw wp and wbcp suggesting that crop rotation can sustain grain yield compared to monocropping early planting together with recommended seeding rate broadcast n fertilization and short stubble height increased grain yield with the traditional management system cool season crops such as spring wheat forage barley and pea are usually planted early in the semiarid northern great plains to take advantage of soil water from snowmelt and grain fill prior to greater drawdown of soil water enhancing yields however crops can be planted late to control delayed emerging weeds by pre plant herbicide application or tillage if soil water is not a limiting factor for crop production anderson 1999 lenssen et al 2014 near or above average growing season precipitation increased grain yield in 2005 and 2010 compared to other years below normal precipitation reduced aboveground biomass and grain yield in 2008 compared to other years the non significant effect of tillage on annualized aboveground biomass and grain yield was probably due to varying effect of tillage on various crops from the same experiment lenssen et al 2014 2015 found that spring wheat yield was greater with no tillage than conventional tillage during dry years but tillage had varying effect on forage barley yield in various years tillage had no effect on pea yield lenssen et al 2018a but corn yield was greater in no tillage than conventional tillage lenssen et al 2018b 4 2 soil water storage and water productivity reduced crop yield in the previous year likely increased pre plant soil water storage with cw in 2006 and 2010 table 3 however greater pre plant soil water storage with increased length of diversified crop rotation from 2007 to 2009 suggests that balanced water use by lower and higher water demanding crops may have better optimized soil water storage with crop rotations some researchers miller et al 2003 lenssen et al 2018a schlegel et al 2017 have observed greater pre plant soil water storage with diversified crop rotations than continuous monocropping reduction in water use by weeds due to efficient weed control from pre plant herbicide application during late planting and two to three weeks longer time in the spring to capture precipitation followed by increased soil water conservation due to tall stubble probably increased pre plant soil water storage with the alternate management system taller stubble can decrease evaporation loss and increase preplant soil water storage compared to shorter stubble black and siddoway 1977 aase and siddoway 1980 over six years soil water storage at planting under spring wheat was 31 mm greater in the alternate than the traditional management system lenssen et al 2014 pre plant soil water storage plays an important role in the performance of dryland crops nielsen et al 2005 unger et al 2006 schlegel et al 2017 efficient water use by previous crop likely reduced postharvest soil water storage with wbcp in 2005 2006 and 2010 table 3 when the growing season precipitation was near or above the normal fig 1 as discussed above high water demanding crops were grown alternately with low water demanding crops in wbcp this may have resulted in reduced water use by crops resulting in increased postharvest soil water storage with wbcp during wet years increased preplant soil water storage and growing season precipitation followed by reduced postharvest soil water storage resulted in greater crop water use with cw in 2006 and 2010 table 3 when the growing season precipitation was above the 30 yr average fig 1 in contrast increased preplant soil water storage increased crop water use with wbcp in 2007 when the growing season precipitation was below the average this suggests that diversified crop rotation can enhance water use compared to monocropping during dry years but monocropping can do so during wet years it would not be surprising to observe high water use with cw due to the presence of high water demanding crop such as spring wheat in every year greater water uptake due to increased seeding rate banded n fertilization late planting and tall stubble increased crop water use in the alternate management system in 2009 when the growing season precipitation was below the normal increased aboveground biomass but non different or lower crop water use increased bwp with wbp and wbcp in 2005 2008 2009 and 2010 table 3 in contrast non different aboveground biomass but lower water use increased bwp with wbp and wbcp in 2006 this suggests that diversified crop rotations used water more efficiently and increased water productivity compared to continuous monocropping either by increasing crop yields or decreasing water use increased water use efficiency with diversified crop rotations compared to continuous monocroping has been reported by several researchers lenssen et al 2018a schlegel et al 2017 lower crop water use but non different grain yield also increased gwp with wbcp in 2006 table 3 in contrast greater grain yield but non different water use likely increased gwp with cw and wp in 2009 absence of grain reduced gwp with wbp in both years increased grain yield but non different water use also increased gwp in the traditional than the alternate year management system table 4 this suggests that early planting broadcast n fertilization recommended seeding rate and short stubble increased grain water productivity in the traditional practice due to increased crop yield as with annualized crop yield the variable effect of tillage on pre plant and postharvest soil water storage water use and water productivity under individual crops probably resulted in the non significant effect of tillage on these parameters for the rotation system our results are dissimilar to those reported by some researchers hatfield et al 2001 nielsen et al 2005 unger et al 2006 who reported that soil water storage water use and water use efficiency were greater with no tillage than conventional tillage under dryland cropping systems differences in soil and climatic conditions among regions and tillage depth may have resulted in variable effect of tillage on these parameters our tillage depth was 8 cm compared to 15 20 cm depth in other regions which may have affected evapotranspiration due to differences in soil disturbance and crop residue accumulation furthermore our region receives 50 100 mm less precipitation than the central and southern great plains where the above researchers conducted their experiments although pea and forage barley were land rolled after planting land rolling was not done for spring wheat and corn in all rotations land rolling decreased pea yield olson et al 2004 lenssen 2009 but did not influence pea water use lenssen 2009 and spring wheat yield and water use lenssen and sainju 2019 these studies suggest that land rolling had minimum impact on crop yield and water use growing season precipitation near or above the average fig 1 increased preplant and postharvest soil water crop water use bwp and gwp in 2005 2006 and 2007 in contrast below average precipitation decreased these parameters in 2008 this suggest that precipitation has a large influence on soil water storage and crop water productivity in dryland cropping systems 4 3 nitrogen accumulation and productivity as tillage did not affect annualized aboveground biomass differences in n concentration for individual crops probably resulted in variations in aboveground biomass n accumulation between tillage treatments in various years the greater aboveground biomass n accumulation in no tillage than conventional tillage in 2005 table 5 was due to increased n concentration in aboveground biomass of forage barley and pea in that year table 8 in contrast the greater biomass n accumulation in conventional tillage than no tillage in 2007 and 2010 was due to increased aboveground biomass n concentration in forage barley and spring wheat in 2007 and in forage barley corn and pea in 2010 increased biomass n accumulation with wbcp in 2005 was due to increased aboveground biomass table 3 similarly increased biomass n accumulation with wp in 2010 was due to increased aboveground biomass table 3 and greater n concentration in pea and spring wheat aboveground biomass with wp in that year table 8 increased grain n accumulation with wp compared to other crop rotations table 7 was due to greater grain yield table 4 and pea n concentration table 9 similarly increased grain n accumulation in 2007 and 2009 table 7 was due to greater pea n concentration in 2009 and spring wheat n concentration in 2007 table 9 increased bnp with wp wbp and wbcp compared to cw table 7 was due to greater annualized aboveground biomass table 4 but lower amount of n fertilizer applied to crops in the rotations due to n supplied by pea nitrogen availability to spring wheat forage barley corn and pea were 101 67 78 and 6 kg n ha 1 respectively as a result available n for cw wp wbp and wbcp were 101 54 58 and 63 kg n ha 1 respectively after accounting for n credit from pea residue similarly increased gnp with wp compared to other rotations table 7 was due to increased annualized grain yield table 4 but lower available n the greater bnri and gnri with wp than other crop rotations except for bnri with wbp table 7 were also due to increased aboveground biomass and grain n accumulations but lower available n these results suggest that diversified crop rotations used n more efficiently in aboveground biomass than continuous monocropping similarly spring wheat pea rotation used n more efficiently in grain and removed more n in aboveground biomass and grain than other crop rotations allen et al 2016 reported that diversified crop rotation removed more n than monocropping the fact that tillage and management system did not affect grain n accumulation bnp gnp bnri and gnri suggests that these management practices had little impact on n relations crop rotation was the dominant treatment that influenced not only n relations but also crop yield water use and water productivity similar to soil water and crop water productivity greater aboveground biomass and grain n accumulations bnp gnp bnri and gnri in 2006 2007 2009 and 2010 was due to near or above average growing season precipitation fig 1 that promoted crop yield and n uptake below average precipitation reduced these parameters in 2008 5 conclusions crop rotation had stronger impact on annualized aboveground biomass grain yield soil water storage crop water use and water and n productivity compared to tillage and management system in dryland cropping systems in the northern great plains usa aboveground biomass pre plant and postharvest soil water storage and bwp were greater with wbcp but water use grain n accumulation gnp and gnri were greater with wp than other crop rotations the effect of crop rotation on soil water storage and water use was more pronounced in years with normal or above average precipitation absence of grain production with forage barley reduced annualized grain yield pre plant and postharvest soil water storage water use grain n accumulation gnp and gnri with wbp tillage and management system had variable effect on water use and aboveground biomass n accumulation in various years traditional management increased grain yield and gwp but the alternate management increased preplant soil water storage diversified crop rotations with increased length of the rotation increased annualized crop yield soil water storage and water productivity but a two year rotation of legume nonlegume increased water use and n relations compared to

9898,the rational close planting in agricultural production is an old topic yet it is so far unclear whether the optimum population density nopd is dependent on soil water availability and its mechanism in dryland crops to address this issue we established a mathematical model of nopd dynamics under soil moisture gradients and performed a modeling verification from laboratory to field using wheat as testing material in pot culture experiment with 3 moisture gradients and 9 planting densities the quadratic function fitting of yield density relation indicated that old landrace and modern cultivar shared a similar increasing trend of nopd in response to soil water availability the biomass density relation displayed a typical mode of asymptotical line and conformed to the law of constant final yield we therefore established a classic equation of nopd k α 1 via adopting the scaling exponent α between grain yield and body size aboveground biomass and the density producing half of maximum biomass k with the increasing drought stress the increasing extent of k was evidently lower than α 1 suggesting that the nopd decreased along with increasing drought stress to verify the above model we therefore performed a field experiment and found that the nopd under the rain fed condition no irrigation was lowered by 32 4 in 2017 and 16 7 in 2018 respectively compared to that of supplemental irrigation interestingly the biomass density relationship was parabolic under field condition which could be well fitted by quadratic function we thus established an improved model of nopd 2 a α 1 where a referred to the symmetrical axis of biomass density quadratic function and remained relatively stable regardless of soil moisture since the α became significantly greater under the rain fed condition p 0 05 the nopd was lowered by drought stress our findings highlighted a critical role of the plastic allometric relations to affect the nopd dynamics suggesting that lower seeding density would be more favorable for field production of wheats in dry environment keywords drought stress optimum population density nopd law of constant final yield yield biomass density relation dryland wheat modeling verification 1 introduction the rational close planting in agricultural production could maximize economic yield anderson et al 2004 tokatlidis 2014 willey and heath 1969 in agricultural systems the low planting densities do not enable crops to make full utilization of space and resources while the higher densities also frequently result in establishment loss and reproductive failure liu et al 2008 existing investigations showed that higher sowing rates can increase stand density and intra speciﬁc competition among plants resulting in higher plant mortality pickard 1984 therefore both high and low seeding rates are unfavorable for yield maximization as early as in 1940 s quadratic function simulation has been used to study the relationships between yield and plant density hudson 1941 quadratic function is a continuous function with a parabolic curve which is symmetrical about the maximum value of yield besides the curvature of the curve can significantly vary from growth environments and crop genotypes when the quadratic function is used to simulate the yield density relations these features enable the quadratic function simulation to be an accurate and simple method for investigating yield density relationship and estimating optimum population density of high yield nopd willey and heath 1969 yahuza 2011 this method has been used in many previous studies chen et al 2008 fischer et al 2019 tokatlidis 2014 by simulating with quadratic functions the maize hybrids released at different eras displayed differentiate nopd sangoi et al 2002 similar studies were also reported in other grain crops such as grain sorghum myers and foale 1981 wheat anderson 1986 chen et al 2008 and legumes gan et al 2003 however this method has frequently met the restriction in evaluating the interaction between crop yield and plant density for example the symmetry nature of quadratic function could limit the simulation accuracy under high and low plant densities willey and heath 1969 also the parameters in quadratic function are thought to lack ecological or biological significance yahuza 2011 as a critical abiotic limiting factor alqudah et al 2011 chai et al 2015 drought stress plays a decisive effect on the formation of nopd in dryland wheat previous agronomic studies suggested that the nopd of dryland wheat was decreased under drought stress anderson et al 2004 cima et al 2004 fang et al 2010 the nopd was positively associated with rainfall amount tokatlidis 2014 yet the ecological implications underlying such phenomenon still remain unclear in general yield formation is frequently affected by aboveground biomass and harvest index hi therefore the deduced yield biomass density relations play a significant role in understanding the mechanism of the density dependent yield formation under drought stress generally aboveground biomass accumulation is a crucial factor that significantly affects yield formation richards et al 2019 to most extent the biomass density relation can quantitatively account for the yield density relation the theory of population ecology shows that there are generally three types of biomass density relations including self thinning in crowded population interspecific scaling and simple biomass density relation at a given time weiner and freckleton 2010 in most cases much attention has been paid on the first two types of relations enquist et al 1998 yet the importance of simple yield density relations at a specific time has not been fully studied weiner and freckleton 2010 in this regard a widely used theory is the law of constant final yield this law defines that biomass accumulation would become constant at relatively high densities farazdaghi and harris 1968 when incorporating the law of constant finial yield into the michaelis menten equation the analyses on biomass accumulation dynamics would be widely applicable the new equation can depict the law of constant final yield in the simplest way interestingly in case the total biomass accumulation is viewed as a chemical reaction the planting density can be taken as its catalytic agent weiner and freckleton 2010 another important factor determining the yield is harvest index hi which is defined as the ratio of grain yield to aboveground biomass body size however the hi may change in response to the plant density and drought stress as grain allocation is highly size dependent in general the grain yield of plants is mainly decided by body size eziz et al 2017 müller et al 2000 and the size dependent allocation is popular in seed plants which is termed as the allometric allocation or apparent plasticity mcconnaughay and coleman 1999 but some researchers also suggest that a small proportion of variations in grain yield are due to environmental factors which could be important in population production weiner 2004 weiner et al 2009 in this circumstance the allometric allocation trajectory could be modified by environmental factors i e so called true plasticity weiner 2004 in the field of metabolic theory the term allometry is referred to as the apparent plasticity and the term plasticity as the true plasticity with regard to the allometric allocation relations drought stress is frequently viewed as a provoker of plasticity in dryland wheat lv et al 2019 xu et al 2010 however it remains unclear how the population grain production and the yield density relations are affected by the plasticity provoked by drought stress since the hi is defined as the proportion of grain mass into aboveground biomass the plasticity provoked by drought stress may result in the changes in yield density relations as well as the nopd on the basis of above descriptions we therefore hypothesize that the plasticity in allometric allocation relations between grain yield and aboveground biomass would be responsible for the decreased nopd under drought stress to verify this hypothesis a mathematical model was established and verified in pot culture and field experiments the major objectives of this study were designed as follows 1 to determine the dynamics of biomass accumulation in response to planting densities and soil water availability from laboratory to field 2 to investigate how the nopd of dryland wheat responds to drought stress and if there exists a difference in the wheat cultivars released at different eras 3 to verify the reliability and adaptability of above results in rain fed field condition using an updated biomass yield density model and 4 to explore the ecological mechanism underlying the changed nopd under drought stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and experimental design 2 1 1 pot culture experiment in growth chamber dryland hexaploidy wheat cultivars monkhead and longchun8275 bred at different eras in the northwest rain fed regions of china were chosen as the materials monkhead was popularly planted in the northwest of china from 1940s to 1970s while the newly released cultivar longchun8275 was popular since the 1990s the monkhead was awnless and highly tillering while the awned longchun8275 had less tillers song et al 2009 zhu and zhang 2013 the experiment was carried out in the growth chamber in the yuzhong campus 35 56 n 104 09 e of lanzhou university during 2016 growth season the pots were cylindrical with 0 2 m diameter and 0 3 m height each pot was filled with 6 5 kg of loessial soil mixed with vermiculite v v 2 1 and the height of the fill inside the pots was about 0 25 m the mixed soils used for pot culture experiment had a pot capacity pc turner 2019 of 31 5 and a permanent wilting point of 5 1 nutrient solution containing 3 64 g of nh4no3 and 1 48 g of kh2po4 was applied to each pot before sowing before imposing drought stress the pots were kept adequately watered 80 pc and allowed to dehydrate gradually water treatments including well watered ww 80 pc intermediately stressed is 55 pc and severely stressed ss 30 pc were imposed to pot grown wheat plants since the tillering stage the stress levels of intermediately stressed treatment were set following a previous study fang et al 2017 the permanent wilting point for the mixed soils was about 16 2 of the pc thus 30 pc was very close to the permanent wilting point and was set as the severely stressed level the soil water content was controlled gravimetrically by weighing and supplying water to the top of the pots every day in the late afternoon density gradients were set geometrically with 4 32 seeds pot 1

seeds pot 1 were replicated 5 times and the others were replicated 3 times 2 1 2 field experiment dryland wheat longchun29 was selected as a material in the field study during 2017 and 2018 growth seasons the treatments included two irrigation regimes and seven seeding densities table 1 with each treatment of 3 replicates the plot size was 1 5 1 5 m2 and consisted of 8 rows with 20 cm spacing between rows fertilizers were applied at sowing 250 kg ha 1 n 150 kg ha 1 p205 and 1500 kg ha 1 organic fertilizer studies have suggested that a total of 60 180 mm irrigation could be favorable for wheat population production in semi arid regions wen et al 2017 the average precipitation during wheat growth season from march to july in yuzhong was about 200 mm in the last decade a previous study in the same study site applied irrigation with 140 mm of water in total at early tillering heading flowering and during grain filling song et al 2009 however it was indicated that the water stress could be relatively allowed before jointing and after filling stage and should be avoided from jointing stage to heading period zhang et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 these evidences suggested that irrigation should be applied in jointing and heading stages thus irrigation equal to 50 mm of precipitation was applied to supplemental irrigation groups by the means of sprinkling irrigation at jointing stage and heading stage respectively no irrigation was applied to rain fed groups during the wheat growing season a gap of 10 m between supplemental irrigation groups and rain fed groups was set in order to avoid interference 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 pot culture experiment in growth chamber the soil water content was measured gravimetrically with an electronic scale and the daily water consumptions were recorded total water consumptions of each pot were calculated as the summation of daily water consumptions from sowing to maturity water use efficiencies for aboveground biomass wuea and grain yield wueg were calculated as the ratio of total aboveground biomass to total water consumptions after maturity wheat plants were harvested and allowed for natural withering for a month before measurements in pots with densities lower than 4 seeds pot 1 all the plants were labeled while 5 plants were randomly selected and labeled in pots with densities higher than 8 seeds pot 1 the individual aboveground biomass body size and grain mass of each labeled plant were measured with a balance accuracy of 0 001 g for calculating the population biomass and grain yield the unlabeled plants were also measured for their aboveground biomass and grain mass 2 2 2 field experiment at maturity all plants of 0 5 0 5 m2 in each plot were collected for determining the survival density aboveground biomass and population grain yield for each plot 10 15 plants were randomly selected and labeled for determining individual grain weight and individual aboveground mass 2 3 model deduction the law of constant final yield assumed that biomass density relation is asymptotic taking biomass accumulation as the reaction and density as the concentration of catalyst the michaelis menten equation could be rewritten as eqs 1 and 2 weiner and freckleton 2010 1 f n y m n n k 2 f n y m 1 n k where f n and f n represent the population grain yield and the individual grain yield respectively the independent variable n is the population density parameters ym is the maximum biomass that could be attained and k is the density producing half of the maximum biomass the scaling relation between grain yield and body size is shown in eq 3 3 g n β f n α where g n represents the individual grain yield α is the scaling exponent and β is the allometric coefficient when f n in eq 2 was substituted into eq 3 it gets the individual grain yield eq 4 4 g n β f n α β y m 1 n k α multiplying eq 4 with density n gets the population grain yield 5 g n β y m α n 1 n k α eq 5 is a continuous derivable function as it is composed of two simple functions function 6 is the derivative of function 5 6 g n β y m α 1 n k α α n n k α 1 when eq 6 equals 0 the correspondent n is the density producing the extremum of grain yield ne as g n is positive when n ne and negative when n ne so the curve of eq 5 is parabolic thus ne is the optimum population density nopd 7 n o p d k α 1 as was cited in eq 1 and eq 2 k is the density producing half of the maximum biomass in drought stress environments more plants would be needed to occupy all the space due to the decrease in body size and accordingly the corresponding density producing half of the maximum biomass k would be higher it has been reported in a previous study that the scaling exponents α of grain yield vs body size allometric relations in wheat was increased as a result of drought stress lv et al 2019 according to eq 7 the increases in the two parameters have contrary influences on nopd thus the variations of both parameters become critical and it is not clear whether drought stress changes nopd however biomass density relations not in agreement with the law of constant final yield were also reported deng et al 2006 2012 willey and heath 1969 so we expanded eq 7 to fulfill other patterns of biomass density relations premising the formula of biomass density relations were unknown 8 n o p d f n α f n where n f n and f n represent population density individual biomass and derivative of individual biomass respectively when the biomass density relation is parabolic quadratic function is used to simulate biomass density relations and the corresponding nopd is shown in eq 9 9 n o p d 2 a α 1 in eq 9 where a is the symmetrical axis of the quadratic function 2 4 statistical analysis allometric relations of grain yield vs body size were analyzed by using the smatr software warton et al 2012 non linear regression analyses were done with sigmaplot 13 0 systat software inc san jose ca software packages comparisons between variables were performed by least significant difference lsd method at the 0 05 and 0 01 levels of probability using spss 19 0 software spss chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 severe drought stress decreased n opd of pot grown dryland wheats the grain yield of monkhead fig 1a and longchun8275 fig 1b were affected by sowing rates which was simultaneously affected by density in a parabolic pattern at the scale of population non linear regression analyses of quadratic functions were performed to determine the yield density relations according to the results of non linear regression analyses table 2 the optimum population densities nopd were comparable between well watered ww and intermediate drought stress is groups in both wheat cultivars however the nopd of monkhead cultivar was lowered from 589 plants m 2 in well watered ww plants to 128 plants m 2 in severely stressed ss plants and that of longchun8275 was lowered from 589 plants m 2 to 316 plants m 2 accordingly thus the nopd was decreased under severe drought stress particularly two wheat cultivars shared a similar trend 3 2 variations in the biomass density relations of pot grown dryland wheats in response to drought stress as density increased the population biomass of cultivar monkhead fig 2a and longchun8275 fig 2b increased rapidly and achieved a constant maximum value at high densities totally the population biomass density relations appeared to be asymptotic the individual biomass of cultivar monkhead fig 2c and longchun8275 fig 2d was decreased with the increasing planting densities these results indicated that the biomass density relations of pot grown wheat conformed to the law of constant final yield thus eqs 1 and 2 were used to elucidate the population biomass density relations and individual biomass density relations respectively nonlinear regression analyses calculated the density producing half of the maximum biomass model parameter k of both cultivars under different water regimes the comparisons between ww and is indicated that the density producing half of the maximum biomass was not significantly affected in old landrace monkhead 50 6 vs 51 3 p 0 05 while it turned to increase significantly in longchun8275 under is 53 5 vs 84 0 p 0 01 for the comparisons between ww and ss groups the densities producing half of the maximum biomass were significantly elevated in both cultivars under ss condition monkhead 50 6 vs 131 5 longchun8275 53 5 vs 86 0 p 0 01 therefore the results suggested that drought stress tended to increase the density producing half of the maximum biomass implying that there would require more plants to occupy space and resources to maximize biomass production 3 3 variations in the scaling relations between grain yield and body size in pot grown dryland wheats in response to drought stress allometric relations between grain yield and body size aboveground biomass were analyzed in two wheat cultivars in view of the fact that allometric relations showed a plasticity in response to plant competition wheat populations were divided into two groups i e crowded populations 64 256 seeds pot 1 and uncrowded populations 1 32 seeds pot 1 respectively in general the scaling exponents α across all the treatments were significantly higher than 1 indicating that large individuals in plant population would allocate more proportion of biomass into the grains than small ones fig 3 regardless of wheat genotypes high densities significantly increased the scaling exponents of grain yield vs body size across three water regimes in the landrace monkhead the comparisons among water treatments indicated that the scaling exponent of crowded populations was significantly increased from 1 29 in ww treated plants fig 3a to 1 78 in is treated plants fig 3c and further to 2 73 in ss treated plants fig 3e while in the uncrowded groups only the scaling exponent in ss treated plants was significantly increased especially the changing trend of scaling exponents in modern cultivar longchun8275 were similar as that of monkhead the scaling exponent in the crowed populations was increased from 1 40 in ww treated plants fig 3b to 1 92 in the is treated plants fig 3d and further to 3 02 in ss treated plants fig 3f moreover the scaling exponent of uncrowded populations was significantly higher in the is and ss treated plants than that of ww treated plants in summary the scaling exponents of the allometric relations between grain yield and body size were significantly increased as a result of drought stress 3 4 yield density relations in response to planting densities and water regimes under the field condition to verify the reliability and adaptation of above results under the pot culture condition we conducted a comparative field experiment firstly the precipitation data differed from growing seasons according to weather data the year 2018 was relatively humid due to its annual precipitations of up to 444 6 mm and in growing season precipitation of 230 6 mm from march to july compared with 409 9 mm and 189 5 mm in 2017 respectively fig a secondly rather than being asymptotic the biomass density relations in field condition turned to be parabolic fig 4a and b according to the simulation result the quadratic function showed a higher goodness of fit for the biomass density relations in field condition relative to pot culture condition the coefficient of determination r 2 of all the simulated curves were totally greater than 0 90 regardless of growing seasons the symmetrical axis a of the simulated quadratic function were not statistically different from wheat populations grown in the rain fed and supplemental irrigation conditions thirdly quadratic function was also used to simulate the relations between grain yield and planting density the results indicated that the nopd was numerically greater under the irrigation condition than that of the rain fed condition in 2017 growing season the nopd was identified as 426 plants m 2 under the irrigation condition and 288 plants m 2 under rain fed condition respectively fig 4c while in 2018 growing season it was 562 plants m 2 and 468 plants m 2 respectively fig 4d as indicated in the above two growth environments shared a similar trend in that there existed a decreasing trend of nopd under drought stress in pot culture and field conditions finally the scaling relations between grain yield and body size were also analyzed across two growing seasons a general trend was that the scaling exponents of grain yield vs body size were significantly higher than 1 in all treatments p 0 01 and there was similar tendency in both growing seasons regardless of growing seasons the scaling exponents under the rain fed condition were significantly higher than those under the irrigation condition fig 5a in 2017 1 118 vs 1 024 n 210 p 0 01 fig 5b in 2018 1 169 vs 1 100 n 315 p 0 01 3 5 the mechanism of lower optimum population density under drought stress to explore the mechanism on the decreased nopd as affected by drought stress we established an updated mathematical model incorporating with two major ecological relations the biomass density relation and the allometric relation in eq 7 the nopd was positively associated with the density producing half of the maximum biomass and negatively with the scaling exponent respectively the parameter k representing the density producing half of the maximum biomass was set as the y axis and the parameter α 1 derived from scaling exponent was set as the x axis in which the slopes was equal to nopd comparing to ww treated monkhead plants the value of α 1 increased by 14 in is treated plants and 314 in ss treated plants respectively fig 3a c and e while the value of k increased by only 1 in is treated plants and 160 in ss treated plants respectively fig 2c it was noted that similar trends were also observed in cultivar longchun8275 the value of α 1 increased from 0 05 in ww treated plants to 0 14 in is treated plants increased by 180 and further to 0 54 in ss treated plants increased by 980 fig 3b d and f in longchun8275 while the value of k increased by only 57 in is treated plants and 61 in ss treated plants respectively fig 2d the experimentally derived parameters indicated that the increase in k could not catch up with the increase in α 1 which resulted in the decreased nopd under drought stress fig 6a and b particularly the parameters harvested from field experiment were analyzed in the same way according to eq 9 when the part related to the scaling exponent α 1 increased significantly the axis of asymmetry a remained relatively stable in response to drought stress in which the nopd was decreased in 2017 season fig 6c and 2018 season respectively fig 6d in summary the allometric relations between grain yield and body size were plastic in response to soil water availability and the scaling exponent were increased this phenomenon accounted for the reason why nopd was decreased 4 discussion 4 1 the dynamics of nopd in response to drought stress as presented in the above the quadratic function simulation results demonstrated that ss reduced the nopd under the pot culture condition regardless of wheat genotypes fig 1a b when it came to field condition the nopd was also lowered in rain fed condition fig 4c d similar phenomenon was also observed by anderson anderson 1986 in which the nopd of wheat was reduced from 462 seeds m 2 in 1981 1982 growing season wet season to 141 seeds m 2 in 1982 1983 growing season dry season in the rain fed agricultural region of the loess plateau wheat cultivar changwu135 showed lower nopd in dry year relative to wet year 245 vs 371 plants m 2 fang et al 2010 besides it was also reported that the nopd was positively associated with the in season precipitation amount anderson et al 2004 however there existed exceptional report against the above tendency due to terminal drought in montana usa in 2005 wheat cultivar mcneal displayed a higher nopd than normal year chen et al 2008 in the study of chen et al 2008 the higher nopd might be a result of the positive interaction provoked by terminal stress as is well known terminal drought can cause significant yield loss which frequently erases the differences in yield among the treatments of planting densities also the stress gradient hypothesis assumes that the positive interaction would be preponderant under terminal stress callaway and walker 1997 which could alleviate stress and improve growth in high densities in normal years differentiate planting densities can play a major role in affecting final yield formation in dryland crops other studies presented a decreasing trend in the nopd of dryland wheat in response to drought stress conditions tokatlidis 2014 the present finding also showed a decrease of nopd in both pot culture fig 1 and table 2 and field conditions fig 4 4 2 model assumptions in order to explore a generalized model regarding the observational trend we employed the methodology and knowledge of classic ecological theory to further analyze the harvested data in present study the deduced model was briefly characterized by asymptotic trend of biomass accumulation and allometry of grain allocation two assumptions were involved in the deduction processes as to simplify the equations firstly scaling exponent was assumed to be relatively constant across a small range of densities which actually never took place in real environments in most cases plant allocation patterns were size dependent weiner 2004 and the size dependency of biomass allocation was termed as passive plasticity wright and mcconnaughay 2002 or apparent plasticity mcconnaughay and coleman 1999 meanwhile the plasticity provoked by the environmental factor apart from the size effect was defined as true plasticity weiner 2004 generally the apparent plasticity would not change the scaling exponents while true plasticity could significantly affect the scaling exponents as the competition was a provoker of true plasticity in dryland wheat weiner 2004 weiner and thomas 1992 it was likely to divide wheat populations of pot cultured plants into the crowded and uncrowded groups in order to lessen the errors in scaling exponents specifically the eqs 4 and 5 presented the process of calculating total grain yield from the mathematical average value of body size individual aboveground biomass actually all the plant individuals in a specific population under a certain density were not uniform and there existed a phenomenon of size inequality pan et al 2003 rasmussen and weiner 2017 in present model the trend was calculated using the average values of body size across the densities and water regimes in this aspect the variation of nopd due to inequality in body size was ignored 4 3 ecological significance of the model and the mechanism underlying the lower n opd under drought stress according to eq 7 the density producing half of maximum biomass k and the scaling exponent of grain mass vs body size allometric relation α were used to determine the value of nopd it clearly showed that biomass accumulation tended to rise up to a maximum value at high densities fig 2 indicating the biomass density relations in the pot culture condition was in accordance with the law of constant final yield according to the assumption in eq 1 plant biomass accumulation was taken as an indicator of resources acquisition weiner and freckleton 2010 thus the density producing half of the maximum biomass would serve as a critical variable to exhibit the resources acquisition ability of a certain population for maximizing biomass output under a specific density hence when body size was decreased in drought stressed environment it would need more plants to occupy space and resources to maximize biomass production west et al 2009 importantly the density producing half of the maximum biomass would increase under drought stress and this phenomenon was confirmed in the present study fig 2 on the other hand the significant allometric scaling exponent α 1 indicated that the large plants would allocate more proportion of biomass to grain production than the small ones lv et al 2019 found that there was an increase in the scaling exponents of grain yield vs body size allometric relations under drought stress which was also confirmed by the present study in both pot culture and field conditions figs 3 and 5 this demonstrated that the biomass allocation into grain was mainly size dependent and significantly affected by drought stress at the same body size large plants had comparable allocation ratios to grain in different water treatments e g the constraint of hi was about 0 60 in pot grown wheats in different environments hence the increased scaling exponent indicated that small plants were less reproductive in drought stressed environment than those of the same size in well watered condition as affected by drought stress the increase in the scaling exponent would exert negative effects on the formation of nopd if incorporating the parameters obtained from pot culture experiment into eq 7 there indicated a decreased nopd in dryland wheats under drought stress fig 6a b this trend implied that the increased scaling exponent became a major factor to result in the decreased nopd under drought stress previous studies demonstrated that body size allometry accounted for most of the variations in grain production while environmental factors plasticity accounted for only a small proportion of variations less than 5 eziz et al 2017 müller et al 2000 the plasticity still could be important in crop population production the present study indicated that the plasticity increased scaling exponent provoked by drought stress significantly modified the yield density relations and decreased the nopd for maximum grain yield particularly the field observations presented a lower nopd fig 4 and significantly higher scaling exponent of grain yield vs body size allometric relations fig 5 which was similar as the results from the pot culture experiment however the biomass density relations did not follow the law of constant final yield in the field experiment it was reported that the biomass density relations could be parabolic or even piecewise deng et al 2006 2012 in our model the reported relations were not applicable particularly since the piecewise biomass density relations were not continuous however the discontinuous biomass density curve could be divided into two continuous biomass density sub curves in this case the general form of model eq 8 could be applicable in view of the fact that the biomass density relations under the field condition were parabolic fig 4 the quadratic function could be used to simulate the biomass density relations and the nopd model as indicated in eq 9 therefore the nopd of field grown wheat was also decreased as a result of the increased scaling exponent of grain yield vs body size allometric relations conclusively the allometric relations were plastic in response to drought stress and the plasticity of allometric relations thus resulted in the decreased nopd a schematic diagram was drafted to present the influences of drought stress on yield density relations and nopd dynamics according to the model in drought stressed environment plant individuals were relatively small in body size hence achieving maximum biomass output required more individuals to occupy space and other resources however to some extent this trend generally aggravated the intra specific competition to capture soil water resulting in relatively low harvest index hi in small plant individuals comparing with those individuals of the same size in well watered condition fig 7a in this case the low hi in small individuals under drought stressed condition would be the major factor increasing the scaling exponent fig 7b consequently the population density tended to be lowered and partially sacrifice the resources acquisition ability to achieve maximum grain yield fig 7d some reports have documented that reciprocal equations were more biologically appropriate for simulating the yield density relationship than the symmetric quadratic functions ellis et al 2010 yahuza 2011 from this perspective eq 5 was a reciprocal function to predict the asymmetric yield density relationship that passed through the origin fig 7c 4 4 water productivity in pot culture and field experiments water productivity was another critical agronomic parameter to account for the models in this study it was reported that moderate water stress could improve wuea of dryland wheat under field condition du et al 2010 but in our pot culture experiment water use efficiency for aboveground biomass wuea was the highest in the ss treatments under medium and high plant densities 16 256 plants m 2 followed by the is ones fig b p 0 05 nonetheless the wue for grain yield wueg appeared to be the lowest in the ss treatments across most densities while the is ones were observed to have equal or higher wueg than that in ww ones fig b p 0 05 this phenomenon was in agreement with previous studies du et al 2010 zhang et al 1998 in this study water productivity was more pronounced in the is group the ratio of increased grain weight to increased water use was 1 49 on average of all the densities from is treated plants to ss treated plants while it was 1 24 from ww treated plants to ss treated plants under the field condition the yield improvement effect due to supplemental irrigation was also more pronounced in the dry 2017 growing season it was up to 35 2 on average across different plant densities but only 17 0 in 2018 season this tendency conformed to previous study in northwest china dong et al 2011 thus the irrigation was more helpful to improve yield production of dryland wheat in drier environment under the condition of low water availability the lower densities were beneficial to alleviate water competition among wheat individuals this enabled the small individuals in the majority of the population to elevate the reproductive allocation which turned to improve population yield accordingly 5 conclusion the relationship between population density and reproductive output has been widely observed in higher plant however its ecological mechanism underlying the maximum yield output is not available particularly when water is a sole limiting factor in view of the role of nopd in dryland wheat the observations from pot culture and field experiments achieved basically similar results according to the simulation of quadratic function the nopd of two cultivars in the ss treated condition was decreased by 78 3 and 46 3 respectively compared with those of ww treated condition across wheat genotypes and water treatments the michaelis menten equation presented a high goodness of fit r 2 0 85 p 0 01 in the biomass density relations to explore the mechanism underlying the reduction of nopd under drought stress the mathematical models based on the law of constant final yield and the allometric scaling between grain yield vs body size were performed the model indicated that the nopd was positively associated with the density producing half of maximum biomass but negatively with the scaling exponent of allometric relation in such case the decreased nopd resulted from the significantly increased scaling exponent in both wheat cultivars under drought stress under field condition the nopd was numerically lower in rain fed condition than that of supplemental irrigated condition therefore it can be argued that the scaling exponents of grain yield vs body size allometric relations were increased as a result of drought stress this trend can be responsible for the reduction of nopd in dryland wheat for the first time we verified the hypothesis that drought stress decreased optimum population density for maximum grain yield in dryland wheat using the method of ecological modeling our results suggested that population density of wheat be lower in dry environment rain fed condition than normal irrigated dose for maximizing population yield under the field condition supplementary irrigation in drier seasons could increase the nopd so as to avoid yield loss in semiarid rain fed agricultural region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

9898,the rational close planting in agricultural production is an old topic yet it is so far unclear whether the optimum population density nopd is dependent on soil water availability and its mechanism in dryland crops to address this issue we established a mathematical model of nopd dynamics under soil moisture gradients and performed a modeling verification from laboratory to field using wheat as testing material in pot culture experiment with 3 moisture gradients and 9 planting densities the quadratic function fitting of yield density relation indicated that old landrace and modern cultivar shared a similar increasing trend of nopd in response to soil water availability the biomass density relation displayed a typical mode of asymptotical line and conformed to the law of constant final yield we therefore established a classic equation of nopd k α 1 via adopting the scaling exponent α between grain yield and body size aboveground biomass and the density producing half of maximum biomass k with the increasing drought stress the increasing extent of k was evidently lower than α 1 suggesting that the nopd decreased along with increasing drought stress to verify the above model we therefore performed a field experiment and found that the nopd under the rain fed condition no irrigation was lowered by 32 4 in 2017 and 16 7 in 2018 respectively compared to that of supplemental irrigation interestingly the biomass density relationship was parabolic under field condition which could be well fitted by quadratic function we thus established an improved model of nopd 2 a α 1 where a referred to the symmetrical axis of biomass density quadratic function and remained relatively stable regardless of soil moisture since the α became significantly greater under the rain fed condition p 0 05 the nopd was lowered by drought stress our findings highlighted a critical role of the plastic allometric relations to affect the nopd dynamics suggesting that lower seeding density would be more favorable for field production of wheats in dry environment keywords drought stress optimum population density nopd law of constant final yield yield biomass density relation dryland wheat modeling verification 1 introduction the rational close planting in agricultural production could maximize economic yield anderson et al 2004 tokatlidis 2014 willey and heath 1969 in agricultural systems the low planting densities do not enable crops to make full utilization of space and resources while the higher densities also frequently result in establishment loss and reproductive failure liu et al 2008 existing investigations showed that higher sowing rates can increase stand density and intra speciﬁc competition among plants resulting in higher plant mortality pickard 1984 therefore both high and low seeding rates are unfavorable for yield maximization as early as in 1940 s quadratic function simulation has been used to study the relationships between yield and plant density hudson 1941 quadratic function is a continuous function with a parabolic curve which is symmetrical about the maximum value of yield besides the curvature of the curve can significantly vary from growth environments and crop genotypes when the quadratic function is used to simulate the yield density relations these features enable the quadratic function simulation to be an accurate and simple method for investigating yield density relationship and estimating optimum population density of high yield nopd willey and heath 1969 yahuza 2011 this method has been used in many previous studies chen et al 2008 fischer et al 2019 tokatlidis 2014 by simulating with quadratic functions the maize hybrids released at different eras displayed differentiate nopd sangoi et al 2002 similar studies were also reported in other grain crops such as grain sorghum myers and foale 1981 wheat anderson 1986 chen et al 2008 and legumes gan et al 2003 however this method has frequently met the restriction in evaluating the interaction between crop yield and plant density for example the symmetry nature of quadratic function could limit the simulation accuracy under high and low plant densities willey and heath 1969 also the parameters in quadratic function are thought to lack ecological or biological significance yahuza 2011 as a critical abiotic limiting factor alqudah et al 2011 chai et al 2015 drought stress plays a decisive effect on the formation of nopd in dryland wheat previous agronomic studies suggested that the nopd of dryland wheat was decreased under drought stress anderson et al 2004 cima et al 2004 fang et al 2010 the nopd was positively associated with rainfall amount tokatlidis 2014 yet the ecological implications underlying such phenomenon still remain unclear in general yield formation is frequently affected by aboveground biomass and harvest index hi therefore the deduced yield biomass density relations play a significant role in understanding the mechanism of the density dependent yield formation under drought stress generally aboveground biomass accumulation is a crucial factor that significantly affects yield formation richards et al 2019 to most extent the biomass density relation can quantitatively account for the yield density relation the theory of population ecology shows that there are generally three types of biomass density relations including self thinning in crowded population interspecific scaling and simple biomass density relation at a given time weiner and freckleton 2010 in most cases much attention has been paid on the first two types of relations enquist et al 1998 yet the importance of simple yield density relations at a specific time has not been fully studied weiner and freckleton 2010 in this regard a widely used theory is the law of constant final yield this law defines that biomass accumulation would become constant at relatively high densities farazdaghi and harris 1968 when incorporating the law of constant finial yield into the michaelis menten equation the analyses on biomass accumulation dynamics would be widely applicable the new equation can depict the law of constant final yield in the simplest way interestingly in case the total biomass accumulation is viewed as a chemical reaction the planting density can be taken as its catalytic agent weiner and freckleton 2010 another important factor determining the yield is harvest index hi which is defined as the ratio of grain yield to aboveground biomass body size however the hi may change in response to the plant density and drought stress as grain allocation is highly size dependent in general the grain yield of plants is mainly decided by body size eziz et al 2017 müller et al 2000 and the size dependent allocation is popular in seed plants which is termed as the allometric allocation or apparent plasticity mcconnaughay and coleman 1999 but some researchers also suggest that a small proportion of variations in grain yield are due to environmental factors which could be important in population production weiner 2004 weiner et al 2009 in this circumstance the allometric allocation trajectory could be modified by environmental factors i e so called true plasticity weiner 2004 in the field of metabolic theory the term allometry is referred to as the apparent plasticity and the term plasticity as the true plasticity with regard to the allometric allocation relations drought stress is frequently viewed as a provoker of plasticity in dryland wheat lv et al 2019 xu et al 2010 however it remains unclear how the population grain production and the yield density relations are affected by the plasticity provoked by drought stress since the hi is defined as the proportion of grain mass into aboveground biomass the plasticity provoked by drought stress may result in the changes in yield density relations as well as the nopd on the basis of above descriptions we therefore hypothesize that the plasticity in allometric allocation relations between grain yield and aboveground biomass would be responsible for the decreased nopd under drought stress to verify this hypothesis a mathematical model was established and verified in pot culture and field experiments the major objectives of this study were designed as follows 1 to determine the dynamics of biomass accumulation in response to planting densities and soil water availability from laboratory to field 2 to investigate how the nopd of dryland wheat responds to drought stress and if there exists a difference in the wheat cultivars released at different eras 3 to verify the reliability and adaptability of above results in rain fed field condition using an updated biomass yield density model and 4 to explore the ecological mechanism underlying the changed nopd under drought stress 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and experimental design 2 1 1 pot culture experiment in growth chamber dryland hexaploidy wheat cultivars monkhead and longchun8275 bred at different eras in the northwest rain fed regions of china were chosen as the materials monkhead was popularly planted in the northwest of china from 1940s to 1970s while the newly released cultivar longchun8275 was popular since the 1990s the monkhead was awnless and highly tillering while the awned longchun8275 had less tillers song et al 2009 zhu and zhang 2013 the experiment was carried out in the growth chamber in the yuzhong campus 35 56 n 104 09 e of lanzhou university during 2016 growth season the pots were cylindrical with 0 2 m diameter and 0 3 m height each pot was filled with 6 5 kg of loessial soil mixed with vermiculite v v 2 1 and the height of the fill inside the pots was about 0 25 m the mixed soils used for pot culture experiment had a pot capacity pc turner 2019 of 31 5 and a permanent wilting point of 5 1 nutrient solution containing 3 64 g of nh4no3 and 1 48 g of kh2po4 was applied to each pot before sowing before imposing drought stress the pots were kept adequately watered 80 pc and allowed to dehydrate gradually water treatments including well watered ww 80 pc intermediately stressed is 55 pc and severely stressed ss 30 pc were imposed to pot grown wheat plants since the tillering stage the stress levels of intermediately stressed treatment were set following a previous study fang et al 2017 the permanent wilting point for the mixed soils was about 16 2 of the pc thus 30 pc was very close to the permanent wilting point and was set as the severely stressed level the soil water content was controlled gravimetrically by weighing and supplying water to the top of the pots every day in the late afternoon density gradients were set geometrically with 4 32 seeds pot 1 approximating normal field densities about 100 800 seeds m 2 1 2 seeds pot 1 and 64 256 seeds pot 1 representing extremely low and high densities respectively table 1 pots with densities lower than 4 seeds pot 1 were replicated 5 times and the others were replicated 3 times 2 1 2 field experiment dryland wheat longchun29 was selected as a material in the field study during 2017 and 2018 growth seasons the treatments included two irrigation regimes and seven seeding densities table 1 with each treatment of 3 replicates the plot size was 1 5 1 5 m2 and consisted of 8 rows with 20 cm spacing between rows fertilizers were applied at sowing 250 kg ha 1 n 150 kg ha 1 p205 and 1500 kg ha 1 organic fertilizer studies have suggested that a total of 60 180 mm irrigation could be favorable for wheat population production in semi arid regions wen et al 2017 the average precipitation during wheat growth season from march to july in yuzhong was about 200 mm in the last decade a previous study in the same study site applied irrigation with 140 mm of water in total at early tillering heading flowering and during grain filling song et al 2009 however it was indicated that the water stress could be relatively allowed before jointing and after filling stage and should be avoided from jointing stage to heading period zhang et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 these evidences suggested that irrigation should be applied in jointing and heading stages thus irrigation equal to 50 mm of precipitation was applied to supplemental irrigation groups by the means of sprinkling irrigation at jointing stage and heading stage respectively no irrigation was applied to rain fed groups during the wheat growing season a gap of 10 m between supplemental irrigation groups and rain fed groups was set in order to avoid interference 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 pot culture experiment in growth chamber the soil water content was measured gravimetrically with an electronic scale and the daily water consumptions were recorded total water consumptions of each pot were calculated as the summation of daily water consumptions from sowing to maturity water use efficiencies for aboveground biomass wuea and grain yield wueg were calculated as the ratio of total aboveground biomass to total water consumptions after maturity wheat plants were harvested and allowed for natural withering for a month before measurements in pots with densities lower than 4 seeds pot 1 all the plants were labeled while 5 plants were randomly selected and labeled in pots with densities higher than 8 seeds pot 1 the individual aboveground biomass body size and grain mass of each labeled plant were measured with a balance accuracy of 0 001 g for calculating the population biomass and grain yield the unlabeled plants were also measured for their aboveground biomass and grain mass 2 2 2 field experiment at maturity all plants of 0 5 0 5 m2 in each plot were collected for determining the survival density aboveground biomass and population grain yield for each plot 10 15 plants were randomly selected and labeled for determining individual grain weight and individual aboveground mass 2 3 model deduction the law of constant final yield assumed that biomass density relation is asymptotic taking biomass accumulation as the reaction and density as the concentration of catalyst the michaelis menten equation could be rewritten as eqs 1 and 2 weiner and freckleton 2010 1 f n y m n n k 2 f n y m 1 n k where f n and f n represent the population grain yield and the individual grain yield respectively the independent variable n is the population density parameters ym is the maximum biomass that could be attained and k is the density producing half of the maximum biomass the scaling relation between grain yield and body size is shown in eq 3 3 g n β f n α where g n represents the individual grain yield α is the scaling exponent and β is the allometric coefficient when f n in eq 2 was substituted into eq 3 it gets the individual grain yield eq 4 4 g n β f n α β y m 1 n k α multiplying eq 4 with density n gets the population grain yield 5 g n β y m α n 1 n k α eq 5 is a continuous derivable function as it is composed of two simple functions function 6 is the derivative of function 5 6 g n β y m α 1 n k α α n n k α 1 when eq 6 equals 0 the correspondent n is the density producing the extremum of grain yield ne as g n is positive when n ne and negative when n ne so the curve of eq 5 is parabolic thus ne is the optimum population density nopd 7 n o p d k α 1 as was cited in eq 1 and eq 2 k is the density producing half of the maximum biomass in drought stress environments more plants would be needed to occupy all the space due to the decrease in body size and accordingly the corresponding density producing half of the maximum biomass k would be higher it has been reported in a previous study that the scaling exponents α of grain yield vs body size allometric relations in wheat was increased as a result of drought stress lv et al 2019 according to eq 7 the increases in the two parameters have contrary influences on nopd thus the variations of both parameters become critical and it is not clear whether drought stress changes nopd however biomass density relations not in agreement with the law of constant final yield were also reported deng et al 2006 2012 willey and heath 1969 so we expanded eq 7 to fulfill other patterns of biomass density relations premising the formula of biomass density relations were unknown 8 n o p d f n α f n where n f n and f n represent population density individual biomass and derivative of individual biomass respectively when the biomass density relation is parabolic quadratic function is used to simulate biomass density relations and the corresponding nopd is shown in eq 9 9 n o p d 2 a α 1 in eq 9 where a is the symmetrical axis of the quadratic function 2 4 statistical analysis allometric relations of grain yield vs body size were analyzed by using the smatr software warton et al 2012 non linear regression analyses were done with sigmaplot 13 0 systat software inc san jose ca software packages comparisons between variables were performed by least significant difference lsd method at the 0 05 and 0 01 levels of probability using spss 19 0 software spss chicago il usa 3 results 3 1 severe drought stress decreased n opd of pot grown dryland wheats the grain yield of monkhead fig 1a and longchun8275 fig 1b were affected by sowing rates which was simultaneously affected by density in a parabolic pattern at the scale of population non linear regression analyses of quadratic functions were performed to determine the yield density relations according to the results of non linear regression analyses table 2 the optimum population densities nopd were comparable between well watered ww and intermediate drought stress is groups in both wheat cultivars however the nopd of monkhead cultivar was lowered from 589 plants m 2 in well watered ww plants to 128 plants m 2 in severely stressed ss plants and that of longchun8275 was lowered from 589 plants m 2 to 316 plants m 2 accordingly thus the nopd was decreased under severe drought stress particularly two wheat cultivars shared a similar trend 3 2 variations in the biomass density relations of pot grown dryland wheats in response to drought stress as density increased the population biomass of cultivar monkhead fig 2a and longchun8275 fig 2b increased rapidly and achieved a constant maximum value at high densities totally the population biomass density relations appeared to be asymptotic the individual biomass of cultivar monkhead fig 2c and longchun8275 fig 2d was decreased with the increasing planting densities these results indicated that the biomass density relations of pot grown wheat conformed to the law of constant final yield thus eqs 1 and 2 were used to elucidate the population biomass density relations and individual biomass density relations respectively nonlinear regression analyses calculated the density producing half of the maximum biomass model parameter k of both cultivars under different water regimes the comparisons between ww and is indicated that the density producing half of the maximum biomass was not significantly affected in old landrace monkhead 50 6 vs 51 3 p 0 05 while it turned to increase significantly in longchun8275 under is 53 5 vs 84 0 p 0 01 for the comparisons between ww and ss groups the densities producing half of the maximum biomass were significantly elevated in both cultivars under ss condition monkhead 50 6 vs 131 5 longchun8275 53 5 vs 86 0 p 0 01 therefore the results suggested that drought stress tended to increase the density producing half of the maximum biomass implying that there would require more plants to occupy space and resources to maximize biomass production 3 3 variations in the scaling relations between grain yield and body size in pot grown dryland wheats in response to drought stress allometric relations between grain yield and body size aboveground biomass were analyzed in two wheat cultivars in view of the fact that allometric relations showed a plasticity in response to plant competition wheat populations were divided into two groups i e crowded populations 64 256 seeds pot 1 and uncrowded populations 1 32 seeds pot 1 respectively in general the scaling exponents α across all the treatments were significantly higher than 1 indicating that large individuals in plant population would allocate more proportion of biomass into the grains than small ones fig 3 regardless of wheat genotypes high densities significantly increased the scaling exponents of grain yield vs body size across three water regimes in the landrace monkhead the comparisons among water treatments indicated that the scaling exponent of crowded populations was significantly increased from 1 29 in ww treated plants fig 3a to 1 78 in is treated plants fig 3c and further to 2 73 in ss treated plants fig 3e while in the uncrowded groups only the scaling exponent in ss treated plants was significantly increased especially the changing trend of scaling exponents in modern cultivar longchun8275 were similar as that of monkhead the scaling exponent in the crowed populations was increased from 1 40 in ww treated plants fig 3b to 1 92 in the is treated plants fig 3d and further to 3 02 in ss treated plants fig 3f moreover the scaling exponent of uncrowded populations was significantly higher in the is and ss treated plants than that of ww treated plants in summary the scaling exponents of the allometric relations between grain yield and body size were significantly increased as a result of drought stress 3 4 yield density relations in response to planting densities and water regimes under the field condition to verify the reliability and adaptation of above results under the pot culture condition we conducted a comparative field experiment firstly the precipitation data differed from growing seasons according to weather data the year 2018 was relatively humid due to its annual precipitations of up to 444 6 mm and in growing season precipitation of 230 6 mm from march to july compared with 409 9 mm and 189 5 mm in 2017 respectively fig a secondly rather than being asymptotic the biomass density relations in field condition turned to be parabolic fig 4a and b according to the simulation result the quadratic function showed a higher goodness of fit for the biomass density relations in field condition relative to pot culture condition the coefficient of determination r 2 of all the simulated curves were totally greater than 0 90 regardless of growing seasons the symmetrical axis a of the simulated quadratic function were not statistically different from wheat populations grown in the rain fed and supplemental irrigation conditions thirdly quadratic function was also used to simulate the relations between grain yield and planting density the results indicated that the nopd was numerically greater under the irrigation condition than that of the rain fed condition in 2017 growing season the nopd was identified as 426 plants m 2 under the irrigation condition and 288 plants m 2 under rain fed condition respectively fig 4c while in 2018 growing season it was 562 plants m 2 and 468 plants m 2 respectively fig 4d as indicated in the above two growth environments shared a similar trend in that there existed a decreasing trend of nopd under drought stress in pot culture and field conditions finally the scaling relations between grain yield and body size were also analyzed across two growing seasons a general trend was that the scaling exponents of grain yield vs body size were significantly higher than 1 in all treatments p 0 01 and there was similar tendency in both growing seasons regardless of growing seasons the scaling exponents under the rain fed condition were significantly higher than those under the irrigation condition fig 5a in 2017 1 118 vs 1 024 n 210 p 0 01 fig 5b in 2018 1 169 vs 1 100 n 315 p 0 01 3 5 the mechanism of lower optimum population density under drought stress to explore the mechanism on the decreased nopd as affected by drought stress we established an updated mathematical model incorporating with two major ecological relations the biomass density relation and the allometric relation in eq 7 the nopd was positively associated with the density producing half of the maximum biomass and negatively with the scaling exponent respectively the parameter k representing the density producing half of the maximum biomass was set as the y axis and the parameter α 1 derived from scaling exponent was set as the x axis in which the slopes was equal to nopd comparing to ww treated monkhead plants the value of α 1 increased by 14 in is treated plants and 314 in ss treated plants respectively fig 3a c and e while the value of k increased by only 1 in is treated plants and 160 in ss treated plants respectively fig 2c it was noted that similar trends were also observed in cultivar longchun8275 the value of α 1 increased from 0 05 in ww treated plants to 0 14 in is treated plants increased by 180 and further to 0 54 in ss treated plants increased by 980 fig 3b d and f in longchun8275 while the value of k increased by only 57 in is treated plants and 61 in ss treated plants respectively fig 2d the experimentally derived parameters indicated that the increase in k could not catch up with the increase in α 1 which resulted in the decreased nopd under drought stress fig 6a and b particularly the parameters harvested from field experiment were analyzed in the same way according to eq 9 when the part related to the scaling exponent α 1 increased significantly the axis of asymmetry a remained relatively stable in response to drought stress in which the nopd was decreased in 2017 season fig 6c and 2018 season respectively fig 6d in summary the allometric relations between grain yield and body size were plastic in response to soil water availability and the scaling exponent were increased this phenomenon accounted for the reason why nopd was decreased 4 discussion 4 1 the dynamics of nopd in response to drought stress as presented in the above the quadratic function simulation results demonstrated that ss reduced the nopd under the pot culture condition regardless of wheat genotypes fig 1a b when it came to field condition the nopd was also lowered in rain fed condition fig 4c d similar phenomenon was also observed by anderson anderson 1986 in which the nopd of wheat was reduced from 462 seeds m 2 in 1981 1982 growing season wet season to 141 seeds m 2 in 1982 1983 growing season dry season in the rain fed agricultural region of the loess plateau wheat cultivar changwu135 showed lower nopd in dry year relative to wet year 245 vs 371 plants m 2 fang et al 2010 besides it was also reported that the nopd was positively associated with the in season precipitation amount anderson et al 2004 however there existed exceptional report against the above tendency due to terminal drought in montana usa in 2005 wheat cultivar mcneal displayed a higher nopd than normal year chen et al 2008 in the study of chen et al 2008 the higher nopd might be a result of the positive interaction provoked by terminal stress as is well known terminal drought can cause significant yield loss which frequently erases the differences in yield among the treatments of planting densities also the stress gradient hypothesis assumes that the positive interaction would be preponderant under terminal stress callaway and walker 1997 which could alleviate stress and improve growth in high densities in normal years differentiate planting densities can play a major role in affecting final yield formation in dryland crops other studies presented a decreasing trend in the nopd of dryland wheat in response to drought stress conditions tokatlidis 2014 the present finding also showed a decrease of nopd in both pot culture fig 1 and table 2 and field conditions fig 4 4 2 model assumptions in order to explore a generalized model regarding the observational trend we employed the methodology and knowledge of classic ecological theory to further analyze the harvested data in present study the deduced model was briefly characterized by asymptotic trend of biomass accumulation and allometry of grain allocation two assumptions were involved in the deduction processes as to simplify the equations firstly scaling exponent was assumed to be relatively constant across a small range of densities which actually never took place in real environments in most cases plant allocation patterns were size dependent weiner 2004 and the size dependency of biomass allocation was termed as passive plasticity wright and mcconnaughay 2002 or apparent plasticity mcconnaughay and coleman 1999 meanwhile the plasticity provoked by the environmental factor apart from the size effect was defined as true plasticity weiner 2004 generally the apparent plasticity would not change the scaling exponents while true plasticity could significantly affect the scaling exponents as the competition was a provoker of true plasticity in dryland wheat weiner 2004 weiner and thomas 1992 it was likely to divide wheat populations of pot cultured plants into the crowded and uncrowded groups in order to lessen the errors in scaling exponents specifically the eqs 4 and 5 presented the process of calculating total grain yield from the mathematical average value of body size individual aboveground biomass actually all the plant individuals in a specific population under a certain density were not uniform and there existed a phenomenon of size inequality pan et al 2003 rasmussen and weiner 2017 in present model the trend was calculated using the average values of body size across the densities and water regimes in this aspect the variation of nopd due to inequality in body size was ignored 4 3 ecological significance of the model and the mechanism underlying the lower n opd under drought stress according to eq 7 the density producing half of maximum biomass k and the scaling exponent of grain mass vs body size allometric relation α were used to determine the value of nopd it clearly showed that biomass accumulation tended to rise up to a maximum value at high densities fig 2 indicating the biomass density relations in the pot culture condition was in accordance with the law of constant final yield according to the assumption in eq 1 plant biomass accumulation was taken as an indicator of resources acquisition weiner and freckleton 2010 thus the density producing half of the maximum biomass would serve as a critical variable to exhibit the resources acquisition ability of a certain population for maximizing biomass output under a specific density hence when body size was decreased in drought stressed environment it would need more plants to occupy space and resources to maximize biomass production west et al 2009 importantly the density producing half of the maximum biomass would increase under drought stress and this phenomenon was confirmed in the present study fig 2 on the other hand the significant allometric scaling exponent α 1 indicated that the large plants would allocate more proportion of biomass to grain production than the small ones lv et al 2019 found that there was an increase in the scaling exponents of grain yield vs body size allometric relations under drought stress which was also confirmed by the present study in both pot culture and field conditions figs 3 and 5 this demonstrated that the biomass allocation into grain was mainly size dependent and significantly affected by drought stress at the same body size large plants had comparable allocation ratios to grain in different water treatments e g the constraint of hi was about 0 60 in pot grown wheats in different environments hence the increased scaling exponent indicated that small plants were less reproductive in drought stressed environment than those of the same size in well watered condition as affected by drought stress the increase in the scaling exponent would exert negative effects on the formation of nopd if incorporating the parameters obtained from pot culture experiment into eq 7 there indicated a decreased nopd in dryland wheats under drought stress fig 6a b this trend implied that the increased scaling exponent became a major factor to result in the decreased nopd under drought stress previous studies demonstrated that body size allometry accounted for most of the variations in grain production while environmental factors plasticity accounted for only a small proportion of variations less than 5 eziz et al 2017 müller et al 2000 the plasticity still could be important in crop population production the present study indicated that the plasticity increased scaling exponent provoked by drought stress significantly modified the yield density relations and decreased the nopd for maximum grain yield particularly the field observations presented a lower nopd fig 4 and significantly higher scaling exponent of grain yield vs body size allometric relations fig 5 which was similar as the results from the pot culture experiment however the biomass density relations did not follow the law of constant final yield in the field experiment it was reported that the biomass density relations could be parabolic or even piecewise deng et al 2006 2012 in our model the reported relations were not applicable particularly since the piecewise biomass density relations were not continuous however the discontinuous biomass density curve could be divided into two continuous biomass density sub curves in this case the general form of model eq 8 could be applicable in view of the fact that the biomass density relations under the field condition were parabolic fig 4 the quadratic function could be used to simulate the biomass density relations and the nopd model as indicated in eq 9 therefore the nopd of field grown wheat was also decreased as a result of the increased scaling exponent of grain yield vs body size allometric relations conclusively the allometric relations were plastic in response to drought stress and the plasticity of allometric relations thus resulted in the decreased nopd a schematic diagram was drafted to present the influences of drought stress on yield density relations and nopd dynamics according to the model in drought stressed environment plant individuals were relatively small in body size hence achieving maximum biomass output required more individuals to occupy space and other resources however to some extent this trend generally aggravated the intra specific competition to capture soil water resulting in relatively low harvest index hi in small plant individuals comparing with those individuals of the same size in well watered condition fig 7a in this case the low hi in small individuals under drought stressed condition would be the major factor increasing the scaling exponent fig 7b consequently the population density tended to be lowered and partially sacrifice the resources acquisition ability to achieve maximum grain yield fig 7d some reports have documented that reciprocal equations were more biologically appropriate for simulating the yield density relationship than the symmetric quadratic functions ellis et al 2010 yahuza 2011 from this perspective eq 5 was a reciprocal function to predict the asymmetric yield density relationship that passed through the origin fig 7c 4 4 water productivity in pot culture and field experiments water productivity was another critical agronomic parameter to account for the models in this study it was reported that moderate water stress could improve wuea of dryland wheat under field condition du et al 2010 but in our pot culture experiment water use efficiency for aboveground biomass wuea was the highest in the ss treatments under medium and high plant densities 16 256 plants m 2 followed by the is ones fig b p 0 05 nonetheless the wue for grain yield wueg appeared to be the lowest in the ss treatments across most densities while the is ones were observed to have equal or higher wueg than that in ww ones fig b p 0 05 this phenomenon was in agreement with previous studies du et al 2010 zhang et al 1998 in this study water productivity was more pronounced in the is group the ratio of increased grain weight to increased water use was 1 49 on average of all the densities from is treated plants to ss treated plants while it was 1 24 from ww treated plants to ss treated plants under the field condition the yield improvement effect due to supplemental irrigation was also more pronounced in the dry 2017 growing season it was up to 35 2 on average across different plant densities but only 17 0 in 2018 season this tendency conformed to previous study in northwest china dong et al 2011 thus the irrigation was more helpful to improve yield production of dryland wheat in drier environment under the condition of low water availability the lower densities were beneficial to alleviate water competition among wheat individuals this enabled the small individuals in the majority of the population to elevate the reproductive allocation which turned to improve population yield accordingly 5 conclusion the relationship between population density and reproductive output has been widely observed in higher plant however its ecological mechanism underlying the maximum yield output is not available particularly when water is a sole limiting factor in view of the role of nopd in dryland wheat the observations from pot culture and field experiments achieved basically similar results according to the simulation of quadratic function the nopd of two cultivars in the ss treated condition was decreased by 78 3 and 46 3 respectively compared with those of ww treated condition across wheat genotypes and water treatments the michaelis menten equation presented a high goodness of fit r 2 0 85 p 0 01 in the biomass density relations to explore the mechanism underlying the reduction of nopd under drought stress the mathematical models based on the law of constant final yield and the allometric scaling between grain yield vs body size were performed the model indicated that the nopd was positively associated with the density producing half of maximum biomass but negatively with the scaling exponent of allometric relation in such case the decreased nopd resulted from the significantly increased scaling exponent in both wheat cultivars under drought stress under field condition the nopd was numerically lower in rain fed condition than that of supplemental irrigated condition therefore it can be argued that the scaling exponents of grain yield vs body size allometric relations were increased as a result of drought stress this trend can be responsible for the reduction of nopd in dryland wheat for the first time we verified the hypothesis that drought stress decreased optimum population density for maximum grain yield in dryland wheat using the method of ecological modeling our results suggested that population density of wheat be lower in dry environment rain fed condition than normal irrigated dose for maximizing population yield under the field condition supplementary irrigation in drier seasons could increase the nopd so as to avoid yield loss in semiarid rain fed agricultural region declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

9899,numerous studies have been conducted to understand the mechanism of groundwater recharge for water resources management but the roles of wide spread village ponds on the chinese loess plateau on groundwater recharge remains uncertain here to evaluate the groundwater recharge under village ponds we measured environmental tracers 2h 18o cl in rainwater groundwater and pore waters of the deep unsaturated zone under three land cover types cropland a village pond and two apple orchards with stand ages of 10 and 27 years the results show that shallow groundwater is recharged by both diffusive recharge and focused recharge specifically diffusive recharge occurs beneath farmlands grasslands orchards and similar land cover types but diminishes in old orchards due to deep root water uptake the diffusive recharge beneath crop field had an infiltration velocity of 10 3 12 5 cm yr 1 the resulting recharge rate was 30 33 mm yr 1 accounting for 5 6 of the annual precipitation however focused recharge occurs mainly beneath village ponds with low lying terrain and had an infiltration velocity of 26 cm d 1 during the rainy season the resulting mean recharge rate was 134 mm yr 1 in the catchment of the pond accounting for 23 1 of the annual precipitation given that the water table is generally more than 30 m below the soil surface it takes hundreds of years for rainwater to reach the water table via the diffusive recharge but only days to months via the focused recharge diffusive recharge contributed 55 68 to the total recharge while focused recharge contributed 32 45 however the conversion of croplands to apple orchards and the decrease in the number of village ponds are occurring which diminishes diffusive recharge and reduces focused recharge respectively these findings are critical to understanding hydrological processes and protecting groundwater resources we should preserve reclaim and construct village ponds to ensure groundwater recharge in addition to optimizing areal ratio of large farmland to apple orchards in the region for the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources keywords diffusive recharge focused recharge piston flow environmental tracers peak depth method chloride mass balance loess plateau of china 1 introduction more than 1 5 billion people worldwide rely on groundwater as their primary source of drinking water alley et al 2002 and in area where surface water is insufficient such as in arid and semi arid regions scanlon et al 2006 groundwater is indispensable for food security human health and ecosystem services gleeson et al 2016 groundwater in arid and semi arid regions is primarily recharged slowly through the unsaturated zone by precipitation therefore understanding groundwater recharge mechanisms and determining their rates are prerequisite for sustainable groundwater resource management de vries and simmers 2002 stone and edmunds 2016 generally groundwater recharge through the unsaturated zones has two flow pathways piston flow and preferential flow for piston flow the soil water movement is governed by darcy s law but is conceptualized as moving in a layered form newer water displaces older water so that the older water is pushed down to a deeper layer zimmermann et al 1966 for preferential flow newer water may bypass older water that remains in the soil matrix and moves to a deeper layer or reach the groundwater more rapidly along preferred flow pathways such as vertical cleavages fractures decayed plant roots earthworm burrows and other types of macropores gazis and feng 2004 thus piston flow results in relatively uniform wetting fronts parallel to the soil surface whereas preferential flow leads to finger like wetting fronts bouma 1981 de vries and simmers 2002 groundwater recharge can also be broadly classified according to the relative size of the occurrence area into two categories diffuse recharge and focused recharge diffuse recharge is the recharge derived from precipitation that infiltrates vertically from the surface directly to the aquifer it is widely distributed over the landscape and will only occur if there is sufficient infiltration to overcome the moisture deficit in semiarid to arid environments de vries and simmers 2002 focused recharge however is defined as recharge from ephemeral and seasonal ponds which are formed by surface water runoff that is routed across the landscape to topographically low areas hayashi et al 2003 these ponds may only occupy a small percentage of the area but contribute greatly to the overall groundwater recharge focused recharge is ubiquitous across semiarid and arid regions around the world noorduijn et al 2018 recharge is normally hampered by thick unsaturated zones which allow large water storage during the rainy season vegetation especially those with deep roots then extracts the stored water during the next dry season de vries and simmers 2002 camacho et al 2015 the impediments to recharge in semi arid areas is that the potential evapotranspiration pet is greater than precipitation on average hence groundwater recharge in semi arid regions depends on extreme rainfall events and rainy season when pet is less than precipitation over a brief period typical of such regions is the loess plateau of china lpc hu et al 2019 the lpc is located in the middle of the yellow river basin and encompasses an area of 640 000 km2 fig 1a the plateau is covered by loess deposits with a mean thickness of 106 m zhu et al 2018 the southern part of the lpc is dominated by a high tableland gully region which consists of two geomorphic subunits complete or intact tablelands and gullies the loess tableland region is relatively flat and has historically been the main area of human habitation and livelihood within the lpc groundwater is usually the primary water resource in the area and is only recharged by rainwater the loess tableland is characterized by a very thick unsaturated zone usually more than 30 100 m that possesses large potential soil water storage huang et al 2019a 2019b lu et al 2020 xiang et al 2019 unfortunately the water table has experienced rapid declines since the 1990s huang and pang 2011 cheng et al 2016 therefore understanding groundwater recharge mechanisms and rates has been a widely investigated topic wang 1982 xue 1995 yan 1986 yan and wang 1983 zhang et al 1990 especially during the last decade with the assistance of environmental tracers cheng et al 2014b gates et al 2011 huang et al 2019a li et al 2018 lin and wei 2006 tan et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 however the recharge mechanisms remain controversial on the loess plateau some studies have suggested that groundwater is recharged only by piston flow huang et al 2019a huang and pang 2011 tao et al 2021 li et al 2018 others suggested that preferential flow is also at play cheng et al 2014b huang et al 2019b li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 however there has been little direct observations of preferential pathways zheng et al 2017 through a modeling study shao et al 2019 concluded that extreme wet years could generate rapid piston flow which could explain sooner than expected appearance no3 in groundwater but is not rapid enough to explain the much shorter than expected response time of groundwater to precipitation therefore there may be other recharge mechanisms that have not been accounted in the region interestingly villagers have historically dug ponds in the low lying areas within the village to collect surface runoff from roads and courtyards during the rainy season on the lpc due in part to the lack of water resources as well as the lack of sophisticated technology to install wells the construction of such ponds dates back thousands of years the pond water was historically important for washing irrigating vegetable plots and keeping domestic animals more importantly the ponds provide important ecological services such as forming wetlands and preventing soil erosion huang et al 2004 however the use and function of ponds has been disappearing with the construction of various water supply projects by the government since the 1980s cheng et al 2016 and ponds have been destroyed due to village road and house construction as a result the number of ponds has decreased rapidly yang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 found that there were two ponds per km2 in the changwu tableland during the 1960s but in 2014 the number decreased to 0 5 ponds per km2 this decline will likely affect the sustainable recharge of groundwater in the future therefore there is an urgent need to study groundwater recharge mechanisms and rates beneath village ponds ponds form an important land use type in villages on the loess plateau being a shallow topographic depression a pond receives stormwater from one or more nearby impervious surfaces such as roofs or parking lots dussaillant et al 2004 aravena and dussaillant 2009 however there is little research on these village level ponds regarding groundwater recharge we hypothesize that the above mentioned controversies may be because those studies primarily focusing on diffusive recharge beneath farmlands orchards grasslands and other similar types of land cover have neglected the focused recharge beneath rain gardens ponds these ponds may increase groundwater recharge by means of focused recharge the primary objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the recharge mechanism s beneath the village ponds with environmental tracers cl 2h 18o and 2 quantify recharge rates beneath different land cover types particularly under village ponds on the chinese loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in changwu county 35 28 n 107 88 e shaanxi province china fig 1a the region is characterized by a warm continental monsoonal climate the long term 1959 2018 average annual precipitation and air temperature are 582 mm and 9 1 c respectively the long term average annual pet is 980 mm han et al 2015 the average precipitation during the rainy season from july to september is 316 mm which accounts for 54 of the annual precipitation fig 2 the changwu tableland is relatively flat with an average elevation of 1200 m above sea level however it is dissected by deep gullies with depths of more than 300 m that slope gradually to bedrock the bedrock is covered by three loess layers the wucheng loess lishi loess and malan loess fig 1b xiang et al 2019 there is a series of paleosols in the loess profile and these paleosols have a finer soil texture than the loess the measured soil dry bulk density is 1 31 0 03 g cm 3 for loess and 1 50 0 04 g cm 3 for paleosol and the field capacity is 21 21 0 46 g g 1 for loess and 24 68 1 63 g g 1 for paleosol in the study area the groundwater level in the tableland is higher than the stream or river levels in the gullies which suggests that rainwater is the only water source for groundwater recharge in the tableland the depth of the water table ranges from 30 to 90 m and increases in depth from the center of the tableland to its margins ultimately the groundwater is discharged to streams or rivers in the form of gravity fed springs in the gullies the tableland is historically the main grain producing area in the lpc however farmers are currently incentivized to convert large areas of agricultural land to apple orchards the latter of which yield a higher income as a result apple orchards have rapidly expanded since the 1990 s cheng et al 2016 2 2 sampling and laboratory analyses four soil sediment cores were collected from the changwu tableland near the changwu agro ecological experimental station fig 1c the collected cores table 1 included one along the bank of a pond l1 which is located in a low lying area about 3 m below the altitude of cropland and apple orchard of the village one from cropland l2 and two from apple orchards with stand ages of 10 years l3 and 27 years l4 the soil cores were collected using a hydraulic percussive soil drill tgq 30 c beijing cesm ltd chn and sampled at an interval of 0 2 m each soil sample was divided into two subsamples the first subsample 60 g was sealed in an aluminum box and used to determine the gravimetric water content θ g θ g was determined by measuring the loss in the soil mass after drying the soil at 105 c for 24 h the volumetric water content θ v was subsequently calculated by multiplying θ g by the soil bulk density and then dividing that quantity by water density 1 g cm 3 the dried soil sample was then used to determine the cl concentration in soil water to determine the cl concentration a 3 6 mmol l 1 na2co3 and 4 5 mmol l 1 nahco3 solution 30 ml was added to an oven dried soil sample 3 g samples were first agitated on a reciprocal shaker table for 2 h on a supersonic oscillator for 1 h allowed to stand still for 15 min and then separated with centrifugal treatment at 12 000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant solution was then filtered through 0 45 µm filters and the cl concentration of the solution was analyzed using ion chromatography mic 2 metrohm che the cl concentration of soil pore water c s mg l 1 was then calculated as 1 c s c v o θ g m ρ where c is the cl concentration of the solute mg l 1 v o is the volume of solution 30 ml θ g is the gravimetric water content g g 1 m is the mass of the oven dried soil sample 3 g and ρ is the water density 1 g cm 3 the second subsample 200 g was sealed in polyethylene bottles and used to extract soil water for determination of its stable isotopic composition and for the measurement of soil particle composition soil particle size distribution was measured by a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd gbr and characterized according to the international soil science society classification scheme soil water was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation instrument li 2000 beijing lica ltd chn a total of 24 daily rainwater samples were collected from a rain gauge between april 1 and august 17 2018 at the changwu agro ecological experiment station all water samples were sealed in glass vials and refrigerated at 4 c for further stable isotope analysis stable isotopic compositions of the rainwater and soil water samples were analyzed using an isotopic liquid water analyzer liwa 912 0050 lgr inc usa each sample was injected six times but the first two injections were discarded to eliminate memory effects the average for injections 3 6 was used for the isotope ratio calculation results are expressed as δ values relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in per mil the precision of the instrument is 0 4 for δd and 0 1 for δ 18o 2 3 estimating recharge the chloride mass balance cmb allison and hughes 1978 edmunds et al 1988 method has been used successfully to estimate the recharge rate of groundwater in rain fed areas scanlon et al 2006 stone and edmunds 2016 especially in the lpc gates et al 2011 huang et al 2013 2017 li et al 2017 lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the potential recharge rate r mm yr 1 beneath farmland can be calculated as 2 r p c p c s where p is mean annual precipitation mm c p and c s are the mean cl concentrations in precipitation and soil water below the root zone mg l 1 respectively long term records of wet and dry deposition of cl are essential to estimate recharge using the cmb method the volume weighted average cl concentration in rainfall was 1 0 mg l 1 which was obtained from a rural eanet monitoring station jiwozi xi an eanet 2020 located approximately 100 km east of the study area between 2000 and 2018 dry deposition may contribute as much as 10 33 of the total cl input huang et al 2017 here we assumed that dry deposition was equal to 20 of the wet deposition thus the total c p was 1 2 mg l 1 using these values of wet and dry deposition the annual cl input from the atmosphere was estimated to be 698 mg m 2 yr 1 582 mm yr 1 1 2 mg l 1 the infiltration velocity i mm yr 1 can be calculated as 3 i r θ v where r is the recharge rate and θ v is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 the cmb method assumes that the only source of cl is atmospheric contributions of cl from weathering and surface runoff are negligible and the one dimensional 1 d vertical steady state cl flux is tenable huang et al 2020 this is particularly suited to the farmland where the rooting depth is generally less than 3 m li et al 2018 however the cmb cannot be used to estimate the potential recharge rate under the ponds because surface runoff from the villages from different times are mixed in the ponds making the flow below the pond transient however the peak depth method can be used to estimate the potential recharge rate under the ponds in this case the potential recharge rate r mm yr 1 beneath a pond is calculated as 4 r 0 l θ v d z δ t and the infiltration velocity is calculated as 5 i l δ t where l is the distance mm moved by the peak in the trace concentration over a period of time δt yr θ v is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 at depth z the cmb method is unsuitable for deep rooted vegetation such as apple trees because a new steady state is not established in the unsaturated zone huang and pang 2011 in order to estimate the potential recharge rate under apple orchards zhang et al 2018 developed a method based on eq 1 6 r d r s δ s δ t where r d is the recharge rate under deep rooted vegetation e g apple trees r s is the recharge rate under shallow rooted vegetation crops obtained by eq 1 δs is the deficit of soil water storage under the apple orchard relative to the cropland and δt is the age of the apple trees the soil water storage can be calculated as 7 s 0 h θ v d z where s is the soil water storage in the soil to a certain depth h θ v is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 at depth z 2 4 contributions from two forms of recharge if focused recharge and diffusive recharge are considered as possible recharge forms then the contributions of focused and diffusive recharge to groundwater recharge can be estimated as 8 c f c d r f r d a f a d r f a f r d a d where c f and c d are the contributions of focused recharge and diffusive recharge to groundwater recharge respectively r f is the average recharge rate beneath the catchment of the pond in the village r d is the recharge rate of diffusive recharge a f is the catchment area of the pond and a d is the area of diffusive recharge 3 results 3 1 soil characteristics and soil water contents below village ponds farmlands and orchards the average clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 02 mm and sand 0 02 2 mm contents in the l2 loess profile were 30 6 2 9 34 5 2 4 and 34 9 4 6 respectively fig 3a according to the international union of soil science iuss classification scheme loess can be classified as silt loam because loess profile has little horizontal variability in soil texture across the changwu tableland lu et al 2020 we can assume that soil texture profile at l2 represents that of l1 l3 and l4 soil water contents swc fluctuated with depth through the loess profile fig 3b the fluctuations were generally consistent with the clay content variations however beneath l4 the fluctuations were attenuated and swcs decreased in deeper layers of the apple trees fig 3b the average values of θ v were 0 358 0 288 0 281 and 0 203 cm3 cm 3 for the four sites l1 l2 l3 and l4 respectively the swcs in the root zone or zone of water recycling stone and edmunds 2016 was highly variable because of differing water input precipitation runoff soil evaporation and water uptake by plants long term monitoring experiments in the changwu loess tableland cheng and liu 2014 cheng et al 2014 show that the depth of the water recycling zone commonly extends 4 m below the ground surface swcs below the recycling zone mainly affected by land cover were relatively stable over time for farmland cheng et al 2014a cheng and liu 2014 but decreased with increasing age of the apple tree stands for apple orchards li et al 2019 thus the swcs below 4 m within l2 were similar to that of l3 but were greater than that of l4 in addition l1 had the highest swc among the four sites and its swc was always greater than the field capacity this provided a necessary condition for the rapid downward movement of soil water under the influence of gravity 3 2 chloride concentrations in pore water below the village pond farmland and orchard there was a peak cl concentration at depths of 1 2 2 4 m beneath l2 and l3 but three zones of high cl concentrations were present beneath l4 at depths of 0 4 0 6 m 2 4 2 6 m and 4 5 m fig 4a the high cl concentrations near the ground surface were a result of intensive use of cl containing fertilizers in apple orchards in the region since the 1980 s huang et al 2019b lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 therefore the cl concentrations of pore water were high and varied greatly with depth in the upper part of the loess profile 0 6 m however they were low and varied little within the deeper profile fig 4a table 1 beneath l2 l3 and l4 both the cl profiles and the 1963 tritium peak fig 4b in the homogeneous loess profile reflected the piston flow dominated vertical downward movement of soil water beneath croplands and orchards huang et al 2019a li et al 2018 lin and wei 2006 lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 however l1 did not have any cl peak within the loess profile and had the lowest cl concentration among the four sites the low cl concentration beneath l1 typically suggests that there has been a rapid movement of soil water as well as large water fluxes which led to a reduced effect of evaporation and enhanced leaching on soil water 3 3 stable isotope profiles in pore water below the village pond farmland and orchard l2 l3 and l4 had similar vertical distributions of the stable isotopes in the profile the δ 18o values ranged from 10 6 to 5 9 and the δ 2h values ranged from 81 8 to 46 9 within the recycling zone within the deeper zone isotopic values were less variable between 10 5 and 7 8 for δ 18o between 75 9 and 61 5 for δ 2h beneath l2 as well as l3 and l4 fig 5a b this is consistent with the understanding that the isotopic contents of soil water varied greatly in the recycling zone due to the effects of rainfall infiltration and soil evaporation but became relatively constant with time in the deeper layers of the profile cheng et al 2014 sprenger et al 2016 xiang et al 2021 the reason for this is that under relatively slow vertical soil water movement diffusion and dispersion processes attenuate seasonal or annual variations in isotopic values within the deep unsaturated zone allison 1988 clark and fritz 1997 however the isotopic values beneath l1 differed from the other sites the stable isotopes varied significantly with depth under l1 the δ 18o values ranged from 16 6 to 7 7 whereas the δ 2h values ranged from 117 8 to 56 7 fig 5a b the comparison of the variations in stable isotopes within the profile beneath l1 and the temporal variations in stable isotopes in rainwater from july to august show that the data correlate fig 5 further the isotopic signals of precipitation were preserved in the loess profile beneath l1 these trends imply that soil water moves downward by piston flow and at a faster velocity than would be expected from diffusion and dispersion of isotopic signals 3 4 comparison of stable isotopes in precipitation soil water and groundwater the soil water δ 18o and δ 2h values for l1 plot on the local meteoric water line lmwl and retained the isotopic characteristics of precipitation measured in july and august 2018 fig 6 thus deep soil water beneath l1 consisted of recharged water with little evaporation because of rapid infiltration with a few exceptions soil water isotopic data collected beneath l2 l3 and l4 plot below the lmwl suggesting that the stable isotopes in soil water were enriched by evaporation the variation in groundwater isotopic compositions was smaller than that of soil water in general the isotopic values of groundwater were located at the lower left of that of soil water beneath the cropland and apple orchards but were located on the upper right of that of soil water beneath the pond fig 6 this suggests that groundwater may be recharged by a mixture of the two kinds of soil water water from beneath the pond and water from beneath the cropland and apple orchards although soil water at all sites moved downward by piston flow the water below the pond moved downward much faster than the soil water below cropland and apple orchards due in part to the large differences in water input the groundwater stable isotopic compositions are similar to that of precipitation during the rainy season july september fig 6 indicating that groundwater was recharged by intense rainfall from july to september this is also supported by previous studies cheng et al 2014 huang et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 3 5 estimated recharge from the village pond cropland and orchards 3 5 1 village pond the isotopic signal of precipitation on july 11 was detected at the depth of 11 5 m in the loess profile fig 5 because the depth of the pond was 2 m the depth of 11 5 m was corrected to 9 5 m the average infiltration velocity between july 11 and august 17 was 26 cm d 1 as estimated by eq 5 suggesting that it would take 115 346 days for a rainfall event to reach the water table at a depth of 30 90 m the soil water storage between the depths of 2 0 11 5 m was 3389 mm and the average recharge rate from july 11 to august 17 as calculated by eq 4 was 92 mm d 1 the area of the pond was about 750 m2 whereas the catchment area of the pond was about 36 400 m2 therefore the average groundwater recharge rate beneath the catchment of the pond in the village was 70 mm 3389 750 36 400 from july 11 to august 17 this accounted for 42 4 of the precipitation 165 mm between july 11 and august 17 if this ratio represents the average ratio during the entire wet season july to september and the average annual precipitation during the rainy season was 316 mm 1959 2018 the average groundwater recharge rate was 134 mm yr 1 316 43 1 beneath the catchment of the pond in the village this accounted for 23 1 of the annual precipitation it is important to note however that because the sampling site was at the edge of the pond i e not in the pond the actual recharge rate and infiltration velocity beneath the pond is likely to be greater than the calculated values 3 5 2 cropland the long term average groundwater recharge under l2 was quantified based on the cmb method to further exclude the potential impacts of fertilizer application the cl concentrations below the depth of 8 m were adopted as has been done in previous studies in the same area li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the weighted average pore water cl concentration in the profile below 8 m was 23 4 mg l 1 beneath l2 from 8 to 29 m the groundwater recharge rate as calculated by eq 2 was 30 mm yr 1 and accounted for 5 2 of the annual precipitation the average volumetric water content below 8 m was 0 291 cm3 cm 3 and the infiltration velocity as calculated by eq 3 was 10 3 cm yr 1 the tritium peak corresponds to the tritium in precipitation in 1963 which still remains in the loess profiles fig 4b huang et al 2019a li et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 tao et al 2021 in 2015 52 years since 1963 tritium peaks at 6 1 6 5 m were clearly detectable beneath the farmland in the changwu tableland li et al 2018 lu et al 2020 therefore the infiltration velocity as calculated by eq 5 was 11 7 12 5 cm yr 1 the average volumetric water content above 6 5 m was 0 264 cm3 cm 3 whereas the recharge rate was 31 33 mm yr 1 as calculated by eq 4 thus recharge accounted for 5 3 5 7 of the mean annual precipitation a recharge rate of 30 33 mm yr 1 was calculated for cropland accounting for 5 2 5 7 of annual precipitation with an infiltration velocity of 10 3 12 5 cm yr 1 on the basis of the cmb and tritium peak methods it would take 240 874 years for a rainfall event to reach the water table at 30 90 m depth below cropland 3 5 3 apple orchards the conversion from farmland to apple orchards has led to soil water depletion and cl accumulation in the soil profiles huang and pang 2011 zhang et al 2018 for example between a depth of 6 and 11 m the depletion of water storage beneath l4 was 667 mm as compared to the l2 the weighted averaged cl concentration was 21 7 mg l 1 beneath l2 and 55 2 mg l 1 beneath l4 however a new steady state condition beneath the apple orchard may not have been reached because the rooting depth beneath a mature apple orchard was 23 m li et al 2019 resulting in cl accumulation to greater depths in the profile soil water storage values beneath l2 l3 and l4 were 4905 4802 and 3226 mm for the profile between 4 and 21 m beneath the water recycling zone respectively compared to l2 the water storage deficit of l3 and l4 were 103 mm and 1679 mm respectively consequently a reduction in soil water storage beneath l3 and l4 were 11 mm yr 1 and 62 mm yr 1 respectively the potential groundwater recharge rate under the apple orchards using eq 6 was zero for the mature apple orchard but was 19 22 mm yr 1 for the young apple orchard the reason for the difference may be that the young apple trees consume less water and thus may be comparable to cropland during the first few years li et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 recharge mechanisms as also suggested by previous studies rainwater is the only recharge source for shallow groundwater in the loess tableland cheng et al 2014 huang et al 2019a huang et al 2019b tan et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 however the mechanism of water flow piston or preferential flow remains controversial for example the 1963 tritium peak in the loess profile confirms the existence of piston flow huang et al 2019a 2019b li et al 2018 lin and wei 2006 lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 and the undetectable 3h in the groundwater samples indicates that piston flow was the sole recharge mechanism in some studies huang et al 2019a 2017 if this is representative of the region the time required for precipitation to reach the water table will range from decades to hundreds of years therefore groundwater will be pre modern or paleo water within an integrated tableland huang et al 2019a 2017 however other studies reported different phenomena an obvious increase in water table elevation due to precipitation was observed during the rainy season yan 1986 yan and wang 1983 and dynamic changes in groundwater isotopic values although smaller than in precipitation were consistent with that of precipitation huang et al 2019b these changes confirm that groundwater is also recharged by rapid flow from precipitation and that groundwater may include both modern and paleo waters huang et al 2019b xiang et al 2019 the occurrence of such rapid flow was also supported by the detection of 3h in groundwater samples in a few previous studies huang et al 2019b li et al 2017 lin and wei 2006 song et al 2017 tan et al 2017 the dual flow mechanism of water flow resulted in differing stable o and h isotopic compositions between deep soil water and groundwater cheng et al 2014 li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 the above mentioned studies all employed environmental tracers e g 2h 18o 3h cl no3 and 13c yet inconsistent conclusions were obtained regarding the mechanisms of soil water flow in the loess tableland this may be because all previous studies only focused on groundwater recharge beneath cropland orchards and grassland and did not consider recharge beneath village ponds the cropland orchards and grasslands are flat due to long term tillage possessing negligible surface runoff and no visible depressions liu et al 2010 thus diffusive recharge through the unsaturated zone in the loess tableland is the only recharge mechanism under farmland orchards and grasslands fig 7 the diffusive recharge featuring a stable annual recharge rate 30 33 mm yr 1 and a slow infiltration velocity 10 3 12 5 mm yr 1 is supported by previous studies huang et al 2019a 2017 2019b lu et al 2020 however there are many low lying areas and water channels in villages including ponds surface runoff from roads and courtyards generated from intense monsoonal rainfalls collects in those ponds in the villages these village ponds create favorable conditions for focused recharge fig 7 our study first measured the stable 18o and 2h isotopic compositions and cl concentrations of the loess profile along the bank of a village pond the isotopic data demonstrate that focused recharge also occurs by infiltration in the form of piston like flow fig 5 unlike piston flow associated with diffusive recharge the piston flow in the form of focused recharge has a greater infiltration velocity 26 cm d 1 this rapid piston flow is very likely the preferential flow that was inferred by previous studies huang et al 2019b xiang et al 2019 the current study showed that the time needed for precipitation to reach the water table by the focused recharge ranged from several days to months which explains why 1 the water table responded to intense rainfall much earlier than expected yan 1986 yan and wang 1983 2 the dynamic changes of isotopic compositions of groundwater were consistent with that of precipitation huang et al 2019b and 3 the stable isotopic compositions differed between groundwater and deep soil water beneath farmland and orchards cheng et al 2014 li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 4 2 accuracy of estimated recharge 4 2 1 focused recharge the focused recharge rate under villages has not been documented in previous studies in the lpc thus the data presented here are novel and of benefit to our understanding of groundwater recharge the swcs within the loess profile under the pond was always greater than the field capacity indicating that soil water moves downward in gravity driven near saturated flow our results show that the calculated infiltration velocity was 26 cm d 1 the simulated saturated hydraulic conductivity within 0 25 2 m of the loess profile as determined by a hydrus 1d model was 6 4 37 3 cm d 1 in the study area li 2019 given the average volumetric water content is 0 358 cm3 cm 3 the most resistant layer will have a saturated flow velocity under unit gradient to be 22 9 cm d 1 thus our measured infiltration velocity 26 cm d 1 was similar to the infiltration velocity estimated from the simulated saturated hydraulic conductivity of the loess sediments under unit hydraulic gradient this further supports the estimated infiltration rate and thus the focused recharge rate under the pond in this study 4 2 2 diffusive recharge because the cmb method is highly sensitive to cl inputs p c p and the cl concentration in soil water c s eq 1 the accuracy of the estimated long term recharge rate was limited by uncertainties in cl input and cl concentrations in soil water fouty 1989 assuming a 10 20 error in the cl input and cl concentrations in soil water the total error for the groundwater recharge derived from eq 1 is 23 huang and pang 2011 due to the lack of long term monitoring data of cl concentration in precipitation c p in most areas of the loess plateau the volume weighted average c p from a rural monitoring station jiwozi near xi an eanet in the southern part of the loess plateau has been used in previous studies however the values of c p differ between studies because of the specific years selected they range from 1 0 to 1 7 mg l 1 table 2 the values of c s also differ between studies the differences in c s table 2 reflect spatial variations in the properties of the loess deposits in different districts and the method of extracting cl from soil which is key to measurement of cl in the solute as analyzed by ion chromatography in this study cl was extracted from soil using a 3 6 mmol l 1 na2co3 4 5 mmol l 1 nahco3 solution which is more effective wang et al 2010 due to the complementary ion effect of the exchangeable ions due to the uncertainties of c p and c s the estimated recharge rate in the literature for the lpc ranges from 2 to 22 of the average annual precipitation table2 the estimated recharge rate in this study was 30 33 mm yr 1 for cropland accounting for 5 2 5 7 of annual precipitation this estimate falls within the range reported in the literature 4 3 contributions of focused and diffusive recharge the loess tableland region is a traditional farming area where the main land use types are agricultural and residential although historically there have been a few other land use types the conversion of large areas of farmlands to apple orchards in the region began in the 1990 s because of their ability to yield a higher economic income cheng et al 2016 therefore at present there are three dominant land use types residential land farmland and apple orchards which account for 24 44 and 32 of the area of the changwu tableland respectively apple trees tend to consume more water and the soil water deficit significantly increases with tree age suggesting that the conversion of farmlands to apple orchards limits the diffusive recharge to groundwater this is supported by the work of huang et al 2019b zhang et al 2018 and the similar phenomena were also recorded in the argentine pampas the eucalyptus camaldulensis plantation which reduced groundwater recharge and depressed the water table 38 cm on average compared to the adjacent grassland in two years jobbágy and jackson 2004 due to very low infiltration velocities 10 3 12 5 cm yr 1 below these deep rooted orchards the apparent impacts on actual groundwater recharge will be shown in the future li et al 2018 huang et al 2019b the area of the ponds was 503 m2 per km2 during the 1960s but decreased to 171 m2 per km2 in 2014 in the changwu loess tableland region yang et al 2014 this is equivalent to a reduction of 34 this means that the catchment area of the ponds along with surface runoff must have declined causing the focused recharge rate to decrease assuming that the decrease in the percentage of catchment area was same as the ponds area the contributions of focused recharge and diffusive recharge to groundwater recharge estimated by eq 8 are 32 45 and 55 68 respectively table 3 thus diffusive recharge is the main form of groundwater recharge which is consistent with previous isotope studies by huang et al 2019b xiang et al 2019 huang et al 2019b found that diffusive recharge accounted for 53 69 of the total recharge whereas xiang et al 2019 showed that diffusive recharge contributed 62 8 to the total recharge in the loess tableland region 4 4 implications to groundwater resource sustainability focused recharge and diffusive recharge coexist in the loess tableland region however diffusive recharge diminishes by the conversion of croplands to apple orchards whereas focused recharge reduces with the number of ponds destroyed by new rural construction new rural construction along with improved pumping capacity also led to the increased pumping of shallow groundwater the combination of diminished recharge and increased pumping lead to groundwater depletion thereby potentially threatening the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources in the loess tableland region therefore to ensure a sustainable groundwater supply it is important to enhance focused recharge beneath the village ponds and to implement rotation between croplands and apple in order to keep a reasonable areal ratio of orchards to cropland we suggest land use planners 1 to increase village pond protection by avoiding the removal of ponds in the process of road and housing construction and 2 to build new ponds to receive runoff during new rural construction to avoid runoff being discharged directly into the valleys 5 conclusions it is important to understand and quantify recharge mechanisms for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in this study stable isotopes 2h and 18o and cl were used to determine the groundwater recharge mechanisms and evaluated the recharge rate and infiltration velocity at different sites in the changwu loess tableland we developed a conceptual model for recharge processes in the loess tableland although piston flow dominates groundwater recharge in the loess tableland the tableland region can be divided into two hydrological units the first unit includes farmlands orchards grasslands and similar land cover types and the second unit includes ponds and other low lying areas in villages in the first unit groundwater recharge is characterized by diffusive recharge and the infiltration velocity was 10 3 12 5 cm yr 1 in the second unit groundwater recharge is mainly characterized by focused recharge beneath village ponds and the mean infiltration velocity was 26 cm d 1 during the rainy season diffusive recharge contributed 55 68 to the total recharge while focused recharge contributed 32 45 however the conversion of croplands to apple orchards limits diffusive recharge whereas decreasing the number of village ponds limits focused recharge both lead to groundwater depletion these findings suggest that we should protect recover and reconstruct village ponds to ensure groundwater recharge as well as to limit the conversion of large areas of farmland to apple orchards in the region to ensure the sustainable utilization of

9899,numerous studies have been conducted to understand the mechanism of groundwater recharge for water resources management but the roles of wide spread village ponds on the chinese loess plateau on groundwater recharge remains uncertain here to evaluate the groundwater recharge under village ponds we measured environmental tracers 2h 18o cl in rainwater groundwater and pore waters of the deep unsaturated zone under three land cover types cropland a village pond and two apple orchards with stand ages of 10 and 27 years the results show that shallow groundwater is recharged by both diffusive recharge and focused recharge specifically diffusive recharge occurs beneath farmlands grasslands orchards and similar land cover types but diminishes in old orchards due to deep root water uptake the diffusive recharge beneath crop field had an infiltration velocity of 10 3 12 5 cm yr 1 the resulting recharge rate was 30 33 mm yr 1 accounting for 5 6 of the annual precipitation however focused recharge occurs mainly beneath village ponds with low lying terrain and had an infiltration velocity of 26 cm d 1 during the rainy season the resulting mean recharge rate was 134 mm yr 1 in the catchment of the pond accounting for 23 1 of the annual precipitation given that the water table is generally more than 30 m below the soil surface it takes hundreds of years for rainwater to reach the water table via the diffusive recharge but only days to months via the focused recharge diffusive recharge contributed 55 68 to the total recharge while focused recharge contributed 32 45 however the conversion of croplands to apple orchards and the decrease in the number of village ponds are occurring which diminishes diffusive recharge and reduces focused recharge respectively these findings are critical to understanding hydrological processes and protecting groundwater resources we should preserve reclaim and construct village ponds to ensure groundwater recharge in addition to optimizing areal ratio of large farmland to apple orchards in the region for the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources keywords diffusive recharge focused recharge piston flow environmental tracers peak depth method chloride mass balance loess plateau of china 1 introduction more than 1 5 billion people worldwide rely on groundwater as their primary source of drinking water alley et al 2002 and in area where surface water is insufficient such as in arid and semi arid regions scanlon et al 2006 groundwater is indispensable for food security human health and ecosystem services gleeson et al 2016 groundwater in arid and semi arid regions is primarily recharged slowly through the unsaturated zone by precipitation therefore understanding groundwater recharge mechanisms and determining their rates are prerequisite for sustainable groundwater resource management de vries and simmers 2002 stone and edmunds 2016 generally groundwater recharge through the unsaturated zones has two flow pathways piston flow and preferential flow for piston flow the soil water movement is governed by darcy s law but is conceptualized as moving in a layered form newer water displaces older water so that the older water is pushed down to a deeper layer zimmermann et al 1966 for preferential flow newer water may bypass older water that remains in the soil matrix and moves to a deeper layer or reach the groundwater more rapidly along preferred flow pathways such as vertical cleavages fractures decayed plant roots earthworm burrows and other types of macropores gazis and feng 2004 thus piston flow results in relatively uniform wetting fronts parallel to the soil surface whereas preferential flow leads to finger like wetting fronts bouma 1981 de vries and simmers 2002 groundwater recharge can also be broadly classified according to the relative size of the occurrence area into two categories diffuse recharge and focused recharge diffuse recharge is the recharge derived from precipitation that infiltrates vertically from the surface directly to the aquifer it is widely distributed over the landscape and will only occur if there is sufficient infiltration to overcome the moisture deficit in semiarid to arid environments de vries and simmers 2002 focused recharge however is defined as recharge from ephemeral and seasonal ponds which are formed by surface water runoff that is routed across the landscape to topographically low areas hayashi et al 2003 these ponds may only occupy a small percentage of the area but contribute greatly to the overall groundwater recharge focused recharge is ubiquitous across semiarid and arid regions around the world noorduijn et al 2018 recharge is normally hampered by thick unsaturated zones which allow large water storage during the rainy season vegetation especially those with deep roots then extracts the stored water during the next dry season de vries and simmers 2002 camacho et al 2015 the impediments to recharge in semi arid areas is that the potential evapotranspiration pet is greater than precipitation on average hence groundwater recharge in semi arid regions depends on extreme rainfall events and rainy season when pet is less than precipitation over a brief period typical of such regions is the loess plateau of china lpc hu et al 2019 the lpc is located in the middle of the yellow river basin and encompasses an area of 640 000 km2 fig 1a the plateau is covered by loess deposits with a mean thickness of 106 m zhu et al 2018 the southern part of the lpc is dominated by a high tableland gully region which consists of two geomorphic subunits complete or intact tablelands and gullies the loess tableland region is relatively flat and has historically been the main area of human habitation and livelihood within the lpc groundwater is usually the primary water resource in the area and is only recharged by rainwater the loess tableland is characterized by a very thick unsaturated zone usually more than 30 100 m that possesses large potential soil water storage huang et al 2019a 2019b lu et al 2020 xiang et al 2019 unfortunately the water table has experienced rapid declines since the 1990s huang and pang 2011 cheng et al 2016 therefore understanding groundwater recharge mechanisms and rates has been a widely investigated topic wang 1982 xue 1995 yan 1986 yan and wang 1983 zhang et al 1990 especially during the last decade with the assistance of environmental tracers cheng et al 2014b gates et al 2011 huang et al 2019a li et al 2018 lin and wei 2006 tan et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 however the recharge mechanisms remain controversial on the loess plateau some studies have suggested that groundwater is recharged only by piston flow huang et al 2019a huang and pang 2011 tao et al 2021 li et al 2018 others suggested that preferential flow is also at play cheng et al 2014b huang et al 2019b li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 however there has been little direct observations of preferential pathways zheng et al 2017 through a modeling study shao et al 2019 concluded that extreme wet years could generate rapid piston flow which could explain sooner than expected appearance no3 in groundwater but is not rapid enough to explain the much shorter than expected response time of groundwater to precipitation therefore there may be other recharge mechanisms that have not been accounted in the region interestingly villagers have historically dug ponds in the low lying areas within the village to collect surface runoff from roads and courtyards during the rainy season on the lpc due in part to the lack of water resources as well as the lack of sophisticated technology to install wells the construction of such ponds dates back thousands of years the pond water was historically important for washing irrigating vegetable plots and keeping domestic animals more importantly the ponds provide important ecological services such as forming wetlands and preventing soil erosion huang et al 2004 however the use and function of ponds has been disappearing with the construction of various water supply projects by the government since the 1980s cheng et al 2016 and ponds have been destroyed due to village road and house construction as a result the number of ponds has decreased rapidly yang et al 2015 yang et al 2015 found that there were two ponds per km2 in the changwu tableland during the 1960s but in 2014 the number decreased to 0 5 ponds per km2 this decline will likely affect the sustainable recharge of groundwater in the future therefore there is an urgent need to study groundwater recharge mechanisms and rates beneath village ponds ponds form an important land use type in villages on the loess plateau being a shallow topographic depression a pond receives stormwater from one or more nearby impervious surfaces such as roofs or parking lots dussaillant et al 2004 aravena and dussaillant 2009 however there is little research on these village level ponds regarding groundwater recharge we hypothesize that the above mentioned controversies may be because those studies primarily focusing on diffusive recharge beneath farmlands orchards grasslands and other similar types of land cover have neglected the focused recharge beneath rain gardens ponds these ponds may increase groundwater recharge by means of focused recharge the primary objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the recharge mechanism s beneath the village ponds with environmental tracers cl 2h 18o and 2 quantify recharge rates beneath different land cover types particularly under village ponds on the chinese loess plateau 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in changwu county 35 28 n 107 88 e shaanxi province china fig 1a the region is characterized by a warm continental monsoonal climate the long term 1959 2018 average annual precipitation and air temperature are 582 mm and 9 1 c respectively the long term average annual pet is 980 mm han et al 2015 the average precipitation during the rainy season from july to september is 316 mm which accounts for 54 of the annual precipitation fig 2 the changwu tableland is relatively flat with an average elevation of 1200 m above sea level however it is dissected by deep gullies with depths of more than 300 m that slope gradually to bedrock the bedrock is covered by three loess layers the wucheng loess lishi loess and malan loess fig 1b xiang et al 2019 there is a series of paleosols in the loess profile and these paleosols have a finer soil texture than the loess the measured soil dry bulk density is 1 31 0 03 g cm 3 for loess and 1 50 0 04 g cm 3 for paleosol and the field capacity is 21 21 0 46 g g 1 for loess and 24 68 1 63 g g 1 for paleosol in the study area the groundwater level in the tableland is higher than the stream or river levels in the gullies which suggests that rainwater is the only water source for groundwater recharge in the tableland the depth of the water table ranges from 30 to 90 m and increases in depth from the center of the tableland to its margins ultimately the groundwater is discharged to streams or rivers in the form of gravity fed springs in the gullies the tableland is historically the main grain producing area in the lpc however farmers are currently incentivized to convert large areas of agricultural land to apple orchards the latter of which yield a higher income as a result apple orchards have rapidly expanded since the 1990 s cheng et al 2016 2 2 sampling and laboratory analyses four soil sediment cores were collected from the changwu tableland near the changwu agro ecological experimental station fig 1c the collected cores table 1 included one along the bank of a pond l1 which is located in a low lying area about 3 m below the altitude of cropland and apple orchard of the village one from cropland l2 and two from apple orchards with stand ages of 10 years l3 and 27 years l4 the soil cores were collected using a hydraulic percussive soil drill tgq 30 c beijing cesm ltd chn and sampled at an interval of 0 2 m each soil sample was divided into two subsamples the first subsample 60 g was sealed in an aluminum box and used to determine the gravimetric water content θ g θ g was determined by measuring the loss in the soil mass after drying the soil at 105 c for 24 h the volumetric water content θ v was subsequently calculated by multiplying θ g by the soil bulk density and then dividing that quantity by water density 1 g cm 3 the dried soil sample was then used to determine the cl concentration in soil water to determine the cl concentration a 3 6 mmol l 1 na2co3 and 4 5 mmol l 1 nahco3 solution 30 ml was added to an oven dried soil sample 3 g samples were first agitated on a reciprocal shaker table for 2 h on a supersonic oscillator for 1 h allowed to stand still for 15 min and then separated with centrifugal treatment at 12 000 rpm for 15 min the supernatant solution was then filtered through 0 45 µm filters and the cl concentration of the solution was analyzed using ion chromatography mic 2 metrohm che the cl concentration of soil pore water c s mg l 1 was then calculated as 1 c s c v o θ g m ρ where c is the cl concentration of the solute mg l 1 v o is the volume of solution 30 ml θ g is the gravimetric water content g g 1 m is the mass of the oven dried soil sample 3 g and ρ is the water density 1 g cm 3 the second subsample 200 g was sealed in polyethylene bottles and used to extract soil water for determination of its stable isotopic composition and for the measurement of soil particle composition soil particle size distribution was measured by a mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd gbr and characterized according to the international soil science society classification scheme soil water was extracted using a cryogenic vacuum distillation instrument li 2000 beijing lica ltd chn a total of 24 daily rainwater samples were collected from a rain gauge between april 1 and august 17 2018 at the changwu agro ecological experiment station all water samples were sealed in glass vials and refrigerated at 4 c for further stable isotope analysis stable isotopic compositions of the rainwater and soil water samples were analyzed using an isotopic liquid water analyzer liwa 912 0050 lgr inc usa each sample was injected six times but the first two injections were discarded to eliminate memory effects the average for injections 3 6 was used for the isotope ratio calculation results are expressed as δ values relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow in per mil the precision of the instrument is 0 4 for δd and 0 1 for δ 18o 2 3 estimating recharge the chloride mass balance cmb allison and hughes 1978 edmunds et al 1988 method has been used successfully to estimate the recharge rate of groundwater in rain fed areas scanlon et al 2006 stone and edmunds 2016 especially in the lpc gates et al 2011 huang et al 2013 2017 li et al 2017 lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 the potential recharge rate r mm yr 1 beneath farmland can be calculated as 2 r p c p c s where p is mean annual precipitation mm c p and c s are the mean cl concentrations in precipitation and soil water below the root zone mg l 1 respectively long term records of wet and dry deposition of cl are essential to estimate recharge using the cmb method the volume weighted average cl concentration in rainfall was 1 0 mg l 1 which was obtained from a rural eanet monitoring station jiwozi xi an eanet 2020 located approximately 100 km east of the study area between 2000 and 2018 dry deposition may contribute as much as 10 33 of the total cl input huang et al 2017 here we assumed that dry deposition was equal to 20 of the wet deposition thus the total c p was 1 2 mg l 1 using these values of wet and dry deposition the annual cl input from the atmosphere was estimated to be 698 mg m 2 yr 1 582 mm yr 1 1 2 mg l 1 the infiltration velocity i mm yr 1 can be calculated as 3 i r θ v where r is the recharge rate and θ v is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 the cmb method assumes that the only source of cl is atmospheric contributions of cl from weathering and surface runoff are negligible and the one dimensional 1 d vertical steady state cl flux is tenable huang et al 2020 this is particularly suited to the farmland where the rooting depth is generally less than 3 m li et al 2018 however the cmb cannot be used to estimate the potential recharge rate under the ponds because surface runoff from the villages from different times are mixed in the ponds making the flow below the pond transient however the peak depth method can be used to estimate the potential recharge rate under the ponds in this case the potential recharge rate r mm yr 1 beneath a pond is calculated as 4 r 0 l θ v d z δ t and the infiltration velocity is calculated as 5 i l δ t where l is the distance mm moved by the peak in the trace concentration over a period of time δt yr θ v is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 at depth z the cmb method is unsuitable for deep rooted vegetation such as apple trees because a new steady state is not established in the unsaturated zone huang and pang 2011 in order to estimate the potential recharge rate under apple orchards zhang et al 2018 developed a method based on eq 1 6 r d r s δ s δ t where r d is the recharge rate under deep rooted vegetation e g apple trees r s is the recharge rate under shallow rooted vegetation crops obtained by eq 1 δs is the deficit of soil water storage under the apple orchard relative to the cropland and δt is the age of the apple trees the soil water storage can be calculated as 7 s 0 h θ v d z where s is the soil water storage in the soil to a certain depth h θ v is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 at depth z 2 4 contributions from two forms of recharge if focused recharge and diffusive recharge are considered as possible recharge forms then the contributions of focused and diffusive recharge to groundwater recharge can be estimated as 8 c f c d r f r d a f a d r f a f r d a d where c f and c d are the contributions of focused recharge and diffusive recharge to groundwater recharge respectively r f is the average recharge rate beneath the catchment of the pond in the village r d is the recharge rate of diffusive recharge a f is the catchment area of the pond and a d is the area of diffusive recharge 3 results 3 1 soil characteristics and soil water contents below village ponds farmlands and orchards the average clay 0 002 mm silt 0 002 0 02 mm and sand 0 02 2 mm contents in the l2 loess profile were 30 6 2 9 34 5 2 4 and 34 9 4 6 respectively fig 3a according to the international union of soil science iuss classification scheme loess can be classified as silt loam because loess profile has little horizontal variability in soil texture across the changwu tableland lu et al 2020 we can assume that soil texture profile at l2 represents that of l1 l3 and l4 soil water contents swc fluctuated with depth through the loess profile fig 3b the fluctuations were generally consistent with the clay content variations however beneath l4 the fluctuations were attenuated and swcs decreased in deeper layers of the apple trees fig 3b the average values of θ v were 0 358 0 288 0 281 and 0 203 cm3 cm 3 for the four sites l1 l2 l3 and l4 respectively the swcs in the root zone or zone of water recycling stone and edmunds 2016 was highly variable because of differing water input precipitation runoff soil evaporation and water uptake by plants long term monitoring experiments in the changwu loess tableland cheng and liu 2014 cheng et al 2014 show that the depth of the water recycling zone commonly extends 4 m below the ground surface swcs below the recycling zone mainly affected by land cover were relatively stable over time for farmland cheng et al 2014a cheng and liu 2014 but decreased with increasing age of the apple tree stands for apple orchards li et al 2019 thus the swcs below 4 m within l2 were similar to that of l3 but were greater than that of l4 in addition l1 had the highest swc among the four sites and its swc was always greater than the field capacity this provided a necessary condition for the rapid downward movement of soil water under the influence of gravity 3 2 chloride concentrations in pore water below the village pond farmland and orchard there was a peak cl concentration at depths of 1 2 2 4 m beneath l2 and l3 but three zones of high cl concentrations were present beneath l4 at depths of 0 4 0 6 m 2 4 2 6 m and 4 5 m fig 4a the high cl concentrations near the ground surface were a result of intensive use of cl containing fertilizers in apple orchards in the region since the 1980 s huang et al 2019b lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 therefore the cl concentrations of pore water were high and varied greatly with depth in the upper part of the loess profile 0 6 m however they were low and varied little within the deeper profile fig 4a table 1 beneath l2 l3 and l4 both the cl profiles and the 1963 tritium peak fig 4b in the homogeneous loess profile reflected the piston flow dominated vertical downward movement of soil water beneath croplands and orchards huang et al 2019a li et al 2018 lin and wei 2006 lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 however l1 did not have any cl peak within the loess profile and had the lowest cl concentration among the four sites the low cl concentration beneath l1 typically suggests that there has been a rapid movement of soil water as well as large water fluxes which led to a reduced effect of evaporation and enhanced leaching on soil water 3 3 stable isotope profiles in pore water below the village pond farmland and orchard l2 l3 and l4 had similar vertical distributions of the stable isotopes in the profile the δ 18o values ranged from 10 6 to 5 9 and the δ 2h values ranged from 81 8 to 46 9 within the recycling zone within the deeper zone isotopic values were less variable between 10 5 and 7 8 for δ 18o between 75 9 and 61 5 for δ 2h beneath l2 as well as l3 and l4 fig 5a b this is consistent with the understanding that the isotopic contents of soil water varied greatly in the recycling zone due to the effects of rainfall infiltration and soil evaporation but became relatively constant with time in the deeper layers of the profile cheng et al 2014 sprenger et al 2016 xiang et al 2021 the reason for this is that under relatively slow vertical soil water movement diffusion and dispersion processes attenuate seasonal or annual variations in isotopic values within the deep unsaturated zone allison 1988 clark and fritz 1997 however the isotopic values beneath l1 differed from the other sites the stable isotopes varied significantly with depth under l1 the δ 18o values ranged from 16 6 to 7 7 whereas the δ 2h values ranged from 117 8 to 56 7 fig 5a b the comparison of the variations in stable isotopes within the profile beneath l1 and the temporal variations in stable isotopes in rainwater from july to august show that the data correlate fig 5 further the isotopic signals of precipitation were preserved in the loess profile beneath l1 these trends imply that soil water moves downward by piston flow and at a faster velocity than would be expected from diffusion and dispersion of isotopic signals 3 4 comparison of stable isotopes in precipitation soil water and groundwater the soil water δ 18o and δ 2h values for l1 plot on the local meteoric water line lmwl and retained the isotopic characteristics of precipitation measured in july and august 2018 fig 6 thus deep soil water beneath l1 consisted of recharged water with little evaporation because of rapid infiltration with a few exceptions soil water isotopic data collected beneath l2 l3 and l4 plot below the lmwl suggesting that the stable isotopes in soil water were enriched by evaporation the variation in groundwater isotopic compositions was smaller than that of soil water in general the isotopic values of groundwater were located at the lower left of that of soil water beneath the cropland and apple orchards but were located on the upper right of that of soil water beneath the pond fig 6 this suggests that groundwater may be recharged by a mixture of the two kinds of soil water water from beneath the pond and water from beneath the cropland and apple orchards although soil water at all sites moved downward by piston flow the water below the pond moved downward much faster than the soil water below cropland and apple orchards due in part to the large differences in water input the groundwater stable isotopic compositions are similar to that of precipitation during the rainy season july september fig 6 indicating that groundwater was recharged by intense rainfall from july to september this is also supported by previous studies cheng et al 2014 huang et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 3 5 estimated recharge from the village pond cropland and orchards 3 5 1 village pond the isotopic signal of precipitation on july 11 was detected at the depth of 11 5 m in the loess profile fig 5 because the depth of the pond was 2 m the depth of 11 5 m was corrected to 9 5 m the average infiltration velocity between july 11 and august 17 was 26 cm d 1 as estimated by eq 5 suggesting that it would take 115 346 days for a rainfall event to reach the water table at a depth of 30 90 m the soil water storage between the depths of 2 0 11 5 m was 3389 mm and the average recharge rate from july 11 to august 17 as calculated by eq 4 was 92 mm d 1 the area of the pond was about 750 m2 whereas the catchment area of the pond was about 36 400 m2 therefore the average groundwater recharge rate beneath the catchment of the pond in the village was 70 mm 3389 750 36 400 from july 11 to august 17 this accounted for 42 4 of the precipitation 165 mm between july 11 and august 17 if this ratio represents the average ratio during the entire wet season july to september and the average annual precipitation during the rainy season was 316 mm 1959 2018 the average groundwater recharge rate was 134 mm yr 1 316 43 1 beneath the catchment of the pond in the village this accounted for 23 1 of the annual precipitation it is important to note however that because the sampling site was at the edge of the pond i e not in the pond the actual recharge rate and infiltration velocity beneath the pond is likely to be greater than the calculated values 3 5 2 cropland the long term average groundwater recharge under l2 was quantified based on the cmb method to further exclude the potential impacts of fertilizer application the cl concentrations below the depth of 8 m were adopted as has been done in previous studies in the same area li et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the weighted average pore water cl concentration in the profile below 8 m was 23 4 mg l 1 beneath l2 from 8 to 29 m the groundwater recharge rate as calculated by eq 2 was 30 mm yr 1 and accounted for 5 2 of the annual precipitation the average volumetric water content below 8 m was 0 291 cm3 cm 3 and the infiltration velocity as calculated by eq 3 was 10 3 cm yr 1 the tritium peak corresponds to the tritium in precipitation in 1963 which still remains in the loess profiles fig 4b huang et al 2019a li et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 tao et al 2021 in 2015 52 years since 1963 tritium peaks at 6 1 6 5 m were clearly detectable beneath the farmland in the changwu tableland li et al 2018 lu et al 2020 therefore the infiltration velocity as calculated by eq 5 was 11 7 12 5 cm yr 1 the average volumetric water content above 6 5 m was 0 264 cm3 cm 3 whereas the recharge rate was 31 33 mm yr 1 as calculated by eq 4 thus recharge accounted for 5 3 5 7 of the mean annual precipitation a recharge rate of 30 33 mm yr 1 was calculated for cropland accounting for 5 2 5 7 of annual precipitation with an infiltration velocity of 10 3 12 5 cm yr 1 on the basis of the cmb and tritium peak methods it would take 240 874 years for a rainfall event to reach the water table at 30 90 m depth below cropland 3 5 3 apple orchards the conversion from farmland to apple orchards has led to soil water depletion and cl accumulation in the soil profiles huang and pang 2011 zhang et al 2018 for example between a depth of 6 and 11 m the depletion of water storage beneath l4 was 667 mm as compared to the l2 the weighted averaged cl concentration was 21 7 mg l 1 beneath l2 and 55 2 mg l 1 beneath l4 however a new steady state condition beneath the apple orchard may not have been reached because the rooting depth beneath a mature apple orchard was 23 m li et al 2019 resulting in cl accumulation to greater depths in the profile soil water storage values beneath l2 l3 and l4 were 4905 4802 and 3226 mm for the profile between 4 and 21 m beneath the water recycling zone respectively compared to l2 the water storage deficit of l3 and l4 were 103 mm and 1679 mm respectively consequently a reduction in soil water storage beneath l3 and l4 were 11 mm yr 1 and 62 mm yr 1 respectively the potential groundwater recharge rate under the apple orchards using eq 6 was zero for the mature apple orchard but was 19 22 mm yr 1 for the young apple orchard the reason for the difference may be that the young apple trees consume less water and thus may be comparable to cropland during the first few years li et al 2018 4 discussion 4 1 recharge mechanisms as also suggested by previous studies rainwater is the only recharge source for shallow groundwater in the loess tableland cheng et al 2014 huang et al 2019a huang et al 2019b tan et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 however the mechanism of water flow piston or preferential flow remains controversial for example the 1963 tritium peak in the loess profile confirms the existence of piston flow huang et al 2019a 2019b li et al 2018 lin and wei 2006 lu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 and the undetectable 3h in the groundwater samples indicates that piston flow was the sole recharge mechanism in some studies huang et al 2019a 2017 if this is representative of the region the time required for precipitation to reach the water table will range from decades to hundreds of years therefore groundwater will be pre modern or paleo water within an integrated tableland huang et al 2019a 2017 however other studies reported different phenomena an obvious increase in water table elevation due to precipitation was observed during the rainy season yan 1986 yan and wang 1983 and dynamic changes in groundwater isotopic values although smaller than in precipitation were consistent with that of precipitation huang et al 2019b these changes confirm that groundwater is also recharged by rapid flow from precipitation and that groundwater may include both modern and paleo waters huang et al 2019b xiang et al 2019 the occurrence of such rapid flow was also supported by the detection of 3h in groundwater samples in a few previous studies huang et al 2019b li et al 2017 lin and wei 2006 song et al 2017 tan et al 2017 the dual flow mechanism of water flow resulted in differing stable o and h isotopic compositions between deep soil water and groundwater cheng et al 2014 li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 the above mentioned studies all employed environmental tracers e g 2h 18o 3h cl no3 and 13c yet inconsistent conclusions were obtained regarding the mechanisms of soil water flow in the loess tableland this may be because all previous studies only focused on groundwater recharge beneath cropland orchards and grassland and did not consider recharge beneath village ponds the cropland orchards and grasslands are flat due to long term tillage possessing negligible surface runoff and no visible depressions liu et al 2010 thus diffusive recharge through the unsaturated zone in the loess tableland is the only recharge mechanism under farmland orchards and grasslands fig 7 the diffusive recharge featuring a stable annual recharge rate 30 33 mm yr 1 and a slow infiltration velocity 10 3 12 5 mm yr 1 is supported by previous studies huang et al 2019a 2017 2019b lu et al 2020 however there are many low lying areas and water channels in villages including ponds surface runoff from roads and courtyards generated from intense monsoonal rainfalls collects in those ponds in the villages these village ponds create favorable conditions for focused recharge fig 7 our study first measured the stable 18o and 2h isotopic compositions and cl concentrations of the loess profile along the bank of a village pond the isotopic data demonstrate that focused recharge also occurs by infiltration in the form of piston like flow fig 5 unlike piston flow associated with diffusive recharge the piston flow in the form of focused recharge has a greater infiltration velocity 26 cm d 1 this rapid piston flow is very likely the preferential flow that was inferred by previous studies huang et al 2019b xiang et al 2019 the current study showed that the time needed for precipitation to reach the water table by the focused recharge ranged from several days to months which explains why 1 the water table responded to intense rainfall much earlier than expected yan 1986 yan and wang 1983 2 the dynamic changes of isotopic compositions of groundwater were consistent with that of precipitation huang et al 2019b and 3 the stable isotopic compositions differed between groundwater and deep soil water beneath farmland and orchards cheng et al 2014 li et al 2017 xiang et al 2019 4 2 accuracy of estimated recharge 4 2 1 focused recharge the focused recharge rate under villages has not been documented in previous studies in the lpc thus the data presented here are novel and of benefit to our understanding of groundwater recharge the swcs within the loess profile under the pond was always greater than the field capacity indicating that soil water moves downward in gravity driven near saturated flow our results show that the calculated infiltration velocity was 26 cm d 1 the simulated saturated hydraulic conductivity within 0 25 2 m of the loess profile as determined by a hydrus 1d model was 6 4 37 3 cm d 1 in the study area li 2019 given the average volumetric water content is 0 358 cm3 cm 3 the most resistant layer will have a saturated flow velocity under unit gradient to be 22 9 cm d 1 thus our measured infiltration velocity 26 cm d 1 was similar to the infiltration velocity estimated from the simulated saturated hydraulic conductivity of the loess sediments under unit hydraulic gradient this further supports the estimated infiltration rate and thus the focused recharge rate under the pond in this study 4 2 2 diffusive recharge because the cmb method is highly sensitive to cl inputs p c p and the cl concentration in soil water c s eq 1 the accuracy of the estimated long term recharge rate was limited by uncertainties in cl input and cl concentrations in soil water fouty 1989 assuming a 10 20 error in the cl input and cl concentrations in soil water the total error for the groundwater recharge derived from eq 1 is 23 huang and pang 2011 due to the lack of long term monitoring data of cl concentration in precipitation c p in most areas of the loess plateau the volume weighted average c p from a rural monitoring station jiwozi near xi an eanet in the southern part of the loess plateau has been used in previous studies however the values of c p differ between studies because of the specific years selected they range from 1 0 to 1 7 mg l 1 table 2 the values of c s also differ between studies the differences in c s table 2 reflect spatial variations in the properties of the loess deposits in different districts and the method of extracting cl from soil which is key to measurement of cl in the solute as analyzed by ion chromatography in this study cl was extracted from soil using a 3 6 mmol l 1 na2co3 4 5 mmol l 1 nahco3 solution which is more effective wang et al 2010 due to the complementary ion effect of the exchangeable ions due to the uncertainties of c p and c s the estimated recharge rate in the literature for the lpc ranges from 2 to 22 of the average annual precipitation table2 the estimated recharge rate in this study was 30 33 mm yr 1 for cropland accounting for 5 2 5 7 of annual precipitation this estimate falls within the range reported in the literature 4 3 contributions of focused and diffusive recharge the loess tableland region is a traditional farming area where the main land use types are agricultural and residential although historically there have been a few other land use types the conversion of large areas of farmlands to apple orchards in the region began in the 1990 s because of their ability to yield a higher economic income cheng et al 2016 therefore at present there are three dominant land use types residential land farmland and apple orchards which account for 24 44 and 32 of the area of the changwu tableland respectively apple trees tend to consume more water and the soil water deficit significantly increases with tree age suggesting that the conversion of farmlands to apple orchards limits the diffusive recharge to groundwater this is supported by the work of huang et al 2019b zhang et al 2018 and the similar phenomena were also recorded in the argentine pampas the eucalyptus camaldulensis plantation which reduced groundwater recharge and depressed the water table 38 cm on average compared to the adjacent grassland in two years jobbágy and jackson 2004 due to very low infiltration velocities 10 3 12 5 cm yr 1 below these deep rooted orchards the apparent impacts on actual groundwater recharge will be shown in the future li et al 2018 huang et al 2019b the area of the ponds was 503 m2 per km2 during the 1960s but decreased to 171 m2 per km2 in 2014 in the changwu loess tableland region yang et al 2014 this is equivalent to a reduction of 34 this means that the catchment area of the ponds along with surface runoff must have declined causing the focused recharge rate to decrease assuming that the decrease in the percentage of catchment area was same as the ponds area the contributions of focused recharge and diffusive recharge to groundwater recharge estimated by eq 8 are 32 45 and 55 68 respectively table 3 thus diffusive recharge is the main form of groundwater recharge which is consistent with previous isotope studies by huang et al 2019b xiang et al 2019 huang et al 2019b found that diffusive recharge accounted for 53 69 of the total recharge whereas xiang et al 2019 showed that diffusive recharge contributed 62 8 to the total recharge in the loess tableland region 4 4 implications to groundwater resource sustainability focused recharge and diffusive recharge coexist in the loess tableland region however diffusive recharge diminishes by the conversion of croplands to apple orchards whereas focused recharge reduces with the number of ponds destroyed by new rural construction new rural construction along with improved pumping capacity also led to the increased pumping of shallow groundwater the combination of diminished recharge and increased pumping lead to groundwater depletion thereby potentially threatening the sustainable utilization of groundwater resources in the loess tableland region therefore to ensure a sustainable groundwater supply it is important to enhance focused recharge beneath the village ponds and to implement rotation between croplands and apple in order to keep a reasonable areal ratio of orchards to cropland we suggest land use planners 1 to increase village pond protection by avoiding the removal of ponds in the process of road and housing construction and 2 to build new ponds to receive runoff during new rural construction to avoid runoff being discharged directly into the valleys 5 conclusions it is important to understand and quantify recharge mechanisms for the sustainable management of groundwater resources in this study stable isotopes 2h and 18o and cl were used to determine the groundwater recharge mechanisms and evaluated the recharge rate and infiltration velocity at different sites in the changwu loess tableland we developed a conceptual model for recharge processes in the loess tableland although piston flow dominates groundwater recharge in the loess tableland the tableland region can be divided into two hydrological units the first unit includes farmlands orchards grasslands and similar land cover types and the second unit includes ponds and other low lying areas in villages in the first unit groundwater recharge is characterized by diffusive recharge and the infiltration velocity was 10 3 12 5 cm yr 1 in the second unit groundwater recharge is mainly characterized by focused recharge beneath village ponds and the mean infiltration velocity was 26 cm d 1 during the rainy season diffusive recharge contributed 55 68 to the total recharge while focused recharge contributed 32 45 however the conversion of croplands to apple orchards limits diffusive recharge whereas decreasing the number of village ponds limits focused recharge both lead to groundwater depletion these findings suggest that we should protect recover and reconstruct village ponds to ensure groundwater recharge as well as to limit the conversion of large areas of farmland to apple orchards in the region to ensure the sustainable utilization of
