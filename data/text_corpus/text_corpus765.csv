3825,fractures faults karstic features and or interbedded layers of coarse sediment often manifest in the form of preferential flow features pffs previous investigations into the effects of pffs on solute plume distributions within otherwise permeable host rocks have treated flow in pffs as darcian however flow through faults and fractures is known to exhibit non darcian flow behavior the current study extends previous investigations of the effects of pffs e g a fault or fracture on solute plumes in permeable aquifers that assume darcian flow in the fault fracture the finite element model comsol multiphysics was applied to examine how non darcian flow in a single pff influences flow fields and steady state solute plume distributions in permeable aquifers compared with the darcian flow assumption the forchheimer equation was applied within numerical models to represent flow in the pff for a variety of pff permeability contrasts pff apertures and matrix flow directions the refraction of flow lines at matrix pff interfaces and the specific discharge in the pff were found to be smaller in non darcian models leading to larger peak solute concentrations by up to 160 and narrower plumes compared to darcian models in addition the impact of non darcian flow on flow fields and solute plumes was greater with smaller matrix hydraulic conductivity larger pff aperture and larger incidence angle at the matrix pff interface upstream dispersion at the matrix pff interface observed in previous matrix pff studies of solute transport as the result of steep solute concentration gradients opposing head gradients was found to be reduced when non darcian flow was considered in pffs this study highlights that non darcian flow effects may be significant in the

effect pff preferential flow feature 1 introduction naturally occurring porous media commonly contain heterogeneities in the form of thin layers of higher permeability relative to the host matrix manifested as fractures faults karstic features and or interbedded layers of coarse sediments bear et al 1993 berkowitz 2002 collectively referred to herein as preferential flow features pffs these lead to modifications to flow and solute transport that are often represented by anisotropy in aquifer hydraulic properties when the investigation scale is significantly large however the hydraulic conductivity of a pff kf m s and that of the host matrix km m s may differ by orders of magnitude leading to flow fields that are not adequately reproduced by homogenized anisotropic models thereby inhibiting their ability to correctly simulate solute transport behavior long et al 1982 kessler and hunt 1994 vujević et al 2014 sebben et al 2015 the effects of pffs have been recognized and investigated within various contexts including flow and or solute transport in karst aquifers e g scanlon et al 2003 fractured coastal aquifers e g giudici et al 2012 lim et al 2013 and mining activities within fractured rock systems e g wang et al 2021 scanlon et al 2003 assessed the use of equivalent porous media epm models in exploring flow within a karst aquifer system by comparing the epm s outputs with monitoring data the epm was found to reproduce reasonably well the temporal variations of discharge but failed to reproduce groundwater flow rates and directions lim et al 2013 used geochemical and isotopic indicators to assess seawater intrusion within a fractured aquifer system pffs appeared to contribute significantly to the pattern of salinization within seepage waters laboratory experiments have also been used to quantify the influence of pffs on flow and solute migration in otherwise porous aquifers haldeman et al 1991 sonnenborg et al 1999 wendland and himmelsbach 2002 roels et al 2003 sharma and dixit 2014 for example sonnenborg et al 1999 created pffs by juxtaposing manufactured permeable blocks to investigate flow and solute transport in fractured media discrete fracture network dfn models were used to simulate experimental breakthrough curves compared with the models that used mean apertures for the pff the models with spatial variations in pff apertures were found to better describe the experimental observations and mass exchange between pffs and the rock matrix wendland and himmelsbach 2002 investigated solute migration in a fractured sedimentary rock using pyranine as a tracer based on the experiment analyses and corresponding numerical simulations they found that matrix diffusion played a non negligible role in solute migration acting to retard solute transport within the pff previous field and laboratory studies indicate that a proper understanding of the role of pffs in controlling flow and solute transport in porous media is an important requirement for improving the characterization of contaminant transport in highly heterogeneous settings odling and roden 1997 sebben and werner 2016b while there is a considerable body of numerical and laboratory research on flow within pffs the focus has mainly been on solute transport within pffs in otherwise impermeable rock where solute exchange between the pff and the impermeable matrix occurs only by molecular diffusion into the matrix s immobile porosity e g grisak and pickens 1980 sudicky and frind 1982 wendland and himmelsbach 2002 dejam et al 2014 however where pffs are embedded into otherwise permeable aquifers solute transport within and between the matrix and the pff is expected to occur through advection mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion birkhölzer et al 1993b thus consideration of these transport processes is necessary in studying pffs embedded in otherwise permeable materials several previous studies have examined flow and solute transport in aquifers comprising permeable matrixes and pff networks using primarily numerical and analytical modelling techniques rubin and buddemeier 1996 compared the flow and solute distributions from an epm model with those from a dfn model for a permeable matrix embedded with two sets of oblique and parallel fractures they found that some epm models needed the transverse dispersivity αt m to be larger than the longitudinal dispersivity αl m to reasonably represent the solute distributions obtained from the dfn models odling and roden 1997 included naturally occurring pff geometries in their investigation of flow and solute transport in fractured porous matrixes thereby considering a wider range of pff networks than previously considered they found that fracture connectivity was as important as the pff orientation and spacing in controlling the transport of contaminant plumes willmann et al 2013 developed a particle tracking method to examine pffs embedded within a permeable matrix where advection and diffusion were considered in both the pffs and the surrounding matrix mass exchange at the pff matrix interface was dependent on the fracture aperture the flux perpendicular to the interface and diffusion ronayne 2013 examined solute transport in three dimensional synthetic karst systems with branching pff networks and a permeable matrix using numerical modeling it was shown that a more convoluted fracture network can enhance conduit matrix mixing resulting in a wider variation of solute arrival times studies analyzing pff matrix behavior at the scale of an individual pff arose from the need to better understand the processes through which pffs modify contaminant plumes in permeable matrixes this is particularly important where the flow direction within the host matrix is oblique to the pff orientation for example houseworth et al 2013 obtained a closed form analytical solution for steady state two dimensional 2d flow and solute transport in a permeable matrix containing a single pff flow in the matrix was presumed to be oblique to the pff orientation but sufficiently slow to neglect mechanical dispersion in the matrix sebben and werner 2016a used 2d numerical modeling to add to the analysis of houseworth et al 2013 by considering mechanical dispersion in the matrix in otherwise comparable conceptual models they analyzed the influence of a single pff on steady state solute distributions in rock matrixes of moderate to high hydraulic conductivity km of 10 6 to 5 10 3 m s e g sandstone and limestone containing pffs apertures of 0 25 10 3 to 0 5 10 3 m assumed to be open fully mixed and oblique to the flow direction in the matrix the solute plume originated from a point source upstream of the pff sebben and werner 2016a found that the influence of the pff on solute plume distributions is mainly determined by the host rock to pff hydraulic conductivity ratio km kf and by the distance from the solute source to the pff diluted and more asymmetric solute plumes were obtained from lower values of km kf sebben and werner 2016b built on the pff study of sebben and werner 2016a by evaluating the effects of barrier flow features i e bffs which are less permeable than the host matrix and the parameters 2b aperture of pffs or bffs m and kf on solute plumes in otherwise similar conditions to those assessed by sebben and werner 2016a bffs were presumed to arise due to lithology changes such as clay layers embedded in sand sandstone aquifers or from in filling of fractures with low permeability materials in fractured rock settings they adopted km of 10 5 m s and kf of 10 7 to 10 3 m s apertures of 2 5 10 4 to 0 02 m and included a simple analytical expression for the orthogonal displacement of flow lines caused by either pffs or bffs their investigation of bffs found that bffs produced weaker and contrasting influences on solute displacement and plume symmetry compared to pffs for example whereas pffs reduce the peak solute concentration and lead to downstream displacement of solute plumes bffs lead to higher peak solute concentrations relative to the situation of no pff and upstream displacement of solute plumes beneath bffs sebben and werner 2016b also found that larger values of 2b lead to lower peak solute concentrations and wider more asymmetric solute plumes in cases involving pffs while bff simulations also produced wider plumes with increased 2b but plume asymmetry was not influenced significantly by 2b robinson and werner 2017 presented an analytical solution for the passage of a solute plume through a permeable aquifer containing a single fault or facture whereby the mechanical dispersion was taken into consideration both in the host matrix and the pff or bff thereby building on the solution of houseworth et al 2013 who neglected mechanical dispersion in their solution robinson and werner s 2017 solution overcomes the grid resolution and scale issues encountered by sebben and werner 2016a 2016b and thereby allows for effectively infinite domain sizes to be considered without the computational constraints of numerical approaches the aforementioned studies represented pffs using darcy s law e g houseworth et al 2013 sebben and werner 2016a sebben and werner 2016b robinson and werner 2017 however flow in a single pff open channel or filled with porous material may become non darcian whereby the flow is no longer linearly proportional to the hydraulic gradient kohl et al 1997 wen et al 2006 qian et al 2015 non darcian flow arises when inertial effects are non negligible basak 1976 soni et al 1978 dudgeon 1985 zimmerman et al 2004 and has been observed in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes şen 1987 qian et al 2005 wen et al 2014 the transition between laminar and turbulent flow regimes is linked to the reynolds number re given by bear et al 1993 1 re 2bq v where q m s is the specific discharge and v m2 s is the kinematic viscosity the fracture aperture 2b is taken as the characteristic length for assessing flow conditions within pffs qian et al 2015 used laboratory experiments to evaluate the transition from darcian to non darcian flow in an artificial single fracture where the fracture was filled by coarse sand the forchheimer equation was used to fit the experimental data and inertial and viscous terms were compared to evaluate the magnitude of non darcian flow behavior the authors observed non darcian flow when re approached or exceeded 3 zimmerman et al 2004 observed non darcian flow in replicas of natural fractures unfilled at re values of 1 although many experimental and numerical studies have examined the criterion for non darcian flow in porous media and obtained corresponding expressions and values for specific subsurface properties at which transition may occur chilton and colburn 1931 green and duwez 1951 ma and ruth 1993 qian et al 2015 there is not general criteria for the occurrence of non darcian flow in porous media and rather published thresholds for the transition from darcian to non darcian flow in porous media are inconsistent zeng and grigg 2006 previous studies of permeable aquifers containing pffs have not attempted to evaluate the degree to which non darcian flow may influence flow fields and solute plume distributions despite that non darcian flow in the pff is likely to occur under natural conditions yang et al 2018 thus it is currently unclear as to whether the treatment of flow within pffs as darcian flow will lead to significant deviation in terms of predicting the flow field and solute distributions for situations in which non darcian flow occurs within pffs in reality in the pff analysis of sebben and werner 2016b an anomalous upstream dispersion effect termed back dispersion effect bde by the authors was observed whereby solutes moved against the groundwater flow direction in the host rock on the upstream side of the pff the bde was attributed to steep concentration gradients and macroscopic dispersion parameters leading to artificially intensified solute movement localized to the upstream side of the pff bdes have been recognized in other studies of solute transport including in homogeneous media al niami and rushton 1977 marino 1978 kumar 1983 konikow 2011 irvine et al 2021 liu et al 2004 also encountered a bde in solute transport models involving three dimensional heterogeneous systems characterized by a dendritic network of pffs both liu et al 2004 and sebben and werner 2016b found that larger values of km kf resulted in less pronounced bdes in the matrix upstream of pffs this study aims to investigate non darcian flow in pffs embedded within permeable host rocks and its effect on flow fields and solute plume distributions within both the pff and host rocks in this way the current investigation extends the works of houseworth et al 2013 sebben and werner 2016a 2016b and robinson and werner 2017 who adopted darcian flow in the pff in their analyses of steady state solute plume distributions originating from within the host rock and subsequently intercepting the pff a key factor under consideration is the extent of the anomalous bde observed in previous studies that presume darcian flow in the pff 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual model and experimental procedure the conceptual model adopted in this study follows that of sebben and werner 2016a i e a 2d domain i e horizontal planar of size 1 m 1 m as shown in fig 1 a single horizontal open channel pff was placed in the middle of the domain i e the lower face of the pff is located at y 0 5 m the boundary conditions along all four sides are specified heads that are linear functions of distance as indicated in fig 1 that is h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 refer to the hydraulic heads at the four vertices through which the angle of incidence at the matrix pff interface θm and the hydraulic gradient in the matrix can be modulated the head drop from h 1 to h 2 equals the head drop from h 4 to h 3 and the head drop from h 1 to h 4 equals the head drop from h 2 to h 3 a solute source with continuous flux fm mol m s is added at location x y 0 1 m 0 55 2b m that is the distance from the solute source to the upper face of the pff is 0 05 m for different 2b conditions similar to the value of 0 048 m that was used by sebben and werner 2016b sensitivity analysis was used to assess the influence of non darcian effects ndes on flow fields and steady state solute plume distributions this was achieved by comparing the results of darcian models dms within which pff flow was assumed to be darcian and non darcian models fms within which flow in the pff was assumed to be non darcian as represented by the forchheimer equation sensitivity analysis simulations adopted various values for km 2b and θm the values of parameters used within sensitivity analysis simulation cases are listed in table 1 the same km values as those adopted by sebben and werner 2016a were adopted in the current study as cases a to e with the exception of their lowest value of km 10 6 m s for which we were unable to obtain reliable results due to numerical instabilities km values ranging from 10 5 m s to 10 3 m s are typical of unfractured un karstified limestone geiger et al 2010 webb et al 2010 preliminary simulations showed that both reducing dispersivity and considering ndes rather than assuming darcian flow lead to narrower plume widths thus the values for dispersivity used by sebben and werner 2016a were adopted in the current study additional sensitivity analysis of dispersivity was conducted for three simulation cases to compare the plume distribution variations caused by changing dispersivity and taking ndes into account in the pff results are briefly shown in the discussion section values for the solute flux fm were also the same as those used by sebben and werner 2016a as listed in table 1 such that the maximum solute concentration at the source location is approximately 1 mol m3 in each model this allows concentrations to be considered as a fraction of the maximum concentration i e 0 1 mol m3 is 10 of the maximum source solute concentration for each of the cases given in table 1 three scenarios were created and assessed using values for 2b of 2 5 10 4 m scenario 1 5 10 4 m scenario 2 and 1 10 3 m scenario 3 thus the simulation cases and scenarios were labelled as a1 a2 a3 b1 e2 e3 where the letter a to e indicates the km case and the number 1 to 3 refers to the pff aperture 2b scenario as shown in table 2 e g scenario c2 has km 5 10 4 m s and 2b 5 10 4 m the value of 2b 5 10 4 m used for scenario 2 is the same as the 2b value used by sebben and werner 2016a the range of 2b values represents medium sized fractures e g 10 4 m to 10 3 m birkhölzer et al 1993a sonnenborg et al 1999 geiger et al 2010 for each case and scenario three flow directions within the matrix θm equal to 30 45 and 60 were also tested these parameter combinations led to 45 simulations for each dm and fm furthermore five matrix only models mo in which the pff is filled with identical material to the matrix i e the pff is absent with km values that are the same as cases a to e were run to assist in assessing the influence of the bde in previous studies that treat open channel pffs as porous media e g birkhölzer et al 1993a willmann et al 2013 sebben and werner 2016a the pff kf value adopted in darcian models is calculated by the cubic law expressed as 2 k f 2 b 2 ρ g 12 μ where g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity ρ kg m3 is fluid density and μ kg m s is dynamic viscosity the values of 2b used in the current study lead to kf 0 051 m s 0 204 m s and 0 817 m s for scenarios 1 to 3 respectively sebben and werner 2016a found km kf to be the main factor controlling the solute distribution based on analyses of km kf values ranging from 4 9 10 6 to 2 5 10 2 the various combinations of km and 2b in the current study produce km kf ratios that vary between 1 2 10 5 and 9 8 10 2 as given in table 2 the specific discharge in the matrix qm m s adopted by sebben and werner 2016a 2016b was also used in the current study leading to a hydraulic gradient equal to 0 1414 thus the boundary conditions when θm 30 are 3a h 1 2 0 2 0 05 2 x 3b h 2 3 0 2 0 05 2 0 05 6 y 1 3c h 3 4 0 2 0 05 6 0 05 2 x 3d h 4 1 0 2 0 05 6 y 1 where h 1 2 h 2 3 h 3 4 h 4 1 m indicate hydraulic head distributions along the top right bottom and left boundaries of the domain fig 1 respectively when θm 45 4a h 1 2 0 2 0 1 4b h 2 3 0 1 y 4c h 3 4 0 1 0 1 x 4d h 4 1 0 1 0 1 y when θm 60 5a h 1 2 0 2 0 05 6 x 5b h 2 3 0 2 0 05 6 0 05 2 y 1 5c h 3 4 0 2 0 05 2 0 05 6 x 5d h 4 1 0 2 0 05 2 y 1 the impact of ndes on solute distributions was firstly assessed by examining the 2 d plume distribution difference between each fm and the corresponding dm i e cf cd where c refers to the solute concentration distribution and superscripts f and d indicate non darcian and darcian results respectively plume characteristics were evaluated using similar metrics to those adopted by sebben and werner 2016b as shown in fig 2 which provides the results of the darcian model applied to case b2 km 5 10 3 m s 2b 5 10 4 m with θm 45 for illustrative purpose the change in plume charateristics caused by ndes were analyzed by evaluating 1 the ratio of the fm peak concentration beneath the pff to the corresponding dm value i e cp f cp d here cp is the maximum concentration along the pff bottom boundary shown as the red cross in fig 2 2 differences between dm and fm solute plume widths i e wd wf where w is the solute plume width at y 0 5 m i e along the pff bottom boundary designated by concentrations equal to c 0 10 3 mol m3 see fig 2 and superscipts d and f are as previously 3 differences in plume symmetry wl wr between fms and dms i e wl f wr f wl d wr d where wl is the distance between the locations of c 0 and cp to the left upstream side of c 0 and wr is that on the right downstream side of c 0 as depicted in fig 2 4 the displacement lh of the peak solute concentration representing the distance between the x location of cp and that of cmo i e the peak concentration from a matrix only model as shown in fig 3 the peak concentration displacement between a dm and an fm is determined as lh d lh f where superscipts d and f are as previously upstream dispersion bde was also evaluated by quantifying differences in solute plume distributions between pff models dms and fms and the matrix only model mo in the matrix above i e upstream of the pff 2 2 governing equations for flow and transport and numerical implementation in solving flow and transport within the pff and matrix only conceptual models described above groundwater flow was solved first and solute transport was subsequently resolved using flow velocities as input flow in the matrix was governed by darcy s law whereas pff flow was treated as either darcian or non darcian flow for dms and fms respectively 2d darcy s law can be written in terms of the head gradient as 6 h q k where is the laplace operator h m is hydraulic head k m s is isotropic hydraulic conductivity and q m s is the two dimensional specific discharge the forchheimer equation is used for non darcian flow in the pff which can be expressed as forchheimer 1901 7 h q k β f g q q where βf 1 m is the non darcian coefficient the forchheimer equation has shown good agreement to relationships between the hydraulic gradient and flow velocity observed in laboratory experiments in pffs containing non darcian flow e g qian et al 2015 in applications of the forchheimer equation to open channel pff flow choi et al 1997 set βf to 10g for 2b values between 0 5 mm and 1 mm whereas moutsopoulos 2009 adopted βf values of 16 with 2b 4 mm as obtained by the expression for fully turbulent flow in rough open channel fractures kohl et al 1997 8 β f 1 2 b 15 295 if pff is presumed to contain porous medium βf can be calculated by the commonly used ergun equation li and engler 2001 9 β f a c 0 5 k 0 5 n 1 5 where k m2 is the permeability of the pff n is the porosity of the pff and dimensionless constants have the commonly used values a 1 74 and c 150 takhanov 2011 no widely accepted expression for βf that depends on fracture hydraulic characteristics has been obtained for non darcian laminar flow in unfilled open channel pffs compared to eq 8 eq 9 is more widely used for the non darcian coefficient and is considered a reasonable estimate for the conceptual model of the current study thus eq 9 is applied to both unfilled and filled pffs in the current analysis of non darcian flow whereby porosity values are adopted that reflect porous media i e n 1 or an open channel i e n 1 note that the permeability recognizing that k kρg μ in eq 9 was obtained by the cubic law eq 2 the first and second terms on the right hand side of eq 7 represent components of flow related to viscous forces jv and inertial forces ji respectively that is jv q k and ji β f g q 2 allowing eq 7 to be written as 10 j jv ji where j h is the hydraulic gradient in the direction of flow within the pff the value of ji j indicates the portion of the hydraulic gradient that is dissipated by inertial forces which is presumed here to also represent the ndes on pff flow the magnitude of non darcian effects can be analyzed by evaluating ji j for example when ji j is greater than 0 1 both inertial force and viscous force should be considered thereby requiring consideration of non darcian flow zeng and grigg 2006 when the flows in both the matrix and the pff are darcian hubbert 1940 found that the water flow direction will be refracted at the interface between different porous media the classical law of flow line refraction rumer and shiau 1968 can be described as 11 k m k f tan θ m tan θ f continuity requires that the mass flux on either side of the matrix pff interfaces must be equal leading to continuity of flux normal to the pff orientation additionally the pressure at the matrix pff interface must match both domains thus we used equivalent normal specific discharge and pressure to couple the two domains matrix and pff at the two matrix pff interfaces i e the upper and lower faces of the pff this can be expressed as 12a q nm q nf 12b p m p f 12c q nm q nf where qn m3 s is the fluid flux passing through the pff matrix interface and p pa and qn m s are pressure and normal specific discharge at the pff matrix interface respectively the subscripts m and f refer to the matrix and pff respectively the transport of conservative solute is described by the advection dispersion equation given by 13 c t d c v c where c mol m3 is the solute concentration v m s is the two dimensional flow velocity and recognizing that n v q d dij m2 s is the dispersion tensor which is defined as bear 1972 14 d ij α t v δ ij α l α t v i v j v where δij is the kronecker delta fuction this leads to longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients dl and dt m2 s equal to αlv in the flow direction and αtv in the direction perpendicular to flow respectively the model proposed in this study was simulated using the finite element numerical code comsol multiphysics comsol 2008 which allows for flexibility in the choice of governing equations the equations were solved using the direct solver mumps with default solver values the concentrations of all simulations were evaluated at 90 days similar to sebben and werner 2016a 2016b this proved to be a sufficient length of time for the flow to reach steady state conditions as determined by stable concentrations at model nodes adaptive time stepping in comsol multiphysics was used whereby the initial and maximum time steps were 0 0407 s and 360 s respectively the accuracy of the numerical implementation of the relevant equations within comsol multiphysics was checked using nine cases which were simulated to compare comsol multiphysics s outputs with a numerical modeling by sebben and werner 2016b and b the analytical solution of robinson and werner 2017 detailed model settings and comparison results are provided in the supplemental material which demonstrates that the numerical solution applied in this study is sufficiently accurate in simulating the matrix pff conceptual model at least where the pff is treated as porous medium the re in pffs in the current study ranges from 0 8845 non darcian model with 2b 2 5 10 4 m and θm 30 to 100 1 darcian model with 2b 10 3 m and θm 60 the most widely used re criterion to categorize flow regimes is that of freeze and cherry 1979 who suggest that 1 darcian laminar flow occurs when re 1 2 non darcian laminar flow occurs when 1 re 100 and 3 non darcian turbulent flow occurs when re 100 the same re criterion was adopted by menichino and hester 2014 and is also used here the model domain was discretized into variable sized triangular elements in which the nodal spacing δl m ranged from 2 10 4 m minimum at the solute source to 2 10 3 m at maximum distance from the source grid refinement was imposed near the solute source and the pff to enhance the accuracy of numerical simulation this led to a grid of 380 036 nodes and 758 002 elements for scenario 1 2b 2 5 10 4 m 357 113 nodes and 712 178 elements for scenario 2 2b 5 10 4 m and 347 853 nodes and 693 646 elements for scenario 3 2b 10 3 m the longitudinal and transverse grid péclet numbers are given by pe δl αl and pe δl αt respectively zheng and bennett 2002 pe ranges from 0 04 based on the longitudinal dispersivity near the solute source to 4 based on the transverse dispersivity away from the solute source the upper limit of 4 for pe is widely considered as the limit to avoid numerical oscillation and instabilities voss 1984 zheng and bennett 2002 in order to test the reliability of the model calculations and the domain discretization the mesh resolution of case c2 km 5 10 4 m s 2b 5 10 4 m with θm 45 was decreased to 232 986 nodes and 464 324 elements and increased to 623 233 nodes and 1 243 784 elements to observe changes in the results while other parameters were the same as values given in table 1 it was found that the finer and coarser grids produced peak solute concentration beneath the pff that varied within 0 02 and therefore the discretization adopted herein was considered reasonable 3 results 3 1 qualitative evaluation of non darcian effects on solute distributions fig 4 shows solute distributions for dms and fms when θm 45 for cases b1 b2 and b3 the results indicate that ndes have a minor impact on solute distributions although as 2b increases fms produce more concentrated plumes compared to dms to provide a clearer depiction of the differences between dms and fms i e attributed to ndes solute differences between fms and dms i e cf cd are illustrated in fig 5 which shows the results of 15 simulation pairs fms and dms corresponding results are given in supplemental material fig s2 a and fig s2 b for flow directions θm 30 and θm 60 respectively fig 5 shows that the solute concentrations downstream of the source are influenced by ndes resulting in both positive warm colors and negative cool colors differences in solute concentration whereby positive values of cf cd indicate that dms under estimate solute concentrations that would otherwise occur if flow in the pff is non darcian fig 5 also shows that ndes are influenced by km and 2b for example increasing 2b or reducing km leads to wider regions where ndes are apparent in solute concentrations i e cf cd 0 this is a consequence of wider plumes with smaller km kf or larger 2b consistent with observations by sebben and werner 2016a 2016b widening of the region where cf cd 0 occurs as a shift to the right downstream within the pff with the left boundary of this region remaining approximately in the same location in cases a2 to e2 and a3 to e3 reductions in km i e from top to bottom lead to smaller solute concentrations such that values of cf cd approach zero in cases e1 to e3 as shown in fig 5 the results of cf cd for flow directions θm 30 and θm 60 see supplemental material s2 fig s2 a and fig s2 b respectively show similar general patterns to those presented for θm 45 the range of cf cd is of the same order of magnitude for different θm and therefore θm seems to play only a minor role compared to km and 2b in the maximum and minimum values of cf cd however distributions of cf cd were significantly altered by changes to θm evidenced by differences in regions where ndes are apparent in solute concentrations i e cf cd 0 for alternative θm values i e fig 5 s2 1 and s2 b fig 6 compares solute concentrations along the pff bottom boundary cb between dms and fms for 45 simulation pairs the results indicate that ndes have a minor impact on cb in case a1 as 2b increased from scenario 1 to scenario 3 left to right subplots fig 6 or km reduced from case a to case e top to bottom subplots fig 6 ndes became increasingly significant which lead to greater values of cb for fms compared to dms in the main plume area reflected by the positive values in fig 5 despite that values of cf cd approach zero in case e1 to e3 fig 5 fig 6 indicates that ndes still have a non negligible influence on the solute distribution in these smaller km cases 3 2 non darcian effects on flow within the pff table 3 shows re values associated with pff flow in the dms and fms of the current study specific discharge in the pffs of dms qf d and fms qf f is listed table s3 in supplemental material for the 45 simulation pairs it shows that qf is almost insensitive to km and rather depends principally on kf i e 2b and θm i e boundary conditions thus re is given for the different scenarios and θm in table 3 neglecting alternative values of km although the minimum value of re for dms is 0 9056 i e less than the cutoff of re 1 for laminar darcian flow we presume that all cases may potentially lead to non darcian flow within the pff fig 7 illustrates ndes on pff flow as the ratio of the inertial term to the total hydraulic gradient ji j for fms recalling that inertial forces are represented in the pffs of fms but not in dms values of ji j for scenario 1 2b 2 5 10 4 m are less than 0 06 indicating that viscous forces are dominant under these conditions this is consistent with the corresponding values of re 0 9056 to 1 475 table 3 for scenario 1 in scenarios 2 and 3 ji j was found to be 0 193 0 242 and 0 272 scenario 2 and 0 528 0 583 and 0 614 scenario 3 for θm 30 45 60 respectively as ji j is greater than 0 1 both inertial and viscous forces play a significant role in pff flow in these situations this increased role of inertial forces in scenarios 2 and 3 is reflected by higher values of re i e re 5 826 for those cases as given in table 3 fig 8 shows the specific discharge ratio qf d qf f i e dms versus fms for flow in the pff under different scenarios and with varying θm the values of qf d qf f are larger than 1 indicating that ndes can lead to a smaller qf for fms compared to the corresponding dm the values of qf d qf f are less than 1 061 when 2b 2 5 10 4 m scenario 1 indicating limited ndes for scenario 2 2b 5 10 4 m qf d qf f increases from 1 24 θm 30 to 1 38 θm 60 and increases from 2 12 θm 30 to 2 59 θm 60 for scenario 3 2b 1 10 3 m highlighting the non negligible influence of θm on ndes particularly when 2b is relatively large 2b 5 10 4 m fig 8 also demonstrates that ndes have a greater impact on qf with increasing 2b or θm the results above occur because a portion of the hydraulic gradient is dissipated by the inertial force i e ji j in fig 7 in the pff flow of fms which leads to smaller specific discharge within the pffs of fms compared to dms qf d qf f 1 meanwhile the increased portion of hydraulic dissipation in smaller km from case a to c or larger 2b from scenario 1 to 3 conditions is reflected by the larger value of qf d qf f as shown in fig 8 the influence of ndes on the flow direction within pffs is analyzed by comparing the values of tanθf between dms and fms as presented in table 4 for dms the values of tanθf are equal to the corresponding kf km tanθm that is the flow line refraction across the matrix pff interfaces obeys eq 11 for fms values of tanθf are all smaller than those of dms and therefore the refraction law of eq 11 no longer applies furthermore greater tanθf differences between dms and fms are found with increasing 2b or θm 3 3 quantitative evaluation of non darcian effects on solute plume characteristics 3 3 1 peak solute concentration fig 9 shows the peak concentration ratios between fms and dms cp f cp d at the pff bottom boundary of 45 simulation pairs while corresponding values of cp f and cp d are given in supplemental material table s4 a the values of cp f cp d are greater than 1 in fig 9 which indicates that fms produced larger peak solute concentrations than dms the values of cp f cp d are less than 1 06 in scenario 1 indicating limited impact of ndes on cp as 2b increase the values of cp f cp d are larger than 1 08 and 1 72 in scenarios 2 and 3 respectively results in fig 9 also demonstrate that cases characterized by smaller km or larger θm exhibit greater ndes on cp the increased importance of ndes on cp in larger 2b and θm or smaller km conditions is consistent with the effect of these parameters on ji j fig 7 the results above can be explained by the smaller qf within the pff of fms which causes a weaker dispersive effect than corresponding dms resulting in a more concentrated plume in fms with a larger cp furthermore stronger ndes on qf larger 2b and θm or smaller km as shown in fig 8 result in a higher cp f cp d value fig 5 shows that as km decreased from case a to case e smaller values of cf cd were observed but fig 9 shows that cp f cp d increased this is because as km reduced from case a to case e both lower plume concentrations and a stronger nde impact were produced resulting in a smaller value of cf cd and a larger value of cp f cp d 3 3 2 solute plume width the influence of ndes on the solute plume width i e wd wf is shown in fig 10 while values of wd and wf are given in supplemental material table s4 b larger domain sizes 2 m 2 m models are used for cases e1 d3 and e3 when θm 30 cases e1 d2 and b3 to d3 when θm 45 and cases c2 d2 and a3 to c3 when θm 60 because the concentration isoline i e the regions where c 10 3 mol m3 used in defining the plume width intercepts the right model boundary in 1 m 1 m size models to avoid mesh dependent errors the grid sizes of the 2 m 2 m models are the same as those of the 1 m 1 m models the concentrations along the pff bottom boundary cb of the 1 m 1 m and 2 m 2 m models are exactly the same which provides the validity of the 2 m 2 m models although the comparative results are not listed here the plume widths of some cases are not included in fig 10 because cp was less than c 0 as shown in table s4 a or the c 0 isoline intercepted the right model boundary even in the 2 m 2 m models thus plume width w as well as wd wf are omitted in these conditions a model domain larger than 2 m 2 m was not utilized in this study positive values of wd wf in fig 10 indicate that for those cases ndes cause fms to have lower w values than dms in scenario 1 the maximum value of wd wf is 0 0143 m suggesting that ndes have only a slight effect on w under these conditions fig 10 shows also that in scenarios 1 and 2 the plume width change due to ndes shows a positive correlation with θm and 2b and a negative correlation with km this is consistent with the general trends shown in fig 8 which presents relationships between these same parameters and qf d qf f the ndes in fms results in lower specific discharge in pff qf compared to dms as shown in fig 7 which led to greater values of w in fms compared to those of dms as evident in fig 10 in scenario 1 and 2 scenario 3 contains both positive and negative values of wd wf positive values in case a3 and b3 reflect the positive correlation with θm and 2b and a negative correlation with km described above for scenario 1 and 2 negative values of wd wf indicate that ndes cause plume narrowing for those cases this arises from the greater attenuation of the solute plume in dms compared to fms resulting in both lower values of cp and narrower plume widths in the dms of these cases see w values of case d3 in table s4 b when θm 30 45 and 60 cp d values of case c3 are 0 00296 mol m3 0 0021 mol m3 and 0 00173 mol m3 respectively as shown in table s4 b because these low values of cp d are only slightly larger than c 0 10 3 mol m3 recalling that c 0 is used to characterize the plume width the upper edge of the c 0 isoline is close to the pff bottom boundary and hence the plume width is smaller in the dm case compared to the fm case for example wd wf values in case c3 are lower than in case b3 overall the impacts of ndes on plume width prediction in larger 2b conditions i e 2b 0 001 m in this study depend on the parameter combination of km 2b and θm in a more complex manner than the simpler trends that are apparent for smaller 2b cases i e 2b 0 001 m furthermore the reduced w in lower km kf cases from case c3 to d3 see table s4 b is not consistent with sebben and werner 2016b who found that the increase in w is greatest in lower km kf cases this is because as km decreased from case c3 to d3 lower cp that is closer to c 0 was obtained see table s4 a consequently leading to smaller w that calculated by the using of c 0 3 3 3 plume symmetry the influences of ndes on the solute plume symmetry are firstly assessed by the difference in symmetry between dms and fms wl f wr f wl d wr d as presented in fig 11 while the values of wl wr for dms and fms i e wl d wr d and wl f wr f are given in table s4 c note that the values of wl wr are always smaller than 1 because the pff is oblique to the flow direction see fig 2 thus a larger value of wl wr demonstrates a more symmetric plume the wl f wr f wl d wr d values of most conditions in fig 11 are greater than 0 suggesting that the plumes of fms are more symmetric than that of the corresponding dms in these conditions negative values of wl f wr f wl d wr d indicating that the dm produced a more symmetric plume than the fm were obtained for case d3 with θm 30 and 45 the value of wl f wr f wl d wr d in case d3 and θm 45 is 0 077 because cp d is slightly larger than c 0 cp d 0 00108 mol m3 which lead to the smaller value of wr as well as larger wl wr for dm compared to fm wr d 0 42 and wr f 1 45 wl d wr d 0 11015 and wl f wr f 0 03309 and not shown in fig 11 as listed in table s4 c the pattern that wl d wr d increases i e more symmetric plume as km decreases from case c3 to case d3 for dms is not consistent with sebben and werner 2016b this arises from the low values of cp d that is close to c 0 in case d3 which results in smaller wr as well as larger value of wl d wr d fig 11 shows that with the exception of case a1 a small value of km leads to reduced ndes on plume symmetry which is contrary to the earlier observation that smaller km produces increased impacts of ndes on the flow field and peak concentration see fig 8 and fig 9 this is explored further in fig 12 which shows values of wl and wr for the various dm and fm cases fig 12 shows that the values of wl wr are mostly dependent on the wr because the variation in wl is small from case a to e and from scenario 1 to 3 fig 12a also shows that in scenarios 1 and 2 narrower wr were found in fms compared to dms as km reduces or 2b increases which indicates an increased effect of ndes on plume symmetry in scenario 3 the impacts of ndes on wr depend on the parameter combination of km and 2b reduced wr from case b3 to d3 arises from the low cp and w values in these conditions see table s4 a and table s4 b 3 3 4 displacement of the peak solute concentration fig 14 shows the effect of the pff on the solute distribution in different locations above the pff at y 0 5005 m 0 505 m and 0 51 m for case a2 i e km 5 10 3 m s 2b 5 10 3 m fig 14 shows similar results to those of sebben and werner 2016a in that solute distributions between pff models dms and fms and the matrix only models mo gradually match at locations close to the solute source as y decreases i e away from the solute source and approaching the pff top boundary the concentration in pff models gradually deviates from the corresponding matrix only models which indicates that the downstream pff can influence solute distributions in the upstream matrix sebben and werner 2016b proved that smaller km kf or larger 2b could lead to more significant bde thus fig 14 only shows the comparison results of case a2 for different θm conditions as an example to evaluate the influence of ndes and θm on bde the impact of ndes on the displacement of the peak solute concentration lh d lh f is illustrated in fig 13 in all conditions of this study values of lh d lh f are greater than 0 indicating that ndes reduce the plume displacement caused by the pff i e ndes lead to plume distributions along the pff bottom boundary that are shifted upstream the ndes on lh are more pronounced in cases characterized by larger 2b i e from scenario 1 to 3 which is consistent with the earlier observations that larger 2b increases the ndes on tanθf as listed in table 4 that is a larger 2b produces stronger ndes on the flow within the pff as seen in section 3 2 resulting in larger deviation between tanθf d and tanθf f and hence higher lh d lh f values furthermore the cases with larger θm lead to greater values of lh d lh f indicating the influence of ndes on lh is amplified by a larger θm on the other hand a larger 2b or θm would not only produce greater ji j but also prolong the transport distance for solute transport through the pff i e the length of solute migration affected by ndes for a given 2b and θm the lh d lh f variations in alternative km conditions are minimal and close to the horizontal grid resolution δl which is close to 2b near the pff thus the results in fig 12 highlight that the main factors controlling ndes on lh are 2b and θm 3 4 quantification of solute distributions above the pff the peak solute concentration ratios between fms and matrix only models cp f cmo at y 0 5005 m i e top boundary of pff are 0 661 0 634 and 0 649 for θm 30 45 and 60 respectively moreover the peak solute concentration ratios between dms and matrix only model cp d cmo are 0 612 0 569 and 0 572 for θm 30 45 and 60 respectively although the model with θm 45 has the strongest bde compared to the other conditions the degrees of bde in different θm conditions are very close thus it appears that θm has minor influence on the bde fig 13 shows that fms always produce closer results to the matrix only model than dms indicating that nde could release the bde furthermore a larger degree of bde distinction between dms and fms produced as θm increased cp f cmo cp d cmo are 0 048 0 065 and 0 078 when θm 30 45 and 60 at y 0 51 m these results are expected since smaller qf for fms compared to dms will result in less dispersion effect in pff which then decreases the movement of solute back to upstream matrix resulting in more concentrated solute plume in both pff and upper matrix as well as lower degree of bde while ndes may reduce the impact of bdes the simulation results show that bdes still have a major impact on the upstream solute distribution in the fm cases studied here 4 discussion the conceptual model and parameters of dms presented in this study are similar to those of sebben and werner 2016a 2016b enabling us to compare the effects of ndes with fms it is important to note that sebben and werner 2016a 2016b did not examine the influence of ndes on flow and solute transport but the re of the flow in the pff was large enough to exhibit ndes to the best of our knowledge this is the first numerical study that considers non darcian flow in a permeable host matrix through the pff where the matrix flow is oblique to the pff orientation these matrix pff conditions are common in real world sedimentary aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity and complex pff networks nonetheless the results of this study highlight the key differences between dms and fms as well as the main factors driving ndes that have not previously been thoroughly investigated the flow field in the matrix and fluid conservation at the matrix pff interface i e eq 12 specify the pff basic discharge and direction for the conceptual models in this analysis the mass conservation flux at matrix pff interfaces of both dm and fm is depicted in fig 15 for illustration purposes the fluid flux passing through the pff matrix interface in fig 15 can be obtained as 15a q nm ab q m cos θ m 15b q nf ab q f cos θ f note that eq 15 represents fluid fluxes through a unit thickness of the 2d model due to mass conservation in eq 12 the relationship of the flow field between the matrix and pff in eq 15 can be described as 16 q m cos θ m q f cos θ f eq 16 indicates an inverse relationship between the qf and θf when the flow field in the matrix left hand side of eq 16 is the subject as shown in fig 15 considering ndes in the pff result in smaller qf and leads to a smaller θf for fms i e θf f compared to dms i e θf d to produce a greater cross section for fms bd f compared to dms b d d to achieve mass conservation for dms according to eq 11 and eq 16 qf can be easily obtained as 17 q f q m cos θ m 1 tan θ m k f k m 2 eq 17 indicates that a smaller km kf i e smaller km or larger 2b and a larger θm increase qf and as a consequence a larger qf leads to stronger ndes on the pff flow producing greater qf and θf distinctions of fms and dms as shown in fig 8 and table 4 the solute distributions difference between dms and fms can be analyzed by contrasting the ndes impact on the pff flow field that is 1 a larger 2b results in a smaller km kf as well as an increased ratio of viscous dissipation to the total hydraulic gradient ji j that represent the magnitude of ndes larger 2b also leads to longer travel distance for the solute to transport through the pff which could amplify the influence of ndes on solute distribution 2 a smaller km leads to a smaller km kf resulting in a larger ji j as well as stronger ndes and 3 larger θm produces increased θf which can extend the solute transport distance in the pff and then amplify the ndes all of the above parameter variations will increase the ndes on solute distribution in small 2b conditions i e scenario 1 and 2 in current study however in large 2b conditions i e 2b 0 001 m the impact of ndes on solute plume width and symmetry is dependent on the parameter combination of km 2b and θm because the cp of these conditions is close to c 0 the influences of dispersivity and ndes in the pff on plume distributions were evaluated by modifying the matrix and pff longitudinal and transverse dispersivities αlm αlf αtm and αtf respectively for dms in cases a2 to c2 with θm 45 dispersivities were increased to αlm αlf 0 01 m and αtm αtf 0 001 m twice the default values and decreased to αlm αlf 0 0025 m and αtm αtf 0 00025 m half the default values comparison of concentrations along the pff bottom boundary cb between dms with modified dispersivities and fms with default dispersivities are shown in fig s5 fig s5 illustrates that decreasing dispersivity produces more concentrated plume distributions as expected characterized by narrower plume widths and higher peak concentrations this is similar to the influence of ndes see fig 9 and fig 10 which also reduce plume dispersiveness in case a2 fig s5 a the impact of considering ndes was weaker than that of reducing the dispersivities with the higher km in cases b2 and c2 the influence of ndes exceeds that of reducing dispersivities further investigation is required to evaluate the combined controls of ndes and dispersivity on plume distributions in matrix pff systems the ndes on plume distribution above the pff are highlighted by comparing concentrations above the pff between matrix only model fm and dm less pronounced bdes were found in cases that considered non darcian flow in pff compared to others that did not these conclusions can be briefly explained by the flow field distinction which is a smaller specific discharge in the pff of fms producing less of a dispersion effect than dms furthermore the concentration gradient in the matrix pff interfaces decreased the movement of solute from pff to the upper matrix the results above support sebben and werner s 2016b conclusion that the degree of the bde is likely linked to the pe of the pff furthermore when compared to other variables the evaluated bde under various θm conditions shows that θm has a minor effect since the causes of bde are unknown in current studies defining factors that lead to bde were not assessed in this research this is also an area of study that needs to be addressed in future studies to further investigate the impacts of ndes in different matrix pff systems the influence of ndes on the solute distribution was evaluated where the pff is assumed to be filled with materials following the assumption of sebben and werner 2016b identical boundary conditions and parameter settings to those of sebben and werner 2016b were used in the models but with non darcian forchheimer flow within the pff as in eq 7 and eq 9 the results show that the filled pff conditions produce dm and fm outputs that are identical in terms of the flow field discharge and direction solute distribution and plume characteristics indicating that ndes have little effect in filled pff conditions this is a consequence of the small inertial force relative to the viscous force under these conditions ndes were subsequently evaluated using hydraulic gradients in the matrix that were 10 and 100 times i e hydraulic gradients of 1 414 and 14 14 within the matrix respectively greater than those in sebben and werner s models 2016b the results show that significant ndes arose only when the hydraulic gradient within the matrix was 14 14 which is extremely high and nearly impossible to achieve under natural conditions as a result when the pff is filled with porous material ndes in pffs are likely to be negligible in matrix pff systems 5 conclusions the impact of ndes in a single pff on the solute distribution of a permeable aquifer was investigated in this study the forchheimer equation was used to describe non darcian flow within the pff the results of non darcian models flow fields and solute plume distributions were analyzed and compared to those of darcian models in addition sensitivity analysis was performed by modifying the matrix hydraulic conductivity matrix pff aperture and flow direction in the matrix to examine their contribution to ndes impacts the numerical models developed in this study as well as their outputs help us better understand how solute plumes are distributed in complex real world fractured aquifers several conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the specific discharge qf and angle of flow refraction θf in the pff for non darcian models are often smaller than darcian models differences in flow fields caused by ndes are enhanced by smaller km values and larger 2b or θm values 2 non darcian models tend to produce a weaker attenuation effect on the peak concentration of the solute plume relative to darcian models which results in a greater peak solute concentration the impacts of ndes on peak solute concentration increases with smaller km values and larger 2b or θm values 3 when 2b is smaller 2b 0 001 m non darcian models produce narrower plume widths and more symmetric plumes than darcian models a larger difference in the plume i e due to ndes is observed when 2b or θm is larger or when km is smaller as 2b increases 2b 0 001 m the impacts of ndes on plume width and symmetry are determined by the parameter combination of km 2b and θm 4 displacement in the peak solute concentration lh of non darcian models is smaller than that of darcian models the ndes on lh are more pronounced in cases with larger 2b and θm but are minor influenced only slightly by km 5 in cases where km is smaller or 2b is larger back dispersion has a greater impact on solute distribution while θm has only a minor influence back dispersion effects could be reduced by ndes particularly in cases with larger θm the influence of ndes on solute distributions described above can be used to guide the analysis of field and laboratory experiments of pffs embedded within porous media for example if the solute plume observed in experiments is more concentrated or shifted upstream than the simulation result of using the darcian flow assumption for the pffs one can consider ndes in pff flow as a possible cause for the discrepancy in our numerical models 2b 0 0005 m is a key value for the emergence of ndes in pffs indicating that researchers should pay attention to ndes when the aperture of the pff is close to or exceeds 0 0005 m the current study builds on the previous findings of sebben and werner 2016a 2016b as the first step to exploring the role of ndes in pffs embedded within permeable aquifers a range of idealized pff aquifer conditions were considered bounded by typical parameters from real world conditions however due to the limited number of scenarios and idealized conceptualizations of the model other factors relevant to the influence of ndes s such as dispersivity variability in the pff geometry pff networks solute adsorption and precipitation and geomechanical considerations were not evaluated in the current study these factors are likely to modify the importance of ndes on solute transport in pff aquifer systems and thus further research is recommended to study how natural variability might control the influence of ndes on solute transport in real world settings declaration of

3825,fractures faults karstic features and or interbedded layers of coarse sediment often manifest in the form of preferential flow features pffs previous investigations into the effects of pffs on solute plume distributions within otherwise permeable host rocks have treated flow in pffs as darcian however flow through faults and fractures is known to exhibit non darcian flow behavior the current study extends previous investigations of the effects of pffs e g a fault or fracture on solute plumes in permeable aquifers that assume darcian flow in the fault fracture the finite element model comsol multiphysics was applied to examine how non darcian flow in a single pff influences flow fields and steady state solute plume distributions in permeable aquifers compared with the darcian flow assumption the forchheimer equation was applied within numerical models to represent flow in the pff for a variety of pff permeability contrasts pff apertures and matrix flow directions the refraction of flow lines at matrix pff interfaces and the specific discharge in the pff were found to be smaller in non darcian models leading to larger peak solute concentrations by up to 160 and narrower plumes compared to darcian models in addition the impact of non darcian flow on flow fields and solute plumes was greater with smaller matrix hydraulic conductivity larger pff aperture and larger incidence angle at the matrix pff interface upstream dispersion at the matrix pff interface observed in previous matrix pff studies of solute transport as the result of steep solute concentration gradients opposing head gradients was found to be reduced when non darcian flow was considered in pffs this study highlights that non darcian flow effects may be significant in the

effect pff preferential flow feature 1 introduction naturally occurring porous media commonly contain heterogeneities in the form of thin layers of higher permeability relative to the host matrix manifested as fractures faults karstic features and or interbedded layers of coarse sediments bear et al 1993 berkowitz 2002 collectively referred to herein as preferential flow features pffs these lead to modifications to flow and solute transport that are often represented by anisotropy in aquifer hydraulic properties when the investigation scale is significantly large however the hydraulic conductivity of a pff kf m s and that of the host matrix km m s may differ by orders of magnitude leading to flow fields that are not adequately reproduced by homogenized anisotropic models thereby inhibiting their ability to correctly simulate solute transport behavior long et al 1982 kessler and hunt 1994 vujević et al 2014 sebben et al 2015 the effects of pffs have been recognized and

geochemical and isotopic indicators to assess seawater intrusion within a fractured aquifer system pffs appeared to contribute significantly to the pattern of salinization within seepage waters

himmelsbach 2002 roels et al 2003 sharma and dixit 2014 for example sonnenborg et al 1999 created pffs by juxtaposing manufactured permeable blocks to investigate flow and solute transport in fractured media discrete fracture network dfn models were used to simulate experimental breakthrough curves compared with the models that used mean apertures for the pff the models with spatial variations in pff apertures were found to better describe the experimental observations and mass exchange between pffs and the rock matrix wendland and himmelsbach 2002 investigated solute migration in a fractured sedimentary rock using pyranine as a tracer based on the experiment analyses and corresponding numerical simulations they found that matrix diffusion played a non negligible role in solute migration acting to retard solute transport within the pff previous field and laboratory studies indicate that a proper understanding of the role of pffs in controlling flow and solute transport in porous media is an important requirement for improving the characterization of contaminant transport in highly heterogeneous settings odling and roden 1997 sebben and werner 2016b while

et al 2014 however where pffs are embedded into otherwise permeable aquifers solute transport within and between the matrix and the pff is expected to occur through advection mechanical dispersion and molecular diffusion birkhölzer et al 1993b thus consideration of these transport processes is necessary in studying pffs embedded in otherwise permeable materials several previous studies have examined flow and solute transport in aquifers comprising permeable matrixes and pff networks using primarily numerical and analytical modelling techniques rubin and buddemeier 1996 compared the flow and solute distributions from an epm model with those from a dfn model for a permeable matrix embedded with two sets of oblique and parallel fractures they found that some epm models needed the transverse dispersivity αt m to be larger than the longitudinal dispersivity αl m to reasonably represent the solute distributions obtained from the dfn models odling and roden 1997 included naturally occurring pff geometries in their investigation of flow and solute transport in fractured porous matrixes thereby considering a wider range of pff networks than previously considered they found that fracture connectivity was as important as the pff orientation and spacing in controlling the transport of contaminant plumes willmann et al 2013 developed a particle tracking method to examine pffs embedded within a permeable matrix where advection and diffusion were considered in both the pffs and the surrounding matrix mass exchange at the pff matrix interface was dependent on the fracture aperture the flux perpendicular to the interface and diffusion ronayne 2013 examined solute transport in three dimensional synthetic karst systems with branching pff networks and a permeable matrix using numerical modeling it was shown that a more convoluted fracture network can enhance conduit matrix mixing resulting in a wider variation of solute arrival times studies analyzing pff matrix behavior at the scale of an individual pff arose from the need to better understand the processes through which pffs modify contaminant plumes in permeable matrixes this is particularly important where the flow direction within the host matrix is oblique to the pff orientation for example houseworth et al 2013 obtained a closed form analytical solution for steady state two dimensional 2d flow and solute transport in a permeable matrix containing a single pff flow in the matrix was presumed to be oblique to the pff orientation but sufficiently slow to neglect mechanical dispersion in the matrix sebben and werner 2016a used 2d numerical modeling to add to the analysis of houseworth et al 2013 by considering mechanical dispersion in the matrix in otherwise comparable conceptual models they analyzed the influence of a single pff on steady state solute distributions in rock matrixes of moderate to high hydraulic conductivity km of 10 6 to 5 10 3 m s e g sandstone and limestone containing pffs apertures of 0 25 10 3 to 0 5 10 3 m assumed to be open fully mixed and oblique to the flow direction in the matrix the solute plume originated from a point source upstream of the pff sebben and werner 2016a found that the influence of the pff on solute plume distributions is mainly determined by the host rock to pff hydraulic conductivity ratio km kf and by the distance from the solute source to the pff diluted and more asymmetric solute plumes were obtained from lower values of km kf sebben and werner 2016b built on the pff study of sebben and werner 2016a by evaluating the effects of barrier flow features i e bffs which are less permeable than the host matrix and the parameters 2b aperture of pffs or bffs m and kf on solute plumes in otherwise similar conditions to those assessed by sebben and werner 2016a bffs were presumed to arise due to lithology changes such as clay layers embedded in sand sandstone aquifers or from in filling of fractures with low permeability materials in fractured rock settings they adopted km of 10 5 m s and kf of 10 7 to 10 3 m s apertures of 2 5 10 4 to 0 02 m and included a simple analytical expression for the orthogonal displacement of flow lines caused by either pffs or bffs their investigation of bffs found that bffs produced weaker and contrasting influences on solute displacement and plume symmetry compared to pffs for example whereas pffs reduce the peak solute concentration and lead to downstream displacement of solute plumes bffs lead to higher peak solute concentrations relative to the situation of no pff and upstream displacement of solute plumes beneath bffs sebben and werner 2016b also found that larger values of 2b lead to lower peak solute concentrations and wider more asymmetric solute plumes in cases involving pffs while bff simulations also produced wider plumes with increased 2b but plume asymmetry was not influenced significantly by 2b robinson and werner 2017 presented an analytical solution for the passage of a solute plume through a permeable aquifer containing a single fault or facture whereby the mechanical dispersion was taken into consideration both in the host matrix and the pff or bff thereby building on the solution of houseworth et al 2013 who neglected mechanical dispersion in their solution robinson and werner s 2017 solution overcomes the grid resolution and scale issues encountered by sebben and werner 2016a 2016b and thereby allows for effectively infinite domain sizes to be considered without the computational constraints of numerical approaches the aforementioned studies represented pffs using darcy s law e g houseworth et al 2013 sebben and werner 2016a sebben and werner 2016b robinson and werner 2017 however flow in a single pff open channel or filled with porous material may become non darcian whereby the flow is no longer linearly proportional to the hydraulic gradient kohl et al 1997 wen et al 2006 qian et al 2015 non darcian flow arises when inertial effects are non negligible basak 1976 soni et al 1978 dudgeon 1985 zimmerman et al 2004 and has been observed in both laminar and turbulent flow regimes şen 1987 qian et al 2005 wen et al 2014 the transition between laminar and turbulent flow regimes is linked to the reynolds number re given by bear et al 1993 1 re 2bq v where q m s is the specific discharge and v m2 s is the kinematic viscosity the fracture aperture 2b is taken as the characteristic length for assessing flow conditions within pffs qian et al 2015 used laboratory experiments to evaluate the transition from darcian to non darcian flow in an artificial single fracture where the fracture was filled by coarse sand the forchheimer equation was used to fit the experimental data and inertial and viscous terms were compared to evaluate the magnitude of non darcian flow behavior the authors observed non darcian flow when re approached or exceeded 3 zimmerman et al 2004 observed non darcian flow in replicas of natural fractures unfilled at re values of 1 although many experimental and numerical studies have examined the criterion for non darcian flow in porous media and obtained corresponding expressions and values for specific subsurface properties at which transition may occur chilton and colburn 1931 green and duwez 1951 ma and ruth 1993 qian et al 2015 there is not general criteria for the occurrence of non darcian flow in porous media and rather published thresholds for the transition from darcian to non darcian flow in porous media are inconsistent zeng and grigg 2006 previous studies of permeable aquifers containing pffs have not attempted to evaluate the degree to which non darcian flow may influence flow fields and solute plume distributions despite that non darcian flow in the pff is likely to occur under natural conditions yang et al 2018 thus it is currently unclear as to whether the treatment of flow within pffs as darcian flow will lead to significant deviation in terms of predicting the flow field and solute distributions for situations in which non darcian flow occurs within pffs in reality in the pff analysis of sebben and werner 2016b an anomalous upstream dispersion effect termed back dispersion effect bde by the authors was observed whereby solutes moved against the groundwater flow direction in the host rock on the upstream side of the pff the bde was attributed to steep concentration gradients and macroscopic dispersion parameters leading to artificially intensified solute movement localized to the upstream side of the pff bdes have been recognized in other studies of solute transport including in homogeneous media al niami and rushton 1977 marino 1978 kumar 1983 konikow 2011 irvine et al 2021 liu et al 2004 also encountered a bde in solute transport models involving three dimensional heterogeneous systems characterized by a dendritic network of pffs both liu et al 2004 and sebben and werner 2016b found that larger values of km kf resulted in less pronounced bdes in the matrix upstream of pffs this study aims to investigate non darcian flow in pffs embedded within permeable host rocks and its effect on flow fields and solute plume distributions within both the pff and host rocks in this way the current investigation extends the works of houseworth et al 2013 sebben and werner 2016a 2016b and robinson and werner 2017 who adopted darcian flow in the pff in their analyses of steady state solute plume distributions originating from within the host rock and subsequently intercepting the pff a key factor under consideration is the extent of the anomalous bde observed in previous studies that presume darcian flow in the pff 2 methodology 2 1 conceptual model and experimental procedure the conceptual model adopted in this study follows that of sebben and werner 2016a i e a 2d domain i e horizontal planar of size 1 m 1 m as shown in fig 1 a single horizontal open channel pff was placed in the middle of the domain i e the lower face of the pff is located at y 0 5 m the boundary conditions along all four sides are specified heads that are linear functions of distance as indicated in fig 1 that is h 1 h 2 h 3 and h 4 refer to the hydraulic heads at the four vertices through which the angle of incidence at the matrix pff interface θm and the hydraulic gradient in the matrix can be modulated the head drop from h 1 to h 2 equals the head drop from h 4 to h 3 and the head drop from h 1 to h 4 equals the head drop from h 2 to h 3 a solute source with continuous flux fm mol m s is added at location x y 0 1 m 0 55 2b m that is the distance from the solute source to the upper face of the pff is 0 05 m for different 2b conditions similar to the value of 0 048 m that was used by sebben and werner 2016b sensitivity analysis was used to assess the influence of non darcian effects ndes on flow fields and steady state solute plume distributions this was achieved by comparing the results of darcian models dms within which pff flow was assumed to be darcian and non darcian models fms within which flow in the pff was assumed to be non darcian as represented by the forchheimer equation sensitivity analysis simulations adopted various values for km 2b and θm the values of parameters used within sensitivity analysis simulation cases are listed in table 1 the same km values as those adopted by sebben and werner 2016a were adopted in the current study as cases a to e with the exception of their lowest value of km 10 6 m s for which we were unable to obtain reliable results due to numerical instabilities km values ranging from 10 5 m s to 10 3 m s are typical of unfractured un karstified limestone geiger et al 2010 webb et al 2010 preliminary simulations showed that both reducing dispersivity and considering ndes rather than assuming darcian flow lead to narrower plume widths thus the values for dispersivity used by sebben and werner 2016a were adopted in the current study additional sensitivity analysis of dispersivity was conducted for three simulation cases to compare the plume distribution variations caused by changing dispersivity and taking ndes into account in the pff results are briefly shown in the discussion section values for the solute flux fm were also the same as those used by sebben and werner 2016a as listed in table 1 such that the maximum solute concentration at the source location is approximately 1 mol m3 in each model this allows concentrations to be considered as a fraction of the maximum concentration i e 0 1 mol m3 is 10 of the maximum source solute concentration for each of the cases given in table 1 three scenarios were created and assessed using values for 2b of 2 5 10 4 m scenario 1 5 10 4 m scenario 2 and 1 10 3 m scenario 3 thus the simulation cases and scenarios were labelled as a1 a2 a3 b1 e2 e3 where the letter a to e indicates the km case and the number 1 to 3 refers to the pff aperture 2b scenario as shown in table 2 e g scenario c2 has km 5 10 4 m s and 2b 5 10 4 m the value of 2b 5 10 4 m used for scenario 2 is the same as the 2b value used by sebben and werner 2016a the range of 2b values represents medium sized fractures e g 10 4 m to 10 3 m birkhölzer et al 1993a sonnenborg et al 1999 geiger et al 2010 for each case and scenario three flow directions within the matrix θm equal to 30 45 and 60 were also tested these parameter combinations led to 45 simulations for each dm and fm furthermore five matrix only models mo in which the pff is filled with identical material to the matrix i e the pff is absent with km values that are the same as cases a to e were run to assist in assessing the influence of the bde in previous studies that treat open channel pffs as porous media e g birkhölzer et al 1993a willmann et al 2013 sebben and werner 2016a the pff kf value adopted in darcian models is calculated by the cubic law expressed as 2 k f 2 b 2 ρ g 12 μ where g m s2 is the acceleration of gravity ρ kg m3 is fluid density and μ kg m s is dynamic viscosity the values of 2b used in the current study lead to kf 0 051 m s 0 204 m s and 0 817 m s for scenarios 1 to 3 respectively sebben and werner 2016a found km kf to be the main factor controlling the solute distribution based on analyses of km kf values ranging from 4 9 10 6 to 2 5 10 2 the various combinations of km and 2b in the current study produce km kf ratios that vary between 1 2 10 5 and 9 8 10 2 as given in table 2 the specific discharge in the matrix qm m s adopted by sebben and werner 2016a 2016b was also used in the current study leading to a hydraulic gradient equal to 0 1414 thus the boundary conditions when θm 30 are 3a h 1 2 0 2 0 05 2 x 3b h 2 3 0 2 0 05 2 0 05 6 y 1 3c h 3 4 0 2 0 05 6 0 05 2 x 3d h 4 1 0 2 0 05 6 y 1 where h 1 2 h 2 3 h 3 4 h 4 1 m indicate hydraulic head distributions along the top right bottom and left boundaries of the domain fig 1 respectively when θm 45 4a h 1 2 0 2 0 1 4b h 2 3 0 1 y 4c h 3 4 0 1 0 1 x 4d h 4 1 0 1 0 1 y when θm 60 5a h 1 2 0 2 0 05 6 x 5b h 2 3 0 2 0 05 6 0 05 2 y 1 5c h 3 4 0 2 0 05 2 0 05 6 x 5d h 4 1 0 2 0 05 2 y 1 the impact of ndes on solute distributions was firstly assessed by examining the 2 d plume distribution difference between each fm and the corresponding dm i e cf cd where c refers to the solute concentration distribution and superscripts f and d indicate non darcian and darcian results respectively plume characteristics were evaluated using similar metrics to those adopted by sebben and werner 2016b as shown in fig 2 which provides the results of the darcian model applied to case b2 km 5 10 3 m s 2b 5 10 4 m with θm 45 for illustrative purpose the change in plume charateristics caused by ndes were analyzed by evaluating 1 the ratio of the fm peak concentration beneath the pff to the corresponding dm value i e cp f cp d here cp is the maximum concentration along the pff bottom boundary shown as the red cross in fig 2 2 differences between dm and fm solute plume widths i e wd wf where w is the solute plume width at y 0 5 m i e along the pff bottom boundary designated by concentrations equal to c 0 10 3 mol m3 see fig 2 and superscipts d and f are as previously 3 differences in plume symmetry wl wr between fms and dms i e wl f wr f wl d wr d where wl is the distance between the locations of c 0 and cp to the left upstream side of c 0 and wr is that on the right downstream side of c 0 as depicted in fig 2 4 the displacement lh of the peak solute concentration representing the distance between the x location of cp and that of cmo i e the peak concentration from a matrix only model as shown in fig 3 the peak concentration displacement between a dm and an fm is determined as lh d lh f where superscipts d and f are as previously upstream dispersion bde was also evaluated by quantifying differences in solute plume distributions between pff models dms and fms and the matrix only model mo in the matrix above i e upstream of the pff 2 2 governing equations for flow and transport and numerical implementation in solving flow and transport within the pff and matrix only conceptual models described above groundwater flow was solved first and solute transport was subsequently resolved using flow velocities as input flow in the matrix was governed by darcy s law whereas pff flow was treated as either darcian or non darcian flow for dms and fms respectively 2d darcy s law can be written in terms of the head gradient as 6 h q k where is the laplace operator h m is hydraulic head k m s is isotropic hydraulic conductivity and q m s is the two dimensional specific discharge the forchheimer equation is used for non darcian flow in the pff which can be expressed as forchheimer 1901 7 h q k β f g q q where βf 1 m is the non darcian coefficient the forchheimer equation has shown good agreement to relationships between the hydraulic gradient and flow velocity observed in laboratory experiments in pffs containing non darcian flow e g qian et al 2015 in applications of the forchheimer equation to open channel pff flow choi et al 1997 set βf to 10g for 2b values between 0 5 mm and 1 mm whereas moutsopoulos 2009 adopted βf values of 16 with 2b 4 mm as obtained by the expression for fully turbulent flow in rough open channel fractures kohl et al 1997 8 β f 1 2 b 15 295 if pff is presumed to contain porous medium βf can be calculated by the commonly used ergun equation li and engler 2001 9 β f a c 0 5 k 0 5 n 1 5 where k m2 is the permeability of the pff n is the porosity of the pff and dimensionless constants have the commonly used values a 1 74 and c 150 takhanov 2011 no widely accepted expression for βf that depends on fracture hydraulic characteristics has been obtained for non darcian laminar flow in unfilled open channel pffs compared to eq 8 eq 9 is more widely used for the non darcian coefficient and is considered a reasonable estimate for the conceptual model of the current study thus eq 9 is applied to both unfilled and filled pffs in the current analysis of non darcian flow whereby porosity values are adopted that reflect porous media i e n 1 or an open channel i e n 1 note that the permeability recognizing that k kρg μ in eq 9 was obtained by the cubic law eq 2 the first and second terms on the right hand side of eq 7 represent components of flow related to viscous forces jv and inertial forces ji respectively that is jv q k and ji β f g q 2 allowing eq 7 to be written as 10 j jv ji where j h is the hydraulic gradient in the direction of flow within the pff the value of ji j indicates the portion of the hydraulic gradient that is dissipated by inertial forces which is presumed here to also represent the ndes on pff flow the magnitude of non darcian effects can be analyzed by evaluating ji j for example when ji j is greater than 0 1 both inertial force and viscous force should be considered thereby requiring consideration of non darcian flow zeng and grigg 2006 when the flows in both the matrix and the pff are darcian hubbert 1940 found that the water flow direction will be refracted at the interface between different porous media the classical law of flow line refraction rumer and shiau 1968 can be described as 11 k m k f tan θ m tan θ f continuity requires that the mass flux on either side of the matrix pff interfaces must be equal leading to continuity of flux normal to the pff orientation additionally the pressure at the matrix pff interface must match both domains thus we used equivalent normal specific discharge and pressure to couple the two domains matrix and pff at the two matrix pff interfaces i e the upper and lower faces of the pff this can be expressed as 12a q nm q nf 12b p m p f 12c q nm q nf where qn m3 s is the fluid flux passing through the pff matrix interface and p pa and qn m s are pressure and normal specific discharge at the pff matrix interface respectively the subscripts m and f refer to the matrix and pff respectively the transport of conservative solute is described by the advection dispersion equation given by 13 c t d c v c where c mol m3 is the solute concentration v m s is the two dimensional flow velocity and recognizing that n v q d dij m2 s is the dispersion tensor which is defined as bear 1972 14 d ij α t v δ ij α l α t v i v j v where δij is the kronecker delta fuction this leads to longitudinal and transverse dispersion coefficients dl and dt m2 s equal to αlv in the flow direction and αtv in the direction perpendicular to flow respectively the model proposed in this study was simulated using the finite element numerical code comsol multiphysics comsol 2008 which allows for flexibility in the choice of governing equations the equations were solved using the direct solver mumps with default solver values the concentrations of all simulations were evaluated at 90 days similar to sebben and werner 2016a 2016b this proved to be a sufficient length of time for the flow to reach steady state conditions as determined by stable concentrations at model nodes adaptive time stepping in comsol multiphysics was used whereby the initial and maximum time steps were 0 0407 s and 360 s respectively the accuracy of the numerical implementation of the relevant equations within comsol multiphysics was checked using nine cases which were simulated to compare comsol multiphysics s outputs with a numerical modeling by sebben and werner 2016b and b the analytical solution of robinson and werner 2017 detailed model settings and comparison results are provided in the supplemental material which demonstrates that the numerical solution applied in this study is sufficiently accurate in simulating the matrix pff conceptual model at least where the pff is treated as porous medium the re in pffs in the current study ranges from 0 8845 non darcian model with 2b 2 5 10 4 m and θm 30 to 100 1 darcian model with 2b 10 3 m and θm 60 the most widely used re criterion to categorize flow regimes is that of freeze and cherry 1979 who suggest that 1 darcian laminar flow occurs when re 1 2 non darcian laminar flow occurs when 1 re 100 and 3 non darcian turbulent flow occurs when re 100 the same re criterion was adopted by menichino and hester 2014 and is also used here the model domain was discretized into variable sized triangular elements in which the nodal spacing δl m ranged from 2 10 4 m minimum at the solute source to 2 10 3 m at maximum distance from the source grid refinement was imposed near the solute source and the pff to enhance the accuracy of numerical simulation this led to a grid of 380 036 nodes and 758 002 elements for scenario 1 2b 2 5 10 4 m 357 113 nodes and 712 178 elements for scenario 2 2b 5 10 4 m and 347 853 nodes and 693 646 elements for scenario 3 2b 10 3 m the longitudinal and transverse grid péclet numbers are given by pe δl αl and pe δl αt respectively zheng and bennett 2002 pe ranges from 0 04 based on the longitudinal dispersivity near the solute source to 4 based on the transverse dispersivity away from the solute source the upper limit of 4 for pe is widely considered as the limit to avoid numerical oscillation and instabilities voss 1984 zheng and bennett 2002 in order to test the reliability of the model calculations and the domain discretization the mesh resolution of case c2 km 5 10 4 m s 2b 5 10 4 m with θm 45 was decreased to 232 986 nodes and 464 324 elements and increased to 623 233 nodes and 1 243 784 elements to observe changes in the results while other parameters were the same as values given in table 1 it was found that the finer and coarser grids produced peak solute concentration beneath the pff that varied within 0 02 and therefore the discretization adopted herein was considered reasonable 3 results 3 1 qualitative evaluation of non darcian effects on solute distributions fig 4 shows solute distributions for dms and fms when θm 45 for cases b1 b2 and b3 the results indicate that ndes have a minor impact on solute distributions although as 2b increases fms produce more concentrated plumes compared to dms to provide a clearer depiction of the differences between dms and fms i e attributed to ndes solute differences between fms and dms i e cf cd are illustrated in fig 5 which shows the results of 15 simulation pairs fms and dms corresponding results are given in supplemental material fig s2 a and fig s2 b for flow directions θm 30 and θm 60 respectively fig 5 shows that the solute concentrations downstream of the source are influenced by ndes resulting in both positive warm colors and negative cool colors differences in solute concentration whereby positive values of cf cd indicate that dms under estimate solute concentrations that would otherwise occur if flow in the pff is non darcian fig 5 also shows that ndes are influenced by km and 2b for example increasing 2b or reducing km leads to wider regions where ndes are apparent in solute concentrations i e cf cd 0 this is a consequence of wider plumes with smaller km kf or larger 2b consistent with observations by sebben and werner 2016a 2016b widening of the region where cf cd 0 occurs as a shift to the right downstream within the pff with the left boundary of this region remaining approximately in the same location in cases a2 to e2 and a3 to e3 reductions in km i e from top to bottom lead to smaller solute concentrations such that values of cf cd approach zero in cases e1 to e3 as shown in fig 5 the results of cf cd for flow directions θm 30 and θm 60 see supplemental material s2 fig s2 a and fig s2 b respectively show similar general patterns to those presented for θm 45 the range of cf cd is of the same order of magnitude for different θm and therefore θm seems to play only a minor role compared to km and 2b in the maximum and minimum values of cf cd however distributions of cf cd were significantly altered by changes to θm evidenced by differences in regions where ndes are apparent in solute concentrations i e cf cd 0 for alternative θm values i e fig 5 s2 1 and s2 b fig 6 compares solute concentrations along the pff bottom boundary cb between dms and fms for 45 simulation pairs the results indicate that ndes have a minor impact on cb in case a1 as 2b increased from scenario 1 to scenario 3 left to right subplots fig 6 or km reduced from case a to case e top to bottom subplots fig 6 ndes became increasingly significant which lead to greater values of cb for fms compared to dms in the main plume area reflected by the positive values in fig 5 despite that values of cf cd approach zero in case e1 to e3 fig 5 fig 6 indicates that ndes still have a non negligible influence on the solute distribution in these smaller km cases 3 2 non darcian effects on flow within the pff table 3 shows re values associated with pff flow in the dms and fms of the current study specific discharge in the pffs of dms qf d and fms qf f is listed table s3 in supplemental material for the 45 simulation pairs it shows that qf is almost insensitive to km and rather depends principally on kf i e 2b and θm i e boundary conditions thus re is given for the different scenarios and θm in table 3 neglecting alternative values of km although the minimum value of re for dms is 0 9056 i e less than the cutoff of re 1 for laminar darcian flow we presume that all cases may potentially lead to non darcian flow within the pff fig 7 illustrates ndes on pff flow as the ratio of the inertial term to the total hydraulic gradient ji j for fms recalling that inertial forces are represented in the pffs of fms but not in dms values of ji j for scenario 1 2b 2 5 10 4 m are less than 0 06 indicating that viscous forces are dominant under these conditions this is consistent with the corresponding values of re 0 9056 to 1 475 table 3 for scenario 1 in scenarios 2 and 3 ji j was found to be 0 193 0 242 and 0 272 scenario 2 and 0 528 0 583 and 0 614 scenario 3 for θm 30 45 60 respectively as ji j is greater than 0 1 both inertial and viscous forces play a significant role in pff flow in these situations this increased role of inertial forces in scenarios 2 and 3 is reflected by higher values of re i e re 5 826 for those cases as given in table 3 fig 8 shows the specific discharge ratio qf d qf f i e dms versus fms for flow in the pff under different scenarios and with varying θm the values of qf d qf f are larger than 1 indicating that ndes can lead to a smaller qf for fms compared to the corresponding dm the values of qf d qf f are less than 1 061 when 2b 2 5 10 4 m scenario 1 indicating limited ndes for scenario 2 2b 5 10 4 m qf d qf f increases from 1 24 θm 30 to 1 38 θm 60 and increases from 2 12 θm 30 to 2 59 θm 60 for scenario 3 2b 1 10 3 m highlighting the non negligible influence of θm on ndes particularly when 2b is relatively large 2b 5 10 4 m fig 8 also demonstrates that ndes have a greater impact on qf with increasing 2b or θm the results above occur because a portion of the hydraulic gradient is dissipated by the inertial force i e ji j in fig 7 in the pff flow of fms which leads to smaller specific discharge within the pffs of fms compared to dms qf d qf f 1 meanwhile the increased portion of hydraulic dissipation in smaller km from case a to c or larger 2b from scenario 1 to 3 conditions is reflected by the larger value of qf d qf f as shown in fig 8 the influence of ndes on the flow direction within pffs is analyzed by comparing the values of tanθf between dms and fms as presented in table 4 for dms the values of tanθf are equal to the corresponding kf km tanθm that is the flow line refraction across the matrix pff interfaces obeys eq 11 for fms values of tanθf are all smaller than those of dms and therefore the refraction law of eq 11 no longer applies furthermore greater tanθf differences between dms and fms are found with increasing 2b or θm 3 3 quantitative evaluation of non darcian effects on solute plume characteristics 3 3 1 peak solute concentration fig 9 shows the peak concentration ratios between fms and dms cp f cp d at the pff bottom boundary of 45 simulation pairs while corresponding values of cp f and cp d are given in supplemental material table s4 a the values of cp f cp d are greater than 1 in fig 9 which indicates that fms produced larger peak solute concentrations than dms the values of cp f cp d are less than 1 06 in scenario 1 indicating limited impact of ndes on cp as 2b increase the values of cp f cp d are larger than 1 08 and 1 72 in scenarios 2 and 3 respectively results in fig 9 also demonstrate that cases characterized by smaller km or larger θm exhibit greater ndes on cp the increased importance of ndes on cp in larger 2b and θm or smaller km conditions is consistent with the effect of these parameters on ji j fig 7 the results above can be explained by the smaller qf within the pff of fms which causes a weaker dispersive effect than corresponding dms resulting in a more concentrated plume in fms with a larger cp furthermore stronger ndes on qf larger 2b and θm or smaller km as shown in fig 8 result in a higher cp f cp d value fig 5 shows that as km decreased from case a to case e smaller values of cf cd were observed but fig 9 shows that cp f cp d increased this is because as km reduced from case a to case e both lower plume concentrations and a stronger nde impact were produced resulting in a smaller value of cf cd and a larger value of cp f cp d 3 3 2 solute plume width the influence of ndes on the solute plume width i e wd wf is shown in fig 10 while values of wd and wf are given in supplemental material table s4 b larger domain sizes 2 m 2 m models are used for cases e1 d3 and e3 when θm 30 cases e1 d2 and b3 to d3 when θm 45 and cases c2 d2 and a3 to c3 when θm 60 because the concentration isoline i e the regions where c 10 3 mol m3 used in defining the plume width intercepts the right model boundary in 1 m 1 m size models to avoid mesh dependent errors the grid sizes of the 2 m 2 m models are the same as those of the 1 m 1 m models the concentrations along the pff bottom boundary cb of the 1 m 1 m and 2 m 2 m models are exactly the same which provides the validity of the 2 m 2 m models although the comparative results are not listed here the plume widths of some cases are not included in fig 10 because cp was less than c 0 as shown in table s4 a or the c 0 isoline intercepted the right model boundary even in the 2 m 2 m models thus plume width w as well as wd wf are omitted in these conditions a model domain larger than 2 m 2 m was not utilized in this study positive values of wd wf in fig 10 indicate that for those cases ndes cause fms to have lower w values than dms in scenario 1 the maximum value of wd wf is 0 0143 m suggesting that ndes have only a slight effect on w under these conditions fig 10 shows also that in scenarios 1 and 2 the plume width change due to ndes shows a positive correlation with θm and 2b and a negative correlation with km this is consistent with the general trends shown in fig 8 which presents relationships between these same parameters and qf d qf f the ndes in fms results in lower specific discharge in pff qf compared to dms as shown in fig 7 which led to greater values of w in fms compared to those of dms as evident in fig 10 in scenario 1 and 2 scenario 3 contains both positive and negative values of wd wf positive values in case a3 and b3 reflect the positive correlation with θm and 2b and a negative correlation with km described above for scenario 1 and 2 negative values of wd wf indicate that ndes cause plume narrowing for those cases this arises from the greater attenuation of the solute plume in dms compared to fms resulting in both lower values of cp and narrower plume widths in the dms of these cases see w values of case d3 in table s4 b when θm 30 45 and 60 cp d values of case c3 are 0 00296 mol m3 0 0021 mol m3 and 0 00173 mol m3 respectively as shown in table s4 b because these low values of cp d are only slightly larger than c 0 10 3 mol m3 recalling that c 0 is used to characterize the plume width the upper edge of the c 0 isoline is close to the pff bottom boundary and hence the plume width is smaller in the dm case compared to the fm case for example wd wf values in case c3 are lower than in case b3 overall the impacts of ndes on plume width prediction in larger 2b conditions i e 2b 0 001 m in this study depend on the parameter combination of km 2b and θm in a more complex manner than the simpler trends that are apparent for smaller 2b cases i e 2b 0 001 m furthermore the reduced w in lower km kf cases from case c3 to d3 see table s4 b is not consistent with sebben and werner 2016b who found that the increase in w is greatest in lower km kf cases this is because as km decreased from case c3 to d3 lower cp that is closer to c 0 was obtained see table s4 a consequently leading to smaller w that calculated by the using of c 0 3 3 3 plume symmetry the influences of ndes on the solute plume symmetry are firstly assessed by the difference in symmetry between dms and fms wl f wr f wl d wr d as presented in fig 11 while the values of wl wr for dms and fms i e wl d wr d and wl f wr f are given in table s4 c note that the values of wl wr are always smaller than 1 because the pff is oblique to the flow direction see fig 2 thus a larger value of wl wr demonstrates a more symmetric plume the wl f wr f wl d wr d values of most conditions in fig 11 are greater than 0 suggesting that the plumes of fms are more symmetric than that of the corresponding dms in these conditions negative values of wl f wr f wl d wr d indicating that the dm produced a more symmetric plume than the fm were obtained for case d3 with θm 30 and 45 the value of wl f wr f wl d wr d in case d3 and θm 45 is 0 077 because cp d is slightly larger than c 0 cp d 0 00108 mol m3 which lead to the smaller value of wr as well as larger wl wr for dm compared to fm wr d 0 42 and wr f 1 45 wl d wr d 0 11015 and wl f wr f 0 03309 and not shown in fig 11 as listed in table s4 c the pattern that wl d wr d increases i e more symmetric plume as km decreases from case c3 to case d3 for dms is not consistent with sebben and werner 2016b this arises from the low values of cp d that is close to c 0 in case d3 which results in smaller wr as well as larger value of wl d wr d fig 11 shows that with the exception of case a1 a small value of km leads to reduced ndes on plume symmetry which is contrary to the earlier observation that smaller km produces increased impacts of ndes on the flow field and peak concentration see fig 8 and fig 9 this is explored further in fig 12 which shows values of wl and wr for the various dm and fm cases fig 12 shows that the values of wl wr are mostly dependent on the wr because the variation in wl is small from case a to e and from scenario 1 to 3 fig 12a also shows that in scenarios 1 and 2 narrower wr were found in fms compared to dms as km reduces or 2b increases which indicates an increased effect of ndes on plume symmetry in scenario 3 the impacts of ndes on wr depend on the parameter combination of km and 2b reduced wr from case b3 to d3 arises from the low cp and w values in these conditions see table s4 a and table s4 b 3 3 4 displacement of the peak solute concentration fig 14 shows the effect of the pff on the solute distribution in different locations above the pff at y 0 5005 m 0 505 m and 0 51 m for case a2 i e km 5 10 3 m s 2b 5 10 3 m fig 14 shows similar results to those of sebben and werner 2016a in that solute distributions between pff models dms and fms and the matrix only models mo gradually match at locations close to the solute source as y decreases i e away from the solute source and approaching the pff top boundary the concentration in pff models gradually deviates from the corresponding matrix only models which indicates that the downstream pff can influence solute distributions in the upstream matrix sebben and werner 2016b proved that smaller km kf or larger 2b could lead to more significant bde thus fig 14 only shows the comparison results of case a2 for different θm conditions as an example to evaluate the influence of ndes and θm on bde the impact of ndes on the displacement of the peak solute concentration lh d lh f is illustrated in fig 13 in all conditions of this study values of lh d lh f are greater than 0 indicating that ndes reduce the plume displacement caused by the pff i e ndes lead to plume distributions along the pff bottom boundary that are shifted upstream the ndes on lh are more pronounced in cases characterized by larger 2b i e from scenario 1 to 3 which is consistent with the earlier observations that larger 2b increases the ndes on tanθf as listed in table 4 that is a larger 2b produces stronger ndes on the flow within the pff as seen in section 3 2 resulting in larger deviation between tanθf d and tanθf f and hence higher lh d lh f values furthermore the cases with larger θm lead to greater values of lh d lh f indicating the influence of ndes on lh is amplified by a larger θm on the other hand a larger 2b or θm would not only produce greater ji j but also prolong the transport distance for solute transport through the pff i e the length of solute migration affected by ndes for a given 2b and θm the lh d lh f variations in alternative km conditions are minimal and close to the horizontal grid resolution δl which is close to 2b near the pff thus the results in fig 12 highlight that the main factors controlling ndes on lh are 2b and θm 3 4 quantification of solute distributions above the pff the peak solute concentration ratios between fms and matrix only models cp f cmo at y 0 5005 m i e top boundary of pff are 0 661 0 634 and 0 649 for θm 30 45 and 60 respectively moreover the peak solute concentration ratios between dms and matrix only model cp d cmo are 0 612 0 569 and 0 572 for θm 30 45 and 60 respectively although the model with θm 45 has the strongest bde compared to the other conditions the degrees of bde in different θm conditions are very close thus it appears that θm has minor influence on the bde fig 13 shows that fms always produce closer results to the matrix only model than dms indicating that nde could release the bde furthermore a larger degree of bde distinction between dms and fms produced as θm increased cp f cmo cp d cmo are 0 048 0 065 and 0 078 when θm 30 45 and 60 at y 0 51 m these results are expected since smaller qf for fms compared to dms will result in less dispersion effect in pff which then decreases the movement of solute back to upstream matrix resulting in more concentrated solute plume in both pff and upper matrix as well as lower degree of bde while ndes may reduce the impact of bdes the simulation results show that bdes still have a major impact on the upstream solute distribution in the fm cases studied here 4 discussion the conceptual model and parameters of dms presented in this study are similar to those of sebben and werner 2016a 2016b enabling us to compare the effects of ndes with fms it is important to note that sebben and werner 2016a 2016b did not examine the influence of ndes on flow and solute transport but the re of the flow in the pff was large enough to exhibit ndes to the best of our knowledge this is the first numerical study that considers non darcian flow in a permeable host matrix through the pff where the matrix flow is oblique to the pff orientation these matrix pff conditions are common in real world sedimentary aquifers with high hydraulic conductivity and complex pff networks nonetheless the results of this study highlight the key differences between dms and fms as well as the main factors driving ndes that have not previously been thoroughly investigated the flow field in the matrix and fluid conservation at the matrix pff interface i e eq 12 specify the pff basic discharge and direction for the conceptual models in this analysis the mass conservation flux at matrix pff interfaces of both dm and fm is depicted in fig 15 for illustration purposes the fluid flux passing through the pff matrix interface in fig 15 can be obtained as 15a q nm ab q m cos θ m 15b q nf ab q f cos θ f note that eq 15 represents fluid fluxes through a unit thickness of the 2d model due to mass conservation in eq 12 the relationship of the flow field between the matrix and pff in eq 15 can be described as 16 q m cos θ m q f cos θ f eq 16 indicates an inverse relationship between the qf and θf when the flow field in the matrix left hand side of eq 16 is the subject as shown in fig 15 considering ndes in the pff result in smaller qf and leads to a smaller θf for fms i e θf f compared to dms i e θf d to produce a greater cross section for fms bd f compared to dms b d d to achieve mass conservation for dms according to eq 11 and eq 16 qf can be easily obtained as 17 q f q m cos θ m 1 tan θ m k f k m 2 eq 17 indicates that a smaller km kf i e smaller km or larger 2b and a larger θm increase qf and as a consequence a larger qf leads to stronger ndes on the pff flow producing greater qf and θf distinctions of fms and dms as shown in fig 8 and table 4 the solute distributions difference between dms and fms can be analyzed by contrasting the ndes impact on the pff flow field that is 1 a larger 2b results in a smaller km kf as well as an increased ratio of viscous dissipation to the total hydraulic gradient ji j that represent the magnitude of ndes larger 2b also leads to longer travel distance for the solute to transport through the pff which could amplify the influence of ndes on solute distribution 2 a smaller km leads to a smaller km kf resulting in a larger ji j as well as stronger ndes and 3 larger θm produces increased θf which can extend the solute transport distance in the pff and then amplify the ndes all of the above parameter variations will increase the ndes on solute distribution in small 2b conditions i e scenario 1 and 2 in current study however in large 2b conditions i e 2b 0 001 m the impact of ndes on solute plume width and symmetry is dependent on the parameter combination of km 2b and θm because the cp of these conditions is close to c 0 the influences of dispersivity and ndes in the pff on plume distributions were evaluated by modifying the matrix and pff longitudinal and transverse dispersivities αlm αlf αtm and αtf respectively for dms in cases a2 to c2 with θm 45 dispersivities were increased to αlm αlf 0 01 m and αtm αtf 0 001 m twice the default values and decreased to αlm αlf 0 0025 m and αtm αtf 0 00025 m half the default values comparison of concentrations along the pff bottom boundary cb between dms with modified dispersivities and fms with default dispersivities are shown in fig s5 fig s5 illustrates that decreasing dispersivity produces more concentrated plume distributions as expected characterized by narrower plume widths and higher peak concentrations this is similar to the influence of ndes see fig 9 and fig 10 which also reduce plume dispersiveness in case a2 fig s5 a the impact of considering ndes was weaker than that of reducing the dispersivities with the higher km in cases b2 and c2 the influence of ndes exceeds that of reducing dispersivities further investigation is required to evaluate the combined controls of ndes and dispersivity on plume distributions in matrix pff systems the ndes on plume distribution above the pff are highlighted by comparing concentrations above the pff between matrix only model fm and dm less pronounced bdes were found in cases that considered non darcian flow in pff compared to others that did not these conclusions can be briefly explained by the flow field distinction which is a smaller specific discharge in the pff of fms producing less of a dispersion effect than dms furthermore the concentration gradient in the matrix pff interfaces decreased the movement of solute from pff to the upper matrix the results above support sebben and werner s 2016b conclusion that the degree of the bde is likely linked to the pe of the pff furthermore when compared to other variables the evaluated bde under various θm conditions shows that θm has a minor effect since the causes of bde are unknown in current studies defining factors that lead to bde were not assessed in this research this is also an area of study that needs to be addressed in future studies to further investigate the impacts of ndes in different matrix pff systems the influence of ndes on the solute distribution was evaluated where the pff is assumed to be filled with materials following the assumption of sebben and werner 2016b identical boundary conditions and parameter settings to those of sebben and werner 2016b were used in the models but with non darcian forchheimer flow within the pff as in eq 7 and eq 9 the results show that the filled pff conditions produce dm and fm outputs that are identical in terms of the flow field discharge and direction solute distribution and plume characteristics indicating that ndes have little effect in filled pff conditions this is a consequence of the small inertial force relative to the viscous force under these conditions ndes were subsequently evaluated using hydraulic gradients in the matrix that were 10 and 100 times i e hydraulic gradients of 1 414 and 14 14 within the matrix respectively greater than those in sebben and werner s models 2016b the results show that significant ndes arose only when the hydraulic gradient within the matrix was 14 14 which is extremely high and nearly impossible to achieve under natural conditions as a result when the pff is filled with porous material ndes in pffs are likely to be negligible in matrix pff systems 5 conclusions the impact of ndes in a single pff on the solute distribution of a permeable aquifer was investigated in this study the forchheimer equation was used to describe non darcian flow within the pff the results of non darcian models flow fields and solute plume distributions were analyzed and compared to those of darcian models in addition sensitivity analysis was performed by modifying the matrix hydraulic conductivity matrix pff aperture and flow direction in the matrix to examine their contribution to ndes impacts the numerical models developed in this study as well as their outputs help us better understand how solute plumes are distributed in complex real world fractured aquifers several conclusions were drawn from this study 1 the specific discharge qf and angle of flow refraction θf in the pff for non darcian models are often smaller than darcian models differences in flow fields caused by ndes are enhanced by smaller km values and larger 2b or θm values 2 non darcian models tend to produce a weaker attenuation effect on the peak concentration of the solute plume relative to darcian models which results in a greater peak solute concentration the impacts of ndes on peak solute concentration increases with smaller km values and larger 2b or θm values 3 when 2b is smaller 2b 0 001 m non darcian models produce narrower plume widths and more symmetric plumes than darcian models a larger difference in the plume i e due to ndes is observed when 2b or θm is larger or when km is smaller as 2b increases 2b 0 001 m the impacts of ndes on plume width and symmetry are determined by the parameter combination of km 2b and θm 4 displacement in the peak solute concentration lh of non darcian models is smaller than that of darcian models the ndes on lh are more pronounced in cases with larger 2b and θm but are minor influenced only slightly by km 5 in cases where km is smaller or 2b is larger back dispersion has a greater impact on solute distribution while θm has only a minor influence back dispersion effects could be reduced by ndes particularly in cases with larger θm the influence of ndes on solute distributions described above can be used to guide the analysis of field and laboratory experiments of pffs embedded within porous media for example if the solute plume observed in experiments is more concentrated or shifted upstream than the simulation result of using the darcian flow assumption for the pffs one can consider ndes in pff flow as a possible cause for the discrepancy in our numerical models 2b 0 0005 m is a key value for the emergence of ndes in pffs indicating that researchers should pay attention to ndes when the aperture of the pff is close to or exceeds 0 0005 m the current study builds on the previous findings of sebben and werner 2016a 2016b as the first step to exploring the role of ndes in pffs embedded within permeable aquifers a range of idealized pff aquifer conditions were considered bounded by typical parameters from real world conditions however due to the limited number of scenarios and idealized conceptualizations of the model other factors relevant to the influence of ndes s such as dispersivity variability in the pff geometry pff networks solute adsorption and precipitation and geomechanical considerations were not evaluated in the current study these factors are likely to modify the importance of ndes on solute transport in pff aquifer systems and thus further research is recommended to study how natural variability might control the influence of ndes on solute transport in real world settings declaration of

3826,on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp salinity area and altitude are the three main environmental gradients and they are also likely to be the main influencing factors of lake water and carbon c sources we collected water samples from lake and river systems on the qtp to determine their associative physical chemical biological and isotopic indicators firstly the ionic composition of individual lake systems on the qtp varied significantly and evaporation was the main controlling factor respective to most of their chemical characteristics secondly glacial meltwater 8 rainwater 26 soil water 28 and the evaporation effect 38 were the main controlling factors of lake water on the qtp atmospheric exchange 72 soil organic matter som 1 and rock weathering 19 were the main dissolved inorganic carbon dic sources of lake water on the qtp thirdly salinity and altitude were the main influencing factors of lake water and c sources especially salinity findings from this study are intended to supplement the knowledge base on c and water coupling effects in plateau lake systems while also improving our understanding on the response of inland lake systems to climate change globally keywords salinity altitude lake area inland water c source δ13c dic geographical pattern 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau qtp known as the core region of earth s third pole li et al 2020 qiu 2008 is the highest plateau in the world globally it is also one of the most sensitive of all of the world s regions to climate change being both a driving force and an amplifier of global climate change yan et al 2018 greater than 1500 lake and large river systems have formed over time in this elevated region such as the yellow river the yangtze river the lancang river and the yarlung zangbo river liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 being severely impacted by global climate change increased precipitation and glacial meltwater as well as decreased evaporation have led to an expansion in water area and a rise in lake water levels on the qtp shugar et al 2020 tang et al 2018 wan et al 2016 over time as snow and ice melts and thaws in the cryosphere plateau lake water supplies may gradually decrease wu and zhu 2008 these factors all indicate that alpine lake and river systems are undergoing and will continue to undergo major changes in carbon c supplies and c cycling processes elser et al 2020 inland water systems i e lakes rivers reservoirs etc whose collective area has been estimated at 3 7 105 km2 feng et al 2016 account for approximately 2 67 of total global area of which greater than 90 of inland waterbody types are lake systems gao et al 2021 moreover inland water systems especially those that act as integrators sentinels or regulators of climate change williamson et al 2009 have a considerable impact on regional climate conditions anderson et al 2020 raymond et al 2013 via water vapor and heat exchanges to the atmosphere tranvik et al 2009 they also play a significant role in c and water cycling processes yan et al 2018 dissolved c will eventually decompose mineralize and be stored in these lake systems until it is released back into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 regulating the transfer of c from the land to the atmosphere armstrong 2010 gao et al 2021 the c that is released annually from stream and river systems has been estimated to reach 1 8 pgc while the corresponding value for lake systems and reservoirs is estimated to reach 0 32 pgc however the sources of this released c remain largely unsubstantiated raymond et al 2013 lake dissolved organic carbon doc pools consist of both autochthonous doc i e that which is produced in lakes and allochthonous doc i e that which is produced in catchments although allochthonous doc is generally believed to represent the larger fraction of total lake doc sobek et al 2007 the main dissolved inorganic carbon dic forms include dissolved co2 bicarbonates hco3 and carbonates co3 2 which are directly connected to fluctuations in water ph and temperature pacheco et al 2014 in inland waters dic can be produced through mineralization and microbial activities in lake systems and their affiliated watersheds matter et al 2016 impacted by terrestrial sources for aquatic based biological transformation processes and associative exchanges at the air water interface dic is both strongly and spatially heterogeneous dic is also closely related to the partial pressure of co2 pco2 which can influence the direction of co2 diffusion at the water air interface wen et al 2017 as a result zonal differentiation characteristics of dissolved carbon dc within inland water systems can act as a reference to assess c storage c cycling and c sources and sinks furthermore c and water coupling characteristics of lake systems on the qtp are unique to themselves chloe et al 2020 characterized by uneven salinity levels and extensive glacial meltwater recharge proportions for example given the high bioavailable doc that exists in glacial meltwater the amount of organic c in lake systems may increase as it receives such doc supplies hood et al 2015 also saline lake systems accumulate and recycle nutrients better than freshwater lake systems blomqvist et al 2004 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 measurements of inland saline and saltwater lake systems have shown that doc and dic levels 21 79 and 93 72 mg l 1 respectively are significantly higher compared to freshwater lake systems 5 80 and 29 38 mg l 1 respectively song et al 2018 wen et al 2016 moreover the surface area of plateau lake systems has also been shown to be an important factor namely it affects lake water sources and can be used as a reliable indicator of climate change kopec et al 2018 tang et al 2018 on the qtp salinity area and altitude are the three main environmental gradients of lake systems and they are also likely to be the main influencing factors of lake water and c sources therefore determining the coupling and driving factors of plateau lake water and affiliated c sources will help us better understand c cycling processes in these lake systems as well as better predict their response to climate change lu et al 2020a lu et al 2020b although researchers have investigated lake water and c sources over the past several decades these studies mostly focused on low saline lake systems in low saline areas moreover there is an obvious scarcity of research specific to the qtp einarsdottir et al 2017 lu et al 2020a lu et al 2020b coupling characteristics of water and c sources have lacked adequate attention and there is currently no consensus on affiliated influencing and controlling factors for this study we assumed that factors associated with salinity altitude and area alter the exogenic inputs of water and reaction processes of carbon which subsequently affect the c source or sink status at the water atmosphere interface the explicit objectives of this study were 1 to determine the ion composition and respective origin of lake and river systems on the qtp 2 to assess the contribution of the main c and water sources in these lake and river systems while exploring associative effects of salinity area and altitude 3 to analyze the direction of c flow at the water air interface and to reveal the coupling relationship between the state of lake c absorption and affiliated water quality with the state of the hydrological process 2 methods 2 1 study site the study area is situated in qinghai province china within the northeastern region of the qtp this region is known as the the source of rivers given that many important rivers i e the yangtze river the yellow river the lanlun river etc originate in this province

hydrochemical composition of lake and river systems as shown in fig 2 the 26 lake and river systems selected for this study were subdivided into three categories according to altitude salinity and area for altitude they were subdivided into high altitude x 3500 mid altitude 2800 x 3500 and low altitude x 2800 for salinity they were subdivided into high salinity x 35 medium salinity 1 x 35 and low salinity 1 for area they were subdivided into large area 500 km2 medium area 100 x 500 km2 and small area x 100 km2 area division was not included in the six river systems selected for this study results showed that ph levels in high saline lake systems were generally low 6 4 8 1 being distributed throughout low and mid altitudes below 3200 m while medium and low saline lake systems were distributed throughout different altitude gradients for most of the lake systems na k were the dominant cations accounting for 60 90 of all cations followed by mg2 approx 20 while corresponding dominant anions followed the order cl 60 80 so4 2 approx 20 0 co3 2 hco3 5 fig 3 all ray intersections occurred within the upper triangular half of the field indicating secondary salinity in water points were mainly distributed within area 7 primary salinity non cate alkali exceeding 50 percent namely the dominant chemical properties were alkalies and strong acids ocean water and many brines were plotted in this area a few points were distributed in area 6 secondary salinity non cate hardness exceeding 50 percent such as lyl and gs r and in area 9 where no cation anion pair in the palmer classification exceeded 50 such as dgl klr and xxl piper 1944 as shown in fig 4 most samples were within the evaporation dominance field indicating that rock weathering and evaporation were the dominant controlling factors of dissolved ions in water bodies on the qtp especially in salt lake systems such as myl and ykl for lake and river systems with lower salinity levels the controlling effect of rainfall was stronger for two of the lake systems especially i e lyl and dgl rock weathering was the main controlling factor the kunlun river also exhibited this tendency indicating that this river carries more ions generated by rock weathering 3 2 differences in dissolved carbon dc concentrations for all water bodies dc concentrations were sorted according to salinity altitude and area respectively fig 5 a b and c for the different river systems dc concentrations were relatively stable river dic remained stable 23 9 33 8 mg l 1 however differences in dc concentrations among the individual lake systems were rather large ranging from 18 9 mg l 1 syl to 183 3 mg l 1 qhl river doc was stable 3 6 8 9 mg l 1 where differences among individual lake systems ranged from 4 5 mg l 1 zll to 83 3 mg l 1 ckl as salinity increased lake doc exhibited an upward trend moreover doc was significantly higher with an average of 36 8 mg l 1 in saline lake systems compared to saltwater bodies 12 4 mg l 1 and freshwater bodies 9 3 mg l 1 p 0 05 the effect of salinity on dic concentrations in water bodies also exhibited the same characteristics the freshwater dic concentration 29 0 mg l 1 was significantly lower than salt lake 62 5 mg l 1 and saltwater 72 0 mg l 1 dic concentrations p 0 05 fig 5e although both altitude and area had a certain influence on lake dc concentrations their influence was not significant p 0 05 overall dic and doc concentrations in mid altitude lake systems were slightly higher than those in high altitude and low altitude lake systems area had no significant effect on lake dc concentrations however lake dc concentrations were significantly higher than river dc concentrations 3 3 differences between δd and δ18o as salinity levels increased both δd and δ18o increased significantly p 0 01 fig 6 a δd increased from the average freshwater lake value 65 0 to the average salt lake value 0 5 δ18o increased from the mean freshwater lake value 9 4 to the mean salt lake value 3 7 in the study area altitude significantly correlated to δd and δ18o r 2 0 94 p 0 001 moreover δd and δ18o in high altitude lake systems with mean values of 59 3 and 8 4 respectively were significantly lower than those in mid altitude with mean values of 12 0 and 0 2 respectively and low altitude with mean values of 22 4 and 1 4 respectively water bodies p 0 01 fig 6a although area had no obvious effect on lake δd and δ18o values river δd and δ18o values with mean values of 60 9 and 9 3 respectively were significantly lower than that of lakes with mean values of 20 0 and 1 1 respectively p 0 001 high saline lake systems such as dtl ykl gsl and dbl within the red circle see fig 6 a fell below the local meteoric water line lmwl indicating that they were significantly affected by evaporation 4 discussion 4 1 using δd and δ18o to identify water sources δd and δ18o can be used as tools to trace water sources ala aho et al 2018 craig 1961 considering the conceptual water cycle model applied to the qtp i e that glacial meltwater is an important source of water replenishment tang et al 2019 and the different isotopic values of endmembers i e the selected end elements that exhibit significant isotopic value differences this study assumed that the main water sources of qtp water bodies derived from glacial meltwater rainwater and soil water however uncertainties related to endmember values will impact results from the isotope mixing model thus representative endmember values were used for this study glacial δd and δ18o meltwater values on the qtp were 208 8 zhang et al 1979 and 10 6 okitsugu et al 1983 respectively rainwater δd and δ18o values on the qtp were 47 0 and 7 1 zeng et al 2020 respectively soil water δd and δ18o values on the qtp were 28 4 and 5 0 xiao et al 2016 respectively evaporation had an significant effect on many lake systems on the qtp causing δd and δ18o isotopes to increase to an extent that the evaporation effect could not reasonably be ignored due to the particularity of lakes on the qtp we introduced the evaporation effect into the isotopic mixing model for calculation it should be noted that this did not mean that evaporation is one of the sources of water the highest values 30 0 and 9 8 sampled from dtl of measured lake water data were used to represent δd and δ18o values of the evaporation effect for purposes of calculation overall glacial meltwater 8 rainwater 26 soil water 28 and the evaporation effect 38 were the main controlling factors of lake water on the qtp on the other hand glacial meltwater 15 rainwater 42 soil water 33 and the evaporation effect 10 were the main controlling factors of river water on the qtp fig 7 the higher the salinity of the lake the stronger the controlling effect of the evaporation effect and the weaker the contributions of soil water rainfall and glacial meltwater p 0 05 the controlling effect of evaporation in high altitude lake systems was significantly weaker than in mid altitude and low altitude lake systems p 0 05 while the contribution of glacial meltwater was greater than in mid altitude and low altitude lake systems p 0 05 which are important reasons why salt lakes do not form at high altitudes the contribution of glacial meltwater to river systems was greater and the contribution of soil water to river and small lake systems was greater than that of large lake systems fig 7 4 2 using δ13c dic to identify dic sources δ13c dic can be used as a tool to trace c sources chen et al 2018 finlay and kendall 2007 schulte et al 2011 the dominant net co2 source in an inland water ecosystem can either be internal water co2 production or dic inflow from external sources similarly in order to reduce the impact of endmember uncertainties on isotope mixing model results representative isotope endmember values were chosen for this study we assumed that δ13c dic values from atmospheric exchange soil organic matter som and rock weathering within qtp water bodies were 1 3 wachniew 2006 23 3 zhou et al 2020 and 9 9 cheng et al 2018 jiang et al 2016 respectively overall atmospheric exchange 71 som 9 and rock weathering 20 were the main lake and river dic sources on the qtp while atmospheric exchange 77 som 8 and rock weathering 16 were the main river dic sources fig 8 the higher the salinity the greater the contribution of atmospheric exchange to lake c for saline lake systems results showed a higher co2 exchange rate with the atmosphere by a factor of 2 5 compared to freshwater lake systems with equivalent co2 concentrations and this was due to the chemical enhancement of the gas transfer velocity yan et al 2018 some salt lake systems exhibited significantly higher δ13c dic which may have resulted from slow lake water renewal processes as well as the long term exchange with heavier lake bottom sediment han et al 2012 there were relatively large differences in the contribution ratio among individual lake systems while there was strong commonality between river systems 4 3 coupling relationship between the state of c absorption and affiliated water quality with the state of the hydrological process in permafrost regions such as the qtp terrestrial organic c is an important source of aquatic doc wherein terrestrial vegetation and soil organic matter are the main contributors ma et al 2019 inland water systems play an important role in the global c cycle by sequestering c in sediment or releasing co2 into the atmosphere lundin et al 2015 marcé et al 2015 by comparing the pco2 in both water and the atmosphere the status of co2 absorption or release of inland water systems can be ascertained xiao et al 2020 because we did not directly measure pco2 we used dic and ph to estimate pco2 in combination with field temperature salinity silicon si and phosphorus p concentration parameters lewis and wallace 1998 van heuven et al 2011 although this method is prone to certain errors and uncertainties in the estimation of inland water systems it still can reflect relative differences golub et al 2017 therefore we only made a qualitative analysis of the results among the 26 inland water bodies investigated 15 were in a net absorption state water pco2 atmospheric pco2 and 11 were in a net release state water pco2 atmospheric pco2 fig 9 which mainly included low altitude saline lake systems and some high altitude water bodies fig 1b different physical chemical and biological characteristics were observed in water bodies influenced by different sources and sinks such as salinity ph orp do and chl a fig 10 and fig s1 there were complex interactions and co occurrence relationships between these characteristics it was observed that the absorption and release of co2 were not affected by altitude that is absorption type lakes and release type lakes are evenly distributed at different altitudes the physical chemical and biological characteristic values of lakes under different co2 absorption states changed significantly with altitude changes whether at high or low altitudes absorption type lakes were often accompanied by lower salinity lower ph and higher intensity of life activities indicated by higher do chl a and orp the salinity of release type lakes at higher altitudes was also lower only at low altitudes high salinity will reduce the co2 sequestration capacity of lakes based on the above analysis qtp lake systems were subdivided into four categories class a low altitude absorption type lake system where lake systems are distributed below 3500 m with dense surrounding vegetation and high do chl a and orp and low salinity and ph class b high altitude absorption type lake system where lakes are distributed above 3500 m with a higher glacial meltwater contribution to lake water and relatively sparse surrounding vegetation and high do chl a and orp and low salinity and ph class c low altitude release type lake system where lakes are distributed below 3500 m and where evaporation has a strong controlling effect on lake water with no surrounding vegetation and low do chl a and orp and high salinity and ph class d high altitude release type lake system where lakes are above 3500 m with sparse surrounding vegetation and low do chl a orp and salinity and high ph fig 10 it is important to note that the above is currently just a hypothesis and thus requires verification through continued data collection into the future it is also important to note that a series of climate change induced chain reactions can alter some lake systems for example a reduction in frozen soil area on the qtp and an increase in the elevation of the lower boundary of frozen soil caused by climate warming wang et al 2005 will lead to an increase in infiltration and a decrease in runoff gao et al 2008 this will in turn will lead to an increase in salinity and a reduction in vegetation which will change a lake system from class a to class c or from class b to class d moreover the c exchange status of the water air interface will change from a sink to a source 5 conclusions the ionic composition among individual lake systems on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp varied significantly while river systems exhibited strong commonality wherein evaporation was the main controlling factor for most of these lake systems an increase in lake salinity led to an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and subsequently an increase in isotopic signatures δd δ18o and δ13c as evaporation strengthened the soil water contribution weakened and the atmospheric exchange contribution to lake c strengthened moreover δd and δ18o values in high altitude lake systems were significantly lower compared to mid altitude and low altitude lake systems contributions from glacial meltwater and evaporation to high altitude inland water bodies were greater compared to low altitude inland water bodies in general although the influence of area on lake water c supplies and c cycling processes was not significant both the influence of salinity and altitude was significant being limited by the supply from specific basins and the lake systems themselves in the future we intend to refine our research on this basis such as supplementing direct and accurate pco2 measurements to better explain the driving mechanisms of the c and water cycling statues of inland water bodies on the qtp this will allow us to explicate and predict the response of different inland water types under a background of global climate change 6 data availability statement lake area data derived from the national science and technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn all data required to perform the

3826,on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp salinity area and altitude are the three main environmental gradients and they are also likely to be the main influencing factors of lake water and carbon c sources we collected water samples from lake and river systems on the qtp to determine their associative physical chemical biological and isotopic indicators firstly the ionic composition of individual lake systems on the qtp varied significantly and evaporation was the main controlling factor respective to most of their chemical characteristics secondly glacial meltwater 8 rainwater 26 soil water 28 and the evaporation effect 38 were the main controlling factors of lake water on the qtp atmospheric exchange 72 soil organic matter som 1 and rock weathering 19 were the main dissolved inorganic carbon dic sources of lake water on the qtp thirdly salinity and altitude were the main influencing factors of lake water and c sources especially salinity findings from this study are intended to supplement the knowledge base on c and water coupling effects in plateau lake systems while also improving our understanding on the response of inland lake systems to climate change globally keywords salinity altitude lake area inland water c source δ13c dic geographical pattern 1 introduction the qinghai tibet plateau qtp known as the core region of earth s third pole li et al 2020 qiu 2008 is the highest plateau in the world globally it is also one of the most sensitive of all of the world s regions to climate change being both a driving force and an amplifier of global climate change yan et al 2018 greater than 1500 lake and large river systems have formed over time in this elevated region such as the yellow river the yangtze river the lancang river and the yarlung zangbo river liu et al 2009 zhang et al 2020 being severely impacted by global climate change increased precipitation and glacial meltwater as well as decreased evaporation have led to an expansion in water area and a rise in lake water levels on the qtp shugar et al 2020 tang et al 2018 wan et al 2016 over time as snow and ice melts and thaws in the cryosphere plateau lake water supplies may gradually decrease wu and zhu 2008 these factors all indicate that alpine lake and river systems are undergoing and will continue to undergo major changes in carbon c supplies and c cycling processes elser et al 2020 inland water systems i e lakes rivers reservoirs etc whose collective area has been estimated at 3 7 105 km2 feng et al 2016 account for approximately 2 67 of total global area of which greater than 90 of inland waterbody types are lake systems gao et al 2021 moreover inland water systems especially those that act as integrators sentinels or regulators of climate change williamson et al 2009 have a considerable impact on regional climate conditions anderson et al 2020 raymond et al 2013 via water vapor and heat exchanges to the atmosphere tranvik et al 2009 they also play a significant role in c and water cycling processes yan et al 2018 dissolved c will eventually decompose mineralize and be stored in these lake systems until it is released back into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide co2 and methane ch4 regulating the transfer of c from the land to the atmosphere armstrong 2010 gao et al 2021 the c that is released annually from stream and river systems has been estimated to reach 1 8 pgc while the corresponding value for lake systems and reservoirs is estimated to reach 0 32 pgc however the sources of this released c remain largely unsubstantiated raymond et al 2013 lake dissolved organic carbon doc pools consist of both autochthonous doc i e that which is produced in lakes and allochthonous doc i e that which is produced in catchments although allochthonous doc is generally believed to represent the larger fraction of total lake doc sobek et al 2007 the main dissolved inorganic carbon dic forms include dissolved co2 bicarbonates hco3 and carbonates co3 2 which are directly connected to fluctuations in water ph and temperature pacheco et al 2014 in inland waters dic can be produced through mineralization and microbial activities in lake systems and their affiliated watersheds matter et al 2016 impacted by terrestrial sources for aquatic based biological transformation processes and associative exchanges at the air water interface dic is both strongly and spatially heterogeneous dic is also closely related to the partial pressure of co2 pco2 which can influence the direction of co2 diffusion at the water air interface wen et al 2017 as a result zonal differentiation characteristics of dissolved carbon dc within inland water systems can act as a reference to assess c storage c cycling and c sources and sinks furthermore c and water coupling characteristics of lake systems on the qtp are unique to themselves chloe et al 2020 characterized by uneven salinity levels and extensive glacial meltwater recharge proportions for example given the high bioavailable doc that exists in glacial meltwater the amount of organic c in lake systems may increase as it receives such doc supplies hood et al 2015 also saline lake systems accumulate and recycle nutrients better than freshwater lake systems blomqvist et al 2004 wurtsbaugh et al 2017 measurements of inland saline and saltwater lake systems have shown that doc and dic levels 21 79 and 93 72 mg l 1 respectively are significantly higher compared to freshwater lake systems 5 80 and 29 38 mg l 1 respectively song et al 2018 wen et al 2016 moreover the surface area of plateau lake systems has also been shown to be an important factor namely it affects lake water sources and can be used as a reliable indicator of climate change kopec et al 2018 tang et al 2018 on the qtp salinity area and altitude are the three main environmental gradients of lake systems and they are also likely to be the main influencing factors of lake water and c sources therefore determining the coupling and driving factors of plateau lake water and affiliated c sources will help us better understand c cycling processes in these lake systems as well as better predict their response to climate change lu et al 2020a lu et al 2020b although researchers have investigated lake water and c sources over the past several decades these studies mostly focused on low saline lake systems in low saline areas moreover there is an obvious scarcity of research specific to the qtp einarsdottir et al 2017 lu et al 2020a lu et al 2020b coupling characteristics of water and c sources have lacked adequate attention and there is currently no consensus on affiliated influencing and controlling factors for this study we assumed that factors associated with salinity altitude and area alter the exogenic inputs of water and reaction processes of carbon which subsequently affect the c source or sink status at the water atmosphere interface the explicit objectives of this study were 1 to determine the ion composition and respective origin of lake and river systems on the qtp 2 to assess the contribution of the main c and water sources in these lake and river systems while exploring associative effects of salinity area and altitude 3 to analyze the direction of c flow at the water air interface and to reveal the coupling relationship between the state of lake c absorption and affiliated water quality with the state of the hydrological process 2 methods 2 1 study site the study area is situated in qinghai province china within the northeastern region of the qtp this region is known as the the source of rivers given that many important rivers i e the yangtze river the yellow river the lanlun river etc originate in this province wang 1992 the plateau climate is cold with an annual average temperature between 5 1 and 9 0 c topography affects the distribution pattern of annual mean temperatures in this region which is high in the north and low in the south the average temperature in january the coolest month is from 17 4 to 4 7 c and the average temperature in july the warmest month is from 5 8 to 20 2 c han et al 2016 although qinghai province receives little precipitation where annual precipitation in most areas is less than 400 mm it experiences large regional differences the overall distribution trend is a gradual increase from the northwest to the southeast liu et al 2020 this province also experiences strong sunshine conditions where the average annual total radiation can reach 5860 7400 mj m 2 qinghai province is comprised of various landform types which mainly include glaciers deserts grassland water bodies woodland and arable land glaciers are mainly distributed within mountainous headwater source areas such as those in the tanggula and kunlun mountains the total water storage capacity of glaciers in qinghai province is 3 95 108 m3 covering an area of approximately 4916 km2 and accounting for 0 68 of the province s land area and 9 2 of china s national glacier area wang 1992 frozen soil is distributed throughout qinghai province of which permafrost accounts for 60 1 and seasonally frozen soil accounts for 39 9 among permafrost types extremely stable frozen soil accounts for only 5 2 mainly distributed in the qilian and daban mountains in northern qinghai province stable and metastable frozen soil accounts for 49 2 mainly distributed in the southern plateau of qinghai province mainly in hoh xil transitional and unstable frozen soil accounts for 45 6 mainly distributed in the valleys of the yangtze river and yellow river basins li et al 2005 zhang et al 2007 furthermore qinghai province vegetation types are complex which mainly include grasslands forest shrubs alpine shrubs and alpine meadows dai et al 2018 2 2 sample collection and analysis as shown in fig 1 a total of 85 sampling points were established at 20 of the main lake and 6 of the main river systems across qinghai province table s1 whose altitudes range between 2550 and 4542 m areas range between 5 and 4346 km2 and salinity levels range between 0 0 and 196 0 these sites were primarily selected due to their relatively easy access and typical water body representativeness all including salinity area and altitude properties from july 9 2020 to july 23 2020 samples were collected from each sampling point during sampling we used two 100 ml polyethylene plastic bottles to collect surface water samples 0 5 cm and ensured that no bubbles formed in any sample bottle prior to sampling previously unused collection bottles were washed in deionized di water three separate times during sampling we used in situ natural water taken at the sampling points to moisten and wash

transferred to the institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences igsnrr cas and stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to analysis water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm organic microporous membrane filters where the organic microporous membrane filters were first treated in a water bath at 80 c for 8 h prior to filtering the samples were used

hydrochemical composition of lake and river systems as shown in fig 2 the 26 lake and river systems selected for this study were subdivided into three categories according to altitude salinity and area for altitude they were subdivided into high altitude x 3500 mid altitude 2800 x 3500 and low altitude x 2800 for salinity they were subdivided into high salinity x 35 medium salinity 1 x 35 and low salinity 1 for area they were subdivided into large area 500 km2 medium area 100 x 500 km2 and small area x 100 km2 area division was not included in the six river systems selected for this study results showed that ph levels in high saline lake systems were generally low 6 4 8 1 being distributed throughout low and mid altitudes below 3200 m while medium and low saline lake systems were distributed throughout different altitude gradients for most of the lake systems na k were the dominant cations accounting for 60 90 of all cations followed by mg2 approx 20 while corresponding dominant anions followed the order cl 60 80 so4 2 approx 20 0 co3 2 hco3 5 fig 3 all ray intersections occurred within the upper triangular half of the field indicating secondary salinity in water points were mainly distributed within area 7 primary salinity non cate alkali exceeding 50 percent namely the dominant chemical properties were alkalies and strong acids ocean water and many brines were plotted in this area a few points were distributed in area 6 secondary salinity non cate hardness exceeding 50 percent such as lyl and gs r and in area 9 where no cation anion pair in the palmer classification exceeded 50 such as dgl klr and xxl piper 1944 as shown in fig 4 most samples were within the evaporation dominance field indicating that rock weathering and evaporation were the dominant controlling factors of dissolved ions in water bodies on the qtp especially in salt lake systems such as myl and ykl for lake and river systems with lower salinity levels the controlling effect of rainfall was stronger for two of the lake systems especially i e lyl and dgl rock weathering was the main controlling factor the kunlun river also exhibited this tendency indicating that this river carries more ions generated by rock weathering 3 2 differences in dissolved carbon dc concentrations for all water bodies dc concentrations were sorted according to salinity altitude and area respectively fig 5 a b and c for the different river systems dc concentrations were relatively stable river dic remained stable 23 9 33 8 mg l 1 however differences in dc concentrations among the individual lake systems were rather large ranging from 18 9 mg l 1 syl to 183 3 mg l 1 qhl river doc was stable 3 6 8 9 mg l 1 where differences among individual lake systems ranged from 4 5 mg l 1 zll to 83 3 mg l 1 ckl as salinity increased lake doc exhibited an upward trend moreover doc was significantly higher with an average of 36 8 mg l 1 in saline lake systems compared to saltwater bodies 12 4 mg l 1 and freshwater bodies 9 3 mg l 1 p 0 05 the effect of salinity on dic concentrations in water bodies also exhibited the same characteristics the freshwater dic concentration 29 0 mg l 1 was significantly lower than salt lake 62 5 mg l 1 and saltwater 72 0 mg l 1 dic concentrations p 0 05 fig 5e although both altitude and area had a certain influence on lake dc concentrations their influence was not significant p 0 05 overall dic and doc concentrations in mid altitude lake systems were slightly higher than those in high altitude and low altitude lake systems area had no significant effect on lake dc concentrations however lake dc concentrations were significantly higher than river dc concentrations 3 3 differences between δd and δ18o as salinity levels increased both δd and δ18o increased significantly p 0 01 fig 6 a δd increased from the average freshwater lake value 65 0 to the average salt lake value 0 5 δ18o increased from the mean freshwater lake value 9 4 to the mean salt lake value 3 7 in the study area altitude significantly correlated to δd and δ18o r 2 0 94 p 0 001 moreover δd and δ18o in high altitude lake systems with mean values of 59 3 and 8 4 respectively were significantly lower than those in mid altitude with mean values of 12 0 and 0 2 respectively and low altitude with mean values of 22 4 and 1 4 respectively water bodies p 0 01 fig 6a although area had no obvious effect on lake δd and δ18o values river δd and δ18o values with mean values of 60 9 and 9 3 respectively were significantly lower than that of lakes with mean values of 20 0 and 1 1 respectively p 0 001 high saline lake systems such as dtl ykl gsl and dbl within the red circle see fig 6 a fell below the local meteoric water line lmwl indicating that they were significantly affected by evaporation 4 discussion 4 1 using δd and δ18o to identify water sources δd and δ18o can be used as tools to trace water sources ala aho et al 2018 craig 1961 considering the conceptual water cycle model applied to the qtp i e that glacial meltwater is an important source of water replenishment tang et al 2019 and the different isotopic values of endmembers i e the selected end elements that exhibit significant isotopic value differences this study assumed that the main water sources of qtp water bodies derived from glacial meltwater rainwater and soil water however uncertainties related to endmember values will impact results from the isotope mixing model thus representative endmember values were used for this study glacial δd and δ18o meltwater values on the qtp were 208 8 zhang et al 1979 and 10 6 okitsugu et al 1983 respectively rainwater δd and δ18o values on the qtp were 47 0 and 7 1 zeng et al 2020 respectively soil water δd and δ18o values on the qtp were 28 4 and 5 0 xiao et al 2016 respectively evaporation had an significant effect on many lake systems on the qtp causing δd and δ18o isotopes to increase to an extent that the evaporation effect could not reasonably be ignored due to the particularity of lakes on the qtp we introduced the evaporation effect into the isotopic mixing model for calculation it should be noted that this did not mean that evaporation is one of the sources of water the highest values 30 0 and 9 8 sampled from dtl of measured lake water data were used to represent δd and δ18o values of the evaporation effect for purposes of calculation overall glacial meltwater 8 rainwater 26 soil water 28 and the evaporation effect 38 were the main controlling factors of lake water on the qtp on the other hand glacial meltwater 15 rainwater 42 soil water 33 and the evaporation effect 10 were the main controlling factors of river water on the qtp fig 7 the higher the salinity of the lake the stronger the controlling effect of the evaporation effect and the weaker the contributions of soil water rainfall and glacial meltwater p 0 05 the controlling effect of evaporation in high altitude lake systems was significantly weaker than in mid altitude and low altitude lake systems p 0 05 while the contribution of glacial meltwater was greater than in mid altitude and low altitude lake systems p 0 05 which are important reasons why salt lakes do not form at high altitudes the contribution of glacial meltwater to river systems was greater and the contribution of soil water to river and small lake systems was greater than that of large lake systems fig 7 4 2 using δ13c dic to identify dic sources δ13c dic can be used as a tool to trace c sources chen et al 2018 finlay and kendall 2007 schulte et al 2011 the dominant net co2 source in an inland water ecosystem can either be internal water co2 production or dic inflow from external sources similarly in order to reduce the impact of endmember uncertainties on isotope mixing model results representative isotope endmember values were chosen for this study we assumed that δ13c dic values from atmospheric exchange soil organic matter som and rock weathering within qtp water bodies were 1 3 wachniew 2006 23 3 zhou et al 2020 and 9 9 cheng et al 2018 jiang et al 2016 respectively overall atmospheric exchange 71 som 9 and rock weathering 20 were the main lake and river dic sources on the qtp while atmospheric exchange 77 som 8 and rock weathering 16 were the main river dic sources fig 8 the higher the salinity the greater the contribution of atmospheric exchange to lake c for saline lake systems results showed a higher co2 exchange rate with the atmosphere by a factor of 2 5 compared to freshwater lake systems with equivalent co2 concentrations and this was due to the chemical enhancement of the gas transfer velocity yan et al 2018 some salt lake systems exhibited significantly higher δ13c dic which may have resulted from slow lake water renewal processes as well as the long term exchange with heavier lake bottom sediment han et al 2012 there were relatively large differences in the contribution ratio among individual lake systems while there was strong commonality between river systems 4 3 coupling relationship between the state of c absorption and affiliated water quality with the state of the hydrological process in permafrost regions such as the qtp terrestrial organic c is an important source of aquatic doc wherein terrestrial vegetation and soil organic matter are the main contributors ma et al 2019 inland water systems play an important role in the global c cycle by sequestering c in sediment or releasing co2 into the atmosphere lundin et al 2015 marcé et al 2015 by comparing the pco2 in both water and the atmosphere the status of co2 absorption or release of inland water systems can be ascertained xiao et al 2020 because we did not directly measure pco2 we used dic and ph to estimate pco2 in combination with field temperature salinity silicon si and phosphorus p concentration parameters lewis and wallace 1998 van heuven et al 2011 although this method is prone to certain errors and uncertainties in the estimation of inland water systems it still can reflect relative differences golub et al 2017 therefore we only made a qualitative analysis of the results among the 26 inland water bodies investigated 15 were in a net absorption state water pco2 atmospheric pco2 and 11 were in a net release state water pco2 atmospheric pco2 fig 9 which mainly included low altitude saline lake systems and some high altitude water bodies fig 1b different physical chemical and biological characteristics were observed in water bodies influenced by different sources and sinks such as salinity ph orp do and chl a fig 10 and fig s1 there were complex interactions and co occurrence relationships between these characteristics it was observed that the absorption and release of co2 were not affected by altitude that is absorption type lakes and release type lakes are evenly distributed at different altitudes the physical chemical and biological characteristic values of lakes under different co2 absorption states changed significantly with altitude changes whether at high or low altitudes absorption type lakes were often accompanied by lower salinity lower ph and higher intensity of life activities indicated by higher do chl a and orp the salinity of release type lakes at higher altitudes was also lower only at low altitudes high salinity will reduce the co2 sequestration capacity of lakes based on the above analysis qtp lake systems were subdivided into four categories class a low altitude absorption type lake system where lake systems are distributed below 3500 m with dense surrounding vegetation and high do chl a and orp and low salinity and ph class b high altitude absorption type lake system where lakes are distributed above 3500 m with a higher glacial meltwater contribution to lake water and relatively sparse surrounding vegetation and high do chl a and orp and low salinity and ph class c low altitude release type lake system where lakes are distributed below 3500 m and where evaporation has a strong controlling effect on lake water with no surrounding vegetation and low do chl a and orp and high salinity and ph class d high altitude release type lake system where lakes are above 3500 m with sparse surrounding vegetation and low do chl a orp and salinity and high ph fig 10 it is important to note that the above is currently just a hypothesis and thus requires verification through continued data collection into the future it is also important to note that a series of climate change induced chain reactions can alter some lake systems for example a reduction in frozen soil area on the qtp and an increase in the elevation of the lower boundary of frozen soil caused by climate warming wang et al 2005 will lead to an increase in infiltration and a decrease in runoff gao et al 2008 this will in turn will lead to an increase in salinity and a reduction in vegetation which will change a lake system from class a to class c or from class b to class d moreover the c exchange status of the water air interface will change from a sink to a source 5 conclusions the ionic composition among individual lake systems on the qinghai tibet plateau qtp varied significantly while river systems exhibited strong commonality wherein evaporation was the main controlling factor for most of these lake systems an increase in lake salinity led to an increase in dissolved inorganic carbon dic and dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations and subsequently an increase in isotopic signatures δd δ18o and δ13c as evaporation strengthened the soil water contribution weakened and the atmospheric exchange contribution to lake c strengthened moreover δd and δ18o values in high altitude lake systems were significantly lower compared to mid altitude and low altitude lake systems contributions from glacial meltwater and evaporation to high altitude inland water bodies were greater compared to low altitude inland water bodies in general although the influence of area on lake water c supplies and c cycling processes was not significant both the influence of salinity and altitude was significant being limited by the supply from specific basins and the lake systems themselves in the future we intend to refine our research on this basis such as supplementing direct and accurate pco2 measurements to better explain the driving mechanisms of the c and water cycling statues of inland water bodies on the qtp this will allow us to explicate and predict the response of different inland water types under a background of global climate change 6 data availability statement lake area data derived from the national science and technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn all data required to perform the

3827,river nitrate no3 pollution is ubiquitous and has attracted worldwide attention the continuous increase nitrate flux in the river system is mainly caused by inputs of exogenous nitrate sources or nitrogen transformations in this study coupled nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate were used to identify sources and transformations of nitrate in a mixed land use watershed of southern china the beijiang river basin aimed at evaluating the impacts of sources or transformations on nitrate pollution and provide guidance for aquatic environment management the results showed that the no3 n flux in the beijiang river basin was 9 37 104 tons in 2015 isotopic evidence indicated that the impacts of nitrogen transformations in the river on the removal and production of nitrate were not significant and the increased no3 n concentration along the river was caused by inputs of exogenous nitrate sources the isotope based source apportionment revealed that approximately 52 of the influx no3 n was contributed by synthetic fertilizer 27 by soil nitrogen and 21 by domestic sewage there was no significant temporal variations in source apportionment however significant spatial variations were found across the study area the spatial variations were mainly affected by the different land use patterns with the increasing percentage of urbanized areas the proportional contributions of domestic sewage have increased which has resulted in an increased no3 n concentration in addition the relationships between the land use index and proportional contributions of different nitrate sources suggested that the effect of urbanized area might be more pronounced on nitrate pollution in a mixed land use watershed therefore the results of this study suggested that land use should be considered in nitrate pollution management strategies and reducing inputs of nitrate sources to river water is crucial to reducing nitrate pollution in mixed land use watersheds keywords nitrate source apportionment transformation land use 1 introduction intensive human activities have greatly altered the global nitrogen n cycle resulting in increased amounts of reactive n in the atmosphere landscape and water boyer et al 2006 fowler et al 2013 the global n delivery to rivers and streams increased from 34 tg n yr 1 to 64 tg n yr 1 over the 20th century beusen et al 2016 of all nitrogen species nitrate nitrogen no3 n is dominant and its concentrations in rivers have risen above acceptable levels 10 mg l 1 in many areas of the world kendall et al 2007 for example in china approximately 7 83 of surface water bodies that have an average no3 n concentration above the 10 mg l 1 over the last 8 years zhang et al 2020 high concentrations of no3 n in rivers can pose serious threats to local aquatic ecosystems e g eutrophication and can cause sanitary problems associated with drinking water briand et al 2017 kendall et al 2007 therefore tracing the cause of the increased nitrate concentration and flux in rivers is crucial for water quality management and has important implications for regional and global n cycling the increased no3 n concentration in river water originates from 1 inputs of exogenous nitrate sources and 2 contributions of n transformations in river systems xuan et al 2020a terrestrial nitrate sources are typically classified as point and nonpoint sources ongley et al 2010 yi et al 2020 the point sources of nitrate mainly originate from the discharge of domestic sewage and agricultural or industrial wastewater cejudo et al 2018 popescu et al 2015 xuan et al 2019 the nonpoint sources of nitrate enter rivers in a diffused manner and mainly include soil nitrogen atmospheric deposition agricultural fertilizer and livestock manure inácio et al 2015 lu et al 2015 yue et al 2014 previous studies have suggested that point sources are the dominant nitrate source in urbanized areas archana et al 2016 liu et al 2018 xuan et al 2020a while nonpoint sources are the major nitrate sources in agricultural areas han et al 2018 ongley et al 2010 however in recent years urban land use has increased followed by increased point sources in agricultural watersheds due to the development of urbanization and an increasing population xuan et al 2019 this has resulted in mixed land uses and highly complex source distributions of nitrate therefore the estimation of nitrate source apportionment in a mixed land use watershed could provide further information on nitrate pollution in developing regions exogenous nitrate source input is the primary driver of increased nitrate concentrations because all nitrate originates from an exogenous source unless nitrate is generated naturally through n fixation at a site the exogenous nitrate source is later transformed by biogeochemical processes in the river ecosystem which would resulted in increased nitrate concentrations in the rivers thus n transformation plays a nonnegligible role in nitrate accumulations in river ecosystems mclaughlin et al 2017 xuan et al 2020a n transformations in river ecosystems can be classified into nitrate removal and production processes denitrification and assimilation are typical nitrate removal processes however nitrification is a process of nitrate production denk et al 2017 our previous study in an urbanized watershed suggested that sewage with a high concentration of ammonia nh4 could promote nitrification and repress the removal of no3 by assimilation which resulted in nitrate accumulation in the river ecosystem xuan et al 2020a however in a mixed land use watershed that is characterized by a lower nh4 concentration how n transformations affect nitrate concentrations and nitrate flux in the river still needs to be elucidated therefore for water environment management at the basin scale it is essential to determine nitrate sources identify the transformations of n and investigate the impacts of nitrate sources and n transformations on nitrate flux in mixed land use watersheds source contributions and transformations of nitrate are impacted by changes in land use and runoff land use is recognized as the original factor affecting source contributions in general increasing forest or agricultural areas leads to increased nonpoint sources lin et al 2015 and urbanization often results in increased point sources bu et al 2014 runoff is the driving force for nitrate discharge into river water and exhibits a significant control on the migration distribution and transformation of nitrate xuan et al 2020b for example increased runoff leads to increased erosive processes which results in increased contributions of nonpoint sources to river water during the wet season li et al 2019a xuan et al 2019 in addition compared with the dry season biogeochemical processes in rivers are weak during the wet season because of the increased runoff rates xuan et al 2020a compared with traditional static environmental management dynamic water environmental management needs to be carried out on the basis of the dynamic characteristics of river hydrology and pollution source discharge however on the watershed scale a complex mix of land uses result in a complex mix of pollutant sources that include both point and nonpoint sources it is difficult to carry out quantitative source analysis work which makes it impossible to perform targeted water environmental management work therefore to improve surface water quality and watershed management it is important to understand the characteristics of temporal and spatial variations in no3 source apportionments and impacts of land use and runoff on the origin distribution and fate of nitrate in river ecosystems the recognition of sources and transformations of nitrate at different temporal and spatial scales is a challenge for river ecosystem studies among many methods stable nitrogen isotope δ15n combined with oxygen isotope δ18o offer a direct means of source identification and can be used to describe the biogeochemical processes of nitrate denk et al 2017 jani and toor 2018 kendall et al 2007 kruk et al 2020 luu et al 2020 meghdadi and javar 2018 yi et al 2020 different sources of nitrate often have distinct isotopic signatures for example synthetic fertilizer generally exhibits depleted δ15n values 5 9 to 1 9 relative to livestock manure 4 9 to 20 9 or domestic sewage 4 to 19 choi et al 2017 xue et al 2009 the δ18o values of atmospheric no3 are generally higher 25 to 75 than those of other sources 25 casciotti et al 2010 xue et al 2009 in addition biological processes of n often change isotopic ratios in predictable and recognizable directions that can leave distinguishable signatures on the isotopic composition of nitrate for example the denitrification process leads to the simultaneous increase in residual δ15n and δ18o in nitrate and the ratios are assumed to be close to 1 5 1 or even 2 1 denk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 however the assimilation process can result in an increase in the δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining nitrate close to 1 1 during no3 uptake by phytoplankton granger et al 2004 therefore in this study dual isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were measured in monthly river water samples in a mixed land use river basin to quantify source apportionments and to identify n transformations the beijiang river basin has a typical subtropical monsoon climate and is characterized by warm and humid summer monsoons as well as cool and dry winter monsoons resulting in high seasonal variation in runoff seasonal changes in runoff might affect source apportionment and nitrate pollution thus monthly research was conducted in this study in addition the beijiang river basin is a typical mixed land use watershed with high proportions of forest and agricultural land during the last two decades the region in the beijiang river basin has experienced explosive economic growth leading to increased urbanized land areas and human activities li et al 2019b xuan et al 2019 land use changes are the main factors that alter riverine n origins although previous studies have shown that nitrate sources have spatial variability chen et al 2009 xuan et al 2019 few studies have focused on the impacts of different land uses on nitrate sources and nitrate pollution therefore in this study the spatio temporal variations in nitrate sources and transformations were identified based on coupled nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate over one hydrological year in the beijiang river basin the objective of this study was to reveal whether nitrate pollution was caused by exogenous input or n transformations in a mixed land use watershed and investigate the factors affecting spatial temporal variations in nitrate pollution specifically the study 1 identified n transformations and discussed the impacts of n transformations on nitrate flux 2 quantified nitrate source apportionment and discussed factors affecting its temporal and spatial variations and 3 established relationships between land use and nitrate isotopes and investigated the impacts of land use on nitrate pollution the novel aspect of this study is to reveal quantitatively the relationship between land use and nitrate of the river water which would provide some new insights to spatial patterns of nitrate in the river water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the beijiang river is the second largest tributary of the pearl river and is located in southeastern china fig 1 the beijiang river basin covers an area of 52 068 km2 and has a total length of 573 km cao et al 2020 in the river basin the annual mean temperature ranges between 14 and 22 c and the annual mean precipitation ranges between 1390 and 2475 mm li et al 2019b luo et al 2008 the river basin is located in a subtropical monsoon climate zone and is characterized by warm and humid summer monsoons as well as cool and dry winter monsoons xuan et al 2019 resulting in highly seasonal variations in runoff and nutrient loads the annual mean runoff of the river basin is 4 3 billion m3 with 70 to 80 of the flux occurring in the wet season according to runoff data from the guangdong water resources bulletin http www pearlwater gov cn covering a period of 65 years 1951 2015 the flood period is concentrated in the wet season april to september while the lowest runoff occurs in the dry season october to march the beijiang river basin is a mixed land use watershed with a high proportion of areas containing forests and agricultural lands fig 1 since the reform and opening up of chinese economic policies lin 2014 the region has experienced explosive economic growth over the last 20 years resulting in increased urbanized areas and populations the percentages of forested agricultural and urbanized lands within the beijiang river basin were 74 3 19 2 and 1 3 respectively in the 1980 s xuan et al 2019 in 2015 the percentages of forest and agricultural areas decreased to 72 4 and 18 7 respectively and the percentage of urbanized area increased to 3 0 fig 1 in addition according to data from the guangdong statistical yearbook http stats gd gov cn gdtjnj index html the chemical fertilizer application in the beijiang river basin is estimated to be approximate 4 16 104 ton in 1990 11 21 104 ton in 2005 and 6 40 104 ton in 2015 therefore the effects of different land uses on nutrient loads might change and high loads of anthropogenic nutrients would have profound effects on the source distribution and transformations of nitrogen 2 2 sampling collection in this study river water samples were collected at 15 hydrological stations table s1 in the beijiang river basin on the first day of every month in 2015 fig 1 at each sampling site surface water samples 0 5 m below the air water interface were collected with a portable water sampler all water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter and stored in 100 ml tubes below 4 c until analysis in addition to calculate of nitrate source apportionments samples of the potential sources were collected twenty two soil samples were collected along the mainstream domestic sewage samples n 5 were collected from the sewage outlet 2 3 analysis method field parameters for the river water samples including temperature t ph electric conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do concentration were measured in situ using portable multiparameter equipment ysi exo2 xylem brand usa that was calibrated before measurements were taken the concentrations of nitrate n no3 n were analyzed by a continuous flow injection analyzer ams alliance integral futura frepillon france with a detection limit of 0 02 mg l 1 the nitrogen n and oxygen o isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were analyzed using the bacterial denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 briefly the no3 of the river water was converted to n2o by denitrifying bacteria that lack n2o reductase activity the cells of denitrifying bacteria were concentrated 4 5 fold and then transferred into 10 ml headspace vials the vials were purged with high purity n2 for at least 3 h to ensure anaerobic conditions a sample amount of 60 nmol no3 n was injected into the vials and then cultured to convert no3 to n2o then n2o was extracted and purified through a precon system thermo fisher and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta advantage v thermo fisher the δ15n and δ18o measurement systems were calibrated with the international reference standards of iaea n3 4 7 0 2 for δ15n and 25 6 0 4 for δ18o usgs34 1 8 0 2 for δ15n and 27 9 0 4 for δ18o and usgs35 2 7 0 2 for δ15n and 57 5 0 3 for δ18o the analytical precisions for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were 0 4 and 0 5 respectively in addition to investigate the nitrification of nitrate the o isotope of river water δ18o h2o was analyzed the δ18o h2o values were analyzed using a high precision laser isotope analyzer picarro l2130i with an analytical precision of 0 01 soil samples were freeze dried at 80 c for 72 h the dried samples were then ground in an agate grinder and sieved through a 0 149 mm mesh for further analysis prior to analysis of the contents and isotopes of c any possible inorganic carbonates were removed from the samples by acidification with 0 5 mol l 1 hcl and the samples was then rinsed with deionized water until the filtrate ph was neutral yamamuro and kayanne 1995 stable nitrogen isotopic analysis of soil samples

analysis 2 4 1 land use index lui calculation to statistically correlate variables and source apportionments of nitrate with land use a landscape metric referred to as the land use index lui was developed ometo et al 2000 this index is the sum of land use percentages weighted by the following values natural areas including forest bush fallow wetland and water 0 grass areas 0 2 agricultural areas 0 5 and urbanized areas 5 the weight of each land use type was given based on two criteria 1 the effect of land use on nitrate pollution and 2 the effect of land use on nitrogen isotopes and which was obtained from the literatures ometo et al 2000 zorzal almeida et al 2018 fifteen nested subcatchments were divided based on the 15 sampling sites and selected raster digital elevation model dem using the hydrological analysis module of arcgis 10 2 fig s1 the extraction of the watershed was based on a dem with a 30 m resolution the different land use percentages of each catchment were calculated by the hydrological module in arcgis 10 2 based on a land use map provided by the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science technology infrastructure of

table 1 2 4 2 source apportionments calculation to quantify the contributions of different sources to nitrate in river water a bayesian stable isotope mixing model stable isotopic analysis in r siar was used based on the n and o isotopes of nitrate parnell and jackson 2010 semmens et al 2009 the siar mixing model can be expressed as follows x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 1 ε jk n 0 σ j 2 where xij is the isotope value j of the mixture i in which i 1 2 3 i and j 1 2 3 j sjk is the source value k on isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean μjk and standard deviation ωjk pk is the proportion of source k which needs to be estimated by siar model cjk is the fractionation factor for isotope j on source k and is normally distributed with

no3 j 2 and three potential sources synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were considered the end members of different sources in this study were determined by measured values or selected by referring to the data obtained from commonly used sources table 2 the end member value of δ15n no3 from synthetic fertilizer 1 2 0 4 was obtained from the literature choi et al 2017 the end members of δ15n no3 for domestic sewage 15 8 0 8 and soil nitrogen 9 6 2 2 were determined based on 5 domestic sewage samples and 22 soil samples respectively distributed along the river the end members of δ18o no3 for synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were designated as having the same value 2 9 0 6 yi et al 2020 the nitrate from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen experienced microbial processes all of which had typical δ18o no3 values and were different from the δ18o values in atmospheric deposited sources xue et al 2009 the fractionation factors for all sources were set to zero cjk 0 in eq 1 because corresponding experiments for determining enrichment factors were not conducted and no significant isotope fraction signals were observed in this study 2 4 3 runoff data collection and nitrate flux calculation monthly river runoff in 2015 was obtained from 15 hydrological monitoring stations 15 sampling sites the monthly no3 n flux f m and annual no3 n flux f a was estimated using the monthly average no3 n concentration c m and monthly runoff q m at each hydrological stations as follows 2 f m c m q m t m 10 6 3 f a m 1 m c m q m t m 10 6 where q m m3 s 1 is the monthly average runoff at each hydrological station in which m 1 2 3 12 c m mg l 1 is the no3 n concentration of samples collected every month at each sampling site which is regarded as the average no3 n concentration for every month t m s is the time of every month f m ton month 1 is the monthly no3 n flux at each sampling site f m ton year 1 is the annual no3 n flux at

14 0 68 mg l 1 the two way anova showed that the spatial difference in the no3 n concentration was significant p 0 01 table 3 the monthly averaged no3 n concentration was the highest at the wj hydrological station 2 43 0 66 mg l 1 and was the lowest at the hjt hydrological station 0 30 0 18 mg l 1 table 3 in addition the no3 n concentration showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream in the mainstream of the beijiang river fig 3 a the no3 n concentrations was higher in the urbanized and agricultural areas than that in the forest areas fig 4 which indicated that the increases of nitrate concentration in the rivers might be contributed to human activities in terms of the whole river basin the two way anova showed a temporal varation in the no3 n concentration between wet and dry seasons p 0 05 table 3 for each of the sampling points the one way anova showed that there was a temporal change of no3 n concentration only at the sampling points of yd jlw and wj stations and that was higher in the dry season table 3 the overall δ15n no3 values varied from 1 19 to 12 60 with an average value of 5 07 3 21 the two way anova showed that the spatial difference in the δ15n no3 value was significant p 0 01 table 3 the δ15n no3 values showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream in the mainstream of the beijiang river fig 3c in the tributary the monthly averaged δ15n no3 value was lowest at the jlw hydrological station 1 16 0 01 which was located upstream of the beijiang river basin in addition the monthly averaged δ15n no3 value was higher at the wj hydrological station 8 69 2 17 sj hydrological station 8 67 1 33 and flx hydrological station 7 48 0 73 where the dominant land use was urban table 3 and fig 4 which indicated that domestic sewage which was characterized by higher δ15n no3 signature might be the dominant nitrate source the two way anova showed that there was no temporal varation in the δ15n no3 value between wet and dry seasons p 0 05 table 3 for each of the sampling points a significant temporal variation in the δ15n no3 value was only found at the sampling point of sj station by the one way anova table 3 the δ15n no3

mainstream of the beijiang river fig 3d with higher monthly averaged value at the sj hydrological station 2 70 0 83 and flx hydrological station 2 30 0 72 table 3 in addition in the tributary the δ18o no3 values were also higher at the gd hydrological station 2 98 1 46 table 3 the higher δ18o no3 values were shown in the downstream of the river where is located in the urbanized area fig 4 which might be related to human activities the two way anova showed that there was no temporal varation in the δ18o no3 value between wet and dry seasons p 0 05 table 3 for each of the sampling points a significant temporal variation in the δ18o no3 value was only found at the sampling point of sk station by the one way anova table 3 the δ18o no3 values of samples from the sk station were higher in

showed that nitrate in the beijiang river basin mainly originated from sources of synthetic fertilizer sewage manure and soil nitrogen fig 5 the source apportionment of no3 seems to be related to land use most of the samples with higher lui values 20 fell within the range of the sewage manure zone however most of the samples with lower lui values 20 fell within the synthetic fertilizer and soil nitrogen zones fig 5a and c both the plot of δ15n no3 with δ18o no3 and the plot of no3 cl ratios with cl molar concentrations suggested that most of samples from main stream mainly originated from sewage manure source while most of samples of tributary mainly originated from agricultural fertilizer source fig 5a and fig 5c in addition the distribution of no3 sources seemed to be less related to seasonal changes fig 5b and 5d the siar mixing model outputs of the no3 proportional contributions are presented in fig 6 overall in the beijiang river basin synthetic fertilizer was the predominant no3 source mean probability estimate mpe of 52 soil nitrogen was the second no3 contributor mpe of 27 and domestic sewage contributed the least mpe of 21 in addition the one way anova showed that the no3 source apportionment pattern had a significant spatial variation p 0 01 but no significant temporal variation p 0 05 among all the hydrological stations the proportional contribution of synthetic fertilizer demonstrated the highest value at the jlw station mpe of 98 5 and the lowest values at the wj and sj stations mpe of 28 in contrast the proportional contributions of soil nitrogen and domestic sewage were lowest at the jlw station mpe of 1 and 0 5 respectivly however at the wj and sj stations the proportional contributions of soil nitrogen were higher with monthly averaged of 38 and 37 respectively additionally the proportional contributions of domestic sewage were higher at the flx wj and sj stations mpe of 35 34 and 34 respectively 3 4 nitrate flux based on the data of the sj station which is located at the river mouth of the beijiang river the no3 n flux for the whole river basin was 9 37 104 tons during the hydrological year of 2015 with 76 of the no3 n flux being produced in the wet season in addition the no3 n flux showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream in the mainstream of the beijiang river and this trend was consistent with that of the no3 n concentration fig 3 based on the proportional contributions of different nitrate sources at the sj station in the downstream of the beijiang river basin the no3 n fluxes from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were estimated to be 2 66 104 tons 3 22 104 tons and 3 49 104 tons respectively these indicated that nitrate input from point and non point sources in the river basin could result in nitrate accumulation and nitrogen pollution in the downstream of the beijiang river basin 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of nitrogen transformations on nitrate flux 4 1 1 nitrate removal processes denitrification and assimilation are the processes of no3 removal the denitrification process is the reduction of no3 to n2o n2 which is recognized as a permanent sink process of no3 hu et al 2020 li et al 2020 thompson et al 2019 by comparison assimilation is the process of no3 or nh4 uptake by phytoplankton and is recognized as a temporary sink process of no3 granger et al 2010 xuan et al 2020b during denitrification or assimilation of no3 microbes preferentially consume light isotopes 14n and 16o resulting in the simultaneous increase in residual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 denk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the denitrification process leads to ratios of increase in the residual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 contents close to 1 5 1 or even 2 1 kendall et al 2007 and the assimilation process lead to an increase in the δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining nitrate close to 1 1 during no3 uptake by phytoplankton granger et al 2004 the data of this study suggested that denitrification and assimilation processes were not obvious throughout the whole watershed first isotopic signatures of the mainstream samples demonstrated that the ratio of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 6 25 for the wet season and 9 09 for the dry season respectively and no significant relationship was observed between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 p 0 05 fig 7 a second the δ15n no3 values increased as no3 n concentrations increased along the beijiang river fig 3 and fig 7b third the do concentrations ranged from 5 23 to 12 5 mg l 1 with an average value of 8 42 1 54 mg l 1 a high do concentration 2 mg l 1 suggested an oxic environment in the beijiang river basin which does not favor microbial removal of no3 by denitrification archana et al 2018 however the lack of isotopic signal for denitrification in this case does not mean that denitrification has not occurred in the river basin in fact denitrification fingerprinting would more obvious where there is an isotopically distinct pool of no3 that was subsequently denitrified in such a river basin the no3 pool represents an open system whereby new no3 is constantly being introduced to the river from a variety of sources during transport thus the isotopic signal resulting from moderate rates of denitrification might be overwhelmed by addition of new nitrate to the stream in addition denitrification could be occur in the sediment or hyporheic zone where would be sub oxic or anoxic even though the water column is well oxygenated childs et al 2002 which would contribute to nitrate removal in a river basin overall in the beijiang river basin the signal of denitrification and assimilation in the river water was weak indicated that the rate of addition of new nitrate to the stream channel exceeded that rate at which nitrate may have been removed due to transformation or sink processes the variabilities in isotopic compositions and nitrate concentrations were influenced by other processes e g nitrification or mixing with additional no3 sources chen et al 2009 ye et al 2016 4 1 2 nitrate production processes nitrification is the oxidation of ammonium compounds into nitrates and nitrites by microbial processes denk et al 2017 mclaughlin et al 2017 and thus nitrification can be recognized as a process of nitrate production xuan et al 2020a in general if nitrification process occurs in the river water the δ15n no3 value would decreases as the no3 n concentration increases casciotti 2016 kendall et al 2007 in the beijiang river no3 n concentrations increased along the river fig 3 which might have been dominated by nitrate production processes or no3 addition from different sources in stream nitrification was excluded as a possible reason for increased no3 according to the following points 1 the δ15n no3 values increased as no3 n concentrations increased along the river fig 3 suggesting that increased no3 was derived from the input of exogenous sources 2 if an in stream nitrification process occurred a negative correlation of no3 n with do concentrations might be observed archana et al 2018 mclaughlin et al 2017 however in this study there was no significant correlation between the no3 n and do concentrations fig 8 a 3 the δ18o no3 value could provide further evidence for the nitrification process in the river during nitrification ammonium is oxidized to nitrate with one third of o atoms derived from atmospheric o2 and two thirds of the o atoms derived from h2o kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 hence the theoretical δ18o no3 value could be calculated using equation 4 4 theoretical î 18 o n o 3 2 3 î 18 o h 2 o 1 3 î 18 o o 2 where δ18o no3 is the theoretical δ18o of no3 derived from nitrification δ18o h2o is the δ18o of river water measured in this study and δ18o o2 is the δ18o of atmospheric o2 considered 23 5 xue et al 2009 however in this study almost all samples had δ18o no3 values below the theoretical line fig 8b in addition there was no significant correlation between δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o values p 0 05 therefore the in stream nitrification process was weak in the beijiang river in general no3 derived from nitrification usually has δ18o no3 values in the range of 10 to 10 which are lower than those resulting from precipitation and fertilizer xue et al 2009 in the beijiang river basin the δ18o no3 values ranged from 3 90 to 7 28 indicating that no3 was derived from microbial nitrification however in stream nitrification was excluded in this study thus microbial nitrification likely has occurred before no3 entered to river water overall the isotopic and chemical compositions suggested that denitrification assimilation and in stream nitrification were weak in the beijiang river indicating that the impacts of n transformations in the river on the removal and production of nitrate were not significant microbial nitrification occurred during the migration of nitrate to rivers therefore the increased no3 n concentrations along the river could be explained by the input of exogenous nitrate sources ogrinc et al 2008 and nitrate flux was affected by different nitrate sources and microbial nitrification 4 1 3 factors affecting nitrogen transformations and nitrate retention our recent studies in highly urbanized watersheds have shown that sewage discharge could promote the nitrification process and repress the removal of no3 by assimilation due to higher nh4 concentrations resulting in the pseudo persistence of no3 in river water xuan et al 2020a in this study the beijiang river basin is a mixed land use watershed and is characterized by a higher percentage of forested and agricultural areas as discussed above the data in this study suggested that denitrification and assimilation were weak in different subcatchment with various land use types this meant that in the study area after nitrate was discharged or released to the rivers either its mainchannel or tributaries in situ nitrogen transformation was not the dominant factor controlling nitrate behaviors this finding was related to the following 1 no3 n was the dominant form of n in the dissolved inorganic nitrogen of nitrate sources fig s2 xuan et al 2019 and 2 the water environment was not favorable for nitrate removal processes e g do concentration 2 mg l 1 archana et al 2018 however microbial nitrification occurred during the migration of nitrate and before entering river water which resulted in nitrate retention in the watershed billy et al 2010 lorenz and lal 2009 mcphillips et al 2015 the data of our two studies indicated that the mechanisms of nitrate retention affected by n transformations were different between urbanized and forested or agricultural watersheds and thus the management of nitrate pollution should differ in highly urbanized watersheds sewage source reductions should be mainly considered in the management of nitrate pollution the reasons are that 1 sewage is a direct discharge to the river and therefore more straightforward to address from an engineering and cost standpoint 2 sewage is the main substrate for n transformation and therefore more beneficial to removal of nitrate through reducing nitrification and assimilation of nh4 3 controlling sewage discharge has been success for declining nitrogen loads to the estuary in some rivers such as the chesapeake bay in the united states ator et al 2019 by contrast in agricultural or forested watersheds considering fertilizer and soil as the largest nitrate contributors to the river development of better fertilization practices and agricultural extension to control release fertilizers and soil erosion yang et al 2016 4 2 factors affecting source apportionment of nitrate 4 2 1 runoff as discussed above source apportionment of nitrate is crucial to the management of nitrate pollution in the beijiang river runoff is the driving force for terrestrial source discharge into the river water ohte et al 2004 yu et al 2015 and thus runoff might affect the source apportionment of nitrate in this study the monthly variation in the source apportionment pattern of no3 was not significant p 0 05 the proportional contributions of different no3 sources were similar between the dry season and wet season during the dry season the proportional contributions from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were 49 19 and 32 respectively during the wet season the proportional contributions from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were 51 17 and 32 respectively in addition there were no significant correlations between monthly runoff and proportional contributions of different no3 sources p 0 05 fig 9 these findings suggested that monthly changes in runoff were not the major factor controlling the source distribution of no3 in the beijiang river basin however the small effect of runoff on the source apportionment of no3 did not indicate a minor influence of runoff on the flux of nitrogen from different nitrate sources according to the calculation during the wet season the fluxes of no3 n from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were 3 56 104 tons 1 28 104 tons and 2 28 104 tons respectively during the dry season the fluxes of no3 n from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were 1 10 104 tons 0 43 104 tons and 0 72 104 tons respectively these results suggested that increased runoff would increase the fluxes of nitrate sources 4 2 2 land use land use is the original factor affecting the spatial variation in source apportionments of no3 among regions the different types of land use could affect the characteristics of aquatic ecosystems such as water quality nutrient loading and source distribution of nitrate tromboni and dodds 2017 zorzal almeida et al 2018 in the beijiang river basin the area percentages of different land uses and land use index values showed spatial variations table 1 in addition the proportional contributions of no3 sources showed a significant spatial variation fig 4d which indicated that land use might be considered an important factor affecting no3 source apportionment previous studies have shown that the δ15n no3 value increased and displayed a higher proportion of domestic sewage contributing to nitrate in the river water as urbanization or population density increased archana et al 2018 liu et al 2018 xuan et al 2019 yi et al 2020 furthermore the δ15n no3 value decreased and the proportional contribution of fertilizer increased in agricultural areas han et al 2018 lu et al 2015 however in a catchment with mixed land uses the effect of land use on the no3 source distribution is more complex indexes that summarize many variables with a single number or classification are recognized as useful tools for watershed management zorzal almeida et al 2018 in this study the lui was proposed to evaluate the integrated effect of land use on no3 source apportionment in the beijiang river basin the lui was significantly correlated with the proportional contributions of synthetic fertilizer soil nitrogen and domestic sewage to nitrate fig 10 indicating the importance of land use to no3 source apportionment meghdadi and javar 2018 a significant negative correlation was observed between the lui and proportional contributions of synthetic fertilizer fig 10a however significant positive correlations were found between the lui and proportional contributions of soil nitrogen as well as proportional contributions of domestic sewage fig 10b and fig 10c these relationships suggested that the impacts of human activities on nitrate flux changed as the lui increased 1 an increased urbanized area resulted in an increase in point sources domestic sewage and a decrease in nonpoint sources synthetic fertilizer 2 intense human activities might increase soil erosion xia et al 2017 and subsequently increase the proportion of soil nitrogen contributing to nitrate in river water this finding indicated that land use determined the level of no3 and the increased no3 concentration was the result of exogenous sources from human activities therefore in a catchment located in an urban and rural interaction zone reduced point pollution such as domestic sewage should be considered the primary action in the nitrate pollution management of river water and the lui could be used as an index to assess the effects of land use on nitrate pollution sources zorzal almeida et al 2018 4 3 effects of land use on nitrate and isotopes as discussed above land use is an important factor affecting nitrate flux hence the effects of different land uses on nitrate variables are expected to be detectable tromboni and dodds 2017 zorzal almeida et al 2018 correlation coefficients between different land uses expressed in percent and variables related to nitrate no3 n concentrations δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were calculated in the beijiang river basin fig 11 for the no3 n concentration urban land use was the dominant factor affecting its variations a significant positive correlation was observed between the percentage of urban area and no3 n concentration indicating that no3 pollution from urbanized areas was the dominant contributor to the increased no3 n concentration in the river water in addition the effect of urbanized area on increased no3 n concentration was similar in wet and dry seasons fig 11 this finding suggested that no3 pollution from urbanized areas could be considered a point source which would not be affected by variability in seasonal runoff hale et al 2014 however it is notable that the relative contribution of a point source could typically diminish as river runoff increases for the nitrogen isotope of nitrate the change in its values was affected by multiple land uses the δ15n no3 values were significantly positively correlated with the percentages of urban water and agricultural areas fig 11 indicating that no3 pollution from these areas was characterized by higher δ15n no3 values such as those from domestic sewage and livestock manure choi et al 2017 however the δ15n no3 value was significantly negatively correlated with the proportion of forested areas fig 11 in contrast to the urbanized and agricultural areas the no3 source from the forested area did not record the isotopic composition of the anthropogenic nitrate sources and the majority of the no3 of the forest area originated soil nitrogen with a lower δ15n no3 value barnes and raymond 2010 thus the relatively depleted δ15n no3 signal 1 19 to 5 in the watershed might be related to the high percentage of forest area and soil erosion in addition compared with other studies table s2 it was found that the δ15n no3 values in the beijiang river basin were lower than those in urbanized watersheds archana et al 2018 jani and toor 2018 liu et al 2018 wiegner et al 2016 yi et al 2020 and higher than that in the agricultural watersheds han et al 2018 luu et al 2020 this finding provided further evidence of the effects of different land uses on the nitrogen isotopes of nitrate for the oxygen isotope of nitrate the effect of land use on its variation was more pronounced in june and july fig 11 the δ18o no3 values were significantly negatively correlated with the percentages of grass and bush fallow areas this finding suggested that the δ18o no3 value was mainly related to microbial nitrification but not nitrogen sources barnes and raymond 2010 in general microbial nitrification has occurred in soils before nitrate entered to the watersheds and thus had lower δ18o no3 values 10 to 10 xue et al 2009 in june and july nitrate sources from grass and bush fallow areas into the watersheds increased due to high runoff rates leading to a decrease in the δ18o no3 value compared with other studies table s2 it was found that the δ18o no3 values in the beijiang river basin were higher than those in the forested and cultivated watersheds li et al 2019 luu et al 2020 but much lower than those in the urbanized watersheds archana et al 2018 jani and toor 2018 this finding provided further evidence that microbial nitrification was more likely to occur in forested and cultivated lands and resulted in depletions in δ18o no3 values therefore the effect of land use on the δ18o no3 value was mainly reflected in the potential of nitrification across different land uses 4 4 factor affecting nitrate flux and implications to nitrate pollution control as discussed above no3 n concentrations showed a little higher in the dry season than that in the wet season in the beijiang river basin which indicated that runoff could dilute no3 n concentrations however no3 n flux was higher in the wet season 7 10 104 tons than that in the dry season 2 27 104 tons which suggested that the nitrate flux depended on runoff in addition both the no3 n concentration and no3 n flux showed an increase trend from upstream to downstream indicating that nitrate accumulated in the downstream of the river basin the isotopic signals of nitrate removal and production processes in the beijiang river basin were weak which means the signal might be overwhelmed by addition of new nitrate to the rivers therefore in this study the major factor affecting distributions of no3 n concentrations and nitrate accumulation was exogenous sources input rather than n transformations in the river our results suggested that the imminent focus of nitrate pollution control in such a river basin should lie in the reduction of exogenous sources input exogenous discharge was directly related to the land use which determined the pattern of nitrate flux and nitrate pollution in the agricultural area fertilizer and related agricultural wastewater was the dominant nitrate source previous studies have revealed that most of farmers in china had a lack of training in fertilizer applications and a decline in applying organic fertilizers yang and fang 2015 thus development of agricultural training programs for encouraging better fertilization practices should be put in the top priority for reducing agricultural nitrate source discharged to the river in rural area in china and possibly many other regions worldwide yang et al 2016 in the urbanized area domestic sewage discharge was the dominant reason for nitrate accumulation and nitrate pollution in the rivers despite the recent developments in wastewater treatment technologies controlling sewage discharge remains more straightforward to address from an engineering and cost standpoint controlling sewage discharge is also the principal reason why nitrate loads to the downstream or estuary have been declining ator et al 2019 and therefore sewage source prevention should be a prior consideration in the management of nitrate pollution in the urbanized regions 5 conclusions knowledge of the source distribution and transformations of nitrate could provide a scientific basis for nitrate pollution management in river ecosystems in this study a dual isotope approach δ15n and δ18o was applied to identify sources and transformations of nitrate and investigate the impacts of land use and runoff on nitrate flux in a mixed land use basin the beijiang river basin the results revealed that the no3 n flux of the beijiang river basin was 9 37 104 tons in 2015 and the no3 n concentration increased along the river the data indicated that the increased no3 n concentration and nitrate accumulation in the downstream was mainly caused by inputs of exogenous nitrate sources rather than contributions of n transformations in the river this finding was different from the highly urbanized watershed in which n transformations resulted in nitrate accumulation thus reducing inputs of exogenous nitrate sources to river water was the primary action to reduce nitrate pollution in the mixed land use watershed in addition land use was recognized as the major factor affecting the source distributions of no3 n concentrations in the beijiang river basin the no3 n concentration increased significantly as the area percentage of urbanized land use increased indicating that the effect of land use on nitrate pollution was more significant in urbanized areas this study has the potential to add to knowledge of nitrate isotope patterns in mixed land use watersheds and has proved isotope values to be a useful tool for discriminating the sources of nitrate however isotope investigations such as this also has limitations because nitrate is constantly added to downstream from various sources in an open system and isotopic signal of nitrate transformed by biogeochemical processes might be overwhelmed by addition of new nitrate to the stream in the future the combination of isotope investigations with tracing techniques of 15n isotope as well as complex mechanistic models could provide better understanding of the impacts of nitrate

3827,river nitrate no3 pollution is ubiquitous and has attracted worldwide attention the continuous increase nitrate flux in the river system is mainly caused by inputs of exogenous nitrate sources or nitrogen transformations in this study coupled nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate were used to identify sources and transformations of nitrate in a mixed land use watershed of southern china the beijiang river basin aimed at evaluating the impacts of sources or transformations on nitrate pollution and provide guidance for aquatic environment management the results showed that the no3 n flux in the beijiang river basin was 9 37 104 tons in 2015 isotopic evidence indicated that the impacts of nitrogen transformations in the river on the removal and production of nitrate were not significant and the increased no3 n concentration along the river was caused by inputs of exogenous nitrate sources the isotope based source apportionment revealed that approximately 52 of the influx no3 n was contributed by synthetic fertilizer 27 by soil nitrogen and 21 by domestic sewage there was no significant temporal variations in source apportionment however significant spatial variations were found across the study area the spatial variations were mainly affected by the different land use patterns with the increasing percentage of urbanized areas the proportional contributions of domestic sewage have increased which has resulted in an increased no3 n concentration in addition the relationships between the land use index and proportional contributions of different nitrate sources suggested that the effect of urbanized area might be more pronounced on nitrate pollution in a mixed land use watershed therefore the results of this study suggested that land use should be considered in nitrate pollution management strategies and reducing inputs of nitrate sources to river water is crucial to reducing nitrate pollution in mixed land use watersheds keywords nitrate source apportionment transformation land use 1 introduction intensive human activities have greatly altered the global nitrogen n cycle resulting in increased amounts of reactive n in the atmosphere landscape and water boyer et al 2006 fowler et al 2013 the global n delivery to rivers and streams increased from 34 tg n yr 1 to 64 tg n yr 1 over the 20th century beusen et al 2016 of all nitrogen species nitrate nitrogen no3 n is dominant and its concentrations in rivers have risen above acceptable levels 10 mg l 1 in many areas of the world kendall et al 2007 for example in china approximately 7 83 of surface water bodies that have an average no3 n concentration above the 10 mg l 1 over the last 8 years zhang et al 2020 high concentrations of no3 n in rivers can pose serious threats to local aquatic ecosystems e g eutrophication and can cause sanitary problems associated with drinking water briand et al 2017 kendall et al 2007 therefore tracing the cause of the increased nitrate concentration and flux in rivers is crucial for water quality management and has important implications for regional and global n cycling the increased no3 n concentration in river water originates from 1 inputs of exogenous nitrate sources and 2 contributions of n transformations in river systems xuan et al 2020a terrestrial nitrate sources are typically classified as point and nonpoint sources ongley et al 2010 yi et al 2020 the point sources of nitrate mainly originate from the discharge of domestic sewage and agricultural or industrial wastewater cejudo et al 2018 popescu et al 2015 xuan et al 2019 the nonpoint sources of nitrate enter rivers in a diffused manner and mainly include soil nitrogen atmospheric deposition agricultural fertilizer and livestock manure inácio et al 2015 lu et al 2015 yue et al 2014 previous studies have suggested that point sources are the dominant nitrate source in urbanized areas archana et al 2016 liu et al 2018 xuan et al 2020a while nonpoint sources are the major nitrate sources in agricultural areas han et al 2018 ongley et al 2010 however in recent years urban land use has increased followed by increased point sources in agricultural watersheds due to the development of urbanization and an increasing population xuan et al 2019 this has resulted in mixed land uses and highly complex source distributions of nitrate therefore the estimation of nitrate source apportionment in a mixed land use watershed could provide further information on nitrate pollution in developing regions exogenous nitrate source input is the primary driver of increased nitrate concentrations because all nitrate originates from an exogenous source unless nitrate is generated naturally through n fixation at a site the exogenous nitrate source is later transformed by biogeochemical processes in the river ecosystem which would resulted in increased nitrate concentrations in the rivers thus n transformation plays a nonnegligible role in nitrate accumulations in river ecosystems mclaughlin et al 2017 xuan et al 2020a n transformations in river ecosystems can be classified into nitrate removal and production processes denitrification and assimilation are typical nitrate removal processes however nitrification is a process of nitrate production denk et al 2017 our previous study in an urbanized watershed suggested that sewage with a high concentration of ammonia nh4 could promote nitrification and repress the removal of no3 by assimilation which resulted in nitrate accumulation in the river ecosystem xuan et al 2020a however in a mixed land use watershed that is characterized by a lower nh4 concentration how n transformations affect nitrate concentrations and nitrate flux in the river still needs to be elucidated therefore for water environment management at the basin scale it is essential to determine nitrate sources identify the transformations of n and investigate the impacts of nitrate sources and n transformations on nitrate flux in mixed land use watersheds source contributions and transformations of nitrate are impacted by changes in land use and runoff land use is recognized as the original factor affecting source contributions in general increasing forest or agricultural areas leads to increased nonpoint sources lin et al 2015 and urbanization often results in increased point sources bu et al 2014 runoff is the driving force for nitrate discharge into river water and exhibits a significant control on the migration distribution and transformation of nitrate xuan et al 2020b for example increased runoff leads to increased erosive processes which results in increased contributions of nonpoint sources to river water during the wet season li et al 2019a xuan et al 2019 in addition compared with the dry season biogeochemical processes in rivers are weak during the wet season because of the increased runoff rates xuan et al 2020a compared with traditional static environmental management dynamic water environmental management needs to be carried out on the basis of the dynamic characteristics of river hydrology and pollution source discharge however on the watershed scale a complex mix of land uses result in a complex mix of pollutant sources that include both point and nonpoint sources it is difficult to carry out quantitative source analysis work which makes it impossible to perform targeted water environmental management work therefore to improve surface water quality and watershed management it is important to understand the characteristics of temporal and spatial variations in no3 source apportionments and impacts of land use and runoff on the origin distribution and fate of nitrate in river ecosystems the recognition of sources and transformations of nitrate at different temporal and spatial scales is a challenge for river ecosystem studies among many methods stable nitrogen isotope δ15n combined with oxygen isotope δ18o offer a direct means of source identification and can be used to describe the biogeochemical processes of nitrate denk et al 2017 jani and toor 2018 kendall et al 2007 kruk et al 2020 luu et al 2020 meghdadi and javar 2018 yi et al 2020 different sources of nitrate often have distinct isotopic signatures for example synthetic fertilizer generally exhibits depleted δ15n values 5 9 to 1 9 relative to livestock manure 4 9 to 20 9 or domestic sewage 4 to 19 choi et al 2017 xue et al 2009 the δ18o values of atmospheric no3 are generally higher 25 to 75 than those of other sources 25 casciotti et al 2010 xue et al 2009 in addition biological processes of n often change isotopic ratios in predictable and recognizable directions that can leave distinguishable signatures on the isotopic composition of nitrate for example the denitrification process leads to the simultaneous increase in residual δ15n and δ18o in nitrate and the ratios are assumed to be close to 1 5 1 or even 2 1 denk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 however the assimilation process can result in an increase in the δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining nitrate close to 1 1 during no3 uptake by phytoplankton granger et al 2004 therefore in this study dual isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were measured in monthly river water samples in a mixed land use river basin to quantify source apportionments and to identify n transformations the beijiang river basin has a typical subtropical monsoon climate and is characterized by warm and humid summer monsoons as well as cool and dry winter monsoons resulting in high seasonal variation in runoff seasonal changes in runoff might affect source apportionment and nitrate pollution thus monthly research was conducted in this study in addition the beijiang river basin is a typical mixed land use watershed with high proportions of forest and agricultural land during the last two decades the region in the beijiang river basin has experienced explosive economic growth leading to increased urbanized land areas and human activities li et al 2019b xuan et al 2019 land use changes are the main factors that alter riverine n origins although previous studies have shown that nitrate sources have spatial variability chen et al 2009 xuan et al 2019 few studies have focused on the impacts of different land uses on nitrate sources and nitrate pollution therefore in this study the spatio temporal variations in nitrate sources and transformations were identified based on coupled nitrogen and oxygen isotopes of nitrate over one hydrological year in the beijiang river basin the objective of this study was to reveal whether nitrate pollution was caused by exogenous input or n transformations in a mixed land use watershed and investigate the factors affecting spatial temporal variations in nitrate pollution specifically the study 1 identified n transformations and discussed the impacts of n transformations on nitrate flux 2 quantified nitrate source apportionment and discussed factors affecting its temporal and spatial variations and 3 established relationships between land use and nitrate isotopes and investigated the impacts of land use on nitrate pollution the novel aspect of this study is to reveal quantitatively the relationship between land use and nitrate of the river water which would provide some new insights to spatial patterns of nitrate in the river water 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the beijiang river is the second largest tributary of the pearl river and is located in southeastern china fig 1 the beijiang river basin covers an area of 52 068 km2 and has a total length of 573 km cao et al 2020 in the river basin the annual mean temperature ranges between 14 and 22 c and the annual mean precipitation ranges between 1390 and 2475 mm li et al 2019b luo et al 2008 the river basin is located in a subtropical monsoon climate zone and is characterized by warm and humid summer monsoons as well as cool and dry winter monsoons xuan et al 2019 resulting in highly seasonal variations in runoff and nutrient loads the annual mean runoff of the river basin is 4 3 billion m3 with 70 to 80 of the flux occurring in the wet season according to runoff data from the guangdong water resources bulletin http www pearlwater gov cn covering a period of 65 years 1951 2015 the flood period is concentrated in the wet season april to september while the lowest runoff occurs in the dry season october to march the beijiang river basin is a mixed land use watershed with a high proportion of areas containing forests and agricultural lands fig 1 since the reform and opening up of chinese economic policies lin 2014 the region has experienced explosive economic growth over the last 20 years resulting in increased urbanized areas and populations the percentages of forested agricultural and urbanized lands within the beijiang river basin were 74 3 19 2 and 1 3 respectively in the 1980 s xuan et al 2019 in 2015 the percentages of forest and agricultural areas decreased to 72 4 and 18 7 respectively and the percentage of urbanized area increased to 3 0 fig 1 in addition according to data from the guangdong statistical yearbook http stats gd gov cn gdtjnj index html the chemical fertilizer application in the beijiang river basin is estimated to be approximate 4 16 104 ton in 1990 11 21 104 ton in 2005 and 6 40 104 ton in 2015 therefore the effects of different land uses on nutrient loads might change and high loads of anthropogenic nutrients would have profound effects on the source distribution and transformations of nitrogen 2 2 sampling collection in this study river water samples were collected at 15 hydrological stations table s1 in the beijiang river basin on the first day of every month in 2015 fig 1 at each sampling site surface water samples 0 5 m below the air water interface were collected with a portable water sampler all water samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm glass fiber filter and stored in

mainstream domestic sewage samples n 5 were collected from the sewage outlet 2 3 analysis method field parameters for the river water samples including temperature t ph electric conductivity ec and dissolved oxygen do concentration were measured in situ using portable multiparameter equipment ysi exo2 xylem brand usa that was calibrated before measurements were taken the concentrations of nitrate n no3 n were analyzed by a continuous flow injection analyzer ams alliance integral futura frepillon france with a detection limit of 0 02 mg l 1 the nitrogen n and oxygen o isotopes of nitrate δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were analyzed using the bacterial denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 sigman et al 2001 briefly the no3 of the river water was converted to n2o by denitrifying bacteria that lack n2o reductase activity the cells of denitrifying bacteria were concentrated 4 5 fold and then transferred into 10 ml headspace vials the vials were purged with high purity n2 for at least 3 h to ensure anaerobic conditions a sample amount of 60 nmol no3 n was injected into the vials and then cultured to convert no3 to n2o then n2o was extracted and purified through a precon system thermo fisher and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were analyzed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer delta advantage v thermo fisher the δ15n and δ18o measurement systems were calibrated with the international reference standards of iaea n3 4 7 0 2 for δ15n and 25 6 0 4 for δ18o usgs34 1 8 0 2 for δ15n and 27 9 0 4 for δ18o and usgs35 2 7 0 2 for δ15n and 57 5 0 3 for δ18o the analytical precisions for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were 0 4 and 0 5 respectively in addition to investigate the nitrification of nitrate the o isotope of river water δ18o h2o was analyzed the δ18o h2o values were analyzed using a high precision laser isotope analyzer picarro l2130i with an analytical precision of 0 01 soil samples were freeze dried at 80 c for 72 h the dried samples were then ground in an agate grinder and sieved through a 0 149 mm mesh for further analysis prior to analysis of the contents and isotopes of c any possible inorganic carbonates were removed from the samples by acidification with 0 5 mol l 1 hcl and the samples was then rinsed with deionized water until the filtrate ph was neutral yamamuro and kayanne 1995 stable nitrogen isotopic analysis of soil samples was measured using an elemental analyzer flash ea2000 thermo fisher and a mass spectrometer delta advantage v thermo fisher the analytical precision of δ15n was 0 2 2 4 calculations and statistical analysis 2 4 1 land use index lui calculation to statistically correlate variables and source apportionments of nitrate with land use a landscape metric referred to as the land use index lui was developed ometo et al 2000 this index is the sum of land use percentages weighted by the following values natural areas including forest bush fallow wetland and water 0 grass areas 0 2 agricultural areas 0 5 and urbanized areas 5 the weight of each land use type was given based on two criteria 1 the effect of land use on nitrate pollution and 2 the effect of land use on nitrogen isotopes and which was obtained from the literatures ometo et al 2000 zorzal almeida et al 2018 fifteen nested subcatchments were divided based on the 15 sampling sites and selected raster digital elevation model dem using the hydrological analysis module of arcgis 10 2 fig s1 the extraction of the watershed was based on a dem with a 30 m resolution the different land use percentages of each catchment were calculated by the hydrological module in arcgis 10 2 based on a land use map provided by the national earth system science data sharing infrastructure national science technology infrastructure of china http www geodata cn the results of the extraction of subwatersheds are presented in fig s1 the results of land use percentages and lui values for the 15 nested subcatchments are presented in table 1 2 4 2 source apportionments calculation to quantify the contributions of different sources to nitrate in river water a bayesian stable isotope mixing model stable isotopic analysis in r siar was used based on the n and o isotopes of nitrate parnell and jackson 2010 semmens et al 2009 the siar mixing model can be expressed as follows x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 1 ε jk n 0 σ j 2 where xij is the isotope value j of the mixture i in which i 1 2 3 i and j 1 2 3 j sjk is the source value k on isotope j k 1 2 3 k and is normally distributed with mean μjk and standard deviation ωjk pk is the proportion of source k which needs to be estimated by siar model cjk is the fractionation factor for isotope j on source k and is normally distributed with

no3 j 2 and three potential sources synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were considered the end members of different sources in this study were determined by measured values or selected by referring to the data obtained from commonly used sources table 2 the end member value of δ15n no3 from synthetic fertilizer 1 2 0 4 was obtained from the literature choi et al 2017 the end members of δ15n no3 for domestic sewage 15 8 0 8 and soil nitrogen 9 6 2 2 were determined based on 5 domestic sewage samples and 22 soil samples respectively distributed along the river the end members of δ18o no3 for synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were designated as having the same value 2 9 0 6 yi et al 2020 the nitrate from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen experienced microbial processes all of which had typical δ18o no3 values and were different from the δ18o values in atmospheric deposited sources xue et al 2009 the fractionation factors for all sources were set to zero cjk 0 in eq 1 because corresponding experiments for determining enrichment factors were not conducted and no significant isotope fraction signals were observed in this study 2 4 3 runoff data collection and nitrate flux calculation monthly river runoff in 2015 was obtained from 15 hydrological monitoring stations 15 sampling sites the monthly no3 n flux f m and annual no3 n flux f a was estimated using the monthly average no3 n concentration c m and monthly runoff q m at each hydrological stations as follows 2 f m c m q m t m 10 6 3 f a m 1 m c m q m t m 10 6 where q m m3 s 1 is the monthly average runoff at each hydrological station in which m 1 2 3 12 c m mg l 1 is the no3 n concentration of samples collected every month at each sampling site which is regarded as the average no3 n concentration for every month t m s is the time of every month f m ton month 1 is the monthly no3 n flux at each sampling site f m ton year 1 is the annual no3 n flux at each sampling site the sj station is located at the river mouth of the beijiang river and thus the calculated no3 n flux of the sj station represents the no3 n flux of the whole river basin 2 4 4 statistical analysis all statistical tests were conducted using spss version 22 0 analysis of variance anova was used to test the temporal and spatial variations in no3 n concentrations and δ15n no3

monthly averaged runoff at the outlets sj station of the beijiang river basin ranged from 359 to 4950 m3 s 1 peak runoff occurred in may 4950 m3 s 1 and june 2610 m3 s 1 and low runoff occurred in february 359 m3 s 1 and january 445 m3 s 1 fig 2 concurrent with the runoff the physiochemical parameters demonstrated seasonal variability fig 2 the water temperatures at all sampling sites ranged

μs cm 1 3 2 temporal and spatial variations in nitrate concentrations and isotopic signatures the no3 n concentrations at all sampling sites ranged from 0 08 to 3 51 mg l 1 with an average value of 1 14 0 68 mg l 1 the two way anova showed that the spatial difference in the no3 n concentration was significant p 0 01 table 3 the monthly averaged no3 n concentration was the highest at the wj hydrological station 2 43 0 66 mg l 1 and was the lowest at the hjt hydrological station 0 30 0 18 mg l 1 table 3 in addition the no3 n concentration showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream in the mainstream of the beijiang river fig 3 a the no3 n concentrations was higher in the urbanized and agricultural areas than that in the forest areas fig 4 which indicated that the increases of nitrate concentration in the rivers might be contributed to human activities in terms of the whole river basin the two way anova showed a temporal varation in the no3 n concentration between wet and dry seasons p 0 05 table 3 for each of the sampling points the one way anova showed that there was a temporal change of no3 n concentration only at the sampling points of yd jlw and wj stations and that was higher in the dry season table 3 the overall δ15n no3 values varied from 1 19 to 12 60 with an average value of 5 07 3 21 the two way anova showed that the spatial difference in the δ15n no3 value was significant p 0 01 table 3 the δ15n no3 values showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream in the mainstream of the beijiang river fig 3c in the tributary the monthly averaged δ15n no3 value was lowest at the jlw hydrological station 1 16 0 01 which was located upstream of the beijiang river basin in addition the monthly averaged δ15n no3 value was higher at the wj hydrological station 8 69 2 17 sj hydrological station 8 67 1 33 and flx hydrological station 7 48 0 73 where the dominant land use was urban table 3 and fig 4 which indicated that domestic sewage which was characterized by higher δ15n no3 signature might be the dominant nitrate source the two way anova showed that there was no temporal varation in the δ15n no3 value between wet and dry seasons p 0 05 table 3 for each of the sampling points a significant temporal variation in the δ15n no3 value was only found at the sampling point of sj station by the one way anova table 3 the δ15n no3 values of samples from the sj station were higher in the dry season 9 77 0 46 than that in the wet season 7 57 0 88 the overall δ18o no3 values ranged from 3 90 to 7 28 with an average value of 1 33 1

mainstream of the beijiang river fig 3d with higher monthly averaged value at the sj hydrological station 2 70 0 83 and flx hydrological station 2 30 0 72 table 3 in addition in the tributary the δ18o no3 values were also higher at the gd hydrological station 2 98 1 46 table 3 the higher δ18o no3 values were shown in the downstream of the river where is located in the urbanized area fig 4 which might be related to human activities the two way anova showed that there was no temporal varation in the δ18o no3 value between wet and dry seasons p 0 05 table 3 for each of the sampling points a significant temporal variation in the δ18o no3 value was only found at the sampling point of sk station by the one way anova table 3 the δ18o no3 values of samples from the sk station were higher in the wet season 1 53 0 0 30 than that in the dry season 0 94 0 33 3 3 proportional contributions of different nitrate sources the source plot for the dual isotopic values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 showed that nitrate in the beijiang river basin mainly originated from sources of synthetic fertilizer sewage manure and soil nitrogen fig 5 the source apportionment of no3 seems to be related to land use most of the samples with higher lui values 20 fell within the range of the sewage manure zone however most of the samples with lower lui values 20 fell within the synthetic fertilizer and soil nitrogen zones fig 5a and c both the plot of δ15n no3 with δ18o no3 and the plot of no3 cl ratios with cl molar concentrations suggested that most of samples from main stream mainly originated from sewage manure source while most of samples of tributary mainly originated from agricultural fertilizer source fig 5a and fig 5c in addition the distribution of no3 sources seemed to be less related to seasonal changes fig 5b and 5d the siar mixing model outputs of the no3 proportional contributions are presented in fig 6 overall in the beijiang river basin synthetic fertilizer was the predominant no3 source mean probability estimate mpe of 52 soil nitrogen was the second no3 contributor mpe of 27 and domestic sewage contributed the least mpe of 21 in addition the one way anova showed that the no3 source apportionment pattern had a significant spatial variation p 0 01 but no significant temporal variation p 0 05 among all the hydrological stations the proportional contribution of synthetic fertilizer demonstrated the highest value at the jlw station mpe of 98 5 and the lowest values at the wj and sj stations mpe of 28 in contrast the proportional contributions of soil nitrogen and domestic sewage were lowest at the jlw station mpe of 1 and 0 5 respectivly however at the wj and sj stations the proportional contributions of soil nitrogen were higher with monthly averaged of 38 and 37 respectively additionally the proportional contributions of domestic sewage were higher at the flx wj and sj stations mpe of 35 34 and 34 respectively 3 4 nitrate flux based on the data of the sj station which is located at the river mouth of the beijiang river the no3 n flux for the whole river basin was 9 37 104 tons during the hydrological year of 2015 with 76 of the no3 n flux being produced in the wet season in addition the no3 n flux showed an increasing trend from upstream to downstream in the mainstream of the beijiang river and this trend was consistent with that of the no3 n concentration fig 3 based on the proportional contributions of different nitrate sources at the sj station in the downstream of the beijiang river basin the no3 n fluxes from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were estimated to be 2 66 104 tons 3 22 104 tons and 3 49 104 tons respectively these indicated that nitrate input from point and non point sources in the river basin could result in nitrate accumulation and nitrogen pollution in the downstream of the beijiang river basin 4 discussion 4 1 impacts of nitrogen transformations on nitrate flux 4 1 1 nitrate removal processes denitrification and assimilation are the processes of no3 removal the denitrification process is the reduction of no3 to n2o n2 which is recognized as a permanent sink process of no3 hu et al 2020 li et al 2020 thompson et al 2019 by comparison assimilation is the process of no3 or nh4 uptake by phytoplankton and is recognized as a temporary sink process of no3 granger et al 2010 xuan et al 2020b during denitrification or assimilation of no3 microbes preferentially consume light isotopes 14n and 16o resulting in the simultaneous increase in residual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 denk et al 2017 nikolenko et al 2018 previous studies have shown that the denitrification process leads to ratios of increase in the residual δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 contents close to 1 5 1 or even 2 1 kendall et al 2007 and the assimilation process lead to an increase in the δ15n and δ18o values of the remaining nitrate close to 1 1 during no3 uptake by phytoplankton granger et al 2004 the data of this study suggested that denitrification and assimilation processes were not obvious throughout the whole watershed first isotopic signatures of the mainstream samples demonstrated that the ratio of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 was 6 25 for the wet season and 9 09 for the dry season respectively and no significant relationship was observed between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 p 0 05 fig 7 a second the δ15n no3 values increased as no3 n concentrations increased along the beijiang river fig 3 and fig 7b third the do concentrations ranged from 5 23 to 12 5 mg l 1 with an average value of 8 42 1 54 mg l 1 a high do concentration 2 mg l 1 suggested an oxic environment in the beijiang river basin which does not favor microbial removal of no3 by denitrification archana et al 2018 however the lack of isotopic signal for denitrification in this case does not mean that denitrification has not occurred in the river basin in fact denitrification fingerprinting would more obvious where there is an isotopically distinct pool of no3 that was subsequently denitrified in such a river basin the no3 pool represents an open system whereby new no3 is constantly being introduced to the river from a variety of sources during transport thus the isotopic signal resulting from moderate rates of denitrification might be overwhelmed by addition of new nitrate to the stream in addition denitrification could be occur in the sediment or hyporheic zone where would be sub oxic or anoxic even though the water column is well oxygenated childs et al 2002 which would contribute to nitrate removal in a river basin overall in the beijiang river basin the signal of denitrification and assimilation in the river water was weak indicated that the rate of addition of new nitrate to the stream channel exceeded that rate at which nitrate may have been removed due to transformation or sink processes the variabilities in isotopic compositions and nitrate concentrations were influenced by other processes e g nitrification or mixing with additional no3 sources chen et al 2009 ye et al 2016 4 1 2 nitrate production processes nitrification is the oxidation of ammonium compounds into nitrates and nitrites by microbial processes denk et al 2017 mclaughlin et al 2017 and thus nitrification can be recognized as a process of nitrate production xuan et al 2020a in general if nitrification process occurs in the river water the δ15n no3 value would decreases as the no3 n concentration increases casciotti 2016 kendall et al 2007 in the beijiang river no3 n concentrations increased along the river fig 3 which might have been dominated by nitrate production processes or no3 addition from different sources in stream nitrification was excluded as a possible reason for increased no3 according to the following points 1 the δ15n no3 values increased as no3 n concentrations increased along the river fig 3 suggesting that increased no3 was derived from the input of exogenous sources 2 if an in stream nitrification process occurred a negative correlation of no3 n with do concentrations might be observed archana et al 2018 mclaughlin et al 2017 however in this study there was no significant correlation between the no3 n and do concentrations fig 8 a 3 the δ18o no3 value could provide further evidence for the nitrification process in the river during nitrification ammonium is oxidized to nitrate with one third of o atoms derived from atmospheric o2 and two thirds of the o atoms derived from h2o kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2009 hence the theoretical δ18o no3 value could be calculated using equation 4 4 theoretical î 18 o n o 3 2 3 î 18 o h 2 o 1 3 î 18 o o 2 where δ18o no3 is the theoretical δ18o of no3 derived from nitrification δ18o h2o is the δ18o of river water measured in this study and δ18o o2 is the δ18o of atmospheric o2 considered 23 5 xue et al 2009 however in this study almost all samples had δ18o no3 values below the theoretical line fig 8b in addition there was no significant correlation between δ18o no3 and δ18o h2o values p 0 05 therefore the in stream nitrification process was weak in the beijiang river in general no3 derived from nitrification usually has δ18o no3 values in the range of 10 to 10 which are lower than those resulting from precipitation and fertilizer xue et al 2009 in the beijiang river basin the δ18o no3 values ranged from 3 90 to 7 28 indicating that no3 was derived from microbial nitrification however in stream nitrification was excluded in this study thus microbial nitrification likely has occurred before no3 entered to river water overall the isotopic and chemical compositions suggested that denitrification assimilation and in stream nitrification were weak in the beijiang river indicating that the impacts of n transformations in the river on the removal and production of nitrate were not significant microbial nitrification occurred during the migration of nitrate to rivers therefore the increased no3 n concentrations along the river could be explained by the input of exogenous nitrate sources ogrinc et al 2008 and nitrate flux was affected by different nitrate sources and microbial nitrification 4 1 3 factors affecting nitrogen transformations and nitrate retention our recent studies in highly urbanized watersheds have shown that sewage discharge could promote the nitrification process and repress the removal of no3 by assimilation due to higher nh4 concentrations resulting in the pseudo persistence of no3 in river water xuan et al 2020a in this study the beijiang river basin is a mixed land use watershed and is characterized by a higher percentage of forested and agricultural areas as discussed above the data in this study suggested that denitrification and assimilation were weak in different subcatchment with various land use types this meant that in the study area after nitrate was discharged or released to the rivers either its mainchannel or tributaries in situ nitrogen transformation was not the dominant factor controlling nitrate behaviors this finding was related to the following 1 no3 n was the dominant form of n in the dissolved inorganic nitrogen of nitrate sources fig s2 xuan et al 2019 and 2 the water environment was not favorable for nitrate removal processes e g do concentration 2 mg l 1 archana et al 2018 however microbial nitrification occurred during the migration of nitrate and before entering river water which resulted in nitrate retention in the watershed billy et al 2010 lorenz and lal 2009 mcphillips et al 2015 the data of our two studies indicated that the mechanisms of nitrate retention affected by n transformations were different between urbanized and forested or agricultural watersheds and thus the management of nitrate pollution should differ in highly urbanized watersheds sewage source reductions should be mainly considered in the management of nitrate pollution the reasons are that 1 sewage is a direct discharge to the river and therefore more straightforward to address from an engineering and cost standpoint 2 sewage is the main substrate for n transformation and therefore more beneficial to removal of nitrate through reducing nitrification and assimilation of nh4 3 controlling sewage discharge has been success for declining nitrogen loads to the estuary in some rivers such as the chesapeake bay in the united states ator et al 2019 by contrast in agricultural or forested watersheds considering fertilizer and soil as the largest nitrate contributors to the river development of better fertilization practices and agricultural extension to control release fertilizers and soil erosion yang et al 2016 4 2 factors affecting source apportionment of nitrate 4 2 1 runoff as discussed above source apportionment of nitrate is crucial to the management of nitrate pollution in the beijiang river runoff is the driving force for terrestrial source discharge into the river water ohte et al 2004 yu et al 2015 and thus runoff might affect the source apportionment of nitrate in this study the monthly variation in the source apportionment pattern of no3 was not significant p 0 05 the proportional contributions of different no3 sources were similar between the dry season and wet season during the dry season the proportional contributions from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were 49 19 and 32 respectively during the wet season the proportional contributions from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were 51 17 and 32 respectively in addition there were no significant correlations between monthly runoff and proportional contributions of different no3 sources p 0 05 fig 9 these findings suggested that monthly changes in runoff were not the major factor controlling the source distribution of no3 in the beijiang river basin however the small effect of runoff on the source apportionment of no3 did not indicate a minor influence of runoff on the flux of nitrogen from different nitrate sources according to the calculation during the wet season the fluxes of no3 n from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were 3 56 104 tons 1 28 104 tons and 2 28 104 tons respectively during the dry season the fluxes of no3 n from synthetic fertilizer domestic sewage and soil nitrogen were 1 10 104 tons 0 43 104 tons and 0 72 104 tons respectively these results suggested that increased runoff would increase the fluxes of nitrate sources 4 2 2 land use land use is the original factor affecting the spatial variation in source apportionments of no3 among regions the different types of land use could affect the characteristics of aquatic ecosystems such as water quality nutrient loading and source distribution of nitrate tromboni and dodds 2017 zorzal almeida et al 2018 in the beijiang river basin the area percentages of different land uses and land use index values showed spatial variations table 1 in addition the proportional contributions of no3 sources showed a significant spatial variation fig 4d which indicated that land use might be considered an important factor affecting no3 source apportionment previous studies have shown that the δ15n no3 value increased and displayed a higher proportion of domestic sewage contributing to nitrate in the river water as urbanization or population density increased archana et al 2018 liu et al 2018 xuan et al 2019 yi et al 2020 furthermore the δ15n no3 value decreased and the proportional contribution of fertilizer increased in agricultural areas han et al 2018 lu et al 2015 however in a catchment with mixed land uses the effect of land use on the no3 source distribution is more complex indexes that summarize many variables with a single number or classification are recognized as useful tools for watershed management zorzal almeida et al 2018 in this study the lui was proposed to evaluate the integrated effect of land use on no3 source apportionment in the beijiang river basin the lui was significantly correlated with the proportional contributions of synthetic fertilizer soil nitrogen and domestic sewage to nitrate fig 10 indicating the importance of land use to no3 source apportionment meghdadi and javar 2018 a significant negative correlation was observed between the lui and proportional contributions of synthetic fertilizer fig 10a however significant positive correlations were found between the lui and proportional contributions of soil nitrogen as well as proportional contributions of domestic sewage fig 10b and fig 10c these relationships suggested that the impacts of human activities on nitrate flux changed as the lui increased 1 an increased urbanized area resulted in an increase in point sources domestic sewage and a decrease in nonpoint sources synthetic fertilizer 2 intense human activities might increase soil erosion xia et al 2017 and subsequently increase the proportion of soil nitrogen contributing to nitrate in river water this finding indicated that land use determined the level of no3 and the increased no3 concentration was the result of exogenous sources from human activities therefore in a catchment located in an urban and rural interaction zone reduced point pollution such as domestic sewage should be considered the primary action in the nitrate pollution management of river water and the lui could be used as an index to assess the effects of land use on nitrate pollution sources zorzal almeida et al 2018 4 3 effects of land use on nitrate and isotopes as discussed above land use is an important factor affecting nitrate flux hence the effects of different land uses on nitrate variables are expected to be detectable tromboni and dodds 2017 zorzal almeida et al 2018 correlation coefficients between different land uses expressed in percent and variables related to nitrate no3 n concentrations δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values were calculated in the beijiang river basin fig 11 for the no3 n concentration urban land use was the dominant factor affecting its variations a significant positive correlation was observed between the percentage of urban area and no3 n concentration indicating that no3 pollution from urbanized areas was the dominant contributor to the increased no3 n concentration in the river water in addition the effect of urbanized area on increased no3 n concentration was similar in wet and dry seasons fig 11 this finding suggested that no3 pollution from urbanized areas could be considered a point source which would not be affected by variability in seasonal runoff hale et al 2014 however it is notable that the relative contribution of a point source could typically diminish as river runoff increases for the nitrogen isotope of nitrate the change in its values was affected by multiple land uses the δ15n no3 values were significantly positively correlated with the percentages of urban water and agricultural areas fig 11 indicating that no3 pollution from these areas was characterized by higher δ15n no3 values such as those from domestic sewage and livestock manure choi et al 2017 however the δ15n no3 value was significantly negatively correlated with the proportion of forested areas fig 11 in contrast to the urbanized and agricultural areas the no3 source from the forested area did not record the isotopic composition of the anthropogenic nitrate sources and the majority of the no3 of the forest area originated soil nitrogen with a lower δ15n no3 value barnes and raymond 2010 thus the relatively depleted δ15n no3 signal 1 19 to 5 in the watershed might be related to the high percentage of forest area and soil erosion in addition compared with other studies table s2 it was found that the δ15n no3 values in the beijiang river basin were lower than those in urbanized watersheds archana et al 2018 jani and toor 2018 liu et al 2018 wiegner et al 2016 yi et al 2020 and higher than that in the agricultural watersheds han et al 2018 luu et al 2020 this finding provided further evidence of the effects of different land uses on the nitrogen isotopes of nitrate for the oxygen isotope of nitrate the effect of land use on its variation was more pronounced in june and july fig 11 the δ18o no3 values were significantly negatively correlated with the percentages of grass and bush fallow areas this finding suggested that the δ18o no3 value was mainly related to microbial nitrification but not nitrogen sources barnes and raymond 2010 in general microbial nitrification has occurred in soils before nitrate entered to the watersheds and thus had lower δ18o no3 values 10 to 10 xue et al 2009 in june and july nitrate sources from grass and bush fallow areas into the watersheds increased due to high runoff rates leading to a decrease in the δ18o no3 value compared with other studies table s2 it was found that the δ18o no3 values in the beijiang river basin were higher than those in the forested and cultivated watersheds li et al 2019 luu et al 2020 but much lower than those in the urbanized watersheds archana et al 2018 jani and toor 2018 this finding provided further evidence that microbial nitrification was more likely to occur in forested and cultivated lands and resulted in depletions in δ18o no3 values therefore the effect of land use on the δ18o no3 value was mainly reflected in the potential of nitrification across different land uses 4 4 factor affecting nitrate flux and implications to nitrate pollution control as discussed above no3 n concentrations showed a little higher in the dry season than that in the wet season in the beijiang river basin which indicated that runoff could dilute no3 n concentrations however no3 n flux was higher in the wet season 7 10 104 tons than that in the dry season 2 27 104 tons which suggested that the nitrate flux depended on runoff in addition both the no3 n concentration and no3 n flux showed an increase trend from upstream to downstream indicating that nitrate accumulated in the downstream of the river basin the isotopic signals of nitrate removal and production processes in the beijiang river basin were weak which means the signal might be overwhelmed by addition of new nitrate to the rivers therefore in this study the major factor affecting distributions of no3 n concentrations and nitrate accumulation was exogenous sources input rather than n transformations in the river our results suggested that the imminent focus of nitrate pollution control in such a river basin should lie in the reduction of exogenous sources input exogenous discharge was directly related to the land use which determined the pattern of nitrate flux and nitrate pollution in the agricultural area fertilizer and related agricultural wastewater was the dominant nitrate source previous studies have revealed that most of farmers in china had a lack of training in fertilizer applications and a decline in applying organic fertilizers yang and fang 2015 thus development of agricultural training programs for encouraging better fertilization practices should be put in the top priority for reducing agricultural nitrate source discharged to the river in rural area in china and possibly many other regions worldwide yang et al 2016 in the urbanized area domestic sewage discharge was the dominant reason for nitrate accumulation and nitrate pollution in the rivers despite the recent developments in wastewater treatment technologies controlling sewage discharge remains more straightforward to address from an engineering and cost standpoint controlling sewage discharge is also the principal reason why nitrate loads to the downstream or estuary have been declining ator et al 2019 and therefore sewage source prevention should be a prior consideration in the management of nitrate pollution in the urbanized regions 5 conclusions knowledge of the source distribution and transformations of nitrate could provide a scientific basis for nitrate pollution management in river ecosystems in this study a dual isotope approach δ15n and δ18o was applied to identify sources and transformations of nitrate and investigate the impacts of land use and runoff on nitrate flux in a mixed land use basin the beijiang river basin the results revealed that the no3 n flux of the beijiang river basin was 9 37 104 tons in 2015 and the no3 n concentration increased along the river the data indicated that the increased no3 n concentration and nitrate accumulation in the downstream was mainly caused by inputs of exogenous nitrate sources rather than contributions of n transformations in the river this finding was different from the highly urbanized watershed in which n transformations resulted in nitrate accumulation thus reducing inputs of exogenous nitrate sources to river water was the primary action to reduce nitrate pollution in the mixed land use watershed in addition land use was recognized as the major factor affecting the source distributions of no3 n concentrations in the beijiang river basin the no3 n concentration increased significantly as the area percentage of urbanized land use increased indicating that the effect of land use on nitrate pollution was more significant in urbanized areas this study has the potential to add to knowledge of nitrate isotope patterns in mixed land use watersheds and has proved isotope values to be a useful tool for discriminating the sources of nitrate however isotope investigations such as this also has limitations because nitrate is constantly added to downstream from various sources in an open system and isotopic signal of nitrate transformed by biogeochemical processes might be overwhelmed by addition of new nitrate to the stream in the future the combination of isotope investigations with tracing techniques of 15n isotope as well as complex mechanistic models could provide better understanding of the impacts of nitrate sources and transformations on nitrate flux and nitrate pollution in the river ecosystems credit authorship contribution statement yingxue xuan investigation writing original draft guangli liu

3828,multi model ensembles enable assessment of model structural uncertainty across multiple disciplines bayesian model averaging bma is one of the most popular ensemble averaging approaches in hydrology but its predictions are easily impacted by the type of ensemble members selected here we propose a regression based ensemble approach namely a variational bayesian long short term memory network vb lstm to address this issue in this approach a state of the art variational inference vi algorithm that is faster and more scalable than bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc is employed to approximate the posterior distributions of thousands of parameters in the lstm networks to interpret the behavior of deep learning methods the permutation feature importance pfi algorithm is introduced to understand the degree to which vb lstm relies on each ensemble member twenty conceptual hydrological models are considered to evaluate bma and vb lstm in four catchments from china four scenarios with different ensemble members are established to investigate the impacts of ensemble members on model results our results show that compared with bma vb lstm improves deterministic and probabilistic predictions by approximately 10 30 in terms of mean absolute error mae sharpness and continous ranked probability score crps in addition the vb lstm predictions are more robust and less impacted by the selection of ensemble members furthermore our study encourages the use of bayesian deep learning in hydrology as an alternative to other approaches tackling model structural uncertainty keywords multi model ensembles variational inference bayesian deep learning lstm interpretability bma 1 introduction hydrological predictions are impacted by various sources of uncertainty these uncertainties can be classified into two types aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty beven et al 2011 kiureghian ditlevsen 2009 aleatoric uncertainty captures the random errors intrinsically in the observations precipitation evaporation runoff etc epistemic uncertainty comes from the idealization and assumptions of the model including parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty due to lack of knowledge about the hydrological system many studies develop methods for tackling parameter uncertainty and observational errors beven binley 1992 erdal cirpka 2019 kavetski et al 2003 kavetski et al 2006 teweldebrhan et al 2018 wani et al 2017 however fewer approaches are established for characterizing structural uncertainty in hydrological applications marshall 2017 one approach to reducing structural uncertainty is to detect and address the model deficiency beven freer 2001 liang et al 2003 würzer et al 2017 but this is difficult to implement and is constrained by the data available to specify a model instead of seeking one perfect model an alternative way is to post process ensembles of hydrological predictions formed using a set of existing models duan et al 2019 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b marshall 2017 tyralis et al 2019 different from a single deterministic model multi model ensemble predictions mep provide a representation of uncertainty by producing a predictive distribution with a form of monte carlo analysis wu et al 2020 bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 is one of the most commonly used mep models baran nemoda 2016 raftery et al 2005 proposed a standard bma that was implemented with the expectation maximation em algorithm introducing a linear regression to the standard bma to reduce the biases of the ensemble members duan et al 2007 adopted a box cox transformation box cox 1964 in bma to make ensemble members and observations more gaussian for hydrologic applications madadgar and moradkhani 2014 integrate copula functions into bma to estimate the posterior distribution of ensembles the advantage of this approach is it can be assumed that each ensemble member follows a different distribution however the limitations of bma such as the independence of ensemble members cannot be factored into this approach bma will overestimate predictive uncertainty with increasing dependence across ensemble members to achieve more reliable predictions refsgaard et al 2012 proposed a mece criterion mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive to select a suite of models as ensemble members however mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive members can conflict with each other darbandsari coulibaly 2020 a possible way forward is to use as many ensemble members as possible to include good members in the ensemble list in practice limited ensemble members will constrain the performance of bma regression based models are also frequently applied in ensemble predictions montanari koutsoyiannis 2012 wilks 2018 linear based models such as the ensemble model output statistics emos gneiting et al 2005 model have been implemented in precipitation wind speed or temperature forecasts thorarinsdottir gneiting 2010 baran nemoda 2016 the dynamic hydrometeorological system is complexly non linear but the applications of nonlinear regression based models are relatively limited and the developments are slow over the past years logistic regression hamill et al 2004 and the spectral model krishnamurti et al 1999 have been proposed in the mep over decades due to their structures as simple as linear regression models more complex but powerful methods such as the random forest artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm as combinations of multi models are commonly employed to provide point estimates rather than probabilistic predictions shamseldin et al 1997 xiong et al 2001 recent studies proposed several probabilistic anns in the mep with techniques such as quantiles bootstrap aggregating bagging and jitter inputs with noise ahn lee 2016 ahn 2020 kim et al 2020 ouarda shu 2009 rasp lerch 2018 papacharalampous et al 2019 taillardat et al 2016 these studies indicated a probabilistic ann provided a superior characterization of non linear relationships between variables than linear regression based models however they used the backpropagation based gradient descent algorithm or other deterministic optimizations to train an ann which would ignore the uncertainty of weights and biases in the ann compared with traditional machine learning methods e g ann and svm the deep learning network long short term memory lstm greff et al 2017 hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 has more delicate architecture and depth of network to capture memory dependence in time series and avoid vanishing or exploding gradient problems razavi 2021 shen et al 2018 recently lstm networks have achieved significant attention in hydrology and have been employed to provide streamflow predictions flood water level forecasts reservoir operation simulations and water table depth predictions kao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zuo et al 2020 feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 li et al 2021a li et al 2021b xiang et al 2020 these studies have shown lstm networks have superior performance than traditional machine learning we argue here that the lstm networks have the potential to make improved and robust multi model ensemble predictions but haven t been explored sufficiently in hydrology the main hurdle of constructing a fully probabilistic lstm network applied in a mep context is that lstm networks have too large a number of parameters weights and biases bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc is a popular algorithm that enables models to provide probabilistic predictions and has been widely adopted in flood mitigation water management etc ajami et al 2007 bates and campbell 2001 li et al 2017a b wu et al 2019 marshall et al 2004 however approximating large numbers of parameters with mcmc will incur high computational costs which makes mcmc prohibitive to apply in the lstm wang yeung 2016 monte carlo dropout gal and ghahramani 2015 is one promising way to approximate bayesian inference in neural networks without increasing much computational burden and has been applied in hydrology recently althoff et al 2021 worland et al 2019 fang et al 2020 however critics claim this method is not bayesian and cannot capture the true uncertainty in deep networks hron et al 2017 2018 osband 2016 variational inference vi jordan et al 1999 also known as variational bayes provides an alternative approach to deal with high dimension parameter problems generally vi turns posterior sampling into an optimization problem which makes it much faster than mcmc to approximate bayesian inference blei et al 2017 bayesian deep learning based on vi has emerged as an attractive option in natural language processing nlp anomaly detection etc fabius van amersfoort 2014 park et al 2018 while lstms provide an attractive option to combining information from multiple hydrologic models they may be considered as a black box due to a lack of interpretability duan et al 2007 reichstein et al 2019 we can easily interpret meps via linear regression models or bma according to their weights as their structures are simple but this is intractable for lstms or neural networks due to their large numbers of parameters and complex structures interpreting neural networks has become an urgent need in some eras e g autopilot voosen 2017 to overcome this limitation the permutation feature importance pfi breiman 2001 fisher et al 2019 algorithm shows promise in understanding the relationships between inputs and outputs in neural networks but has not yet been implemented sufficiently in hydrologic applications here we present a variational bayesian lstm vb lstm network to improve ensemble predictions using the pfi algorithm and a state of the art vi algorithm called gradient based stochastic variational inference svi ranganath et al 2014 the bma approach as a benchmark is employed to provide an ensemble prediction of 20 hydrological models in four catchments the impacts of the selection of ensemble members are investigated considering four scenarios our objectives are to i develop a bayesian deep learning ensemble model vb lstm using svi ii compare the robustness and predictive performance of vb lstm and bma iii interpret the vb lstm s predictive performance using pfi the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents descriptions of vb lstm bma and the pfi algorithm section 3 describes the study area data and how to implement the proposed approach section 4 5 present the results and discussion and conclusions of this study respectively 2 methodology 2 1 variational bayesian long short term memory vb lstm 2 1 1 long short term memory lstm let us consider a matrix of hydrological models m m 1 m 2 m k t as ensemble members where k denotes the number of members that form the ensemble the lstm network f ϕ m is employed to make ensemble predictions with input features m r k n and parameters weights and biases ϕ ℝ z r denotes the set of real numbers n is the length of m and z is the number of parameters in an lstm network an lstm network for regression contains several lstm layers and a fully connected layer an lstm layer has many hidden units i e neurons which consist of hidden states and cell states the hidden state and cell state can be calculated as follows 1 i t sig w mi t m t w hi h t 1 b i 2 g t sig w mg t m t w hf h t 1 b g 3 c t tanh w mc t m t w hc h t 1 b c 4 o t sig w mo t m t w ho h t 1 b o 5 c t g t c t 1 i t c t 6 h t o t tanh c t where the matrixes w mi w mg w mc w mo r k n u and w hi w hg w hc w ho r n u n u are weight parameters the vectors b i b g b c b o r n u 1 are bias parameters and the vectors i t g t c t o t r n u 1 are the input forget cell and output gates at time step t respectively c t r n u 1 is the cell state vector at time step t h t 1 r n u 1 is the hidden state vector at the last time step sig represents the sigmoid function tanh represents the hyperbolic tangent function represents the element wise multiplication operator and the index t is the time step n u is the number of hidden units the fully connected layer outputting the results with a linear regression model is 7 f ϕ m w t h b where w r n u n o is a weight matrix b r n o 1 is a bias and the matrix h r n u n is the hidden state of the last layer of an lstm network n o denotes the output size the dimension of the output is n o n the number of parameters in the lstm network can be written as z n u 4 k 4 n u n o 4 n o while an lstm network has one lstm layer with the n u hidden units here let n o 1 as we only focus on a univariate output i e streamflow this allows us to reshape the output to form a column vector output 2 1 2 stochastic variational inference svi let a vector y y 1 y n t be the observed streamflow then an lstm network for regression can be cast as 8 y f ϕ m ε ε n 0 σ 2 i where ε ε 1 ε n t is an error term vector which is usually assumed as a gaussian distribution with zero mean and diagonal covariance matrix σ 2 i σ 2 is a variance parameter and i is an identity matrix according to bayes s theorem a posterior distribution estimating parameters of an lstm network is written as 9 p θ y p y θ p θ p y where θ ϕ 1 ϕ z σ 2 t with ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ z t p y θ is the likelihood function p θ is the prior distribution p y known as the evidence is a normalizing constant and y is a vector of observed streamflow θ is a parameter vector that we have to estimate using bayesian inference we can write the evidence as p y p y θ p θ d θ in practice this integral is always high dimensional and computationally intractable with current computational resources and techniques thus sampling methods like mcmc approximating the posterior distribution are more practical than computing exact bayesian inference however slow convergence and high computational costs make mcmc sampling prohibitive when applied to estimate a large number of parameters wang yeung 2016 vi is a family of techniques that turns the approximation of posterior distributions into an optimization problem blei et al 2017 it is much faster and more scalable than mcmc sampling mcmc only generates one sample of each parameter for each iteration and the generated sample is always not effective while the parameter set space is high dimensional instead of sampling a family of distributions e g gaussian known as variational distributions is proposed to be close to the true posterior distribution p θ y in vi this is the main reason why vi is fast the proposed distribution may however result in a biased approximation this is one major drawback for the vi tradeoffs between speed and accuracy should be made in specific cases we consider the variational distributions in a form of q θ λ with variational parameters λ i e free parameters obviously θ depending on the variational parameters λ is treated as latent variables that cannot be determined directly the variational distribution is usually assumed as gaussian kingma welling 2013 however the samples from variational distribution for the variance of residuals should be kept positive thus a truncated gaussian distribution with random variables above zero denoted as n is introduced details of n can be seen in appendix a we can write ϕ n μ σ with mean vector μ and diagonal covariance matrix σ d i a g τ 1 2 τ z 2 and σ 2 n α β 2 with mean α and variance β 2 the kullback leibler kl divergence kullback leibler 1951 is applied to measure the difference between posterior distributions p θ y and the variational distributions q θ λ and can be denoted as k l p θ y q θ λ the kl divergence has three properties bishop 2006 tang et al 2016 1 non negativeness k l p θ y q θ λ 0 2 non symmetry k l p θ y q θ λ k l q θ λ p θ y 3 k l p θ y q θ λ 0 only if p θ y q θ λ in vi minimizing the kl divergence is equivalent to maximizing the evidence lower bound elbo bishop 2006 jordan et al 1999 ranganath et al 2014 the derivation of elbo can be seen in appendix b the elbo is defined as 10 ℒ λ e q log p y θ log q θ λ where e q represents an expectation with respect to q θ λ l represents the elbo p y θ is a joint distribution of y and θ and p y θ p y θ p θ in svi ranganath et al 2014 a stochastic optimization algorithm is used to maximize the elbo more detailed information about how to derive the gradient of elbo can be seen in li et al 2021a and ranganath et al 2014 in this study an improved stochastic gradient algorithm adam kingma ba 2014 is applied in svi to maximize the elbo by updating the variational parameters λ the procedure of the svi algorithm is briefly described in algorithm 1 algorithm 1 stochastic variational inference svi inputs ensemble

intel xeon e5 2680 v3 and 128 gb ram the vb lstm was developed in python using the probabilistic programming pyro bingham et al 2019 pyro supported by pytorch ketkar 2017 has been recently designed to help the programmer quickly write down deep probabilistic models other similar programmings like pymc3 salvatier et al 2016 stan carpenter et al 2017 edward tran et al 2016 and tensorflow probability dillon et al 2017 can also build probabilistic models using vi 2 2 benchmark bayesian model averaging bma the bma approach provides a mixture of ensemble members distributions usually gaussian distribution as described in raftery et al 2005 the predictive distribution of bma is given by 14 p y m k 1 k w k p y m k where w k is the posterior distribution of the k th ensemble member m k m k 1 m k n t and can be expressed as p m k y we have the fact that k 1 k w k 1 the biases in the ensemble members cannot be reduced by eq 14 raftery et al 2005 suggested using linear regression models can achieve bias corrected ensemble members m k thus we have m k a k b k m k with linear parameters a k and b k the parameters a k and b k are estimated with maximum likelihood estimation mle if each ensemble member is assumed to follow a gaussian distribution the likelihood of the bma is written as 15 l t 1 n log k 1 k w k g y m k t σ k 2 where g denotes gaussian distribution and σ k 2 is the variance of gaussian distribution this equation is complex and cannot be maximized analytically the expectation maximation em algorithm recommended by raftery et al 2005 is easy to estimate the parameters w k and σ k 2 the em algorithm iterates the parameters with two steps the e expectation step and the m maximation step an auxiliary variable z k is introduced in the e step and the mle is employed in the m step the initial values of w k and σ k 2 are set as w k i 1 k σ k i 2 1 k t 1 n y t m k t n with an initial iteration i 0 the iterations will be stopped once the log likelihood has reached convergence l i l i 1 thus the parameters w k and σ k 2 are updated using the em algorithm as follows 16 z k t i w k i 1 g y t m k t σ k i 1 2 k 1 k w k i 1 g y t m k t σ k i 1 2 σ k i 2 t 1 n

breiman 2001 fisher et al 2019 to interpret a model s behavior which can help us understand the impacts of ensemble members on the model s prediction the pfi algorithm breaks the relationship between the ensemble member and the observed streamflow by permuting individual ensemble members values then the increase in the model s error is measured after we input the permuted ensemble members into a calibrated model the pfi algorithm is described with the following steps 1 inputs ensemble members m m 1 m k t a calibrated model 2 estimate the model s base score e e g mean absolute error with raw data m 3 for each ensemble member m k generate a new ensemble list m m 1 m k m k t with permuted or shuffled ensemble member m k 4 estimate the model s score e k with the calibrated model using m as

study catchments and hydrological models four catchments located in china are used to evaluate the ensemble performances of vb lstm and bma fig 2 each catchment is named after the hydrological station at the outlet of the catchment different geographical and climatic characteristics of the four catchments are listed in table 1 the drainage area ranges from 2 672 to 122 000 km2 and the mean annual precipitation varies from 506 to 1 899 mm in the four catchments daily meteorological data including precipitation mean air temperature are downloaded from china meteorological administration https data cma cn meteorological stations near catchments are also considered to fill in the lack of meteorological data fig 2 some daily precipitation data were collected from rain gauge stations fig 2 the data ranges for the forcing data and daily streamflow are shown in table 1 in this study we identified 20 conceptual hydrological models listed in table 2 to get a wide variety of streamflow predictions at the outlets of the four catchments these models are provided from the hydrological prediction laboratory hoopla seiller et al 2012 thiboult anctil boucher 2016 thiboult et al 2020 which is an open source toolbox coded in matlab models of the hoopla toolbox are based on commonly available hydrological models that conceptualize the rainfall runoff process in a lumped mode they have diverse structures with 4 to 10 parameters and 2 to 7 reservoirs a parsimonious formula oudin et al 2005 is adopted to calculate the potential evapotranspiration because the formula uses daily mean temperature as the only input data some models are slightly modified to fit a common framework the related literature of these models is given in table 2 3 2 data transformation before we apply vb lstm and bma as described in section 2 a one parameter box cox transformation box cox 1964 is performed to make ensemble members and observations more normal and homoscedastic sakia 1992 the transformation is given by 17 x x λ 1 λ f o r λ 0 x 0 log x f o r λ 0 x 0 where λ denotes the parameter of box cox transformation x and x are untransformed and transformed data vectors respectively the parameter λ is set to the average of two values estimated with the mle method and kolmogorov smirnov test statistic 3 3 performance assessment various measures are performed to evaluate the performance of ensemble predictions in this study deterministic predictions which denote the mean of predictive distribution are evaluated by the taylor diagram taylor 2001 and mean average error mae the taylor diagram quantifies the fitness of observed and modeled data in terms of pearson correlation coefficient root mean square error rmse and standard deviation mae is written as 18 mae 1 n t 1 n y o t y p t where y o t and y p t are the observation and deterministic prediction at time step t probabilistic predictions are evaluated by the continous ranked probability score crps reliability and sharpness crps hersbach 2000 is an overall metric of quantifying uncertainty the lower the better c r p s 0 means the prediction equals the observation crps is calculated as follows 19 crps 1 n t 1 n p t y h y y o t 2 d y with 20 h x 0 fo r x 0 1 f o r x 0 where y is one value of a model s predictive distribution y p at time step t p t y is the cumulative density function cdf of y p at time step t for the value y h x is known as the heaviside function with a random variable x the detailed crps can be seen in hersbach 2000 reliability is derived from the predictive quantile quantile qq plot laio tamea 2007 thyer et al 2009 in the predictive qq plot if the distribution obtained from the probability integral transform pit of observation is uniform the predictive distribution will be correct let p y p t be the cdf of y p t y p t denotes the model s predictive distribution at time step t thus the value of p y p t for the observation y o t can be expressed as ψ t p y p t y o t we use p ψ known as the pit of y o y o 1 y o n to represent the cdf of ψ ψ 1 ψ n reliability measures the linearity of the predictive qq plot which represents the fitness of uniform distribution u 0 1 and p ψ thus reliability varies between 0 worst and 1 perfect and can be computed as follows 21 ζ 1 2 n t 1 n ψ t 1 t sharpness smith et al 2015 wu et al 2019 is the mean width of the predictive uncertainty band in a specific prediction interval a 90 prediction interval is applied in this study a smaller sharpness is preferred while the models predictions have the same reliability the sharpness is written as 22 γ 1 n t 1 n y 95 t y 5 t where y 95 t and y 5 t represent 95 and 5 uncertainty bounds of a model predictive distribution at time step t respectively 3 4 prior likelihood and variational distributions the prior distribution reflects previous information about parameters uncertainty we assume the prior distributions of the lstm s parameters ϕ are gaussian distributions the prior of residual variance σ 2 follows a gaussian distribution truncated at zero as the variance is positive calculations may benefit from similar distributions between prior and variational distributions obviously the mean and variance of gaussian distributions are the variational parameters here the initial values of variational parameters for mean and standard deviation are mandatorily set as zero and one tenth of the corresponding prior s standard deviation respectively thus these priors and initial variational distributions are 23 ϕ n 0 i σ 2 n 0 1 ϕ μ σ n μ 0 σ 0 1 i σ 2 α β 2 n α 0 β 2 0 79 2 the likelihood function measures the fitness of observation and simulation if we assume data are normally heteroscedastic and independent the log likelihood function is written as 24 l n 2 log 2 π σ 2 1 2 t 1 t n ε t 2 σ 2 λ 1 t 1 t n log y o t where λ is the parameter of a one parameter box cox transformation ε t is the residual in eq 8 at time step t and y o t is the observed streamflow at time step t 3 5 approach in this study we compared the ensemble prediction performance of bma and vb lstm twenty conceptual hydrological models were adopted to reproduce the streamflow in the four catchments table 1 lists the periods of calibration and validation we utilized the previous year of the calibration period as a warm up period the shuffled compex evolution method sce ua duan et al 1993 calibrated each hydrological model with the objective function of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 ensemble predictions from the hydrological models were achieved with vb lstm and bma before applying vb lstm and bma we transformed the simulated streamflow produced by hydrological models with box cox transformation here vb lstm with one lstm layer and 30 hidden units was used to make predictions using full batch learning this means the svi algorithm had to estimate 6151 parameters of the lstm network while the input size is 20 note that the number of hidden units was manually chosen with the trial and error method the learning rate of adam is 0 003 the maximum training epoch is 50 000 we applied an early stopping technique bishop 2006 in vb lstm to avoid overfitting as the method is easy to be implemented the first 70 of calibration data were used to train vb lstm and the remaining calibration data were used to terminate the training progress other popular overfitting techniques like dropout srivastava et al 2014 and l2 regularization bishop 2006 cannot be directly applied to variational bayesian deep learning to evaluate the impacts of selected ensemble members we considered four scenarios of ensemble members in terms of hydrological models performances the nse values of 20 hydrological models during the calibration period were arranged in descending order then four scenarios a d were designed intuitively as follows a all twenty hydrological models are considered b good ensemble members consist of 5 hydrological models that have the best values of nse rankings 1 5 c medium ensemble members are the 5 hydrological models that have medium values of nse rankings 8 12 d poor ensemble members are the 5 worst performances of hydrological models rankings 16 20 4 results and discussion we compared the ensemble performances of vb lstm and bma in terms of their deterministic and probabilistic predictions the periods of calibration and validation are shown in table 1 twenty hydrological models were considered as the whole list of ensemble members we designed four scenarios a d differing in which member was considered into the ensemble list scenario a has all 20 members and the remaining scenarios b d only have 5 members with good medium and poor members according to their rank order of nse values respectively fig 3 shows the training progress of vb lstm made on the elbo for scenario a generally optimizing a standard lstm is performed on backpropagation and its loss function usually is the mean square error mse metric a standard lstm can provide point i e deterministic estimates but are poor at quantifying predictive uncertainty considering the proposed bayesian deep learning approach vb lstm the variational inference approach svi was used to estimate the uncertainty of large parameters in an lstm network elbo was the vb lstm s loss function and was optimized with gradient optimization over epochs a larger elbo means the variational distributions become closer to the true posterior distribution here the last 30 of the calibration period hereafter testing period was used to terminate the training progress of vb lstm this means we maximized the elbo over the testing period blue line in fig 3 with an early stopping technique the training was stopped while the maximum value of testing s elbo was not changed within 2000 epochs fig 3 illustrates the value of testing s elbo has plateaued to get maximum over epochs and thus the training is stopped besides the training epochs range from approximately 9500 to 16000 and the computing time varies from about 3 5 to 11 h in the four catchments compared with other catchments the shiquan catchment exhibits the least computing time as it has the fewest training epochs and shortest calibration period other scenarios have similar training progress and thus are not discussed here figs 4 and 5 show comparisons of deterministic predictions of vb lstm and bma for each catchment over the calibration and validation periods green circles in fig 4 indicate the hydrological models overall vb lstm exhibits better deterministic predictions than hydrological models and bma for all scenarios although the superiority has slight degradation in the validation period fig 4 presents taylor diagrams of comparison results taylor diagrams provide multiple assessments of model performances that combine three metrics pearson correlation coefficient rmse and standard deviation for each scenario it is demonstrated in fig 4 that the vb lstm tends to have higher correlations lower rmse and closer to the observational standard deviation in all catchments fig 5 illustrates the proposed approach exhibits lower mae than bma during calibration and validation periods by approximately 18 5 and 12 0 respectively trend lines for scenarios a to d are plotted in fig 5 to analyze the impacts of member selections for bma and vb lstm from the analysis of trend lines we can find that the trend lines of bma are steeper than those of vb lstm suggesting that bma is more easily impacted by the selection of ensemble members bma with good members tends to have lower mae than bma with poor members specifically for the bma scenario a containing all 20 members provides the lowest mae scenario b with good members has similar values of mae to scenario a scenario d with poor members exhibits the highest mae followed by scenario c with medium members compared with bma the trend lines of vb lstm are almost flat in most cases fig 5a1 a2 b1 c2 d1 and d2 thus vb lstm slightly improves the mae values in scenario a approximately 13 5 and 7 3 respectively in the calibration and validation but largely improves the mae values in scenario d approximately 31 9 and 23 0 respectively in the calibration and validation this indicates vb lstm can provide more robust and accurate deterministic predictions than bma although their performance becomes closer while the ensemble members are high quality the predictive qq plots and reliability over the validation period are illustrated in fig 6 fig 6 shows the predictive qq plots of vb lstm are more straight than those of bma in most cases suggesting that the vb lstm provides higher reliable probabilistic predictions specifically compared with bma the vb lstm significantly reduces the biases in the tangnaihai catchment and wushan catchment vb lstm and bma exhibit comparably reliable performance with similar linearity of predictive qq plots in the remaining catchments further reliability is used to measure the linearity of the predictive qq plots shown in fig 6a5 d5 it is demonstrated that the vb lstm provides higher values of reliability than bma in most cases although vb lstm provides slightly lower values of reliability in the tunxi catchment its predictions still can be considered comparably reliable as the values of its reliability are over 0 9 note that reliability or visualizing the predictive qq plots cannot give sufficient information on the predictive uncertainty thus sharpness and crps are calculated to complement other measures of predictive uncertainty figs 7 and 8 show sharpness and crps over calibration and validation periods in the four scenarios respectively similar conclusions can be reached as those of analyzing deterministic predictions above it is demonstrated that the vb lstm exhibits lower uncertainty estimates with smaller sharpness and crps than bma in most cases besides the sharpness and crps of the proposed approach are less impacted by the selection of members as their trendlines are flatter the performance of bma has a direct relationship with selections of members which can be concluded as scenario a b c d but the vb lstm does not show this relationship the performance of vb lstm is relatively stable in different scenarios in terms of sharpness the vb lstm has approximately 26 7 24 1 narrower prediction intervals on average than bma in the calibration validation period fig 7 in terms of crps it is approximately 23 6 14 1 lower on average than bma in the calibration validation period fig 8 note that in the wushan catchment scenario b of bma has a narrower sharpness shown in fig 7c2 but less reliability fig 6c5 over the validation period this means a sharp prediction does not imply reliable crps is an overall probabilistic performance score and can help us quantify predictive uncertainty further the crps of vb lstm in the wushan catchment is lower than that of bma overall the vb lstm has a better performance in probabilistic predictions for improving our understanding of a model s behavior fig 9 shows the importance of 20 ensemble members of vb lstm and bma in scenario a during the calibration period besides bma s weights nse and spearman correlation matrix of 20 members in four catchments are shown in fig 9 the order of a member for each catchment was sorted by the rank order of the member s weight of bma the importance of a member was measured via the pfi algorithm large importance represents the ensemble model s prediction heavily relies on this member note that deterministic and probabilistic predictions were assessed with different scores the probabilistic metric crps generalizes the mean absolute error mae which is a deterministic metric it will reduce to mae if predictions are deterministic gneiting raftery 2007 thus the crps can be used to have a direct comparison of deterministic and probabilistic predictions gneiting raftery 2007 here we used crps as a score function of the pfi algorithm to calculate the importance the weights of bma w k reflects the impacts of members on the bma s predictions their rank order is almost the same as that of importance columns 2 3 in fig 9 in addition the values of importance and weights are relatively close this indicates the importance is a useful alternative to interpret the bma the rank order of nse tends to be similar to that of the bma s weights but this is not a direct relationship columns 3 4 in fig 9 this can explain to some extent why scenario b good members of bma always has better performance than medium or poor members of bma i e scenarios c and d however the rank order of vb lstm s importance exhibits a big difference from that of bma s weights and nse columns 1 3 in fig 9 even a member that has a smaller value of nse than that of most members can have the highest importance in the vb lstm e g bucket model in the shiquan catchment and martine model in the wushan catchment this may reflect the fact that the members are highly correlated as shown in column 5 of fig 9 vb lstm can extract non linear relationships between variables thus it produced close results in different scenarios 5 summary and conclusions the multi model ensemble prediction is the main approach to reduce model structure uncertainty among various techniques bma is one of the most popular ensemble methods in hydrology actually bma performs soft model selection to find better members in the ensemble member list and average them this means that bma cannot be expected to do better when the true member i e close or same with observation does not lie in the ensemble member list hoege et al 2019 lakshminarayanan et al 2017 we proposed a regression based ensemble method vb lstm to improve streamflow predictions svi as an alternative to bayesian mcmc sampling was applied to provide a fast approximation of posterior distributions note that the detailed comparisons of svi and mcmc are beyond the scope of our research and can be seen in related literature wang and yeung 2016 results show that the proposed model mitigates the impacts of member selections and can combine the members to achieve a more powerful model that cannot be realized by bma this indicates that vb lstm with delicate structures and large numbers of parameters is able to capture non linearities and time dependencies to some extent the more significant the improvement the stronger the non linearities and time dependencies of extraction bma will be preferred in hydrological applications according to occam s razor i e the principle of parsimony if bma and vb lstm have similar predictive performance previous literature has shown bayesian approaches can avoid overfitting of deep learning to some extent as prior is a form of regularization e g gaussian prior is equivalent to l2 regularization ghahramani 2013 wang and yeung 2020 vb lstm may still exist overfitting due to a large number of parameters thus we applied an early stopping technique to avoid overfitting as the technique is easy to fit in a bayesian framework the importance estimated with pfi was used to interpret or reflect the impacts of ensemble members on vb lstm interpreting deep learning can help us understand the model s behaviors but it is still too hard to achieve accurate estimations now voosen 2017 beyond scope of our research pfi may help identify significant preditors before formulating a predictive model and complement other commonly used identification methods like partial information correlation pic sharma 2000 sharma mehrotra 2014 pfi algorithm used in this study is just one choice to interpret deep learning and other popular model agnostic methods like local interpretable model agnostic explanations lime ribeiro et al 2016 and shapley additive explanations shap lundberg lee 2017 can be tried in the future to investigate the impacts of member selections we applied bma and vb lstm to predict four catchments streamflows which considers four scenarios based on the performance of ensemble members vb lstm exhibits better deterministic predictions in terms of the taylor diagram and mae than bma the predictive qq plot and three assessment scores namely reliability sharpness and crps were employed to evaluate the performance of probabilistic predictions compared with bma the predictive qq plot and reliability shows vb lstm is more reliable and less biased smaller sharpness and crps show vb lstm produces less predictive uncertainty by comparing different scenarios results show vb lstm is more robust and is less impacted by member selections than bma in general only the results obtained for the validation period i e the out of sample results are of practical relevance this holds although results obtained for the calibration period i e in sample results are often reported in hydrological modeling works as we did in this study note that good medium and poor ensemble members were distinguished mandatorily with their nse values analysis of importance indicates vb lstm and bma rely on individual members to varying degrees this leads to their different model behaviors specifically bma with better ensemble members tends to have better deterministic and probabilistic predictions the reason may be that the importance of members for bma has a similar rank order with the nse of members this means high nse values of members may have high impacts on predictions and can result in good predictions for bma however vb lstm with better ensemble members sometimes produces not better predictions this is mainly because the importance of members for vb lstm has a different ranking order from the nse of members also high correlations between members may impact the vb lstm s predictions as vb lstm has a powerful ability to extract non linear patterns between variables our study encourages variational bayesian deep learning applied in hydrological ensemble predictions especially while there is a lack of good ensemble members four limitations may exist in our study the first one is that each training of vb lstm still consumes serval computing hours on a desktop computer instead of cpu gpu acceleration may be a promising way to greatly speed the training of vb lstm the second is that we manually calibrate the hyperparameters of vb lstm e g learning rate and numbers of hidden units with trial and error as high computational costs make autocalibration prohibitive the third limitation is that physically based distributed hydrological models such as mike she li et al 2019 refsgaard et al 2010 are not included in our ensemble member list the last limitation is that only four catchments are tested for the proposed method and bma in this study more generalized conclusions can be made through comparisons across a large number e g hundreds of sites boulesteix et al 2018 these limitations can be considered in future studies credit authorship contribution statement dayang li

3828,multi model ensembles enable assessment of model structural uncertainty across multiple disciplines bayesian model averaging bma is one of the most popular ensemble averaging approaches in hydrology but its predictions are easily impacted by the type of ensemble members selected here we propose a regression based ensemble approach namely a variational bayesian long short term memory network vb lstm to address this issue in this approach a state of the art variational inference vi algorithm that is faster and more scalable than bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc is employed to approximate the posterior distributions of thousands of parameters in the lstm networks to interpret the behavior of deep learning methods the permutation feature importance pfi algorithm is introduced to understand the degree to which vb lstm relies on each ensemble member twenty conceptual hydrological models are considered to evaluate bma and vb lstm in four catchments from china four scenarios with different ensemble members are established to investigate the impacts of ensemble members on model results our results show that compared with bma vb lstm improves deterministic and probabilistic predictions by approximately 10 30 in terms of mean absolute error mae sharpness and continous ranked probability score crps in addition the vb lstm predictions are more robust and less impacted by the selection of ensemble members furthermore our study encourages the use of bayesian deep learning in hydrology as an alternative to other approaches tackling model structural uncertainty keywords multi model ensembles variational inference bayesian deep learning lstm interpretability bma 1 introduction hydrological predictions are impacted by various sources of uncertainty these uncertainties can be classified into two types aleatoric uncertainty and epistemic uncertainty beven et al 2011 kiureghian ditlevsen 2009 aleatoric uncertainty captures the random errors intrinsically in the observations precipitation evaporation runoff etc epistemic uncertainty comes from the idealization and assumptions of the model including parameter uncertainty and structural uncertainty due to lack of knowledge about the hydrological system many studies develop methods for tackling parameter uncertainty and observational errors beven binley 1992 erdal cirpka 2019 kavetski et al 2003 kavetski et al 2006 teweldebrhan et al 2018 wani et al 2017 however fewer approaches are established for characterizing structural uncertainty in hydrological applications marshall 2017 one approach to reducing structural uncertainty is to detect and address the model deficiency beven freer 2001 liang et al 2003 würzer et al 2017 but this is difficult to implement and is constrained by the data available to specify a model instead of seeking one perfect model an alternative way is to post process ensembles of hydrological predictions formed using a set of existing models duan et al 2019 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b marshall 2017 tyralis et al 2019 different from a single deterministic model multi model ensemble predictions mep provide a representation of uncertainty by producing a predictive distribution with a form of monte carlo analysis wu et al 2020 bayesian model averaging bma hoeting et al 1999 is one of the most commonly used mep models baran nemoda 2016 raftery et al 2005 proposed a standard bma that was implemented with the expectation maximation em algorithm introducing a linear regression to the standard bma to reduce the biases of the ensemble members duan et al 2007 adopted a box cox transformation box cox 1964 in bma to make ensemble members and observations more gaussian for hydrologic applications madadgar and moradkhani 2014 integrate copula functions into bma to estimate the posterior distribution of ensembles the advantage of this approach is it can be assumed that each ensemble member follows a different distribution however the limitations of bma such as the independence of ensemble members cannot be factored into this approach bma will overestimate predictive uncertainty with increasing dependence across ensemble members to achieve more reliable predictions refsgaard et al 2012 proposed a mece criterion mutually exclusive collectively exhaustive to select a suite of models as ensemble members however mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive members can conflict with each other darbandsari coulibaly 2020 a possible way forward is to use as many ensemble members as possible to include good members in the ensemble list in practice limited ensemble members will constrain the performance of bma regression based models are also frequently applied in ensemble predictions montanari koutsoyiannis 2012 wilks 2018 linear based models such as the ensemble model output statistics emos gneiting et al 2005 model have been implemented in precipitation wind speed or temperature forecasts thorarinsdottir gneiting 2010 baran nemoda 2016 the dynamic hydrometeorological system is complexly non linear but the applications of nonlinear regression based models are relatively limited and the developments are slow over the past years logistic regression hamill et al 2004 and the spectral model krishnamurti et al 1999 have been proposed in the mep over decades due to their structures as simple as linear regression models more complex but powerful methods such as the random forest artificial neural network ann and support vector machine svm as combinations of multi models are commonly employed to provide point estimates rather than probabilistic predictions shamseldin et al 1997 xiong et al 2001 recent studies proposed several probabilistic anns in the mep with techniques such as quantiles bootstrap aggregating bagging and jitter inputs with noise ahn lee 2016 ahn 2020 kim et al 2020 ouarda shu 2009 rasp lerch 2018 papacharalampous et al 2019 taillardat et al 2016 these studies indicated a probabilistic ann provided a superior characterization of non linear relationships between variables than linear regression based models however they used the backpropagation based gradient descent algorithm or other deterministic optimizations to train an ann which would ignore the uncertainty of weights and biases in the ann compared with traditional machine learning methods e g ann and svm the deep learning network long short term memory lstm greff et al 2017 hochreiter schmidhuber 1997 has more delicate architecture and depth of network to capture memory dependence in time series and avoid vanishing or exploding gradient problems razavi 2021 shen et al 2018 recently lstm networks have achieved significant attention in hydrology and have been employed to provide streamflow predictions flood water level forecasts reservoir operation simulations and water table depth predictions kao et al 2020 kratzert et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 zuo et al 2020 feng et al 2020 kratzert et al 2018 li et al 2021a li et al 2021b xiang et al 2020 these studies have shown lstm networks have superior performance than traditional machine learning we argue here that the lstm networks have the potential to make improved and robust multi model ensemble predictions but haven t been explored sufficiently in hydrology the main hurdle of constructing a fully probabilistic lstm network applied in a mep context is that lstm networks have too large a number of parameters weights and biases bayesian markov chain monte carlo mcmc is a popular algorithm that enables models to provide probabilistic predictions and has been widely adopted in flood mitigation water management etc ajami et al 2007 bates and campbell 2001 li et al 2017a b wu et al 2019 marshall et al 2004 however approximating large numbers of parameters with mcmc will incur high computational costs which makes mcmc prohibitive to apply in the lstm wang yeung 2016 monte carlo dropout gal and ghahramani 2015 is one promising way to approximate bayesian inference in neural networks without increasing much computational burden and has been applied in hydrology recently althoff et al 2021 worland et al 2019 fang et al 2020 however critics claim this method is not bayesian and cannot capture the true uncertainty in deep networks hron et al 2017 2018 osband 2016 variational inference vi jordan et al 1999 also known as variational bayes provides an alternative approach to deal with high dimension parameter problems generally vi turns posterior sampling into an optimization problem which makes it much faster than mcmc to approximate bayesian inference blei et al 2017 bayesian deep learning based on vi has emerged as an attractive option in natural language processing nlp anomaly detection etc fabius van amersfoort 2014 park et al 2018 while lstms provide an attractive option to combining information from multiple hydrologic models they may be considered as a black box due to a lack of interpretability duan et al 2007 reichstein et al 2019 we can easily interpret meps via linear regression models or bma according to their weights as their structures are simple but this is intractable for lstms or neural networks due to their large numbers of parameters and complex structures interpreting neural networks has become an urgent need in some eras e g autopilot voosen 2017 to overcome this limitation the permutation feature importance pfi breiman 2001 fisher et al 2019 algorithm shows promise in understanding the relationships between inputs and outputs in neural networks but has not yet been implemented sufficiently in hydrologic applications here we present a variational bayesian lstm vb lstm network to improve ensemble predictions using the pfi algorithm and a state of the art vi algorithm called gradient based stochastic variational inference svi ranganath et al 2014 the bma approach as a benchmark is employed to provide an ensemble prediction of 20 hydrological models in four catchments the impacts of the selection of ensemble members are investigated considering four scenarios our objectives are to i develop a bayesian deep learning ensemble model vb lstm using svi ii compare the robustness and predictive performance of vb lstm and bma iii interpret the vb lstm s predictive performance using pfi the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents descriptions of vb lstm bma and the pfi algorithm section 3 describes the study area data and how to implement the proposed approach section 4 5 present the results and discussion and conclusions of this study respectively 2 methodology 2 1 variational bayesian long short term memory vb lstm 2 1 1 long short term memory lstm let us consider a matrix of hydrological models m m 1 m 2 m k t as ensemble members where k denotes the number of members that form the ensemble the lstm network f ϕ m is employed to make ensemble predictions with input features m r k n and parameters weights and biases ϕ ℝ z r denotes the set of real numbers n is the length of m and z is the number of parameters in an lstm network an lstm network for regression contains several lstm layers and a fully connected layer an lstm layer has many hidden units i e neurons which consist of hidden states and cell states the hidden state and cell state can be calculated as follows 1 i t sig

cell and output gates at time step t respectively c t r n u 1 is the cell state vector at time step t h t 1 r n u 1 is the hidden state vector at the last time step sig represents the sigmoid function tanh represents the hyperbolic tangent function represents the element wise multiplication operator and the index t is the time step n u is the number of hidden units the fully connected layer outputting the results with a linear regression model is 7 f ϕ m w t h b where w r n u n o is a weight matrix b r n o 1 is a bias and the matrix h r n u n is the hidden state of the last layer of an lstm network n o denotes the output size the dimension of the output is n o n the number of parameters in the lstm network can be written as z n u 4 k 4 n u n o 4 n o while an lstm network has one lstm layer with the n u hidden units here let n o 1 as we only focus on a univariate output i e streamflow this allows us to reshape the output to form a column vector output 2 1 2 stochastic variational inference svi let a vector y y 1 y n t be the observed streamflow then an lstm network for regression can be cast as 8 y f ϕ m ε ε n 0 σ 2 i where ε ε 1 ε n t is an error term vector which is usually assumed as a gaussian distribution with zero mean and diagonal covariance matrix σ 2 i σ 2 is a variance parameter and i is an identity matrix according to bayes s theorem a posterior distribution estimating parameters of an lstm network is written as 9 p θ y p y θ p θ p y where θ ϕ 1 ϕ z σ 2 t with ϕ ϕ 1 ϕ z t p y θ is the likelihood function p θ is the prior distribution p y known as the evidence is a normalizing constant and y is a vector of observed streamflow θ is a parameter vector that we have to estimate using bayesian inference we can write the evidence as p y p y θ p θ d θ in practice this integral is always high dimensional and computationally intractable with current computational resources and techniques thus sampling methods like mcmc approximating the posterior distribution are more practical than computing exact bayesian inference however slow convergence and high computational costs make mcmc sampling prohibitive when applied to estimate a large number of parameters wang yeung 2016 vi is a family of techniques that turns the approximation of posterior distributions into an optimization problem blei et al 2017 it is much faster and more scalable than mcmc sampling mcmc only generates one sample of each parameter for each iteration and the generated sample is always not effective while the parameter set space is high dimensional instead of sampling a family of distributions e g gaussian known as variational distributions is proposed to be close to the true posterior distribution p θ y in vi this is the main reason why vi is fast the proposed distribution may however result in a biased approximation this is one major drawback for the vi tradeoffs between speed and accuracy should be made in specific cases we consider the variational distributions in a form of q θ λ with variational parameters λ i e free parameters obviously θ depending on the variational parameters λ is treated as latent variables that cannot be determined directly the variational distribution is usually assumed as gaussian kingma welling 2013 however the samples from variational distribution for the variance of residuals should be kept positive thus a truncated gaussian distribution with random variables above zero denoted as n is introduced details of n can be seen in appendix a we can write ϕ n μ σ with mean vector μ and diagonal covariance matrix σ d i a g τ 1 2 τ z 2 and σ 2 n α β 2 with mean α and variance β 2 the kullback leibler kl divergence kullback leibler 1951 is applied to measure the difference between posterior distributions p θ y and the variational distributions q θ λ and can be denoted as k l p θ y q θ λ the kl divergence has three properties bishop 2006 tang et al 2016 1 non negativeness k l p θ y q θ λ

intel xeon e5 2680 v3 and 128 gb ram the vb lstm was developed in python using the probabilistic programming pyro bingham et al 2019 pyro supported by pytorch ketkar 2017 has been recently designed to help the programmer quickly write down deep probabilistic models other similar programmings like pymc3 salvatier et al 2016 stan carpenter et al 2017 edward tran et al 2016 and tensorflow probability dillon et al 2017 can also build probabilistic models using vi 2 2 benchmark bayesian model averaging bma the bma approach provides a mixture of ensemble members distributions usually gaussian distribution as described in raftery et al 2005 the predictive distribution of bma is given by 14 p y m k 1 k w k p y m k where w k is the posterior distribution of the k th ensemble member m k m k 1 m k n t and can be expressed as p m k y we have the fact that k 1 k w k 1 the biases in the ensemble members cannot be reduced by eq 14 raftery et al 2005 suggested using linear regression models can achieve bias corrected ensemble members m k thus we have m k a k b k m k with linear parameters a k and b k the parameters a k and b k are estimated with maximum likelihood estimation mle if each ensemble member is assumed to follow a gaussian distribution the likelihood of the bma is written as 15 l t 1 n log k 1 k w k g y m k t σ k 2 where g denotes gaussian distribution and σ k 2 is the variance of gaussian distribution this equation is complex and cannot be maximized analytically the expectation maximation em algorithm recommended by raftery et al 2005 is easy to estimate the parameters w k and σ k 2 the em algorithm iterates the parameters with two steps the e expectation step and the m maximation step an auxiliary variable z k is introduced in the e step and the mle is employed in the m step the initial values of w k and σ k 2 are set as w k i 1 k σ k i 2 1 k t 1 n y t m k t n with an initial iteration i 0 the iterations will be stopped once the log likelihood has reached convergence l i l i 1 thus the parameters w k and σ k 2 are updated using the em algorithm as follows 16 z k t i w k i 1 g y t m k t σ k i 1 2 k 1 k w k i 1 g y t m k t σ k i 1 2 σ k i 2 t 1 n

breiman 2001 fisher et al 2019 to interpret a model s behavior which can help us understand the impacts of ensemble members on the model s prediction the pfi algorithm breaks the relationship between the ensemble member and the observed streamflow by permuting individual ensemble members values then the increase in the model s error is measured after we input the permuted ensemble members into a calibrated model the pfi algorithm is described with the following steps 1 inputs ensemble members m m 1 m k t a calibrated model 2 estimate the model s base score e e g mean absolute error with raw

study catchments and hydrological models four catchments located in china are used to evaluate the ensemble performances of vb lstm and bma fig 2 each catchment is named after the hydrological station at the outlet of the catchment different geographical and climatic characteristics of the four catchments are listed in table 1 the drainage area ranges from 2 672 to 122 000 km2 and the mean annual precipitation varies from 506 to 1 899 mm in the four catchments daily meteorological data including precipitation mean air temperature are downloaded from china meteorological administration https data cma cn meteorological stations near catchments are also considered to fill in the lack of meteorological data fig 2 some daily precipitation data were collected from rain gauge stations fig 2 the data ranges for the forcing data and daily streamflow are shown in table 1 in this study we identified 20 conceptual hydrological models listed in table 2 to get a wide variety of streamflow predictions at the outlets of the four catchments these models are provided from the hydrological prediction laboratory hoopla seiller et al 2012 thiboult anctil boucher 2016 thiboult et al 2020 which is an open source toolbox coded in matlab models of the hoopla toolbox are based on commonly available hydrological models that conceptualize the rainfall runoff process in a lumped mode they have diverse structures with 4 to 10 parameters and 2 to 7 reservoirs a parsimonious formula oudin et al 2005 is adopted to calculate the potential evapotranspiration because the formula uses daily mean temperature as the only input data some models are slightly modified to fit a common framework the related literature of these models is given in table 2 3 2 data transformation before we apply vb lstm and bma as described in section 2 a one parameter box cox transformation box cox 1964 is performed to make ensemble members and observations more normal and homoscedastic sakia 1992 the transformation is given by 17 x x λ 1 λ f o r λ 0 x 0 log x f o r λ 0 x 0 where λ denotes the parameter of box cox transformation x and x are untransformed and transformed data vectors respectively the parameter λ is set to the average of two values estimated with the mle method and kolmogorov smirnov test statistic 3 3 performance assessment various measures are performed to evaluate the performance of ensemble predictions in this study deterministic predictions which denote the mean of predictive distribution are evaluated by the taylor diagram taylor 2001 and mean average error mae the taylor diagram quantifies the fitness of observed and modeled data in terms of pearson correlation coefficient root mean square error rmse and standard deviation mae is written as 18 mae 1 n t 1 n y o t y p t where y o t and y p t are the observation and deterministic prediction at time step t probabilistic predictions are evaluated by the continous ranked probability score crps reliability and sharpness crps hersbach 2000 is an overall metric of quantifying uncertainty the lower the better c r p s 0 means the prediction equals the observation crps is calculated as follows 19 crps 1 n t 1 n p t y h y y o t 2 d y with 20 h x 0 fo r x 0 1 f o r x 0 where y is one value of a model s predictive distribution y p at time step t p t y is the cumulative density function cdf of y p at time step t for the value y h x is known as the heaviside function with a random variable x the detailed crps can be seen in hersbach 2000 reliability is derived from the predictive quantile quantile qq plot laio tamea 2007 thyer et al 2009 in the predictive qq plot if the distribution obtained from the probability integral transform pit of observation is uniform the predictive distribution will be correct let p y p t be the cdf of y p t y p t denotes the model s predictive distribution at time step t thus the value of p y p t for the observation y o t can be expressed as ψ t p y p t y o t we use p ψ known as the pit of y o y o 1 y o n to represent the cdf of ψ ψ 1 ψ n reliability measures the linearity of the predictive qq plot which represents the fitness of uniform distribution u 0 1 and p ψ thus reliability varies between 0 worst and 1 perfect and can be computed as follows 21 ζ 1 2 n t 1 n ψ t 1 t sharpness smith et al 2015 wu et al 2019 is the mean width of the predictive uncertainty band in a specific prediction interval a 90 prediction interval is applied in this study a smaller sharpness is preferred while the models predictions have the same reliability the sharpness is written as 22 γ 1 n t 1 n y 95 t y 5 t where y 95 t and y 5 t represent 95 and 5 uncertainty bounds of a model predictive distribution at time step t respectively 3 4 prior likelihood and variational distributions the prior distribution reflects previous information about parameters uncertainty we assume the prior distributions of the lstm s parameters ϕ are gaussian distributions the prior of residual variance σ 2 follows a gaussian distribution truncated at zero as the variance is positive calculations may benefit from similar distributions between prior and variational distributions obviously the mean and variance of gaussian distributions are the variational parameters here the initial values of variational parameters for mean and standard deviation are mandatorily set as zero and one tenth of the corresponding prior s standard deviation respectively thus these priors and initial variational distributions are 23 ϕ n 0 i σ 2 n 0 1 ϕ μ σ n μ 0 σ 0 1 i σ 2 α β 2 n α 0 β 2 0 79 2 the likelihood function measures the fitness of observation and simulation if we assume data are normally heteroscedastic and independent the log likelihood function is written as 24 l n 2 log 2 π σ 2 1 2 t 1 t n ε t 2 σ 2 λ 1 t 1 t n log y o t where λ is the parameter of a one parameter box cox transformation ε t is the residual in eq 8 at time step t and y o t is the observed streamflow at time step t 3 5 approach in this study we compared the ensemble prediction performance of bma and vb lstm twenty conceptual hydrological models were adopted to reproduce the streamflow in the four catchments table 1 lists the periods of calibration and validation we utilized the previous year of the calibration period as a warm up period the shuffled compex evolution method sce ua duan et al 1993 calibrated each hydrological model with the objective function of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash sutcliffe 1970 ensemble predictions from the hydrological models were achieved with vb lstm and bma before applying vb lstm and bma we transformed the simulated streamflow produced by hydrological models with box cox transformation here vb lstm with one lstm layer and 30 hidden units was used to make predictions using full batch learning this means the svi algorithm had to estimate 6151 parameters of the lstm network while the input size is 20 note that the number of hidden units was manually chosen with the trial and error method the learning rate of adam is 0 003 the maximum training epoch is 50 000 we applied an early stopping technique bishop 2006 in vb lstm to avoid overfitting as the method is easy to be implemented the first 70 of calibration data were used to train vb lstm and the remaining calibration data were used to terminate the training progress other popular overfitting techniques like dropout srivastava et al 2014 and l2 regularization bishop 2006 cannot be directly applied to variational bayesian deep learning to evaluate the impacts of selected ensemble members we considered four scenarios of ensemble members in terms of hydrological models performances the nse values of 20 hydrological models during the calibration period were arranged in descending order then four scenarios a d were designed intuitively as follows a all twenty hydrological models are considered b good ensemble members consist of 5 hydrological models that have the best values of nse rankings 1 5 c medium ensemble members are the 5 hydrological models that have medium values of nse rankings 8 12 d poor ensemble members are the 5 worst performances of hydrological models rankings 16 20 4 results and discussion we compared the ensemble performances of vb lstm and bma in terms of their deterministic and probabilistic predictions the periods of calibration and validation are shown in table 1 twenty hydrological models were considered as the whole list of ensemble members we designed four scenarios a d differing in which member was considered into the ensemble list scenario a has all 20 members and the remaining scenarios b d only have 5 members with good medium and poor members according to their rank order of nse values respectively fig 3 shows the training progress of vb lstm made on the elbo for scenario a generally optimizing a standard lstm is performed on backpropagation and its loss function usually is the mean square error mse metric a standard lstm can provide point i e deterministic estimates but are poor at quantifying predictive uncertainty considering the proposed bayesian deep learning approach vb lstm the variational inference approach svi was used to estimate the uncertainty of large parameters in an lstm network elbo was the vb lstm s loss function and was optimized with gradient optimization over epochs a larger elbo means the variational distributions become closer to the true posterior distribution here the last 30 of the calibration period hereafter testing period was used to terminate the training progress of vb lstm this means we maximized the elbo over the testing period blue line in fig 3 with an early stopping technique the training was stopped while the maximum value of testing s elbo was not changed within 2000 epochs fig 3 illustrates the value of testing s elbo has plateaued to get maximum over epochs and thus the training is stopped besides the training epochs range from approximately 9500 to 16000 and the computing time varies from about 3 5 to 11 h in the four catchments compared with other catchments the shiquan catchment exhibits the least computing time as it has the fewest training epochs and shortest calibration period other scenarios have similar training progress and thus are not discussed here figs 4 and 5 show comparisons of deterministic predictions of vb lstm and bma for each catchment over the calibration and validation periods green circles in fig 4 indicate the hydrological models overall vb lstm exhibits better deterministic predictions than hydrological models and bma for all scenarios although the superiority has slight degradation in the validation period fig 4 presents taylor diagrams of comparison results taylor diagrams provide multiple assessments of model performances that combine three metrics pearson correlation coefficient rmse and standard deviation for each scenario it is demonstrated in fig 4 that the vb lstm tends to have higher correlations lower rmse and closer to the observational standard deviation in all catchments fig 5 illustrates the proposed approach exhibits lower mae than bma during calibration and validation periods by approximately 18 5 and 12 0 respectively trend lines for scenarios a to d are plotted in fig 5 to analyze the impacts of member selections for bma and vb lstm from the analysis of trend lines we can find that the trend lines of bma are steeper than those of vb lstm suggesting that bma is more easily impacted by the selection of ensemble members bma with good members tends to have lower mae than bma with poor members specifically for the bma scenario a containing all 20 members provides the lowest mae scenario b with good members has similar values of mae to scenario a scenario d with poor members exhibits the highest mae followed by scenario c with medium members compared with bma the trend lines of vb lstm are almost flat in most cases fig 5a1 a2 b1 c2 d1 and d2 thus vb lstm slightly improves the mae values in scenario a approximately 13 5 and 7 3 respectively in the calibration and validation but largely improves the mae values in scenario d approximately 31 9 and 23 0 respectively in the calibration and validation this indicates vb lstm can provide more robust and accurate deterministic predictions than bma although their performance becomes closer while the ensemble members are high quality the predictive qq plots and reliability over the validation period are illustrated in fig 6 fig 6 shows the predictive qq plots of vb lstm are more straight than those of bma in most cases suggesting that the vb lstm provides higher reliable probabilistic predictions specifically compared with bma the vb lstm significantly reduces the biases in the tangnaihai catchment and wushan catchment vb lstm and bma exhibit comparably reliable performance with similar linearity of predictive qq plots in the remaining catchments further reliability is used to measure the linearity of the predictive qq plots shown in fig 6a5 d5 it is demonstrated that the vb lstm provides higher values of reliability than bma in most cases although vb lstm provides slightly lower values of reliability in the tunxi catchment its predictions still can be considered comparably reliable as the values of its reliability are over 0 9 note that reliability or visualizing the predictive qq plots cannot give sufficient information on the predictive uncertainty thus sharpness and crps are calculated to complement other measures of predictive uncertainty figs 7 and 8 show sharpness and crps over calibration and validation periods in the four scenarios respectively similar conclusions can be reached as those of analyzing deterministic predictions above it is demonstrated that the vb lstm exhibits lower uncertainty estimates with smaller sharpness and crps than bma in most cases besides the sharpness and crps of the proposed approach are less impacted by the selection of members as their trendlines are flatter the performance of bma has a direct relationship with selections of members which can be concluded as scenario a b c d but the vb lstm does not show this relationship the performance of vb lstm is relatively stable in different scenarios in terms of sharpness the vb lstm has approximately 26 7 24 1 narrower prediction intervals on average than bma in the calibration validation period fig 7 in terms of crps it is approximately 23 6 14 1 lower on average than bma in the calibration validation period fig 8 note that in the wushan catchment scenario b of bma has a narrower sharpness shown in fig 7c2 but less reliability fig 6c5 over the validation period this means a sharp prediction does not imply reliable crps is an overall probabilistic performance score and can help us quantify predictive uncertainty further the crps of vb lstm in the wushan catchment is lower than that of bma overall the vb lstm has a better performance in probabilistic predictions for improving our understanding of a model s behavior fig 9 shows the importance of 20 ensemble members of vb lstm and bma in scenario a during the calibration period besides bma s weights nse and spearman correlation matrix of 20 members in four catchments are shown in fig 9 the order of a member for each catchment was sorted by the rank order of the member s weight of bma the importance of a member was measured via the pfi algorithm large importance represents the ensemble model s prediction heavily relies on this member note that deterministic and probabilistic predictions were assessed with different scores the probabilistic metric crps generalizes the mean absolute error mae which is a deterministic metric it will reduce to mae if predictions are deterministic gneiting raftery 2007 thus the crps can be used to have a direct comparison of deterministic and probabilistic predictions gneiting raftery 2007 here we used crps as a score function of the pfi algorithm to calculate the importance the weights of bma w k reflects the impacts of members on the bma s predictions their rank order is almost the same as that of importance columns 2 3 in fig 9 in addition the values of importance and weights are relatively close this indicates the importance is a useful alternative to interpret the bma the rank order of nse tends to be similar to that of the bma s weights but this is not a direct relationship columns 3 4 in fig 9 this can explain to some extent why scenario b good members of bma always has better performance than medium or poor members of bma i e scenarios c and d however the rank order of vb lstm s importance exhibits a big difference from that of bma s weights and nse columns 1 3 in fig 9 even a member that has a smaller value of nse than that of most members can have the highest importance in the vb lstm e g bucket model in the shiquan catchment and martine model in the wushan catchment this may reflect the fact that the members are highly correlated as shown in column 5 of fig 9 vb lstm can extract non linear relationships between variables thus it produced close results in different scenarios 5 summary and conclusions the multi model ensemble prediction is the main approach to reduce model structure uncertainty among various techniques bma is one of the most popular ensemble methods in hydrology actually bma performs soft model selection to find better members in the ensemble member list and average them this means that bma cannot be expected to do better when the true member i e close or same with observation does not lie in the ensemble member list hoege et al 2019 lakshminarayanan et al 2017 we proposed a regression based ensemble method vb lstm to improve streamflow predictions svi as an alternative to bayesian mcmc sampling was applied to provide a fast approximation of posterior distributions note that the detailed comparisons of svi and mcmc are beyond the scope of our research and can be seen in related literature wang and yeung 2016 results show that the proposed model mitigates the impacts of member selections and can combine the members to achieve a more powerful model that cannot be realized by bma this indicates that vb lstm with delicate structures and large numbers of parameters is able to capture non linearities and time dependencies to some extent the more significant the improvement the stronger the non linearities and time dependencies of extraction bma will be preferred in hydrological applications according to occam s razor i e the principle of parsimony if bma and vb lstm have similar predictive performance previous literature has shown bayesian approaches can avoid overfitting of deep learning to some extent as prior is a form of regularization e g gaussian prior is equivalent to l2 regularization ghahramani 2013 wang and yeung 2020 vb lstm may still exist overfitting due to a large number of parameters thus we applied an early stopping technique to avoid overfitting as the technique is easy to fit in a bayesian framework the importance estimated with pfi was used to interpret or reflect the impacts of ensemble members on vb lstm interpreting deep learning can help us understand the model s behaviors but it is still too hard to achieve accurate estimations now voosen 2017 beyond scope of our research pfi may help identify significant preditors before formulating a predictive model and complement other commonly used identification methods like partial information correlation pic sharma 2000 sharma mehrotra 2014 pfi algorithm used in this study is just one choice to interpret deep learning and other popular model agnostic methods like local interpretable model agnostic explanations lime ribeiro et al 2016 and shapley additive explanations shap lundberg lee 2017 can be tried in the future to investigate the impacts of member selections we applied bma and vb lstm to predict four catchments streamflows which considers four scenarios based on the performance of ensemble members vb lstm exhibits better deterministic predictions in terms of the taylor diagram and mae than bma the predictive qq plot and three assessment scores namely reliability sharpness and crps were employed to evaluate the performance of probabilistic predictions compared with bma the predictive qq plot and reliability shows vb lstm is more reliable and less biased smaller sharpness and crps show vb lstm produces less predictive uncertainty by comparing different scenarios results show vb lstm is more robust and is less impacted by member selections than bma in general only the results obtained for the validation period i e the out of sample results are of practical relevance this holds although results obtained for the calibration period i e in sample results are often reported in hydrological modeling works as we did in this study note that good medium and poor ensemble members were distinguished mandatorily with their nse values analysis of importance indicates vb lstm and bma rely on individual members to varying degrees this leads to their different model behaviors specifically bma with better ensemble members tends to have better deterministic and probabilistic predictions the reason may be that the importance of members for bma has a similar rank order with the nse of members this means high nse values of members may have high impacts on predictions and can result in good predictions for bma however vb lstm with better ensemble members sometimes produces not better predictions this is mainly because the importance of members for vb lstm has a different ranking order from the nse of members also high correlations between members may impact the vb lstm s predictions as vb lstm has a powerful ability to extract non linear patterns between variables our study encourages variational bayesian deep learning applied in hydrological ensemble predictions especially while there is a lack of good ensemble members four limitations may exist in our study the first one is that each training of vb lstm still consumes serval computing hours on a desktop computer instead of cpu gpu acceleration may be a promising way to greatly speed the training of vb lstm the second is that we manually calibrate the hyperparameters of vb lstm e g learning rate and numbers of hidden units with trial and error as high computational costs make autocalibration prohibitive the third limitation is that physically based distributed hydrological models such as mike she li et al 2019 refsgaard et al 2010 are not included in our ensemble member list the last limitation is that only four catchments are tested for the proposed method and bma in this study more generalized conclusions can be made through comparisons across a large number e g hundreds of sites boulesteix et al 2018 these limitations can be considered in future studies credit authorship contribution statement dayang li

to underestimate e s slope 0 02 r 2 0 004 and overestimate t r slope 1 51 r 2 0 78 compared to the observations the underestimations of e s by gleam may partly be due to the ignorance of soil

mainly consisted of three components plant transpiration t r soil evaporation e s and canopy interception e i among them t r is a biotic process regulated by plant stomatal activities granier et al 1999 kool et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 han et al 2018 while e i and e s are physical processes that directly convert the water from liquid to vapour by energy scott et al 2006 kool et al 2014 wang et al 2014 therefore accurate estimations of the total et and its components are important for us to understand the land atmosphere interactions water and energy balances and agricultural water demands newman et al 2006 lawrence et al 2007 wang and dickinson 2012 kool et al 2014 talsma et al 2018 at present the et and its components can be measured in situ by using different techniques such as eddy covariance systems stable isotope sap flow and micro lysimeters talsma et al 2018 berg and sheffield 2019 however large scale direct observations of the et components are still not available with the rapid developments in remote sensing over the recent four decades numerous et models have been developed to estimate regional or global et and its different components norman et al 1995 cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2007 2011 leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 fisher et al 2008 miralles et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 however many of the remote sensing based models lack a proper representation of the effects of soil moisture status on et and the performance of those models suffers when applied to water limited areas purdy et al 2018 chen et al 2020 for example the priestly taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl fisher et al 2008 model and the modis global evapotranspiration project mod16 mu et al 2011 model use the atmospheric moisture conditions i e air temperature relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit to represent the soil moisture constraints on et exceptionally the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 and simple terrestrial hydrosphere model sith zhu et al 2019 directly describe the soil moisture dynamics with reliance on the water balance equations and explicitly represent the control of soil water availability on et processes thus they are physically sound and rigorous and performed relatively good across different ecosystem types and environments purdy et al 2018 brust et al 2021 despite their relatively sound representations of associated hydrological processes there are still some insufficiencies in systematic inter comparisons and evaluations of their performances first the partitioning of et into its different components exhibited large divergences among the different models wang erlandsson et al 2014 miralles et al 2016 talsma et al 2018 berg and sheffield 2019 at present most previous studies mainly focus on evaluating the performance of the models in simulating the total et vinukollu et al 2011b ershadi et al 2014 miralles et al 2016 while researches on systematically comparing the performance of the different models in et partitioning across different biomes are still few or no existed second the remote sensing based models use different bio physiological stress functions to tune down the potential et to actual et fisher et al 2008 mu et al 2007 miralles et al 2011 zhu et al 2019 hence their performance in partitioning et are expected to differ over various land surface types and conditions however there are lack of systematic assessments on the uncertainties in et partitioning due to the model structures therefore a basis from which to choose a proper parameterization for the different et processes remains missing finally there are still great uncertainties in et partitioning across different sites and biomes and the seasonal variability of the model performances remains unclear to further improve the estimations of et and its components we compared and analyzed these two model s performances over a wide range of locations and biomes specifically the goals of this study were to i evaluate the performance of the models in simulating total et and its components with the filed observations ii analyze the spatial pattern similarities and differences of estimated et and its components by these two models and iii find out the uncertainties in total et and its components due to model structure 2 methods and data 2 1 et models in gleam and sith models the potential et is calculated using the priestley taylor pt equation priestley and taylor 1972 then is tuned down to actual et based on the stress factors such as soil moisture states and vegetation physiological characteristics the details of the two models were given below 2 1 1 gleam model gleam is a simple and widely used remote sensing based et model the total et mm day 1 mainly includes the transpiration t r mm day 1 from short e g grass and tall canopy vegetation e g trees soil evaporation e s mm day 1 from bare soil and interception e i mm day 1 from tall vegetation miralles et al 2011 in gleam each grid contains three land covers of short vegetation tall vegetation and bare soil the total et of the grid is the sum of the actual evaporation from each of the three surface types weighted by their fractional coverage the interception is calculated separately using the gash model gash 1979 valente et al 1997 e s and t r are calculated using a series of stress factors to constrain the pt potential evapotranspiration expressing as the following equations 1 e s r s s s α s δ λ δ γ r n s g s 2 t r r sc s sc α sc δ λ δ γ r n sc g sc r tc s tc α tc δ λ

water from liquid to water vapour in a constant pressure and temperature process γ is the psychrometric constant 0 066 kpa 1 which is the ratio of specific heat of moist air at constant pressure to latent heat of vaporization of water r s r sc and r tc are the fractions of bare soil short vegetation and tall vegetation in each pixel respectively α is the pt coefficient priestley and taylor 1972

net radiation in gleam and β is the interception constant 0 07 which is used to avoid the double counting of evaporation from wet canopy gash and stewart 1977 in gleam the stress factors are parameterized separately for tall canopies s tc short vegetation s sc and bare soil s s which are the function of the soil moisture and the vegetation water content i e vegetation optical depth unitless vod the stress factors for the tall vegetation and short vegetation are calculated as 3 s tc o r s sc vod vo d max 1 θ c θ w θ c θ wp 2 where vodmax is the maximum vod for a specific pixel θ

m3 m 3 in addition the stress factor for bare soil s s is calculated based on surface soil water states 4 s s 1 θ c θ 1 θ c θ r where θr is the residual soil moisture m3 m 3 and θ 1 is the surface soil moisture m3 m 3 2 1 2 sith model following the scheme of the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum sith model proposed by zhu et al 2019 is a relatively new satellite based et model at daily temporal resolution in sith model the total et is the sum of vegetation transpiration soil evaporation and canopy interception evaporation the source of water for soil evaporation is constrained to occur in the first soil layer while its for plant transpiration comes from both two soil layers and groundwater for the interception loss rainfalls intercepted by the canopy are evaporated at the potential rate these can be described as 5 e i f wet α δ δ γ r nc λ 6 e s f sm α δ δ γ r ns g λ 7 t r g 1 f wet f t i 1 n t p g i 8 t s i 1 f wet f sm i f t t p s i 9 t r t s i t r g where i is the soil layer i 1 2 the α is set to 1 26 in sith rnc and rns w m 2 are the net radiation distributed into the canopy and surface soil respectively tp s i and tp g i mm day 1 are respectively the potential transpiration from soil water and groundwater in the ith layer which are calculated using the pt potential et by taking the vertical distributions of plant roots and the position of groundwater table into accounts see details in zhu et al 2019 ts i and tr g mm day 1 are the actual transpiration from the soil of the ith layer and groundwater respectively fwet is the relative

used to represent the model performance including the slope of the regression line slope the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse the relative error re and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse generally the r 2 value of linear regression between simulations and observations greater than 0 5 is considered as acceptable performance the rmse shows the magnitude and variance in error between observed and simulated values ranging from 0 to the re is defined as the ratio of rmse to the mean values of observed data the nse is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance when the nse values is closer to 1 the simulation is better the rmse re and nse were computed as 13 rmse 1 n t 1

values 2 3 data 2 3 1 model forcing data the inputs variables of the sith include leaf area index lai net radiation rn air temperature ta precipitation pre air pressure pa and land cover lc here we used input datasets for lai from globmap lai for 1982 to 2017 liu et al 2012 the globmap lai is generated in 8 km and 16 day 8 day resolution produced by using advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite data and it can be accessed from http www globalmapping org similar to gleam we also selected the latest era 5 datasets as the forcing data hersbach and dee 2016 this datasets span from 1982 to 2017 at a 0 25 spatial resolution and an hour temporal resolution and are produced by european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf https cds climate copernicus eu in addition the static land cover data from mcd12c1 in 2001 was used as one of inputs friedl et al 2010 because its changes were relatively small at a global scale over time zhang et al 2016 because the input datasets vary in spatial resolution we resampled them to a common 0 25 spatial resolution before using them as the forcing values in addition we performed temporal interpolation for lai data set based on the nearest interpolation method to obtain daily data for the pixels 2 3 2 validation data for site scale comparisons we selected a total of 46 flux sites from the fluxnet database https fluxnet fluxdata org to evaluate the performances of two models in et simulations for the purpose of validation each flux site meets the following criteria 1 more than one years of daily data available not gap fill eddy covariance data 2 mostly homogeneous land cover at 1 km radius from the flux tower checked with google earth and the land cover at sites location matches with its in mcd12c1 3 daily energy balance closure ranging from 0 70 to 0 95 supplementary fig s1 these 46 sites can be divided into 9 different vegetation types evergreen needleleaf forests enf 5 sites evergreen broadleaf forests ebf 6 sites deciduous broadleaf forests dbf 7 sites mixed forests mf 5 sites grasslands gra 7 sites croplands cro 6 sites savannas sav 3 sites wooden savannas wsa 3 sites and shrublands shr 4 sites the map of all sites location and detailed information of all sites are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively in addition filed observations of the different components of et transpiration soil evaporation and interception were collected from published literatures see details in table 2 noticeably only one or two components of et were directed measured at most sites and the others were calculated by models using observed meteorological data or water balance methods here only the direct measurements of the et components were used for model performance comparisons for regional scale comparison the water balanced et datasets wb et for 32 major i e 200 000 km2 catchments produced by pan et al 2012 were used to evaluate the model performance at catchment scales this datasets were widely used to evaluate model performance at regional scale li et al 2013 wang et al 2015 which include monthly precipitation et streamflow and the change in water storage from 1984 to 2006 the detailed information of 32 catchments were given in supplementary table s1 chen et al 2020 in addition the model tree ensembles mte product jung et al 2009 which spans from 1982 2011 at monthly temporal and 0 5 spatial resolutions was used for to evaluate the model performances at tropical rainforest the mte product is generated by using the machine learning algorithm based on the et observations from the fluxnet data and remote sensing and meteorological data all input and validation datasets are summarized in supplementary table s2 3 results 3 1 performances of two models in total et simulations at multiple scales the five selected statistical measures slope r 2 rmse re and nse are used to evaluate the performance of two models at the 46 selected sites fig 2 and 32 catchments fig 3 at site scale the average slopes between the simulated and observed et ranged from 0 75 gra to 1 05 mf for sith and from 0 69 gra to 1 12 enf for gleam respectively the sith and gleam displayed a similar range of mean rmse values across all biomes sith rmse 0 59 0 90 mm day 1 gleam rmse 0 64 0 93 mm day 1 the average values of re ranged from 0 30 shr to 0 66 enf for sith and from 0 34 shr to 0 75 mf for gleam in addition the average values of r 2 ranged from 0 46 wsa to 0 77 mf for sith and from 0 34 ebf to 0 70 shr for gleam the sith produced slightly higher mean r 2 values than that for gleam at most biomes except for the sav and wsa noticeably relatively low r 2 value for gleam were found at ebf sites from 0 004 to 0 51 indicating a poor consistency between the simulated and observed et at these sites finally the average nse values for sith were greater than 0 over all biomes 0 08 0 65 which shows a greater consistency with the observed et however the mean nse values produced by gleam were lower than 0 over some biomes especially at ebf biome nse 0 23 at regional scale fig 3 the slopes of regression between simulated et by the two models and the estimated wb et were close to 1 at most basins nevertheless its slope values were obviously higher than 1 at some catchments i e changjiang huang niger nile and yukon and lower than 0 5 at amazon and congo basins the r 2 values for both models were higher than 0 6 except for some basins in tropic areas with r 2 values less than 0 35 i e amazon congo and mekong basins generally the sith produced a slightly higher r 2 values than that of gleam at all basins in addition the values of rmse for sith were lower than that for gleam in most basins with the exceptions of congo mekong zhujiang changjiang indus and nile the re values for sith were slightly lower than that of gleam which ranged from 0 10 amazon to 1 80 yukong for sith and from 0 10 amazon to 2 04 indigirk for gleam the nse values for sith were slightly greater than that for gleam at most basins and two models generated nse values greater than 0 except for the basins in tropicals yukon and indigirk 3 2 the seasonal variations of et in two models at different scales we further analyzed the seasonal variations of et from the two models at 46 sites generally it was found that the seasonal patterns of et were well captured by the two models at all sites the selected 24 sites shown in supplementary fig s2 however at br sa1 site the seasonal variations of et estimations by gleam showed difference with that of observations fig 4 in addition to br sa1 site we also selected the br sa3 site 3 02 s 54 97 w from fluxnet data and k34 site 2 60 s 60 20 w in the literature of da rocha et al 2009 to further analyze the seasonal patterns of et in tropical rainforest the data at br sa3 site in 2002 and 2004 and k34 from 1999 to 2006 were collected in this study the mean annual precipitation over these sites were large 2701 mm year 1 for br sa1 1569 mm year 1 for br sa3 and 2286 mm year 1 for k34 interestingly the observed et at three sites in the dry seasons were higher than that in wet seasons the seasonal variations of observed et at three sites were consistent with that of net radiation and temperature but contrary to that of precipitation fig 4 we found that the seasonal patterns of simulated et by sith were generally consistent with that of the observed et at the three sites on the contrary the seasonal patterns of simulated et by gleam at these sites were different from that of observations with high values in wet seasons and low values in dry seasons in addition we also compared the different components of et from two models at these sites fig 4 it was found that during the wet seasons the interception loss and transpiration simulated by gleam were obviously higher than that simulated by sith during dry seasons the performances of the two models were comparable in the partitioning of et at these sites in addition long term monthly average et from 1984 to 2006 in sith and gleam versus the estimated wb et at 32 catchments were shown in fig 5 the seasonal patterns of estimated et by sith and gleam were basically consistent with that of wb et at most of basins with high values in local summer and low values in local winter however the simulated monthly average et by the two models showed poor agreement with the estimated wb et over the basins in tropical regions i e amazon congo and mekong basins in addition the estimated et by sith and gleam were slightly higher than the monthly average wb et at some basins especially in nile indigirk and yukon basins 3 3 performances of two models in the partitioning of et at multiple scales the estimated et and its components by the two models against the filed measurements at each site were shown in fig 6 generally the performances of the two models in simulating total et were similar the slope of linear regression between observed and simulated et was 0 99 and 1 05 for sith and gleam respectively the values of r 2 were relatively high for the two models being 0 84 and 0 80 for sith and gleam respectively fig 6d however the performances of the two models exhibited great differences in et partitioning the slopes of linear regression between observed and simulated transpiration were 0 98 and 1 51 for sith and gleam respectively suggesting that gleam tended to overestimate transpiration nevertheless gleam produced a higher values of r 2 for transpiration than sith sith r 2 0 51 gleam r 2 0 78 fig 6c additionally the soil evaporation was significantly underestimated by gleam with low values of the linear regression slope 0 02 and r 2 0 004 on the contrary the sith performed relatively well in simulating soil evaporation slope 0 76 and r 2 0 62 fig 6a for interception we found that the two models tended to underestimate it with the values of regression slopes lower than 1 0 40 and 0 55 for sith and gleam respectively despite with relatively high r 2 0 95 and 0 83 for sith and gleam respectively fig 6b the spatial patterns of mean annual et and its different components estimated by sith and gleam were shown in fig 7 and the fractions of transpiration soil evaporation and interception in total et of the two models were shown in fig 8 the transpiration was the dominant component accounting for 0 67 and 0 76 of total et for sith and gleam respectively the estimated transpiration by gleam was generally higher than that by sith and thus the ratios of transpiration to et that is t r et of gleam were apparently higher than that of sith at most regions especially in low vegetation cover regions i e shrublands and grasslands generally low e s values were estimated by these two models over dense vegetation areas and high e s values over biomes with low vegetation covers however the simulated soil evaporation and the ratio of soil evaporation to et that is e s et by sith 0 25 were significantly higher than that estimated by gleam 0 09 finally the ratios of interception to et that is e i et by gleam 0 15 was slightly higher than that by sith 0 08 although the two models exhibited a consistent spatial distribution we also compared the performance of those two models in partitioning et across different biomes table 3 the average t r et ratios across different biomes estimated by gleam exhibited a relatively narrow range varying from 0 60 enf to 0 85 cro on the contrary the t r et ratios estimated by sith showed large variations across different vegetation types ranging from 0 32 osh to 0 80 wsa generally the t r et ratios estimated by gleam were clearly higher than that by sith over the shr gra and cro biomes 0 64 0 85 for gleam and 0 32 0 64 for sith the e s et ratios estimated by gleam were lower than that estimated by sith across all biomes 0 01 0 30 for gleam and 0 04 0 67 for sith noticeably it is expected that the e s et ratios over biomes with low vegetation covers should be high however the estimated e s et ratios over these biomes by gleam were relatively low 0 12 0 30 and the estimated e s et ratios by sith seemed to in reasonable ranges 0 48 0 67 the estimated e i et ratios for two models were high in forests especially at tropical rainforest and low in non forest regions nevertheless the estimated e i et ratios by gleam were slightly higher than sith across all biomes ranging from 0 03 to 0 29 for gleam and from 0 01 to 0 21 for sith respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the global land et anomalies in el niño and la niña events it has been well documented that the et over tropical rainforest was mainly determined by the energy rather than precipitation nemani et al 2003 jung et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 baker et al 2021 thus increased radiation in dry seasons can produce greater et than in wet seasons fig 4 however the seasonal variations in et estimated by gleam were quite different from the observations thus it seems that gleam can not properly capture the dynamics of et in response to climate perturbations across the tropics to verify our hypothesis we analyzed inter annual variability of et fig 9 and meteorological variables fig 10 during typical el niño i e 1987 1992 1994 and 2002 and la niña years i e 1999 2000 2010 and 2011 the spatial patterns of et estimated by gleam across tropics were significantly different from that estimated by sith and mte product during el niño years negative et anomalies were found by gleam across the tropics while positive anomalies were observed by sith and mte during la niña years the results were contrary to the above fig 9 in addition the spatial patterns of et anomalies by sith and mte are basically consistent with that of net radiation anomalies while these by gleam displayed an agreement with that of precipitation in el niño and la niña years figs 9 and 10 recently purdy et al 2018 also found increases in et across the tropics during el niño years by using an updated pt jpl et algorithm yan et al 2013 noticed that positive et anomalies in el niño years and negative et anomalies in la niña years were occurred in tropics and its spatial distribution was also consistent with potential et contrary to that of precipitation moreover guan et al 2015 found that when annual rainfall was greater than 2000 mm year 1 the tropical rainforest can utilize the water storage from the wet season to satisfy the plant water demand thus these two models exhibited contrasting behaviors and further exploration into the controlling mechanisms of et are still needed across these regions 4 2 the uncertainty of model structure in et partitioning generally the daily variations of estimated et by the two models showed a good consistency with the observations thus these two models performed well in response to the changes in environmental factors supplementary fig s3 however they exhibited great differences in et partitioning due to differences in model structure and parameterization the estimated soil evaporation by gleam was significantly lower than observations with relatively low regression slope and r 2 on the contrary sith performed relatively well in simulations of soil evaporation with regression slope close to 1 and relatively high r 2 fig 4 in the two models soil evaporation was constrained to occur only in the upper soil layer and was tuned down to actual values by using similar stress functions eqs 4 and 12 for gleam and sith respectively the main differences between them may be due to the spatial grid representation of the et processes in the gleam model soil evaporation under the tall and short canopy was ignored and only takes the portion of bare soil in each grid into account eqs 1 and 2 for the vegetation with low leaf area index the soil evaporation under the vegetation canopy often contributed a significant portion of total et black and kelliher 1989 baldocchi and meyers 1991 barbour et al 2005 unsworth et al 2004 thus the underestimation of soil evaporation from gleam may occur in vegetated regions especially over biomes with low vegetation covers i e shrublands and grasslands both models used soil water content as one of the stress factor to limit the potential transpiration as the source of water for transpiration mainly comes from the soil incorporating soil water content into the algorithms of transpiration can improve the model performances federer et al 2003 maurer et al 2002 de jeu et al 2008 purdy et al 2018 brust et al 2021 however these two models adopted different stress factors to reflect the vegetation state such as plant temperature eq 11 for sith and vegetation optical depth eq 3 for gleam however the stress factor using temperature f t eq 11 by sith may not well capture the actual vegetation state during the whole growing stages on the contrary vod can reflect the plant water status as well as photosynthetic activity and thus provides a dynamic information on vegetation state woodhouse 2005 liu et al 2013 de jeu et al 2008 miralles et al 2011 therefore gleam can better capture the dynamic features of transpiration than sith fig 6 in addition in regions with sufficient water supply et was mainly determined by the atmospheric moisture demand i e net radiation and vapour pressure deficit which are often closely related with temperature jung et al 2010 thus the poor performances of gleam in energy limited regions such as tropical rainforest may be due to the absence of stress factors of atmospheric moisture demand which usually highly correlated with temperature for sith the overestimated et in these regions may be due to the unconsidered influences of vegetation states on et eq 11 therefore the stresses on transpiration should take the available soil moisture vegetation state and atmospheric moisture demand into accounts interception loss is the process of the rainfall intercepted and stored by canopy and subsequently lost by evaporation from the canopy thus interception loss is strongly correlates with the amount of precipitation and canopy state pypker et al 2005 zheng and jia 2020 although the estimated e i by the two models showed a high correlation with field observations these two models clearly underestimated interception loss especially the sith model generally gleam provided a slightly better estimates of e i than sith up to date filed observations of interception have been widely conducted however these were mainly concentrated on forest ecosystems with few observations in sparse vegetation miralles et al 2010 zheng and jia 2020 therefore the specific source of uncertainty of two models in interception estimates was still unknown and more filed observations are needed to understand mechanism of interception loss over sparse vegetation 4 3 partitioning of et into three components recently researches on the t r et ratio had attracted much attentions for examples jasechko et al 2013 reported that the transpiration accounted about 0 80 0 90 of et based on isotope analysis across the global large basins taking the uncertainties of the isotopic data into accounts coenders gerrits et al 2014 reported that the t r et ratio ranged from 0 35 to 0 80 good et al 2015 estimated the ratios of t r et being 0 64 0 13 based on atmospheric vapour isotope measurements and isotope mass budget by compiling 81 filed observations schlesinger and jasechko 2104 reported that the ratio of t r et was about 0 61 0 15 the results from land surface models had shown that the ratio of t r et was only 0 43 and was argued to be underestimated lawrence et al 2007 2011 wang erlandsson et al 2014 berg and sheffield 2019 using the observations to constrain the land surface models lian et al 2018 increased the estimated t r et ratios from 0 41 0 11 to 0 62 0 0 6 recently a global mean ratio of t r et was estimated to be 0 57 0 07 based on 108 ensemble members from the combination of models and lai observed regression wei et al 2017 in addition many remote sensing based models pml and pt jpl estimated that the ratios of t r et ranged from 0 54 to 0 65 purdy et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 these indicated that the estimated t r et ratio by sith 0 67 was closer to reported values than that estimated by gleam 0 76 the overestimation of t r et ratio for gleam mainly occurred in gra 0 79 cro 0 85 and csh 0 78 compared with the mean t r et values being around 0 51 0 15 across these biome in previous studies lauenroth and bradford 2006 alton et al 2009 schlesinger and jasechko 2104 wang erlandsson et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 gu et al 2018 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2021 at global the e s et ratio in sith 0 25 was greater than gleam 0 09 and the e i et ratio in sith 0 08 was lower than gleam 0 15 at present the model based global mean e s et ratios were estimated to range from 0 24 to 0 52 miralles et al 2016 purdy et al 2018 dirmeyer et al 2005 berg and sheffield 2019 these results may indicate that gleam tended to underestimate the ratios of e s et over low vegetation regions relative low e s et ratios were estimated by gleam i e 0 14 for gra and 0 12 for csh however direct observations showed that soil evaporation may account 0 50 of total et compared over these regions wang erlandsson et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 for canopy interception the global mean e i et ratios were generally estimated ranging from 0 10 to 0 24 dirmeyer et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 miralles et al 2016 these results indicate that sith slightly underestimated the e s et ratio however the exact ratios of soil evaporation and canopy interception to et at global scale are still lack 5 conclusion using remote sensing et models for gleam and sith based on the priestley taylor equation this study systematically evaluated et partitioning and the uncertainty of et partitioning in the model structure in general both two models in et simulations performed well at different scales except the poor performance of gleam occurring in tropical rainforest lack of the stress of atmospheric moisture demand on transpiration in gleam lead to the overestimation of et in wet seasons at tropical rainforest as for the et partitioning the overestimated transpiration and slightly underestimated interception were occurred in gleam and modeled soil evaporation showed poor performance with the filed observations comparing with the observations the sith performed relatively well in simulating soil evaporation and underestimated interception the modeled transpiration in sith provided a lower correlation with observations than gleam owing to plant temperature limitation cannot reflect actual vegetation state in addition the t r et ratio in gleam was 0 76 with values higher than that of sith 0 67 and previous studies central mean value around 0 60 and the e s et values in gleam 0 09 was clearly lower than sith 0 25 and other modeled values due to neglecting the soil evaporation under short and tall vegetation results in the clearly overestimated t r et ratio and underestimated e s et in gleam occurred over low vegetation covers with t r et and e s et values ranging from 0 64 to 0 85 and from 0 07 to 0 30 respectively the modeled e i et ratio in sith 0 08 was slightly lower than gleam 0 15 the different scheme of parameterization of evaporation stress factors results in the different performance of models at et partitioning in this study we figure out the source of uncertainties of two models in et partitioning therefore improvements of et partitioning still needs more

3829,accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et and the partitioning of et into transpiration t r soil evaporation e s and interception e i is critical to understand water cycle and land atmosphere feedback in this study we evaluated the performances of two remote sensing based et models at multiple scales and analyzed the uncertainties in et partitioning due to the model structures these two models were simple terrestrial hydrosphere model sith developed by our team and the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam as far as et were concerned the two models exhibited relatively good performances at different scales however it was found that gleam performed relatively poor at evergreen broadleaf forest r 2 0 34 rmse 0 87 mm day 1 nse 0 28 in addition the seasonal pattern of simulated et by gleam at the tropical rainforest was not consistent with the observations furthermore great discrepancies in et partitioning were observed between the two models generally gleam tended to underestimate e s slope 0 02 r 2 0 004 and overestimate t r slope 1 51 r 2 0 78 compared to the observations the underestimations of e s by gleam may partly be due to the ignorance of soil evaporation under vegetation canopy on the contrary sith displayed relatively good performances in estimations of e s slope 0 76 r 2 0 62 and t r slope 0 98 r 2 0 51 however both of the two models failed to properly simulate e i although gleam slope 0 55 r 2 0 83 performed slightly better than sith slope 0 40 r 2 0 95 global multi year average ratios of t r e s and e i to et for gleam and sith were 0 76 0 09 0 15 and 0 67 0 25 0 08 respectively in future studies it is important to investigate direct observations on different components of et especially on the interception to improve our understanding on the et processes keywords evapotranspiration partitioning interception soil evaporation transpiration 1 introduction as a key part of global water cycle evapotranspiration et is a critical nexus between terrestrial water carbon and surface energy exchanges oki and kanae 2006 trenberth et al 2009 vinukollu et al 2011a wang and dickinson 2012 kool et al 2014 in general et is mainly consisted of three components plant transpiration t r soil evaporation e s and canopy interception e i among them t r is a biotic process regulated by plant stomatal activities granier et al 1999 kool et al 2014 kumar et al 2018 han et al 2018 while e i and e s are physical processes that directly convert the water from liquid to vapour by energy scott et al 2006 kool et al 2014 wang et al 2014 therefore accurate estimations of the total et and its components are important for us to understand the land atmosphere interactions water and energy balances and agricultural water demands newman et al 2006 lawrence et al 2007 wang and dickinson 2012 kool et al 2014 talsma et al 2018 at present the et and its components can be measured in situ by using different techniques such as eddy covariance systems stable isotope sap flow and micro lysimeters talsma et al 2018 berg and sheffield 2019 however large scale direct observations of the et components are still not available with the rapid developments in remote sensing over the recent four decades numerous et models have been developed to estimate regional or global et and its different components norman et al 1995 cleugh et al 2007 mu et al 2007 2011 leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 fisher et al 2008 miralles et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 zhu et al 2019 however many of the remote sensing based models lack a proper representation of the effects of soil moisture status on et and the performance of those models suffers when applied to water limited areas purdy et al 2018 chen et al 2020 for example the priestly taylor jet propulsion laboratory pt jpl fisher et al 2008 model and the modis global evapotranspiration project mod16 mu et al 2011 model use the atmospheric moisture conditions i e air temperature relative humidity and vapour pressure deficit to represent the soil moisture constraints on et exceptionally the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam miralles et al 2011 and simple terrestrial hydrosphere model sith zhu et al 2019 directly describe the soil moisture dynamics with reliance on the water balance equations and explicitly represent the control of soil water availability on et processes thus they are physically sound and rigorous and performed relatively good across different ecosystem types and environments purdy et al 2018 brust et al 2021 despite their relatively sound representations of associated hydrological processes there are still some insufficiencies in systematic inter comparisons and evaluations of their performances first the partitioning of et into its different components exhibited large divergences among the different models wang erlandsson et al 2014 miralles et al 2016 talsma et al 2018 berg and sheffield 2019 at present most previous studies mainly focus on evaluating the performance of the models in simulating the total et vinukollu et al 2011b ershadi et al 2014 miralles et al 2016 while researches on systematically comparing the performance of the different models in et partitioning across different biomes are still few or no existed second the remote sensing based models use different bio physiological stress functions to tune down the potential et to actual et fisher et al 2008 mu et al 2007 miralles et al 2011 zhu et al 2019 hence their performance in partitioning et are expected to differ over various land surface types and conditions however there are lack of systematic assessments on the uncertainties in et partitioning due to the model structures therefore a basis from which to choose a proper parameterization for the different et processes remains missing finally there are still great uncertainties in et partitioning across different sites and biomes and the seasonal variability of the model performances remains unclear to further improve the estimations of et and its components we compared and analyzed these two model s performances over a wide range of locations and biomes specifically the goals of this study were to i evaluate the performance of the models in simulating total et and its components with the filed observations ii analyze the spatial pattern similarities and differences of estimated et and its components by these two models and iii find out the uncertainties in total et and its components due to model structure 2 methods and data 2 1 et models in gleam and sith models the potential et is calculated using the priestley taylor pt equation priestley and taylor 1972 then is tuned down to actual et based on the stress factors such as soil moisture states and vegetation physiological characteristics the details of the two models were given below 2 1 1 gleam model gleam is a simple and widely used remote sensing based et model the total et mm day 1 mainly includes the transpiration t r mm day 1 from short e g grass and tall canopy vegetation e g trees soil evaporation e s mm day 1 from bare soil and interception e i mm day 1 from tall vegetation miralles et al 2011 in gleam each grid contains three land covers of short vegetation tall vegetation and bare soil the total et of the grid is the sum of the actual evaporation from each of the three surface types weighted by their fractional coverage the interception is calculated separately using the gash model gash 1979 valente et al 1997 e s and t r are calculated using a series of stress factors to constrain the pt potential evapotranspiration expressing as the following equations 1 e s r s s s α s δ λ δ γ r n s g s 2 t r r sc s sc α sc δ λ δ γ r n sc g sc r tc s tc α tc δ λ

water from liquid to water vapour in a constant pressure and temperature process γ is the psychrometric constant 0 066 kpa 1 which is the ratio of specific heat of moist air at constant pressure to latent heat of vaporization of water r s r sc and r tc are the fractions of bare soil short vegetation and tall vegetation in each pixel respectively α is the pt coefficient priestley and taylor 1972 and is set respectively to 1 26 1 26 and 0 80 for bare soil α s short vegetation α sc and tall vegetation α tc in gleam r n s r n tc and r n sc w m 2 are the net radiation intercepted by bare soil short vegetation and tall vegetation respectively g s g sc and g tc w m 2 are the soil heat flux for the fraction of bare soil short vegetation and tall vegetation respectively being as fractions of net radiation in gleam and β is the interception constant 0 07 which is used to avoid the double counting of evaporation from wet canopy gash and stewart 1977 in gleam the stress factors are parameterized separately for tall canopies s tc short vegetation s sc and bare soil s s which are the function of the soil moisture and the vegetation water content i e vegetation optical depth unitless vod the stress factors for the tall vegetation and short vegetation are calculated as 3 s tc o r s sc vod vo d max 1 θ c θ w θ c θ wp 2 where vodmax is the maximum vod for a specific pixel θ c m3 m 3 is the critical soil moisture below which plants start to endure water stress θ w m3 m 3 is the soil moisture content of the wettest layer and θwp is soil moisture at permanent wilting point m3 m 3 in addition the stress factor for bare soil s s is calculated based on surface soil water states 4 s s 1 θ c θ 1 θ c θ r where θr is the residual soil moisture m3 m 3 and θ 1 is the surface soil moisture m3 m 3 2 1 2 sith model following the scheme of the groundwater soil plant atmosphere continuum sith model proposed by zhu et al 2019 is a relatively new satellite based et model at daily temporal resolution in sith model the total et is the sum of vegetation transpiration soil evaporation and canopy interception evaporation the source of water for soil evaporation is constrained to occur in the first soil layer while its for plant transpiration comes from both two soil layers and groundwater for the interception loss rainfalls intercepted by the canopy are evaporated at the potential rate these can be described as 5 e i f wet α δ δ γ r nc λ 6 e s f sm α δ δ γ r ns g λ 7 t r g 1 f wet f t i 1 n t p g i 8 t s i 1 f wet f sm i f t t p s i 9 t r t s i t r g where i is the soil layer i 1 2 the α is set to 1 26 in sith rnc and rns w m 2 are the net radiation distributed into the canopy and surface soil respectively tp s i and tp g i mm day 1 are respectively the potential transpiration from soil water and groundwater in the ith layer which are calculated using the pt potential et by taking the vertical distributions of plant roots and the position of groundwater table into accounts see details in zhu et al 2019 ts i and tr g mm day 1 are the actual transpiration from the soil of the ith layer and groundwater respectively fwet is the relative surface wetness unitless which is fraction of day time consumed by wet canopy evaporation ft is the plant temperature constraint unitless fsm i is the soil moisture constraint unitless of the ith soil

used to represent the model performance including the slope of the regression line slope the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse the relative error re and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse generally the r 2 value of linear regression between simulations and observations greater than 0 5 is considered as acceptable performance the rmse shows the magnitude and variance in error between observed and simulated values ranging from 0 to the re is defined as the ratio of rmse to the mean values of observed data the nse is a normalized statistic that determines the relative magnitude of the residual variance compared to the measured data variance when the nse values is closer to 1 the simulation is better the rmse re and nse were computed as 13 rmse 1 n t 1

values 2 3 data 2 3 1 model forcing data the inputs variables of the sith include leaf area index lai net radiation rn air temperature ta precipitation pre air pressure pa and land cover lc here we used input datasets for lai from globmap lai for 1982 to 2017 liu et al 2012 the globmap lai is generated in 8 km and 16 day 8 day resolution produced by using advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis satellite data and it can be accessed from http www globalmapping org similar to gleam we also selected the latest era 5 datasets as the forcing data hersbach and dee 2016 this datasets span from 1982 to 2017 at a 0 25 spatial resolution and an hour temporal resolution and are produced by european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf https cds climate copernicus eu in addition the static land cover data from mcd12c1 in 2001 was used as one of inputs friedl et al 2010 because its changes were relatively small at a global scale over time zhang et al 2016 because the input datasets vary in spatial resolution we resampled them to a common 0 25 spatial resolution before using them as the forcing values in addition we performed temporal interpolation for lai data set based on the nearest interpolation method to obtain daily data for the pixels 2 3 2 validation data for site scale comparisons we selected a total of 46 flux sites from the fluxnet database https fluxnet fluxdata org to evaluate the performances of two models in et simulations for the purpose of validation each flux site meets the following criteria 1 more than one years of daily data available not gap fill eddy covariance data 2 mostly homogeneous land cover at 1 km radius from the flux tower checked with google earth and the land cover at sites location matches with its in mcd12c1 3 daily energy balance closure ranging from 0 70 to 0 95 supplementary fig s1 these 46 sites can be divided into 9 different vegetation types evergreen needleleaf forests enf 5 sites evergreen broadleaf forests ebf 6 sites deciduous broadleaf forests dbf 7 sites mixed forests mf 5 sites grasslands gra 7 sites croplands cro 6 sites savannas sav 3 sites wooden savannas wsa 3 sites and shrublands shr 4 sites the map of all sites location and detailed information of all sites are shown in fig 1 and table 1 respectively in addition filed observations of the different components of et transpiration soil evaporation and interception were collected from published literatures see details in table 2 noticeably only one or two components of et were directed measured at most sites and the others were calculated by models using observed meteorological data or water balance methods here only the direct measurements of the et components were used for model performance comparisons for regional scale comparison the water balanced et datasets wb et for 32 major i e 200 000 km2 catchments produced by pan et al 2012 were used to evaluate the model performance at catchment scales this datasets were widely used to evaluate model performance at regional scale li et al 2013 wang et al 2015 which include monthly precipitation et streamflow and the change in water storage from 1984 to 2006 the detailed information of 32 catchments were given in supplementary table s1 chen et al 2020 in addition the model tree ensembles mte product jung et al 2009 which spans from 1982 2011 at monthly temporal and 0 5 spatial resolutions was used for to evaluate the model performances at tropical rainforest the mte product is generated by using the machine learning algorithm based on the et observations from the fluxnet data and remote sensing and meteorological data all input and validation datasets are summarized in supplementary table s2 3 results 3 1 performances of two models in total et simulations at multiple scales the five selected statistical measures slope r 2 rmse re and nse are used to evaluate the performance of two models at the 46 selected sites fig 2 and 32 catchments fig 3 at site scale the average slopes between the simulated and observed et ranged from 0 75 gra to 1 05 mf for sith and from 0 69 gra to 1 12 enf for gleam respectively the sith and gleam displayed a similar range of mean rmse values across all biomes sith rmse 0 59 0 90 mm day 1 gleam rmse 0 64 0 93 mm day 1 the average values of re ranged from 0 30 shr to 0 66 enf for sith and from 0 34 shr to 0 75 mf for gleam in addition the average values of r 2 ranged from 0 46 wsa to 0 77 mf for sith and from 0 34 ebf to 0 70 shr for gleam the sith produced slightly higher mean r 2 values than that for gleam at most biomes except for the sav and wsa noticeably relatively low r 2 value for gleam were found at ebf sites from 0 004 to 0 51 indicating a poor consistency between the simulated and observed et at these sites finally the average nse values for sith were greater than 0 over all biomes 0 08 0 65 which shows a greater consistency with the observed et however the mean nse values produced by gleam were lower than 0 over some biomes especially at ebf biome nse 0 23 at regional scale fig 3 the slopes of regression between simulated et by the two models and the estimated wb et were close to 1 at most basins nevertheless its slope values were obviously higher than 1 at some catchments i e changjiang huang niger nile and yukon and lower than 0 5 at amazon and congo basins the r 2 values for both models were higher than 0 6 except for some basins in tropic areas with r 2 values less than 0 35 i e amazon congo and mekong basins generally the sith produced a slightly higher r 2 values than that of gleam at all basins in addition the values of rmse for sith were lower than that for gleam in most basins with the exceptions of congo mekong zhujiang changjiang indus and nile the re values for sith were slightly lower than that of gleam which ranged from 0 10 amazon to 1 80 yukong for sith and from 0 10 amazon to 2 04 indigirk for gleam the nse values for sith were slightly greater than that for gleam at most basins and two models generated nse values greater than 0 except for the basins in tropicals yukon and indigirk 3 2 the seasonal variations of et in two models at different scales we further analyzed the seasonal variations of et from the two models at 46 sites generally it was found that the seasonal patterns of et were well captured by the two models at all sites the selected 24 sites shown in supplementary fig s2 however at br sa1 site the seasonal variations of et estimations by gleam showed difference with that of observations fig 4 in addition to br sa1 site we also selected the br sa3 site 3 02 s 54 97 w from fluxnet data and k34 site 2 60 s 60 20 w in the literature of da rocha et al 2009 to further analyze the seasonal patterns of et in tropical rainforest the data at br sa3 site in 2002 and 2004 and k34 from 1999 to 2006 were collected in this study the mean annual precipitation over these sites were large 2701 mm year 1 for br sa1 1569 mm year 1 for br sa3 and 2286 mm year 1 for k34 interestingly the observed et at three sites in the dry seasons were higher than that in wet seasons the seasonal variations of observed et at three sites were consistent with that of net radiation and temperature but contrary to that of precipitation fig 4 we found that the seasonal patterns of simulated et by sith were generally consistent with that of the observed et at the three sites on the contrary the seasonal patterns of simulated et by gleam at these sites were different from that of observations with high values in wet seasons and low values in dry seasons in addition we also compared the different components of et from two models at these sites fig 4 it was found that during the wet seasons the interception loss and transpiration simulated by gleam were obviously higher than that simulated by sith during dry seasons the performances of the two models were comparable in the partitioning of et at these sites in addition long term monthly average et from 1984 to 2006 in sith and gleam versus the estimated wb et at 32 catchments were shown in fig 5 the seasonal patterns of estimated et by sith and gleam were basically consistent with that of wb et at most of basins with high values in local summer and low values in local winter however the simulated monthly average et by the two models showed poor agreement with the estimated wb et over the basins in tropical regions i e amazon congo and mekong basins in addition the estimated et by sith and gleam were slightly higher than the monthly average wb et at some basins especially in nile indigirk and yukon basins 3 3 performances of two models in the partitioning of et at multiple scales the estimated et and its components by the two models against the filed measurements at each site were shown in fig 6 generally the performances of the two models in simulating total et were similar the slope of linear regression between observed and simulated et was 0 99 and 1 05 for sith and gleam respectively the values of r 2 were relatively high for the two models being 0 84 and 0 80 for sith and gleam respectively fig 6d however the performances of the two models exhibited great differences in et partitioning the slopes of linear regression between observed and simulated transpiration were 0 98 and 1 51 for sith and gleam respectively suggesting that gleam tended to overestimate transpiration nevertheless gleam produced a higher values of r 2 for transpiration than sith sith r 2 0 51 gleam r 2 0 78 fig 6c additionally the soil evaporation was significantly underestimated by gleam with low values of the linear regression slope 0 02 and r 2 0 004 on the contrary the sith performed relatively well in simulating soil evaporation slope 0 76 and r 2 0 62 fig 6a for interception we found that the two models tended to underestimate it with the values of regression slopes lower than 1 0 40 and 0 55 for sith and gleam respectively despite with relatively high r 2 0 95 and 0 83 for sith and gleam respectively fig 6b the spatial patterns of mean annual et and its different components estimated by sith and gleam were shown in fig 7 and the fractions of transpiration soil evaporation and interception in total et of the two models were shown in fig 8 the transpiration was the dominant component accounting for 0 67 and 0 76 of total et for sith and gleam respectively the estimated transpiration by gleam was generally higher than that by sith and thus the ratios of transpiration to et that is t r et of gleam were apparently higher than that of sith at most regions especially in low vegetation cover regions i e shrublands and grasslands generally low e s values were estimated by these two models over dense vegetation areas and high e s values over biomes with low vegetation covers however the simulated soil evaporation and the ratio of soil evaporation to et that is e s et by sith 0 25 were significantly higher than that estimated by gleam 0 09 finally the ratios of interception to et that is e i et by gleam 0 15 was slightly higher than that by sith 0 08 although the two models exhibited a consistent spatial distribution we also compared the performance of those two models in partitioning et across different biomes table 3 the average t r et ratios across different biomes estimated by gleam exhibited a relatively narrow range varying from 0 60 enf to 0 85 cro on the contrary the t r et ratios estimated by sith showed large variations across different vegetation types ranging from 0 32 osh to 0 80 wsa generally the t r et ratios estimated by gleam were clearly higher than that by sith over the shr gra and cro biomes 0 64 0 85 for gleam and 0 32 0 64 for sith the e s et ratios estimated by gleam were lower than that estimated by sith across all biomes 0 01 0 30 for gleam and 0 04 0 67 for sith noticeably it is expected that the e s et ratios over biomes with low vegetation covers should be high however the estimated e s et ratios over these biomes by gleam were relatively low 0 12 0 30 and the estimated e s et ratios by sith seemed to in reasonable ranges 0 48 0 67 the estimated e i et ratios for two models were high in forests especially at tropical rainforest and low in non forest regions nevertheless the estimated e i et ratios by gleam were slightly higher than sith across all biomes ranging from 0 03 to 0 29 for gleam and from 0 01 to 0 21 for sith respectively 4 discussion 4 1 the global land et anomalies in el niño and la niña events it has been well documented that the et over tropical rainforest was mainly determined by the energy rather than precipitation nemani et al 2003 jung et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 baker et al 2021 thus increased radiation in dry seasons can produce greater et than in wet seasons fig 4 however the seasonal variations in et estimated by gleam were quite different from the observations thus it seems that gleam can not properly capture the dynamics of et in response to climate perturbations across the tropics to verify our hypothesis we analyzed inter annual variability of et fig 9 and meteorological variables fig 10 during typical el niño i e 1987 1992 1994 and 2002 and la niña years i e 1999 2000 2010 and 2011 the spatial patterns of et estimated by gleam across tropics were significantly different from that estimated by sith and mte product during el niño years negative et anomalies were found by gleam across the tropics while positive anomalies were observed by sith and mte during la niña years the results were contrary to the above fig 9 in addition the spatial patterns of et anomalies by sith and mte are basically consistent with that of net radiation anomalies while these by gleam displayed an agreement with that of precipitation in el niño and la niña years figs 9 and 10 recently purdy et al 2018 also found increases in et across the tropics during el niño years by using an updated pt jpl et algorithm yan et al 2013 noticed that positive et anomalies in el niño years and negative et anomalies in la niña years were occurred in tropics and its spatial distribution was also consistent with potential et contrary to that of precipitation moreover guan et al 2015 found that when annual rainfall was greater than 2000 mm year 1 the tropical rainforest can utilize the water storage from the wet season to satisfy the plant water demand thus these two models exhibited contrasting behaviors and further exploration into the controlling mechanisms of et are still needed across these regions 4 2 the uncertainty of model structure in et partitioning generally the daily variations of estimated et by the two models showed a good consistency with the observations thus these two models performed well in response to the changes in environmental factors supplementary fig s3 however they exhibited great differences in et partitioning due to differences in model structure and parameterization the estimated soil evaporation by gleam was significantly lower than observations with relatively low regression slope and r 2 on the contrary sith performed relatively well in simulations of soil evaporation with regression slope close to 1 and relatively high r 2 fig 4 in the two models soil evaporation was constrained to occur only in the upper soil layer and was tuned down to actual values by using similar stress functions eqs 4 and 12 for gleam and sith respectively the main differences between them may be due to the spatial grid representation of the et processes in the gleam model soil evaporation under the tall and short canopy was ignored and only takes the portion of bare soil in each grid into account eqs 1 and 2 for the vegetation with low leaf area index the soil evaporation under the vegetation canopy often contributed a significant portion of total et black and kelliher 1989 baldocchi and meyers 1991 barbour et al 2005 unsworth et al 2004 thus the underestimation of soil evaporation from gleam may occur in vegetated regions especially over biomes with low vegetation covers i e shrublands and grasslands both models used soil water content as one of the stress factor to limit the potential transpiration as the source of water for transpiration mainly comes from the soil incorporating soil water content into the algorithms of transpiration can improve the model performances federer et al 2003 maurer et al 2002 de jeu et al 2008 purdy et al 2018 brust et al 2021 however these two models adopted different stress factors to reflect the vegetation state such as plant temperature eq 11 for sith and vegetation optical depth eq 3 for gleam however the stress factor using temperature f t eq 11 by sith may not well capture the actual vegetation state during the whole growing stages on the contrary vod can reflect the plant water status as well as photosynthetic activity and thus provides a dynamic information on vegetation state woodhouse 2005 liu et al 2013 de jeu et al 2008 miralles et al 2011 therefore gleam can better capture the dynamic features of transpiration than sith fig 6 in addition in regions with sufficient water supply et was mainly determined by the atmospheric moisture demand i e net radiation and vapour pressure deficit which are often closely related with temperature jung et al 2010 thus the poor performances of gleam in energy limited regions such as tropical rainforest may be due to the absence of stress factors of atmospheric moisture demand which usually highly correlated with temperature for sith the overestimated et in these regions may be due to the unconsidered influences of vegetation states on et eq 11 therefore the stresses on transpiration should take the available soil moisture vegetation state and atmospheric moisture demand into accounts interception loss is the process of the rainfall intercepted and stored by canopy and subsequently lost by evaporation from the canopy thus interception loss is strongly correlates with the amount of precipitation and canopy state pypker et al 2005 zheng and jia 2020 although the estimated e i by the two models showed a high correlation with field observations these two models clearly underestimated interception loss especially the sith model generally gleam provided a slightly better estimates of e i than sith up to date filed observations of interception have been widely conducted however these were mainly concentrated on forest ecosystems with few observations in sparse vegetation miralles et al 2010 zheng and jia 2020 therefore the specific source of uncertainty of two models in interception estimates was still unknown and more filed observations are needed to understand mechanism of interception loss over sparse vegetation 4 3 partitioning of et into three components recently researches on the t r et ratio had attracted much attentions for examples jasechko et al 2013 reported that the transpiration accounted about 0 80 0 90 of et based on isotope analysis across the global large basins taking the uncertainties of the isotopic data into accounts coenders gerrits et al 2014 reported that the t r et ratio ranged from 0 35 to 0 80 good et al 2015 estimated the ratios of t r et being 0 64 0 13 based on atmospheric vapour isotope measurements and isotope mass budget by compiling 81 filed observations schlesinger and jasechko 2104 reported that the ratio of t r et was about 0 61 0 15 the results from land surface models had shown that the ratio of t r et was only 0 43 and was argued to be underestimated lawrence et al 2007 2011 wang erlandsson et al 2014 berg and sheffield 2019 using the observations to constrain the land surface models lian et al 2018 increased the estimated t r et ratios from 0 41 0 11 to 0 62 0 0 6 recently a global mean ratio of t r et was estimated to be 0 57 0 07 based on 108 ensemble members from the combination of models and lai observed regression wei et al 2017 in addition many remote sensing based models pml and pt jpl estimated that the ratios of t r et ranged from 0 54 to 0 65 purdy et al 2018 zhang et al 2016 these indicated that the estimated t r et ratio by sith 0 67 was closer to reported values than that estimated by gleam 0 76 the overestimation of t r et ratio for gleam mainly occurred in gra 0 79 cro 0 85 and csh 0 78 compared with the mean t r et values being around 0 51 0 15 across these biome in previous studies lauenroth and bradford 2006 alton et al 2009 schlesinger and jasechko 2104 wang erlandsson et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 gu et al 2018 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2021 at global the e s et ratio in sith 0 25 was greater than gleam 0 09 and the e i et ratio in sith 0 08 was lower than gleam 0 15 at present the model based global mean e s et ratios were estimated to range from 0 24 to 0 52 miralles et al 2016 purdy et al 2018 dirmeyer et al 2005 berg and sheffield 2019 these results may indicate that gleam tended to underestimate the ratios of e s et over low vegetation regions relative low e s et ratios were estimated by gleam i e 0 14 for gra and 0 12 for csh however direct observations showed that soil evaporation may account 0 50 of total et compared over these regions wang erlandsson et al 2014 zhou et al 2016 for canopy interception the global mean e i et ratios were generally estimated ranging from 0 10 to 0 24 dirmeyer et al 2005 zhang et al 2016 miralles et al 2016 these results indicate that sith slightly underestimated the e s et ratio however the exact ratios of soil evaporation and canopy interception to et at global scale are still lack 5 conclusion using remote sensing et models for gleam and sith based on the priestley taylor equation this study systematically evaluated et partitioning and the uncertainty of et partitioning in the model structure in general both two models in et simulations performed well at different scales except the poor performance of gleam occurring in tropical rainforest lack of the stress of atmospheric moisture demand on transpiration in gleam lead to the overestimation of et in wet seasons at tropical rainforest as for the et partitioning the overestimated transpiration and slightly underestimated interception were occurred in gleam and modeled soil evaporation showed poor performance with the filed observations comparing with the observations the sith performed relatively well in simulating soil evaporation and underestimated interception the modeled transpiration in sith provided a lower correlation with observations than gleam owing to plant temperature limitation cannot reflect actual vegetation state in addition the t r et ratio in gleam was 0 76 with values higher than that of sith 0 67 and previous studies central mean value around 0 60 and the e s et values in gleam 0 09 was clearly lower than sith 0 25 and other modeled values due to neglecting the soil evaporation under short and tall vegetation results in the clearly overestimated t r et ratio and underestimated e s et in gleam occurred over low vegetation covers with t r et and e s et values ranging from 0 64 to 0 85 and from 0 07 to 0 30 respectively the modeled e i et ratio in sith 0 08 was slightly lower than gleam 0 15 the different scheme of parameterization of evaporation stress factors results in the different performance of models at et partitioning in this study we figure out the source of uncertainties of two models in et partitioning therefore improvements of et partitioning still needs more field observations to understand its mechanism and optimize the parameters and structure credit authorship contribution statement huiling chen writing original draft conceptualization gaofeng zhu
