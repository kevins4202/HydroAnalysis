biv measurements and the velocities of the bubbly flow were compared with the solutions of dam break theory pressure measurements were taken along the structure to estimate the local loading of the green water phenomena and they provided the maximum peak pressure rise time impulsiveness of the pressures and the peak frequencies of the pressure oscillation due to the air pocket generation on the wall of the structure during the green water keywords green water flow kinematics bubbly flow pressure distribution impulsiveness 1 introduction green water impact is one of the major concerns in the design of ships and offshore structures in harsh environments because it can cause tremendous damage to the topside equipment and injuries to crew on deck mitigation of green water loading has been an important consideration in the design of the shapes of hulls especially for offshore structures that must operate for a long time in survival conditions despite the fact that numerous efforts have been made to predict the structural loads and characteristics of the green water phenomena these phenomena are still challenging because of the high nonlinear characteristics of the wave structure interaction and the violent multi phase flow which make it difficult to estimate damage with analytical theories for decades several studies on green water have been conducted with experimental and numerical methods in efforts to understand the phenomena better and to predict the damage they cause greco 2001 conducted a series of experiments with a fixed rectangular model in a 2 d wave flume and observed the characteristics of the water that overtopped on the deck in regular waves various numerical approaches have been validated with the results of greco s experimental study using the volume of fluid vof model nielsen and mayer 2004 the mps method zhang et al 2013 and the immersed boundary method yan et al 2018 ariyarathne et al 2012 investigated the impact of green water due to plunging breaking waves on a simplified 3 d model while measuring the impact pressures on the structure and the void fractions of green water flow lee et al 2012 provided a series of measured data that include wave elevations and pressure distributions on an fpso with changing bow models and gatin et al 2018 conducted a validation of the experimental results using naval hydro pack software which is an extension of the collocated fv based cfd open course software foam extend weller et al 1998 jasak 2009 silva et al 2017a performed extensive model tests for an fpso exposed to beam and quartering seas and the results were compared with cfd simulations silva et al 2017b rosetti et al 2019 studied water shipping and its impacts on a fixed fpso in beam waves with experimental analysis and cfd simulations the results showed that the cfd simulations could be used to predict the force impulses of green water accurately it is well known that the green water flow from the sides of a ship significantly resembles the behavior of dam break flow goda et al 1979 because of the difficulty in using experimental techniques to investigate the height or the velocities of the water on deck researchers have used dam break theory to predict the flow characteristics of green water on deck buchner 2002 applied stoker s solution stoker 1957 of the dam break model on the green water phenomena with the shallow water assumption ryu and chang 2005 compared the solution of the dam break theory with experimental results and suggested a method to determine the initial water depth of the dam break model the dam break model has also been used in various numerical simulations e g the navier stokes solver kleefsman et al 2005 the smooth particle hydrodynamics sph method khayyer et al 2009 and the semi analytical solution using motion equations in lagrangian form yilmaz et al 2003 to understand the flow kinematics and the multi phase characteristics of the green water phenomena ryu and chang 2007 measured the velocity fields of the green water with a plunging wave breaker using the particle image velocimetry piv technique and the bubble image velocimetry biv technique they provided the dominant flow velocities for different green water phases around a model structure lee et al 2016 used the piv and biv techniques to perform model tests to investigate the behavior and flow kinematics of green water on a rectangular structure in lee et al 2016 s study the generation of green water was categorized into five steps the flow characteristics of the multi phase flow of green water around a structure were studied and the experimental data were compared with the results of their cfd simulations even though they investigated the flow kinematics of the multi phase flow due to green water there was no description of the relationship between its highly aerated flow and the impact loading of green water in order to investigate the pressures due to green water some researchers have focused on the features of the air pockets that are generated when waves impact structures the air pockets might be captured on the wall when a steep wave approaches a vertical structure and they start to be compressed and oscillate as the wave propagates it has been shown that the entrapped air reduces the impact pressure on a structure caused by the incoming waves and also distributes the pressure over a wide surface of the structure so the total impulse on the wall might not be decreased hattori et al 1994 for the characteristics of the air pocket in the wave impact on a vertical wall topliss et al 1993 suggested a formula for the frequency of pressure oscillations derived from a boundary value problem and the natural frequency of pressure oscillations provided by the formula was compared with the experimental results of hattori and arami 1993 and witte 1988 abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 proposed an improved formula that considered the shape of the air pocket in estimating the natural frequency and the formula was validated by the experimental results obtained by lugni et al 2010 even so more studies are needed to get an accurate understanding of the role of air pockets in green water impacts in the present study the green water phenomena on a fixed rectangular structure was investigated with a series of experiments in a 2 d wave flume by measuring the velocity profiles of the water and the bubbly flow and pressure distributions on the structure the velocity fields of water flow were obtained by piv and bubbly flow was assessed by the biv measurement technique this paper provides the flow kinematics of the green water phenomena i e the mass flow rate and kinetic energy at the weather side of the structure the velocity profile of bubbly flow on the deck due to green water and comparison with dam break theory and the pressure distributions on the wall and the deck with analysis of the impact pressures the air pocket generated in the green water around the structure was studied and the peak frequency of the air pocket was compared with the analytical solutions provided by topliss et al 1993 and abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 2 experimental setup and techniques 2 1 experimental setup a series of experiments was performed in a 2 d wave tank 32 m long 0 6 m wide 1 m deep to investigate the green water phenomena on a fixed rectangular structure the wave tank had a piston type wave maker and a sloped beach 1 3 at the end of the wave tank to absorb energy of the incoming wave with a reflection ratio less than 5 the depth of the water in the wave tank was maintained at 0 60 m the acrylic rectangular shaped model was installed wall to wall in the beam sea condition and fixed with an alloy frame at the position 15 m from the wave maker the dimensions of the model were determined based on the bw pioneer fpso which has been operating in the west central of the gulf of mexico since 2008 and it was scaled down with the ratio of 1 125 table 1 the length of the model was the same as the dimension of the wave tank 0 60 m in order to avoid having to consider the 3 d effects of the green water phenomena and the length was not followed by the scale ratio table 2 shows that the regular wave conditions were chosen as the significant wave height h 1 3 and the peak period t p of the 100 yrs return period in the gulf of mexico api 2int met 2007 in addition two more wave conditions h 1 10 and h 1 100 with larger steepness than the significant wave height were estimated lee et al 2016 and used in the experiments to account for extreme ocean environments all of the equipment in this experiment was synchronized and all of the measuring procedures were completed before the reflected waves reached the model structure from the wave absorber the wave heights and water particle velocity profiles of incoming waves were obtained by a wave gauge and the piv system respectively see fig 1 the measured data were validated with stokes 3rd order wave theory in which the incoming waves belong and were in good agreement with the theoretical values of the wave heights and the horizontal water particle velocity profiles fig 2 all of the measurements were taken with one wave for each test and the test was repeated fifteen times as shown in fig 3 to avoid the reflected waves the time duration of the measurements was chosen at the transient wave passed and before the arrival of the reflected wave from the wave absorber 2 2 experimental techniques 2 2 1 particle image velocimetry piv technique the particle image velocimetry piv technique was used to obtain the velocity fields of the green water phenomena at the weather side of the structure with exception of the bubbly flow region the piv images were obtained with an acquisition rate of 500 hz using a high speed ccd camera redlake y5 mounted with a 105 mm f 1 8 macro focal lens nikkon 105 mm lens set at f 2 8 the lens had 2352ⅹ1728 pixels a pixel size of 7 μ m 8 bit dynamic range the two different fields of view fov were used to cover the entire region of the weather side of the rectangular structure with each size being 147 mmⅹ200 mm which corresponded to the special resolutions of 2 72 mm between every velocity vector in the interrogation area of 64ⅹ64 pixels with 50 overlap fig 4 the continuous laser max 8 watt wave length of 532 nm was used to illuminate the piv particles which had a mean diameter of 57 μ m and a specific gravity of 1 02 the adaptive multi pass algorithm was used to get a stronger cross correlation as shown in equation 1 raffel et al 1998 1 c δ x δ y 1 m n i 0 m 1 j 0 n 1 f m n g m δ x n δ y where the c cross correlation function f and g are the distribution of intensity in continuous images i and j are the positions in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively and m and n are the number of pixels in each direction respectively the false vectors in the vector fields that were calculated were eliminated by using the median test i e equation 2 westerweel 1994 2 u 2 d m e d i a n u 2 d i j ε t h r e s h where u 2d n is all neighboring velocity vectors u 2d i j is the velocity vector that is being inspected and ε t h r e s h is the threshold value for inspection 1 1 was used in this study 2 2 2 bubble image velocimetry biv technique the bubble image velocimetry biv technique mori and chang 2003 was used to obtain the velocity fields of bubbly flow at the weather side and on the deck of the rectangular model structure biv images were obtained with the a ccd camera that had 50 mm f 1 8 macro focal lens sigma 50 mm lens set of f 4 0 the shadow graphy image technique settles 2012 was used for the biv images with the acquisition rate of 500 hz fov size was 360 mmⅹ264 mm fig 5 corresponding to the spatial resolution of 2 44 mm between each vector in the interrogation area of 32 32 pixels with 50 overlap the velocity vectors of bubbly flow in the biv images were calculated as shown in equation 3 using the minimum quadratic difference mqd method which is more accurate than the cross correlation method mori and chang 2003 3 d m n 1 m n i 1 m j 1 n g 1 i j g 2 i m j n 2 3 pressure measurements pressure distributions along the structure of the model were obtained to estimate the local loading caused by the green water phenomena on the rectangular structure the pressures due to green water were measured at three locations on the weather side and at two locations on the deck of the structure fig 6 the pressure data were acquired by piezo resistive type pressure sensors kistler 4043a2 which could measure the static and dynamic pressures covering the range from 0 to 2 bars the sampling rate for the measurements was maintained at 5 khz which was determined by conducting convergence test all measurements were repeated 15 times with the same wave conditions the finite impulse response fir low pass filter which has less phase and delay distortion than the infinite impulse response iir filter mcclellan and parks 1973 was used to remove the background noise in the pressure data the cut off frequency for the low pass filter was determined to be 150 hz considering the frequency component of the background noise fig 7 and the 67th order of the fir filter was used to maintain the ratio of zeroth moment of the spectrum for filtered and raw signals up to 90 for the components that were lower than the cut off frequency equation 4 and to maintain a ratio lower than 10 for the higher components than the cut off frequency equation 5 as shown in fig 8 4 r a n 0 f c s f ω n d ω 0 f c s r ω d ω 0 9 5 r b n f c s f ω n d ω f c s r ω d ω 0 1 where r a and r b are the ratios of the zeroth moment of the two spectra f c is the cut off frequency s f and s r are the spectra of the filtered signal and the raw signal respectively ω is the frequency and n is the order of the fir filter 3 results 3 1 flow kinematics at the weather side of structure for the generation of the green water phenomena on a rectangular structure greco 2001 classified the green water generation into two stages i e 1 the initial stage of the water shipping when the water started to be shipped on deck and 2 the later stage of the water shipping that formed a dam break type on deck lee et al 2016 suggested that the generation of green water could be categorized into the five phases presented below flip through incoming wave is deformed vertically with a concave face before the wave front impacts on the weather side of the structure air entrapment air is entrapped on the weather side of the structure wave run up the water level increases along the weather side and splashes up into air wave overturning the wave overturns like a plunging wave breaker and impacts on the deck water shipping the body of bubbly water is moved forward along the deck in this study the piv and biv measurements were used to obtain the velocity fields of water and bubbly flow near the rectangular structure in order to investigate the flow kinematics of the multi phase flow due to the green water phenomena fig 9 shows the vector fields that were acquired at each step of the green water generation the blue and yellow vectors in the images represent the velocity of water around the structure obtained by piv measurements and the velocity of bubbly flow by biv measurements respectively to investigate the quantitative flow kinematics on the weather side of the structure during the generation of green water the mass flow rate and the kinetic energy per unit length in the horizontal direction were calculated with the water velocity profiles obtained by the piv measurements the mass flow rate and the kinetic energy passing through a vertical cross section in fov were calculated using the following equations 6 m x t x c s s η ρ b u x z t d z 7 k e x t x c s s η 1 2 ρ b u 2 x z t h o r i z o n t a l 1 2 ρ b w 2 x z t v e r t i c a l d z where m is the mass flow rate η is the free surface ρ is the density of water b is the width of the wave flume k e is the kinetic energy u and w are the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively and s is the bottom of the fov the values were normalized with ρ v p d b and ρ v p 2 d b for each mass flow rate and kinetic energy where v p denotes the phase velocity of the incoming waves v p 1 72 m s to investigate the spatial differences in the mass flow rate and the kinetic energy the values were obtained at seven fixed and equally spaced locations in the fov and the averaged values are shown in fig 10 with the error bars which indicate the corresponding 95 confidence interval the errors in both the mass flow rate and the kinetic energy were less than 10 of each maximum quantity over one wave period in this study all of the values of mass flow rate and kinetic energy were shown with the results obtained on the cross section at x b 0 12 where b is breadth of the model that was out of the bubbly flow region fig 11 shows the comparison of the mass flow rates without and with the structure for the three wave heights over the entire wave period the total area under the curves in fig 11 is the mass of water that went through the cross section at x b 0 12 during one wave period this mass was less than it would have been due to the existence of the structure the green water phenomena on the deck and the reflected wave from the structure would be the main reasons for the decrease in the mass flow rate of the water and due to the superposition of the incoming and reflected waves a standing wave might develop and the vertical velocity component obviously dominant near the structure the structure resulted in the decrease of 49 34 32 of the water mass at the condition of h 1 100 h 1 10 and h 1 3 respectively fig 12 shows the variations of the kinetic energy on the cross section of x b 0 12 without and with the structure the kinetic energy without the structure was the maximum magnitude at the wave crest phase and it was distributed in a symmetrical shape with respect to the phase π for the case with the structure the distribution of the kinetic energy changed to an asymmetric pattern that had two peaks the magnitude of vertical velocity component was increased dramatically due to the green water phenomena of which the first and second peaks matched with the wave run up phase and the water shipping phase as shown in fig 9 c and e respectively 3 2 flow kinematics of water shipping on deck when the green water phenomena occurred air pockets were generated on the wall and on the deck of the structure due to the plunging wave breaking which overturned on the deck fig 13 in the wave overturning phase fig 9 d the air pockets start to rotate in clock wise cw and fluctuate and the bubbly flow with air pockets start to run along the surface of the structure with the motion of the bubbles in the water shipping phase fig 9 e this type of overtopping could be in the green water regimes of plunging plus dam break pdb as classified by greco et al 2007 and zhang et al 2019 due to the limitation of the piv technique for measuring the flow kinematics of bubbly flow due to the reflection of the laser sheet on the bubbles the biv measurement was used to study the flow kinematics of the water shipping phase on the deck the time the water stayed on the deck during the generation of the green water was less than 0 1s which was shorter than the relaxation time for the rising bubble that corresponded to the bubble size 1 2 cm of the water shipping flow hysing et al 2009 this indicated that the inertial force of the water around the bubbles had a more dominant effect on the motion of bubbles than the buoyancy force and the vertical displacement of the bubbles in the water shipping phase on the deck was much smaller than the horizontal motion to investigate the characteristics of bubbly flow in the water shipping phase on the deck the spatial mean velocities in the horizontal direction were obtained for every 20ⅹ2 5 mm2 using the velocity profiles obtained by biv measurements as shown in fig 14 the horizontal mean velocities were normalized by the phase velocity of the incoming waves v p 1 72 m s of which magnitude presented in the distance of each symbol from the dashed line of its left hand side fig 14 shows the mean velocity profiles every 0 03 s after the wave overturning phase for each wave height the distribution of the symbols presented the velocity profiles of bubbly flow erratically because they could only be measured in the bubble region by the biv technique the error bar indicates the 95 confidence interval of each mean velocity more bubbles were generated with the higher wave height condition and those velocities were for the most part faster than the velocities with the lower wave condition the magnitude of the velocity of the bubbly flow increased gradually along the deck and the maximum values occurred in the range of 120 160 mm away from the corner of the structure the horizontal velocities of the bubbly flow were compared with the analytical solution of the dam breaking phenomena stoker 1957 as shown in equation 8 8 u x t 2 3 g h x t where u is horizontal velocity g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the initial water depth of the dam buchner 2002 suggested the use of the freeboard exceedance instead of the initial water depth to predict the horizontal velocity of the water shipping phase due to the green water phenomena equation 9 9 h 9 4 h where h is the freeboard exceedance ryu et al 2007 tested the green water phenomena on a fixed rectangular structure due to the plunging breaking wave and suggested the use of equation 10 to estimate the horizontal velocity of the water on the deck 10 h 0 36 v p 2 g fig 15 compares the horizontal velocities of the bubbly flow spatially averaged in the z direction and the solutions of a dam break problem for every 0 03 s after the wave overturning phase the symbols and the error bars are the averaged bubbly flow velocities and its corresponding 95 confidence interval on the deck respectively which were obtained by biv measurements in the study it was suggested that rather than using initial water depth in equation 8 to predict the horizontal velocity of the water on the deck the water level from the corner of the structure at each time should be used which was obtained in the instantaneous images taken by the high speed ccd camera fig 16 and are shown by the blue lines in fig 15 this method could estimate the measured velocities better than the solutions of equations 9 and 10 for every instance the solutions of equations 9 and 10 overestimated the velocities because of the fixed y intercepts that did not vary with time the method suggested in this study includes the effect of variations in the free surface during the generation of the green water which was not provided by the solutions with equations 9 and 10 3 3 pressure measurements pressures were measured on the wall and on the deck of the structure during the generation of green water and fig 17 shows the results for one wave period for three different wave heights fig 17 a and b show that the pressures on the wall of the structure pg1 and pg2 increased suddenly the first pressure peak was reached at the moment the air pocket was entrapped when the wave face hit the wall and the pressure was oscillated and decreased during the air entrapment phase fig 9 b the first pressure peak at pg1 was larger than the pressure peaks at pg2 even though the wave face hit directly near pg2 after the flip through phase when the wave height was h 1 3 the pressure peak and oscillation did not occur because no air pocket was entrapped on the wall lee et al 2016 thus the magnitude of the first pressure peak and the pressure oscillation phenomena occurred due to the bubble effect of the entrapped air on the wall the pressure increased gradually during the wave run up along the wall fig 9 c and the second peak was reached as the free surface increased up to the maximum water level at the corner of the structure which was defined as the wave overturning phase fig 9 d fig 17 c d and e show that the pressures on the deck pg3 pg4 pg5 increased when the water overtopped the deck after the wave was overturned at the corner of the structure and the pressures gradually diminished due to the drainage of water during the water shipping phase along the deck bubbly flow occurred at the corner of the structure in the overturning phase and it ran along the deck during the water shipping phase but unlike what occurred on the weather side wall the bubbly flow was not found to have an effect on the increase in the pressure and the oscillation on the deck fig 18 shows that the pressure on the deck was induced mainly by the hydrostatic pressure over each pressure sensor fig 19 shows that the pressures that were measured were non dimensionalized by 0 5 ρ u 2 max where u max is the maximum horizontal velocity of the water of the incoming wave using linear wave theory at the weather side wall pg1 and pg2 the non dimensionalized pressures at the smaller wave height condition were larger than those at the larger wave height condition this occurred because except for the first peak pressure the pressure on the wall did not increase as much as the incoming wave increased this showed that the largest non dimensionalized pressures on the deck pg3 pg4 and pg5 were related to each incoming wave height condition and there was an almost linear relationship with the square of the maximum horizontal water velocity of the incoming wave fig 20 shows the mean values and the corresponding 95 confidence interval of the maximum peak pressure and rise time at the first pressure peak obtained by repeating the tests at each wave condition fifteen times the rise time was calculated as twice the time duration from the half peak to the peak value as suggested by dnv gl dnv gl 2016 in fig 20 a because of the bubble entrapped on the weather side wall at the wave conditions of h 1 100 and h 1 10 the pressures measured at pg1 and pg2 had larger mean magnitudes and standard deviations than the pressures on the deck also the rise times at the weather side wall i e less than 0 01 s were shorter than those on the deck fig 20 b the magnitude of the peak pressure was inversely proportional to the duration of the rise time in the air entrapment phase which showed similar patterns with previous studies of the wave impact phenomena on the vertical wall bagnold 1939 denny 1951 kırkgöz 1995 hattori et al 1994 cuomo et al 2011 fig 21 shows that the oscillation of the pressure occurred at the weather side wall pg1 pg2 when the air pocket was entrapped at wave conditions of h 1 100 and h 1 10 the symbols indicates the raw pressures that were measured with the sampling rate of 5 khz and the solid line is the signal filtered by an fir low pass filter the specifications of the low pass filter were presented in section 2 3 fig 22 shows the results when the pressure spectra were plotted for fifteen repeated tests at the same wave conditions note that the peak magnitude of the spectrum and its corresponding frequency at the wave condition of h 1 100 were larger and lower respectively than that of h 1 10 the pressure spectra were different for each repeated test but the peak frequencies of the spectra were coincident in all of the tests the peak frequencies of pressure oscillation were matched for the same wave condition at pg1 and pg2 even though the air pocket was rotated at the location of pg1 and turned to the corner of the structure fig 21 and equations 9 and 10 show that the peak frequency of the incoming wave height h 1 100 was lower than that of h 1 10 because it depended on the size of air bubble and its location with respect to the free surface topliss et al 1993 and abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 suggested a formula for estimating the peak frequencies of the wave impact on the vertical wall and the sloshing in the rectangular tank based on 2 d potential flow theory assuming an adiabatic pressure density relationship equation 11 is the analytical solution provided by topliss et al 1993 11 ω 2 2 γ p a t m ρ r 2 log r 2 h where γ is the ratio of specific heats which is 1 4 for air r is the equivalent radius of the air pocket and h is the distance from the free surface to the center of the air pocket fig 23 abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 suggested a formula equation 12 that considers the shape of the air pocket which might not be a semi circle 12 ω 2 2 γ p a t m k sin π b 2 a ω 0 k sin π b 2 a where a and b are the distances from free surface and the upper part of air pocket fig 23 respectively ω 0 is the area of the air pocket and k is obtained by equation 13 13 k k 0 1 1 1 x 2 1 k 2 x 2 d x fig 24 shows the peak frequencies measured in tests compared with the results of equations 9 and 10 the equivalent radius r was defined as the radius of a semi circle that corresponded to the area of the ellipsoidal air pocket on the structure both methods could predict the peak frequencies with reasonable agreement with test results this may be the result of the differences between the assumptions of the 2 d theories and the uncertainty of the experimental sizing of the area of air bubbles near the wall of the wave tank the wave load acting on a vertical wall was suggested by two patterns i e impact impulsive or dynamic and quasi static pulsating wave loads allsop et al 1996 as follows an impact impulsive or dynamic wave load could be caused by the special conditions that arise when a wave breaks onto the structure with greater intensity than the quasi static load in a shorter duration a quasi static pulsating wave load varies with the order of magnitude of the free surface elevation for a relatively long duration a few studies have provided quantitative definitions of the impact criteria hayashi and tanaka 1988 classified the dynamic mode of loading versus the strain rate using the five criteria of creep static or quasi static dynamic impact and hypervelocity impact oumeraci et al 2001 suggested defining the impact phenomena as a peak loading 2 5 times larger than the subsequent quasi static loading due to the water waves on the vertical wall ariyarathne et al 2012 suggested a specific value of impulsiveness using the non dimensional pressure rate to the rise time with the wave celerity for the green water phenomena due to a plunging breaking wave in this study the impulsiveness ariyarathne et al 2012 was estimated using the pressure rate to the rise time and the maximum water velocity under the regular wave this was done because the dominant factors would be the severity of pressures and the horizontal water velocity acting on the vertical wall instead of the wave celerity the impulsiveness of ariyarathne et al 2012 was modified as shown in equation 14 14 i p p i m p t r 0 5 ρ u max 2 t 1500 where p imp is the maximum pressure t r is the rise time u max is the maximum horizontal velocity of the water of the incoming wave using the linear wave theory the impulsiveness i p was calculated for each test of fifteen repeated trials at the same wave condition for three wave heights i e h 1 100 h 1 10 and h 1 3 as shown in fig 25 the impulsiveness was larger at the location on the weather side where an air pocket was generated the impulsiveness at pg1 was noticeable at the conditions of h 1 100 and h 1 10 at which the movement of the air pocket was very active on the weather side at the location of pg2 the impulsiveness was smaller than it was at pg1 because its location was out of the air pocket region but the pressure rate to the rise time would be more significant for the higher wave height condition i e h 1 100 than the pressure rate to rise time would be for the wave height of h 1 10 and h 1 3 due to increased horizontal velocity of the water acting on the vertical wall this suggests an impulsiveness threshold of i p 1500 to define the wave impact criteria which was estimated to be 1500 at pg1 in the condition of h 1 3 without the generation of an air pocket due to the wave action on the vertical wall the pressures along the deck were similar to the hydrostatic pressure estimated by the water elevation over each of the pressure sensors which was defined as the quasi static loading by allsop et al 1996 the impulsiveness values at the locations of pg3 pg4 and pg5 on the deck were smaller than the suggested threshold and the wave loading on the deck could be represented by the quasi static criteria 4 conclusions green water phenomena on the fixed rectangular structure were studied with a series of experiments conducted in 2 d wave flume the model was simplified and scaled down with the ratio of 1 125 from fpso bw pioneer which has been operating in the west central of the gulf of mexico three regular wave conditions were tested with the wave heights of h 1 100 h 1 10 and h 1 3 and the peak period of 100 yrs return period was used at the operating site piv and biv measurements were used to obtain the water and bubbly flow to study the flow kinematics of the multi phase flow induced by green water the mass flow rate and the kinetic energy which were calculated from the water velocity profiles obtained by piv measurements were compared with and without the structure to investigate the quantitative flow kinematics of water flow at the weather side of the structure the characteristics of bubbly flow in the water shipping phase on the deck were investigated based on the velocities of the bubbly flow obtained by biv measurements and the velocities of the bubbly flow were compared with the solutions of dam break theory pressure measurements were conducted along the structure of the model to estimate the local loading due to green water and the maximum peak pressure and rise time were provided the peak frequencies of pressure oscillation due to the air pocket entrapped on the weather side wall were analyzed and compared with the results of the formulas suggested by topliss et al 1993 and abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 the impulsiveness suggested by ariyarathne et al 2012 was modified and a new equation using the horizontal velocity of the water was suggested to classify the impact criteria from the results obtained in this study the findings are summarized as below it was observed that the horizontal mass flow rate in fov at the weather side of the structure was decreased due to the existence of the structure the kinetic energy in the same fov was increased drastically due to the existence of structure having two peaks at the wave run up and the water shipping phases the main reason was that the horizontal velocity component of the incoming wave became the vertical direction velocity which might have been caused by the local standing wave that was generated by the superposition of the incoming and reflected waves near the structure at the higher wave height condition the velocity of bubbly flow had more bubbles and became faster on the deck those velocities increased gradually along the deck and had the maximum values at 120 160 mm away from the corner of the structure the horizontal bubbly flow velocities were compared with the solutions of the dam breaking problem it was suggested that the dam break theory to be used with the water level from the corner of the structure for the initial water depth in this study the suggested method showed better agreement with the measured bubbly flow velocities than those of buchner 2002 and ryu et al 2007 because it was able to utilize the free surface variation during the green water generation instead of the initial water depth which was constant buchner 2002 ryu et al 2007 the pressure at the weather side wall increased the first pressure peak at the air entrapment phase and it oscillated due to the air pocket that was entrapped on the wall following the first peak and oscillation the pressure increased gradually with the free surface rising and the second peak was reached at the wave overturning phase the pressures on the deck increased when the water overtopped the deck in the wave overturning phase and it was reduced gradually during the water drainage along the deck the pressure peaks on the deck which were non dimensionalized with the square of the maximum horizontal water velocity of the incoming wave had similar magnitudes for each incoming wave height pressure oscillations were observed at the weather side wall when the air pocket was entrapped at the wave conditions of h 1 100 and h 1 10 the peak frequencies of the pressure oscillation were compared with the analytical formulas suggested by topliss et al 1993 and abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 the formulas could predict the peak frequencies reasonably with the differences due to the limitations of the equations limited in 2 d and the experimental uncertainty associated with sizing the area of the air pocket the impulsiveness ariyarathne et al 2012 was applied to estimate the severity of the pressures using the maximum horizontal water velocity instead of the wave celerity the impulsiveness due to the dynamic pressure was more dominant at the location of the air pockets generated at the weather side wall smaller impulsiveness was estimated on the deck because the hydrostatic pressure was dominant a threshold was suggested to define the wave impact criteria as 1500 because it was the smallest impulsiveness due to the air pocket on the structure acknowledgement this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea

wall of the structure during the green water keywords green water flow kinematics bubbly flow pressure distribution impulsiveness 1 introduction green water impact is one of the major concerns in the design of ships and offshore structures in harsh environments because it can cause tremendous damage to the topside equipment and injuries to crew on deck mitigation of green water loading has been an important consideration in the design of the shapes of hulls especially for offshore structures that must operate for a long time in survival conditions despite the fact that numerous efforts have been made to predict the structural loads and characteristics of the green water phenomena these phenomena are still challenging because of the high nonlinear characteristics of the wave structure interaction and the violent multi phase flow which make it difficult to estimate damage with analytical theories for decades several studies on green water have been conducted with experimental and numerical methods in efforts to understand the phenomena better and to predict the damage they cause greco 2001 conducted a series of experiments with a fixed rectangular model in a 2 d wave flume and observed the characteristics of the water that overtopped on the deck in regular waves various numerical approaches have been validated with the results of greco s experimental study using the volume of fluid vof model nielsen and mayer 2004 the mps method zhang et al 2013 and the immersed boundary method yan et al 2018 ariyarathne et al 2012 investigated the impact of green water due to plunging breaking waves on a simplified 3 d model while measuring the impact pressures on the structure and the void fractions of green water flow lee et al 2012 provided a series of measured data that include wave elevations and pressure distributions on an fpso with changing bow models and gatin et al 2018 conducted a validation of the experimental results using naval hydro pack software which is an extension of the collocated fv based cfd open course software foam extend weller et al 1998 jasak 2009 silva et al 2017a performed extensive model tests for an fpso exposed to beam and quartering seas and the results were compared with cfd simulations silva et al 2017b rosetti et al 2019 studied water shipping and its impacts on a fixed fpso in beam waves with experimental analysis and cfd simulations the results showed that the cfd simulations could be used to predict the force impulses of green water accurately it is well known that the green water flow from the sides of a ship significantly resembles the behavior of dam break flow goda et al 1979 because of the difficulty in using experimental techniques to investigate the height or the velocities of the water on deck researchers have used dam break theory to predict the flow characteristics of green water on deck buchner 2002 applied stoker s solution stoker 1957 of the dam break model on the green water phenomena with the shallow water assumption ryu and chang 2005 compared the solution of the dam break theory with experimental results and suggested a method to determine the initial water depth of the dam break model the dam break model has also been used in various numerical simulations e g the navier stokes solver kleefsman et al 2005 the smooth particle hydrodynamics sph method khayyer et al 2009 and the semi analytical solution using motion equations in lagrangian form yilmaz et al 2003 to understand the flow kinematics and the multi phase characteristics of the green water phenomena ryu and chang 2007 measured the velocity fields of the green water with a plunging wave breaker using the particle image velocimetry piv technique and the bubble image velocimetry biv technique they provided the dominant flow velocities for different green water phases around a model structure lee et al 2016 used the piv and biv techniques to perform model tests to investigate the behavior and flow kinematics of green water on a rectangular structure in lee et al 2016 s study the generation of green water was categorized into five steps the flow characteristics of the multi phase flow of green water around a structure were studied and the experimental data were compared with the results of their cfd simulations even though they investigated the flow kinematics of the multi phase flow due to green water there was no description of the relationship between its highly aerated flow and the impact loading of green water in order to investigate the pressures due to green water some researchers have focused on the features of the air pockets that are generated when waves impact structures the air pockets might be captured on the wall when a steep wave approaches a vertical structure and they start to be compressed and oscillate as the wave propagates it has been shown that the entrapped air reduces the impact pressure on a structure caused by the incoming waves and also distributes the pressure over a wide surface of the structure so the total impulse on the wall might not be decreased hattori et al 1994 for the characteristics of the air pocket in the wave impact on a vertical wall topliss et al 1993 suggested a formula for the frequency of pressure oscillations derived from a boundary value problem and the natural frequency of pressure oscillations provided by the formula was compared with the experimental results of hattori and arami 1993 and witte 1988 abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 proposed an improved formula that considered the shape of the air pocket in estimating the natural frequency and the formula was validated by the experimental results obtained by lugni et al 2010 even so more studies are needed to get an accurate understanding of the role of air pockets in green water impacts in the present study the green water phenomena on a fixed rectangular structure was investigated with a series of experiments in a 2 d wave flume by measuring the velocity profiles of the water and the bubbly flow and pressure distributions on the structure the velocity fields of water flow were obtained by piv and bubbly flow was assessed by the biv measurement technique this paper provides the flow kinematics of the green water phenomena i e the mass flow rate and kinetic energy at the weather side of the structure the velocity profile of bubbly flow on the deck due to green water and comparison with dam break theory and the pressure distributions on the wall and the deck with analysis of the impact pressures the air pocket generated in the green water around the structure was studied and the peak frequency of the air pocket was compared with the analytical solutions provided by topliss et al 1993 and abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 2 experimental setup and techniques 2 1 experimental setup a series of experiments was performed in a 2 d wave tank 32 m long 0 6 m wide 1 m deep to investigate the green water phenomena on a fixed rectangular structure the wave tank had a piston type wave maker and a sloped beach 1 3 at the end of the wave tank to absorb energy of the incoming wave with a reflection ratio less than 5 the depth of the water in the wave tank was maintained at 0 60 m the acrylic rectangular shaped model was installed wall to wall in the beam sea condition and fixed with an alloy frame at the position 15 m from the wave maker the dimensions of the model were determined based on the bw pioneer fpso which has been operating in the west central of the gulf of mexico since 2008 and it was scaled down with the ratio of 1 125 table 1 the length of the model was the same as the dimension of the wave tank 0 60 m in order to avoid having to consider the 3 d effects of the green water phenomena and the length was not followed by the scale ratio table 2 shows that the regular wave conditions were chosen as the significant wave height h 1 3 and the peak period t p of the 100 yrs return period in the gulf of mexico api 2int met 2007 in addition two more wave conditions h 1 10 and h 1 100 with larger steepness than the significant wave height were estimated lee et al 2016 and used in the experiments to account for extreme ocean environments all of the equipment in this experiment was synchronized and all of the measuring procedures were completed before the reflected waves reached the model structure from the wave absorber the wave heights and water particle velocity profiles of incoming waves were obtained by a wave gauge and the piv system respectively see fig 1 the measured data were validated with stokes 3rd order wave theory in which the incoming waves belong and were in good agreement with the theoretical values of the wave heights and the horizontal water particle velocity profiles fig 2 all of the measurements were taken with one wave for each test and the test was repeated fifteen times as shown in fig 3 to avoid the reflected waves the time duration of the measurements was chosen at the transient wave passed and before the arrival of the reflected wave from the wave absorber 2 2 experimental techniques 2 2 1 particle image velocimetry piv technique the particle image velocimetry piv technique was used to obtain the velocity fields of the green water phenomena at the weather side of the structure with exception of the bubbly flow region the piv images were obtained with an acquisition rate of 500 hz using a high speed ccd camera redlake y5 mounted with a 105 mm f 1 8 macro focal lens nikkon 105 mm lens set at f 2 8 the lens had 2352ⅹ1728 pixels a pixel size of 7 μ m 8 bit dynamic range the two different fields of view fov were used to cover the entire region of the weather side of the rectangular structure with each size being 147 mmⅹ200 mm which corresponded to the special resolutions of 2 72 mm between every velocity vector in the interrogation area of 64ⅹ64 pixels with 50 overlap fig 4 the continuous laser max 8 watt wave length of 532 nm was used to illuminate the piv particles which had a mean diameter of 57 μ m and a specific gravity of 1 02 the adaptive multi pass algorithm was used to get a stronger cross correlation as shown in equation 1 raffel et al 1998 1 c δ x δ y 1 m n i 0 m 1 j 0 n 1 f m n g m δ x n δ y where the c cross correlation function f and g are the distribution of intensity in continuous images i and j are the positions in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively and m and n are the number of pixels in each direction respectively the false vectors in the vector fields that were calculated were eliminated

inspected and ε t h r e s h is the threshold value for inspection 1 1 was used in this study 2 2 2 bubble image velocimetry biv technique the bubble image velocimetry biv technique mori and chang 2003 was used to obtain the velocity fields of bubbly flow at the weather side and on the deck of the rectangular model structure biv images were obtained with the a ccd camera that had 50 mm f 1 8 macro focal lens sigma 50 mm lens set of f 4 0 the shadow graphy image technique settles 2012 was used for the biv images with the acquisition rate of 500 hz fov size was 360 mmⅹ264 mm fig 5 corresponding to the spatial resolution of 2 44 mm between each vector in the interrogation area of 32 32 pixels with 50 overlap the velocity vectors of bubbly flow in the biv images were calculated as shown in equation 3 using the minimum quadratic difference mqd method which is more accurate than the cross correlation method mori and chang 2003 3 d m n 1 m n i 1 m j 1 n g 1 i j g 2 i m j n 2 3 pressure measurements pressure distributions along the structure of the model were obtained to estimate the local loading caused by the green water phenomena on the rectangular structure the pressures due to green water were measured at three locations on the weather side and at two locations on the deck of the structure fig 6 the pressure data were acquired by piezo resistive type pressure sensors kistler 4043a2 which could measure the static and dynamic pressures covering the range from 0 to 2 bars the sampling rate for the measurements was maintained at 5 khz which was determined by conducting convergence test all measurements were repeated 15 times with the same wave conditions the finite impulse response fir low pass filter which has less phase and delay distortion than the infinite impulse response iir filter mcclellan and parks 1973 was used to remove the background noise in the pressure data the cut off frequency for the low pass filter was determined to be 150 hz considering the frequency component of the background noise fig 7 and the 67th order of the fir filter was used to maintain the ratio of zeroth moment of the spectrum for filtered and raw signals up to 90 for the components that were lower than the cut off frequency equation 4 and to maintain a ratio lower than 10 for the higher components than the cut off frequency equation 5 as shown in fig 8 4 r a n 0 f c s f ω n d ω 0 f c s r ω d ω 0 9 5 r b n f c s f ω n d ω f c s r ω d ω 0 1 where r a and r b are the ratios of the zeroth moment of the two spectra f c is the cut off frequency s f and s r are the spectra of the filtered signal and the raw signal respectively ω is the frequency and n is the order of the fir filter 3 results 3 1 flow kinematics at the weather side of structure for the generation of the green water phenomena on a rectangular structure greco 2001 classified the green water generation into two stages i e 1 the initial stage of the water shipping when the water started to be shipped on deck and 2 the later stage of the water shipping that formed a dam break type on deck lee et al 2016 suggested that the generation of green water could be categorized into the five phases presented below flip through incoming wave is deformed vertically with a concave face before the wave front impacts on the weather side of the structure air entrapment air is entrapped on the weather side of the structure wave run up the water level increases along the weather side and splashes up into air wave overturning the wave overturns like a plunging wave breaker and impacts on the deck water shipping the body of bubbly water is moved forward along the deck in this study the piv and biv measurements were used to obtain the velocity fields of water and bubbly flow near the rectangular structure in order to investigate the flow kinematics of the multi phase flow due to the green water phenomena fig 9 shows the vector fields that were acquired at each step of the green water generation the blue and yellow vectors in the images represent the velocity of water around the structure obtained by piv measurements and the velocity of bubbly flow by biv measurements respectively to investigate the quantitative flow kinematics on the weather side of the structure during the generation of green water the mass flow rate and the kinetic energy per unit length in the horizontal direction were calculated with the water velocity profiles obtained by the piv measurements the mass flow rate and the kinetic energy passing through a vertical cross section in fov were calculated using the following equations 6 m x t x c s s η ρ b u x z t d z 7 k e x t x c s s η 1 2 ρ b u 2 x z t h o r i z o n t a l 1 2 ρ b w 2 x z t v e r t i c a l d z where m is the mass flow rate η is the free surface ρ is the density of water b is the width of the wave flume k e is the kinetic energy u and w are the horizontal and vertical velocities respectively and s is the bottom of the fov the values were normalized with ρ v p d b and ρ v p 2 d b for each mass flow rate and kinetic energy where v p denotes the phase velocity of the incoming waves v p 1 72 m s to investigate the spatial differences in the mass flow rate and the kinetic energy the values were obtained at seven fixed and equally spaced locations in the fov and the averaged values are shown in fig 10 with the error bars which indicate the corresponding 95 confidence interval the errors in both the mass flow rate and the kinetic energy were less than 10 of each maximum quantity over one wave period in this study all of the values of mass flow rate and kinetic energy were shown with the results obtained on the cross section at x b 0 12 where b is breadth of the model that was out of the bubbly flow region fig 11 shows the comparison of the mass flow rates without and with the structure for the three wave heights over the entire wave period the total area under the curves in fig 11 is the mass of water that went through the cross section at x b 0 12 during one wave period this mass was less than it would have been due to the existence of the structure the green water phenomena on the deck and the reflected wave from the structure would be the main reasons for the decrease in the mass flow rate of the water and due to the superposition of the incoming and reflected waves a standing wave might develop and the vertical velocity component obviously dominant near the structure the structure resulted in the decrease of 49 34 32 of the water mass at the condition of h 1 100 h 1 10 and h 1 3 respectively fig 12 shows the variations of the kinetic energy on the cross section of x b 0 12 without and with the structure the kinetic energy without the structure was the maximum magnitude at the wave crest phase and it was distributed in a symmetrical shape with respect to the phase π for the case with the structure the distribution of the kinetic energy changed to an asymmetric pattern that had two peaks the magnitude of vertical velocity component was increased dramatically due to the green water phenomena of which the first and second peaks matched with the wave run up phase and the water shipping phase as shown in fig 9 c and e respectively 3 2 flow kinematics of water shipping on deck when the green water phenomena occurred air pockets were generated on the wall and on the deck of the structure due to the plunging wave breaking which overturned on the deck fig 13 in the wave overturning phase fig 9 d the air pockets start to rotate in clock wise cw and fluctuate and the bubbly flow with air pockets start to run along the surface of the structure with the motion of the bubbles in the water shipping phase fig 9 e this type of overtopping could be in the green water regimes of plunging plus dam break pdb as classified by greco et al 2007 and zhang et al 2019 due to the limitation of the piv technique for measuring the flow kinematics of bubbly flow due to the reflection of the laser sheet on the bubbles the biv measurement was used to study the flow kinematics of the water shipping phase on the deck the time the water stayed on the deck during the generation of the green water was less than 0 1s which was shorter than the relaxation time for the rising bubble that corresponded to the bubble size 1 2 cm of the water shipping flow hysing et al 2009 this indicated that the inertial force of the water around the bubbles had a more dominant effect on the motion of bubbles than the buoyancy force and the vertical displacement of the bubbles in the water shipping phase on the deck was much smaller than the horizontal motion to investigate the characteristics of bubbly flow in the water shipping phase on the deck the spatial mean velocities in the horizontal direction were obtained for every 20ⅹ2 5 mm2 using the velocity profiles obtained by biv measurements as shown in fig 14 the horizontal mean velocities were normalized by the phase velocity of the incoming waves v p 1 72 m s of which magnitude presented in the distance of each symbol from the dashed line of its left hand side fig 14 shows the mean velocity profiles every 0 03 s after the wave overturning phase for each wave height the distribution of the symbols presented the velocity profiles of bubbly flow erratically because they could only be measured in the bubble region by the biv technique the error bar indicates the 95 confidence interval of each mean velocity more bubbles were generated with the higher wave height condition and those velocities were for the most part faster than the velocities with the lower wave condition the magnitude of the velocity of the bubbly flow increased gradually along the deck and the maximum values occurred in the range of 120 160 mm away from the corner of the structure the horizontal velocities of the bubbly flow were compared with the analytical solution of the dam breaking phenomena stoker 1957 as shown in equation 8 8 u x t 2 3 g h x t where u is horizontal velocity g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the initial water depth of the dam buchner 2002 suggested the use of the freeboard exceedance instead of the initial water depth to predict the horizontal velocity of the water shipping phase due to the green water phenomena equation 9 9 h 9 4 h where h is the freeboard exceedance ryu et al 2007 tested the green water phenomena on a fixed rectangular structure due to the plunging breaking wave and suggested the use of equation 10 to estimate the horizontal velocity of the water on the deck 10 h 0 36 v p 2 g fig 15 compares the horizontal velocities of the bubbly flow spatially averaged in the z direction and the solutions of a dam break problem for every 0 03 s after the wave overturning phase the symbols and the error bars are the averaged bubbly flow velocities and its corresponding 95 confidence interval on the deck respectively which were obtained by biv measurements in the study it was suggested that rather than using initial water depth in equation 8 to predict the horizontal velocity of the water on the deck the water level from the corner of the structure at each time should be used which was obtained in the instantaneous images taken by the high speed ccd camera fig 16 and are shown by the blue lines in fig 15 this method could estimate the measured velocities better than the solutions of equations 9 and 10 for every instance the solutions of equations 9 and 10 overestimated the velocities because of the fixed y intercepts that did not vary with time the method suggested in this study includes the effect of variations in the free surface during the generation of the green water which was not provided by the solutions with equations 9 and 10 3 3 pressure measurements pressures were measured on the wall and on the deck of the structure during the generation of green water and fig 17 shows the results for one wave period for three different wave heights fig 17 a and b show that the pressures on the wall of the structure pg1 and pg2 increased suddenly the first pressure peak was reached at the moment the air pocket was entrapped when the wave face hit the wall and the pressure was oscillated and decreased during the air entrapment phase fig 9 b the first pressure peak at pg1 was larger than the pressure peaks at pg2 even though the wave face hit directly near pg2 after the flip through phase when the wave height was h 1 3 the pressure peak and oscillation did not occur because no air pocket was entrapped on the wall lee et al 2016 thus the magnitude of the first pressure peak and the pressure oscillation phenomena occurred due to the bubble effect of the entrapped air on the wall the pressure increased gradually during the wave run up along the wall fig 9 c and the second peak was reached as the free surface increased up to the maximum water level at the corner of the structure which was defined as the wave overturning phase fig 9 d fig 17 c d and e show that the pressures on the deck pg3 pg4 pg5 increased when the water overtopped the deck after the wave was overturned at the corner of the structure and the pressures gradually diminished due to the drainage of water during the water shipping phase along the deck bubbly flow occurred at the corner of the structure in the overturning phase and it ran along the deck during the water shipping phase but unlike what occurred on the weather side wall the bubbly flow was not found to have an effect on the increase in the pressure and the oscillation on the deck fig 18 shows that the pressure on the deck was induced mainly by the hydrostatic pressure over each pressure sensor fig 19 shows that the pressures that were measured were non dimensionalized by 0 5 ρ u 2 max where u max is the maximum horizontal velocity of the water of the incoming wave using linear wave theory at the weather side wall pg1 and pg2 the non dimensionalized pressures at the smaller wave height condition were larger than those at the larger wave height condition this occurred because except for the first peak pressure the pressure on the wall did not increase as much as the incoming wave increased this showed that the largest non dimensionalized pressures on the deck pg3 pg4 and pg5 were related to each incoming wave height condition and there was an almost linear relationship with the square of the maximum horizontal water velocity of the incoming wave fig 20 shows the mean values and the corresponding 95 confidence interval of the maximum peak pressure and rise time at the first pressure peak obtained by repeating the tests at each wave condition fifteen times the rise time was calculated as twice the time duration from the half peak to the peak value as suggested by dnv gl dnv gl 2016 in fig 20 a because of the bubble entrapped on the weather side wall at the wave conditions of h 1 100 and h 1 10 the pressures measured at pg1 and pg2 had larger mean magnitudes and standard deviations than the pressures on the deck also the rise times at the weather side wall i e less than 0 01 s were shorter than those on the deck fig 20 b the magnitude of the peak pressure was inversely proportional to the duration of the rise time in the air entrapment phase which showed similar patterns with previous studies of the wave impact phenomena on the vertical wall bagnold 1939 denny 1951 kırkgöz 1995 hattori et al 1994 cuomo et al 2011 fig 21 shows that the oscillation of the pressure occurred at the weather side wall pg1 pg2 when the air pocket was entrapped at wave conditions of h 1 100 and h 1 10 the symbols indicates the raw pressures that were measured with the sampling rate of 5 khz and the solid line is the signal filtered by an fir low pass filter the specifications of the low pass filter were presented in section 2 3 fig 22 shows the results when the pressure spectra were plotted for fifteen repeated tests at the same wave conditions note that the peak magnitude of the spectrum and its corresponding frequency at the wave condition of h 1 100 were larger and lower respectively than that of h 1 10 the pressure spectra were different for each repeated test but the peak frequencies of the spectra were coincident in all of the tests the peak frequencies of pressure oscillation were matched for the same wave condition at pg1 and pg2 even though the air pocket was rotated at the location of pg1 and turned to the corner of the structure fig 21 and equations 9 and 10 show that the peak frequency of the incoming wave height h 1 100 was lower than that of h 1 10 because it depended on the size of air bubble and its location with respect to the free surface topliss et al 1993 and abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 suggested a formula for estimating the peak frequencies of the wave impact on the vertical wall and the sloshing in the rectangular tank based on 2 d potential flow theory assuming an adiabatic pressure density relationship equation 11 is the analytical solution provided by topliss et al 1993 11 ω 2 2 γ p a t m ρ r 2 log r 2 h where γ is the ratio of specific heats which is 1 4 for air r is the equivalent radius of the air pocket and h is the distance from the free surface to the center of the air pocket fig 23 abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 suggested a formula equation 12 that considers the shape of the air pocket which might not be a semi circle 12 ω 2 2 γ p a t m k sin π b 2 a ω 0 k sin π b 2 a where a and b are the distances from free surface and the upper part of air pocket fig 23 respectively ω 0 is the area of the air pocket and k is obtained by equation 13 13 k k 0 1 1 1 x 2 1 k 2 x 2 d x fig 24 shows the peak frequencies measured in tests compared with the results of equations 9 and 10 the equivalent radius r was defined as the radius of a semi circle that corresponded to the area of the ellipsoidal air pocket on the structure both methods could predict the peak frequencies with reasonable agreement with test results this may be the result of the differences between the assumptions of the 2 d theories and the uncertainty of the experimental sizing of the area of air bubbles near the wall of the wave tank the wave load acting on a vertical wall was suggested by two patterns i e impact impulsive or dynamic and quasi static pulsating wave loads allsop et al 1996 as follows an impact impulsive or dynamic wave load could be caused by the special conditions that arise when a wave breaks onto the structure with greater intensity than the quasi static load in a shorter duration a quasi static pulsating wave load varies with the order of magnitude of the free surface elevation for a relatively long duration a few studies have provided quantitative definitions of the impact criteria hayashi and tanaka 1988 classified the dynamic mode of loading versus the strain rate using the five criteria of creep static or quasi static dynamic impact and hypervelocity impact oumeraci et al 2001 suggested defining the impact phenomena as a peak loading 2 5 times larger than the subsequent quasi static loading due to the water waves on the vertical wall ariyarathne et al 2012 suggested a specific value of impulsiveness using the non dimensional pressure rate to the rise time with the wave celerity for the green water phenomena due to a plunging breaking wave in this study the impulsiveness ariyarathne et al 2012 was estimated using the pressure rate to the rise time and the maximum water velocity under the regular wave this was done because the dominant factors would be the severity of pressures and the horizontal water velocity acting on the vertical wall instead of the wave celerity the impulsiveness of ariyarathne et al 2012 was modified as shown in equation 14 14 i p p i m p t r 0 5 ρ u max 2 t 1500 where p imp is the maximum pressure t r is the rise time u max is the maximum horizontal velocity of the water of the incoming wave using the linear wave theory the impulsiveness i p was calculated for each test of fifteen repeated trials at the same wave condition for three wave heights i e h 1 100 h 1 10 and h 1 3 as shown in fig 25 the impulsiveness was larger at the location on the weather side where an air pocket was generated the impulsiveness at pg1 was noticeable at the conditions of h 1 100 and h 1 10 at which the movement of the air pocket was very active on the weather side at the location of pg2 the impulsiveness was smaller than it was at pg1 because its location was out of the air pocket region but the pressure rate to the rise time would be more significant for the higher wave height condition i e h 1 100 than the pressure rate to rise time would be for the wave height of h 1 10 and h 1 3 due to increased horizontal velocity of the water acting on the vertical wall this suggests an impulsiveness threshold of i p 1500 to define the wave impact criteria which was estimated to be 1500 at pg1 in the condition of h 1 3 without the generation of an air pocket due to the wave action on the vertical wall the pressures along the deck were similar to the hydrostatic pressure estimated by the water elevation over each of the pressure sensors which was defined as the quasi static loading by allsop et al 1996 the impulsiveness values at the locations of pg3 pg4 and pg5 on the deck were smaller than the suggested threshold and the wave loading on the deck could be represented by the quasi static criteria 4 conclusions green water phenomena on the fixed rectangular structure were studied with a series of experiments conducted in 2 d wave flume the model was simplified and scaled down with the ratio of 1 125 from fpso bw pioneer which has been operating in the west central of the gulf of mexico three regular wave conditions were tested with the wave heights of h 1 100 h 1 10 and h 1 3 and the peak period of 100 yrs return period was used at the operating site piv and biv measurements were used to obtain the water and bubbly flow to study the flow kinematics of the multi phase flow induced by green water the mass flow rate and the kinetic energy which were calculated from the water velocity profiles obtained by piv measurements were compared with and without the structure to investigate the quantitative flow kinematics of water flow at the weather side of the structure the characteristics of bubbly flow in the water shipping phase on the deck were investigated based on the velocities of the bubbly flow obtained by biv measurements and the velocities of the bubbly flow were compared with the solutions of dam break theory pressure measurements were conducted along the structure of the model to estimate the local loading due to green water and the maximum peak pressure and rise time were provided the peak frequencies of pressure oscillation due to the air pocket entrapped on the weather side wall were analyzed and compared with the results of the formulas suggested by topliss et al 1993 and abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 the impulsiveness suggested by ariyarathne et al 2012 was modified and a new equation using the horizontal velocity of the water was suggested to classify the impact criteria from the results obtained in this study the findings are summarized as below it was observed that the horizontal mass flow rate in fov at the weather side of the structure was decreased due to the existence of the structure the kinetic energy in the same fov was increased drastically due to the existence of structure having two peaks at the wave run up and the water shipping phases the main reason was that the horizontal velocity component of the incoming wave became the vertical direction velocity which might have been caused by the local standing wave that was generated by the superposition of the incoming and reflected waves near the structure at the higher wave height condition the velocity of bubbly flow had more bubbles and became faster on the deck those velocities increased gradually along the deck and had the maximum values at 120 160 mm away from the corner of the structure the horizontal bubbly flow velocities were compared with the solutions of the dam breaking problem it was suggested that the dam break theory to be used with the water level from the corner of the structure for the initial water depth in this study the suggested method showed better agreement with the measured bubbly flow velocities than those of buchner 2002 and ryu et al 2007 because it was able to utilize the free surface variation during the green water generation instead of the initial water depth which was constant buchner 2002 ryu et al 2007 the pressure at the weather side wall increased the first pressure peak at the air entrapment phase and it oscillated due to the air pocket that was entrapped on the wall following the first peak and oscillation the pressure increased gradually with the free surface rising and the second peak was reached at the wave overturning phase the pressures on the deck increased when the water overtopped the deck in the wave overturning phase and it was reduced gradually during the water drainage along the deck the pressure peaks on the deck which were non dimensionalized with the square of the maximum horizontal water velocity of the incoming wave had similar magnitudes for each incoming wave height pressure oscillations were observed at the weather side wall when the air pocket was entrapped at the wave conditions of h 1 100 and h 1 10 the peak frequencies of the pressure oscillation were compared with the analytical formulas suggested by topliss et al 1993 and abrahamsen and faltinsen 2012 the formulas could predict the peak frequencies reasonably with the differences due to the limitations of the equations limited in 2 d and the experimental uncertainty associated with sizing the area of the air pocket the impulsiveness ariyarathne et al 2012 was applied to estimate the severity of the pressures using the maximum horizontal water velocity instead of the wave celerity the impulsiveness due to the dynamic pressure was more dominant at the location of the air pockets generated at the weather side wall smaller impulsiveness was estimated on the deck because the hydrostatic pressure was dominant a threshold was suggested to define the wave impact criteria as 1500 because it was the smallest impulsiveness due to the air pocket on the structure acknowledgement this work was supported by the national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea

22281,this paper presents comprehensive experimental results of scour around pile groups with different pile arrangements under different steady flow conditions with the main aim of analyzing the influence of pile spacing g d and froude number fr the temporal developments of scour depth measured at different positions around different piles are provided and yield exponential functions the temporal variations of scour depth at the front pile and the rear pile are significantly different for small values of fr the equilibrium scour depth of pile groups decreases with g d and the scour depth at the rear pile is apparently smaller than that at the front pile the critical value of g d representing the pile group effect tends to increase with fr the equilibrium scour topography is divided into local scour at individual pile and global scour over entire area of pile group and the local scour is less obvious with the increase of fr additionally the results of scour hole dimensions show that the length of the scour hole upstream of the pile group decreases with g d while the width of the scour hole increases slightly with g d finally empirical relationships are obtained to predict the equilibrium scour hole area and volume keywords pile group local scour froude number pile spacing temporal variation scour hole topography 1 introduction pile group is one of the commonly used foundations in offshore structures such as platforms wind turbines bridges etc pile group changes the flow pattern in their immediate surrounding which may cause an increase in the local sediment transport capacity resulting in local scour at the seabed around these structures scour around pile group foundations can undermine the stability of the structures and thus needs to be concerned however compared with the large number of studies on scour around monopile melville and coleman 2000 sumer and fredsøe 2002 or single pier liang et al 2013 qi et al 2016 2018 studies on scouring around pile groups are relatively limited in fact the structural complexity of pile group results in the flow field around the structures being more complicated sumner 2010 ataie ashtiani and aslani kordkandi 2013 the associated sediment transport and scouring process around the pile group are in turn more complex thus the understanding of which requires further investigation in the past several decades the relevant studies on pile group scour have mainly focused on the equilibrium scour depth as well as further exploring the influence of some governing variables and establishing empirical equations to predict the equilibrium scour depth sumer and fredsøe 1998 bayram and larson 2000 baghbadorani et al 2018 sumer and fredsøe 2002 pointed out that due to the flow interference between adjacent piles the scour around pile group is obviously different from that occurring around a single pile ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 derived a correction factor for inclusion in predictive equations to consider the influence of pile group arrangements amini et al 2012 studied the influence of pile spacing pile group arrangements uniform or non uniform spacing and submergence ratios in steady current lança et al 2013 investigated the influence of scour duration skew angle and number of pile group columns on the scour patterns and equilibrium scour depth liang et al 2017 conducted flume experiments of clear water scour using single pile tandem piles side by side piles and 3 3 pile groups and evaluated existing predictive equations by comparing with the experimental data in addition many numerical models have been recently proposed or used to predict scour depth around pile groups such as group method of data handling gmdh and neuro fuzzy gmdh najafzadeh and barani 2011 najafzadeh and azamathulla 2013 najafzadeh 2015 najafzadeh et al 2013 in general the previous studies mainly focused on the influence of the parameters of pile groups such as pile spacing pile arrangement and the skew angle with respect to the flow direction while ignoring the influence of flow parameters under a certain pile arrangement wang et al 2016 the flow structure e g turbulent vortex around individual piles in a group affects each other and this effect can be neglected when the pile spacing exceeds a certain critical value for example hannah 1978 mentioned that when g d 11 the scour depth at the pile group is the same with the scour depth of single pile which implies that the pile group effect can be neglected however amini et al 2012 pointed out that when g d 3 5 each pile had individual scour hole which is independent from each other zhang et al 2017 found that the interactions between the piles are almost non existent when g d 4 the proposed different result on the criterion of the critical value of g d is due to the different flow conditions considered in these experiments it is therefore that the influence of pile spacing under different flow conditions needs to be further studied due to the complex interaction between piles with turbulence in pile groups the morphology of the scour hole around pile groups exhibits different characteristics under different pile spacing and flow conditions liang et al 2013 vaghefi et al 2018 this is due to the varying turbulence structure within the scour hole implying that the mechanism of scour may be different for example sumer et al 2005 experimentally investigated scour around pile groups with different configurations exposed to steady current and pointed out that scour around pile groups is caused by two mechanisms those causing local scour at individual piles and those causing a global scour the general lowering of the bed over the entire area of the pile group kim et al 2014 numerically investigated the local scouring around two adjacent cylinders in side by side and tandem arrangements based on large eddy simulation les coupled with sediment transport and morphologic models their results showed that the turbulent structure and the scoured bed patterns are significantly influenced by the pile spacing in addition the scour hole dimensions apart from the scour depth such as the length and width of the holes are also important to identify the geometry of the scour hole in the practices of the scoured foundation protection the protection area needs to be determined based on the scour hole dimensions to create a reinforced layer around the pile group foundation nevertheless the study of the morphological characteristics of pile group scour holes is rather limited recently xu et al 2019 reported a wave flume experiment investigating scour induced by solitary waves at a breakwater supported by pile group foundations they examined the effects of wave height and water depth on the characteristic dimensions of the scour hole similarly solaimani et al 2017 analyzed the influence of pile spacing on the volume and area of the scour hole and provided empirical relationships for predicting the scour volume and area only in terms of the pile spacing but the flow parameters were not taken into account in this work flume experiments were carried out to study the scour in the vicinity of different pile groups under steady current conditions four kinds of pile group arrangements were considered including tandem two piles square 2 2 piles rectangular 2 3 piles and staggered piles the purposes of this study are 1 to study the temporal development of scour depth measured at different positions around piles 2 to reveal the influence of pile spacing g d and froude number fr on the equilibrium scour depth of pile groups 3 to explore the relationships between the characteristic dimensions of scour hole with g d and fr and 4 to obtain the empirical equations predicting the volume and plane area of the scour hole 2 experimental setup and procedures 2 1 experimental facility the present experiments were conducted in a flume 6 m long 0 25 m wide and 0 25 m deep located in the hydraulic laboratory of beijing jiaotong university the flume was filled with uniform quartz sand with specific mass ρ s 2650 kg m³ median diameter d 50 0 6 mm the pile groups were mounted vertically in the sediment bed approximately 4 m from the flume entrance where fully developed flow conditions were attained muzzammil and gangadhariah 2003 beheshti and ataie ashtiani 2016 each pile was modeled by a circular cylinder made from clear perspex tubes the flume and experimental setup are depicted in detail in fig 1 the origin of the cartesian coordinate system is defined as the center of the upstream pile on its bottom surface with the longitudinal x axis parallel to the flume bed the y axis normal to the side wall of the flume and z axis vertical to the bottom of the flume the flow was driven by a water pump and measured by an automatic controlling system composed of a frequency converter an electromagnetic flow meter and an ultrasonic water level meter the maximum flow discharge by the system can reach 36 m3 s with the accuracy of 0 01 m3 s there are two ways to control the flow discharge one is by adjusting the frequency of the frequency converter and the other is using a feedback mode to adjust the input flow to the target value the feedback mode was chosen for the present experiments in order to monitor the water surface elevation four water level gauges were arranged longitudinally along the flume with equal spacing the water level gauge is composed of an ultrasonic probe arranged above the water surface and an automatic water measurement system awms with the accuracy of 0 1 mm 2 2 experimental conditions in the current experiments four kinds of pile group arrangements were tested as seen in fig 2 including a tandem two piles b square 2 2 piles c rectangular 2 3 piles and d staggered piles in fig 2 d is the diameter of single cylinder and g is the face to face pile spacing which is kept constant in the longitudinal and transverse directions a total of 23 tests involving pile group scour were carried out and the experimental conditions together with the experimental results of final equilibrium scour depth are listed in table 1 test no 1 23 additionally six tests involving scour around a single pile were carried out test no 24 29 such that the results involving scour around pile groups can be compared with those of the single pile for all the cases of tandem two piles test no 1 7 and part of cases with single pile test no 27 29 the diameter of cylinder d 0 02 m and for the remaining cases d 0 01 m in order to explore the influence of flow conditions on the scour around pile groups experiments were carried out under seven flow conditions as summarized in table 1 where h is the water depth u is the bulk mean cross sectionally averaged velocity h eu and h ed are the equilibrium scour depth for the front and rear pile respectively θ is the shields number re h is the reynolds number based on approaching flow depth which is defined as follows 1 r e h u h ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of water and fr is the froude number of the approaching flow defined as 2 f r u g h in the present experiments the following functional relationship can be defined 3 f h e d d 50 ρ s ρ w g u g h ν 0 where h e is the maximum scour depth around the pile which is located at the front pile i e h e h eu according to the buckingham theory and selecting u d and ρ w as the basic variables we can get the following function with dimensionless parameters 4 f h e d d 50 d ρ s ρ w h d g d f r r e d 0 the value of d 50 d and ρ w ρ s are kept constant in the current experiments the parameter h d can be taken as the boundary layer thickness which limits the size of the horseshoe vortex in pile scour but it is only significant when the value is less than 3 larsen et al 2017 in this experiment h d 3 and thus it can be negligible the pile reynolds number re d ud ν is an important parameter influencing the horseshoe vortex around the pile however the range of re d in the present experiment is limited to 1800 5800 which results in a small difference in the size of the horseshoe vortex and therefore can be disregarded najafzadeh and barani 2014 in addition the pile reynolds number is not usually considered a significant parameter if the flow is fully turbulent ettema et al 1998 in the present experiments the flow reynolds number for most of cases is re h 104 as listed in table 1 indicating that the flow is turbulent and thus the effect of pile reynolds number re d can be ignored under these considerations eq 4 is reduced as 5 h e d f g d f r the dimensionless pile spacing g d is an important parameter of pile group the froude number fr as a representative flow parameter influencing the scour around monopiles or pile groups is normally considered and even included in the well known predictive equation i e federal highway administration hydraulic engineering circular no 18 hec 18 reported by arneson et al 2012 moreover when the froude number fr 0 2 its influence on scour is more significant due to an obvious change in the local surface elevation around the pile roulund et al 2005 and thus the parameter fr should be taken into account in the present experiment the blockage ratio i e flume width to diameter is approximately 6 3 which is near the lower limit of the acceptable range by referencing previous relevant studies dey and raikar 2007 the ratios of the flume width to the water depth are larger than 4 2 which is close to critical value of 5 that avoids the influence of the side walls on the central flow region nezu 2005 additionally in the recently published paper by the authors yang et al 2018b the velocity and turbulent stress distribution in vertical at roughly 0 5 m upstream from the pile group were measured the results showed that the streamwise velocity profile fits the log law profile theoretically and the turbulent stresses also fit well with the theoretical result which indicates a fully developed approaching flow is maintained 2 3 experimental procedure and measurements before conducting the experiments the sediment bed of the experimental area was kept flat and parallel to the bottom slope of the flume keeping the tailgate closed meanwhile the water was slowly filled from both the inlet and outlet of the flume to prevent scouring around the pile groups when the water depth was close to the desired value the inlet flow discharge was gradually increased to the target value meanwhile the tailgate was slowly opened to adjust the flow into a uniform and steady flow state and once the steady flow reached the target flow condition the scour test was started and this moment was defined as the initial time during the scouring process the variation of the scour depth around the different piles with time has been measured the measurement positions were selected as the azimuth of 0 90 180 and 270 in the clockwise direction of the cylinder fig 3 presents the horizontal layout of specific measurement points in the vicinity of the pile group of 2 2 arrangement with g d 1 in which the mark represents the measured locations for the scour depth a scale label is marked on the surface of the pile at the measurement positions to facilitate the direct observation of the scour depths during the scouring process regarding the equilibrium scour depth under steady current different criteria can be found in previous literature melville and chiew 1999 sheppard et al 2004 lança et al 2013 which may result in a different equilibrium time of scour qi et al 2018 in the current experiment we assume that the equilibrium scour depth is reached when the scour depth does not change in 2 h and the corresponding time is the equilibrium time the equilibrium time for each case is different under different flow conditions ranging from 5 to 8 h when the equilibrium state was obtained the inlet flow has been decreased gradually and the tailgate closed the water has then been drained very slowly to avoid any disturbance of the scoured bed kitsikoudis et al 2017 after the water was drained out the topography of scour hole was measured by a bed profiler the space resolution of the bed profiler is o 2 mm and the longitudinal scour profiles have been scanned at successive transverse locations at 5 mm increments since the geometry of the scour holes were reasonably symmetric about the symmetry plane of the pile group only half of the scour hole has been measured as shown in the shaded area in fig 3 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 temporal development of scour depth previous studies on the temporal development of the scour depth around a pile have mainly focused on a single pile yanmaz and altinbilek 1991 melville and chiew 1999 sumer and fredsøe 2002 sheppard et al 2004 the present experimental observation shows that the scouring process around pile group can be described as firstly the scour starts from the sides of the each pile due to the bending of the streamlines creating large amplification of the bed shear stress at the sides of the pile with scour development the bed shear stress at the sides reduces and the main driver of the scour process is no longer the contracted streamlines but the horseshoe vortex which results in the scour at the front of each pile becomes evident an independent inverted conical scour hole is formed around each pile at intermediate scour stages the scour hole of each pile gradually merges in the subsequent scour stage and even in the cases of higher fr a large general scour hole will be forms around the whole pile group the maximum scour depth for most cases occurs at the front of the upstream pile except for the cases with lower fr fr 0 254 and 0 256 of which the maximum scour depth occurs at the sides approximately 40 from the center line of the upstream pile fig 4 a d show the temporal variation of the scour depth h s for the cases of tandem piles and 2 2 piles with the pile spacing of g d 1 under different froude number fr the results at different azimuth around the pile group are displayed in each subplot in this figure the value of the scour depth h s at each measurement position is normalized by its respective equilibrium scour depth h e and the time t is normalized by the time scale t s which are calculated by integrating the scour curve according to larsen et al 2017 6 t s 0 t max h e h s h e d t in each case t s is integrated using the scour curve of the position where the maximum scour depth occurred in order to make a comparison the result of single pile is also included in fig 4 e and f it clearly shows that the scour depth develops fast in the initial stage and then the development becomes slow and finally tends to the equilibrium with the increase of fr the scour rate in the early stage is faster the time duration to the maximum scour depth around the pile group is different under different froude number here we used the time scale t s to represent the time duration and it shows that t s decreases with increasing fr this can be explained that for the cases with higher froude number means that the velocity is larger for a fixed water depth the scouring around piles will be more rapid and the scour development will be accelerated hence the required duration to reach the equilibrium scour is short additionally it shows that for the cases with lower froude number fr 0 256 the difference among the several curves of temporal scour depths at different locations is more distinct while for the cases with higher froude number fr 0 465 the different curves of scour depth at different positions are more close to the same curve this can be explained that for higher values of fr the influencing range on flow by each pile is large and the interaction between each pile is strong which results in the flow field induced by the pile group behaves more like that of a single but bigger pile hence the difference of scour depth development at different locations is small by referring to the previous research the temporal variation of scour depth can be expressed by an exponential function as follow simarro grande and martín vide 2004 7 h s h e 1 exp c 1 t t s c 2 c 1 c 2 0 where c 1 and c 2 are fitting coefficients which can be obtained by the experiment data in this work we obtained the fitting curves of the maximum scour depth development at both front pile and rear pile using eq 7 the calculated results for front and rear piles are respectively represented by the red and blue curves as shown in fig 4 in which the fitting coefficients c 1 and c 2 as well as the correlation coefficient r 2 are also included it shows that the calculated results agree well with the experimental data at the earlier scour stage the difference of scour depth between the front and rear pile is larger and becomes small with time fig 4 a d show that the fitting curves of the front pile and the rear pile are significantly different for small values of fr and the difference decreases with the increase of fr additionally an exponential relationship is found between c 1 and fr as shown in fig 5 which can be represented by the following equation 8a front pile c 1 0 856 exp 1 719 f r r 2 0 875 8b rear pile c 1 0 409 exp 2 839 f r r 2 0 886 it may be noted that eqs 8a and 8b are limited to the range of present study fr 0 254 0 465 actually the value of c 1 or c 2 determines the scour rate more specifically by increasing c 1 or c 2 the curve of scour development is shifted to the left indicating that the scour is more rapid see fig 1 of simarro grande and martín vide 2004 as discussed previously the scour development will be accelerated for the cases with higher fr which means that the value of c 1 or c 2 tends to be larger for the cases with higher fr this is also confirmed from fig 5 in which c 1 increases with fr the value of c 2 is usually considered as a constant e g 0 33 proposed by simarro grande and martín vide 2004 although it can vary according to flow conditions for the convenience of using this equation in practice c 2 can be regarded as a constant value in application in the present study the value of c 2 for the front pile and rear pile is approximately equal to 0 392 and 0 451 3 2 equilibrium scour depth fig 6 a and b demonstrate the equilibrium scour depth h e plotted against pile spacing g d for the case of tandem piles and 2 2 piles respectively in order to compare with single pile the value of scour depth is normalized by the scour depth of single pile under the same flow conditions which is expressed as h e h es the maximum scour depths at front and rear piles are both presented by solid and hollow points respectively the experimental data of kim et al 2014 2015 is also added in the figure for the present cases of tandem piles the equilibrium scour depth of the front pile is relatively large compared with that of single pile and it increases first and then decreases with pile spacing and the maximum appears at g d 3 for the case with fr 0 313 the scour depth of the rear pile is apparently smaller than that of front pile and also smaller than that of single pile i e h e h es 1 sumer et al 2005 pointed out that the horseshoe vortex around the upstream pile with strong intensity is the key factor that plays a leading role in local scour li et al 2018 additionally due to the shadowing effect of the front pile the horseshoe vortex becomes weakened around the rear pile which results in the relatively small local scour depth around rear piles in terms of the cases with 2 2 piles the equilibrium scour depth decreases with pile spacing within the range of pile spacing tested in the present study i e g d 1 2 moreover for all the cases of square 2 2 piles considered in this study the scour depth of front pile are larger than that of single pile while the scour depths of rear pile are larger than that of single pile only for the cases with higher froude number i e fr 0 333 and 0 465 in addition the distinct variation tendency of scour depth with g d between 2 2 figs 6b and 1 2 fig 6a pile groups indicates that the two extra piles on the side have great impact on the existing tandem piles regarding this point we can get some insights from the previous studies of scour around side by side piles ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 kim et al 2014 those results show that the scour depth for side by side piles is larger than that of single pile under same flow conditions in the other words the presence of lateral piles will increase the scour depth around the existing piles and the reasons are 1 the formation of jet like flow between the adjacent piles leading to acceleration of the flow and elevated turbulence and 2 the increased size of horseshoe vortex in front of the piles however with the increase of pile spacing the impact of lateral piles on the existing piles becomes weakened hence it exhibits that the equilibrium scour depth in the 2 2 piles fig 6b decreases as the pile spacing increases the relationship between the scour depth h e h es and the pile spacing g d under different fr is presented in fig 6 b in which the dotted line was obtained by fitting the experimental data regarding the influence of pile spacing on pile group scour the critical value of g d to determine the pile group effect was pointed out in the previous studies and this critical value of g d is related the flow conditions for example amini et al 2012 noted that when g d 3 5 each pile had individual scour hole which is independent from each other in their experiments the approach flow velocity is close to the threshold flow intensity u u c 0 95 and the froude number fr 0 13 hannah 1978 mentioned that when g d 11 the scour depth at the pile group is the same with the scour depth of single pile however the flow conditions in hannah 1978 s study was unknown due to the absence of detailed information on the flow data in the current study as shown in fig 6 b if we define the intersection of the horizontal gray line with the curved lines as the critical value of g d for a pile group effect it can be seen that the critical value of g d varies with fr tending to increase with the value of fr this is attributed to that the range of flow field influenced by each pile will be expanded for the case with higher froude number and thus larger pile spacing is needed to eliminate interaction of the flow between piles fig 7 shows the variation of maximum equilibrium scour depth located around front piles with respect to fr under different pile group arrangements it can be seen that the non dimensional scour depth h e d exhibits a general increasing tendency with fr additionally by comprising the results of different pile group arrangements we can find that the equilibrium scour depth of 2 3 piles is close to the staggered piles for the case of g d 1 5 for the four pile group with staggered arrangement the scour depth is relatively large compared to the scour of the square four pile group under the same pile spacing that is due to the equivalent width of pile group being larger when the angle of pile group to the approaching flow is 45 and thus the scour depth is correspondingly increased 3 3 scour hole morphology in order to visually investigate the geometry characteristics of the scour hole morphology fig 8 presents the equilibrium scour hole topography in the cases of 2 2 pile group with different froude number fr and different pile spacing g d it is obvious that the range of the pile group scour hole becomes larger as the fr increases for the same g d even though the scour holes have merged the separation of the scour hole is still observed between the cylinders the scour hole of the pile group can be divided into local scour at individual piles as well as global scour over the entire area of group in the form of a saucer shaped depression sumer et al 2005 fig 8 shows that the local scour is more significant when g d is larger and fr is lower moreover a sand ridge is formed at the upstream scour topography of the pile group in all the cases which is located at the central axis of the pile group this topographic feature is the resulted of the horseshoe vortex formed upstream of each pile not being completely integrated yang et al 2018a the downstream scour topography of the pile group is dependent on the value of fr and g d specifically when fr is small or g d is large see fig 8 a b and d two sand ridges are formed downstream of the pile group due to the regular shedding of the vortexes of the two rows of piles which are located at the central axis of each rear pile for the cases with large fr and smaller g d see fig 8 c the two separate ridges in the downstream of the rear pile merge to a single sand ridge which is located at the central axis of pile group this is due to the wake vortices of the two piles merging with each other such that it behaves like a single pair of wake vortices shedding regularly in the downstream of the pile hence it indicates that when g d is smaller and fr is larger the overall scour hole morphology of pile group is more similar to the case of single pile fig 9 shows the equilibrium scour hole topography under different fr in the form of 2 3 pile group with g d 1 the range of scour hole is relatively large compared to that of the 2 2 piles moreover the scour hole topography around the upstream two rows of the 2 3 piles is similar to the scour of the 2 2 pile groups which indicates that the existence of the third row of piles has little influence on the scour around the upstream two rows of piles in addition due to the shadowing effect of the upstream two rows of piles the scour around the third row of piles becomes smaller an obvious deposition phenomenon even appears in the case of small fr see fig 9 a to further explore the variations of scour morphology around the pile groups with pile spacing g d as well as froude number fr the scour profiles at different longitudinal and transverse sections for 2 2 group piles are extracted as shown in fig 10 section 1 and section 2 represent the longitudinal axial planes of the pile group and center planes of the piles respectively section 3 and section 4 represent the transverse center planes of the upstream piles and the downstream piles the longitudinal scour profile plotted in fig 11 illustrates the following features 1 the bed slope of the upstream scour hole is larger than that downstream and this feature is similar to the case of the single pile 2 with the increase of fr the overall depth and range of the scour hole increase and the scour profile slope approximately remains constant under the same pile spacing condition 3 with the increase of g d the scour depth presents a decreasing trend 4 the maximum scour depth is located at the front of the upstream pile the transverse scour profile plotted in fig 12 shows 1 the topography in the gap area between piles is convex and the maximum scour depth occurs near the pile due to the local scour at individual piles 2 the scour depth at the upstream piles is generally greater than that of the downstream piles 3 as the pile spacing g d increases the scour depth in the gap area of the piles decreases sumer et al 2005 noted that the jet like flow induced by the compression flow between piles gives rise to high flow velocity and elevated turbulence however with the increase of pile spacing the intensity of this jet like flow becomes weakened leading to the decrease of scour depth between piles 3 4 scour hole dimensions in order to further quantitatively analyze the scour hole dimensions under different pile spacing and flow conditions we defined three parameters to represent the geometric characteristics of scour hole as shown in fig 13 for details including 1 the length of the scour hole upstream of the pile group l u which represents the longitudinal distance from the front of the upstream pile to the upstream edge of the scour hole 2 the length of the scour hole downstream of the pile group l d which represents the longitudinal distance from the rear side of the downstream pile to the downstream edge of the scour hole 3 the width of the scour hole l w which represents the transverse distance from the axis of the scour hole to the edge of the scour hole fig 14 exhibits the variation of characteristic dimensions l u d l w d l d d of scour holes with pile spacing g d under different fr conditions it can be seen that the larger the fr the larger the value of each characteristic quantity this is consistent with the aforementioned results in section 3 3 that the range of the scour hole expands as fr increases the influence of pile spacing g d on each geometric characteristic is more complicated described as follows 1 the upstream length of scour hole l u d shows an increasing tendency with g d this can be explained as follows when the pile spacing is small the interaction effect between each pile is pronounced and the horseshoe vortex structure formed in front of the upstream pile is strong thus causing more intense scour and greater evolution distance in front of the pile 2 the downstream length of scour hole l w d increases slightly with the increase of g d it should be mentioned that the definition of l w as shown in fig 12 includes the distance between piles thus the value of g d is implicitly contained in the value of l w d 3 the variation of l d d with g d is not monotonic but dependent on the value of fr when fr is small l d d exhibits a decreasing trend with g d because the interaction of the wake vortex behind the pile is weakened when the pile spacing is larger sumer et al 2005 also mentioned that the flow field turbulence behind the pile is smaller as the pile spacing increase which may lead to the decrease of scour depth downstream of the pile nevertheless when the fr is large the effect of pile spacing g d on l d d is not obvious indicating that the flow field turbulence behind the pile is probably not the main factor causing the scour in the downstream area and the specific reasons need to be further investigated 3 5 scour hole area and volume the volume of removed material due to local scour is sometimes essential to fill the scour hole after a flood or scour event which can put a bridge at risk normally the time required to reach the maximum scouring area and volume does not exactly correspond to that of the maximum scour depth it was observed that the scour depth reaches to the maximum firstly due to the downflow in front of the pile afterwards the scour area evolves continually for a short duration due to sand sliding within the scour hole this phenomenon was also found by roulund et al 2005 hence the occurrence of the maximum scouring area volume was delayed compared to the maximum scouring depth here for the convenience we assumed that the maximum scouring area volume has reached when the maximum scour depth has reached the area and volume of the scour hole are calculated as follows 9 a s ω 1 d x d y 10 v s ω h e x y d x d y where h e x y is the scour depth corresponding its spatial position x y fig 15 shows the two parameters varied with pile spacing g d under different fr in which a s and v s are expressed in dimensionless form i e a s 1 4 π d 2 and v s 1 4 π d 3 it is obvious that both the scour area and volume increase with the increase of fr this relation of scour area and volume increasing with fr was also observed in the previous single pile scour experiment das et al 2014 regarding the influence of pile spacing the scour area shows a positive correlation with g d while the scour volume shows a negative correlation with g d as expected the scour area increases with pile spacing due to the expansion of scour hole the scour volume decreases with pile spacing mainly due to the decrease of the scour depth by fitting the experimental data two empirical relationships are obtained to predict the equilibrium scour hole area a s and volume v s around the pile groups as follows 11 a s 1 4 π d 2 1985 f r h 2 34 g d 0 35 m 0 07 r 2 0 815 12 v s 1 4 π d 3 4602 f r h 3 02 g d 0 34 m 0 07 r 2 0 834 where r 2 is the correlation coefficient m is the number of piles for the pile group the comparison of a s and v s between the results calculated using eqs 11 and 12 and measured results are presented in fig 16 it can be seen that the results are in good agreement it should be noted that eqs 11 and 12 are obtained based on the limited experimental data of the 2 2 and 2 3 pile groups in the present study which are suitable for the present flow and sediment conditions 4 conclusions in this study flume experiments were carried out to study the current induced scour around pile groups with different arrangements under different flow conditions mainly focusing on the influence of froude number fr and pile spacing g d the temporal development of scour depth was investigated the equilibrium scour hole morphology was described in detail and the characteristic dimensions of the resulting scour hole were thoroughly analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 the temporal development of the scour depth at the front pile and the rear pile are significantly different for small values of fr and the difference decreases with the increase of fr an exponential equation can be used to quantitatively describe the temporal variation of scour depth 2 the scour depth at the downstream pile is apparently smaller than that of upstream pile the equilibrium scour depth decreases with pile spacing the critical g d value representing pile group effect tends to increase with the value of fr 3 the scour around the pile group can be divided into local scour at individual pile and global scour over entire area of pile group and the local scour is less obvious with the increase of fr the scour depth between the cylinders decreases as the g d increases which is related to the jet like flow induced by the compression of piles 4 the length of the scour hole upstream of the pile group l u d decreases with g d while the width of the scour hole l w d shows a slightly increasing trend with g d the variation of l d d with g d is not monotonic but related to the value of fr empirical relationships are obtained to predict the equilibrium scour hole area and volume around pile groups acknowledgments this study is financially supported by the national

22281,this paper presents comprehensive experimental results of scour around pile groups with different pile arrangements under different steady flow conditions with the main aim of analyzing the influence of pile spacing g d and froude number fr the temporal developments of scour depth measured at different positions around different piles are provided and yield exponential functions the temporal variations of scour depth at the front pile and the rear pile are significantly different for small values of fr the equilibrium scour depth of pile groups decreases with g d and the scour depth at the rear pile is apparently smaller than that at the front pile the critical value of g d representing the pile group effect tends to increase with fr the equilibrium scour topography is divided into local scour at individual pile and global scour over entire area of pile group and the local scour is less obvious with the increase of fr additionally the results of scour hole dimensions show that the length of the scour hole upstream of the pile group decreases with g d while the width of the scour hole increases slightly with g d finally empirical relationships are obtained to predict the equilibrium scour hole area and volume keywords pile group local scour froude number pile spacing temporal variation scour hole topography 1 introduction pile group is one of the commonly used foundations in offshore structures such as platforms wind turbines bridges etc pile group changes the flow pattern in their immediate surrounding which may cause an increase in the local sediment transport capacity resulting in local scour at the seabed around these structures scour around pile group foundations can undermine the stability of the structures and thus needs to be concerned however compared with the large number of studies on scour around monopile melville and coleman 2000 sumer and fredsøe 2002 or single pier liang et al 2013 qi et al 2016 2018 studies on scouring around pile groups are relatively limited in fact the structural complexity of pile group results in the flow field around the structures being more complicated sumner 2010 ataie ashtiani and aslani kordkandi 2013 the associated sediment transport and scouring process around the pile group are in turn more complex thus the understanding of which requires further investigation in the past several decades the relevant studies on pile group scour have mainly focused on the equilibrium scour depth as well as further exploring the influence of some governing variables and establishing empirical equations to predict the equilibrium scour depth sumer and fredsøe 1998 bayram and larson 2000 baghbadorani et al 2018 sumer and fredsøe 2002 pointed out that due to the flow interference between adjacent piles the scour around pile group is obviously different from that occurring around a single pile ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 derived a correction factor for inclusion in predictive equations to consider the influence of pile group arrangements amini et al 2012 studied the influence of pile spacing pile group arrangements uniform or non uniform spacing and submergence ratios in steady current lança et al 2013 investigated the influence of scour duration skew angle and number of pile group columns on the scour patterns and equilibrium scour depth liang et al 2017 conducted flume experiments of clear water scour using single pile tandem piles side by side piles and 3 3 pile groups and evaluated existing predictive equations by comparing with the experimental data in addition many numerical models have been recently proposed or used to predict scour depth around pile groups such as group method of data handling gmdh and neuro fuzzy gmdh najafzadeh and barani 2011 najafzadeh and azamathulla 2013 najafzadeh 2015 najafzadeh et al 2013 in general the previous studies mainly focused on the influence of the parameters of pile groups such as pile spacing pile arrangement and the skew angle with respect to the flow direction while ignoring the influence of flow parameters under a certain pile arrangement wang et al 2016 the flow structure e g turbulent vortex around individual piles in a group affects each other and this effect can be neglected when the pile spacing exceeds a certain critical value for example hannah 1978 mentioned that when g d 11 the scour depth at the pile group is the same with the scour depth of single pile which implies that the pile group effect can be neglected however amini et al 2012 pointed out that when g d 3 5 each pile had individual scour hole which is independent from each other zhang et al 2017 found that the interactions between the piles are almost non existent when g d 4 the proposed different result on the criterion of the critical value of g d is due to the different flow conditions considered in these experiments it is therefore that the influence of pile spacing under different flow conditions needs to be further studied due to the complex interaction between piles with turbulence in pile groups the morphology of the scour hole around pile groups exhibits different characteristics under different pile spacing and flow conditions liang et al 2013 vaghefi et al 2018 this is due to the varying turbulence structure within the scour hole implying that the mechanism of scour may be different for example sumer et al 2005 experimentally investigated scour around pile groups with different configurations exposed to steady current and pointed out that scour around pile groups is caused by two mechanisms those causing local scour at individual piles and those causing a global scour the general lowering of the bed over the entire area of the pile group kim et al 2014 numerically investigated the local scouring around two adjacent cylinders in side by side and tandem arrangements based on large eddy simulation les coupled with sediment transport and morphologic models their results showed that the turbulent structure and the scoured bed patterns are significantly influenced by the pile spacing in addition the scour hole dimensions apart from the scour depth such as the length and width of the holes are also important to identify the geometry of the scour hole in the practices of the scoured foundation protection the protection area needs to be determined based on the scour hole dimensions to create a reinforced layer around the pile group foundation nevertheless the study of the morphological characteristics of pile group scour holes is rather limited recently xu et al 2019 reported a wave flume experiment investigating scour induced by solitary waves at a breakwater supported by pile group foundations they examined the effects of wave height and water depth on the characteristic dimensions of the scour hole similarly solaimani et al 2017 analyzed the influence of pile spacing on the volume and area of the scour hole and provided empirical relationships for predicting the scour volume and area only in terms of the pile spacing but the flow parameters were not taken into account in this work flume experiments were carried out to study the scour in the vicinity of different pile groups under steady current conditions four kinds of pile group arrangements were considered including tandem two piles square 2 2 piles rectangular 2 3 piles and staggered piles the purposes of this study are 1 to study the temporal development of scour depth measured at different positions around piles 2 to reveal the influence of pile spacing g d and froude number fr on the equilibrium scour depth of pile groups 3 to explore the relationships between the characteristic dimensions of scour hole with g d and fr and 4 to obtain the empirical equations predicting the volume and plane area of the scour hole 2 experimental setup and procedures 2 1 experimental facility the present experiments were conducted in a flume 6 m long 0 25 m wide and 0 25 m deep located in the hydraulic laboratory of beijing jiaotong university the flume was filled with uniform quartz sand with specific mass ρ s 2650 kg m³ median diameter d 50 0 6 mm the pile groups were mounted vertically in the sediment bed approximately 4 m from the flume entrance where fully developed flow conditions were attained muzzammil and gangadhariah 2003 beheshti and ataie ashtiani 2016 each pile was modeled by a circular cylinder made from clear perspex tubes the flume and experimental setup are depicted in detail in fig 1 the origin of the cartesian coordinate system is defined as the center of the upstream pile on its bottom surface with the longitudinal x axis parallel to the flume bed the y axis normal to the side wall of the flume and z axis vertical to the bottom of the flume the flow was driven by a water pump and measured by an automatic controlling system composed of a frequency converter an electromagnetic flow meter and an ultrasonic water level meter the maximum flow discharge by the system can reach 36 m3 s with the accuracy of 0 01 m3 s there are two ways to control the flow discharge one is by adjusting the frequency of the frequency converter and the other is using a feedback mode to adjust the input flow to the target value the feedback mode was chosen for the present experiments in order to monitor the water surface elevation four water level gauges were arranged longitudinally along the flume with equal spacing the water level gauge is composed of an ultrasonic probe arranged above the water surface and an automatic water measurement system awms with the accuracy of 0 1 mm 2 2 experimental conditions in the current experiments four kinds of pile group arrangements were tested as seen in fig 2 including a tandem two piles b square 2 2 piles c rectangular 2 3 piles and d staggered piles in fig 2 d is the diameter of single cylinder and g is the face to face pile spacing which is kept constant in the longitudinal and transverse directions a total of 23 tests involving pile group scour were carried out and the experimental conditions together with the experimental results of final equilibrium scour depth are listed in table 1 test no 1 23 additionally six tests involving scour around a single pile were carried out test no 24 29 such that the results involving scour around pile groups can be compared with those of the single pile for all the cases of tandem two piles test no 1 7 and part of cases with single pile test no 27 29 the diameter of cylinder d 0 02 m and for the remaining cases d 0 01 m in order to explore the influence of flow conditions on the scour around pile groups experiments were carried out under seven flow conditions as summarized in table 1 where h is the water depth u is the bulk mean cross sectionally averaged velocity h eu and h ed are the equilibrium scour depth for the front and rear pile respectively θ is the shields number re h is the reynolds number based on approaching flow depth which is defined as follows 1 r e h u h ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of water and fr is the froude number of the approaching flow defined as 2 f r u g h in the present experiments the following functional relationship can be defined 3 f h e d d 50 ρ s ρ w g u g h ν 0 where h e is the maximum scour depth around the pile which is located at the front pile i e h e h eu according to the buckingham theory and selecting u d and ρ w as the basic variables we can get the following function with dimensionless parameters 4 f h e d d 50 d ρ s ρ w h d g d f r r e d 0 the value of d 50 d and ρ w ρ s are kept constant in the current experiments the parameter h d can be taken as the boundary layer thickness which limits the size of the horseshoe vortex in pile scour but it is only significant when the value is less than 3 larsen et al 2017 in this experiment h d 3 and thus it can be negligible the pile reynolds number re d ud ν is an important parameter influencing the horseshoe vortex around the pile however the range of re d in the present experiment is limited to 1800 5800 which results in a small difference in the size of the horseshoe vortex and therefore can be disregarded najafzadeh and barani 2014 in addition the pile reynolds number is not usually considered a significant parameter if the flow is fully turbulent ettema et al 1998 in the present experiments the flow reynolds number for most of cases is re h 104 as listed in table 1 indicating that the flow is turbulent and thus the effect of pile reynolds number re d can be ignored under these considerations eq 4 is reduced as 5 h e d f g d f r the dimensionless pile spacing g d is an important parameter of pile group the froude number fr as a representative flow parameter influencing the scour around monopiles or pile groups is normally considered and even included in the well known predictive equation i e federal highway administration hydraulic engineering circular no 18 hec 18 reported by arneson et al 2012 moreover when the froude number fr 0 2 its influence on scour is more significant due to an obvious change in the local surface elevation around the pile roulund et al 2005 and thus the parameter fr should be taken into account in the present experiment the blockage ratio i e flume width to diameter is approximately 6 3 which is near the lower limit of the acceptable range by referencing previous relevant studies dey and raikar 2007 the ratios of the flume width to the water depth are larger than 4 2 which is close to critical value of 5 that avoids the influence of the side walls on the central flow region nezu 2005 additionally in the recently published paper by the authors yang et al 2018b the velocity and turbulent stress distribution in vertical at roughly 0 5 m upstream from the pile group were measured the results showed that the streamwise velocity profile fits the log law profile theoretically and the turbulent stresses also fit well with the theoretical result which indicates a fully developed approaching flow is maintained 2 3 experimental procedure and measurements before conducting the experiments the sediment bed of the experimental area was kept flat and parallel to the bottom slope of the flume keeping the tailgate closed meanwhile the water was slowly filled from both the inlet and outlet of the flume to prevent scouring around the pile groups when the water depth was close to the desired value the inlet flow discharge was gradually increased to the target value meanwhile the tailgate was slowly opened to adjust the flow into a uniform and steady flow state and once the steady flow reached the target flow condition the scour test was started and this moment was defined as the initial time during the scouring process the variation of the scour depth around the different piles with time has been measured the measurement positions were selected as the azimuth of 0 90 180 and 270 in the clockwise direction of the cylinder fig 3 presents the horizontal layout of specific measurement points in the vicinity of the pile group of 2 2 arrangement with g d 1 in which the mark represents the measured locations for the scour depth a scale label is marked on the surface of the pile at the measurement positions to facilitate the direct observation of the scour depths during the scouring process regarding the equilibrium scour depth under steady current different criteria can be found in previous literature melville and chiew 1999 sheppard et al 2004 lança et al 2013 which may result in a different equilibrium time of scour qi et al 2018 in the current experiment we assume that the equilibrium scour depth is reached when the scour depth does not change in 2 h and the corresponding time is the equilibrium time the equilibrium time for each case is different under different flow conditions ranging from 5 to 8 h when the equilibrium state was obtained the inlet flow has been decreased gradually and the tailgate closed the water has then been drained very slowly to avoid any disturbance of the scoured bed kitsikoudis et al 2017 after the water was drained out the topography of scour hole was measured by a bed profiler the space resolution of the bed profiler is o 2 mm and the longitudinal scour profiles have been scanned at successive transverse locations at 5 mm increments since the geometry of the scour holes were reasonably symmetric about the symmetry plane of the pile group only half of the scour hole has been measured as shown in the shaded area in fig 3 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 temporal development of scour depth previous studies on the temporal development of the scour depth around a pile have mainly focused on a single pile yanmaz and altinbilek 1991 melville and chiew 1999 sumer and fredsøe 2002 sheppard et al 2004 the present experimental observation shows that the scouring process around pile group can be described as firstly the scour starts from the sides of the each pile due to the bending of the streamlines creating large amplification of the bed shear stress at the sides of the pile with scour development the bed shear stress at the sides reduces and the main driver of the scour process is no longer the contracted streamlines but the horseshoe vortex which results in the scour at the front of each pile becomes evident an independent inverted conical scour hole is formed around each pile at intermediate scour stages the scour hole of each pile gradually merges in the subsequent scour stage and even in the cases of higher fr a large general scour hole will be forms around the whole pile group the maximum scour depth for most cases occurs at the front of the upstream pile except for the cases with lower fr fr 0 254 and 0 256 of which the maximum scour depth occurs at the sides approximately 40 from the center line of the upstream pile fig 4 a d show the temporal variation of the scour depth h s for the cases of tandem piles and 2 2 piles with the pile spacing of g d 1 under different froude number fr the results at different azimuth around the pile group are displayed in each subplot in this figure the value of the scour depth h s at each measurement position is normalized by its respective equilibrium scour depth h e and the time t is normalized by the time scale t s which are calculated by integrating the scour curve according to larsen et al 2017 6 t s 0 t max h e h s h e d t in each case t s is integrated using the scour curve of the position where the maximum scour depth occurred in order to make a comparison the result of single pile is also included in fig 4 e and f it clearly shows that the scour depth develops fast in the initial stage and then the development becomes slow and finally tends to the equilibrium with the increase of fr the scour rate in the early stage is faster the time duration to the maximum scour depth around the pile group is different under different froude number here we used the time scale t s to represent the time duration and it shows that t s decreases with increasing fr this can be explained that for the cases with higher froude number means that the velocity is larger for a fixed water depth the scouring around piles will be more rapid and the scour development will be accelerated hence the required duration to reach the equilibrium scour is short additionally it shows that for the cases with lower froude number fr 0 256 the difference among the several curves of temporal scour depths at different locations is more distinct while for the cases with higher froude number fr 0 465 the different curves of scour depth at different positions are more close to the same curve this can be explained that for higher values of fr the influencing range on flow by each pile is large and the interaction between each pile is strong which results in the flow field induced by the pile group behaves more like that of a single but bigger pile hence the difference of scour depth development at different locations is small by referring to the previous research the temporal variation of scour depth can be expressed by an exponential function as follow simarro grande and martín vide 2004 7 h s h e 1 exp c 1 t t s c 2 c 1 c 2 0 where c 1 and c 2 are fitting coefficients which can be obtained by the experiment data in this work we obtained the fitting curves of the maximum scour depth development at both front pile and rear pile using eq 7 the calculated results for front and rear piles are respectively represented by the red and blue curves as shown in fig 4 in which the fitting coefficients c 1 and c 2 as well as the correlation coefficient r 2 are also included it shows that the calculated results agree well with the experimental data at the earlier scour stage the difference of scour depth between the front and rear pile is larger and becomes small with time fig 4 a d show that the fitting curves of the front pile and the rear pile are significantly different for small values of fr and the difference decreases with the increase of fr additionally an exponential relationship is found between c 1 and fr as shown in fig 5 which can be represented by the following equation 8a front pile c 1 0 856 exp 1 719 f r r 2 0 875 8b rear pile c 1 0 409 exp 2 839 f r r 2 0 886 it may be noted that eqs 8a and 8b are limited to the range of present study fr 0 254 0 465 actually the value of c 1 or c 2 determines the scour rate more specifically by increasing c 1 or c 2 the curve of scour development is shifted to the left indicating that the scour is more rapid see fig 1 of simarro grande and martín vide 2004 as discussed previously the scour development will be accelerated for the cases with higher fr which means that the value of c 1 or c 2 tends to be larger for the cases with higher fr this is also confirmed from fig 5 in which c 1 increases with fr the value of c 2 is usually considered as a constant e g 0 33 proposed by simarro grande and martín vide 2004 although it can vary according to flow conditions for the convenience of using this equation in practice c 2 can be regarded as a constant value in application in the present study the value of c 2 for the front pile and rear pile is approximately equal to 0 392 and 0 451 3 2 equilibrium scour depth fig 6 a and b demonstrate the equilibrium scour depth h e plotted against pile spacing g d for the case of tandem piles and 2 2 piles respectively in order to compare with single pile the value of scour depth is normalized by the scour depth of single pile under the same flow conditions which is expressed as h e h es the maximum scour depths at front and rear piles are both presented by solid and hollow points respectively the experimental data of kim et al 2014 2015 is also added in the figure for the present cases of tandem piles the equilibrium scour depth of the front pile is relatively large compared with that of single pile and it increases first and then decreases with pile spacing and the maximum appears at g d 3 for the case with fr 0 313 the scour depth of the rear pile is apparently smaller than that of front pile and also smaller than that of single pile i e h e h es 1 sumer et al 2005 pointed out that the horseshoe vortex around the upstream pile with strong intensity is the key factor that plays a leading role in local scour li et al 2018 additionally due to the shadowing effect of the front pile the horseshoe vortex becomes weakened around the rear pile which results in the relatively small local scour depth around rear piles in terms of the cases with 2 2 piles the equilibrium scour depth decreases with pile spacing within the range of pile spacing tested in the present study i e g d 1 2 moreover for all the cases of square 2 2 piles considered in this study the scour depth of front pile are larger than that of single pile while the scour depths of rear pile are larger than that of single pile only for the cases with higher froude number i e fr 0 333 and 0 465 in addition the distinct variation tendency of scour depth with g d between 2 2 figs 6b and 1 2 fig 6a pile groups indicates that the two extra piles on the side have great impact on the existing tandem piles regarding this point we can get some insights from the previous studies of scour around side by side piles ataie ashtiani and beheshti 2006 kim et al 2014 those results show that the scour depth for side by side piles is larger than that of single pile under same flow conditions in the other words the presence of lateral piles will increase the scour depth around the existing piles and the reasons are 1 the formation of jet like flow between the adjacent piles leading to acceleration of the flow and elevated turbulence and 2 the increased size of horseshoe vortex in front of the piles however with the increase of pile spacing the impact of lateral piles on the existing piles becomes weakened hence it exhibits that the equilibrium scour depth in the 2 2 piles fig 6b decreases as the pile spacing increases the relationship between the scour depth h e h es and the pile spacing g d under different fr is presented in fig 6 b in which the dotted line was obtained by fitting the experimental data regarding the influence of pile spacing on pile group scour the critical value of g d to determine the pile group effect was pointed out in the previous studies and this critical value of g d is related the flow conditions for example amini et al 2012 noted that when g d 3 5 each pile had individual scour hole which is independent from each other in their experiments the approach flow velocity is close to the threshold flow intensity u u c 0 95 and the froude number fr 0 13 hannah 1978 mentioned that when g d 11 the scour depth at the pile group is the same with the scour depth of single pile however the flow conditions in hannah 1978 s study was unknown due to the absence of detailed information on the flow data in the current study as shown in fig 6 b if we define the intersection of the horizontal gray line with the curved lines as the critical value of g d for a pile group effect it can be seen that the critical value of g d varies with fr tending to increase with the value of fr this is attributed to that the range of flow field influenced by each pile will be expanded for the case with higher froude number and thus larger pile spacing is needed to eliminate interaction of the flow between piles fig 7 shows the variation of maximum equilibrium scour depth located around front piles with respect to fr under different pile group arrangements it can be seen that the non dimensional scour depth h e d exhibits a general increasing tendency with fr additionally by comprising the results of different pile group arrangements we can find that the equilibrium scour depth of 2 3 piles is close to the staggered piles for the case of g d 1 5 for the four pile group with staggered arrangement the scour depth is relatively large compared to the scour of the square four pile group under the same pile spacing that is due to the equivalent width of pile group being larger when the angle of pile group to the approaching flow is 45 and thus the scour depth is correspondingly increased 3 3 scour hole morphology in order to visually investigate the geometry characteristics of the scour hole morphology fig 8 presents the equilibrium scour hole topography in the cases of 2 2 pile group with different froude number fr and different pile spacing g d it is obvious that the range of the pile group scour hole becomes larger as the fr increases for the same g d even though the scour holes have merged the separation of the scour hole is still observed between the cylinders the scour hole of the pile group can be divided into local scour at individual piles as well as global scour over the entire area of group in the form of a saucer shaped depression sumer et al 2005 fig 8 shows that the local scour is more significant when g d is larger and fr is lower moreover a sand ridge is formed at the upstream scour topography of the pile group in all the cases which is located at the central axis of the pile group this topographic feature is the resulted of the horseshoe vortex formed upstream of each pile not being completely integrated yang et al 2018a the downstream scour topography of the pile group is dependent on the value of fr and g d specifically when fr is small or g d is large see fig 8 a b and d two sand ridges are formed downstream of the pile group due to the regular shedding of the vortexes of the two rows of piles which are located at the central axis of each rear pile for the cases with large fr and smaller g d see fig 8 c the two separate ridges in the downstream of the rear pile merge to a single sand ridge which is located at the central axis of pile group this is due to the wake vortices of the two piles merging with each other such that it behaves like a single pair of wake vortices shedding regularly in the downstream of the pile hence it indicates that when g d is smaller and fr is larger the overall scour hole morphology of pile group is more similar to the case of single pile fig 9 shows the equilibrium scour hole topography under different fr in the form of 2 3 pile group with g d 1 the range of scour hole is relatively large compared to that of the 2 2 piles moreover the scour hole topography around the upstream two rows of the 2 3 piles is similar to the scour of the 2 2 pile groups which indicates that the existence of the third row of piles has little influence on the scour around the upstream two rows of piles in addition due to the shadowing effect of the upstream two rows of piles the scour around the third row of piles becomes smaller an obvious deposition phenomenon even appears in the case of small fr see fig 9 a to further explore the variations of scour morphology around the pile groups with pile spacing g d as well as froude number fr the scour profiles at different longitudinal and transverse sections for 2 2 group piles are extracted as shown in fig 10 section 1 and section 2 represent the longitudinal axial planes of the pile group and center planes of the piles respectively section 3 and section 4 represent the transverse center planes of the upstream piles and the downstream piles the longitudinal scour profile plotted in fig 11 illustrates the following features 1 the bed slope of the upstream scour hole is larger than that downstream and this feature is similar to the case of the single pile 2 with the increase of fr the overall depth and range of the scour hole increase and the scour profile slope approximately remains constant under the same pile spacing condition 3 with the increase of g d the scour depth presents a decreasing trend 4 the maximum scour depth is located at the front of the upstream pile the transverse scour profile plotted in fig 12 shows 1 the topography in the gap area between piles is convex and the maximum scour depth occurs near the pile due to the local scour at individual piles 2 the scour depth at the upstream piles is generally greater than that of the downstream piles 3 as the pile spacing g d increases the scour depth in the gap area of the piles decreases sumer et al 2005 noted that the jet like flow induced by the compression flow between piles gives rise to high flow velocity and elevated turbulence however with the increase of pile spacing the intensity of this jet like flow becomes weakened leading to the decrease of scour depth between piles 3 4 scour hole dimensions in order to further quantitatively analyze the scour hole dimensions under different pile spacing and flow conditions we defined three parameters to represent the geometric characteristics of scour hole as shown in fig 13 for details including 1 the length of the scour hole upstream of the pile group l u which represents the longitudinal distance from the front of the upstream pile to the upstream edge of the scour hole 2 the length of the scour hole downstream of the pile group l d which represents the longitudinal distance from the rear side of the downstream pile to the downstream edge of the scour hole 3 the width of the scour hole l w which represents the transverse distance from the axis of the scour hole to the edge of the scour hole fig 14 exhibits the variation of characteristic dimensions l u d l w d l d d of scour holes with pile spacing g d under different fr conditions it can be seen that the larger the fr the larger the value of each characteristic quantity this is consistent with the aforementioned results in section 3 3 that the range of the scour hole expands as fr increases the influence of pile spacing g d on each geometric characteristic is more complicated described as follows 1 the upstream length of scour hole l u d shows an increasing tendency with g d this can be explained as follows when the pile spacing is small the interaction effect between each pile is pronounced and the horseshoe vortex structure formed in front of the upstream pile is strong thus causing more intense scour and greater evolution distance in front of the pile 2 the downstream length of scour hole l w d increases slightly with the increase of g d it should be mentioned that the definition of l w as shown in fig 12 includes the distance between piles thus the value of g d is implicitly contained in the value of l w d 3 the variation of l d d with g d is not monotonic but dependent on the value of fr when fr is small l d d exhibits a decreasing trend with g d because the interaction of the wake vortex behind the pile is weakened when the pile spacing is larger sumer et al 2005 also mentioned that the flow field turbulence behind the pile is smaller as the pile spacing increase which may lead to the decrease of scour depth downstream of the pile nevertheless when the fr is large the effect of pile spacing g d on l d d is not obvious indicating that the flow field turbulence behind the pile is probably not the main factor causing the scour in the downstream area and the specific reasons need to be further investigated 3 5 scour hole area and volume the volume of removed material due to local scour is sometimes essential to fill the scour hole after a flood or scour event which can put a bridge at risk normally the time required to reach the maximum scouring area and volume does not exactly correspond to that of the maximum scour depth it was observed that the scour depth reaches to the maximum firstly due to the downflow in front of the pile afterwards the scour area evolves continually for a short duration due to sand sliding within the scour hole this phenomenon was also found by roulund et al 2005 hence the occurrence of the maximum scouring area volume was delayed compared to the maximum scouring depth here for the convenience we assumed that the maximum scouring area volume has reached when the maximum scour depth has reached the area and volume of the scour hole are calculated as follows 9 a s ω 1 d x d y 10 v s ω h e x y d x d y where h e x y is the scour depth corresponding its spatial position x y fig 15 shows the two parameters varied with pile spacing g d under different fr in which a s and v s are expressed in dimensionless form i e a s 1 4 π d 2 and v s 1 4 π d 3 it is obvious that both the scour area and volume increase with the increase of fr this relation of scour area and volume increasing with fr was also observed in the previous single pile scour experiment das et al 2014 regarding the influence of pile spacing the scour area shows a positive correlation with g d while the scour volume shows a negative correlation with g d as expected the scour area increases with pile spacing due to the expansion of scour hole the scour volume decreases with pile spacing mainly due to the decrease of the scour depth by fitting the experimental data two empirical relationships are obtained to predict the equilibrium scour hole area a s and volume v s around the pile groups as follows 11 a s 1 4 π d 2 1985 f r h 2 34 g d 0 35 m 0 07 r 2 0 815 12 v s 1 4 π d 3 4602 f r h 3 02 g d 0 34 m 0 07 r 2 0 834 where r 2 is the correlation coefficient m is the number of piles for the pile group the comparison of a s and v s between the results calculated using eqs 11 and 12 and measured results are presented in fig 16 it can be seen that the results are in good agreement it should be noted that eqs 11 and 12 are obtained based on the limited experimental data of the 2 2 and 2 3 pile groups in the present study which are suitable for the present flow and sediment conditions 4 conclusions in this study flume experiments were carried out to study the current induced scour around pile groups with different arrangements under different flow conditions mainly focusing on the influence of froude number fr and pile spacing g d the temporal development of scour depth was investigated the equilibrium scour hole morphology was described in detail and the characteristic dimensions of the resulting scour hole were thoroughly analyzed the main conclusions are as follows 1 the temporal development of the scour depth at the front pile and the rear pile are significantly different for small values of fr and the difference decreases with the increase of fr an exponential equation can be used to quantitatively describe the temporal variation of scour depth 2 the scour depth at the downstream pile is apparently smaller than that of upstream pile the equilibrium scour depth decreases with pile spacing the critical g d value representing pile group effect tends to increase with the value of fr 3 the scour around the pile group can be divided into local scour at individual pile and global scour over entire area of pile group and the local scour is less obvious with the increase of fr the scour depth between the cylinders decreases as the g d increases which is related to the jet like flow induced by the compression of piles 4 the length of the scour hole upstream of the pile group l u d decreases with g d while the width of the scour hole l w d shows a slightly increasing trend with g d the variation of l d d with g d is not monotonic but related to the value of fr empirical relationships are obtained to predict the equilibrium scour hole area and volume around pile groups acknowledgments this study is financially supported by the national

22282,mooring systems are under a cyclic loading process caused by the randomness of metocean conditions which could lead to a fatigue failure of the station keeping system the present paper presents an innovative methodology for the assessment of floating offshore wind turbine mooring system fatigue considering the full lifetime of the structure the method integrates the impact of the life cycle metocean conditions over the dynamic performance of the platform thanks to coupled numerical models selection and non linear data interpolation techniques and commonly accepted fatigue approaches one of the benefits of using this methodology is that there are no uncertainties due to the selection of a reduced set of sea states the methodology is applied to a set of moorings with different properties in the deepcwind platform to evaluate the solution which offers the best compromise between size and fatigue damage results show that the best long term mooring behaviour is achieved with a weight of approximately 300 kg m a comparison is conducted between the fatigue damage obtained through the life cycle method and conventional methods the mean differences observed between the standard and the new method proposed are between 13 and 49 depending on the use of the s n or t n curves keywords fatigue mooring system floating offshore wind turbine non linear interpolation techniques 1 introduction wind industry has experienced a huge growth in recent years motivated by the need for energy sources alternative to fossil fuels in particular offshore wind energy technology evidences important potential in the coming years in fact this trend is being led by the european union with a total installed offshore wind capacity of 15 780 mw in 2017 wind europe 2018a the dominant substructures in offshore wind farms are fixed foundations including monopiles jackets and gravity base foundations wind europe 2018a however new technological advances point to offshore floating wind farms in intermediate and deep waters these new solutions are an opportunity for countries with important wind resources but with narrow continental shelves hywind scotland was the first floating offshore wind farm in the world with a total of five floating spar buoys installed in 2017 after this success and according to european policies floating offshore wind farms could provide between 4 and 5 gw by 2030 wind europe 2018b floating offshore wind turbines fowts in comparison with fixed foundations have a higher level of design complexity despite the system stability is mainly driven by the floating platform characteristics the mooring system plays a critical role in the design of structure motions and natural periods hence station keeping systems based on mooring lines and anchors are crucial to guarantee structure survivability and its components e g power cable under different metocean conditions traditionally a successful mooring design considers several limit states ls dnvgl os e301 2018 as follows ultimate uls accidental als fatigue fls and service sls these limit states contribute to properly ensuring the resistance of the mooring and its service criteria this article is focused on the analysis of fatigue loads fls on the mooring lines of a fowt moorings are under continuous cyclic metocean loads therefore fatigue damage is a potential failure mechanism fatigue damage can be evaluated by means of either an s n or a t n curve these curves relate a constant stress s or tension t range with the maximum number of cycles until component failure n numerous investigations have been conducted since the 1980s to understand the fatigue failure mechanism of offshore mooring chains building on prior research on this topic van helvoirt van helvoirt 1982 described an experimental test campaign related to the static and fatigue strength of stud link chains and connecting links under high load cycles in the marine environment lereim 1985 presented a complete study of chain reliability including experimental and numerical assessments he proposed an s n curve for chain links based on a fatigue crack propagation analysis for a corrosive environment assuming different initial surface crack depths the american petroleum institute api api rp 2fp1 1993 proposed a standard based on a normalised tension range to define the fatigue lifetime for each mooring component different t n curves are defined according to floating offshore structure experiments later det norske veritas dnv dnv os e301 2001 published different design s n curves to estimate the fatigue life these two standards are widely used as references for fatigue design by industry and researchers lassen and syvertsen 1997 xue et al 2018 thies et al 2014 as has been shown early investigations have been focused on building fatigue damage curves to allow a safe mooring design currently the mooring integrity management is a current topic among researchers and engineers issues such as residual stress anomalous loading modes or corrosion are receiving increased awareness by the offshore industry martinez et al 2017 estimated how residual stresses generated during the manufacturing process contribute to the fatigue life of mooring chains depending on the loading mode rampi et al 2015 described a new fatigue mechanism based on a combination of high pretension levels and motions generating out of plane bending fatigue loading and proposed a new s n fatigue curve diagram gabrielsen et al 2018 conducted mooring fatigue tests considering surface roughness corrosion pits and mean loads using chain segments recovered from a floating structure in the north sea their results concluded that the degradation of the chains reduces the fatigue capacity although the fatigue design capacity is still above the s n design curve given by dnvgl os e301 2018 as seen in the previous literature review a complete analysis of the different mechanisms that induce mooring fatigue already has been carried out however there are significantly less investigations of long term fatigue performance evaluation traditionally a set of environmental states is chosen to discretise the long term environmental conditions occurrence matrix dnvgl os e301 2018 api 2008 but this selection may affect the long term fatigue life of mooring chains of fowts the present paper proposes a new methodology to estimate the long term fatigue analysis involving long term metocean databases advanced selection methods fowt numerical models and non linear interpolation techniques all of these combined allow us to recreate the long term damage to a mooring system with a low numerical cost the new methodology is applied to different mooring systems in order to select the most appropriate mooring on a fowt located in the bimep test site north of spain considering the influence of all metocean conditions on the floating structure life cycle the reference platform used in this work is the deepcwind semisubmersible platform robertson jonkman wendt goupee dagher this paper is organised as follows in section 2 the new methodology the metocean databases the advanced selection techniques the fowt numerical model the methods to evaluate the fatigue damage and the non linear interpolation techniques are described section 3 describes the case study involving the site and the definition of fowt the selected sea states and the long term results finally a discussion of the obtained results and the main conclusions of this investigation are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 methodology to predict mooring fatigue damage and fowt dynamics the most accurate method to estimate the mooring fatigue response is a dynamic analysis in the time domain api 2008 where all nonlinearities and dynamics are captured the main disadvantage of this method is the excessive computational cost associated with the evaluation of all observed sea states at the target location the proposed methodology attempts to provide a more efficient approach by following a different set of steps as shown in fig 1 the first step is to collect from a metocean database all historical sea states for a time period equal to the fowt lifetime a maximum dissimilarity selection technique is then applied to select the most representative sea state subset from this database fowt dynamics and mooring fatigue are evaluated by means of a numerical model for the full subset of sea states finally the fowt dynamics and mooring fatigue results are rebuilt for the full lifetime using a radial basis function rbf interpolation technique 2 1 site assessment and metocean database long term analysis requires the use of databases including time series of the relevant environmental parameters to assess wind and wave conditions at a given offshore location they are usually built upon metocean reanalysis techniques and provide metocean parameters extended over several decades the metocean database used in this work is based on the reanalysis developed by ihcantabria and bimep in the framework of the trl project metocean analysis of bimep for offshore design 2017 wind data are obtained from the seawind database menendez et al 2014 wind data are modelled with the weather research forecasting model and the advanced research dynamical solver module developed by the national center for atmospheric research skamarock et al 2008 wind speed w and direction β for the 1985 2015 period at 10 m above the sea surface are provided with a resolution of 1 h wind speed at the nacelle height is obtained using the empirical expression for the wind power law jonkman and kilcher 2012 emeis 2013 wave data are taken from the global ocean waves database reguero et al 2012 significant wave height hs wave peak period tp and direction α among other wave parameters for the 1985 2015 period are provided with a 1 h resolution the numerical simulation of the dynamic response of the fowt and its mooring system over several decades using hourly metocean time series would require a huge computational effort as a consequence the number of sea states to be simulated must be reduced by using a reliable selection technique 2 2 maximum dissimilarity selection technique in general the objective of the selection techniques is to reduce the large data amounts provided by metocean databases at given locations into a representative subset maintaining the variability of the original data the maximum dissimilarity algorithm mda camus et al 2011 is used to select this representative subset the samples included in this subset are hourly sea states of dimension 5 defined by w β hs tp and α from a database p including i sea states pii p1 p2 pi a representative data subset o with j sea states ojj o1 o2 oj is selected with j i the selection starts by choosing an initial sea state from the full database p in this case the sea state containing the maximum significant wave height is chosen as the initial sea state the rest of the sea states are iteratively selected calculating the dissimilarity between of the remaining sea states in the database and the sea states added to the subset by choosing those with the largest dissimilarity at each iteration during the application of the algorithm the subset o is composed of r sea states orr o1 o2 or with r j the selection finishes when the number of required sea states j is reached the dissimilarity di is evaluated by means of the euclidean circular norm between the vectors p and o the dissimilarity value is taken according to polinsky polinsky et al 1996 as follows 1 d i m i n i m u m p i i o r 1 m i n i m u m p i i o r r r r 1 r 2 2 3 numerical model description the numerical model used this work was presented and validated in barrera et al 2019a however a brief description is provided next because some differences with respect to the original model have been implemented the numerical model is built by coupling a hydrodynamic an aerodynamic and a mooring model the hydrodynamic component models the behaviour of the fowt in the frequency domain using potential flow theory based on a boundary element method bem which is transformed to the time domain using the relationship proposed by ogilvie 1964 the bem model used is ansys aqwa ansys aqwa 2013 hydrodynamic results are computed together with the aerodynamic and mooring results by means of the cummins equation cummins 1962 a second order ordinary differential equation with a convolution integral applied to solve the radiation problem 2 as follows 2 m a k

stiffness matrix t is time τ is the integration variable of the convolution integral and k k and k are the floating platform acceleration velocity and displacement respectively external forces are represented by wave excitation forces f e wind forces f w and mooring system forces f m wave excitation forces include both the first and second order difference frequency components expressed in the time domain by the following equations 3 f e 1 j α r e l 1 l a l q j α ω l e i ω l t j 1 2 3 4 5 6 4 f e 2 j α r e l 1 l a l a l q j α ω l ω l 2 l 1 l m l 1 l a l a m q j α ω l ω m e i ω l ω m t where f e 1 is the first order wave excitation force and f e 2 the second order wave excitation force with j representing the degrees of freedom l is the number of wave components a l e i ω l t the complex wave component a l the complex wave amplitude ω l the wave frequency and i represents the imaginary number q j α ω l stands for the first order complex excitation transfer function associated with ω l j and α a l can be written as a l a l e i ε l where a l is the wave amplitude ε l is the wave phase and q j α ω l q l α ω l e i φ l j α where q l α is the amplitude of the first order force per wave amplitude unit and φ l j α is its phase the symbol denotes the complex conjugate q j α ω l ω m represents the quadratic transfer function qtf associated with the frequency difference between pairs of wave components the mooring system is simulated using a dynamic model that allows the estimation of mooring loads with higher accuracy than a quasi static model barrera et al 2019a robertson et al 2017 although it is computationally more demanding the dynamic formulation is based on newton s second law 5 and is solved by a finite element method as follows 5 ρ 0 2 r t 2 s t s 1 e r s f 1 e where ρ 0 is the linear weight r is the position vector s is the longitudinal coordinate e is the deformation t s is the tension and f is the sum of external forces acting on the cable external forces f result from the sum of the buoyancy force f h g the normal f d n and tangential f d t components of the drag forces the inertial force f i and the seabed contact force in the normal f s b n and horizontal f s b t directions their formulations are given by the following equations f f h g f d n f d t f i f s b f h g ρ 0 ρ c ρ w 1 e ρ c g f d n 1 2 c d n d ρ w v n v n f d t 1 2 c d t d ρ w v t

density of water c dn and c dt are the normal and tangential drag coefficients respectively d is the mooring diameter c i is a hydrodynamic mass coefficient v and a are the velocity and acceleration denoted by the subscripts n and t which are the decompositions into the normal and tangential directions respectively z b o t is the vertical coordinate of the seabed and r z is the vertical projection of the position vector and r z its velocity constants k g and k b represent the stiffness and viscous coefficients respectively in the horizontal term k μ is the coefficient of kinetic friction corresponding to a maximum velocity v μ and r x y represents the velocity of the horizontal projection of the position vector the main difference with respect to the numerical model used in barrera et al 2019a is the aerodynamic model normally aerodynamic forces are estimated through blade element momentum theory bemt hansen 2015 however fatigue analysis requires a huge number of simulations to characterise properly the mooring damage a simplification of the aerodynamic model is implemented here in order to reduce the computational cost but retaining a sufficient level of accuracy in the estimation of wind forces evidenced by the validations shown in section 3 4 the aerodynamic model calculates the thrust force by means of a thrust coefficient defined for different relative wind speeds seen by the rotor martini et al 2016 karimirad and moan 2012 it is assumed that only the normal component of the rotor is generating a force and that the nacelle is always aligned with the wind direction the thrust and thrust coefficients are obtained from simulations made with fast jonkman and buhl 2005 considering a rigid tower and constant and turbulent winds defined across the rotor following the well known power law with the exponent equal to 0 14 ten iterations per wind speed are simulated in the turbulent cases and the mean values of thrust and the thrust coefficient are adopted fig 2 shows the thrust force for different wind speeds considering constant static thrust and turbulent dynamic thrust wind comparing both approximations it should be noted that an important discrepancy in the thrust estimation is found between 9 5 m s and 12 5 m s that is higher for constant speeds no substantial discrepancies appear outside this range of simulated speeds the differences are mainly related to the thrust variability resulting in turbulent wind simulations which reaches the rated thrust value only when the incoming wind speed approaches the rated wind speed or in case sharp gusts occur provided that wind fluctuations prevent the development of the aerodynamic loads generated under static conditions the thrust coefficient law calculated for turbulent wind will be used the thrust curves have been calculated using a conventional pitch controller these curves have a negative slope for wind speed above the rated value and may introduce negative damping at the pitch natural frequency larsen and hanson 2007 a filter is implemented to remove the contribution of the pitch natural frequency band from the calculated relative wind speed to avoid this effect before evaluating the thrust force martini et al 2016 karimirad and moan 2012 a smooth transition of the trust curve is added from the thrust curve value at 25 m s to 0 at 26 m s avoiding unrealistic thrust jumps when the wind speed fluctuates around 25 m s the relative wind speed seen by the rotor and the thrust force can be formulated following 7 v r o t o r v v s w l w s w l r s w l r o t o r where v r o t o r is the relative wind speed seen by the rotor v is the undisturbed wind speed v s w l is the platform velocity at the sea water level w s w l is the platform angular velocity and r s w l r o t o r is the position vector between the sea water level and the rotor axis at the tower centreline also 8 t r o t o r 1 2 a r o t o r ρ a c t v r o t o r 2 where t r o t o r is the thrust force a r o t o r is the rotor area ρ a is the air density and c t is the thrust coefficient 2 4 dynamics and fatigue evaluation the main objective of this work is to evaluate the mooring fatigue damage considering different mooring properties fatigue analysis requires the determination of the tension of each mooring line for every sea state the tension at the fairlead is mainly induced by the platform translational movements surge sway and heave barrera et al 2019b and therefore their assessment has an important impact on the fatigue evaluation for this reason floating platform rotations are not a primary focus of investigation in this work additionally the nacelle acceleration is analysed as a potential parameter that influences the wind turbine production as it is assumed that excessive tower top accelerations would trigger the turbine shut down different theories can be considered to estimate the fatigue damage fatemi and yang 1998 however two approaches have been established as the most trustworthy the crack growth approach and the s n approach the crack growth approach is based on fracture mechanics and assumes that the strength of a component fails when an initial crack grows to a critical crack size in spite of the fact that this method considers the load sequence in the crack growth different previous works have evidenced that most mooring chain fatigue lifetime is spent on crack initiation pérez mora et al 2015 therefore it seems appropriate to adopt a fatigue criterion based on crack initiation the present work evaluates the cumulative fatigue damage through s n and t n approaches the s n approach assumes that fatigue failure occurs when a number of cycles n is reached n is a function of the constant cyclic stress range s applied to the specimen this approach provides different s n curves according to the type of material these curves are modelled from a linear regression of normalised experimental test results the number of fatigue cycles n for a particular range of constant cyclic stress s is formulated in 9 as follows 9 n a s m log n log a m log s where a is the intercept parameter of the s n curve and m is the slope of the s n curve it should be noted that there is no endurance limit in mooring s n curves the fatigue damage accumulation during the mooring life cycle is evaluated according to palmgren miner s rule palmgrem 1924 miner 1945 this rule assumes linear accumulation damage without considering the load sequence in the life cycle the parameters a and m table 1 for a chain mooring with the corrosive influence of seawater are found in dnvgl os e301 dnvgl os e301 2018 this standard provides the parameters as a function of a stud chain or studless chain regardless of the steel grade recent studies have revealed the importance of the steel grade on the s n curve estimation arredondo et al 2016 and the possible conservative results of the curve proposed by the standard it should be noted that the measured nominal tension t n on moorings must be transformed to a nominal stress σ n considering the chain nominal cross sectional a c as the representative area 10 the cross sectional area to be considered is twice the chain link d c denotes the link diameter area as follows 10 σ n m p a t n n a c m m 2 a c π d c 2 2 another standard widely used in the mooring fatigue design is api rp 2sk api 2008 this standard proposes the use of a t n curve similar to s n but considering the tension range and not the stress range the t n curves define the number of cycles to failure n when mooring is repeatedly cycled by means of a given effective tension range 11 the effective tension range is defined as a relation between the tension range t and the reference breaking strength rbs the parameters a and m for a chain mooring considering a t n curve are collected in table 2 11 n a t r b s m the reference breaking strength is usually provided by mooring manufacturers vicinay cadenas brochure 2018 an r4s studless chain mooring is considered for the purpose of this work the r4s mechanical properties are shown in table 3 frequency domain or time domain approaches can be considered to predict the fatigue damage due to low frequency and wave frequency tensions dnvgl os e301 2018 api 2008 frequency domain methods have been discussed by several researchers a bimodal theoretical models for predicting fatigue damage under stationary and non stationary gaussian processes was presented by jiao and moan 1990 later the previous theoretical models to estimate fatigue damage were imporved incorporating a trimodal spectral formulation to account for other processes such as vortex induced vibrations viv or wind loads at the low and wave frequencies gao and moan 2008 previous studies have been incorporated into design codes dnvgl os e301 2018 api 2008 the standards admit three possible frequency domain methods to evaluate fatigue damage a simple summation of low frequency and wave frequency fatigue damage independently the combined spectrum of low and wave frequencies and the combined spectrum with a dual narrow banded correction factor despite the considerable computational cost the time domain approach is the most accurate methodology for predicting mooring fatigue response api 2008 because all nonlinearities related to mooring stiffness seabed friction drag and damping are taken into account the s n and t n curves are presented for regular stress tension ranges however the mooring response is irregular due to the randomness of metocean loads hence a conversion of tension stress time histories to effective cycles is required to evaluate the fatigue damage through the s n and t n curves different time domain cycle counting methods are used to obtain the equivalent response between regular and irregular tension series the most popular are the peak counting the range counting the level crossing counting and the rainflow counting methods astm e1049 1985 1985 the rainflow cycle counting method is the most accurate and widely used method to estimate the fatigue damage according to api 2008 dowling 1972 watson and dabell 1975 it was proposed by matsuishi and endo 1968 and a new equivalent definition was performed by rychlik 1987 fatigue damage in this work is determined making use of palmgren miner s rule 12 palmgrem 1924 miner 1945 in connection with the rainflow counting method proposed by rychlik 1987 and implemented by the wafo group 2017 the fatigue damage of a particular sea state is assessed as the sum of the individual tension stress ranges indicated by the rainflow algorithm during the sea state duration finally the total fatigue damage is obtained by adding all the sea states during the life cycle causing the failure if the damage is higher than 1 as follows 12 d a m a g e s e a s t a t e n s k n s k 1 a n s k s k m where n is the number of cycles in the sea state with the stress tension range interval s k n is the number of cycles to failure at the normalised stress tension range s k provided by the appropriate s n or t n curve s k is the succession of stress tension ranges obtained by rainflow counting 2 5 reconstruction of fatigue and dynamics radial basis function interpolation technique once the fatigue damage and dynamics have been evaluated for the selected subset of metocean data according to 2 2 it is possible to interpolate results in the original set of metocean conditions by means of a non linear interpolation technique called radial basis function rbf rippa 1999 this method aims at finding an objective function c through an approximation function c built as a weighted sum of basic symmetric radial functions and a linear polynomial as follows 13 c p c p u p j j 1 j a j j ϕ p o j j where p h is a linear polynomial equal to the multivariate data dimension mv w β hs tp and α a j j are the rbf adjustment coefficients is the basic radial function and o j j are the approximation centres the linear polynomial is defined on a monomial basis u 0 u 1 u m v including a number of monomials of degree 1 and a monomial of degree 0 where b b 0 b 1 b m v are the coefficients of these monomials coefficients a and b are calculated by enforcing the interpolation constraints as follows 14 c o j j c o j j j j 1 j a gaussian expression 15 is used as the radial basis function in this work the shape of the radial basis function is dominated by parameter q0 the optimal q0 can be estimated by rippa 1999 or by means of a sensitivity analysis values of 0 1 and 0 175 are used to estimate the response of fatigue damage and tension respectively 15 ϕ p o j j e p o j j q 0 2 3 case study description and results 3 1 site assessment the location selected for this study is the bimep test site 2 894 43 563 an area offshore the town of armintza on the basque coast north of spain the site water depth ranges between 50 and 90 m the selected period is between 1985 and 2015 therefore a period of 30 years is taken as the floating structure life cycle which results in a total of 271 728 1 h sea states dnv os j101 2014 each sea state contains data of significant

definition the deepcwind semisubmersible platform robertson jonkman wendt goupee dagher with a 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 is considered in this work station keeping is provided by three equal chain mooring lines in catenary configuration separated by angles of 120 with a length of 835 5 m the design weight of each mooring is 125 6 kg m in 200 m water depth despite the water depth at bimep is lower than 200 m it has been chosen to maintain the original configuration of the deepcwind mooring system however five other types of mooring systems ms with a different weight and pretension level are investigated the most important features of these mooring systems are shown in table 4 a schematic side view is presented in fig 4 for the six mooring systems evaluated as shown in fig 5 the deepcwind platform has been oriented with the main wind direction west the coordinate system used in this work is set such that the x axis is directed from west to east and the y axis from south to north 3 3 metocean conditions the maximum dissimilarity selection technique is applied to the 30 year long bimep metocean hourly time series metocean analysis of bimep for offshore design 2017 fig 6 shows the full dataset and the selected subset each database sample contains five variables wind speed wind direction significant wave height wave direction and peak period the number of database samples sea states is 271 728 and they are represented by small black circles in this figure based on a preliminary sensitivity analysis the number of selected samples in the subset is 1 000 which are represented by means of large blue circles in the figure additionally 225 samples represented as red squares are selected to validate the interpolation technique of multivariate data based on the radial basis function rbf approach presented in section 2 5 as a result of this selection a data subset with high variability is chosen including operational and extreme sea states the selected 1 225 sea states are used to generate wind and wave synthetic time series and by means of a wind turbine numerical model to predict the floating structure dynamics finally the rbf is used to transfer all dynamics in terms of movements tensions and fatigue damage to the original database 3 4 wind turbine numerical model validation a complete validation of the numerical model was performed in barrera et al 2019a against laboratory tests published in the context of the oc5 project robertson et al 2017 based on results pertaining to static tension decay tests and regular and irregular waves with and without wind however a new validation of experimental tests of irregular waves with wind is incorporated in this work because the aerodynamic module is now based on a look up table of thrust coefficients and not on the blade element momentum theory bemt used in barrera et al 2019a results are validated for all wind approaches comparing the movements and the tensions at the fairlead of the mooring lines however the focus of this investigation is only on the tension validation it should be noted that the experimental tests were conducted in a single direction with waves and wind oriented from the negative to the positive x axis the rotor torque was not considered in the experiments therefore the mooring line responses are equal in m1 and m3 the results of this new validation for wind and irregular waves are presented in fig 7 through fig 9 considering three approaches the bemt the thrust coefficients for constant wind speed and the thrust coefficients for turbulent wind speed in the coming validation figures these approaches are called the control dashed blue line quasi static dotted red line and quasi dynamic dashed dotted green line respectively in general the agreement between the different numerical approaches and the experimental test results is very good in this work the quasi dynamic approach is selected to estimate wind forces for the reasons explained in section 2 3 see fig 8 3 5 fowt simulation for fatigue analysis the long term fowt analysed variables are platform movements which are the most probable maximum mpm of surge sway and heave moorings which are the mpm of tension and fatigue damage for each mooring line and nacelle acceleration which is the mpm and percentiles 90 95 and 99 a total of 13 variables are considered the mpm is obtained fitting the empirical data of each variable to a theoretical distribution function the input of the validated numerical model are wind and wave time series generated synthetically from the selected 1 000 sea states using the maximum dissimilarity algorithm as explained in section 3 3 the numerical model outputs are the time series of the movements surge sway and heave tensions m1 m2 and m3 and the nacelle acceleration these time series are fitted to a generalised extreme value gev distribution function because the sea states include both operational and extreme cases the mpm of the distribution function is selected next as representative of each time series the correlation coefficients between the empirical and gev distribution for movements tensions and nacelle acceleration are presented in table 5 the correlation coefficients are obtained as the average of the 1 000 sea states for each variable and type of mooring a good correlation is found between the empirical and theoretical data with values between 0 98 and 1 the long term values are obtained through a non linear interpolation technique based on the radial basis function rbf method previously introduced in section 2 5 the non linear interpolation technique requires two development steps first the construction of the interpolation function based on the numerical simulations using the 1 000 sea states selected by the maximum dissimilarity algorithm second the accuracy verification provided by the non linear interpolation this verification is conducted through the selection of 225 additional sea states shown in fig 6 the response to these additional sea states is predicted by means of the non linear interpolation rbf and the numerical simulation comparisons between the responses of the rbf and the simulation are presented in fig 10 through fig 13 for mooring system 3 the graphs represent on the x axis the response given by the rbf and on the y axis the numerical model response simulation if the rbf and simulation responses are coincident they will be represented by a point in the bisector of the graph in contrast if they are not coincident they will be far off the bisector a linear fit line is built with the rbf and the simulation data to analyse its position with respect to the bisector in general rbf presents a good agreement with the simulation due to the proximity between the fit line and the bisector see figs 11 and 12 from the 1 000 simulated cases for each type of mooring 30 years of data are rebuilt using the rbf technique for the 13 variables each variable can be represented as a function of wind characteristics speed and direction or wave characteristics significant height direction and peak period fig 14 shows an example of this reconstruction considering the fatigue damage on m2 of mooring system 3 mooring line m2 is located in the west direction 270 and therefore the damage will be a maximum at that direction as the main direction of wave propagation is at 315 m2 is the mooring line most exposed to wave action the higher the significant wave height the more fatigue accumulated damage in addition according to fig 14 peak periods between 13 s and 21 s generate high fatigue damage as far as the wind is concerned there is a range of directions between 225 and 315 that generate high fatigue damage on m2 unlike waves higher wind speeds do not generate the higher fatigue damage the reason is that the turbine thrust force is maximal at 12 m s according to fig 2 a significant fatigue damage is found starting at wind speed of 10 m s however it should be noted that high wind speeds may be associated with high wave heights and therefore the fatigue damage will be dominated by the significant wave height rather than the wind speed further results will only be shown as a function of wind characteristics due to the important variability of wind direction fig 3 at the target location and the dependence of thrust force on wind speed the influence of the different mooring systems proposed in table 4 on the tension and fatigue damage is displayed in fig 15 through fig 18 platform movements determine the tension at the mooring system thus higher platform movement produces lower tension while a major restriction to the movement induces higher tension in the mooring system a wide range of platform movements can be found depending on the mooring system from movements of up to 14 m in ms 1 with tensions of 500 kn to restricted movements to 2 5 m in ms 6 with tensions of approximately 6 200 kn according to the mooring system configuration a predominant directional sector can be assigned to each mooring line consequently the higher fatigue damages come from the sector between northwest by north nwbn and east e in m1 330 90 between southwest by south swbs and northwest by north in m2 210 330 and between east and southwest by south in m3 90 210 as shown in fig 3 directions coming from nwbn and e are less likely and for this reason m1 will have minor fatigue damage in general fatigue damage decreases with higher mooring weights by comparing the different mooring systems the high fatigue damage achieved in ms 1 92 kg m is remarkable as is how it decreases with the increase in mooring weight until reaching the lowest damage in ms 6 634 kg m in addition it should be noted that although the weight increment reduces the fatigue damage all mooring lines show a high fatigue damage coinciding with the sector between 250 and 330 according to the wind and wave roses this direction corresponds to the extreme events of this location with significant wave heights between 7 m and 10 m and wind speeds between 25 m s and 40 m s the developed method allows capturing the relevance and contribution of directionality to fatigue damage and selection of a suitable mooring system to the prevailing metocean conditions in the target location in consonance with the obtained results the most appropriate mooring system for the proposed fowt and location could be ms 4 because it drastically reduces the fatigue damage found in ms 1 ms 2 and ms 3 no relevant improvement is provided by ms 5 and ms 6 see figs 16 and 17 4 discussion the reported methodology allows estimation of the dynamics and fatigue damage considering all metocean conditions throughout the fowt life cycle in general the standards dnvgl os e301 2018 section 6 3 api 2008 section 6 3 propose the selection of a limited number of long term representative sea states and perhaps this is the reason for the extremely conservative safety factors recommended by these standards in particular the safety factor for the fatigue limit state fls stated in the dnvgl os e301 dnvgl os e301 2018 is 5 for mooring lines which are not regularly inspected in tension tension processes and when the accumulated damage df is lower than 0 8 if df is higher than 0 8 the safety factor is defined by the expression 5 3 df 0 8 0 2 conversely the api api 2008 recommends a value of 3 as safety factor the proposed methodology may lead to a reduction in the safety factors by considering all the climate variability in the target location in addition to the uncertainty associated with the selection of design sea states there are other elements that may affect an accurate fatigue definition such as the design fatigue curve selection the randomness of wind and wave time series the mooring line pretension and the corrosion 4 1 selection of design sea states and fatigue curves in this section the proposed methodology which is based on the estimation of fatigue damage through the simulation of all sea states in the fowt life cycle is compared with the fatigue damage provided by assuming that the long term behaviour can be represented by a limited number of sea states as proposed by standards dnvgl os e301 2018 and api 2008 in general these standards recommend setting a discrete number of sea states between 10 and 50 to select the discrete sea states the metocean database is divided into four ranges of significant wave height 0 1 5 m 1 5 3 m 3 4 5 m and higher than 4 5 m the average wave height of each range is set as the representative height of each subset in turn for each range of significant wave height three ranges of wind speed are set 0 7 m s 7 14 m s and higher than 14 m s for each range wind speed is estimated as the average of the speeds in each range finally four ranges of peak periods are proposed for each speed range 0 6 s 6 9 s 9 12 s and higher than 12 s as with the significant wave height and the wind speed the average is the representative value for each peak period range in all 48 sea states result from this discretisation however a total of 35 cases are set as a consequence of the fact that the metocean database does not contain data in some of the previously set ranges wave and wind directions are obtained as the most likely value corresponding to each range the percentage of occurrence of each sea state is obtained from the presentation probability in the metocean database the selected sea states are presented in table 6 fig 19 shows the distribution of the sea states selected to reproduce the long term environmental conditions and estimate the mooring fatigue damage the fatigue curves used in this work are the t n curve and the s n curve corresponding to studless chains proposed by api api 2008 and dnv dnvgl os e301 2018 respectively the fatigue damage results using both approaches for each of the six mooring systems table 4 with three mooring lines considering the matrix of 35 cases and the life cycle simulation are presented in fig 20 according to the obtained results the following conclusions can be drawn first the s n curve provides estimations of more conservative damages than does the t n the reason for this is that the s n curve provides the same fatigue damage regardless of the grade of the chain steel while the t n curve takes into account the breaking strength of the steel and therefore a higher steel quality generates less fatigue damage different investigations have shown the importance of steel quality on the evaluation of fatigue damage pérez mora et al 2015 arredondo et al 2016 second the fatigue damage obtained using the life cycle method presented in this work is higher than that presented using the discrete sea states proposed by the standards consequently simulating the fowt life cycle can reduce the uncertainty in the selection of sea states and thus can estimate a more accurate fatigue damage table 7 shows the percentage difference between the life cycle method and the discrete sea states matrix according to both the s n and t n curves mean differences between 13 and 49 are obtained in the fatigue damage estimation between both approaches finally ms 1 and ms 2 present an important fatigue damage in both mooring systems m2 is the mooring line that suffers the most fatigue damage the reason is because these mooring systems have large ranges of movement and therefore large stress tension ranges in contrast m2 and m3 are the mooring lines with the most important damage in ms 3 ms 4 ms 5 and ms 6 due to the presence of wind in the region between east and west according to fig 3 these results show that the mooring line characteristics can influence the distribution of fatigue damage for all lines included in the mooring system 4 2 influence of the randomness of waves and wind time series on fatigue damage evaluation the most accurate method to estimate fatigue damage is by means of a time domain method api 2008 however this method introduces a statistical uncertainty into the results due to the randomness of waves and wind the generation of wind and wave time series by wind and wave spectra uses random phases for transforming spectra into the time domain therefore multiple time series meet the criteria characterising in the spectra this fact causes an uncertainty in the estimation of fatigue damage due to the presence of random phases to highlight the importance of random phases in the fatigue damage assessment twenty wave and wind time series are generated for the same sea state ms 2 and the sea state defined by hs 3 35 m tp 9 21 s α 316 09 w 12 10 m s β 328 09 are considered in these simulations fig 21 shows the total lifetime of each mooring line if the previous sea state is repeated cyclically as seen lines m1 and m2 are those most exposed to this sea state and therefore they have a shorter lifetime until failure it is noteworthy to highlight that with the same sea state there are lifetime differences of up to 4 16 and 3 42 years with average values of 6 81 and 8 09 years considering the mooring lines m1 and m2 respectively these results show the importance of randomness on the estimation of fatigue damage 4 3 effect of corrosion on fatigue life another important process in mooring fatigue life is corrosion a steel chain permanently in contact with sea water suffers degradation of its physical and mechanical characteristics the standards assess this process as a section loss dnvgl os e301 2018 the section loss ratio depends on the type of water polar temperate or tropical the type of inspection and the part of the mooring involved bottom catenary splash zone to assess the impact of corrosion on fatigue damage a fatigue analysis over m1 is performed considering ms 2 a corrosion rate of 0 2 mm year and the sea state proposed in 4 2 fatigue damage evolution for m1 is presented in fig 22 fatigue damage is calculated for the initial state and every five elapsed years according to the obtained results the importance of considering corrosion in the fatigue design is relevant because damage may double the initial values at the end of the lifetime of the structure 4 4 influence of mooring line pretension on fatigue and power production the fatigue curves proposed by the standards do not consider the mean stress effect when the fatigue cycle number is estimated for a particular stress range goodman gerber or soderberg corrections are commonly used to take into account the mean stress effect on the material fatigue behaviour rodríguez et al 2005 bannantine et al 1990 these corrections relate the stress amplitude δσ for a mean stress σm with the stress that would provide the same fatigue life with a mean stress equal to zero δσ0 by means of the following expression 16 δ σ δ σ 0 1 σ m σ r n where n 1 for the goodman and soderberg corrections n 2 for the gerber correction σr is the yield strength for the soderberg correction and σr is the ultimate strength for the goodman and gerber corrections mean stress correction factors through the use of the ratio δ σ δ σ 0 are presented in table 8 two configurations are considered the fowt static position and a second one considering a sea state ms 2 and the sea state proposed in 4 2 are chosen to estimate the correction factors the steel quality is set to be r4s with an ultimate strength of 960 mpa and a yield strength of 700 mpa vicinay cadenas brochure 2018 the results show that the mean stress reduces fatigue life the soderberg correction is the most conservative while the gerber correction presents values close to 1 however the results clearly show the importance of considering the mean stress in the evaluation of fatigue damage 5 conclusions this paper presents an innovative methodology to assess the fatigue life cycle of fowt moorings considering the time series of metocean conditions during the full lifetime it is shown that the present method reduces the uncertainty related to the discrete selection of representative long term sea states proposed by the standards this approach integrates multivariate metocean data selection techniques fowt numerical models fatigue modelling methods and non linear interpolation techniques from a 30 year metocean reanalysis hourly dataset a subset of 1 000 sea states is selected using a maximum dissimilarity algorithm these sea states are simulated using hydrodynamic aerodynamic and mooring coupled numerical models to obtain the fowt dynamic response and the mooring fatigue damage this numerical model is first validated with experimental tests to demonstrate the model reliability in the prediction of dynamics finally the results are propagated for all the sea states contained in the metocean database a total of 271 728 sea states making use of non linear interpolation techniques based on radial basis functions this non linear interpolation is validated with 225 additional numerical cases for the following variables platform movements surge sway and heave mooring tension fatigue damage and nacelle accelerations a correlation coefficient between 0 96 and 0 99 is obtained for all variables this approach allows the evaluation of the fowt dynamics throughout its life cycle at a reduced computational cost and achieves an accurate and detailed definition of mooring fatigue damage assessment a set of mooring systems with different properties for the same fowt configuration is proposed to estimate the most appropriated mooring against fatigue damage the fatigue damage evaluation is performed by means of a time domain method using palmgren miner s rule in connection with the rainflow counting method making use of the s n curve and t n curve proposed by the standards despite the significant differences between the two fatigue curves both approaches estimate a mooring of a weight approximately 300 kg m is the most suitable the proposed methodology evaluates the fatigue damage taking into account all life cycle sea states and eliminates possible uncertainty or bias due to the discrete selection of sea states proposed by the standards the comparison between both approaches evidences that the discrete selection underestimates the fatigue damage mean percentage differences between 13 and 49 are obtained comparing both approaches using the s n and t n curves however it should be noted that the discrete selection results can change depending on selected sea states here a reasonable selection is applied taking into account that fatigue is a long term process the consideration of all sea states during the fowt life cycle could contribute to a reduction in the fatigue safety factors proposed by standards although with a certain conservatism due to the fatigue process complexity in mooring made up of chains where other phenomena should be contemplated such as the randomness of wave and wind time series anomalous loading modes out of plane bending corrosion mean tension effects or residual stress from chain manufacturing a sensitivity analysis to some key fatigue parameters is also conducted in this work in particular the wave and wind randomness corrosion and mean tension effects are evaluated in this research the wave and wind randomness is analysed for an operational sea state with the turbine working close to the rated wind speed twenty cases are proposed to evaluate the time series statistical uncertainty the lifetime until fatigue failure evidences a difference among all cases of around four years for the mooring lines with the greatest loading corrosion is a complex degradation process of the physical and mechanical properties of moorings fatigue damage could increase up to a factor of two between the initial state and the elapsed life cycle considering a degradation ratio of 0 2 mm year according to the results presented finally mooring pretension is another important source of uncertainty in the evaluation of fatigue damage its effect can be evaluated by means of different formulations proposed in the fatigue theory the different approaches show an increase of up to 20 in the stress amplitude used to estimate the fatigue damage acknowledgements the authors acknowledge financial support from the spanish ministry of science innovation and universities to phd candidate

22282,mooring systems are under a cyclic loading process caused by the randomness of metocean conditions which could lead to a fatigue failure of the station keeping system the present paper presents an innovative methodology for the assessment of floating offshore wind turbine mooring system fatigue considering the full lifetime of the structure the method integrates the impact of the life cycle metocean conditions over the dynamic performance of the platform thanks to coupled numerical models selection and non linear data interpolation techniques and commonly accepted fatigue approaches one of the benefits of using this methodology is that there are no uncertainties due to the selection of a reduced set of sea states the methodology is applied to a set of moorings with different properties in the deepcwind platform to evaluate the solution which offers the best compromise between size and fatigue damage results show that the best long term mooring behaviour is achieved with a weight of approximately 300 kg m a comparison is conducted between the fatigue damage obtained through the life cycle method and conventional methods the mean differences observed between the standard and the new method proposed are between 13 and 49 depending on the use of the s n or t n curves keywords fatigue mooring system floating offshore wind turbine non linear interpolation techniques 1 introduction wind industry has experienced a huge growth in recent years motivated by the need for energy sources alternative to fossil fuels in particular offshore wind energy technology evidences important potential in the coming years in fact this trend is being led by the european union with a total installed offshore wind capacity of 15 780 mw in 2017 wind europe 2018a the dominant substructures in offshore wind farms are fixed foundations including monopiles jackets and gravity base foundations wind europe 2018a however new technological advances point to offshore floating wind farms in intermediate and deep waters these new solutions are an opportunity for countries with important wind resources but with narrow continental shelves hywind scotland was the first floating offshore wind farm in the world with a total of five floating spar buoys installed in 2017 after this success and according to european policies floating offshore wind farms could provide between 4 and 5 gw by 2030 wind europe 2018b floating offshore wind turbines fowts in comparison with fixed foundations have a higher level of design complexity despite the system stability is mainly driven by the floating platform characteristics the mooring system plays a critical role in the design of structure motions and natural periods hence station keeping systems based on mooring lines and anchors are crucial to guarantee structure survivability and its components e g power cable under different metocean conditions traditionally a successful mooring design considers several limit states ls dnvgl os e301 2018 as follows ultimate uls accidental als fatigue fls and service sls these limit states contribute to properly ensuring the resistance of the mooring and its service criteria this article is focused on the analysis of fatigue loads fls on the mooring lines of a fowt moorings are under continuous cyclic metocean loads therefore fatigue damage is a potential failure mechanism fatigue damage can be evaluated by means of either an s n or a t n curve these curves relate a constant stress s or tension t range with the maximum number of cycles until component failure n numerous investigations have been conducted since the 1980s to understand the fatigue failure mechanism of offshore mooring chains building on prior research on this topic van helvoirt van helvoirt 1982 described an experimental test campaign related to the static and fatigue strength of stud link chains and connecting links under high load cycles in the marine environment lereim 1985 presented a complete study of chain reliability including experimental and numerical assessments he proposed an s n curve for chain links based on a fatigue crack propagation analysis for a corrosive environment assuming different initial surface crack depths the american petroleum institute api api rp 2fp1 1993 proposed a standard based on a normalised tension range to define the fatigue lifetime for each mooring component different t n curves are defined according to floating offshore structure experiments later det norske veritas dnv dnv os e301 2001 published different design s n curves to estimate the fatigue life these two standards are widely used as references for fatigue design by industry and researchers lassen and syvertsen 1997 xue et al 2018 thies et al 2014 as has been shown early investigations have been focused on building fatigue damage curves to allow a safe mooring design currently the mooring integrity management is a current topic among researchers and engineers issues such as residual stress anomalous loading modes or corrosion are receiving increased awareness by the offshore industry martinez et al 2017 estimated how residual stresses generated during the manufacturing process contribute to the fatigue life of mooring chains depending on the loading mode rampi et al 2015 described a new fatigue mechanism based on a combination of high pretension levels and motions generating out of plane bending fatigue loading and proposed a new s n fatigue curve diagram gabrielsen et al 2018 conducted mooring fatigue tests considering surface roughness corrosion pits and mean loads using chain segments recovered from a floating structure in the north sea their results concluded that the degradation of the chains reduces the fatigue capacity although the fatigue design capacity is still above the s n design curve given by dnvgl os e301 2018 as seen in the previous literature review a complete analysis of the different mechanisms that induce mooring fatigue already has been carried out however there are significantly less investigations of long term fatigue performance evaluation traditionally a set of environmental states is chosen to discretise the long term environmental conditions occurrence matrix dnvgl os e301 2018 api 2008 but this selection may affect the long term fatigue life of mooring chains of fowts the present paper proposes a new methodology to estimate the long term fatigue analysis involving long term metocean databases advanced selection methods fowt numerical models and non linear interpolation techniques all of these combined allow us to recreate the long term damage to a mooring system with a low numerical cost the new methodology is applied to different mooring systems in order to select the most appropriate mooring on a fowt located in the bimep test site north of spain considering the influence of all metocean conditions on the floating structure life cycle the reference platform used in this work is the deepcwind semisubmersible platform robertson jonkman wendt goupee dagher this paper is organised as follows in section 2 the new methodology the metocean databases the advanced selection techniques the fowt numerical model the methods to evaluate the fatigue damage and the non linear interpolation techniques are described section 3 describes the case study involving the site and the definition of fowt the selected sea states and the long term results finally a discussion of the obtained results and the main conclusions of this investigation are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively 2 methodology to predict mooring fatigue damage and fowt dynamics the most accurate method to estimate the mooring fatigue response is a dynamic analysis in the time domain api 2008 where all nonlinearities and dynamics are captured the main disadvantage of this method is the excessive computational cost associated with the evaluation of all observed sea states at the target location the proposed methodology attempts to provide a more efficient approach by following a different set of steps as shown in fig 1 the first step is to collect from a metocean database all historical sea states for a time period equal to the fowt lifetime a maximum dissimilarity selection technique is then applied to select the most representative sea state subset from this database fowt dynamics and mooring fatigue are evaluated by means of a numerical model for the full subset of sea states finally the fowt dynamics and mooring fatigue results are rebuilt for the full lifetime using a radial basis function rbf interpolation technique 2 1 site assessment and metocean database long term analysis requires the use of databases including time series of the relevant environmental parameters to assess wind and wave conditions at a given offshore location they are usually built upon metocean reanalysis techniques and provide metocean parameters extended over several decades the metocean database used in this work is based on the reanalysis developed by ihcantabria and bimep in the framework of the trl project metocean analysis of bimep for offshore design 2017 wind data are obtained from the seawind database menendez et al 2014 wind data are modelled with the weather research forecasting model and the advanced research dynamical solver module developed by the national center for atmospheric research skamarock et al 2008 wind speed w and direction β for the 1985 2015 period at 10 m above the sea surface are provided with a resolution of 1 h wind speed at the nacelle height is obtained using the empirical expression for the wind power law jonkman and kilcher 2012 emeis 2013 wave data are taken from the global ocean waves database reguero et al 2012 significant wave height hs wave peak period tp and direction α among other wave parameters for the 1985 2015 period are provided with a 1 h resolution the numerical simulation of the dynamic response of the fowt and its mooring system over several decades using hourly metocean time series would require a huge computational effort as a consequence the number of sea states to be simulated must be reduced by using a reliable selection technique 2 2 maximum dissimilarity selection technique in general the objective of the selection techniques is to reduce the large data amounts provided by metocean databases at given locations into a representative subset maintaining the variability of the original data the maximum dissimilarity algorithm mda camus et al 2011 is used to select this representative subset the samples included in this subset are hourly sea states of dimension 5 defined by w β hs tp and α from a database p including i sea states pii p1 p2 pi a representative data subset o with j sea states ojj o1 o2 oj is selected with j i the selection starts by choosing an initial sea state from the full database p in this case the sea state containing the maximum significant wave height is chosen as the initial sea state the rest of the sea states are iteratively selected calculating the dissimilarity between of the remaining sea states in the database and the sea states added to the subset by choosing those with the largest dissimilarity at each iteration during the application of the algorithm the subset o is composed of r sea states orr o1 o2 or with r j the selection finishes when the number of required sea states j is reached the dissimilarity di is evaluated by means of the euclidean circular norm between the vectors p and o the dissimilarity value is taken according to polinsky polinsky et al 1996 as follows 1 d i m i n i m u m p i i o r 1 m i n i m u m p i i o r r r r 1 r 2 2 3 numerical model description the numerical model used this work was presented and validated in barrera et al 2019a however a brief description is provided next because some differences with respect to the original model have been implemented the numerical model is built by coupling a hydrodynamic an aerodynamic and a mooring model the hydrodynamic component models the behaviour of the fowt in the frequency domain using potential flow theory based on a boundary element method bem which is transformed to the time domain using the relationship proposed by ogilvie 1964 the bem model used is ansys aqwa ansys aqwa 2013 hydrodynamic results are computed together with the aerodynamic and mooring results by means of the cummins equation cummins 1962 a second order ordinary differential equation with a convolution integral applied to solve the radiation problem 2 as follows 2 m a k

wave components the mooring system is simulated using a dynamic model that allows the estimation of mooring loads with higher accuracy than a quasi static model barrera et al 2019a robertson et al 2017 although it is computationally more demanding the dynamic formulation is based on newton s second law 5 and is solved by a finite element method as follows 5 ρ 0 2 r t 2 s t s 1 e r s f 1 e where

barrera et al 2019a is the aerodynamic model normally aerodynamic forces are estimated through blade element momentum theory bemt hansen 2015 however fatigue analysis requires a huge number of simulations to characterise properly the mooring damage a simplification of the aerodynamic model is implemented here in order to reduce the computational cost but retaining a sufficient level of accuracy in the estimation of wind forces evidenced by the validations shown in section 3 4 the aerodynamic model calculates the thrust force by means of a thrust coefficient defined for different relative wind speeds seen by the rotor martini et al 2016 karimirad and moan 2012 it is assumed that only the normal component of the rotor is generating a force and that the nacelle is always aligned with the wind direction the thrust and thrust coefficients are obtained from simulations made with fast jonkman and buhl 2005 considering a rigid tower and constant and turbulent winds defined across the rotor following the well known power law with the exponent equal to 0 14 ten iterations per wind speed are simulated in the turbulent cases and the mean values of thrust and the thrust coefficient are adopted fig 2 shows the thrust force for different wind speeds considering constant static thrust and turbulent dynamic thrust wind comparing both approximations it should be noted that an important discrepancy in the thrust estimation is found between 9 5 m s and 12 5 m s that is higher for constant speeds no substantial discrepancies appear outside this range of simulated speeds the differences are mainly related to the thrust variability resulting in turbulent wind simulations which reaches the rated thrust value only when the incoming wind speed approaches the rated wind speed or in case sharp gusts occur provided that wind fluctuations prevent the development of the aerodynamic loads generated under static conditions the thrust coefficient law calculated for turbulent wind will be used the thrust curves have been calculated using a conventional pitch controller these curves have a negative slope for wind speed above the rated value and may introduce negative damping at the pitch natural frequency larsen and hanson 2007 a filter is implemented to remove the contribution of the pitch natural frequency band from the calculated relative wind speed to avoid this effect before evaluating the thrust force martini et al 2016 karimirad and moan 2012 a smooth transition of the trust curve is added from the thrust curve value at 25 m s to 0 at 26 m s avoiding unrealistic thrust jumps when the wind speed fluctuates around 25 m s the relative wind speed seen by the rotor and the thrust force can be formulated following 7 v r o t o r v v s w l w s w l r s w l r o t o r where v r o t o r is the relative wind speed seen by the rotor v is the undisturbed wind speed v s w l is the platform velocity at the sea water level w s w l is the platform angular velocity and r s w l r o t o r is the position vector between the sea water level and the rotor axis at the tower centreline also 8 t r o t o r 1 2 a r o t o r ρ a c t v r o t o r 2 where t r o t o r is the thrust force a r o t o r is the rotor area ρ a is the air density and c t is the thrust coefficient 2 4 dynamics and fatigue evaluation the main objective of this work is to evaluate the mooring fatigue damage considering different mooring properties fatigue analysis requires the determination of the tension of each mooring line for every sea state the tension at the fairlead is mainly induced by the platform translational movements surge sway and heave barrera et al 2019b and therefore their assessment has an important impact on the fatigue evaluation for this reason floating platform rotations are not a primary focus of investigation in this work additionally the nacelle acceleration is analysed as a potential parameter that influences the wind turbine production as it is assumed that excessive tower top accelerations would trigger the turbine shut down different theories can be considered to estimate the fatigue damage fatemi and yang 1998 however two approaches have been established as the most trustworthy the crack growth approach and the s n approach the crack growth approach is based on fracture mechanics and assumes that the strength of a component fails when an initial crack grows to a critical crack size in spite of the fact that this method considers the load sequence in the crack growth different previous works have evidenced that most mooring chain fatigue lifetime is spent on crack initiation pérez mora et al 2015 therefore it seems appropriate to adopt a fatigue criterion based on crack initiation the present work evaluates the cumulative fatigue damage through s n and t n approaches the s n approach assumes that fatigue failure occurs when a number of cycles n is reached n is a function of the constant cyclic stress range s applied to the specimen this approach provides different s n curves according to the type of material these curves are modelled from a linear regression of normalised experimental test results the number of fatigue cycles n for a particular range of constant cyclic stress s is formulated in 9 as follows 9 n a s m log n log a m log s where a is the intercept parameter of the s n curve and m is the slope of the s n curve it should be noted that there is no endurance limit in mooring s n curves the fatigue damage accumulation during the mooring life cycle is evaluated according to palmgren miner s rule palmgrem 1924 miner 1945 this rule assumes linear accumulation damage without considering the load sequence in the life cycle the parameters a and m table 1 for a chain mooring with the corrosive influence of seawater are found in dnvgl os e301 dnvgl os e301 2018 this standard provides the parameters as a function of a stud chain or studless chain regardless of the steel grade recent studies have revealed the importance of the steel grade on the s n curve estimation arredondo et al 2016 and the possible conservative results of the curve proposed by the standard it should be noted that the measured nominal tension t n on moorings must be transformed to a nominal stress σ n considering the chain nominal cross sectional a c as the representative area 10 the cross sectional area to be considered is twice the chain link d c denotes the link diameter area as follows 10 σ n m p a t n n a c m m 2 a c π d c 2 2 another standard widely used in the mooring fatigue design is api rp 2sk api 2008 this standard proposes the use of a t n curve similar to s n but considering the tension range and not the stress range the t n curves define the number of cycles to failure n when mooring is repeatedly cycled by means of a given effective tension range 11 the effective tension range is defined as a relation between the tension range t and the reference breaking strength rbs the parameters a and m for a chain mooring considering a t n curve are collected in table 2 11 n a t r b s m the reference breaking strength is usually provided by mooring manufacturers vicinay cadenas brochure 2018 an r4s studless chain mooring is considered for the purpose of this work the r4s mechanical properties are shown in table 3 frequency domain or time domain approaches can be considered to predict the fatigue damage due to low frequency and wave frequency tensions dnvgl os e301 2018 api 2008 frequency domain methods have been discussed by several researchers a bimodal theoretical models for predicting fatigue damage under stationary and non stationary gaussian processes was presented by jiao and moan 1990 later the previous theoretical models to estimate fatigue damage were imporved incorporating a trimodal spectral formulation to account for other processes such as vortex induced vibrations viv or wind loads at the low and wave frequencies gao and moan 2008 previous studies have been incorporated into design codes dnvgl os e301 2018 api 2008 the standards admit three possible frequency domain methods to evaluate fatigue damage a simple summation of low frequency and wave frequency fatigue damage independently the combined spectrum of low and wave frequencies and the combined spectrum with a dual narrow banded correction factor despite the considerable computational cost the time domain approach is the most accurate methodology for predicting mooring fatigue response api 2008 because all nonlinearities related to mooring stiffness seabed friction drag and damping are taken into account the s n and t n curves are presented for regular stress tension ranges however the mooring response is irregular due to the randomness of metocean loads hence a conversion of tension stress time histories to effective cycles is required to evaluate the fatigue damage through the s n and t n curves different time domain cycle counting methods are used to obtain the equivalent response between regular and irregular tension series the most popular are the peak counting the range counting the level crossing counting and the rainflow counting methods astm e1049 1985 1985 the rainflow cycle counting method is the most accurate and widely used method to estimate the fatigue damage according to api 2008 dowling 1972 watson and dabell 1975 it was proposed by matsuishi and endo 1968 and a new equivalent definition was performed by rychlik 1987 fatigue damage in this work is determined making use of palmgren miner s rule 12 palmgrem 1924 miner 1945 in connection with the rainflow counting method proposed by rychlik 1987 and implemented by the wafo group 2017 the fatigue damage of a particular sea state is assessed as the sum of the individual tension stress ranges indicated by the rainflow algorithm during the sea state duration finally the total fatigue damage is obtained by adding all the sea states during the life cycle causing the failure if the damage is higher than 1 as follows 12 d a m a g e s e a s t a t e n s k n s k 1 a n s k s k m where n is the number of cycles in the sea state with the stress tension range interval s k n is the number of cycles to failure at the normalised stress tension range s k provided by the appropriate s n or t n curve s k is the succession of stress tension ranges obtained by rainflow counting 2 5 reconstruction of fatigue and dynamics radial basis function interpolation technique once the fatigue damage and dynamics have been evaluated for the selected subset of metocean data according to 2 2 it is possible to interpolate results in the original set of metocean conditions by means of a non linear interpolation technique called radial basis function rbf rippa 1999 this method aims at finding an objective function c through an approximation function c built as a weighted sum of basic symmetric radial functions and a linear polynomial as follows 13 c p c p u p j j 1 j a j j ϕ p o j j where p h is a linear polynomial equal to the multivariate data dimension mv w β hs tp and α a j j are the rbf adjustment coefficients is the basic radial function and o j j are the approximation centres the linear polynomial is defined on a monomial basis u 0 u 1 u m v including a number of monomials of degree 1 and a monomial of degree 0 where b b 0 b 1 b m v are the coefficients of these monomials coefficients a and b are calculated by enforcing the interpolation constraints as follows 14 c o j j c o j j j j 1 j a gaussian expression 15 is used as the radial basis function in this work the shape of the radial basis function is dominated by parameter q0 the optimal q0 can be estimated by rippa 1999 or by means of a sensitivity analysis values of 0 1 and 0 175 are used to estimate the response of fatigue damage and tension respectively 15 ϕ p o j j e p o j j q 0 2 3 case study description and results 3 1 site assessment the location selected for this study is the bimep test site 2 894 43 563 an area offshore the town of armintza on the basque coast north of spain the site water depth ranges between 50 and 90 m the selected period is between 1985 and 2015 therefore a period of 30 years is taken as the floating structure life cycle which results in a total of 271 728 1 h sea states dnv os j101 2014 each sea state contains data of significant wave height wave period wave direction wind speed at 90 m above the sea water level and wind direction wind and wave roses for this location are presented in fig 3 waves mainly come from the north west and wind has three predominant directions east south and west wind and wave directions unless otherwise stated considers the north direction at 0 with positive angles clockwise 3 2 fowt definition the deepcwind semisubmersible platform robertson jonkman wendt goupee dagher with a 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 is considered in this work station keeping is provided by three equal chain mooring lines in catenary configuration separated by angles of 120 with a length of 835 5 m the design weight of each mooring is 125 6 kg m in 200 m water depth despite the water depth at bimep is lower than 200 m it has been chosen to maintain the original configuration of the deepcwind mooring system however five other types of mooring systems ms with a different weight and pretension level are investigated the most important features of these mooring systems are shown in table 4 a schematic side view is presented in fig 4 for the six mooring systems evaluated as shown in fig 5 the deepcwind platform has been oriented with the main wind direction west the coordinate system used in this work is set such that the x axis is directed from west to east and the y axis from south to north 3 3 metocean conditions the maximum dissimilarity selection technique is applied to the 30 year long bimep metocean hourly time series metocean analysis of bimep for offshore design 2017 fig 6 shows the full dataset and the selected subset each database sample contains five variables wind speed wind direction significant wave height wave direction and peak period the number of database samples sea states is 271 728 and they are represented by small black circles in this figure based on a preliminary sensitivity analysis the number of selected samples in the subset is 1 000 which are represented by means of large blue circles in the figure additionally 225 samples represented as red squares are selected to validate the interpolation technique of multivariate data based on the radial basis function rbf approach presented in section 2 5 as a result of this selection a data subset with high variability is chosen including operational and extreme sea states the selected 1 225 sea states are used to generate wind and wave synthetic time series and by means of a wind turbine numerical model to predict the floating structure dynamics finally the rbf is used to transfer all dynamics in terms of movements tensions and fatigue damage to the original database 3 4 wind turbine numerical model validation a complete validation of the numerical model was performed in barrera et al 2019a against laboratory tests published in the context of the oc5 project robertson et al 2017 based on results pertaining to static tension decay tests and regular and irregular waves with and without wind however a new validation of experimental tests of irregular waves with wind is incorporated in this work because the aerodynamic module is now based on a look up table of thrust coefficients and not on the blade element momentum theory bemt used in barrera et al 2019a results are validated for all wind approaches comparing the movements and the tensions at the fairlead of the mooring lines however the focus of this investigation is only on the tension validation it should be noted that the experimental tests were conducted in a single direction with waves and wind oriented from the negative to the positive x axis the rotor torque was not considered in the experiments therefore the mooring line responses are equal in m1 and m3 the results of this new validation for wind and irregular waves are presented in fig 7 through fig 9 considering three approaches the bemt the thrust coefficients for constant wind speed and the thrust coefficients for turbulent wind speed in the coming validation figures these approaches are called the control dashed blue line quasi static dotted red line and quasi dynamic dashed dotted green line respectively in general the agreement between the different numerical approaches and the experimental test results is very good in this work the quasi dynamic approach is selected to estimate wind forces for the reasons explained in section 2 3 see fig 8 3 5 fowt simulation for fatigue analysis the long term fowt analysed variables are platform movements which are the most probable maximum mpm of surge sway and heave moorings which are the mpm of tension and fatigue damage for each mooring line and nacelle acceleration which is the mpm and percentiles 90 95 and 99 a total of 13 variables are considered the mpm is obtained fitting the empirical data of each variable to a theoretical distribution function the input of the validated numerical model are wind and wave time series generated synthetically from the selected 1 000 sea states using the maximum dissimilarity algorithm as explained in section 3 3 the numerical model outputs are the time series of the movements surge sway and heave tensions m1 m2 and m3 and the nacelle acceleration these time series are fitted to a generalised extreme value gev distribution function because the sea states include both operational and extreme cases the mpm of the distribution function is selected next as representative of each time series the correlation coefficients between the empirical and gev distribution for movements tensions and nacelle acceleration are presented in table 5 the correlation coefficients are obtained as the average of the 1 000 sea states for each variable and type of mooring a good correlation is found between the empirical and theoretical data with values between 0 98 and 1 the long term values are obtained through a non linear interpolation technique based on the radial basis function rbf method previously introduced in section 2 5 the non linear interpolation technique requires two development steps first the construction of the interpolation function based on the numerical simulations using the 1 000 sea states selected by the maximum dissimilarity algorithm second the accuracy verification provided by the non linear interpolation this verification is conducted through the selection of 225 additional sea states shown in fig 6 the response to these additional sea states is predicted by means of the non linear interpolation rbf and the numerical simulation comparisons between the responses of the rbf and the simulation are presented in fig 10 through fig 13 for mooring system 3 the graphs represent on the x axis the response given by the rbf and on the y axis the numerical model response simulation if the rbf and simulation responses are coincident they will be represented by a point in the bisector of the graph in contrast if they are not coincident they will be far off the bisector a linear fit line is built with the rbf and the simulation data to analyse its position with respect to the bisector in general rbf presents a good agreement with the simulation due to the proximity between the fit line and the bisector see figs 11 and 12 from the 1 000 simulated cases for each type of mooring 30 years of data are rebuilt using the rbf technique for the 13 variables each variable can be represented as a function of wind characteristics speed and direction or wave characteristics significant height direction and peak period fig 14 shows an example of this reconstruction considering the fatigue damage on m2 of mooring system 3 mooring line m2 is located in the west direction 270 and therefore the damage will be a maximum at that direction as the main direction of wave propagation is at 315 m2 is the mooring line most exposed to wave action the higher the significant wave height the more fatigue accumulated damage in addition according to fig 14 peak periods between 13 s and 21 s generate high fatigue damage as far as the wind is concerned there is a range of directions between 225 and 315 that generate high fatigue damage on m2 unlike waves higher wind speeds do not generate the higher fatigue damage the reason is that the turbine thrust force is maximal at 12 m s according to fig 2 a significant fatigue damage is found starting at wind speed of 10 m s however it should be noted that high wind speeds may be associated with high wave heights and therefore the fatigue damage will be dominated by the significant wave height rather than the wind speed further results will only be shown as a function of wind characteristics due to the important variability of wind direction fig 3 at the target location and the dependence of thrust force on wind speed the influence of the different mooring systems proposed in table 4 on the tension and fatigue damage is displayed in fig 15 through fig 18 platform movements determine the tension at the mooring system thus higher platform movement produces lower tension while a major restriction to the movement induces higher tension in the mooring system a wide range of platform movements can be found depending on the mooring system from movements of up to 14 m in ms 1 with tensions of 500 kn to restricted movements to 2 5 m in ms 6 with tensions of approximately 6 200 kn according to the mooring system configuration a predominant directional sector can be assigned to each mooring line consequently the higher fatigue damages come from the sector between northwest by north nwbn and east e in m1 330 90 between southwest by south swbs and northwest by north in m2 210 330 and between east and southwest by south in m3 90 210 as shown in fig 3 directions coming from nwbn and e are less likely and for this reason m1 will have minor fatigue damage in general fatigue damage decreases with higher mooring weights by comparing the different mooring systems the high fatigue damage achieved in ms 1 92 kg m is remarkable as is how it decreases with the increase in mooring weight until reaching the lowest damage in ms 6 634 kg m in addition it should be noted that although the weight increment reduces the fatigue damage all mooring lines show a high fatigue damage coinciding with the sector between 250 and 330 according to the wind and wave roses this direction corresponds to the extreme events of this location with significant wave heights between 7 m and 10 m and wind speeds between 25 m s and 40 m s the developed method allows capturing the relevance and contribution of directionality to fatigue damage and selection of a suitable mooring system to the prevailing metocean conditions in the target location in consonance with the obtained results the most appropriate mooring system for the proposed fowt and location could be ms 4 because it drastically reduces the fatigue damage found in ms 1 ms 2 and ms 3 no relevant improvement is provided by ms 5 and ms 6 see figs 16 and 17 4 discussion the reported methodology allows estimation of the dynamics and fatigue damage considering all metocean conditions throughout the fowt life cycle in general the standards dnvgl os e301 2018 section 6 3 api 2008 section 6 3 propose the selection of a limited number of long term representative sea states and perhaps this is the reason for the extremely conservative safety factors recommended by these standards in particular the safety factor for the fatigue limit state fls stated in the dnvgl os e301 dnvgl os e301 2018 is 5 for mooring lines which are not regularly inspected in tension tension processes and when the accumulated damage df is lower than 0 8 if df is higher than 0 8 the safety factor is defined by the expression 5 3 df 0 8 0 2 conversely the api api 2008 recommends a value of 3 as safety factor the proposed methodology may lead to a reduction in the safety factors by considering all the climate variability in the target location in addition to the uncertainty associated with the selection of design sea states there are other elements that may affect an accurate fatigue definition such as the design fatigue curve selection the randomness of wind and wave time series the mooring line pretension and the corrosion 4 1 selection of design sea states and fatigue curves in this section the proposed methodology which is based on the estimation of fatigue damage through the simulation of all sea states in the fowt life cycle is compared with the fatigue damage provided by assuming that the long term behaviour can be represented by a limited number of sea states as proposed by standards dnvgl os e301 2018 and api 2008 in general these standards recommend setting a discrete number of sea states between 10 and 50 to select the discrete sea states the metocean database is divided into four ranges of significant wave height 0 1 5 m 1 5 3 m 3 4 5 m and higher than 4 5 m the average wave height of each range is set as the representative height of each subset in turn for each range of significant wave height three ranges of wind speed are set 0 7 m s 7 14 m s and higher than 14 m s for each range wind speed is estimated as the average of the speeds in each range finally four ranges of peak periods are proposed for each speed range 0 6 s 6 9 s 9 12 s and higher than 12 s as with the significant wave height and the wind speed the average is the representative value for each peak period range in all 48 sea states result from this discretisation however a total of 35 cases are set as a consequence of the fact that the metocean database does not contain data in some of the previously set ranges wave and wind directions are obtained as the most likely value corresponding to each range the percentage of occurrence of each sea state is obtained from the presentation probability in the metocean database the selected sea states are presented in table 6 fig 19 shows the distribution of the sea states selected to reproduce the long term environmental conditions and estimate the mooring fatigue damage the fatigue curves used in this work are the t n curve and the s n curve corresponding to studless chains proposed by api api 2008 and dnv dnvgl os e301 2018 respectively the fatigue damage results using both approaches for each of the six mooring systems table 4 with three mooring lines considering the matrix of 35 cases and the life cycle simulation are presented in fig 20 according to the obtained results the following conclusions can be drawn first the s n curve provides estimations of more conservative damages than does the t n the reason for this is that the s n curve provides the same fatigue damage regardless of the grade of the chain steel while the t n curve takes into account the breaking strength of the steel and therefore a higher steel quality generates less fatigue damage different investigations have shown the importance of steel quality on the evaluation of fatigue damage pérez mora et al 2015 arredondo et al 2016 second the fatigue damage obtained using the life cycle method presented in this work is higher than that presented using the discrete sea states proposed by the standards consequently simulating the fowt life cycle can reduce the uncertainty in the selection of sea states and thus can estimate a more accurate fatigue damage table 7 shows the percentage difference between the life cycle method and the discrete sea states matrix according to both the s n and t n curves mean differences between 13 and 49 are obtained in the fatigue damage estimation between both approaches finally ms 1 and ms 2 present an important fatigue damage in both mooring systems m2 is the mooring line that suffers the most fatigue damage the reason is because these mooring systems have large ranges of movement and therefore large stress tension ranges in contrast m2 and m3 are the mooring lines with the most important damage in ms 3 ms 4 ms 5 and ms 6 due to the presence of wind in the region between east and west according to fig 3 these results show that the mooring line characteristics can influence the distribution of fatigue damage for all lines included in the mooring system 4 2 influence of the randomness of waves and wind time series on fatigue damage evaluation the most accurate method to estimate fatigue damage is by means of a time domain method api 2008 however this method introduces a statistical uncertainty into the results due to the randomness of waves and wind the generation of wind and wave time series by wind and wave spectra uses random phases for transforming spectra into the time domain therefore multiple time series meet the criteria characterising in the spectra this fact causes an uncertainty in the estimation of fatigue damage due to the presence of random phases to highlight the importance of random phases in the fatigue damage assessment twenty wave and wind time series are generated for the same sea state ms 2 and the sea state defined by hs 3 35 m tp 9 21 s α 316 09 w 12 10 m s β 328 09 are considered in these simulations fig 21 shows the total lifetime of each mooring line if the previous sea state is repeated cyclically as seen lines m1 and m2 are those most exposed to this sea state and therefore they have a shorter lifetime until failure it is noteworthy to highlight that with the same sea state there are lifetime differences of up to 4 16 and 3 42 years with average values of 6 81 and 8 09 years considering the mooring lines m1 and m2 respectively these results show the importance of randomness on the estimation of fatigue damage 4 3 effect of corrosion on fatigue life another important process in mooring fatigue life is corrosion a steel chain permanently in contact with sea water suffers degradation of its physical and mechanical characteristics the standards assess this process as a section loss dnvgl os e301 2018 the section loss ratio depends on the type of water polar temperate or tropical the type of inspection and the part of the mooring involved bottom catenary splash zone to assess the impact of corrosion on fatigue damage a fatigue analysis over m1 is performed considering ms 2 a corrosion rate of 0 2 mm year and the sea state proposed in 4 2 fatigue damage evolution for m1 is presented in fig 22 fatigue damage is calculated for the initial state and every five elapsed years according to the obtained results the importance of considering corrosion in the fatigue design is relevant because damage may double the initial values at the end of the lifetime of the structure 4 4 influence of mooring line pretension on fatigue and power production the fatigue curves proposed by the standards do not consider the mean stress effect when the fatigue cycle number is estimated for a particular stress range goodman gerber or soderberg corrections are commonly used to take into account the mean stress effect on the material fatigue behaviour rodríguez et al 2005 bannantine et al 1990 these corrections relate the stress amplitude δσ for a mean stress σm with the stress that would provide the same fatigue life with a mean stress equal to zero δσ0 by means of the following expression 16 δ σ δ σ 0 1 σ m σ r n where n 1 for the goodman and soderberg corrections n 2 for the gerber correction σr is the yield strength for the soderberg correction and σr is the ultimate strength for the goodman and gerber corrections mean stress correction factors through the use of the ratio δ σ δ σ 0 are presented in table 8 two configurations are considered the fowt static position and a second one considering a sea state ms 2 and the sea state proposed in 4 2 are chosen to estimate the correction factors the steel quality is set to be r4s with an ultimate strength of 960 mpa and a yield strength of 700 mpa vicinay cadenas brochure 2018 the results show that the mean stress reduces fatigue life the soderberg correction is the most conservative while the gerber correction presents values close to 1 however the results clearly show the importance of considering the mean stress in the evaluation of fatigue damage 5 conclusions this paper presents an innovative methodology to assess the fatigue life cycle of fowt moorings considering the time series of metocean conditions during the full lifetime it is shown that the present method reduces the uncertainty related to the discrete selection of representative long term sea states proposed by the standards this approach integrates multivariate metocean data selection techniques fowt numerical models fatigue modelling methods and non linear interpolation techniques from a 30 year metocean reanalysis hourly dataset a subset of 1 000 sea states is selected using a maximum dissimilarity algorithm these sea states are simulated using hydrodynamic aerodynamic and mooring coupled numerical models to obtain the fowt dynamic response and the mooring fatigue damage this numerical model is first validated with experimental tests to demonstrate the model reliability in the prediction of dynamics finally the results are propagated for all the sea states contained in the metocean database a total of 271 728 sea states making use of non linear interpolation techniques based on radial basis functions this non linear interpolation is validated with 225 additional numerical cases for the following variables platform movements surge sway and heave mooring tension fatigue damage and nacelle accelerations a correlation coefficient between 0 96 and 0 99 is obtained for all variables this approach allows the evaluation of the fowt dynamics throughout its life cycle at a reduced computational cost and achieves an accurate and detailed definition of mooring fatigue damage assessment a set of mooring systems with different properties for the same fowt configuration is proposed to estimate the most appropriated mooring against fatigue damage the fatigue damage evaluation is performed by means of a time domain method using palmgren miner s rule in connection with the rainflow counting method making use of the s n curve and t n curve proposed by the standards despite the significant differences between the two fatigue curves both approaches estimate a mooring of a weight approximately 300 kg m is the most suitable the proposed methodology evaluates the fatigue damage taking into account all life cycle sea states and eliminates possible uncertainty or bias due to the discrete selection of sea states proposed by the standards the comparison between both approaches evidences that the discrete selection underestimates the fatigue damage mean percentage differences between 13 and 49 are obtained comparing both approaches using the s n and t n curves however it should be noted that the discrete selection results can change depending on selected sea states here a reasonable selection is applied taking into account that fatigue is a long term process the consideration of all sea states during the fowt life cycle could contribute to a reduction in the fatigue safety factors proposed by standards although with a certain conservatism due to the fatigue process complexity in mooring made up of chains where other phenomena should be contemplated such as the randomness of wave and wind time series anomalous loading modes out of plane bending corrosion mean tension effects or residual stress from chain manufacturing a sensitivity analysis to some key fatigue parameters is also conducted in this work in particular the wave and wind randomness corrosion and mean tension effects are evaluated in this research the wave and wind randomness is analysed for an operational sea state with the turbine working close to the rated wind speed twenty cases are proposed to evaluate the time series statistical uncertainty the lifetime until fatigue failure evidences a difference among all cases of around four years for the mooring lines with the greatest loading corrosion is a complex degradation process of the physical and mechanical properties of moorings fatigue damage could increase up to a factor of two between the initial state and the elapsed life cycle considering a degradation ratio of 0 2 mm year according to the results presented finally mooring pretension is another important source of uncertainty in the evaluation of fatigue damage its effect can be evaluated by means of different formulations proposed in the fatigue theory the different approaches show an increase of up to 20 in the stress amplitude used to estimate the fatigue damage acknowledgements the authors acknowledge financial support from the spanish ministry of science innovation and universities to phd candidate

particular importance to marine applications according to the literature cole 1948 an undex is characterized by the shock waves and the pressure pulses induced by the oscillation of gas bubbles each of which may lead to severe damage to marine structures the dynamic response of structures in the vicinity of undex is complicated involving detonations of explosives propagations of shock waves pulsations of gas bubbles fluid structure interaction nonlinear vibration of structures and so on in recent years there has been considerable theoretical efforts in evaluating dynamic responses of a structure subjected to undex taylor 1963 was among the first to study the momentum transferred to a freestanding plate from a pressure wave with an exponential profile liu and young 2008 extended taylor s work to analyze the transient response of submerged plates exposed to underwater shock loading however the effect of nonlinear fluid compressibility has been neglected in these works to consider the nonlinear compressibility of water medium a series of achievements has been made by ghoshal and mitra 2012 2016 additionally underwater explosion bubble model is also widely investigated due to the destructive power of secondary wave pulse induced by the undex bubble to structures geers and hunter 2002 developed a model g h model to describe deep undex bubble dynamic and was improved by geers and park 2005 based on g h model the pressure and velocity field from undex in free field can be determined and has been incorporated into commercial finite element software abaqus apart from these theoretical works how structures are damaged in the field of undex has been studied using experimentation for a long time a series of experiments was performed by rajendran and narasimhan 2001a 2001b 2006 to investigate the response of plates subjected to undex hung et al 2009 studied the linear and nonlinear dynamic response of three cylindrical shell structures to undex gauch et al 2018 studied the response and damage of polyurea coated composite cylinders with near field undex through experiments an experimental study was conducted by yang et al 2019a to investigate the damage characteristics of rc slab subjected to underwater contact explosions more recently centrifuges were used to create an inertial force field that obeys the correct scaling laws including price et al 1964 who concluded that centrifuge experiments on small scale structures replicate the conditions on large scale structures snay 1962 pointed out that the effects of the coriolis force induced by the rotation of the centrifuge were negligible on the motion of gas bubbles in an undex experiment song et al 2017 illustrated the similarity criteria of small scaled underwater explosion experiments in a centrifuge apparatus these experiments and analyses suggest that the centrifuge is effective and satisfies scaling laws in recent decades with the rapid development of computer science and technology numerical simulation has become a powerful tool for analyzing structures subjected to undex by adopting the finite element method fem coupled with the doubly asymptotic approximation daa geers 1971 1978 lai 2007 analyzed the transient dynamic response of a submerged sphere shell with an opening subjected to undex using the acoustic structure coupling method zong et al 2013 studied the damage the evolution process and three damage patterns of a whole ship resulting from close in undex shock wang and zhang 2014 utilized the fully coupled euler lagrange solver to illustrate the dynamic response and damage characteristics of concrete gravity dam under the shock loading sph fem coupled method was adopted by koneshwaran et al 2015a 2015b to studied blast response of underground tunnels the same method was used by ming et al 2016 to investigate the damage process of ship structures subjected to undex three stages in the damage process for the plate structure namely localized bulging discing and petaling can be observed also zhao et al 2018 employed sph fem method to analyze and compare the damage features of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions yang et al 2019b used coupled euler lagrange method to investigate the effects of the cross section shape on the response of rc columns by air and underwater explosions however the pressure pulses induced by the pulsation of gas bubbles were not considered in these above works which may lead to underestimate the destructive power of undex to structures to address this issue a numerical investigation of ship structures subject to close in shock wave and following gas bubble pulse was conducted by wang et al 2014 and concluded that if the bubble effects are considered the damage characteristics of ship structures are rather different continuum damage mechanics cdm has become an effective tool for the analysis of damage and failure of concrete structures wu et al 2006 proposed a plastic damage constitutive model for concrete within the framework of cdm a method that has been successful in reproducing the nonlinear response of concrete structures under static loadings the rate dependence of concrete can be accounted for by the dynamic model proposed by ren and li 2013 similarly grassl and jirásek 2006 grassl et al 2013 developed a local constitutive model based on cdm for concrete subjected to multiaxial loadings which provides mesh independent results in the numerical analysis of the failure of concrete structures recently the peridynamic pd method silling 2000 was proposed and widely adopted for prediction of the failure and damage of materials and structures diyaroglu et el 2016 investigated the nonlinear transient deformation and damage behavior of composites under explosive loading using the pd model and concluded that it is a valid approach for the modeling of structural damage and failure under extreme loading most marine structures including piers factory buildings and docks are rc structures however investigations of the damage and failure of rc structures under the combined effect of shock wave loads and bubble pulsations induced by undex are rather lacking the prediction of damage of rc structures subjected to undex is complicated and difficult to assess in addition to the challenging points such as detonations of explosives propagations of shock waves and pulsations of gas bubbles the cracking and damage of rc should also be carefully considered for this scenario a comprehensive study is needed the remainder of this paper is structured as follows to determine the actual loading on the structures a parameter study involving the constants of the equation of state for water and explosive was conducted and the modeling method was validated by the undex experiments of a steel plate in a centrifuge in section 2 in section 3 the numerical model of a rc slab under undex was developed in ls dyna in which the damage and failure of rc slab were modeled and cross validated using both cdm and pd with bond rupture the most relevant conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 parameter study and validation of modeling method the pressure density energy behaviors of water and explosive which are characterized by equations of state play an important role in undex simulations liu et al 2003 this section presents the results of a parameter study used to determine the constants involved in these equations so that the actual loading on the structures can be simulated subsequently a three dimensional computational model of an air backed steel plate under undex was built and the interaction between liquid and solid was modeled by the coupled male multi material arbitrary lagrange euler lagrangian method the modeling method was validated by the comparison between numerical and experimental results 2 1 equations of state for explosive and water the explosives charges can be modeled by the jones wilkins lee jwl equation of state lstc 2016 which calculates the pressure by 1 p a 1 ω r 1 v e r 1 v b 1 ω r 2 v e r 2 v ω e v where p is the pressure v is the relative volume e is the internal energy per initial volume and a b r 1 r 2 and ω are material constants the values of these coefficients for a variety of high explosive materials have been attained by dobratz and crawford 1985 in this study for the rdx explosive charge the coefficients were determined as follows see table 1 the water can be modeled by the gruneisen equation of state lstc 2016 which defines pressure for the compressed materials as 2 p ρ 0 c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 2 μ 1 2 2 γ 0 a μ e and for the expanded materials as 3 p ρ 0 c 2 μ γ 0 a μ e where ρ 0 is the initial density e is the internal energy per initial volume μ is the relative volume c is the intercept of the v s v p curve s 1 s 2 and s 3 are the coefficients of the slope of the v s v p curve γ 0 is the gruneisen gamma a is the first order volume correction a series of these coefficients values is available in the literatures and listed in table 2 the variations of these values are studied in section 2 2 2 2 parametric study and validation to characterize the suitable values of the parameters of the gruneisen equation of state a two dimensional spherically symmetrical model was built as shown in fig 1 the model radius is 40 cm and the explosive radius is 0 53 cm whose weight is 1 023 g the explosive charge and the water were modeled using an eulerian mesh the size was 1 3 of the explosive radius which is accurate enough for the analysis of wave propagation in undex zhang et al 2014 by adopting the values of parameters listed in table 2 a series of numerical tests was performed fig 2 compares the simulated pressure time curves of the shock wave at a standoff distance of 35 cm from the detonation point with the measured test data hu et al 2017 as shown the peak pressure and the wave speed are consistent with the experimental result when the coefficients recommended by webster 2007 were used the most significant difference between webster s model and others model is that a higher initial acoustic velocity is adopted with higher value of c the shock wave propagates faster and attenuate slower in fact since the wave speed is greater than the speed of sound in water near the charge webster 2007 webster s model can correctly capture the pressure density relationship of the fluid in a close proximity undex environment which is considered in our analysis therefore the parameters of the equation of state which webster used for water were adopted in subsequent simulations 2 3 validation of modeling method 2 3 1 experimental setup recently hu et al 2017 conducted a series of experiments utilizing a centrifuge to validate the scaling laws and investigated the dynamic response of an air backed steel plate subjected to undex fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup the size of the container made from aluminum alloy was 1280 mm 700 mm 950 mm which was placed in the centrifuge basket the depth of water was 600 mm an air backed steel plate with the dimensions of 600 mm 50 mm 700 mm was anchored by concrete mortar l denotes the distance from the detonation point to the steel plate to capture the time history of pressure a blast pressure sensor was adopted r represents the distance between the detonation point and the pressure sensor d is the water depth of the explosive charge meanwhile strain gauges and accelerometers were fixed on the downstream side of the steel plate to measure the dynamic responses of the plate the layout of these sensors is shown in fig 4 details of test number ue 04 are listed in table 3 in which the explosive weight w is 1 023 g and the centrifugal acceleration n is 40 g 2 3 2 development of numerical model in ls dyna considering the symmetry of the experimental conditions only half of the model of the container was developed as exhibited in fig 5 the fully coupled male lagrangian method benson 1992 1997 was adopted for the model the explosive charge the air and the water were modeled by the male algorithms the steel plate and the concrete cement were modeled by the lagrangian mesh surface to surface contact was applied between the concrete and the steel plated the explosive was modeled by four of the smallest elements the element size of the water and the air increased gradually from the detonation point to the boundary the dimension of the largest male element was 1 cm the dimension of the lagrangian element for the steel plate or concrete cement was also 1 cm to save the computer time one point integration element was adopted for both lagrangian and ale domain in all simulations and the problem of locking for fully integrated elements can be well preclude lstc 2006 the biggest disadvantage to one point integration is the need to control the hourglassing modes in ls dyna a viscous damping is introduced to resisting undesirable hourglassing lstc 2006 additionally to study the reflection of shock waves the boundary of water was set to the reflecting boundary in the numerical model before detonation the body force of 40 g was applied to all parts of the model to make sure the hydrostatic pressure of the water remained consistent throughout the experiment the termination time of the simulation was 25 ms which fully covered the shock wave and the first bubble pulse the equations of state for explosive and water were the same with that in section 2 2 the polynomial equation of state lstc 2016 was adopted to characterize the behavior of air the pressure is given by 4 p c 0 c 1 μ c 2 μ 2 c 3 μ 3 c 4 c 5 μ c 6 μ 2 e where e is the internal energy per initial volume μ is the relative volume c 1 c 6 are material constants for the ideal gas the values of these coefficients of the equation of state are as follows c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 6 0 and c 4 c 5 0 4 the linear elastic model was adopted for steel and mortar because no apparent damage was observed in the experiment young s modulus of steel is 2 01 105 mpa while young s modulus of concrete mortar is 2 20 104 mpa the poisson s ratio is 0 3 for steel and 0 15 concrete mortar 2 3 3 comparisons between numerical and experimental results fig 6 displays the measured and the calculated time histories of strains of point 3 2 and point 4 2 caused by the combined effect of the shock wave and the first bubble pulse as fig 6 shows following the impact of the shock wave and the first bubble pulse the strains of both points apparently remained within the elastic range of steel although the peak pressure of the first bubble pulse was much less than that of the shock wave the strain caused by the first bubble pulse was close to that in the shock wave phase the reason is that the first bubble pulse actually carried as much impulse as that carried by the shock wave negative strain can be observed during the experiments at 5 18 ms this phenomenon is related to local cavitation which usually occurs in the fluid structure interface when the shock wave impinges on structures and if the structure kick off velocity is higher than the adjacent fluid particle velocity local cavitation takes place in the fluid shin 2004 fig 6 demonstrates that the numerical results are consistent with the experimental results the elastic deformation of the steel plate under undex was correctly simulated on the other hand some differences arose between experimental results and numerical simulations the peak strains in x direction induced by shock wave of numerical simulations were higher than that of experimental results also the numerical results attenuated quicker than the experimental results these may be attributed to the assumed contact conditions between steel plate and concrete in the numerical model the steel plate was embedded in the concrete mortar supports and they behaved in a dynamic interactive way therefore the real contact condition was rather complicated which may not be effectively reflected in the numerical model by using the surface to surface contact conditions the occurrence time of the second peak in numerical simulations was relative earlier than that in experiments which reflected the difference of pulsation period of bubbles similarly the numerical results attenuated quicker than the experimental results in the stage of bubble pulsation additionally except for the strain in the y direction of point 3 2 the absolute values of negative strains within the range of 5 18 ms obtained from the numerical results were smaller than the measured strains to approach the experimental results in this stage the local cavitation effect might be well reproduced in short the modeling method could reproduce the structural response under undex 3 simulation of rc slab under undex in this section the numerical model of rc slab subjected to undex was developed based on the validated method and parameters in section 2 two computational models including continuum damage model and pd model were employed to modeling the damage process of rc slab and the simulation results were compared to determine whether they provide consistent qualitative and quantitative predictions 3 1 development of model to illustrate the nonlinear response and failure process of a rc slab exposed to undex the numerical model was developed as illustrated by fig 7 the explosive charge the water and the air are the same as those in section 2 except for the standoff distance varying from 100 mm to 300 mm as shown in fig 8 a the dimension of the rc slab is 700 mm 50 mm 700 mm the boundary constraints of the rc slab are shown in fig 8 b the bi directional steel reinforcing bars were considered to be d6 mm 40 mm as exhibited in fig 8 c concrete was modeled by solid element and reinforced steel was employed in the beam element also no bond slip between reinforced steel and concrete was assumed the reliability of this assumption has been adopted and verified in references wang et al 2005 zhao et al 2018 3 2 continuum damage model 3 2 1 material models when subjected to explosive loading concrete exhibits complex nonlinear mechanical behaviors and rate dependence which should be characterized properly in the constitutive model in this study the concrete damage plasticity model cdpm proposed by grassl and jirásek 2006 grassl et al 2013 was adopted this model is capable of describing important characteristics of the failure process of concrete subjected to multi axial and rate dependent loading grassl et al 2013 the details about cdpm can be found in the appendix the values of material parameters lstc 2016 adopted in this study are listed in table 4 the reinforced steel was characterized by the cowper symonds material model which defines the strain rate dependent yield stress as follows hernandez et al 2013 5 σ y 1 ε c 1 p σ 0 β e p ε p e f f where ε is the strain rate c and p are the cowper symonds strain rate parameters σ 0 is the initial yield stress β is the strain hardening parameter ε p e f f is the effective plastic strain and e p is the plastic hardening modulus defined as 6 e p e tan e e e tan where e is the elastic modulus and e tan is the tangent modulus the material parameters for the reinforced steel adopted in this study are listed in table 5 additionally it should be note that the effect of temperature is not considered in the above constitutive relations for concrete and steel therefore the effect of temperature on mechanical behavior of materials was ignored in the model but will be investigated in the further study 3 2 2 mesh convergence study for the mesh convergence study three different mesh sizes 0 5 cm 0 75 cm and 1 cm for rc slab were considered the other conditions were same with those described in section 3 1 convergence was investigated in terms of total kinetic energy of the rc slab the evolution of kinetic energy of the rc slab subjected to shock wave with time is presented in fig 9 the change trends of kinetic energy with different mesh sizes was very similar and the rising time of the kinetic energy with three mesh sizes were highly same especially the simulation results from the former two mesh size were quite consistent these show the convergence of the computational model upon mesh refinement in addition further mesh refinement may give more precise result but will increase the computational time therefore the mesh size of 0 5 cm for rc slab was adopted in the subsequent simulations 3 2 3 results and discussion 3 2 3 1 displacement fig 10 shows the time histories of displacement of point a point b and point c fig 8 at a standoff distance of 300 mm respectively in the shock wave phase the maximum displacement was 0 0024 m observed at point a due to damage and plastic deformation caused by the shock wave the displacement of the rc slab did not decrease obviously within the range of 5 18 ms when the first bubble pulse was generated the displacement increased remarkably the maximum displacement increment was 0 0046 m observed at point a which was much larger than the displacement induced by the shock wave by changing the standoff distance into 100 mm the trends of the time histories were similar while the magnitudes increased significantly as shown in fig 11 the displacement of the rc slab decreased relatively within the range of 5 18 ms which was different from that at the standoff distance also the occurrence time of the second peak was later than that when the standoff distance was 300 mm these difference may result from the dynamic interactions between the rc slab and the gas bubble and the change of motion 3 2 3 2 damage evolution and crack patterns the damage evolution of the downstream surface of the rc slab under undex at a standoff distance of 300 mm is shown in fig 12 because of the spherical wave generated by the explosion the damage was initially observed to occur near the detonation point with the propagation of the shock wave many vertical cracks were observed e g t 3 0 ms subsequently the damage was no longer obviously developing until the first bubble pulse is generated under the first bubble pulse which carries nearly as much impulse as that carried by the shock wave more severe damage will develop the cracks continued to propagate and were interconnected as shown in fig 11 d the results indicated that the dynamic response and failure of structures should be investigated under the combination of the shock wave and the first bubble pulse otherwise the structural destruction induced by undex may be underestimated fig 13 presents the damage evolution of the rc slab subjected to undex at a standoff distance of 100 mm compared with fig 12 when the standoff distance was reduced to 100 mm the localized damage was much more severe under the shock wave the ron near the detonation point was damaged seriously with the propagation and reflection of shock wave the radial cracks induced by the severe localized damage were clearly observed as shown in fig 13 c under the pressure pulse induced by the pulsation of bubble the radial cracks were interconnected and widened to investigate the influence of standoff distance on the failure pattern of rc slab more conditions with different standoff distance were simulated and the results are presented in fig 14 as shown although the spherical wave was generated by explosions the rc slab exhibited a structural bending failure pattern as the vertical parallel cracks appeared at a larger standoff distance with the standoff distance decreasing the evolution of damage exhibited distinct differences and severe localized damage and induced radical cracks were observed 3 3 pd model 3 3 1 the bond based pd model classic continuum mechanics is formulated in terms of partial differential equations with spatial derivatives however these equations are not valid at discontinuities and the classical theory breaks down as spatial discontinuities such as cracks develop to solve the problem the bond based peridynamic theory replaces partial differential equations with integral equations that remain valid regardless of any fractures or discontinuities that emerge in a structure due to loading silling 2000 this has been considered an effective numerical method for predicting the dynamic failure process of materials and structures it can be especially effective with complex fractures such as intersecting and branching cracks which appear when concrete structures are subjected to blast loads in the present work the same numerical model was used to study the damage of the rc slab by undex in this subsection except the concrete was characterized by the bond based pd model and a perfect bond between reinforced steel and concrete was also assumed in pd theory ren et al 2017 considering a body which occupies the domain r as shown in fig 15 the equation of motion for any point x at time t is 7 ρ x u t h f u x t u x t x x d v x b x t where ρ x is the density of body u x t is the displacement vector and h normally known as the peridynamic horizon is defined as h h x δ x x x δ b x t is the body force density and f u x t u x t x x is the pairwise bond force density which can be conveniently expressed as f η ξ when η u x t u x t and ξ x x from eq 10 one conclusion can be attained that the pairwise bond force density amounts to the constitutive relation which characterizes the deformation of body and its material properties in the bond based pd model the material can be considered as microelastic brittle as shown in fig 16 therefore the bond force is calculated as 8 f η ξ c s ξ ξ where c is a constant called the micromodulus which is related to the elasticity modulus of the body and s is the bond stretch ratio defined by 9 s ξ η ξ ξ for the brittle materials when the bond stretch ratio is equal to the critical bond stretch s c a bond will be broken and the critical stretch is related to classic fracture mechanics quantity the critical energy release rate g c the relation is given as 10 g c π c s c 2 δ 5 10 the damage indicator of a point in the pd model can be defined as 11 d x 1 h φ ξ d v x h d v x where 12 φ ξ 1 for s ξ s c 0 otherwise two material parameters including the elasticity modulus and critical energy release rate should be defined for bond based pd model in the present study the values of them for concrete are 25 5 gpa and 20 j m2 respectively 4 results and discussions fig 17 and fig 18 illustrate the time histories of relative velocity velocity divided by the maximum velocity in each phases of point b and point c at different standoff distances as shown by figs 17 and 18 the results show good agreement between those obtained by the finite element fe model with the local damage model and pd model the trends and magnitudes of velocity in two phases including shock wave phase and first bubble pulse phase based on the pd model were both close to those obtained by fe model varying the detonation distance two failure modes were also observed using the bond based pd model fig 19 shows the failure modes of the rc slab under the combined effect of the shock wave and the first bubble pulse generally speaking the failure patterns of the rc slab adopting pd model were similar with those modeled by fem with cdpm therefore it can be concluded that the numerical results offer promise for assessing the damage experienced by rc slabs that are subjected to undex 5 conclusions in this work the comprehensive numerical simulation for predicting dynamic response of air backed plates subjected to undex in centrifuge was conducted based on the numerical results the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the pressure density energy behavior of water which is characterized by the equation of state has essential influences on the peak pressure of the shock wave and the wave speed the values of the parameters of the gruneisen equation of state recommended by webster were verified to be suitable to describe the shock wave characteristics in a close proximity undex environment 2 to incorporate complete physical process of undex and resulting structure response within a model the fully coupled male lagrangian method was adopted the numerical method was verified against the undex experiments of a steel plate in a centrifuge the good agreement between numerical simulations and experimental results confirmed that the modeling method can be adopted in the succeeding computational investigations 3 dynamic response of rc slab under the combined effect of shock wave loads and bubble pulsations induced by undex was studied in this paper two different failure modes of rc slab were obtained with the decrease of standoff distance the failure mode of slab will change from the structural bending failure to the localized failure in addition the pressure pulse generated by bubble pulsation can cause significant deformation and damage rc slab more severely 4 two computational models including continuum damage model and pd model were employed to modeling the nonlinear mechanical behavior and damage of concrete the results of the two methods were consistent with each other and enhanced the reliability of the proposed numerical results of damage and failure of an rc slab by undex certainly some experiments should be performed in the future to verify the numerical results acknowledgments financial supports from the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

for valuable suggestions and kind help appendix damage plasticity model for concrete cdpm in cdpm grassl and jirásek 2006 grassl et al 2013 the stress strain relation can be defined as a 1 σ 1 d σ 1 d σ where σ are the positive and negative parts of the effective stress tensor σ which are determined based on the plasticity model respectively d are two scalar damage parameters which describe the softening and the degradation of the mechanical property of concrete cdpm can be divided into two parts 1 plasticity and 2 damage the plasticity part of the model is formulated in a 3d framework with a pressure sensitive yield surface flow rule and hardening rule in the effective stress space the yield function is described in terms of cylindrical coordinates in the principal effective stress space and can be expressed as a 2 f σ κ p f σ v ρ θ q h 1 q h 2 where σ v is the volumetric effective stress ρ is the norm of the deviatoric effective stress θ is the lode angle q h 1 and q h 2 are the function of the hardening variable κ p which controls the evolution of the expanding yield surface the evolution of the hardening variable is given by a 3 κ p h σ ε p in cdpm to characterize the volumetric expansion under compression the non associated plastic flow rule is adopted as shown in eq a 1 a 4 ε p λ g p σ σ κ p where ε p is the rate of the plastic strain λ is the plastic flow parameter g p σ κ p is the plastic potential function to consider the post peak strain softening behavior of concrete the damage part of the model is built analogous to the classical plasticity which is described by the combination of the damage criteria the loading unloading conditions and the evolution laws for the damage variables the main functions are a 5 g σ κ 1 α g σ κ g 0 κ 0 κ g 0 d h κ κ 1 κ 2 where g is the damage criteria κ are the current damage thresholds h is the evolution function for damage variables κ 1 κ 2 are damage history variables α 1 are the rate factors which are introduced to consider the strain rate effect of concrete the greater the rate factors the great is the delay of the onset of the damage and they are determined by empirical relations of dynamic increase factors for compressive strength and tensile strength respectively for tensile loading the amount of dissipated energy may be strongly mesh dependent when constitutive laws with strain softening are used to overcome this mesh dependency the softening modulus is adjusted with respect to the element size in cdpm however the evolution law for compressive damage is kept to be independent of the element size as compressive failure is often accompanied by mesh independent zones of localized displacements grassl et al 2013 
22283,while the dynamic response of a variety of structures subjected to underwater explosion undex has been studied for decades investigations of the damage and failure of reinforced concrete rc structures are lacking here we present the results of a comprehensive computational study of the dynamic response of air backed rc slabs exposed to undex to determine the loading produced by the explosion a model involving parameters associated with the equations of state for water and explosive was validated by comparing its predictions with undex experiments on a steel plate conducted in a centrifuge this loading was then used to predict the response of an air backed rc slab under undex damage and failure of the rc slab were simulated using both continuum damage mechanics and peridynamics the results of the two methods were consistent with each other and offer promise for assessing the damage experienced by rc slabs that are subjected to undex keywords underwater explosions rc slab failure process coupled male lagrangian method peridynamic model 1 introduction the prediction of damage and failure of structures subjected to underwater explosions undex is of particular importance to marine applications according to the literature cole 1948 an undex is characterized by the shock waves and the pressure pulses induced by the oscillation of gas bubbles each of which may lead to severe damage to marine structures the dynamic response of structures in the vicinity of undex is complicated involving detonations of explosives propagations of shock waves pulsations of gas bubbles fluid structure interaction nonlinear vibration of structures and so on in recent years there has been considerable theoretical efforts in evaluating dynamic responses of a

due to the destructive power of secondary wave pulse induced by the undex bubble to structures geers and hunter 2002 developed a model g h model to describe deep undex bubble dynamic and was improved by geers and park 2005 based on g h model the pressure and velocity field from undex in free field can be determined and has been incorporated into commercial finite element software abaqus apart from these theoretical works how structures are damaged in the field of undex has been studied using experimentation for a long time a series of experiments was performed by rajendran and narasimhan 2001a

used coupled euler lagrange method to investigate the effects of the cross section shape on the response of rc columns by air and underwater explosions however the pressure pulses induced by the pulsation of gas bubbles were not considered in these above works which may lead to underestimate the destructive power of undex to structures to address this issue a numerical investigation of ship

structures are rather different continuum damage mechanics cdm has become an effective tool for the analysis of damage and failure of concrete structures wu et al 2006 proposed a plastic damage constitutive model for concrete within the framework of cdm a method that has been successful in reproducing the nonlinear response of concrete structures under static loadings the rate dependence of concrete can be accounted for by the dynamic model proposed by ren and li 2013 similarly grassl and jirásek 2006 grassl et al 2013 developed a local constitutive model based on cdm for concrete subjected to multiaxial loadings which provides mesh independent results in the numerical analysis of the failure of concrete structures recently the peridynamic pd method silling 2000 was proposed and widely adopted for prediction of the failure and damage of materials and structures diyaroglu et el 2016 investigated the nonlinear transient deformation and damage behavior of composites under explosive loading using the pd model and concluded that it is a valid approach for the modeling of structural damage and failure under extreme loading most marine structures including piers factory buildings and docks are rc structures however investigations of the damage and failure of rc structures under the combined effect of shock wave loads and bubble pulsations induced by undex are rather lacking the prediction of damage of rc structures subjected to undex is complicated and difficult to assess in addition to the challenging points such as detonations of explosives propagations of shock waves and pulsations of gas bubbles the cracking and damage of rc should also be carefully considered for this scenario a comprehensive study is needed the remainder of this paper is structured as follows to determine the actual loading on the structures a parameter study involving the constants of the equation of state for water and explosive was conducted and the modeling method was validated by the undex experiments of a steel plate in a centrifuge in section 2 in section 3 the numerical model of a rc slab under undex was developed in ls dyna in which the damage and failure of rc slab were modeled and cross validated using both cdm and pd with bond rupture the most relevant conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 parameter study and validation of modeling method the pressure density energy behaviors of water and explosive which are characterized by equations of state play an important role in undex simulations liu et al 2003 this section presents the results of a parameter study used to determine the constants involved in these equations so that the actual loading on the structures can be simulated subsequently a three dimensional computational model of an air backed steel plate under undex was built and the interaction between liquid and solid was modeled by the coupled male multi material arbitrary lagrange euler lagrangian method the modeling method was validated by the comparison between numerical and experimental results 2 1 equations of state for explosive and water the explosives charges can be modeled by the jones wilkins lee jwl equation of state lstc 2016 which calculates the pressure by 1 p a 1 ω r 1 v e r 1 v b 1 ω r 2 v e r 2 v ω e v where p is the pressure v is the relative volume e is the internal energy per initial volume and a b r 1 r 2 and ω are material constants the values of these coefficients for a variety of high explosive materials have been attained by dobratz and crawford 1985 in this study for the rdx explosive charge the coefficients were determined as follows see table 1 the water can be modeled by the gruneisen equation of state lstc 2016 which defines pressure for the compressed materials as 2 p ρ 0 c 2 μ 1 1 γ 0 2 μ a 2 μ 2 1 s 1 1 μ s 2 μ 2 μ 1 s 3 μ 2 μ 1 2 2 γ 0 a μ e and for the expanded materials as 3 p ρ 0 c 2 μ γ 0 a μ e where ρ 0 is the initial density e is the internal energy per initial volume μ is the relative volume c is the intercept of the v s v p curve s 1 s 2 and s 3 are the coefficients of the slope of the v s v p curve γ 0 is the gruneisen gamma a is the first order volume correction a series of these coefficients values is available in the literatures and listed in table 2 the variations of these values are studied in section 2 2 2 2 parametric study and validation to characterize the suitable values of the parameters of the gruneisen equation of state a two dimensional spherically symmetrical model was built as shown in fig 1 the model radius is 40 cm and the explosive radius is 0 53 cm whose weight is 1 023 g the explosive charge and the water were modeled using an eulerian mesh the size was 1 3 of the explosive radius which is accurate enough for the analysis of wave propagation in undex zhang et al 2014 by adopting the values of parameters listed in table 2 a series of numerical tests was performed fig 2 compares the simulated pressure time curves of the shock wave at a standoff distance of 35 cm from the detonation point with the measured test data hu et al 2017 as shown the peak pressure and the wave speed are consistent with the experimental result when the coefficients recommended by webster 2007 were used the most significant difference between webster s model and others model is that a higher initial acoustic velocity is adopted with higher value of c the shock wave propagates faster and attenuate slower in fact since the wave speed is greater than the speed of sound in water near the charge webster 2007 webster s model can correctly capture the pressure density relationship of the fluid in a close proximity undex environment which is considered in our analysis therefore the parameters of the equation of state which webster used for water were adopted in subsequent simulations 2 3 validation of modeling method 2 3 1 experimental setup recently hu et al 2017 conducted a series of experiments utilizing a centrifuge to validate the scaling laws and investigated the dynamic response of an air backed steel plate subjected to undex fig 3 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup the size of the container made from aluminum alloy was 1280 mm 700 mm 950 mm which was placed in the centrifuge basket the depth of water was 600 mm an air backed steel plate with the dimensions of 600 mm 50 mm 700 mm was anchored by concrete mortar l denotes the distance from the detonation point to the steel plate to capture the time history of pressure a blast pressure sensor was adopted r represents the distance between the detonation point and the pressure sensor d is the water depth of the explosive charge meanwhile strain gauges and accelerometers were fixed on the downstream side of the steel plate to measure the dynamic responses of the plate the layout of these sensors is shown in fig 4 details of test number ue 04 are listed in table 3 in which the explosive weight w is 1 023 g and the centrifugal acceleration n is 40 g 2 3 2 development of numerical model in ls dyna considering the symmetry of the experimental conditions only half of the model of the container was developed as exhibited in fig 5 the fully coupled male lagrangian method benson 1992 1997 was adopted for the model the explosive charge the air and the water were modeled by the male algorithms the steel plate and the concrete cement were modeled by the lagrangian mesh surface to surface contact was applied between the concrete and the steel plated the explosive was modeled by four of the smallest elements the element size of the water and the air increased gradually from the detonation point to the boundary the dimension of the largest male element was 1 cm the dimension of the lagrangian element for the steel plate or concrete cement was also 1 cm to save the computer time one point integration element was adopted for both lagrangian and ale domain in all simulations and the problem of locking for fully integrated elements can be well preclude lstc 2006 the biggest disadvantage to one point integration is the need to control the hourglassing modes in ls dyna a viscous damping is introduced to resisting undesirable hourglassing lstc 2006 additionally to study the reflection of shock waves the boundary of water was set to the reflecting boundary in the numerical model before detonation the body force of 40 g was applied to all parts of the model to make sure the hydrostatic pressure of the water remained consistent throughout the experiment the termination time of the simulation was 25 ms which fully covered the shock wave and the first bubble pulse the equations of state for explosive and water were the same with that in section 2 2 the polynomial equation of state lstc 2016 was adopted to characterize the behavior of air the pressure is given by 4 p c 0 c 1 μ c 2 μ 2 c 3 μ 3 c 4 c 5 μ c 6 μ 2 e where e is the internal energy per initial volume μ is the relative volume c 1 c 6 are material constants for the ideal gas the values of these coefficients of the equation of state are as follows c 0 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 6 0 and c 4 c 5 0 4 the linear elastic model was adopted for steel and mortar because no apparent damage was observed in the experiment young s modulus of steel is 2 01 105 mpa while young s modulus of concrete mortar is 2 20 104 mpa the poisson s ratio is 0 3 for steel and 0 15 concrete mortar 2 3 3 comparisons between numerical and experimental results fig 6 displays the measured and the calculated time histories of strains of point 3 2 and point 4 2 caused by the combined effect of the shock wave and the first bubble pulse as fig 6 shows following the impact of the shock wave and the first bubble pulse the strains of both points apparently remained within the elastic range of steel although the peak pressure of the first bubble pulse was much less than that of the shock wave the strain caused by the first bubble pulse was close to that in the shock wave phase the reason is that the first bubble pulse actually carried as much impulse as that carried by the shock wave negative strain can be observed during the experiments at 5 18 ms this phenomenon is related to local cavitation which usually occurs in the fluid structure interface when the shock wave impinges on structures and if the structure kick off velocity is higher than the adjacent fluid particle velocity local cavitation takes place in the fluid shin 2004 fig 6 demonstrates that the numerical results are consistent with the experimental results the elastic deformation of the steel plate under undex was correctly simulated on the other hand some differences arose between experimental results and numerical simulations the peak strains in x direction induced by shock wave of numerical simulations were higher than that of experimental results also the numerical results attenuated quicker than the experimental results these may be attributed to the assumed contact conditions between steel plate and concrete in the numerical model the steel plate was embedded in the concrete mortar supports and they behaved in a dynamic interactive way therefore the real contact condition was rather complicated which may not be effectively reflected in the numerical model by using the surface to surface contact conditions the occurrence time of the second peak in numerical simulations was relative earlier than that in experiments which reflected the difference of pulsation period of bubbles similarly the numerical results attenuated quicker than the experimental results in the stage of bubble pulsation additionally except for the strain in the y direction of point 3 2 the absolute values of negative strains within the range of 5 18 ms obtained from the numerical results were smaller than the measured strains to approach the experimental results in this stage the local cavitation effect might be well reproduced in short the modeling method could reproduce the structural response under undex 3 simulation of rc slab under undex in this section the numerical model of rc slab subjected to undex was developed based on the validated method and parameters in section 2 two computational models including continuum damage model and pd model were employed to modeling the damage process of rc slab and the simulation results were compared to determine whether they provide consistent qualitative and quantitative predictions 3 1 development of model to illustrate the nonlinear response and failure process of a rc slab exposed to undex the numerical model was developed as illustrated by fig 7 the explosive charge the water and the air are the same as those in section 2 except for the standoff distance varying from 100 mm to 300 mm as shown in fig 8 a the dimension of the rc slab is 700 mm 50 mm 700 mm the boundary constraints of the rc slab are shown in fig 8 b the bi directional steel reinforcing bars were considered to be d6 mm 40 mm as exhibited in fig 8 c concrete was modeled by solid element and reinforced steel was employed in the beam element also no bond slip between reinforced steel and concrete was assumed the reliability of this assumption has been adopted and verified in references wang et al 2005 zhao et al 2018 3 2 continuum damage model 3 2 1 material models when subjected to explosive loading concrete exhibits complex nonlinear mechanical behaviors and rate dependence which should be characterized properly in the constitutive model in this study the concrete damage plasticity model cdpm proposed by grassl and jirásek 2006 grassl et al 2013 was adopted this model is capable of describing important characteristics of the failure process of concrete subjected to multi axial and rate dependent loading grassl et al 2013 the details about cdpm can be found in the appendix the values of material parameters lstc 2016 adopted in this study are listed in table 4 the reinforced steel was characterized by the cowper symonds material model which defines the strain rate dependent yield stress as follows hernandez et al 2013 5 σ y 1 ε c 1 p σ 0 β e p ε p e f f where ε is the strain rate c and p are the cowper symonds strain rate parameters σ 0 is the initial yield stress β is the strain hardening parameter ε p e f f is the effective plastic strain and e p is the plastic hardening modulus defined as 6 e p e tan e e e tan where e is the elastic modulus and e tan is the tangent modulus the material parameters for the reinforced steel adopted in this study are listed in table 5 additionally it should be note that the effect of temperature is not considered in the above constitutive relations for concrete and steel therefore the effect of temperature on mechanical behavior of materials was ignored in the model but will be investigated in the further study 3 2 2 mesh convergence study for the mesh convergence study three different mesh sizes 0 5 cm 0 75 cm and 1 cm for rc slab were considered the other conditions were same with those described in section 3 1 convergence was investigated in terms of total kinetic energy of the rc slab the evolution of kinetic energy of the rc slab subjected to shock wave with time is presented in fig 9 the change trends of kinetic energy with different mesh sizes was very similar and the rising time of the kinetic energy with three mesh sizes were highly same especially the simulation results from the former two mesh size were quite consistent these show the convergence of the computational model upon mesh refinement in addition further mesh refinement may give more precise result but will increase the computational time therefore the mesh size of 0 5 cm for rc slab was adopted in the subsequent simulations 3 2 3 results and discussion 3 2 3 1 displacement fig 10 shows the time histories of displacement of point a point b and point c fig 8 at a standoff distance of 300 mm respectively in the shock wave phase the maximum displacement was 0 0024 m observed at point a due to damage and plastic deformation caused by the shock wave the displacement of the rc slab did not decrease obviously within the range of 5 18 ms when the first bubble pulse was generated the displacement increased remarkably the maximum displacement increment was 0 0046 m observed at point a which was much larger than the displacement induced by the shock wave by changing the standoff distance into 100 mm the trends of the time histories were similar while the magnitudes increased significantly as shown in fig 11 the displacement of the rc slab decreased relatively within the range of 5 18 ms which was different from that at the standoff distance also the occurrence time of the second peak was later than that when the standoff distance was 300 mm these difference may result from the dynamic interactions between the rc slab and the gas bubble and the change of motion 3 2 3 2 damage evolution and crack patterns the damage evolution of the downstream surface of the rc slab under undex at a standoff distance of 300 mm is shown in fig 12 because of the spherical wave generated by the explosion the damage was initially observed to occur near the detonation point with the propagation of the shock wave many vertical cracks were observed e g t 3 0 ms subsequently the damage was no longer obviously developing until the first bubble pulse is generated under the first bubble pulse which carries nearly as much impulse as that carried by the shock wave more severe damage will develop the cracks continued to propagate and were interconnected as shown in fig 11 d the results indicated that the dynamic response and failure of structures should be investigated under the combination of the shock wave and the first bubble pulse otherwise the structural destruction induced by undex may be underestimated fig 13 presents the damage evolution of the rc slab subjected to undex at a standoff distance of 100 mm compared with fig 12 when the standoff distance was reduced to 100 mm the localized damage was much more severe under the shock wave the ron near the detonation point was damaged seriously with the propagation and reflection of shock wave the radial cracks induced by the severe localized damage were clearly observed as shown in fig 13 c under the pressure pulse induced by the pulsation of bubble the radial cracks were interconnected and widened to investigate the influence of standoff distance on the failure pattern of rc slab more conditions with different standoff distance were simulated and the results are presented in fig 14 as shown although the spherical wave was generated by explosions the rc slab exhibited a structural bending failure pattern as the vertical parallel cracks appeared at a larger standoff distance with the standoff distance decreasing the evolution of damage exhibited distinct differences and severe localized damage and induced radical cracks were observed 3 3 pd model 3 3 1 the bond based pd model classic continuum mechanics is formulated in terms of partial differential equations with spatial derivatives however these equations are not valid at discontinuities and the classical theory breaks down as spatial discontinuities such as cracks develop to solve the problem the bond based peridynamic theory replaces partial differential equations with integral equations that remain valid regardless of any fractures or discontinuities that emerge in a structure due to loading silling 2000 this has been considered an effective numerical method for predicting the dynamic failure process of materials and structures it can be especially effective with complex fractures such as intersecting and branching cracks which appear when concrete structures are subjected to blast loads in the present work the same numerical model was used to study the damage of the rc slab by undex in this subsection except the concrete was characterized by the bond based pd model and a perfect bond between reinforced steel and concrete was also assumed in pd theory ren et al 2017 considering a body which occupies the domain r as shown in fig 15 the equation of motion for any point x at time t is 7 ρ x u t h f u x t u x t x x d v x b x t where ρ x is the density of body u x t is the displacement vector and h normally known as the peridynamic horizon is defined as h h x δ x x x δ b x t is the body force density and f u x t u x t x x is the pairwise bond force density which can be conveniently expressed as f η ξ when η u x t u x t and ξ x x from eq 10 one conclusion can be attained that the pairwise bond force density amounts to the constitutive relation which characterizes the deformation of body and its material properties in the bond based pd model the material can be considered as microelastic brittle as shown in fig 16 therefore the bond force is calculated as 8 f η ξ c s ξ ξ where c is a constant called the micromodulus which is related to the elasticity modulus of the body and s is the bond stretch ratio defined by 9 s ξ η ξ ξ for the brittle materials when the bond stretch ratio is equal to the critical bond stretch s c a bond will be broken and the critical stretch is related to classic fracture mechanics quantity the critical energy release rate g c the relation is given as 10 g c π c s c 2 δ 5 10 the damage indicator of a point in the pd model can be defined as 11 d x 1 h φ ξ d v x h d v x where 12 φ ξ 1 for s ξ s c 0 otherwise two material parameters including the elasticity modulus and critical energy release rate should be defined for bond based pd model in the present study the values of them for concrete are 25 5 gpa and 20 j m2 respectively 4 results and discussions fig 17 and fig 18 illustrate the time histories of relative velocity velocity divided by the maximum velocity in each phases of point b and point c at different standoff distances as shown by figs 17 and 18 the results show good agreement between those obtained by the finite element fe model with the local damage model and pd model the trends and magnitudes of velocity in two phases including shock wave phase and first bubble pulse phase based on the pd model were both close to those obtained by fe model varying the detonation distance two failure modes were also observed using the bond based pd model fig 19 shows the failure modes of the rc slab under the combined effect of the shock wave and the first bubble pulse generally speaking the failure patterns of the rc slab adopting pd model were similar with those modeled by fem with cdpm therefore it can be concluded that the numerical results offer promise for assessing the damage experienced by rc slabs that are subjected to undex 5 conclusions in this work the comprehensive numerical simulation for predicting dynamic response of air backed plates subjected to undex in centrifuge was conducted based on the numerical results the conclusions are summarized as follows 1 the pressure density energy behavior of water which is characterized by the equation of state has essential influences on the peak pressure of the shock wave and the wave speed the values of the parameters of the gruneisen equation of state recommended by webster were verified to be suitable to describe the shock wave characteristics in a close proximity undex environment 2 to incorporate complete physical process of undex and resulting structure response within a model the fully coupled male lagrangian method was adopted the numerical method was verified against the undex experiments of a steel plate in a centrifuge the good agreement between numerical simulations and experimental results confirmed that the modeling method can be adopted in the succeeding computational investigations 3 dynamic response of rc slab under the combined effect of shock wave loads and bubble pulsations induced by undex was studied in this paper two different failure modes of rc slab were obtained with the decrease of standoff distance the failure mode of slab will change from the structural bending failure to the localized failure in addition the pressure pulse generated by bubble pulsation can cause significant deformation and damage rc slab more severely 4 two computational models including continuum damage model and pd model were employed to modeling the nonlinear mechanical behavior and damage of concrete the results of the two methods were consistent with each other and enhanced the reliability of the proposed numerical results of damage and failure of an rc slab by undex certainly some experiments should be performed in the future to verify the numerical results acknowledgments financial supports from the national natural science foundation of china grant nos

for valuable suggestions and kind help appendix damage plasticity model for concrete cdpm in cdpm grassl and jirásek 2006 grassl et al 2013 the stress strain relation can be defined as a 1 σ 1 d σ 1 d σ where σ are the positive and negative parts of the effective stress tensor σ which are determined based on the plasticity model respectively d are two scalar damage parameters which describe the softening and the degradation of the mechanical property of concrete cdpm can be divided into two parts 1 plasticity and 2 damage the plasticity part of the model is formulated in a 3d framework with a pressure sensitive yield surface flow rule and hardening rule in the effective stress space the yield function is described in terms of cylindrical coordinates in the principal effective stress space and can be expressed as a 2 f σ κ p f σ v ρ θ q h 1 q h 2 where σ v is the volumetric effective stress ρ is the norm of the deviatoric effective stress θ is the lode angle q h 1 and q h 2 are the function of the hardening variable κ p which controls the evolution of the expanding yield surface the evolution of the hardening variable is given by a 3 κ p h σ ε p in cdpm to characterize the volumetric expansion under compression the non associated plastic flow rule is adopted as shown in eq a 1 a 4 ε p λ g p σ σ κ p where ε p is the rate of the plastic strain λ is the plastic flow parameter g p σ κ p is the plastic potential function to consider the post peak strain softening behavior of concrete the damage part of the model is built analogous to the classical plasticity which is described by the combination of the damage criteria the loading unloading conditions and the evolution laws for the damage variables the main functions are a 5 g σ κ 1 α g σ κ g 0 κ 0 κ g 0 d h κ κ 1 κ 2 where g is the damage criteria κ are the current damage thresholds h is the evolution function for damage variables κ 1 κ 2 are damage history variables α 1 are the rate factors which are introduced to consider the strain rate effect of concrete the greater the rate factors the great is the delay of the onset of the damage and they are determined by empirical relations of dynamic increase factors for compressive strength and tensile strength respectively for tensile loading the amount of dissipated energy may be strongly mesh dependent when constitutive laws with strain softening are used to overcome this mesh dependency the softening modulus is adjusted with respect to the element size in cdpm however the evolution law for compressive damage is kept to be independent of the element size as compressive failure is often accompanied by mesh independent zones of localized displacements grassl et al 2013 
22284,previous studies have shown that the twin plate breakwater has good performance in wave dissipation in particular under deep water conditions the performance of twin plate breakwater is subjected to several parameters and some of these parameters are coupled to the others thus far there was no simple and effective method to calculate the dissipation coefficient of the twin plate breakwater the objective of the present study is to address the mechanism of wave dissipation and apply the developed rn number to evaluate the dissipating performance on the twin plate breakwater the experimental results showed that the transmission reflection and dissipation coefficients were strongly depending on the developed rn number based on various data fitting an optimal empirical equation is obtained to predict the dissipation of the twin plate breakwater through the developed rn number the empirical equation has been verified by the chi square test and hence can be used for bulk estimation for transmission coefficient under normal and oblique waves keywords twin plate breakwater dissipation performance model test rn number 1 introduction as known the cost of conventional impermeable breakwater increases with the water depth exponentially as well as leads to aquatic environment issues the horizontal twin plate breakwater could be an alternative solution to dissipate wave energy efficiently and has less impacts on water quality several factors are affecting the performance of horizontal plate breakwater i e plate width number of layers plate spacing submerged depth opening modes incident wave height period direction wave steepness water depth etc for single horizontal plate breakwater previous studies reported that the relative plate width relative submerged depth and relative wave height have a significant effect on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the horizontal plate however natural sea level is always changing with tides given the fixed submerged depth of a single plate the dissipation performance of the single plate is unsteady therefore studies on twin and multilayer plate breakwaters were then launched for example wang and shen 1999 usha and gayathri 2005 liu et al 2008 2009 lin 2012 and cho et al 2013 performed analytical and numerical calculations for multilayer submerged plates the numerical results revealed that the reflection and transmission coefficient strongly depend on the relative plate width submerged depth of the top plate and relative water depth besides the number of layers could also impact on the reflection and transmission coefficient for horizontal twin plate the reflection and transmission coefficient subject to the relative plate width and relative water depth the best dissipation performance is achieved with a relative water depth of 0 2 0 6 and a plate width of 0 2 0 3 when incident angle θ ranges from 0 to 60 wave length l θ lcosθ with relative water depth kdcosθ 2 there is minor difference in dissipation performance for normal and oblique waves with kdcosθ 2 however the transmission coefficient decreases with the incident angle model tests of horizontal plate breakwaters have been carried out by cheong and patarapanich 1992 neelamani and gayathri 2006 tang 2006 gu 2009 chen 2010 li 2014 liu 2014 and cho et al 2013 cheong and patarapanich 1992 reported that the transmission coefficient is minimum when the top plate is at the free surface and the ratio of the submerged depth of the lower plate to the water depth is about 0 15 0 20 liu et al 2014 examined the transmission and reflection coefficient of a submerged two layer horizontal porous plate breakwater in regular and irregular with four breakwater models they considered the porosity of the upper plate should be smaller than that of the lower plate to obtain the lower transmission coefficient they also suggested that the optimal ratio of plate width to incident wavelength is about 0 25 0 4 compared to the experimental results of liu et al 2014 and analytical solutions of cho 2013 the difference in the transmission coefficients was enlarged significantly when the plate width was wide cho 2013 pointed out that the dissipation performance of submerged two layer porous plate breakwater was enhanced while plate width was large where the energy loss of porosity was magnified there are few studies on horizontal plate breakwater under oblique waves in particular for model tests of dual plate in oblique waves i e liu 2008 and cho 2013 based on potential theory liu 2008 discussed the interaction and proposed a method to estimate the reflection and transmission coefficient by applying eigen function expansion from their analysis results the dissipation performance of a submerged dual plate breakwater can be improved by reducing the plate thickness or increasing the incident angle thus far there was no simple and effective method to calculate the dissipation coefficient of the twin plate breakwater based on model tests the relationship between the dissipation coefficient and the impact factors has been revealed partially however the applicable quantitative calculation for dissipation performance under an oblique wave is not systematic this study investigates the quantitative evaluation for dissipation performance of horizontal twin plate breakwater the upper plate surface was placed at the mean water level 3d model tests have been carried out with various incident angles to examine the feasibility of estimating twin plate dissipation in the following we firstly present the experimental setup and parameters secondly the dissipation mechanism of twin plate breakwater will be addressed based on the measured transmission and reflection coefficients the developed rn number is then defined to evaluate dissipation performance in the end an empirical equation is proposed to estimate the performance of twin plate breakwater through the developed rn number 2 experimental study 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were carried out in a wave basin at state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology the basin is 40 m long 8 m wide and 1 0 m deep a piston type 3d wave maker is installed at one end of the basin to generate designed waves at the other end of the basin an artificial absorbent beach was installed to dissipate wave energy and minimize reflections effectively previous results have indicated that the beach is effective for wave dissipation and less than 5 of the incident wave energy is reflected with a water depth of 0 5 m the wave height can be generated in the range of 0 05 0 167 m the wave heights were measured using resistance wire wave probes placing at specified locations with a sampling interval of 0 02 s the sampling lengths were 2048 and 8192 for regular and random waves respectively as shown in fig 1 the model of the twin plate breakwater made of wood with waterproof coating was located approximately 19 m away from the wave maker θ 0 is the angle between the wave propagation and normal direction of the breakwater θ r the reflection angle before the breakwater θ t the refraction angle after the breakwater the incident wave direction θ 0 can be changed by adjusting the direction of the twin horizontal plate model one set of 5 wave probes were placed before the breakwater region 1 to obtain the reflection coefficient and the other set of 4 probes were placed after the breakwater region 2 to obtain the transmission coefficient both sets of probes were arranged in a t shape since such configuration can obtain sufficient data to calculate the transmission coefficient after the breakwater yu and liu 1992 the distance from the t center to the breakwater was approximately twice the average wavelength in the current experimental study we take into account the normalized parameters of incident wave height h d hs d wave steepness h l hs l water depth d l and incident angle as well as the dimensionless plate width b l in the tests the breakwater dimensions and water depth are plate width b 100 cm plate spacing s 10 cm s d 0 2 and water depth d 50 cm for regular wave cases the wave period t is varied from 0 67s to 1 8s with wave height ranging in h 0 05 0 2 m for irregular waves the improved jonswap spectrum was selected with the peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 goda 2010 the peak period was in a range of 1 0 2 4s with a significant wave height of h s 0 05 0 175 m the wave parameters for normal and oblique incident waves are summarized in tables 1 and 2 respectively 2 2 measurements and data analysis 2 2 1 experimental wave simulation wave gauges were set on the central line of the model cross section the gauges were calibrated before the measurements and original wave height was measured regular waves were generated by inputting the cosine wave signal and the random waves were generated by simulating the target wave spectrum the calibrated waves were measured at the model position and compared to the target spectrum and then correction was repeated several times until matching the target spectrum to simulate the targeted random waves jonswap spectrum with γ 3 3 was used in the experiments 1 s f β j h 1 3 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 5 4 t p f 4 γ exp f f p 1 2 2 σ 2 where t p is the spectrum peak period t p t h 1 3 1

breakwater model the wave parameters were calibrated after calibration the twin plate breakwater model was placed in the wave basin then gauges were set at the front and rear part of the plates for measurements the data were recorded until the wave behind the plate became stable in oblique wave tests the variation of the incident angles was controlled by changing the orientations of the breakwater model the wave generation system was equipped with the active wave absorption control system awacs to reduce reflection besides absorbing materials were placed on sidewalls of the basin as well as on the beach to minimize the wave reflection and radiation the basin has been extensively used in our laboratory for various studies previous results have indicated that the beach is effective for wave dissipation and less than 5 of the incident wave energy is reflected all the tests were repeated at least three times and the averages were taken as the final results the transmission reflection and dissipation coefficient satisfy 3 c t 2 c r 2 c l 2 1 where c t c r and c l are the transmission reflection and dissipation coefficient respectively after passing through the breakwater the wave period after the plates could be different from the incident wave period besides the time history sometimes includes many cross zero fluctuations in high frequency with the same sampling length the wave number after breakwater could be significantly more than the incident wave number which underestimates the statistic wave height after breakwater therefore it is not true to calculate the transmission coefficient by ratio the wave heights before and after the breakwater in the present study the transmission coefficient is obtained by ratio the wave energy before and after the breakwater based on the time histories of the incident and transmitted waves measured by the probes before and after the breakwater the spectra of the incident and transmitted waves were obtained by performing fast fourier transform fft then the 1st order moment of the incident and transmitted wave spectra can be obtained as m 0 and m t respectively the transmission coefficient can then be obtained 4 c t m t m 0 based on the recorded wave elevation before the breakwater the incident and reflected wave spectra can be obtained by using goda s method to separate the incident and reflected components in random waves then the reflection coefficient can be calculated using the same method in calculating the transmission coefficient the dissipation coefficient can be determined through eq 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 discussion on the mechanism of wave dissipation based on the potential theory the water wave energy under the free surface consists of potential energy e p and kinetic energy e k the potential energy e p is subjected to the surface elevation and the water particle velocity yields the kinetic energy e k the periodic average potential and kinematic energy are 5 e p e k 1 4 ρ g a 2 the total energy yields 6 e e p e k 1 2 ρ g a 2 where ρ is water density g the gravitational acceleration and a the wave amplitude as illustrated in fig 2 the flow field in the breakwater area is divided into three zones by the twin plates and the energy in each zone is defined as e 1 e 2 and e 3 respectively with the total energy of e e 1 e 2 e 3 for each zone of the three the energy transfer is different from the others since the motion of the water body is various in each zone in zone i above the upper plate the water depth becomes shallow sharply when waves approach the plate as a consequence the motion of the water particle changes rapidly and the potential energy converts to kinetic energy quickly the drastic energy conversion accompanied by turbulent fluctuation leads to wave dissipation above the upper plate on wave peak the water particle moves forward along the upper plate with energy dissipation in wave trough the water particle moves backward along the upper plate with energy dissipation the surplus energy acted on the reflected waves under the fixed boundary conditions between the twin plates the free surface disappeared and the potential converts to kinematic energy completely with e p2 0 and e 2 e k2 therefore the water particle moves back and forth in zone ii and the kinematic energy with reverse velocity contributes to the reflected wave in zone iii below the lower plate the water body is restricted by the fixed boundaries of the lower plate and seabed similar to zone ii the potential converts to kinematic energy completely in zone iii e p3 0 and e 3 e k3 to address the mechanism of wave dissipation on the twin plate breakwater fig 3 presents the measured transmission and reflection coefficients versus various relative plate widths under regular and random waves the experimental results show that the reflection coefficient keeps in quasi steady with relative plate width b l 0 5 it implies that the relative plate width b l 0 5 could be a turning point and further increase on plate width would not contribute more energy in reflection it can be attributed to that the twin plate boundaries change the circular motion of water particles to back and forth flow as well as convert the potential to kinematic energy when the water particles move backward along the plates the kinematic energy contributes to the reflection on the contrary wave dissipation keeps increasing with the relative plate width under regular and random waves it implies that the width of the plate is a key factor in dissipating the wave energy 3 2 rnn it has been clarified in previous studies that the dissipation performance of twin plate breakwater is subjected to the plate dimensions of width and spacing as well as wave parameters of wave height wave period and water depth i e gu et al 2017 currently a combination of the above factors is applied to evaluate the dissipation performance of a twin plate breakwater through such a combination however it is not simple to clarify the key factor yielding the performance of the breakwater in the present study we will figure out a comprehensive parameter to evaluate the performance of a twin plate breakwater effectively as discussed in the last section the interaction between the twin plates and waves leads to energy conversion from potential to kinetic change of energy flux direction and dissipation the kinetic is subjected to the water particle velocity and the dissipation is subjected to the width of the plate in terms of the interaction of wave and structure it is well known that k c number has been applied to evaluate the wave diffraction around the structure k c number is the ratio of the maximum periodic movement of water particle to the typical dimension of the structure the maximum movement in one period is related to wave parameters of wave height wave period and water depth also the width of the plate is the key factor for wave dissipation therefore it is worth to check out if k c number can describe the dissipation characteristics of horizontal twin plate breakwater refer to k c number reddy and neelamani 1992 investigated the performance of a submerged single plate breakwater by defining the rn number rnn 7 r n n u d 1 t b where d 1 is the depth of the plate u d1 is the horizontal velocity of water particle at the bottom of the plate based on experimental results reddy and neelamani 1992 plotted the curve for transmission coefficient and rn number unfortunately no conclusion has been drawn since the variance of the curve is too large to present typical characteristics of the incident wave we develop the rn number by using the water particle velocity at the mean water level 8 r n n u max t b 8a u max π h cosh k d t sinh k d 1 20 d l 1 2 8b u max π h t d l 1 2 where u max is the maximum horizontal velocity of water particle at mean sea level under regular waves for random waves rn number can be expressed as 9 r n n u s max t b 9a u s max π h s cosh k d t p sinh k d 1 20 d l 1 2 9b u s max π h s t p d l 1 2 where u smax is the maximum horizontal velocity of water particle computed by the significant wave height and peak period in the following the relationship between transmission coefficient c t reflection coefficient c r and dissipation coefficient c l and rn number will be investigated 3 2 1 normal incident waves fig 4 illustrates the variation of measured transmission coefficient c t r l versus rnn in regular and random waves the transmission coefficient c t increases with rnn significantly the reflection coefficient keeps quasi steady when rnn reaches a certain value the dissipation decreases with rn number for further investigation given five relative wave heights the transmission coefficient versus rnn has been plotted in fig 5 under various relative plate width and water depth for each relative wave height the transmission coefficient increased with the rnn nonlinearly with larger rnn however the increment of transmission coefficient versus rnn became weaker alternately given a constant relative wave height of h d 0 2 the variation of transmission coefficient versus rnn is plotted in fig 6 under various relative water depths the measured results illustrated that for each relative water depth the transmission coefficient increased with rnn in a similar pattern given three relative wave heights in random waves the transmission coefficient versus rn number has been plotted in fig 7 under various relative plate width and water depth the transmission coefficient increased with the rn number nonlinearly but the increment became weaker with steeper waves it implies that the variation of transmission versus rn number in random wave is the same as that in regular wave thus far it can be concluded that the rn number is an effective parameter to evaluate the wave dissipation performance of the horizontal twin plate breakwater the above results indicate that the rnn takes effect as a combination of the relative plate width relative water depth and wave height in the same manner the variation of transmission coefficient c t versus rnn is fitting in fig 8 under random wave for each of the three relative wave heights logarithmic function has been fitted and good correlation coefficients in 0 93 0 97 are achieved 3 2 2 effect of oblique angle the results under normal incident waves have proved that rn number rnn is an effective parameter in estimating the dissipation performance of twin plate breakwater rnn reveals transmission coefficient change patterns as relative plate spacing relative wave height and wave steepness to investigate the effect of the oblique angle on the transmission coefficient the variation of c t versus rn number is plotted in figs 9 and 10 under oblique regular and random waves respectively the wave parameters for regular and random waves are h d 0 2 b l 0 33 0 8 and h s d 0 1 h s d 0 2 b l 0 22 0 66 respectively the incident angles of 0 30 and 45 have been considered the results in figs 9 and 10 indicate that for various incident angles in regular and random waves c t increased with the rn number it implies that the variation of transmission coefficient c t versus rn number under oblique wave has the same characteristics to that under normal incident waves to quantify the effect of rnn on c t the measured data were fitted by a quadratic polynomial and logarithmic functions in fig 11 a c e and 14 b d f respectively the correlation coefficient ranged in 0 88 0 97 indicating a strong agreement 3 2 3 wave dissipation mechanism under oblique waves in section 3 1 the mechanism of wave dissipation on horizontal twin plate breakwater has been addressed by analyzing the water particle motion and energy converts under the plates here the reason for the decrease trend of transmission coefficient with the oblique angles will be focused firstly with the increase of relative incident angle the movement of water particle increases to cross the same plates which is equal to lengthen the plate width it agrees well with the experimental results 1 the transmission coefficient decreases with the plate width 2 longer plate width leads to stronger dissipation along the plate secondly refraction may occur as the incident wave passing through the twin plate breakwater obliquely hence the propagation of the transmitted wave could deviate from the incident direction such deviation will disturb the back and forth flow between the twin plates and from the lower plate to seabed as a consequence the energy flux in reverse direction becomes weaker and the reflection coefficient decreases as well as dissipation increases figs 9 and 10 demonstrate that the transmission coefficient generally decreases with the oblique angles under both regular and random waves this could be attributed to the following three points 1 increase of water particle movement cross the plates 2 reflection decreases due to the refraction 3 dissipation increases to verify the summary proposed above the variation of transmission coefficient versus rn number rnn is plotted in fig 12 under various incident angles of 0 30 and 45 the experimental parameters ranged in b l s 0 28 0 66 h s l s 0 02 0 07 as well as constant relative wave height of h s d 0 1 and h s d 0 2 the results in fig 12 illustrated that the transmission coefficient under an oblique wave is generally smaller than that under a normal incident wave which verifies the above explanation somehow this is reinforced by the decrease trend of transmission coefficient versus the oblique angle in fig 9 under regular waves 3 3 calculation and validation of transmission coefficient 3 3 1 transmission coefficient estimation by using rnn h d it is illustrated in fig 8 that various logarithmic curves of c t rnn have been well fitted for various h d for bulk estimation in engineering the relationship between c t and rnn h d or rnn h s d is worth to figure out to simplify the fitting equation where h and hs are wave height and significant wave height in regular and random waves respectively the variation of c t rnn h d or rnn h s d under various relative wave heights in regular and random waves is plotted in figs 13 and 14 respectively based on the measurements in figs 13 and 14 the best fitting curves are achieved in logarithmic function as shown in fig 15 it is revealed that a simple empirical equation can be obtained to estimate the transmission coefficient within a certain range of relative wave height h d for example y 0 22ln x 0 26 for regular wave with h d 0 10 0 35 and y 0 46ln x 0 13 for random wave with h s d 0 10 0 30 rnn h d is the ratio of rnn to the relative wave height and combines the coupled effect of b l h d and h l on transmission coefficient the curve fitting indicates that the variation of transmission coefficient versus rnn h d shows good agreement to the logarithm function assuming a directional coefficient λ ct θ 0 independent to rnn the transmission coefficient for oblique wave can be obtained 11 c t λ ct θ 0 a ln r n n h d b where a and b are constants to be determined by data fittings the constants coefficients in eq 11 can be determined through curve fitting on the measured data for example the directional coefficient under oblique irregular waves can be obtained by dividing the transmission coefficient under θ 0 15 60 by that under θ 0 0 12 λ ct θ 1 cos θ 0 3 2 after determining the constants of a and b in eq 11 and directional coefficient in 12 an empirical equation is obtained to predict the transmission coefficient on twin plate breakwater through a simple parameter rnn h d 13 c t 1 cos θ 0 3 2 0 46 ln r n n h d 0 13 3 3 2 reliability analysis to validate the correlation between the measured data and fitted equation a chi square test has been performed on eq 13 the normality test was carried out on the deviation between the measured and fitting transmission coefficients at the significance level of α 0 05 x 2 χ 9 0 05 2 16 92 is considered acceptable based on the validation data listed in table 3 at a significance level of 0 05 x 2 7 51 and x 2 4 24 were achieved under regular and random waves respectively therefore eq 13 passed the hypothesis testing of normality 4 conclusion based on extensively experimental results the performance mechanism of a wave dissipating on twin plate breakwater has been addressed under both normal and oblique incident waves refer to k c number a developed rn number has been defined to evaluate the dissipating performance of twin plate breakwater for bulk estimation empirical equations have been fitted between the measured transmission coefficient and rn number the conclusions are drawn 1 the twin plates change the circular motion of water particles to back and forth flow as well as convert the potential to kinematic energy on the breakwater in addition wave dissipation keeps increasing with the relative plate width 2 the developed rn number combined the effects of relative plate width b l wave steepness h l relative wave height h d and water depth d l the experimental results showed that the developed rn number is simple and effective in estimating the variation of transmission coefficient on the twin plate breakwater 3 based on various data fitting an optimal empirical equation

22284,previous studies have shown that the twin plate breakwater has good performance in wave dissipation in particular under deep water conditions the performance of twin plate breakwater is subjected to several parameters and some of these parameters are coupled to the others thus far there was no simple and effective method to calculate the dissipation coefficient of the twin plate breakwater the objective of the present study is to address the mechanism of wave dissipation and apply the developed rn number to evaluate the dissipating performance on the twin plate breakwater the experimental results showed that the transmission reflection and dissipation coefficients were strongly depending on the developed rn number based on various data fitting an optimal empirical equation is obtained to predict the dissipation of the twin plate breakwater through the developed rn number the empirical equation has been verified by the chi square test and hence can be used for bulk estimation for transmission coefficient under normal and oblique waves keywords twin plate breakwater dissipation performance model test rn number 1 introduction as known the cost of conventional impermeable breakwater increases with the water depth exponentially as well as leads to aquatic environment issues the horizontal twin plate breakwater could be an alternative solution to dissipate wave energy efficiently and has less impacts on water quality several factors are affecting the performance of horizontal plate breakwater i e plate width number of layers plate spacing submerged depth opening modes incident wave height period direction wave steepness water depth etc for single horizontal plate breakwater previous studies reported that the relative plate width relative submerged depth and relative wave height have a significant effect on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the horizontal plate however natural sea level is always changing with tides given the fixed submerged depth of a single plate the dissipation performance of the single plate is unsteady therefore studies on twin and multilayer plate breakwaters were then launched for example wang and shen 1999 usha and gayathri 2005 liu et al 2008 2009 lin 2012 and cho et al 2013 performed analytical and numerical calculations for multilayer submerged plates the numerical results revealed that the reflection and transmission coefficient strongly depend on the relative plate width submerged depth of the top plate and relative water depth besides the number of layers could also impact on the reflection and transmission coefficient for horizontal twin plate the reflection and transmission coefficient subject to the relative plate width and relative water depth the best dissipation performance is achieved with a relative water depth of 0 2 0 6 and a plate width of 0 2 0 3 when incident angle θ ranges from 0 to 60 wave length l θ lcosθ with relative water depth kdcosθ 2 there is minor difference in dissipation performance for normal and oblique waves with kdcosθ 2 however the transmission coefficient decreases with the incident angle model tests of horizontal plate breakwaters have been carried out by cheong and patarapanich 1992 neelamani and gayathri 2006 tang 2006 gu 2009 chen 2010 li 2014 liu 2014 and cho et al 2013 cheong and patarapanich 1992 reported that the transmission coefficient is minimum when the top plate is at the free surface and the ratio of the submerged depth of the lower plate to the water depth is about 0 15 0 20 liu et al 2014 examined the transmission and reflection coefficient of a submerged two layer horizontal porous plate breakwater in regular and irregular with four breakwater models they considered the porosity of the upper plate should be smaller than that of the lower plate to obtain the lower transmission coefficient they also suggested that the optimal ratio of plate width to incident wavelength is about 0 25 0 4 compared to the experimental results of liu et al 2014 and analytical solutions of cho 2013 the difference in the transmission coefficients was enlarged significantly when the plate width was wide cho 2013 pointed out that the dissipation performance of submerged two layer porous plate breakwater was enhanced while plate width was large where the energy loss of porosity was magnified there are few studies on horizontal plate breakwater under oblique waves in particular for model tests of dual plate in oblique waves i e liu 2008 and cho 2013 based on potential theory liu 2008 discussed the interaction and proposed a method to estimate the reflection and transmission coefficient by applying eigen function expansion from their analysis results the dissipation performance of a submerged dual plate breakwater can be improved by reducing the plate thickness or increasing the incident angle thus far there was no simple and effective method to calculate the dissipation coefficient of the twin plate breakwater based on model tests the relationship between the dissipation coefficient and the impact factors has been revealed partially however the applicable quantitative calculation for dissipation performance under an oblique wave is not systematic this study investigates the quantitative evaluation for dissipation performance of horizontal twin plate breakwater the upper plate surface was placed at the mean water level 3d model tests have been carried out with various incident angles to examine the feasibility of estimating twin plate dissipation in the following we firstly present the experimental setup and parameters secondly the dissipation mechanism of twin plate breakwater will be addressed based on the measured transmission and reflection coefficients the developed rn number is then defined to evaluate dissipation performance in the end an empirical equation is proposed to estimate the performance of twin plate breakwater through the developed rn number 2 experimental study 2 1 experimental setup the experiments were carried out in a wave basin at state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology the basin is 40 m long 8 m wide and 1 0 m deep a piston type 3d wave maker is installed at one end of the basin to generate designed waves at the other end of the basin an artificial absorbent beach was installed to dissipate wave energy and minimize reflections effectively previous results have indicated that the beach is effective for wave dissipation and less than 5 of the incident wave energy is reflected with a water depth of 0 5 m the wave height can be generated in the range of 0 05 0 167 m the wave heights were measured using resistance wire wave probes placing at specified locations with a sampling interval of 0 02 s the sampling lengths were 2048 and 8192 for regular and random waves respectively as shown in fig 1 the model of the twin plate breakwater made of wood with waterproof coating was located approximately 19 m away from the wave maker θ 0 is the angle between the wave propagation and normal direction of the breakwater θ r the reflection angle before the breakwater θ t the refraction angle after the breakwater the incident wave direction θ 0 can be changed by adjusting the direction of the twin horizontal plate model one set of 5 wave probes were placed before the breakwater region 1 to obtain the reflection coefficient and the other set of 4 probes were placed after the breakwater region 2 to obtain the transmission coefficient both sets of probes were arranged in a t shape since such configuration can obtain sufficient data to calculate the transmission coefficient after the breakwater yu and liu 1992 the distance from the t center to the breakwater was approximately twice the average wavelength in the current experimental study we take into account the normalized parameters of incident wave height h d hs d wave steepness h l hs l water depth d l and incident angle as well as the dimensionless plate width b l in the tests the breakwater dimensions and water depth are plate width b 100 cm plate spacing s 10 cm s d 0 2 and water

peak enhancement factor γ 3 3 goda 2010 the peak period was in a range of 1 0 2 4s with a significant wave height of h s 0 05 0 175 m the wave parameters for normal and oblique incident waves are summarized in tables 1 and 2 respectively 2 2 measurements and data analysis 2 2 1 experimental wave simulation wave gauges were set on the central line of the model cross section the gauges were calibrated before the measurements and original wave height was measured regular waves were generated by inputting the cosine wave signal and the random waves were generated by simulating the target

breakwater model the wave parameters were calibrated after calibration the twin plate breakwater model was placed in the wave basin then gauges were set at the front and rear part of the plates for measurements the data were recorded until the wave behind the plate became stable in oblique wave tests the variation of the incident angles was controlled by changing the orientations of the breakwater model the wave generation system was equipped with the active wave absorption control system awacs to reduce reflection besides absorbing materials were placed on sidewalls of the basin as well as on the beach to minimize the wave reflection and radiation the basin has been extensively used in our laboratory for various studies previous results have indicated that the beach is effective for wave dissipation and less than 5 of the incident wave energy is reflected all the tests were repeated at least three times and the averages were taken as the final results the transmission reflection and dissipation coefficient satisfy 3 c t 2 c r 2 c l 2 1 where c t c r and c l are the transmission reflection and dissipation coefficient respectively after passing through the breakwater the wave period after the plates could be different from the incident wave period besides the time history sometimes includes many cross zero fluctuations in high frequency with the same sampling length the wave number after breakwater could be significantly more than the incident wave number which underestimates the statistic wave height after breakwater therefore it is not true to calculate the transmission coefficient by ratio the wave heights before and after the breakwater in the present study the transmission coefficient is obtained by ratio the wave energy before and after the breakwater based on the time histories of the incident and transmitted waves measured by the probes before and after the breakwater the spectra of the incident and transmitted waves were obtained by

obtained 4 c t m t m 0 based on the recorded wave elevation before the breakwater the incident and reflected wave spectra can be obtained by using goda s method to separate the incident and reflected

the transmitted wave could deviate from the incident direction such deviation will disturb the back and forth flow between the twin plates and from the lower plate to seabed as a consequence the energy flux in reverse direction becomes weaker and the reflection coefficient decreases as well as dissipation increases figs 9 and 10 demonstrate that the transmission coefficient generally decreases with the oblique angles under both regular and random waves this could be attributed to the following three points 1 increase of water particle movement cross the plates 2 reflection decreases due to the refraction 3 dissipation increases to verify the summary proposed above the variation of transmission coefficient versus rn number rnn is plotted in fig 12 under various incident angles of 0 30 and 45 the experimental parameters ranged in b l s 0 28 0 66 h s l s 0 02 0 07 as well as constant relative wave height of h s d 0 1 and h s d 0 2 the results in fig 12 illustrated that the transmission coefficient under an oblique wave is generally smaller than that under a normal incident wave which verifies the above explanation somehow this is reinforced by the decrease trend of transmission coefficient versus the oblique angle in fig 9 under regular waves 3 3 calculation and validation of transmission coefficient 3 3 1 transmission coefficient estimation by using rnn h d it is illustrated in fig 8 that various logarithmic curves of c t rnn have been well fitted for various h d for bulk estimation in engineering the relationship between c t and rnn h d or rnn h s d is worth to figure out to simplify the fitting equation where h and hs are wave height and significant wave height in regular and random waves respectively the variation of c t rnn h d or rnn h s d under various relative wave heights in regular and random waves is plotted in figs 13 and 14 respectively based on the measurements in figs 13 and 14 the best fitting curves are achieved in logarithmic function as shown in fig 15 it is revealed that a simple empirical equation can be obtained to estimate the transmission coefficient within a certain range of relative wave height h d for example y 0 22ln x 0 26 for regular wave with h d 0 10 0 35 and y 0 46ln x 0 13 for random wave with h s d 0 10 0 30 rnn h d is the ratio of rnn to the relative wave height and combines the coupled effect of b l h d and h l on transmission coefficient the curve fitting indicates that the variation of transmission coefficient versus rnn h d shows good agreement to the logarithm function assuming a directional coefficient λ ct θ 0 independent to rnn the transmission coefficient for oblique wave can be obtained 11 c t λ ct θ 0 a ln r n n h d b where a and b are constants to be determined by data fittings the constants coefficients in eq 11 can be determined through curve fitting on the measured data for example the directional coefficient under oblique irregular waves can be obtained by dividing the transmission coefficient under θ 0 15 60 by that under θ 0 0 12 λ ct θ 1 cos θ 0 3 2 after determining the constants of a and b in eq 11 and directional coefficient in 12 an empirical equation is obtained to predict the transmission coefficient on twin plate breakwater through a simple parameter rnn h d 13 c t 1 cos θ 0 3 2 0 46 ln r n n h d 0 13 3 3 2 reliability analysis to validate the correlation between the measured data and fitted equation a chi square test has been performed on eq 13 the normality test was carried out on the deviation between the measured and fitting transmission coefficients at the significance level of α 0 05 x 2 χ 9 0 05 2 16 92 is considered acceptable based on the validation data listed in table 3 at a significance level of 0 05 x 2 7 51 and x 2 4 24 were achieved under regular and random waves respectively therefore eq 13 passed the hypothesis testing of normality 4 conclusion based on extensively experimental results the performance mechanism of a wave dissipating on twin plate breakwater has been addressed under both normal and oblique incident waves refer to k c number a developed rn number has been defined to evaluate the dissipating performance of twin plate breakwater for bulk estimation empirical equations have been fitted between the measured transmission coefficient and rn number the conclusions are drawn 1 the twin plates change the circular motion of water particles to back and forth flow as well as convert the potential to kinematic energy on the breakwater in addition wave dissipation keeps increasing with the relative plate width 2 the developed rn number combined the effects of relative plate width b l wave steepness h l relative wave height h d and water depth d l the experimental results showed that the developed rn number is simple and effective in estimating the variation of transmission coefficient on the twin plate breakwater 3 based on various data fitting an optimal empirical equation is obtained to predict the transmission of the twin plate breakwater through the developed rn number the empirical equation has been verified by chi square test and hence can be used for bulk estimation in engineering design acknowledgements the work is supported by the foundation for innovative research groups of national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51221961 51879033 and
