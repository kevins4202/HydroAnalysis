22510,to control the wake flow of a short cylinder a passive flow control method a front inclined hole in the cylinder was drilled from the front surface side to the free end surface a cylinder of an aspect ratio h d 1 with a height h 70 mm and a diameter d 70 mm is used a circulation water tunnel is used to perform piv measurements at reynolds number of 8 570 for comparing the flow structures between the no hole and hole wakes in order to consider the influence of the hole position the different cylinder models of the hole height at the front from the wall are tested comparing with the flow structures around standard cylinder it is found that the separation zone near the free end surface decreases and the rear separation ron increases because of the blown flow from the inclined hole the vorticity and reynolds shear stresses are also suppressed in the rear recirculation zone the instantaneous large scale eddies in the rear separation zone are divided into several small scale eddies as increasing the angle of the inclined hole keywords flow measurement passive flow control piv visualization vortex wake 1 introduction it is a well known fact that the flows around a low aspect ratio cylinder exhibit strongly three dimensional complex structures it is very important topic in the engineering fields such as reducing drag and noise for designing the offshore structures heat exchangers structural vibrations automobile building and so on so far the 3d dimensional vortical structures of a finite height cylinder wake which are mainly consist of kármán vortices base vortices horse shoe vortices and trailing vortices have been clarified kawamura et al 1984a b johnston and wilson 1996 tanaka and murata 1999 sumner et al 2004 adaramola et al 2006 the kármán vortices originated from the side of the three dimensional cylinder is largely affected by the aspect ratio because of the free end and the wall at the bottom lee 1997 pattenden et al 2005 goncalves et al 2015 the base vortices are the opposite direction to the tip vortices and cause an upwash flow departing from the wall a pair of base vortices from cylinder wall junction only occurred when the aspect ratio is larger than 3 sumner et al 2004 adaramola et al 2006 wang et al 2006 concluded that the base vortices became stronger when increasing the thickness of the boundary layer which was lately confirmed wang and zhou 2009 as the aspect ratio is less than 3 alternating vortex shedding kárman vortex disappears the flow structures exhibit tip vortices base vortices and horse shoe vortices okamoto and yagita 1993 kawamura et al 1984a b roh and park 2003 krajnović 2011 rostamy et al 2012 at a lower aspect ratio the vortex shedding from the surface of free end interacts with the vortices occurring from the cylinder side before it reaches to the ground and the arch vortex is formed in the near wake lee 1997 krajnović 2011 indicated that the legs of the mean arch vortex leaned to the flow direction and the angle that the vortex and the axis in the flow direction make shows about 31 by performing the simulations the downwash flow influences the whole wake at the case of the lower aspect ratio at the condition of h d 3 which indicates that the possibility of symmetric vortex shedding wang et al 2006 zhu et al 2017 firstly used tomographic piv to measure the three dimensional turbulent structures behind a short plate mounted cylinder with the aspect ratio of two and proposed successfully the instantaneous 3d m shape arch vortex the detail explanation of finite length cylinder wake may refer to the works from sumner 2013 and porteous et al 2014 however little basic investigations focus on the control of the vibration occurring from the vortex in the short cylinder wakes so far there are some passive and active flow control ways for controlling the vortical structures behind the infinite height cylinder the passive flow control method modifies the flow structures without energy from outside new et al 2015 ozkana et al 2017 therefore the passive flow control of a short cylinder is focused in this study according to the artificial process of exciting or manipulating the flow structures the passive flow control may be classified into two strates choi et al 2008 rashidi et al 2016 one method causes instability motions between the cylinder and the oncoming flow for example adding splitter plate to the cylinder and increasing roughness of the cylinder surface as a practice application the infinite circular cylinder having a splitter plate suppressed the vortical oscillations in the transverse direction in the case of submarine cable and vibration cylinder hu and koterayama 1994 the other method suppresses the vortices by external fluid actuators mounted on the cylinders for example suction flow and blowing flow in order to control the vortex shedding in the case of low reynolds numbers the inclined slots which is drilled from the location of front stagnation point to the rear separation point was used on the infinite circular cylinder shi and feng 2015 qu et al 2017 employed a slot synthetic jet issuing from the cylinder s rear surface to control wake vortex evolution of an infinite square cylinder the noise induced by the infinite height cylinder wakes have mainly focused on aeolian tone in constant crossflow ali et al 2013 but few research on controlling the wake vortices of a short cylinder is found which becomes the high spot of the present study recently a passive control method of a sloped hole drilled from the back to the free end surface was used to control the flow around the short cylinder rinoshika et al 2017 it was found that the lengths of rear separation ron are effectively reduced furthermore rinoshika and rinoshika 2018 proposed a horizontal hole drilled from the surface of front to the rear side inside a short cylinder to cause the blowing flow which suppressed the rear separation zone effectively above two techniques belong to the second strategy of the passive flow control the main aim of the wake structure control is generally to suppress the rear circulation zone or the vortices so as to achieve the reduction or increase of the short cylinder drag this paper developed another way of passive flow control to control the vortices near the surface of free end and the separation zone of the low aspect ratio cylinder wake a front inclined hole fih is drilled from the surface of front to the free end inside a cylinder then piv particle image velocimetry is employed to measure the wake flow structures of the hole and no hole low aspect ratio cylinders on the flat plate in the water tunnel finally the discussion and comparison of the mean velocity and vorticity fields reynolds shear stresses and the instantaneous velocity fields between the hole and no hole cylinders are performed 2 experimental setup the experiment was conducted in the circulating water channel in which a series of honeycomb coarse and fine screens guide vane elbow flow straightener were used to even the flow before the contraction into the test section and resulted in the turbulence intensity less than 5 a short circular cylinder having a height h 70 mm and a diameter d 70 mm the aspect ratio of h d 1 as shown in fig 1 a is mounted on a wall plate in the circulating water channel the depth of free surface from the cylinder top is about 200 mm the x y and z axes indicate the streamwise transverse and spanwise directions respectively inside the cylinder as indicated in fig 1 b d a hole with a diameter of d 10 mm d d 0 14 is drilled from the front to the free end side it is referred to the front inclined hole fih for evaluating the effect of the hole height we use three fih models fig 1b d with different hole positions on the front side surface h 20 mm 35 mm and 50 mm expressed as fih20 fih35 and fih50 respectively here the centre of the hole on the surface of free end is fixed at l 30 mm from the leading edge of cylinder a free flow velocity is fix at u 0 16 m s and corresponds to a reynolds number re u d ν of 8 570 the piv tracer particles with a mean diameter of 68 μm are adopted a continuous high intensity laser light sheet illuminates the flow field behind the cylinder a high speed video camera with a recoding rate of 250 fps frame per second is employed to capture the digital images piv measurements of the x z and x y planes are respectively carried out as shown in fig 2 and the x y planes are performed in three x y planes at the positions of z 20 mm 35 mm and 50 mm from the flat plate a measured ron of 200 mm 200 mm having a resolution 1 024 1 024 pixels is used and a piv interrogation window size 32 32 pixels having 50 overlapping is set the flow velocity uncertainty of piv measurement is presumed at 1 5 within the reliability of 95 for charactering the turbulent boundary layer of the plate the mean streamwise velocity and turbulent intensity profiles is also measure by piv at a downstream location x 250 mm x d 3 6 from the leading edge of the plate here all experimental data is obtained at the condition of no obstacle the profiles of normalized mean streamwise velocity u and turbulence intensity u r m s and w r m s are indicated in fig 3 the thickness of the boundary layer δ based on 99 free stream velocity was 39 6 mm at the center position of the mounted cylinder and this turbulent boundary layer exhibited a thickness to diameter ratio of δ d 0 57 however wang et al 2006 indicated that significant influence of the turbulent boundary layer thickness on the flow structure of a finite height cylinder wake was found at about δ d 1 02 3 results and discussions 3 1 mean streamlines and velocity distributions fig 4 indicates the comparison of the mean streamwise velocity u u contours and mean streamlines between the no hole cylinder and fih cylinders having different hole height in the x z plane the range of negative value for u u is drawn by a black dash line of u u 0 that indicates the rear separation area of cylinder in the case of the standard cylinder fig 4a a large eddy behind the cylinder appears at the height 0 71d from the ground plane a mean small scale eddy occurring near the free end is observed at a position approximately 0 43d away from the top leading edge of the cylinder in general the distance from the rear surface of the cylinder to the reattachment point on the plane is defined as the length of the separation ron pattenden et al 2005 in this research the boundary of the rear recirculation zone may be decided by the point where the streamline reattaches on the wall plate x d 1 32 pattenden et al 2005 found that this reattachment point located at x d 1 1 which was decided by the visualization images of surface flow the reason lies in the different reynolds number and how pattenden et al 2005 measured it is also found that the free end surface induces stronger downwash flow at the downstream in the flow direction the time mean streamwise velocity u u contours and streamlines around various fih cylinders are indicated in fig 4 b d the separation zone on the top free end is clearly reduced since the blowing flow of the inclined hole supplies the flow energy as increasing h of the fih i e reducing hole angle in flow direction the recirculation zone near the surface of free end decreases slightly this is because the velocity component in the streamwise direction increases by decreasing the angle of the inclined hole it is described later it suggests that the velocity component in the x direction of blowing flow plays an important role for suppressing the separation zone of the free end the lengths of rear separation zones of the fih cylinders however become larger than that of the no hole cylinder the range of the negative value for u component velocity also increases the small vortex can be observed near the cylinder wall junction due to the influence of the blowing flow from the hole it implies that the blowing flow from the inclined hole generates a strong separation flow or downwash flow and results in the larger area of the rear separation ron it may be relevant to increasing drag force that can be an important application in offshore structures and heat exchangers especially suppressing tsunami energy the mean velocity u u profiles for the no hole and fih cylinders in the x z plane at four positions of the downstream x d 0 2 0 6 1 0 2 0 and the time averaged velocity magnitude at the hole outlet on the free end surface are plotted in fig 5 at x d 0 2 the difference among standard and fih models can be clearly observed near the flat plate the blowing flow from the inclined hole decelerates the main flow and results in the decrease of velocity in the extent of 0 1 z d 0 6 the lowest velocity of the fih35 cylinder is observed in the opposite direction of the flow for all the cylinders at x d 0 6 the velocity of the fih models becomes larger in the opposite direction of the flow in the extent of 0 1 z d 0 7 since the strong upwash flows are induced by the inclined hole flow at x d 1 0 it is evident that the velocity of the fih models increases in the opposite direction of the flow at the extent of 0 z d 0 5 which shows the increase of the upwash flow caused by the inclined hole the velocity difference among standard and fih models becomes smaller at the location of x d 2 0 which implies the effect of the blowing flow coming from the free end surface becomes weaker fig 5 e shows the time averaged velocity magnitude of different cylinder near the centre of the hole outlet on the free end surface it is evident that the velocity magnitude at the hole outlet increases with the height of the hole fig 6 presents the time mean streamwise velocity u u contours and mean streamlines around the no hole cylinder and fih cylinders in the x y plane at z 20 mm the ron of the negative u u enclosed by a dash line fih cylinders become larger than that of the no hole cylinder it is because that the blowing flow from the inclined hole of the top surface induces a strong downwash flow and generates the longer length of the rear separation ron fig 4 it results in the slightly larger area of the negative u u at z 20 mm at the position of z 35 mm the mean streamwise velocity u u contours and mean streamlines for the no hole and fih cylinders are shown in fig 7 the negative velocity zone of fih models becomes smaller and the center of the vertical vortices moves to downstream slightly the negative velocity ron of z 35 mm becomes smaller than that of z 20 mm the mean streamwise velocity u u contours and mean streamlines around the no hole and fih models at z 50 mm are presented in fig 8 the separation rons of the fih cylinders become larger than that of the no hole cylinder it is because the tip vortices generated from the free end and the blowing flow influence the wake flow structure and make the increase of the negative velocity range the largest zone of the negative velocity appears in the fih50 wake since the small angle of the inclined hole generates a high horizontal velocity component from the hole fig 9 a d shows the mean streamwise velocity u u profiles at z 35 mm at the locations of x d 0 2 0 6 1 0 2 0 at the location of x d 0 2 the velocities of the fih models become smaller than that of the no hole model in the extent of 1 5 y d 0 7 this is because the blowing flow coming from the hole accelerates upwash and downwash flows and influences the generation of vertical vortices from the side surface the fih50 cylinder exhibits the highest velocity among the three fih cylinders due to high velocity from the inclined hole in the streamwise direction in the case of x d 0 6 the u u of the fih models decreases in the opposite direction of the flow within the range of 0 5 y d 0 for 1 5 y d 0 75 the velocity of the fih models is also smaller than that of the no hole cylinder and the fih50 model exhibits the higher velocity than other two fih models it implies that the effect of the blowing flow coming from the hole on upwash and downwash flows becomes more evident at the location of x d 1 0 the velocity difference between the fih and standard cylinders increases in the range of 0 5 y d 0 owing to the effect of blowing flow issued from the inclined hole as x d increases to 2 0 the velocity difference between the fih and standard cylinders decreases within the range of 0 5 y d 0 and the velocity difference is also evident in the range of 1 5 y d 0 75 it indicates that the effect of blowing flow coming from the inclined hole on the vertical vortices occurred from the side surface of cylinder is retained at the downstream the velocity profile of fih50 cylinder exhibits different distribution from other fih cylinder and standard cylinder it indicates that x velocity component of blowing flow coming from the inclined hole plays important effect on the wake structures the contours of time mean vorticity ω z d u at z 35 mm are presented in fig 10 the value of the maximum vorticity of the fih cylinders becomes smaller than that of the no hole cylinder ω z d u 8 owning to the influence of the blowing flow from the hole the maximum vorticity of the fih20 ω z d u 7 shows the highest value among three fih cylinders it is because the angle of the blowing flow in the flow direction is the largest and causes the strong interaction with the main flow which results in increasing the vorticity fig 11 shows the reynolds shear stress u w u 2 contours in the x z plane of y d 0 here the boundary line of separation area is also plotted by a dash line the maximum positive value 0 04 and maximum negative value 0 03 appear around the free end surface in the no hole cylinder wake fig 11a another negative peak u w u 2 0 03 is found at the position of x d 0 9 and z d 0 7 in the separation zone in the case of fih cylinders the positive values of reynolds shear stresses can be seen near the hole of the top free end on the other hand the negative values of reynolds shear stresses are observed in the separation ron the maximum value of fih35 and fih50 is about 0 03 and that of fih20 is about 0 04 which appear around the front edge of the top free end comparing with the standard cylinder reynolds shear stress slightly decreases near the free end but the zone of the reynolds shear stress increases behind the cylinder when the hole height of the front side increases reynolds shear stress weakens this is because the inclined angle of the hole decides the vertical velocity component of the blowing flow and influences or alters the flow structures near the fih cylinder therefore both the reynolds shear stresses and the recirculation zone are controlled reynolds shear stress u v u 2 contours in the x y plane of z 35 mm are plotted in fig 12 the no hole cylinder wake shows a maximum value u v u 2 0 04 near the boundary of reverse flow ron fig 12a comparing with the case of the standard cylinder reynolds shear stresses of the fih cylinders decrease because of the effect of the blowing flow when the hole height increases the maximum magnitude of reynolds shear stress decreases the reynolds shear stress of fih20 is the largest of all which indicates 0 03 due to the large angle of the inclined hole it implies that the blowing flow generated by the fih reduces the turbulent fluctuation made by the recirculation flow which suppresses the occurrence of reynolds shear stress u v u 2 to analyse the turbulent energy distributions we use reynolds normal stresses u 2 u 2 w 2 u 2 of the streamwise and spanwise directions in the x z plane to compute the turbulent kinetic energy t k e 0 75 u 2 u 2 w 2 u 2 lim and lee 2003 fig 13 exhibits contours of the turbulent kinetic energy tke for no hole and fih cylinders in the x z plane at y d 0 the maximum tke 0 12 of the standard cylinder is evidently observed near the free end and the boundary of reverse flow ron but the maximum magnitude of tke 0 14 of the fih models appears around the hole tke of the rear recirculation zone of the fih cylinders is larger than that of the no hole cylinder owning to the effect of the blowing flow from the hole as increasing the angle of the inclined hole the ron of maximum tke increases near the free end since the vertical velocity component from the hole increases on the contrary the ron of maximum tke behind the cylinder increases owning to the increase of x velocity component from the hole the tke contours at z 35 mm are shown in fig 14 the maximum tke 1 0 of the standard cylinder is observed in the side shear layer the maximum tke of the fih20 cylinder increases to 0 11 the direction of the blowing flow may influence the flow structure and the large vertical velocity component results in the increase of the tke however the maximum tke of the fih35 and fih50 cylinders decreases approaching at tke 0 08 the range of tke of the fih50 is larger than that of the fih35 because the hole of fih50 inclines closer to the flow direction and increases horizontal velocity component fig 15 shows the spectra ev for the velocity component v in the wakes of the no hole and fih models at the position of x d 0 5 and y d 0 6 this position approximately locates at the vertical vortex path in the wake of the no hole cylinder located at z 35 mm as indicated in fig 15a a peak is found near 0 45hz which corresponds to strouhal number of st 0 20 it implies the occurrence of vertical vortices generated by the side surface however the peaks of the fih20 fih35 and fih50 as shown in fig 15b d are found around 0 35hz st 0 15 1 3 hz st 0 57 and 2 1 hz st 0 92 respectively the large vertical velocity component from the hole of fih20 involves in the large scale vertical vortex of the side shear layer and increases the vortex formation length on the contrary as the height of the hole decreases the horizontal velocity component from the hole increases and results in the suppression of the large vertical vortex for comparing the flow structures of the standard cylinder with the fih models the typical instantaneous streamlines of the x z plane are shown in fig 16 a large eddy in the rear recirculation area and two small vortices near the surface of free end are evidently found in the cylinder wake of no hole fig 16a such a large eddy can be identified as part of arch vortex generated by the downwash flow from the free end a saddle point can be found around the reattachment point which implies the weaker upwash flow from wall in the case of the low aspect ratio cylinder in the case of the fih models however the large vortex of the rear separation ron is divided into several small vortices owning to the influence of the blowing flow from the inclined hole as the angle of the hole increases the number of vortices increases especially several vortices appear near the cylinder wall junction this result implies that the angle of the blowing flow from the hole influences the wake flow and generates small vortices the rear separation rons of the fih models become larger than that of the standard model fig 17 exhibits the comparison of typical instantaneous streamlines between the no hole and fih cylinders at z 35 mm it is observed that the several vortices in the cylinder wake of no hole fig 17a are generated due to the shear layer separation on the both sides of the model however the blowing flow from the inclined hole makes the increase of vertical vortex number in the rear recirculation zone fig 17b d it is because the hole flow increases the downwash and upwash flows focusing on the case of the fih35 the size of the vortices behind the cylinder becomes smaller it indicates that the angle of the inclined hole may be used to adjust the sizes of the vortices it also impels that the thickness of the leg of the arch vortex decreases and several small vortices appear behind it 4 conclusions comparing with the wake of the no hole short cylinder the effects of the inclined hole on the flow structures are described as follows 1 the size of the separation zone near the free end surface decreases the rear separation ron of the fih cylinders however increases 2 the hole flow of fih models reduced the vorticity concentration generated by the side shear flow the maximum reynolds shear stress of the fih models is also suppressed by the blowing flow from the inclined hole 3 the dominating frequency generating from the vortices shedding in the side shear flow increases for the fih35 and fih50 cylinders however the dominate frequency of the vortices of the fih20 cylinder decreases 4 as for the instantaneous flow structures around the fih cylinders the large eddy is divided into several relative small scale vortices in the rear separation ron the number of vortices increases when increasing the inclined angle of the hole acknowledgement the first author hr gratefully acknowledges support from jsps research fellowships for young scientists 2019 2022 the second author ar wishes to acknowledge support

downstream in the flow direction the time mean streamwise velocity u u contours and streamlines around various fih cylinders are indicated in fig 4 b d the separation zone on the top free end is clearly reduced since the blowing flow of the inclined hole supplies the flow energy as increasing h of the fih i e reducing hole angle in flow direction the recirculation zone near the surface of free end decreases slightly this is because the velocity component in the streamwise direction increases by decreasing the angle of the inclined hole it is described later it suggests that the velocity component in the x direction of blowing flow plays an important role for suppressing the separation zone of the free end the lengths of rear separation zones of the fih cylinders however become larger than that of the no hole cylinder the range of the negative value for u component velocity also increases the small vortex can be observed near the cylinder wall junction due to the influence of the blowing flow from the hole it implies that the blowing flow from the inclined hole generates a strong separation flow or downwash flow and results in the larger area of the rear separation ron it may be relevant to increasing drag force that can be an important application in offshore structures and heat exchangers especially suppressing tsunami energy the mean velocity u u profiles for the no hole and fih cylinders in the x z plane at four positions of the downstream x d 0 2 0 6 1 0 2 0 and the time averaged velocity magnitude at the hole outlet on the free end surface are plotted in fig 5 at x d 0 2 the difference among standard and fih models can be clearly observed near the flat plate the blowing flow from the inclined hole decelerates the main flow and results in the decrease of velocity in the extent of 0 1 z d 0 6 the lowest velocity of the fih35 cylinder is observed in the opposite direction of the flow for all the cylinders at x d 0 6 the velocity of the fih models becomes larger in the opposite direction of the flow in the extent of 0 1 z d 0 7 since the strong upwash flows are induced by the inclined hole flow at x d 1 0 it is evident that the velocity of the fih models increases in the opposite direction of the flow at the extent of 0 z d 0 5 which shows the increase of the upwash flow caused by the inclined hole the velocity difference among standard and fih models becomes smaller at the location of x d 2 0 which implies the effect of the blowing flow coming from the free end surface becomes weaker fig 5 e shows the time averaged velocity magnitude of different cylinder near the centre of the hole outlet on the free end surface it is evident that the velocity magnitude at the hole outlet increases with the height of the hole fig 6 presents the time mean streamwise velocity u u contours and mean streamlines around the no hole cylinder and fih cylinders in the x y plane at z 20 mm the ron of the negative u u enclosed by a dash line fih cylinders become larger than that of the no hole cylinder it is because that the blowing flow from the inclined hole of the top surface induces a strong downwash flow and generates the longer length of the rear separation ron fig 4 it results in the slightly larger area of the negative u u at z 20 mm at the position of z 35 mm the mean streamwise velocity u u contours and mean streamlines for the no hole and fih cylinders are shown in fig 7 the negative velocity zone of fih models becomes smaller and the center of the vertical vortices moves to downstream slightly the negative velocity ron of z 35 mm becomes smaller than that of z 20 mm the mean streamwise velocity u u contours and mean streamlines around the no hole and fih models at z 50 mm are presented in fig 8 the separation rons of the fih cylinders become larger than that of the no hole cylinder it is because the tip vortices generated from the free end and the blowing flow influence the wake flow structure and make the increase of the negative velocity range the largest zone of the negative velocity appears in the fih50 wake since the small angle of the inclined hole generates a high horizontal velocity component from the hole fig 9 a d shows the mean streamwise velocity u u profiles at z 35 mm at the locations of x d 0 2 0 6 1 0 2 0 at the location of x d 0 2 the velocities of the fih models become smaller than that of the no hole model in the extent of 1 5 y d 0 7 this is because the blowing flow coming from the hole accelerates upwash and downwash flows and influences the generation of vertical vortices from the side surface the fih50 cylinder exhibits the highest velocity among the three fih cylinders due to high velocity from the inclined hole in the streamwise direction in the case of x d 0 6 the u u of the fih models decreases in the opposite direction of the flow within the range of 0 5 y d 0 for 1 5 y d 0 75 the velocity of the fih models is also smaller than that of the no hole cylinder and the fih50 model exhibits the higher velocity than other two fih models it implies that the effect of the blowing flow coming from the hole on upwash and downwash flows becomes more evident at the location of x d 1 0 the velocity difference between the fih and standard cylinders increases in the range of 0 5 y d 0 owing to the effect of blowing flow issued from the inclined hole as x d increases to 2 0 the velocity difference between the fih and standard cylinders decreases within the range of 0 5 y d 0 and the velocity difference is also evident in the range of 1 5 y d 0 75 it indicates that the effect of blowing flow coming from the inclined hole on the vertical vortices occurred from the side surface of cylinder is retained at the downstream the velocity profile of fih50 cylinder exhibits different distribution from other fih cylinder and standard cylinder it indicates that x velocity component of blowing flow coming from the inclined hole plays important effect on the wake structures the contours of time mean vorticity ω z d u at z 35 mm are presented in fig 10 the value of the maximum vorticity of the fih cylinders becomes smaller than that of the no hole cylinder ω z d u 8 owning to the influence of the blowing flow from the hole the maximum vorticity of the fih20 ω z d u 7 shows the highest value among three fih cylinders it is because the angle of the blowing flow in the flow direction is the largest and causes the strong interaction with the main flow which results in increasing the vorticity fig 11 shows the reynolds shear stress u w u 2 contours in the x z plane of y d 0 here the boundary line of separation area is also plotted by a dash line the maximum positive value 0 04 and maximum negative value 0 03 appear around the free end surface in the no hole cylinder wake fig 11a another negative peak u w u 2 0 03 is found at the position of x d 0 9 and z d 0 7 in the separation zone in the case of fih cylinders the positive values of reynolds shear stresses can be seen near the hole of the top free end on the other hand the negative values of reynolds shear stresses are observed in the separation ron the maximum value of fih35 and fih50 is about 0 03 and that of fih20 is about 0 04 which appear around the front edge of the top free end comparing with the standard cylinder reynolds shear stress slightly decreases near the free end but the zone of the reynolds shear stress increases behind the cylinder when the hole height of the front side increases reynolds shear stress weakens this is because the inclined angle of the hole decides the vertical velocity component of the blowing flow and influences or alters the flow structures near the fih cylinder therefore both the reynolds shear stresses and the recirculation zone are controlled reynolds shear stress u v u 2 contours in the x y plane of z 35 mm are plotted in fig 12 the no hole cylinder wake shows a maximum value u v u 2 0 04 near the boundary of reverse flow ron fig 12a comparing with the case of the standard cylinder reynolds shear stresses of the fih cylinders decrease because of the effect of the blowing flow when the hole height increases the maximum magnitude of reynolds shear stress decreases the reynolds shear stress of fih20 is the largest of all which indicates 0 03 due to the large angle of the inclined hole it implies that the blowing flow generated by the fih reduces the turbulent fluctuation made by the recirculation flow which suppresses the occurrence of reynolds shear stress u v u 2 to analyse the turbulent energy distributions we use reynolds normal stresses u 2 u 2 w 2 u 2 of the streamwise and spanwise directions in the x z plane to compute the turbulent kinetic energy t k e 0 75 u 2 u 2 w 2 u 2 lim and lee 2003 fig 13 exhibits contours of the turbulent kinetic energy tke for no hole and fih cylinders in the x z plane at y d 0 the maximum tke 0 12 of the standard cylinder is evidently observed near the free end and the boundary of reverse flow ron but the maximum magnitude of tke 0 14 of the fih models appears around the hole tke of the rear recirculation zone of the fih cylinders is larger than that of the no hole cylinder owning to the effect of the blowing flow from the hole as increasing the angle of the inclined hole the ron of maximum tke increases near the free end since the vertical velocity component from the hole increases on the contrary the ron of maximum tke behind the cylinder increases owning to the increase of x velocity component from the hole the tke contours at z 35 mm are shown in fig 14 the maximum tke 1 0 of the standard cylinder is observed in the side shear layer the maximum tke of the fih20 cylinder increases to 0 11 the direction of the blowing flow may influence the flow structure and the large vertical velocity component results in the increase of the tke however the maximum tke of the fih35 and fih50 cylinders decreases approaching at tke 0 08 the range of tke of the fih50 is larger than that of the fih35 because the hole of fih50 inclines closer to the flow direction and increases horizontal velocity component fig 15 shows the spectra ev for the velocity component v in the wakes of the no hole and fih models at the position of x d 0 5 and y d 0 6 this position approximately locates at the vertical vortex path in the wake of the no hole cylinder located at z 35 mm as indicated in fig 15a a peak is found near 0 45hz which corresponds to strouhal number of st 0 20 it implies the occurrence of vertical vortices generated by the side surface however the peaks of the fih20 fih35 and fih50 as shown in fig 15b d are found around 0 35hz st 0 15 1 3 hz st 0 57 and 2 1 hz st 0 92 respectively the large vertical velocity component from the hole of fih20 involves in the large scale vertical vortex of the side shear layer and increases the vortex formation length on the contrary as the height of the hole decreases the horizontal velocity component from the hole increases and results in the suppression of the large vertical vortex for comparing the flow structures of the standard cylinder with the fih models the typical instantaneous streamlines of the x z plane are shown in fig 16 a large eddy in the rear recirculation area and two small vortices near the surface of free end are evidently found in the cylinder wake of no hole fig 16a such a large eddy can be identified as part of arch vortex generated by the downwash flow from the free end a saddle point can be found around the reattachment point which implies the weaker upwash flow from wall in the case of the low aspect ratio cylinder in the case of the fih models however the large vortex of the rear separation ron is divided into several small vortices owning to the influence of the blowing flow from the inclined hole as the angle of the hole increases the number of vortices increases especially several vortices appear near the cylinder wall junction this result implies that the angle of the blowing flow from the hole influences the wake flow and generates small vortices the rear separation rons of the fih models become larger than that of the standard model fig 17 exhibits the comparison of typical instantaneous streamlines between the no hole and fih cylinders at z 35 mm it is observed that the several vortices in the cylinder wake of no hole fig 17a are generated due to the shear layer separation on the both sides of the model however the blowing flow from the inclined hole makes the increase of vertical vortex number in the rear recirculation zone fig 17b d it is because the hole flow increases the downwash and upwash flows focusing on the case of the fih35 the size of the vortices behind the cylinder becomes smaller it indicates that the angle of the inclined hole may be used to adjust the sizes of the vortices it also impels that the thickness of the leg of the arch vortex decreases and several small vortices appear behind it 4 conclusions comparing with the wake of the no hole short cylinder the effects of the inclined hole on the flow structures are described as follows 1 the size of the separation zone near the free end surface decreases the rear separation ron of the fih cylinders however increases 2 the hole flow of fih models reduced the vorticity concentration generated by the side shear flow the maximum reynolds shear stress of the fih models is also suppressed by the blowing flow from the inclined hole 3 the dominating frequency generating from the vortices shedding in the side shear flow increases for the fih35 and fih50 cylinders however the dominate frequency of the vortices of the fih20 cylinder decreases 4 as for the instantaneous flow structures around the fih cylinders the large eddy is divided into several relative small scale vortices in the rear separation ron the number of vortices increases when increasing the inclined

22511,this work describes an adaptive trajectory tracking controller for underactuated underwater vehicles the control design process is two fold first a high level kinematic controller is designed to produce velocity commands that steer the vehicle towards the desired trajectory and second a low level controller is designed to utilize the mathematical model of the vehicle to produce force and torque commands for the thrusters onboard the underwater vehicle a novel adaptive nussbaum function based controller is proposed and compared with an adaptive proportional controller with integral feedback further a conditional adaptation scheme is developed to combat effects of noise disturbance or uncertainty the proposed scheme governs adaptation such that the gains only adapt when it is necessary even in the presence of noise the target vehicle for the controller is a four thruster quadcopter like vehicle which does not have direct control over all degrees of freedom the issue of having an underactuated thruster arrangement is common in many classes of inspection robots the devised adaptive control law exhibits fast convergence for the adaptation four different parametrized trajectories are tested and the performance of the proposed algorithms when considering the tracking errors and required control effort is shown to be superior to an adaptive proportional controller keywords adaptive control underactuated underwater vehicle nussbaum function 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are types of marine craft that are deployed to execute surveillance and reconnaissance missions for the military inspection and identification tasks for the construction and oil and gas industries payload delivery assignments and search and salvage operations auvs are essential to the operation of many industries today button et al 2009 palomeras et al 2018 the auv control problem is a rather challenging one aneke 2003 aneke et al 2003 underwater vehicles present difficult control design problems because their dynamics are described using coupled nonlinear dynamic equations with six degrees of freedom thus a lot of effort is needed to acquire precise models for auvs also unpredictable disturbances that are present in an underwater environment in which such a vehicle operates are difficult to estimate du et al 2018 further a majority of auvs deployed in the field are underactuated in nature that is although the nature of the motion is kinematically admissible they have fewer actuators than degrees of freedom so motion to attain a certain position is dictated by the actuator arrangement used the motion control task can be a point to point motion problem where the system has to reach a final configuration from an initial configuration a path following problem where the system has to both reach a final configuration from an initial configuration and follow a geometric path or a trajectory following problem whereby the path following problem is associated with a timing law for reaching certain positions martin and whitcomb 2012 this work proposes a trajectory tracking controller for an underactuated underwater vehicle this is coupled with an adaptation law to enable robustness to external disturbance and deployability in unknown environments literature presents a multitude of approaches to tackle the control problem one of the simpler approaches to solving the control problem is line of sight los path following where the marine craft is required to move at a constant forward speed and a heading controller leads the marine craft to converge to the parametrized path fossen et al 2015 fossen and lekkas 2017 sliding mode control is used in literature to design controllers that are exponentially stable and capable of following trajectories in wadoo and kachroo 2016 the authors tackle the problem of designing control laws for a 4 thruster underactuated marine craft first the dynamics are transformed into chained form coordinates a kinematic control law is then devised for point to point motion as well as trajectory following tasks finally a dynamic control law which is also designed around the transformed coordinates is coupled with the kinematic control law to realize force and moment based control rather than velocity control the stability of the laws is investigated and proven in wadoo and kachroo 2016 another auv with 4 actuators is treated in watanabe et al 2013 where a second order chained form transformation is coupled with a discontinuous control method to attain a globally stable system this controller is verified through simulation in lim and jung 2013 an underactuated quadcopter system is stabilized in attitude using a time delayed controller which outperforms results achieved using a pid controller especially for disturbance rejection the control method is concerned with estimating the dynamic state of the system and providing compensation through control action adaptive control is treated in the literature in many works an adaptive lookahead distance los control law to guide autonomous underwater vehicles is proposed in fossen and lekkas 2017 also fossen et al 2015 adapts another los based approach to make the vehicle robust to disturbances in the form of unpredictable water current and rezazadegan et al 2015 proposes an adaptive backstepping approach to deal with parameter uncertainties when controlling auvs a hierarchical robust nonlinear controller is designed in karkoub et al 2017 to guide an underactuated auv subject to uncertainties in a trajectory the controller utilizes back stepping and sliding mode control techniques in a hierarchical structure that is based on the kinematic and dynamic models of the auv second order sliding mode control is exploited in the design of an adaptive path following controller in zhang et al 2018 the proposed adaptation affects the controller s damping ratio to eliminate the chattering phenomenon commonly observed in sliding mode control other recent works that address the control design problem include lapierre 2009 which focuses on robust diving as well as rezazadegan et al 2015 which studies simultaneous auv control and parameter estimation this work proposes a novel adaptive nussbaum function based controller to solve the trajectory tracking problem for an underactuated auv a conditional adaptation routine is also devised to manage the adaptation and the performance of the proposed approach is compared against an adaptive proportional controller the devised controllers aim to reduce the control effort necessary to guide underactuated auvs four parametrized trajectories are tested in simulation to validate the proposed approach the paper is organized as follows after the introduction the mathematical model for the underactuated vehicle is presented then the proposed high and low level controllers as well as the adaptive algorithms are derived and stability of the approaches is proven the proposed algorithms are then extensively tested in a simulated environment and quantitative monte carlo results are presented finally conclusions and avenues for future work are presented 2 vehicle mathematical model 2 1 vehicle design the vehicle prototype is shown in fig 1 where the cad model is rendered in a simulated environment to showcase the prototype the prototype is cylindrical in shape and is actuated through means of four brushless motor based thrusters the pressurized hull is made out of polyvinyl chloride pvc plastic and it employs o rings to realize a watertight seal the prototype is tethered to a surface station in its current form not shown in the cad render and it is powered using lithium polymer batteries housed inside the main hull as the prototype undergoes design iterations a hydrodynamic hull might be added to improve the hydrodynamic characteristics of the vehicle 2 2 nomenclature the society of naval architects and marine engineers sname have established standard terminology to describe positions attitudes velocities forces and moments that describe marine vessel poses as well as generalized forces experienced by the vessel table 1 presents the terminology used throughout this work fig 2 shows a diagram of the vehicle with its different frames of motion section 2 3 below details the use of the coordinate frames used also in fig 2 the point g denotes the center of gravity point e represents the nose of the vehicle and r 1 represents the position of the center of the first thruster further details about the thruster allocation matrices are available in section 2 7 2 3 kinematic equations of motion the kinematic vehicle model describes the relationship between the body fixed coordinate frame and the earth fixed coordinate frame which we denote as the b frame and the n frame respectively these are shown in fig 2 here the n frame is one that presumes that auvs do not transverse large distances therefore the rate of rotation of earth ω e 7 2921 1 0 5 r a d s is neglected the forces induced by the rotation of earth are negligible compared to body forces of the vehicle the pose of the vehicle ζ in the n frame is given by 1 ζ j q ν p n q r q 0 3 3 0 4 3 1 2 t q υ ω where p n x y z t is thevehicle position in the n frame q η ϵ t t η ϵ 1 ϵ 2 ϵ 3 t is the unit quaternion that represents the attitude of the vehicle and υ u v w t and ω p q r t are the vehicle linear and angular velocities in the b frame the matrix r q is a rotation matrix details of which are provided below in 3 the matrix t q relates the time rate of change of the quaternion q to the angular velocities vector ω this is shown in 5 the unit quaternions are complex numbers with four bases and they form a singularity free solution for describing attitude over euler s angles of roll pitch and yaw unit quaternions satisfy the following constraint equation kuipers 1999 2 q t q η 2 ϵ t ϵ η 2 ϵ 1 2 ϵ 2 2 ϵ 3 2 1 the rotation matrix r q s o 3 is a special orthogonal matrix that maps quantities in the b frame to the n frame also the following relation r q r q t i where i is an identity matrix holds for r q further the matrix r q t maps quantities in the n frame to the b frame the matrix r q can be constructed as in fossen 2011 as follows 3 r q i 3 3 2 η s ϵ 2 s ϵ 2 1 2 ϵ 2 2 ϵ 3 2 2 ϵ 1 ϵ 2 ϵ 3 η 2 ϵ 1 ϵ 3 ϵ 2 η 2 ϵ 1 ϵ 2 ϵ 3 η 1 2 ϵ 1 2 ϵ 3 2 2 ϵ 2 ϵ 3 ϵ 1 η 2 ϵ 1 ϵ 3 ϵ 2 η 2 ϵ 2 ϵ 3 ϵ 1 η 1 2 ϵ 1 2 ϵ 2 2 where i 3 3 is a 3 3 identity matrix and s a s a t is the skew symmetric matrix defined as 4 s a 0 a 3 a 2 a 3 0 a 1 a 2 a 1 0 where a a 1 a 2 a 3 t such that the cross product operation a b between three dimensional vectors a b can be represented by s a b the relation between the time rate of change of quaternions and the angular velocity vector can be shown to be 5 q 1 2 ϵ t η i 3 3 s ϵ ω 1 2 ϵ 1 ϵ 2 ϵ 3 η ϵ 3 ϵ 2 ϵ 3 η ϵ 1 ϵ 2 ϵ 1 η ω t q ω for the vehicle shown in figs 1 b and 2 and to focus on motion in the surge direction the kinematic model in eq 1 can then be rewritten as 6 p n q r q 1 3 0 1 3 0 4 3 1 2 t q u ω where r q 1 3 is the first row of r q which describes the relation between the surge motion in the b frame and the change in position in the n frame this gives rise to control problems as the sway and heave motions are not directly exploitable in control design 2 4 rigid body dynamics the newton euler equations of motion for a rigid body yield 7 m ν ω ν ω r g ω ω r g τ 1 i b ω ω i b ω m r g ν ω ν τ 2 where r g x g y g z g t is the center of gravity of the vehicle m is the mass of the vehicle i b is the 3 3 inertia matrix of the vehicle with respect to r g and τ τ 1 t τ 2 t t x y z k l m t is the generalized vector of external forces τ 1 and moments τ 2 applied on the vehicle following sname notation as in table 1 and ν u v w p q r t i e the velocities as per table 1 the rigid body dynamics can be factored into a rigid body mass matrix m r b and a coriolis and centrifugal forces matrix c r b which can be written in the following form 8 m r b ν c r b ν τ where 9 m r b m i 3 3 m s r g m s r g i b c r b 0 3 3 s m 11 υ m 12 ω s m 11 υ m 12 ω s m 12 t υ m 22 ω where m i j is one of the four 3 3 matrices forming m r b 2 5 hydrodynamics hydrodynamic effects on the vehicle are twofold they are added mass in addition to damping 2 5 1 hydrodynamic mass added mass is a fluid structure interaction phenomenon that affects the motion of solid structures in a fluid medium this interaction appears in the form of an additional force required to accelerate the body in the medium the interaction is governed by numerous criteria like the geometry of the moving body the orientation of the body the type and amount of fluid surrounding the body and the frequency of excitation of waves fackrell 2011 han and xu 1996 this phenomenon results in a change to the apparent mass of the vehicle that impedes the acceleration of the vehicle in the devised model the effect of added mass is accounted for as a change in the apparent mass matrix of the vehicle for a geometrically symmetric vehicle the added mass matrix is symmetric and is taken to be of the following form 10 m a x u x v x w x p x q x r y u y v y w y p y q y r z u z v z w z p z q z r k u k v k w k p k q k r m u m v m w m p m q m r n u n v n w n p n q n r where x w is a force in the x direction due to acceleration in the z direction k v is a moment around the x direction due to acceleration in the y direction and the same nomenclature follows for the rest of the forces and moments as per sname notation the notion of hydrodynamic mass introduces coriolis and centrifugal forces to the model which are accounted for by a matrix c a and this matrix takes the form of c r b in eq 9 except that m a i j replaces m r b i j the complete dynamic model accounting for all such effects is available in 15 2 5 2 hydrodynamic damping hydrodynamic damping represents the dissipative forces that can resist the motion of a marine craft which are lumped in the vector d ν d l d q ν where d l d q r 6 6 are the linear and quadratic damping matrices accounting for skin friction and quadratic drag fossen 2011 and the operator represents the hadamard product whereas by ν we mean the element wise absolute value of ν the matrix d ν is strictly positive 11 d ν 0 6 6 ν t d ν ν 0 ν 0 2 6 restoring forces and moments hydrostatic effects on the vehicle comprise the restoring forces matrix g q which describes gravitational forces f g as well as buoyant forces f b acting through and about the centers of gravity and buoyancy of the vehicle they can be represented in the b frame as 12 f g r q t 0 0 w f b r q t 0 0 b where w m g is the weight of the vehicle and b ρ g is the buoyancy force with ρ being the density of water and being the volume of the vehicle the restoring forces matrix is then 13 g q f g f b r g f g r b f b where r g and r b are the centers of gravity and buoyancy of the vehicle which are designed to be far apart in the vertical direction this gives the vehicle natural pitch and roll stability and eliminates the need to implement attitude control note that g q is written in terms of quaternions 2 7 actuation the external forces exerted on the vehicle are those arising from actuation through thrusters and those arising from the environmental currents control of the vehicle is achieved through thrusters which are modeled by the thruster allocation matrix actuation of each thruster results in a thrust force applied on the location of the thruster a moment of that force about the center of gravity of the vehicle and a reaction torque on the vehicle that is a result of the rotary motion of the propeller the rotational torque is neglected here because the vehicle has natural roll and pitch stability and the effect is negligible in comparison with the hydrodynamic forces the vehicle experiences the thruster allocation matrix maps the input signal of all the actuators to the resulting forces moments and torques on the vehicle and it is given by 14 τ i 1 i n f i i 1 i n r i f i 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 l l l l l l l l thruster allocation matrix f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 where f i and r i f i are the force and moment generated by thruster i and n 4 is the number of thrusters installed here l is the perpendicular distance between any of the four thrusters and the center of gravity r g 2 8 dynamic equations of motion accounting for all the above effects the standard dynamic model in the b frame can be written as fossen 2011 15 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g q τ where m m r b m a c c r b c a and d ν d l d q ν all the vehicle model parameters in this section need to be identified for accurate simulation and control purposes 2 9 vehicle parameters the vehicle parameters used in all the simulations here are the ones we identified in wadi et al 2018 table 2 details the identified rigid body parameters of the vehicle table 3 describes the drag profile parameters of the vehicle and table 4 presents the added inertia parameters of the vehicle 3 controller design as a consequence of the underactuated nature of the underwater vehicle while the vehicle can reach any position in its configuration space it is constrained in the way that motion can happen submarines are examples of underactuated underwater vehicles because they are usually equipped with a thruster that propels the vehicle forward and two stern planes that introduce pitch and yaw moments similarly the auv can only generate thrust in the forward direction and moments about all axes this makes the control nontrivial and simpler control techniques like state feedback become inapplicable wadoo and kachroo 2016 consequently a subset of the degrees of freedom that can be actuated is exploited in a manner that allows the vehicle to accomplish the tasks required of it here trajectory tracking is the task we focus on for it is a common task that underwater vehicles are required to perform the control law proposed is an extension of control laws that are typically applied on underactuated wheeled robots thrun et al 2005 the authors in alonge et al 2001 propose the same law for an underactuated underwater vehicle but the controller tuning is done manually our work is novel with regards to the type of self tuning adaptation law proposed for use with auvs as well as in the tuning conditions algorithm the control architecture is presented in fig 3 3 1 kinematic controller based on the kinematic model derived in eq 1 it is of interest to devise a control law that exclusively makes use of the actuatable degrees of freedom in tracking a given trajectory first the position and velocity of point e in fig 4 is to be described where point e is a lookahead distance usually employed in line of sight path following algorithms in the inertial frame point e is described as 16 η e x e y e z e t υ e u e v e w e t with the velocities written in terms of the translational velocity υ g and rotational velocity ω of the vehicle as 17 υ e υ g ω r g e where the relative distance between points g and e is the distance ϵ along the x axis of the body frame of the vehicle 18 r g e ϵ 0 0 t in 18 ϵ is simply the constant distance from the center of gravity of the vehicle to the nose of the vehicle picking the point e allows us to write the dynamics in such a way so that the controller can be used to cancel some terms thus enabling a path to showing stability this is similar to feedback linearization of systems and such approaches are commonly used for ground robot waypoint navigation control al khatib et al 2015 to formulate the kinematic control law the kinematic model is first used to describe the velocities in eq 17 in the n frame as 19 η e r q υ g ω r g e q t q ω where υ g u 0 0 t and ω 0 q r t are inputs and the rest of the velocities are taken as disturbances the trajectory following problem is to design a control law that can force the vehicle whose position is described by 19 to follow the desired continuous trajectory described by some η e d e s η e d e s to derive the control law the following relationship can be written to describe the motion in terms of point e 20 υ g ω r g e u v w t ϵ 0 q r t s υ a 0 v w t where υ a u q r t s 1 0 0 0 0 ϵ 0 ϵ 0 further let λ be a diagonal design matrix that is positive definite and pick the following input velocity command υ a d e s 21 υ a d e s s 1 r q t η e d e s λ η e d e s η e 0 v w t the closed loop dynamics are realized through substituting the input velocity command υ a υ a d e s in 20 using the resultant equation 20 after this substitution with the kinematic equation 19 gives us 22 η e r q r q t η e d e s λ η e d e s η e η e d e s λ η e d e s η e where the simplification is valid as a result of the orthogonal property of the rotation matrix i e r q r q t i the kinematic tracking error e implemented as shown in fig 3 and its dynamics e are now written based on 22 given by 23 e η e d e s η e 24 e λ e where the stability is a result of λ being positive definite as defined earlier 3 2 dynamic controller the second part of solving the trajectory tracking problem lies in the vehicle being able to realize the velocity commands that the kinematic controller produces this command is a function of the state of the vehicle the dynamic controller receives this velocity command which is now denoted as υ a d e s and tries to match the real velocity υ a with the kinematic controller output denoting the error between the two velocities as 25 e v υ a d e s υ a the dynamics of η e can then be described by substituting the input velocity command υ a υ a d e s e v in 20 using the resultant equation 20 after this substitution with the kinematic equation 19 gives us 26 η e r q s υ a d e s e v 0 v w t which leads to the following error dynamics 27 e λ e r q s e v the trajectory tracking error here does not necessarily converge to zero because of the existence of the r q s e v term in eq 27 to force the position error dynamics e to zero the mismatch between the command velocity and the vehicle velocity e v must be driven to zero recalling that the dynamics of the vehicle can be described by 28 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g q τ where ν u v w p q r t and τ is as defined in section 2 4 a reduced order model that only takes into consideration the controlled degrees of freedom is written as 29 m 3 3 υ a c υ a 3 3 υ a d υ a 3 3 υ a g q 3 1 d υ a 3 1 τ a in which υ a u q r t τ a x l m t and d υ a 3 1 is the disturbance vector that captures the effect of the nonlinear coupling between the 3 controlled degrees of freedom and those that are not controllable also m 3 3 c 3 3 and d 3 3 are only compromised of the components directly induced by υ a the dynamic controller now is required to produce a τ a that can track the velocity vector υ a d e s despite the disturbance vector d ν 3 1 given that υ a d e s and υ a d e s are available a computed torque like control law is defined as 30 τ a m 3 3 υ a d e s k d e ν c υ a 3 3 υ a d υ a 3 3 υ a g q 3 1 d υ a 3 1 in which k d is a positive definitive diagonal design matrix the dynamics of the error e v can now be found by taking the time derivative of 25 then finding υ a from 29 and substituting in it the control law in eq 30 gives us the following e v υ a d e s υ a m 3 3 1 c υ a 3 3 υ a d υ a 3 3 υ a g q 3 1 d υ a 3 1 m 3 3 1 τ a υ a d e s m 3 3 1 c υ a 3 3 υ a d υ a 3 3 υ a g q 3 1 d υ a 3 1 m 3 3 1 m 3 3 υ a d e s k d e ν c υ a 3 3 υ a d υ a 3 3 υ a g q 3 1 d υ a 3 1 υ a d e s 31 e v k d e v because k d is a positive definite design matrix we can choose the above implies exponential convergence of e v defined in 25 to zero and consequently from 27 we have that e converges to zero 3 3 adaptive control the performance of the previously devised controllers depends on the values of the diagonal elements in the positive definite matrices λ and k d further the performance of the dynamic inner control loop must keep up with the trajectory fed by the kinematic outer control loop in presence of noise and possible model uncertainty for robust trajectory tracking to occur consequently an adaptive strategy to tune the design parameter gains is proposed two approaches are presented an adaptive proportional control apc adaptation law that depends on the tracking error and an adaptation law based on universal adaptive stabilization uas at this point it is worth explicitly defining our kinematic and dynamic control gains λ k d explicitly as follows we let 32 λ d i a g k x 2 k y 2 k z 2 33 k d d i a g k x 2 k y 2 k z 2 the difference in performance are shown in the results later in the paper to come from the choices made in determining the above sets of gain parameters i e k x k y k z k x k y k z the details of this with each methodology i e apc and uas are provided below 3 3 1 adaptive proportional control the apc tunes the design parameters based on the propagation of a variable k i which depends on the error the dynamic adaptation law in each direction i x y z is given as 34 k i γ i e i 2 i x y z and e x e y e z t η e d e s η e where k i is the adapted design parameter γ i is a positive constant that controls the adaptation rate with respect to the tracking error e i i e e x e y e z t η e d e s η e the control law for the kinematic loop then is as before 35 η e η e d e s λ η e d e s η e and now additionally we have λ d i a g k x 2 k y 2 k z 2 theorem 1 let k x t 0 γ x 0 k y t 0 γ y 0 k z t 0 γ z 0 then for 35 η e η e d e s e 0 as t proof to prove the stability of the devised kinematic control law consider the candidate lyapunov function 36 v e μ 1 2 e t e μ t μ where μ k x k y k z t taking the time derivative of candidate lyapunov function yields 37 v e μ e t e μ t μ e t e μ t γ x e x 2 γ y e y 2 γ z e z 2 now using 23 24 we get e t λ e k x k y k z γ x e x 2 γ y e y 2 γ z e z 2 e t λ γ x k x 0 0 0 γ y k y 0 0 0 γ z k z e now from 32 e t k x k x γ x 0 0 0 k y k y γ y 0 0 0 k z k z γ z e 0 given that k i t 0 0 for all i x y z then 38 v 0 0 0 v e μ 0 e i k i 0 v e μ 0 e i k i 0 if k i γ i where knowing from 34 that k i is an increasing function then the condition k i γ i can be enforced by initializing k i to be larger than its respective γ i following lyapunov stability theory the system is asymptotically stable and the tracking error will converge to zero this completes the proof similarly the above procedure can be applied to the dynamic controller to ensure its stability as below for the case of the apc controller with respect to the dynamics the adaptation law for each direction is enumerated by ℓ x y z and is given as 39 k ℓ γ ℓ e ℓ 2 ℓ x y z and e x e y e z t e v e v x e v y e v z t where k ℓ is the adapted design parameter γ ℓ is a positive constant that controls the adaptation rate with respect to the dynamics tracking error e ℓ i e e x e y e z t e v e v x e v y e v z t note that the different enumeration for the case of the kinematic dynamic controller are simply chosen to show that the gains and respective initial conditions for the kinematics and dynamics controllers are different theorem 2 let k x t 0 γ x 0 k y t 0 γ y 0 k z t 0 γ z 0 then for 31 υ a υ a d e s e v 0 as t proof the proof is readily obtained by following the exact structure as in the proof of theorem 1 by replacing k x k y k z γ x γ y γ z with k x k y k z γ x γ y γ z respectively and considering the candidate lyapunov function v e v κ 1 2 e v t e v κ t κ where κ k x k y k z t 3 3 2 universal adaptive stabilization based control the controller must adapt to overcome the vehicle experiencing environmental disturbances like currents as well as any vehicle model parameter uncertainties consequently we devise a uas based adaptation law that is expected to adapt at a faster rate when compared with the apc the uas based adaptation law devised here relies on a nussbaum function to tune the design parameters hence we name it for convenience adaptive nussbaum control or anc which we use later to document results nussbaum functions are usually exploited in the design of universal adaptive stabilizers a mittag leffler function is chosen to act as a nussbaum function for the purpose of tuning the design parameters it is of interest to note that a mittag leffler function can act as a nussbaum function under certain conditions that are documented in li and chen 2009 so the new uas based kinematic control law takes the following form 40 η e η e d e s n μ η e d e s η e where μ k x k y k z t n μ d i a g n x k x n y k y n z k z and each n i k i i x y z is the mittag leffler function that depends on two positive real parameters α and β authors in li and chen 2009 find conditions under which the mittag leffler function acts as a nussbaum function i e if α 2 3 and β 1 the mittag leffler function is given as 41 n i z γ 0 z γ γ α γ β where α and β are the constant parameters and γ z 1 z γ z z 0 is the standard gamma function the time propagation of k i is defined just like in eq 34 as 42 k i γ i e i 2 based on the above the following results provides a proof of stability for the uas based gain adaptation scheme used for kinematic control theorem 3 let γ x γ y γ z all equal 1 if n μ d i a g n x k x n y k y n z k z where n i z where i x y z is as defined in 41 k i t k i t 0 and α 2 3 β 1 then η e η e d e s e 0 as t proof the stability of the uas approach is proved as follows rewriting equation 40 in terms of the tracking error for the x direction gives 43 e x n x k x e x 0 e x n x k x e x choose a function as 44 v x e x k x 1 2 e x 2 k x t 0 k x t n x σ d σ taking the time derivative of v yields 45 v x e x k x e x e x n x k x t k x t n x k x t e x 2 n x k x t γ x e x 2 because we are given γ x 1 we get 46 v x e x k x 0 integrating v x e x k x gives 47 v x t v x t 0 c where c is a constant of integration substituting 44 in 47 gives 48 1 2 e x 2 k x t 0 k x t n x σ d σ c v x t 0 dividing by k x t k x t 0 gives 49 1 2 e x 2 k x t k x t 0 c v x t 0 k x t k x t 0 1 k x t k x t 0 k x t 0 k x t n x σ d σ now if k x t as t then the r h s of eq 49 can take values approaching following the nature of nussbaum functions and this will violate 49 as k x t is defined in 42 to be positive since the positive nature of the l h s of 49 is violated by letting k x t then the assumption that k x t is false and k x t is therefore bounded however k x t being a non decreasing function by definition and k x t being bounded implies that k x t k x as t this further implies that k x t 0 as t i e e x 2 t 0 as t or e x t 0 as t the above steps can be repeated with k y k z and n k y n k z for obtaining the required results in all three directions thus the stability of the approach is concluded similarly the uas based controller stability can be proven for the dynamic control law by repeating the above formulation for the dynamic tracking errors e v and the dynamic controller gains κ for this recall that the error in dynamics is given by e v k d e v earlier the gain k d is tuned using apc but in the uas based approach we re write this as follows 50 e v υ a υ a d e s n κ e v κ k x k y k z t notice that the above simply corresponds to changing the term k d in 30 to n κ so executing the procedure as in 31 simply gives us 50 we now define n κ d i a g n x k x n y k y n z k z where as defined before the gain adaptations for k x k y k z are given as below 51 k ℓ γ ℓ e ℓ 2 ℓ x y z and e x e y e z t e v e v x e v y e v z t also note that when here we write n ℓ z we still mean that the definition of n is as given by 41 just that the enumeration in this case is with index ℓ x y z instead of i x y z based on the above we present the final result used in this paper this result deals with the error convergence of the uas based dynamics controller theorem 4 let γ x γ y γ z all 1 if n κ d i a g n x k x n y k y n z k z where n ℓ z where ℓ x y z is as defined in 41 k ℓ t k ℓ t 0 and α 2 3 β 1 then υ a υ a d e s e v 0 as t proof the required results can be obtained by following the same structure as in the proof for theorem 3 but replacing k x k y k z γ x γ y γ z with k x k y k z γ x γ y γ z respectively and then considering v x e v x k x 1 2 e v x 2 k x t 0 k x t n x σ d σ from the results derived above it can be seen that as the kinematic and dynamic errors e e v respectively approach zero the gains stop adapting and stabilize however any noise or disturbance may cause the gains to keep growing the conditional adaptation law developed in the next section deals with this phenomenon 3 4 conditional adaptation law it is of interest to describe the conditions under which the adaptive algorithms tune the controller parameters this is important because the devised adaptation is unidirectional so the gains only grow as a result of the adaptation if the gains are too large in magnitude oscillations due to large control effort might hinder the system from staying as close to the trajectory as possible moreover large gains translate to large control effort which has detrimental consequences on the endurance of the on board power source fig 5 presents the conditional adaptation algorithm and highlights the four possible paths that it can take the gains are left to adapt initially for a duration of t d 2 s which is labeled on fig 5 as path 1 this duration of 2 s was selected after trial and error in simulation now let us assume that the euclidean norm of the error between the path and trajectory is a zero mean randomly distributed gaussian variable e 2 n 0 σ e n this assumption is valid since the dynamics are deterministic in nature and that the measurements noise is usually gaussian in nature the standard deviation of the error norm is updated at each time step to describe the variance of the history of the error for the sake of computational performance it is of interest to implement a recursive mean and standard deviation algorithm to avoid processing the entire time history of the error vector at each time step the algorithm chosen was proposed by welford welford 1962 and it has since been thoroughly analyzed and observed to be stable and much less prone to loss of precision over alternative algorithms the euclidean or second norm of the error is shown in eq 52 52 e t 2 e x t 2 e y t 2 e z t 2 e n t further let the average value of the vector of error norms e n be described in a moving window of length l and let the standard deviation of the vector of error norms e n be that of the entire time history of e n 53 e n t i k l k e n t i l the proposed adaptation is set to happen when the current value of the error norm is more than 1 96 standard deviations away from the average value of the error norm as shown in eq 54 so path 2 in fig 5 represents the case when the value of the error norm is smaller than z d 1 96 54 if e n t σ e n t z d go to paths 3 or 4 as per fig 5 where σ e n t is the standard deviation of e n t the expression in eq 54 represents the normal score or the z score which is defined to be the number of standard deviations by which an observed variable exceeds the mean it is argued that if the computed z score grows to exceed 1 96 standard deviations from the mean it must be the case that a significant disturbance of some sort happened because such a high z score corresponds to slightly less than 95 of the recorded error values being expected to be within the range of 1 96 standard deviations in this case the gains are allowed to adapt as shown in path 3 this is done to mitigate the effects of the disturbance on control performance however if a disturbance happens such that the z score grows beyond the last maximum value of the normal score z m a x that is recorded in the initial gain update period of 2 s it must be the case that a major disturbance happened the suggested approach to effectively deal with these situations comes in the form of resetting the adapted controller gains as shown in path 4 resetting the gains serves to circumvent having unnecessary large gains for the controllers which translates to large control effort note that paths 1 2 3 in fig 5 loop back to the beginning of the conditional adaptation process whereas path 4 also goes through the restart clock block which resets the timing counts and restarts the gain adaptation process 4 results and discussion in order to evaluate the performance of the devised control algorithm the controller was tested in simulation environment under matlab four trajectories were used to evaluate the algorithms and the results validate the performance of the controller the trajectories ranged from straight lines connecting waypoints to quintic polynomials connecting waypoints to helical paths and to figure 8 shaped paths table 5 presents the coordinates used to parametrize the first straight and quintic polynomial paths the helical and figure 8 paths start and end at the same point the initial pose of the vehicle in all tests is an offset off the starting trajectory point in the y and z directions by 1 m gaussian white noise sequences were injected into the measurements fed into the controller the simulated noise is described by n μ 0 σ 0 01 m in addition to the injected measurement noise environmental effects like water currents were simulated this environmental disturbance was modeled to be a first order gauss markov process as in 55 τ c u r r e n t δ τ c u r r e n t ϵ where τ c u r r e n t x y z t are the current induced forces in the three principal directions δ is a time constant that determines how fast the current changes and ϵ is a vector of gaussian white noises that drives the system the injected disturbance is presented in fig 6 with δ 0 05 and ϵ n μ 0 σ 150 n the aforementioned disturbances were identical between all the test cases for brevity only the figure 8 test trajectory results with all controllers are detailed in figs 7 and 8 as seen from tables 8 and 9 anc outperforms apc so the figures shown further are only based on anc the trajectory tracking results of the anc with conditional adaptation for the other test trajectories are presented in figs 9 through 12 the figure 8 test trajectory was chosen to stress the advantages of the proposed algorithm as it involves sharp bends that force the adaptation to happen this type of trajectory is consequently one of the more difficult ones to track it is of interest to note that a mismatch in the final waypoint of path 3 and the first waypoint in path 4 was done to further stress the controller in the straight lines trajectory as presented in table 5 figs 7 and 8 provide the gains for kinematic adaptation gains for dynamic adaptation the error norm e n standard deviation of the error norm and the z score of the error norm the window size l used for calculating the average of the error norm corresponds to a 2 s window with samples taken at 200 hz it can be seen from figs 7 and 8 that the conditional adaptation routine consistently results in lower gains this is because in the cases of conditional adaptation in figs 7 and 8 the gain is observed to change corresponding to the changes in the z score this shows that the proposed conditional adaptation scheme is in operation and works well to limit the gains this further translates to overall less utilization of the thrusters and longer runtime for the vehicle as a result however this does come at the expense of a slightly higher threshold for error as seen from the tracking error norm and the statistical metrics plots the continuous adaptation has smoother plots as the gains keep growing to offset large errors the continuously adapting apc consistently fails throughout the tests as reported in tables 6 8 the reason for that is the sudden growth observed in the dynamic control gains which indicates an abnormally large mismatch in the dynamic error e v tables 6 and 11 summarize the tracking performance of the two proposed controllers and the two adaptation routines in the presence of noise as well as the lack thereof the mean absolute error the mean absolute control effort and the maximum absolute control effort are documented for the tested trajectories for both apc and uas based anc it is worth noting that tables 9 11 report results with the conditional adaptation scheme proposed which is why these tables are labeled as being for the conditional adaptation law tables 6 8 on the other hand display results where there is no check on adaptation and adaptation is simply allowed to continuously run with the continuous adaptation law the apc consistently fails in the simulated noisy environment and it sometimes fails in the noise free environment the controller here is never able to guide the vehicle to the trajectory as a consequence of the relatively slow adaptation on the other hand the anc exhibits more robustness to the level of noise present moreover when the apc does work it results in tracking error in the same order as the anc but the apc consistently requires larger control efforts than the anc even with the conditional adaptation law the maximum recorded effort clearly shows this shortcoming of the apc approach if the conditional adaptation is incorporated then the apc fails in less number of cases and the anc improves the control performance in terms of the effort required to track trajectories the results point to the anc being a capable solution to adapt the gains even without a conditional adaptation scheme the results also give merit to the use of the conditional adaptation over continuous adaptation such that the adapting gains reset to avoid overshoot and or instability 5 conclusions and future work the trajectory control task for survey class autonomous underwater vehicles operating in uncertain environments is tackled in this paper it is of interest for the vehicle to be robust to unforeseen disturbances in its working environment to that end high and low level controllers are synthesized to guide the vehicle to its set trajectory and stability of the controllers is proven a novel adaptation law tunes the gains of kinematic and dynamic controllers such that the marine craft can safely navigate its unknown environment and execute the task required of it the simulations point towards the favorability of the approach over other adaptation techniques namely a proportional adaptive controller when it comes to the required level of control effort the nussbaum based adaptation proved to be quick to tune the controller gains and as a consequence the controller does not expend more effort than necessary to guide the vehicle to towards its trajectory further the conditional adaptation scheme showed promise as a tool to govern gain adaptation this is also very important because these vehicles often employ onboard power sources that have to be used as efficiently as possible as a future effort the controllers are to be experimentally validated in a real setting to prove the effectiveness of the approach further variations on the gain tuning laws can be investigated for example rather than using the single integration driven system presented in eq 34 one could write the gain dynamics as a stable first order system for which the time constant needs investigation 
22511,this work describes an adaptive trajectory tracking controller for underactuated underwater vehicles the control design process is two fold first a high level kinematic controller is designed to produce velocity commands that steer the vehicle towards the desired trajectory and second a low level controller is designed to utilize the mathematical model of the vehicle to produce force and torque commands for the thrusters onboard the underwater vehicle a novel adaptive nussbaum function based controller is proposed and compared with an adaptive proportional controller with integral feedback further a conditional adaptation scheme is developed to combat effects of noise disturbance or uncertainty the proposed scheme governs adaptation such that the gains only adapt when it is necessary even in the presence of noise the target vehicle for the controller is a four thruster quadcopter like vehicle which does not have direct control over all degrees of freedom the issue of having an underactuated thruster arrangement is common in many classes of inspection robots the devised adaptive control law exhibits fast convergence for the adaptation four different parametrized trajectories are tested and the performance of the proposed algorithms when considering the tracking errors and required control effort is shown to be superior to an adaptive proportional controller keywords adaptive control underactuated underwater vehicle nussbaum function 1 introduction autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are types of marine craft that are deployed to execute surveillance and reconnaissance missions for the military inspection and identification tasks for the construction and oil and gas industries payload delivery assignments and search and salvage operations auvs are essential to the operation of many industries today button et al 2009 palomeras et al 2018 the auv control problem is a rather challenging one aneke 2003 aneke et al 2003 underwater vehicles present difficult control design problems because their dynamics are described using coupled nonlinear dynamic equations with six degrees of freedom thus a lot of effort is needed to acquire precise models for auvs also unpredictable disturbances that are present in an underwater environment in which such a vehicle operates are difficult to estimate du et al 2018 further a majority of auvs deployed in the field are underactuated in nature that is although the nature of the motion is kinematically admissible they have fewer actuators than degrees of freedom so motion to attain a certain position is dictated by the actuator arrangement used the motion control task can be a point to point motion problem where the system has to reach a final configuration from an initial configuration a path following problem where the system has to both reach a final configuration from an initial configuration and follow a geometric path or a trajectory following problem whereby the path following problem is associated with a timing law for reaching certain positions martin and whitcomb 2012 this work proposes a trajectory tracking controller for an underactuated underwater vehicle this is coupled with an adaptation law to enable robustness to external disturbance and deployability in unknown environments literature presents a multitude of approaches to tackle the control problem one of the simpler approaches to solving the control problem is line of sight los path following where the marine craft is required to move at a constant forward speed and a heading controller leads the marine craft to converge to the parametrized path fossen et al 2015 fossen and lekkas 2017 sliding mode control is used in literature to design controllers that are exponentially stable and capable of following trajectories in wadoo and kachroo 2016 the authors tackle the problem of designing control laws for a 4 thruster underactuated marine craft first the dynamics are transformed into chained form coordinates a kinematic control law is then devised for point to point motion as well as trajectory following tasks finally a dynamic control law which is also designed around the transformed coordinates is coupled with the kinematic control law to realize force and moment based control rather than velocity control the stability of the laws is investigated and proven in wadoo and kachroo 2016 another auv with 4 actuators is treated in watanabe et al 2013 where a second order chained form transformation is coupled with a discontinuous control method to attain a globally stable system this controller is verified through simulation in lim and jung 2013 an underactuated quadcopter system is stabilized in attitude using a time delayed controller which outperforms results achieved using a pid controller especially for disturbance rejection the control method is concerned with estimating the dynamic state of the system and providing compensation through control action adaptive control is treated in the literature in many works an adaptive lookahead distance los control law to guide autonomous underwater vehicles is proposed in fossen and lekkas 2017 also fossen et al 2015 adapts another los based approach to make the vehicle robust to disturbances in the form of unpredictable water current and rezazadegan et al 2015 proposes an adaptive backstepping approach to deal with parameter uncertainties when controlling auvs a hierarchical robust nonlinear controller is designed in karkoub et al 2017 to guide an underactuated auv subject to uncertainties in a trajectory the controller utilizes back stepping and sliding mode control techniques in a hierarchical structure that is based on the kinematic and dynamic models of the auv second order sliding mode control is exploited in the design of an adaptive path following controller in zhang et al 2018 the proposed adaptation affects the controller s damping ratio to eliminate the chattering phenomenon commonly observed in sliding mode control other recent works that address the control design problem include lapierre 2009 which focuses on robust diving as well as rezazadegan et al 2015 which studies simultaneous auv control and parameter estimation this work proposes a novel adaptive nussbaum function based controller to solve the trajectory tracking problem for an underactuated auv a conditional adaptation routine is also devised to manage the adaptation and the performance of the proposed approach is compared against an adaptive proportional controller the devised controllers aim to reduce the control effort necessary to guide underactuated auvs four parametrized trajectories are tested in simulation to validate the proposed approach the paper is organized as follows after the introduction the mathematical model for the underactuated vehicle is presented then the proposed high and low level controllers as well as the adaptive algorithms are derived and stability of the approaches is proven the proposed algorithms are then extensively tested in a simulated environment and quantitative monte carlo results are presented finally conclusions and avenues for future work are presented 2 vehicle mathematical model 2 1 vehicle design the vehicle prototype is shown in fig 1 where the cad model is rendered in a simulated environment to showcase the prototype the prototype

thruster allocation matrices are available in section 2 7 2 3 kinematic equations of motion the kinematic vehicle model describes the relationship between the body fixed coordinate frame and the earth fixed coordinate frame which we denote as the b frame and the n frame respectively these are shown in fig 2 here the n frame is one that presumes that auvs do not transverse large distances therefore

surge direction the kinematic model in eq 1 can then be rewritten as 6 p n q r q 1 3 0 1 3 0 4 3 1 2 t q u ω where r q 1 3 is the first row of r q which describes the relation between the surge motion in the b frame and the change in position in the n frame this gives rise to control problems as the sway and heave motions are not directly exploitable in control design 2 4 rigid body dynamics the newton euler equations of motion for a rigid body yield 7 m ν ω ν ω r g ω ω r g τ 1 i b ω ω i b ω m r g ν ω ν τ 2 where r g x g y g z g t is the center of gravity of the vehicle m is the mass of the vehicle i b is the 3 3 inertia matrix of the vehicle with respect to r g and τ τ 1 t τ 2 t t x y z k l m t is the generalized vector of external forces τ 1 and moments τ 2 applied on the vehicle following sname notation as in table 1 and ν u v w p q r t i e the velocities as per table 1 the rigid body dynamics can be factored into a rigid body mass matrix m r b and a coriolis and centrifugal forces matrix c r b which can be written in the following form 8 m r b ν c r b ν τ where 9 m r b m i 3 3 m s r g m s r g i b c r b 0 3 3 s m 11 υ m 12 ω s m 11 υ m 12 ω s m 12 t υ m 22 ω where m i j is one of the four 3 3 matrices forming m r b 2 5 hydrodynamics hydrodynamic effects on the vehicle are twofold they are added mass in addition to damping 2 5 1 hydrodynamic mass added mass is a fluid structure interaction phenomenon that affects the motion of solid structures in a fluid medium this interaction appears in the form of an additional force required to accelerate the body in the medium the interaction is governed by numerous criteria like the geometry of the moving body the orientation of the body the type and amount of fluid surrounding the body and the frequency of excitation of waves fackrell 2011 han and xu 1996 this phenomenon results in a change to the apparent mass of the vehicle that impedes the acceleration of the vehicle in the devised model the effect of added mass is accounted for as a change in the apparent mass matrix of the vehicle for a geometrically symmetric vehicle the added mass matrix is symmetric and is taken to be of the following form 10 m a x u x v x w x p x q x r y u y v y w y p y q y r z u z v z w z p z q z r k u k v k w k p k q k r m u m v m w m p m q m r n u n v n w n p n q n r where x w is a force in the x direction due to acceleration in the z direction k v is a moment around the x direction due to acceleration in the y direction and the same nomenclature follows for the rest of the forces and moments as per sname notation the notion of hydrodynamic mass introduces coriolis and centrifugal forces to the model which are accounted for by a matrix c a and this matrix takes the form of c r b in eq 9 except that m a i j replaces m r b i j the complete dynamic model accounting for all such effects is available in 15 2 5 2 hydrodynamic damping hydrodynamic damping represents the dissipative forces that can resist the motion of a marine craft which are lumped in the vector d ν d l d q ν where d l d q r 6 6 are the linear and quadratic damping matrices accounting for skin friction and quadratic drag fossen 2011 and the operator represents the hadamard product whereas by ν we mean the element wise absolute value of ν the matrix d ν is strictly positive 11 d ν 0 6 6 ν t d ν ν 0 ν 0 2 6 restoring forces and moments hydrostatic effects on the vehicle comprise the restoring forces matrix g q which describes gravitational forces f g as well as buoyant forces f b acting through and about the centers of gravity and buoyancy of the vehicle they can be represented in the b frame as 12 f g r q t 0 0 w f b r q t 0 0 b where w m g is the weight of the vehicle and b ρ g is the buoyancy force with ρ being the density of water and being the volume of the vehicle the restoring forces matrix is then 13 g q f g f b r g f g r b f b where r g and r b are the centers of gravity and buoyancy of the vehicle which are designed to be far apart in the vertical direction this gives the vehicle natural pitch and roll stability and eliminates the need to implement attitude control note that g q is written in terms of quaternions 2 7 actuation the external forces exerted on the vehicle are those arising from actuation through thrusters and those arising from the environmental currents control of the vehicle is achieved through thrusters which are modeled by the thruster allocation matrix actuation of each thruster results in a thrust force applied on the location of the thruster a moment of that force about the center of gravity of the vehicle and a reaction torque on the vehicle that is a result of the rotary motion of the propeller the rotational torque is neglected here because the vehicle has natural roll and pitch stability and the effect is negligible in comparison with the hydrodynamic forces the vehicle experiences the thruster allocation matrix maps the input signal of all the actuators to the resulting forces moments and torques on the vehicle and it is given by 14 τ i 1 i n f i i 1 i n r i f i 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 l l l l l l l l thruster allocation matrix f 1 f 2 f 3 f 4 where f i and r i f i are the force and moment generated by thruster i and n 4 is the number of thrusters installed here l is the perpendicular distance between any of the four thrusters and the center of gravity r g 2 8 dynamic equations of motion accounting for all the above effects the standard dynamic model in the b frame can be written as fossen 2011 15 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g q τ where m m r b m a c c r b c a and d ν d l d q ν all the vehicle model parameters in this section need to be identified for accurate simulation and control purposes 2 9 vehicle parameters the vehicle parameters used in all the simulations here are the ones we identified in wadi et al 2018 table 2 details the identified rigid body parameters of the vehicle table 3 describes the drag profile parameters of the vehicle and table 4 presents the added inertia parameters of the vehicle 3 controller design as a consequence of the underactuated nature of the underwater vehicle while the vehicle can reach any position in its configuration space it is constrained in the way that motion can happen submarines are examples of underactuated underwater vehicles because they are usually equipped with a thruster that propels the vehicle forward and two stern planes that introduce pitch and yaw moments similarly the auv can only generate thrust in the forward direction and moments about all axes this makes the control nontrivial and simpler control techniques like state feedback become inapplicable wadoo and kachroo 2016 consequently a subset of the degrees of freedom that can be actuated is exploited in a manner that allows the vehicle to accomplish the tasks required of it here trajectory tracking is the task we focus on for it is a common task that underwater vehicles are required to perform the control law proposed is an extension of control laws that are typically applied on underactuated wheeled robots thrun et al 2005 the authors in alonge et al 2001 propose the same law for an underactuated underwater vehicle but the controller tuning is done manually our work is novel with regards to the type of self tuning adaptation law proposed for use with auvs as well as in the tuning conditions algorithm the control architecture is presented in fig 3 3 1 kinematic controller based on the kinematic model derived in eq 1 it is of interest to devise a control law that exclusively makes use of the actuatable degrees of freedom in tracking a given trajectory first the position and velocity of point e in fig 4 is to be described where point e is a lookahead distance usually employed in line of sight path following algorithms in the inertial frame point e is described as 16 η e x e y e z e t υ e u e v e w e t with the velocities written in terms of the translational velocity υ g and rotational velocity ω of the vehicle as 17 υ e υ g ω r g e where the relative distance between points g and e is the distance ϵ along the x axis of the body frame of the vehicle 18 r g e ϵ 0 0 t in 18 ϵ is simply the constant distance from the center of gravity of the vehicle to the nose of the vehicle picking the point e allows us to write the dynamics in such a way so that the controller can be used to cancel some terms thus enabling a path to showing stability this is similar to feedback linearization of systems and such approaches are commonly used for ground robot waypoint navigation control al khatib et al 2015 to formulate the kinematic control law the kinematic model is first used to describe the velocities in eq 17 in the n frame as 19 η e r q υ g ω r g e q t q ω where υ g u 0 0 t and ω 0 q r t are inputs and the rest of the velocities are taken as disturbances the trajectory following problem is to design a control law that can force the vehicle whose position is described by 19 to follow the desired continuous trajectory described by some η e d e s η e d e s to derive the control law the following relationship can be written to describe the motion in terms of point e 20 υ g ω r g e u v w t ϵ 0 q r t s υ a 0 v w t where υ a u q r t s 1 0 0 0 0 ϵ 0 ϵ 0 further let λ be a diagonal design matrix that is positive definite and pick the following input velocity command υ a d e s 21 υ a d e s s 1 r q t η e d e s λ η e d e s η e 0 v w t the closed loop dynamics are realized through substituting the input velocity command υ a υ a d e s in 20 using the resultant equation 20 after this substitution with the kinematic equation 19 gives us 22 η e r q r q t η e d e s λ η e d e s η e η e d e s λ η e d e s η e where the simplification is valid as a result of the orthogonal property of the rotation matrix i e r q r q t i the kinematic tracking error e implemented as shown in fig 3 and its dynamics e are now written based on 22 given by 23 e η e d e s η e 24 e λ e where the stability is a result of λ being positive definite as defined earlier 3 2 dynamic controller the second part of solving the trajectory tracking problem lies in the vehicle being able to realize the velocity commands that the kinematic controller produces this command is a function of the state of the vehicle the dynamic controller receives this velocity command which is now denoted as υ a d e s and tries to match the real velocity υ a with the kinematic controller output denoting the error between the two velocities as 25 e v υ a d e s υ a the dynamics of η e can then be described by substituting the input velocity command υ a υ a d e s e v in 20 using the resultant equation 20 after this substitution with the kinematic equation 19 gives us 26 η e r q s υ a d e s e v 0 v w t which leads to the following error dynamics 27 e λ e r q s e v the trajectory tracking error here does not necessarily converge to zero because of the existence of the r q s e v term in eq 27 to force the position error dynamics e to zero the mismatch between the command velocity and the vehicle velocity e v must be driven to zero recalling that the dynamics of the vehicle can be described by 28 m ν c ν ν d ν ν g q τ where ν u v w p q r t and τ is as defined in section 2 4 a reduced order model that only takes into consideration the controlled degrees of freedom is written as 29 m 3 3 υ a c υ a 3 3 υ a d υ a 3 3 υ a g q 3 1 d υ a 3 1 τ a in which υ a u q r t τ a x l m t and d υ a 3 1 is the disturbance vector that captures the effect of the nonlinear coupling between the 3 controlled degrees of freedom and those that are not controllable also m 3 3 c 3 3 and d 3 3 are only compromised of the components directly induced by υ a the dynamic controller now is required to produce a τ a that can track the velocity vector υ a d e s despite the disturbance vector d ν 3 1 given that υ a d e s and υ a d e s are available a computed torque like control law is defined as 30 τ a m 3 3 υ a d e s k d e ν c υ a 3 3 υ a d υ a 3 3 υ a g q 3 1 d υ a 3 1 in which k d is a positive definitive diagonal design matrix the dynamics of the error e v can now be found by taking the time derivative of 25 then finding υ a from 29 and substituting in it the control law in eq 30 gives us the following e v υ a d e s υ a m 3 3 1 c υ a 3 3 υ a d υ a 3 3 υ a g q 3 1 d υ a 3 1 m 3 3 1 τ a υ a d e s m 3 3 1 c υ a 3 3 υ a d υ a 3 3 υ a g q 3 1 d υ a 3 1 m 3 3 1 m 3 3 υ a d e s k d e ν c υ a 3 3 υ a d υ a 3 3 υ a g q 3 1 d υ a 3 1 υ a d e s 31 e v k d e v because k d is a positive definite design matrix we can choose the above implies exponential convergence of e v defined in 25 to zero and consequently from 27 we have that e converges to zero 3 3 adaptive control the performance of the previously devised controllers depends on the values of the diagonal elements in the positive definite matrices λ and k d further the performance of the dynamic inner control loop must keep up with the trajectory fed by the kinematic outer control loop in presence of noise and possible model uncertainty for robust trajectory tracking to occur consequently an adaptive strategy to tune the design parameter gains is proposed two approaches are presented an adaptive proportional control apc adaptation law that depends on the tracking error and an adaptation law based on universal adaptive stabilization uas at this point it is worth explicitly defining our kinematic and dynamic control gains λ k d explicitly as follows we let 32 λ d i a g k x 2 k y 2 k z 2 33 k d d i a g k x 2 k y 2 k z 2 the difference in performance are shown in the results later in the paper to come from the choices made in determining the above sets of gain parameters i e k x k y k z k x k y k z the details of this with each methodology i e apc and uas are provided below 3 3 1 adaptive proportional control the apc tunes the design parameters based on the propagation of a variable k i which depends on the error the dynamic adaptation law in each direction i x y z is given as 34 k i γ i e i 2 i x y z and e x e y e z t η e d e s η e where k i is the adapted design parameter γ i is a positive constant that controls the adaptation rate with respect to the tracking error e i i e e x e y e z t η e d e s η e the control law for the kinematic loop then is as before 35 η e η e d e s λ η e d e s η e and now additionally we have λ d i a g k x 2 k y 2 k z 2 theorem 1 let k x t 0 γ x 0 k y t 0 γ y 0 k z t 0 γ z 0 then for 35 η e η e d e s e 0 as t proof to prove the stability of the devised kinematic control law consider the candidate lyapunov function 36 v e μ 1 2 e t e μ t μ where μ k x k y k z t taking the time derivative of candidate lyapunov function yields 37 v e μ e t e μ t μ e t e μ t γ x e x 2 γ y e y 2 γ z e z 2 now using 23 24 we get e t λ e k x k y k z γ x e x 2 γ y e y 2 γ z e z 2 e t λ γ x k x 0 0 0 γ y k y 0 0 0 γ z k z e now from 32 e t k x k x γ x 0 0 0 k y k y γ y 0 0 0 k z k z γ z e 0 given that k i t 0 0 for all i x y z then 38 v 0 0 0 v e μ 0 e i k i 0 v e μ 0 e i k i 0 if k i γ i where knowing from 34 that k i is an increasing function then the condition k i γ i can be enforced by initializing k i to be larger than its respective γ i following lyapunov stability theory the system is asymptotically stable and the tracking error will converge to zero this completes the proof similarly the above procedure can be applied to the dynamic controller to ensure its stability as below for the case of the apc controller with respect to the dynamics the adaptation law for each direction is enumerated by ℓ x y z and is given as 39 k ℓ γ ℓ e ℓ 2 ℓ x y z and e x e y e z t e v e v x e v y e v z t where k ℓ is the adapted design parameter γ ℓ is a positive constant that controls the adaptation rate with respect to the dynamics tracking error e ℓ i e e x e y e z t e v e v x e v y e v z t note that the different enumeration for the case of the kinematic dynamic controller are simply chosen to show that the gains and respective initial conditions for the kinematics and dynamics controllers are different theorem 2 let k x t 0 γ x 0 k y t 0 γ y 0 k z t 0 γ z 0 then for 31 υ a υ a d e s e v 0 as t proof the proof is readily obtained by following the exact structure as in the proof of theorem 1 by replacing k x k y k z γ x γ y γ z with k x k y k z γ x γ y γ z respectively and considering the candidate lyapunov function v e v κ 1 2 e v t e v κ t κ where κ k x k y k z t 3 3 2 universal adaptive stabilization based control the controller must adapt to overcome the vehicle experiencing environmental disturbances like currents as well as any vehicle model parameter uncertainties consequently we devise a uas based adaptation law that is expected to adapt at a faster rate when compared with the apc the uas based adaptation law devised here relies on a nussbaum function to tune the design parameters hence we name it for convenience adaptive nussbaum control or anc which we use later to document results nussbaum functions are usually exploited in the design of universal adaptive stabilizers a mittag leffler function is chosen to act as a nussbaum function for the purpose of tuning the design parameters it is of interest to note that a mittag leffler function can act as a nussbaum function under certain conditions that are documented in li and chen 2009 so the new uas based kinematic control law takes the following form 40 η e η e d e s n μ η e d e s η e where μ k x k y k z t n μ d i a g n x k x n y k y n z k z and each n i k i i x y z is the mittag leffler function that depends on two positive real parameters α and β authors in li and chen 2009 find conditions under which the mittag leffler function acts as a nussbaum function i e if α 2 3 and β 1 the mittag leffler function is given as 41 n i z γ 0 z γ γ α γ β where α and β are the constant parameters and γ z 1 z γ z z 0 is the standard gamma function the time propagation of k i is defined just like in eq 34 as 42 k i γ i e i 2 based on the above the following results provides a proof of stability for the uas based gain adaptation scheme used for kinematic control theorem 3 let γ x γ y γ z all equal 1 if n μ d i a g n x k x n y k y n z k z where n i z where i x y z is as defined in 41 k i t k i t 0 and α 2 3 β 1 then η e η e d e s e 0 as t proof the stability of the uas approach is proved as follows rewriting equation 40 in terms of the tracking error for the x direction gives 43 e x n x k x e x 0 e x n x k x e x choose a function as 44 v x e x k x 1 2 e x 2 k x t 0 k x t n x σ d σ taking the time derivative of v yields 45 v x e x k x e x e x n x k x t k x t n x k x t e x 2 n x k x t γ x e x 2 because we are given γ x 1 we get 46 v x e x k x 0 integrating v x e x k x gives 47 v x t v x t 0 c where c is a constant of integration substituting 44 in 47 gives 48 1 2 e x 2 k x t 0 k x t n x σ d σ c v x t 0 dividing by k x t k x t 0 gives 49 1 2 e x 2 k x t k x t 0 c v x t 0 k x t k x t 0 1 k x t k x t 0 k x t 0 k x t n x σ d σ now if k x t as t then the r h s of eq 49 can take values approaching following the nature of nussbaum functions and this will violate 49 as k x t is defined in 42 to be positive since the positive nature of the l h s of 49 is violated by letting k x t then the assumption that k x t is false and k x t is therefore bounded however k x t being a non decreasing function by definition and k x t being bounded implies that k x t k x as t this further implies that k x t 0 as t i e e x 2 t 0 as t or e x t 0 as t the above steps can be repeated with k y k z and n k y n k z for obtaining the required results in all three directions thus the stability of the approach is concluded similarly the uas based controller stability can be proven for the dynamic control law by repeating the above formulation for the dynamic tracking errors e v and the dynamic controller gains κ for this recall that the error in dynamics is given by e v k d e v earlier the gain k d is tuned using apc but in the uas based approach we re write this as follows 50 e v υ a υ a d e s n κ e v κ k x k y k z t notice that the above simply corresponds to changing the term k d in 30 to n κ so executing the procedure as in 31 simply gives us 50 we now define n κ d i a g n x k x n y k y n z k z where as defined before the gain adaptations for k x k y k z are given as below 51 k ℓ γ ℓ e ℓ 2 ℓ x y z and e x e y e z t e v e v x e v y e v z t also note that when here we write n ℓ z we still mean that the definition of n is as given by 41 just that the enumeration in this case is with index ℓ x y z instead of i x y z based on the above we present the final result used in this paper this result deals with the error convergence of the uas based dynamics controller theorem 4 let γ x γ y γ z all 1 if n κ d i a g n x k x n y k y n z k z where n ℓ z where ℓ x y z is as defined in 41 k ℓ t k ℓ t 0 and α 2 3 β 1 then υ a υ a d e s e v 0 as t proof the required results can be obtained by following the same structure as in the proof for theorem 3 but replacing k x k y k z γ x γ y γ z with k x k y k z γ x γ y γ z respectively and then considering v x e v x k x 1 2 e v x 2 k x t 0 k x t n x σ d σ from the results derived above it can be seen that as the kinematic and dynamic errors e e v respectively approach zero the gains stop adapting and stabilize however any noise or disturbance may cause the gains to keep growing the conditional adaptation law developed in the next section deals with this phenomenon 3 4 conditional adaptation law it is of interest to describe the conditions under which the adaptive algorithms tune the controller parameters this is important because the devised adaptation is unidirectional so the gains only grow as a result of the adaptation if the gains are too large in magnitude oscillations due to large control effort might hinder the system from staying as close to the trajectory as possible moreover large gains translate to large control effort which has detrimental consequences on the endurance of the on board power source fig 5 presents the conditional adaptation algorithm and highlights the four possible paths that it can take the gains are left to adapt initially for a duration of t d 2 s which is labeled on fig 5 as path 1 this duration of 2 s was selected after trial and error in simulation now let us assume that the euclidean norm of the error between the path and trajectory is a zero mean randomly distributed gaussian variable e 2 n 0 σ e n this assumption is valid since the dynamics are deterministic in nature and that the measurements noise is usually gaussian in nature the standard deviation of the error norm is updated at each time step to describe the variance of the history of the error for the sake of computational performance it is of interest to implement a recursive mean and standard deviation algorithm to avoid processing the entire time history of the error vector at each time step the algorithm chosen was proposed by welford welford 1962 and it has since been thoroughly analyzed and observed to be stable and much less prone to loss of precision over alternative algorithms the euclidean or second norm of the error is shown in eq 52 52 e t 2 e x t 2 e y t 2 e z t 2 e n t further let the average value of the vector of error norms e n be described in a moving window of length l and let the standard deviation of the vector of error norms e n be that of the entire time history of e n 53 e n t i k l k e n t i l the proposed adaptation is set to happen when the current value of the error norm is more than 1 96 standard deviations away from the average value of the error norm as shown in eq 54 so path 2 in fig 5 represents the case when the value of the error norm is smaller than z d 1 96 54 if e n t σ e n t z d go to paths 3 or 4 as per fig 5 where σ e n t is the standard deviation of e n t the expression in eq 54 represents the normal score or the z score which is defined to be the number of standard deviations by which an observed variable exceeds the mean it is argued that if the computed z score grows to exceed 1 96 standard deviations from the mean it must be the case that a significant disturbance of some sort happened because such a high z score corresponds to slightly less than 95 of the recorded error values being expected to be within the range of 1 96 standard deviations in this case the gains are allowed to adapt as shown in path 3 this is done to mitigate the effects of the disturbance on control performance however if a disturbance happens such that the z score grows beyond the last maximum value of the normal score z m a x that is recorded in the initial gain update period of 2 s it must be the case that a major disturbance happened the suggested approach to effectively deal with these situations comes in the form of resetting the adapted controller gains as shown in path 4 resetting the gains serves to circumvent having unnecessary large gains for the controllers which translates to large control effort note that paths 1 2 3 in fig 5 loop back to the beginning of the conditional adaptation process whereas path 4 also goes through the restart clock block which resets the timing counts and restarts the gain adaptation process 4 results and discussion in order to evaluate the performance of the devised control algorithm the controller was tested in simulation environment under matlab four trajectories were used to evaluate the algorithms and the results validate the performance of the controller the trajectories ranged from straight lines connecting waypoints to quintic polynomials connecting waypoints to helical paths and to figure 8 shaped paths table 5 presents the coordinates used to parametrize the first straight and quintic polynomial paths the helical and figure 8 paths start and end at the same point the initial pose of the vehicle in all tests is an offset off the starting trajectory point in the y and z directions by 1 m gaussian white noise sequences were injected into the measurements fed into the controller the simulated noise is described by n μ 0 σ 0 01 m in addition to the injected measurement noise environmental effects like water currents were simulated this environmental disturbance was modeled to be a first order gauss markov process as in 55 τ c u r r e n t δ τ c u r r e n t ϵ where τ c u r r e n t x y z t are the current induced forces in the three principal directions δ is a time constant that determines how fast the current changes and ϵ is a vector of gaussian white noises that drives the system the injected disturbance is presented in fig 6 with δ 0 05 and ϵ n μ 0 σ 150 n the aforementioned disturbances were identical between all the test cases for brevity only the figure 8 test trajectory results with all controllers are detailed in figs 7 and 8 as seen from tables 8 and 9 anc outperforms apc so the figures shown further are only based on anc the trajectory tracking results of the anc with conditional adaptation for the other test trajectories are presented in figs 9 through 12 the figure 8 test trajectory was chosen to stress the advantages of the proposed algorithm as it involves sharp bends that force the adaptation to happen this type of trajectory is consequently one of the more difficult ones to track it is of interest to note that a mismatch in the final waypoint of path 3 and the first waypoint in path 4 was done to further stress the controller in the straight lines trajectory as presented in table 5 figs 7 and 8 provide the gains for kinematic adaptation gains for dynamic adaptation the error norm e n standard deviation of the error norm and the z score of the error norm the window size l used for calculating the average of the error norm corresponds to a 2 s window with samples taken at 200 hz it can be seen from figs 7 and 8 that the conditional adaptation routine consistently results in lower gains this is because in the cases of conditional adaptation in figs 7 and 8 the gain is observed to change corresponding to the changes in the z score this shows that the proposed conditional adaptation scheme is in operation and works well to limit the gains this further translates to overall less utilization of the thrusters and longer runtime for the vehicle as a result however this does come at the expense of a slightly higher threshold for error as seen from the tracking error norm and the statistical metrics plots the continuous adaptation has smoother plots as the gains keep growing to offset large errors the continuously adapting apc consistently fails throughout the tests as reported in tables 6 8 the reason for that is the sudden growth observed in the dynamic control gains which indicates an abnormally large mismatch in the dynamic error e v tables 6 and 11 summarize the tracking performance of the two proposed controllers and the two adaptation routines in the presence of noise as well as the lack thereof the mean absolute error the mean absolute control effort and the maximum absolute control effort are documented for the tested trajectories for both apc and uas based anc it is worth noting that tables 9 11 report results with the conditional adaptation scheme proposed which is why these tables are labeled as being for the conditional adaptation law tables 6 8 on the other hand display results where there is no check on adaptation and adaptation is simply allowed to continuously run with the continuous adaptation law the apc consistently fails in the simulated noisy environment and it sometimes fails in the noise free environment the controller here is never able to guide the vehicle to the trajectory as a consequence of the relatively slow adaptation on the other hand the anc exhibits more robustness to the level of noise present moreover when the apc does work it results in tracking error in the same order as the anc but the apc consistently requires larger control efforts than the anc even with the conditional adaptation law the maximum recorded effort clearly shows this shortcoming of the apc approach if the conditional adaptation is incorporated then the apc fails in less number of cases and the anc improves the control performance in terms of the effort required to track trajectories the results point to the anc being a capable solution to adapt the gains even without a conditional adaptation scheme the results also give merit to the use of the conditional adaptation over continuous adaptation such that the adapting gains reset to avoid overshoot and or instability 5 conclusions and future work the trajectory control task for survey class autonomous underwater vehicles operating in uncertain environments is tackled in this paper it is of interest for the vehicle to be robust to unforeseen disturbances in its working environment to that end high and low level controllers are synthesized to guide the vehicle to its set trajectory and stability of the controllers is proven a novel adaptation law tunes the gains of kinematic and dynamic controllers such that the marine craft can safely navigate its unknown environment and execute the task required of it the simulations point towards the favorability of the approach over other adaptation techniques namely a proportional adaptive controller when it comes to the required level of control effort the nussbaum based adaptation proved to be quick to tune the controller gains and as a consequence the controller does not expend more effort than necessary to guide the vehicle to towards its trajectory further the conditional adaptation scheme showed promise as a tool to govern gain adaptation this is also very important because these vehicles often employ onboard power sources that have to be used as efficiently as possible as a future effort the controllers are to be experimentally validated in a real setting to prove the effectiveness of the approach further variations on the gain tuning laws can be investigated for example rather than using the single integration driven system presented in eq 34 one could write the gain dynamics as a stable first order system for which the time constant needs investigation 
22512,the performance of a porous screen placed in the center of a rectangular tank has been investigated based on an analytical numerical and experimental approach for the lateral excitation of the tank the two dimensional potential model was solved analytically with the galerkin method by adding the frictional damping coefficient at the free surface condition and considering the energy dissipation across the porous screen the comparison of the analytical solution with the experimental results shows a good agreement for the frictional damping coefficient of 0 3 the main physical parameters are the surface elevation pressure at the tank walls including hydrodynamic forces on the wall and the horizontal load on the porous screen for different submergence depths and porosities that were investigated the presence of screen shifts the sloshing tank natural periods slightly especially in the lowest mode the unrevealed phenomena accompanied with linear potential theory the nonlinear wave profile and screen associated effects were also investigated based on an experimental and numerical method the results show that the numerical prediction with star ccm was in good agreement with the experimental results up to second harmonics it was found that the porous slotted screen can be an effective device for the suppression of sloshing motion if properly designed keywords sloshing slotted screen galerkin method resonance incompressible turbulent model experiments 1 introduction in passive sloshing dampers screens or perforated plates are efficient devices for suppressing the extreme hydrodynamic forces and moments that can occur due to resonantly forced sloshing the perforated screens can be classified based on the size of the perforation which is defined either based on the solidity ratio s n which is the ratio of solid area to the full area of the screen or porosity p 1 s n the application of low s n less than 0 5 can be seen in tuned liquid dampers tld installed in tall buildings an important requirement in tlds is matching the lowest resonant frequency of the liquid in the tank with the natural frequency of the interest of the structure faltinsen and timokha 2009 love and tait 2010 in contrast swash bulkhead in the liquid cargo tanks of ship with a high solidity ratio s n 0 5 are mainly used to push the lowest natural frequency of sloshing to a higher frequency range where the wave excitation velocities and accelerations are less severe some initial attempts made by abramson et al 1962a 1963 abramson and chu 1962 garza 1964 abramson and garza 1964 1965 and abramson 1965 1969 were based on the analytical and experimental methods for the forced horizontal excitation of a vertical circular tank with perforated sectors of different sizes and various open area percentages their studies clearly show that the perforated sectors with a larger solidity ratio shifted the lowest sloshing resonant frequency to a higher frequency range despite small excitation amplitude for larger excitation amplitude for the tank strong nonlinear effects were noticed dodge 2000 experimentally demonstrated that the perforations of vertical baffles reduced the slosh dynamics and a change in its natural frequency occurred when the solidity ratio exceeded 0 9 the liquid flow through screens is associated with the wave run up free surface nonlinearities flow separation jet flow and liquid fragmentation are commonly observed phenomena that have been researched for several years laws and livesey 1978 presented a clear review of flow through gauze screens and discussed its important properties based on experimental analytical and numerical methods the pressure drop across the screen depended on the undisturbed velocity gauze area reflection and deflection coefficients the pressure drop across the screen was described by a quadratic drag law with a head loss coefficient and a screen averaged inertial coefficient and the same has been used by bennett et al 1992 mei et al 1974 and molin 2010 faltinsen and timokha 2011 presented mathematical formulations based on linear potential theory using the domain decomposition method for anti symmetric natural sloshing modes in a sloshing tank with a slotted screen at the center the quantification was based on the number of screen slots position of the slots and solidity ratio the results for a small excitation amplitude showed satisfactory agreement with the experimental values and differences have been attributed to nonlinear effects due to cross flow at the screen there have been several studies following faltinsen and timokha 2011 such as faltinsen et al 2011a modified the pressure drop condition over a mean submerged screen by accounting for the exponential decay in the velocity profile to improve the predicted linear natural frequencies and the definition of potential functions where the anti symmetric sloshing modes in the clean tank without a screen were assumed to be unaffected by the screen but responsible for cross flow through the screen this resulted in a better estimate compared with that of faltinsen and timokha 2011 for the flow damping at the screen with the theory and closer agreement with the experimental results of the resonance peak frequencies for a lower solidity ratio and low amplitude of excitation large discrepancy at the resonance peak frequencies for higher solidity ratios was also noticed to overcome the discrepancy a quasi linear multimodal theory was introduced based on the natural sloshing modes by faltinsen et al 2011b the method accounts for the screen geometry with local flow separation through the pressure drop boundary condition for very small amplitudes of excitation 0 001 m the results show good agreement with the experiments and were not good for higher amplitudes 0 01 m and 0 02 m complex phenomena of wave breaking of the free surface due to the existence of secondary resonance effects were documented by authors in the form of photographs faltinsen et al 2011c devised a nonlinear free surface using adaptive nonlinear modal theory with the inclusion of screen effects the modified adaptive nonlinear modal theory shows its ability to predict and capture the new resonant points associated with secondary resonance in reference to the boundary condition across the screen some of the authors addressed this based on darcy s law see yu 1995 chwang and wu 1994 wu et al 2013 cho and kim 2008 liu and lin 2009 cho and kim 2016 cho et al 2017 darcy s law suggested that the velocity of fluid passing through the porous plate with relatively fine pores is linearly proportional to the pressure drop by using a complex valued frequency dependent parameter which accounts for both viscous and inertial effects wave diffraction by a single slotted barrier was solved using non linear flow conditions across the screen by developing equivalent linear screen averaged conditions where both inertial and quadratic drag effects were included by crowley and porter 2012a this was envisaged and extended to analytic solutions to the n vertical porous screens by crowley and porter 2012b molin and remy 2013 also carried out the experimental and numerical study of the sloshing motion in a rectangular tank with a single perforated screen which was fully extended to the tank bottom the main difference between crowley and porter 2012a and molin and remy 2013 is that crowley and porter 2012a used the screen depth averaged drag coefficient whereas in molin and remy s formulation the drag coefficient was varied with the screen s depth cho and kim 2016 and cho et al 2017 used similar formulations to obtain the pressure drop across the screen the analytical solution based on crowley and porter s methodology for the liquid sloshing with dual vertical porous baffles located at 1 3 and 2 3 of the tank s length for arbitrary submergence depths in a horizontal excitation motion was investigated by cho and kim 2016 reasonable agreement between the developed quasi linear analytical solution and the experimental results is shown but there were significant differences in the peak magnitudes which has been attributed to both the nonlinear free surface and viscous effects cho et al 2017 investigated the horizontal porous screen with the matched eigenfunction expansion method meem the energy dissipation across the screen was addressed based on darcy s law with the porous effect parameter obtained from a series of experiments with various ranges of porosity from 0 05 to 0 4 cho and kim 2008 to address the singularity problem associated with the tip of the slotted edges porter and evans 1995 used singular integral equations to capture local asymptotics by considering both the horizontal velocity of the fluid and jump in pressure drop based on the galerkin method they applied to this the number of problems involving thin vertical barriers with gaps by using the linear theory of water waves in a finite depth however their study was restricted to a screen with a single opening later authors used similar formulations by extending them to multiple gaps see faltinsen and timokha 2011 based on a non orthogonal set of functions in the present paper the analytical solution is developed based on the methodology by crowley and porter 2012a and molin and remy 2013 for considering the viscous effect at the porous screen a comprehensive review of the appropriate computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for liquid sloshing with a slotted screen was conducted by maravani and hamed 2011 their numerical algorithm was developed based on the laminar navier stokes ns solver using the finite difference method and partial cell treatment was used to model the screen firoozkoohi 2013 used an open source cfd package openfoam that employs laminar ns equations based on the finite volume method in a rectangular tank equipped with a slotted screen the above papers with cfd models were restricted to laminar flow analysis major contributions of the turbulence generated effects at the screen were not taken into account and they were unable to obtain the steady state solution for the coarse slat slot arrangements in the present study numerical simulations based on an incompressible turbulent model using the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation was adopted to solve the sloshing problem for a swaying rectangular tank with a slotted screen in the present paper analytical numerical and experimental studies are employed to solve sloshing in a porous screen equipped tank the developed analytical method is based on the linear potential flow for a two dimensional 2d rectangular tank with a slotted screen the methodology by crowley and porter 2012a and molin and remy 2013 is adopted to indicate the energy dissipation and continuity of the horizontal velocity at the screen to account for the presence of the slotted screen the galerkin method of porter and evans 1995 is used to expand the jump in velocity potential across the slotted screen in a set of basis functions including the complete polynomials of chebyshev then the square root of singularity at the lower edge of the slotted screen is correctly modeled for quantitative and qualitative comparison with the developed analytical tool the numerical method based on the incompressible turbulent model along with the experiments are investigated to mainly understand the complex phenomena associated with the slotted screen 2 analytic solution we investigated the two dimensional sloshing liquid motion in a rectangular tank of length 2 a with a vertical slotted screen at x 0 cartesian axes were chosen with the x axis along the mean free surface and z axis pointing vertically upward as shown in fig 1 the water depth is denoted by h and the submergence depth of the slotted screen is denoted by d the tank was forced to oscillate horizontally with amplitude ξ and frequency ω it was assumed that the fluid was incompressible and inviscid and the wave motions were small so linear potential theory could be used the fluid particle velocity can then be described by the gradient of a velocity potential φ x z t which satisfy the laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 with the following free surface bottom and tank wall boundary conditions 2 φ z 1 g 2 φ t 2 ε φ t 0 on z 0 3 φ z 0 on z h 4 φ x ω ξ cos ω t on x a where g is the gravitational acceleration eq 2 is the modified free surface boundary condition for considering the wave energy dissipated by the frictional damping at the wall and bottom of the tank where ε is called to the rayleigh damping coefficient faltinsen and timokha 2009 the additional boundary conditions are required to relate the flows on both sides of porous screen the approximate boundary conditions at porous screen were derived by bennett et al 1992 mei et al 1974 and cho and kim 2016 5 φ x z t x 0 0 0 on x 0 h z 0 6 φ x z t t 0 0 α 2 u r z t u r z t 2 c u r z t t on d z 0 0 on h z d where the square brackets denote the jump in the enclosed quantity u r z t φ x ω ξ cos ω t is the horizontal velocity of the fluid relative to that of the swaying tank and α and c are empirically determined coefficients α is the drag coefficient related to the energy dissipation across the porous screen c represents an inertial or blockage coefficient accounting for the added inertia felt by the fluid as it accelerates assuming harmonic motion of frequency ω the velocity potential wave elevation and horizontal relative flow velocity at porous screen can be written as 7 φ x z t re ω ξ ϕ x z e i ω t ζ x t re η x e i ω t u r z t re ω ξ u r z e i ω t it is clear that the sloshing oscillations in a rectangular tank will be anti symmetric due to the asymmetric swaying motion of the tank such that ϕ x z ϕ x z therefore we only needed to consider the fluid motion in the half tank in x 0 the boundary value problem was solved only on the left half plane x 0 and the solution in x 0 could be easily extended by the anti symmetric relation ϕ x z ϕ x z the quadratic velocity dependence in the boundary condition 6 implies that a sway tank motion with a single frequency ω introduces multi frequency responses of fluid thus expanding φ in a fourier time series in multiples of ω and retaining just the fundamental frequency response the fourier coefficient of first term is 8 3π whilst the next term at frequency 3ω is much smaller than ω and justifies this assumption transforms eq 6 using 7 into following porous boundary condition with c 0 if substituting eq 7 into eqs 1 6 the velocity potential ϕ x z satisfied the following boundary value problem 8 2 ϕ 0 9 ϕ z k ϕ 0 k ω 2 i ω ε g on z 0 10 ϕ z 0 on z h a x 0 11 ϕ x 1 on x a h z 0 12 ϕ x 0 z ϕ x 0 z on

with a sharp edged orifice as 14 α 1 p c c 1 2 where p is the porosity of the screen and c c is the discharge coefficient the empirical form of c c for the slotted screen is given by tait et al 2005 15 c c 0 405 e π p 1 0 595 the velocity potential satisfying eqs 8 10 can be written as follows 16 ϕ x z n 0 1 k n a n e k n x b n e k n x a f n z the eigenfunctions f n z must satisfy the following stürm liouville eigenvalue problem 17 d 2 f d z 2 κ 2 f 0 h z 0 d f d z k f 0 o n z 0 d f d z 0 o n z h the eigenfunctions can be written as 18 f n z cos k n z h cos k n h n 0 1 2 the complex

solved by using the newton raphson iteration method the initial values were determined from the case of ε 0 the eigenfunctions f n z were complete on the interval h 0 therefore satisfying the following orthogonal relation 20 h 0 f m z f n z d z n n δ m n where n n 1 cos 2 k n h h 2 sin 2 k n h 4 k n and δ m n is the kronecker delta function defined by δ m n 1 if m n and δ m n 0 if m n from

jump in velocity potential at the porous screen as 26 ϕ 0 z ϕ 0 z p 0 a p χ p z on d z 0 0 on h z d where a p p 0 1 2 are unknown expansion coefficients and χ p z is given by 27 χ ˆ p z χ p z k d z χ

the square root singularity at the lower edge of the porous screen after substituting eq 25 into eq 26 and then multiplying both sides of the resulting equation by f m z m 0 1 2 and integrating with

cosh k n x f n z by substituting eq 29 into eq 13 and then multiplying both sides of the resulting equation by χ m z and integrating with respect to z we obtained the following algebraic equations by

were carried out to validate the developed analytical solution in section 2 and identify and study the resonance frequencies in a rectangular tank with a slotted screen for different porosities and screen submergence depths the rectangular tank was composed of acrylic material with the inner dimensions 50 cm 10 cm 50 cm length width height and 1 2 cm thickness the width of the tank was small compared with the length of the tank to avoid any three dimensional sloshing effects the forced horizontal motion was given by using a cam mechanism comprised of a rotating disk and connecting arm see fig 2 the motion amplitude of the tank was controlled by positioning the end of a connecting arm at the appropriate place in a slot of a rotating disk with diameter 20 cm the tank was mounted on a movable platform supported over a frictionless lm guide installed in a fixed platform which allowed it to move only in the horizontal direction the complete experimental set up is shown in fig 2 the slotted screens were composed of acrylic material with 0 2 cm thickness where the slots were horizontal rectangles with a constant height along the tank width for the experiments two opening gaps of s g 0 2 cm and 0 4 cm combined with three different center to center spacings s c 2 cm 1 cm and 1 3 cm were used to give three different porosities p 0 0964 0 1968 and 0 3022 respectively to measure the wave elevation at the tank wall an image processing technique was used the accuracy of the measured wave elevation depended on the quality of video recorded the basic two parameters that may affect the quality of the video image are frame rate fps and pixels high accuracy can be achieved by using a high specification video recording camera but it also increases the computational processing time therefore it is necessary to select proper equipment to find a suitable balance between accuracy and computational time for the present study a camera with 1280 720 resolution and 240fps was used matlab was used for the image processing to improve optical detection the water was dyed red the dynamic pressure acting on the tank wall was measured with a water tight pressure gauge p310 02s the sampling frequency was 100 hz the pressure gauge was installed in the right side wall 2 cm away from the tank bottom 4 numerical model the numerical simulations of sloshing tank equipped with a porous slotted screen were also performed based on the finite volume method some complex flow phenomena associated with the slotted screen such as the wave run up wave breaking flow separation jet flow and nonlinear free surface were quantified along with the laboratory test results in the present study cfd software star ccm from cd adapco has been used a tank fixed coordinate system oxz was considered where x was aligned with the direction of the mean still water level and the z axis pointed vertically upward the same as the model size of the tank the numerical computational domain was also chosen by imposing a no slip condition on the walls tank s forced horizontal motion was recognized by a field function whose velocity was given by ω ξ cos ω t the fluid was assumed to be incompressible since it was expected that viscous and turbulence effects would play an important role across the screen two equations based on the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate were used to solve the transport equations with a realizable k ε turbulence model the free surface of the sloshing tank was captured using the volume of fluid vof method for the two fluid phases air and water a field function was used to initialize the vof all the computations were performed on an intel core i7 7700 cpu 3 6 ghz computer with 16 gb ram the fluid domain was discretized using a surface remesher and trimmed mesher with local mesh refinement around the free surface and two prism layers near the wall and screen were created for the overall tank the base size of 0 01 m was used see fig 3 the mesh spacings within the free surface zone 0 005 m and 0 0025 m were used in the x and z directions a prism layer of 0 005 m thickness was taken to capture the viscous effects the recommended y value should be less than five and in the present case it was over three a convergence study was carried out before reaching the final cell size a segregated iterative solver was used in which the momentum equations the pressure correction equation and the equation for the volume fraction of water were solved in turn the process was repeated several times within each time step the number of iterations per time step was set to 20 such that all of the residuals leveled out an automatic convective courant friedrichs lewy cfl time step control was used to ensure an adequate time step throughout the simulations the under relaxation factors used in this study were retained as default settings for the pressure 0 2 velocities 0 8 and volume fraction of water 0 9 a second order time integration scheme was used where the target mean and maximum cfl numbers 0 3 and 0 5 were used respectively this implies that the free surface should not move by more than 50 of the cell size in any direction 5 results and discussion 5 1 analytical results table 1 demonstrates the high accuracy and rapid convergence of the present galerkin solution for a porous slotted screen in a swaying rectangular tank the non dimensional added mass μ μ 2 ρ a h and radiation damping ν ν 2 ω ρ a h shown in eq 33 for a h 4 0 d h 0 5 p 0 1 ε 0 3 at different values of m are listed in table 1 it can be seen that for two different non dimensional frequencies ω 2 h g 0 5 and 1 0 the convergence of the solution was very rapid results with five decimal accuracy could be generally obtained using the truncating number of m 5 the high accuracy of the present solution was due to the fact that the nature of the square root singularity near the edge of the porous screen was correctly modeled we note that results up to five decimal accuracy are presented to show the rapid convergence of the solution one may adopt a less truncated number m to obtain results with three or four decimal accuracy initially the comparison for a sloshing tank without a screen will be demonstrated and compared with the experimental results fig 4 shows the wave elevation and dynamic pressure at the tank wall as a function of the tank motion s period the wave elevation is plotted in the normalized form given by the wave elevation amplitude at the tank wall to the tank s motion amplitude r a η max η min 2 ξ and the pressure is the peak to trough difference at z 0 8 h for ε 0 and 0 3 the solid and dotted line represents the present analytical solution for two frictional damping coefficients ε 0 and 0 3 along with the experimental results except the peak periods the analytical solution agrees well with the experimental results for both the amplification factor and pressure for a wide range of periods taken from 0 35s to 1 4s the analytical solution predicts two peaks very close to the theoretical lowest resonance frequencies which are explained by eq 36 ibrahim 2005 the natural frequencies ω n for sloshing modes n 1 2 3 in a rectangular tank can be computed based on the length of the tank 2a and water depth h as 36 ω n n π g 2 a tanh n π h 2 a n 1 2 3 the first three lowest natural frequencies for a rectangular tank without a screen are expected to occur at 5 86 rad s 1 07s 10 24 rad s 0 61s and 13 29 rad s 0 47s it is shown that the estimated resonance periods of lowest resonance modes based on the present linear potential theory are very close to the natural periods obtained by eq 36 but these are not the same in the case of nonlinear fluid sloshing or tanks equipped with screens baffles akyildiz and ünal 2005 in the experimental results due to nonlinearities the resonance frequencies of the sloshing tank are slightly different from the natural frequencies computed from the above equation at the resonance periods the amplification factor and pressure at the tank wall showed a big difference between the analytical and experimental results for ε 0 whereas they were reasonably good for ε 0 3 these differences at the peak periods can be attributed to the nonlinear sloshing wave and viscous effects which were not captured properly by the present potential theory for the rest of the work the frictional damping value 0 3 obtained from best matching with experimental results was used unless specified otherwise figs 5 and 6 show the amplification factor and dynamic pressure in a sloshing tank equipped with a slotted screen with different porosities p 0 0964 0 1968 and 0 3022 with halfway submergence d h 0 5 the sloshing tank equipped with a half submerged screen had similar tendency to the tank without a screen but recorded low amplification factor values at the tank wall which could be due to the free fluid movement at the lower part of the screen regardless of the porosity of the slotted screen two resonance periods occurred at 0 54s and 1 1s which was similar to the sloshing tank without a screen the former was the third lowest and the latter was the first lowest sloshing frequencies for the tank without a screen the lowest values of the amplification factor were noticed for the screen with p 0 1968 compared with the other porosities the obtained resonance periods shifted slightly to higher values than 0 47s and 1 07s given by eq 36 this shift can be attributed to the diffraction effects of the slotted screen a similar tendency was noticed in the experiments which also affirmed the nonlinear wave and turbulent effects especially near the resonance see figs 5 and 6 similar findings have been reported by faltinsen and timokha 2011 when the amplification factor and pressure were compared between the analytical and experimental results for the range of frequencies the difference in the amplitude and shift in peak periods seemed to be high in the case of the sloshing tank with a low porosity screen p 0 0964 and showed a significant discrepancy in the resonant periods it seems that the screen with low porosity resembled a rigid screen where the sloshing tank could be considered a smaller tank with a as the length of the tank however for other cases the discrepancy was greatly reduced when compared with experimental results the differences shown in the sloshing tank equipped with the screen were also associated with many violent phenomena across the screen that are not been properly accounted for in the present potential flow theory the above discussion can be further verified and justified by the numerical method fig 7 shows the amplification factor r a at the tank wall and normalized horizontal force by ρ g d ξ on a porous screen p 0 1 as a function of the submergence depth d h 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 and non dimensional frequencies ω 2 h g for a h 4 0 and ε 0 3 the five lowest non dimensional natural frequencies ω n 2 h g n 1 2 3 4 5 for the tank without a screen with a h 4 were 0 1467 0 5151 0 9741 1 4407 and 1 8876 correspondingly in the case of the tank without a screen the resonances occurred at the non dimensional natural frequencies of n 1 3 and 5 with a minimal contribution at the second and fourth modes in the non dimensional frequency range the lowest first mode had the lowest peak amplitude compared with the third and fifth modes by introducing the screen for different submergence depths the peak amplitudes were reduced due to the energy dissipation at the slotted screen the higher the submergence depths of the screen the lower the estimated amplification factor at the tank wall for various submergence depths the third mode peak locations changed noticeably compared with the first and fifth modes fig 7 b shows that sloshing induced horizontal forces on a porous screen generally had a similar tendency to the amplification factor measured at the tank wall see fig 7 a the horizontal forces see fig 7 b showed considerable variation in the range of 0 2 ω 2 h g 1 2 as the submergence depth increased the pressure difference across the porous screen became larger as a result larger horizontal forces were experienced at the higher submergence depths but this tendency was reversed after ω 2 h g 1 2 the variation in non dimensional added mass μ μ 2 ρ g h and the radiation damping coefficient ν ν 2 ω ρ g h for d h 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 with the same conditions as those in fig 7 are given in fig 8 at the first and third resonant frequencies ω 2 h g 0 14 and 0 96 the non dimensional added mass which was in phase with the acceleration of the tank reached a negative value and the damping coefficient which was in phase with the velocity of the tank reached its maximum value this unique phenomenon occurs in problems when the oscillating body excites the local hydrodynamic resonance of the enclosed fluid region in its vicinity fig 9 shows the trend of amplification factors with changing screen porosity p 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 for fixed values of d h 0 5 a h 4 0 and ε 0 3 the first third and fifth modes of non dimensional frequency seemed to be predominantly seen with peak amplitudes for the tank without and with a screen for various porosities when the peak amplitudes were compared among these three modes the first mode recorded a lower value a significant change in the location of the peak amplitude was noticeable only at the third mode the amplification factor at the fifth mode was greatly reduced as the porosity increased for the screen with porosity 0 1 the amplification factor was reduced greatly when compared with the other porosities a similar tendency to amplification factor was noticed for the horizontal force for different porosities see fig 9 b the reduction in the horizontal force with the increase of porosity was mainly due to the pressure difference across the screen 5 2 numerical results numerical simulations based on an incompressible turbulent model using the finite volume method were conducted to test the nonlinear and violent free surface effects in the presence of a slotted screen in the center of the tank for this purpose a typical period close to the peak period in which the analytical solution showed a significant difference with the experimental data was chosen for calculation the screen with p 0 0964 and p 0 3022 d h 0 5 in the motion period 0 5s which was close to the lowest resonance frequency of the tank without a screen was taken the analytical methology developed in the present study is based on quasi linear potential flow theory which generally gives the leading order solutions of the first harmonic that will be present whereas the numerical and experimental results are in the time domain which includes all the nonlinear higher harmonics therefore it would be convenient to decompose such a nonlinear time series into first harmonic and higher harmonic components and compare these with the analytical solution this will help us assess the optimum accuracy that can be achieved with the numerical solution when compared with the analytical solution the curve fitting tool with the fourier option in matlab has been employed in the present study the time series data was specified as arguments to the curve fitting tool cftool function the accuracy of the fitted curve can be examined based on the goodness of fit statistics and confidence intervals on the fitted coefficients fig 10 a and b shows the time history computed in the numerical simulation together with the experimental results for screen d h 0 5 with p 0 0964 and 0 3022 and respective harmonics in the form of the wave elevation at tank wall normalized by the tank s sway amplitude in fig 10 a the left plot comprises a top full time history recorded for the screen with p 0 0964 and in the bottom a closer look at the same time history from 20s to 30s is shown as well as the closer view alone for p 0 3022 in fig 10 b the recorded data for the experiment was taken for approximately 300s and the last 30s steady cycles were used for analysis the results show that the prediction of the numerical simulations is in good agreement with the experimental values up to second harmonics poorer comparison for the third and higher harmonics with the experimental results could be due to chosen spatial resolution this needs furthermore elaborate calculation to affirm the statement the screen with d h 0 5 with the lowest porosity 0 0964 was associated with the strong vortex at the bottom tip of the screen where the fluid moved freely under the lower part of the screen this vortex that formed at the bottom tip of the screen swayed back and forth close to the screen where the disturbance from the vortex was carried to the end of the tank along with the fluid motion and made the solution unsteady for several cycles see fig 10 c the wave run up and nonlinear wave profile were captured well at the screen by the present numerical simulations in accordance with the experimental results see fig 10 c the variations in the added mass and radiation damping coefficient were also obtained numerically based on the total force acting on the sloshing tank wall using the fourier series and these were compared with the analytical solution the total force time history f t n u m t could be transformed to the frequency domain characterized by frequency and mean displacement thus it was possible by taking the cosine and sine part of the fourier series evaluated at the fundamental frequency for comparison two sway amplitudes 0 001 m and 0 01 m were chosen the respective non dimensional added mass and radiation damping coefficient for a h 4 0 p 0 1 d h 0 6 are shown in fig 11 for small amplitude the predicted numerical simulations show good agreement with the analytical solution see fig 11 a in the case of higher sway amplitude the results were reasonably good as shown in fig 11 b it should be noted that the fourier series is sensitive to the duration of the time signal therefore in the present study proper care has been taken by choosing a long time signal for all the frequencies ω 2 h g 6 conclusions the analytical solution following a methodology similar to that of crowley and porter 2012a and molin and remy 2013 based on the linear potential flow model was developed and applied to a rectangular tank with a porous slotted screen installed at the center the present analytical approach adopts the quadratic drag law combining the energy dissipation and continuity of horizontal fluid velocity across the porous screen the analytical solution is based on the galerkin method in which the jump in the velocity potential of both sides of the porous screen is expanded by basis functions including the polynomial of chebyshev then the square root singularity at the lower edge of the screen is satisfied the results are presented as the amplification factor and dynamic pressure at the tank wall except the peak periods the analytical solution agrees well with the experimental results for both the amplification factor and pressure for a wide range of periods reasonably good agreement with the experimental data was achieved for a frictional damping coefficient ε 0 3 the differences in the analytical and experimental results have been attributed to the nonlinear effects which were verified and quantified using numerical simulations based on the incompressible turbulent model the accuracy of the presented numerical results shows good agreement up to the second harmonics with the experimental data the hydrodynamic coefficients added mass radiation damping coefficient were also obtained by taking the fourier series of the numerical solution and compared with the analytical solution the results were in good agreement for the case of low sway amplitude and acceptable for high sway amplitude finally a parametric study based on different porosities and submergence depths of the screen was carried out for a h 4 0 the estimated horizontal force on the porous screen increased with the increase in the submergence depth but the tendency was reversed after ω 2 h g 1 2 the lowest values of the amplification factor were shown at the screen with porosity p 0 1 for a submergence depth of d h 0 5 when compared with the other porosities the adopted numerical simulations and experimental results show the inadequacy of the present analytical method in revealing the important nonlinear phenomenon across the screen even though the numerical simulations are capable of supplying more elaborate results cfd simulations are computationally expensive for a parametric study the present paper provides a synergetic approach of analytical numerical and experimental analysis for better estimation of the physical parameters of the sloshing tank in the presence of a slotted screen acknowledgment this research was supported by the basic science research program through the

22512,the performance of a porous screen placed in the center of a rectangular tank has been investigated based on an analytical numerical and experimental approach for the lateral excitation of the tank the two dimensional potential model was solved analytically with the galerkin method by adding the frictional damping coefficient at the free surface condition and considering the energy dissipation across the porous screen the comparison of the analytical solution with the experimental results shows a good agreement for the frictional damping coefficient of 0 3 the main physical parameters are the surface elevation pressure at the tank walls including hydrodynamic forces on the wall and the horizontal load on the porous screen for different submergence depths and porosities that were investigated the presence of screen shifts the sloshing tank natural periods slightly especially in the lowest mode the unrevealed phenomena accompanied with linear potential theory the nonlinear wave profile and screen associated effects were also investigated based on an experimental and numerical method the results show that the numerical prediction with star ccm was in good agreement with the experimental results up to second harmonics it was found that the porous slotted screen can be an effective device for the suppression of sloshing motion if properly designed keywords sloshing slotted screen galerkin method resonance incompressible turbulent model experiments 1 introduction in passive sloshing dampers screens or perforated plates are efficient devices for suppressing the extreme hydrodynamic forces and moments that can occur due to resonantly forced sloshing the perforated screens can be classified based on the size of the perforation which is defined either based on the solidity ratio s n which is the ratio of solid area to the full area of the screen or porosity p 1 s n the application of low s n less than 0 5 can be seen in tuned liquid dampers tld installed in tall buildings an important requirement in tlds is matching the lowest resonant frequency of the liquid in the tank with the natural frequency of the interest of the structure faltinsen and timokha 2009 love and tait 2010 in contrast swash bulkhead in the liquid cargo tanks of ship with a high solidity ratio s n 0 5 are mainly used to push the lowest natural frequency of sloshing to a higher frequency range where the wave excitation velocities and accelerations are less severe some initial attempts made by abramson et al 1962a 1963 abramson and chu 1962 garza 1964 abramson and garza 1964 1965 and abramson 1965 1969 were based on the analytical and experimental methods for the forced horizontal excitation of a vertical circular tank with perforated sectors of different sizes and various open area percentages their studies clearly show that the perforated sectors with a larger solidity ratio shifted the lowest sloshing resonant frequency to a higher frequency range despite small excitation amplitude for larger excitation amplitude for the tank strong nonlinear effects were noticed dodge 2000 experimentally demonstrated that the perforations of vertical baffles reduced the slosh dynamics and a change in its natural frequency occurred when the solidity ratio exceeded 0 9 the liquid flow through screens is associated with the wave run up free surface nonlinearities flow separation jet flow and liquid fragmentation are commonly observed phenomena that have been researched for several years laws and livesey 1978 presented a clear review of flow through gauze screens and discussed its important properties based on experimental analytical and numerical methods the pressure drop across the screen depended on the undisturbed velocity gauze area reflection and deflection coefficients the pressure drop across the screen was described by a quadratic drag law with a head loss coefficient and a screen averaged inertial coefficient and the same has been used by bennett et al 1992 mei et al 1974 and molin 2010 faltinsen and timokha 2011 presented mathematical formulations based on linear potential theory using the domain decomposition method for anti symmetric natural sloshing modes in a sloshing tank with a slotted screen at the center the quantification was based on the number of screen slots position of the slots and solidity ratio the results for a small excitation amplitude showed satisfactory agreement with the experimental values and differences have been attributed to nonlinear effects due to cross flow at the screen there have been several studies following faltinsen and timokha 2011 such as faltinsen et al 2011a modified the pressure drop condition over a mean submerged screen by accounting for the exponential decay in the velocity profile to improve the predicted linear natural frequencies and the definition of potential functions where the anti symmetric sloshing modes in the clean tank without a screen were assumed to be unaffected by the screen but responsible for cross flow through the screen this resulted in a better estimate compared with that of faltinsen and timokha 2011 for the flow damping at the screen with the theory and closer agreement with the experimental results of the resonance peak frequencies for a lower solidity ratio and low amplitude of excitation large discrepancy at the resonance peak frequencies for higher solidity ratios was also noticed to overcome the discrepancy a quasi linear multimodal theory was introduced based on the natural sloshing modes by faltinsen et al 2011b the method accounts for the screen geometry with local flow separation through the pressure drop boundary condition for very small amplitudes of excitation 0 001 m the results show good agreement with the experiments and were not good for higher amplitudes 0 01 m and 0 02 m complex phenomena of wave breaking of the free surface due to the existence of secondary resonance effects were documented by authors in the form of photographs faltinsen et al 2011c devised a nonlinear free surface using adaptive nonlinear modal theory with the inclusion of screen effects the modified adaptive nonlinear modal theory shows its ability to predict and capture the new resonant points associated with secondary resonance in reference to the boundary condition across the screen some of the authors addressed this based on darcy s law see yu 1995 chwang and wu 1994 wu et al 2013 cho and kim 2008 liu and lin 2009 cho and kim 2016 cho et al 2017 darcy s law suggested that the velocity of fluid passing through the porous plate with relatively fine pores is linearly proportional to the pressure drop by using a complex valued frequency dependent parameter which accounts for both viscous and inertial effects wave diffraction by a single slotted barrier was solved using non linear flow conditions across the screen by developing equivalent linear screen averaged conditions where both inertial and quadratic drag effects were included by crowley and porter 2012a this was envisaged and extended to analytic solutions to the n vertical porous screens by crowley and porter 2012b molin and remy 2013 also carried out the experimental and numerical study of the sloshing motion in a rectangular tank with a single perforated screen which was fully extended to the tank bottom the main difference between crowley and porter 2012a and molin and remy 2013 is that crowley and porter 2012a used the screen depth averaged drag coefficient whereas in molin and remy s formulation the drag coefficient was varied with the screen s depth cho and kim 2016 and cho et al 2017 used similar formulations to obtain the pressure drop across the screen the analytical solution based on crowley and porter s methodology for the liquid sloshing with dual vertical porous baffles located at 1 3 and 2 3 of the tank s length for arbitrary submergence depths in a horizontal excitation motion was investigated by cho and kim 2016 reasonable agreement between the developed quasi linear analytical solution and the experimental results is shown but there were significant differences in the peak magnitudes which has been attributed to both the nonlinear free surface and viscous effects cho et al 2017 investigated the horizontal porous screen with the matched eigenfunction expansion method meem the energy dissipation across the screen was addressed based on darcy s law with the porous effect parameter obtained from a series of experiments with various ranges of porosity from 0 05 to 0 4 cho and kim 2008 to address the singularity problem associated with the tip of the slotted edges porter and evans 1995 used singular integral equations to capture local asymptotics by considering both the horizontal velocity of the fluid and jump in pressure drop based on the galerkin method they applied to this the number of problems involving thin vertical barriers with gaps by using the linear theory of water waves in a finite depth however their study was restricted to a screen with a single opening later authors used similar formulations by extending them to multiple gaps see faltinsen and timokha 2011 based on a non orthogonal set of functions in the present paper the analytical solution is developed based on the methodology by crowley and porter 2012a and molin and remy 2013 for considering the viscous effect at the porous screen a comprehensive review of the appropriate computational fluid dynamics cfd methods for liquid sloshing with a slotted screen was conducted by maravani and hamed 2011 their numerical algorithm was developed based on the laminar navier stokes ns solver using the finite difference method and partial cell treatment was used to model the screen firoozkoohi 2013 used an open source cfd package openfoam that employs laminar ns equations based on the finite volume method in a rectangular tank equipped with a slotted screen the above papers with cfd models were restricted to laminar flow analysis major contributions of the turbulence generated effects at the screen were not taken into account and they were unable to obtain the steady state solution for the coarse slat slot arrangements in the present study numerical simulations based on an incompressible turbulent model using the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equation was adopted to solve the sloshing problem for a swaying rectangular tank with a slotted screen in the present paper analytical numerical and experimental studies are employed to solve sloshing in a porous screen equipped tank the developed analytical method is based on the linear potential flow for a two dimensional 2d rectangular tank with a slotted screen the methodology by crowley and porter 2012a and molin and remy 2013 is adopted to indicate the energy dissipation and continuity of the horizontal velocity at the screen to account for the presence of the slotted screen the galerkin method of porter and evans 1995 is used to expand the jump in velocity potential across the slotted screen in a set of basis functions including the complete polynomials of chebyshev then the square root of singularity at the lower edge of the slotted screen is correctly modeled for quantitative and qualitative comparison with the developed analytical tool the numerical method based on the incompressible turbulent model along with the experiments are investigated to mainly understand the complex phenomena associated with the slotted screen 2 analytic solution we investigated the two dimensional sloshing liquid motion in a rectangular tank of length 2 a with a vertical slotted screen at x 0 cartesian axes were chosen with the x axis along the mean free surface and z axis pointing vertically upward as shown in fig 1 the water depth is denoted by h and the submergence depth of the slotted screen is denoted by d the tank was forced to oscillate horizontally with amplitude ξ and frequency ω it was assumed that the fluid was incompressible and inviscid and the wave motions were small so linear potential theory could be used the fluid particle velocity can then be described by the gradient of a velocity potential φ x z t which satisfy the laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 with the following free surface bottom and tank wall boundary conditions 2 φ z 1 g 2 φ t 2 ε φ t 0 on z 0 3 φ z 0 on z h 4 φ x ω ξ cos ω t on x a where g is the gravitational acceleration eq 2 is the modified free surface boundary condition for considering the wave energy dissipated by the frictional damping at the wall and bottom of the tank where ε is called to the rayleigh damping coefficient faltinsen and timokha 2009 the additional boundary conditions are required to relate the flows on both sides of porous screen the approximate boundary conditions at porous screen were derived by bennett et al 1992 mei et al 1974 and cho and kim 2016 5 φ x z t x 0 0 0 on x 0 h z 0 6 φ x z t t 0 0 α 2 u r z t u r z t 2 c u r z t t on d z 0 0 on h z d where the square brackets denote the jump in the enclosed quantity u r z t φ x ω ξ cos ω t is the horizontal velocity of the fluid relative to that of the swaying tank and α and c are empirically determined coefficients α is the drag coefficient related to the energy dissipation across the porous screen c represents an inertial or blockage coefficient accounting for the added inertia felt by the fluid as it accelerates assuming harmonic motion of frequency ω the velocity potential wave elevation and horizontal relative flow velocity at porous screen can be written as 7 φ x z t re ω ξ ϕ x z e i ω t ζ x t re η x e i ω t u r z t re ω ξ u r z e i ω t it is clear that the sloshing oscillations in a rectangular tank will be anti symmetric due to the asymmetric swaying motion of the tank such that ϕ x z ϕ x z therefore we only needed to consider the fluid motion in the half tank in x 0 the boundary value problem was solved only on the left half plane x 0 and the solution in x 0 could be easily extended by the anti symmetric relation ϕ x z ϕ x z the quadratic velocity dependence in the boundary condition 6 implies that a sway tank motion with a single frequency ω introduces multi frequency responses of fluid thus expanding φ in a fourier time series in multiples of ω and retaining just the fundamental frequency response the fourier coefficient of first term is 8 3π whilst the next term at frequency 3ω is much smaller than ω and justifies this assumption transforms eq 6 using 7 into following porous boundary condition with c 0 if substituting eq 7 into eqs 1 6 the velocity potential ϕ x z satisfied the following boundary value problem 8 2 ϕ 0 9 ϕ z k ϕ 0 k ω 2 i ω ε g on z 0 10 ϕ z 0 on z h a x 0 11 ϕ x 1 on x a h z 0 12 ϕ x 0 z ϕ x 0 z on

with a sharp edged orifice as 14 α 1 p c c 1 2 where p is the porosity of the screen and c c is the discharge coefficient the empirical form of c c for the slotted screen is given by tait et al 2005 15 c c 0 405 e π p 1 0 595 the velocity potential satisfying eqs 8 10 can be written as follows 16 ϕ x z n 0 1 k n a n e k n x b n e k n x a f n z the eigenfunctions f n z must satisfy the following stürm liouville eigenvalue problem 17 d 2 f d z 2 κ 2 f 0 h z 0 d f d z k f 0 o n z 0 d f d z 0 o n z h the eigenfunctions can be written as 18 f n z cos k n z h cos k n h n 0 1 2 the complex

solved by using the newton raphson iteration method the initial values were determined from the case of ε 0 the eigenfunctions f n z were complete on the interval h 0 therefore satisfying the following orthogonal relation 20 h 0 f m z f n z d z n n δ m n where n n 1 cos 2 k n h h 2 sin 2 k n h 4 k n and δ m n is the kronecker delta function defined by δ m n 1 if m n and δ m n 0 if m n from

jump in velocity potential at the porous screen as 26 ϕ 0 z ϕ 0 z p 0 a p χ p z on d z 0 0 on h z d where a p p 0 1 2 are unknown expansion coefficients and χ p z is given by 27 χ ˆ p z χ p z k d z χ

the square root singularity at the lower edge of the porous screen after substituting eq 25 into eq 26 and then multiplying both sides of the resulting equation by f m z m 0 1 2 and integrating with

were carried out to validate the developed analytical solution in section 2 and identify and study the resonance frequencies in a rectangular tank with a slotted screen for different porosities and screen submergence depths the rectangular tank was composed of acrylic material with the inner dimensions 50 cm 10 cm 50 cm length width height and 1 2 cm thickness the width of the tank was small compared with the length of the tank to avoid any three dimensional sloshing effects the forced horizontal motion was given by using a cam mechanism comprised of a rotating disk and connecting arm see fig 2 the motion amplitude of the tank was controlled by positioning the end of a connecting arm at the appropriate place in a slot of a rotating disk with diameter 20 cm the tank was mounted on a movable platform supported over a frictionless lm guide installed in a fixed platform which allowed it to move only in the horizontal direction the complete experimental set up is shown in fig 2 the slotted screens were composed of acrylic material with 0 2 cm thickness where the slots were horizontal rectangles with a constant height along the tank width for the experiments two opening gaps of s g 0 2 cm and 0 4 cm combined with three different center to center spacings s c 2 cm 1 cm and 1 3 cm were used to give three different porosities p 0 0964 0 1968 and 0 3022 respectively to measure the wave elevation at the tank wall an image processing technique was used the accuracy of the measured wave elevation depended on the quality of video recorded the basic two parameters that may affect the quality of the video image are frame rate fps and pixels high accuracy can be achieved by using a high specification video recording camera but it also increases the computational processing time therefore it is necessary to select proper equipment to find a suitable balance between accuracy and computational time for the present study a camera with 1280 720 resolution and 240fps was used matlab was used for the image processing to improve optical detection the water was dyed red the dynamic pressure acting on the tank wall was measured with a water tight pressure gauge p310 02s the sampling frequency was 100 hz the pressure gauge was installed in the right side wall 2 cm away from the tank bottom 4 numerical model the numerical simulations of sloshing tank equipped with a porous slotted screen were also performed based on the finite volume method some complex flow phenomena associated with the slotted screen such as the wave run up wave breaking flow separation jet flow and nonlinear free surface were quantified along with the laboratory test results in the present study cfd software star ccm from cd adapco has been used a tank fixed coordinate system oxz was considered where x was aligned with the direction of the mean still water level and the z axis pointed vertically upward the same as the model size of the tank the numerical computational domain was also chosen by imposing a no slip condition on the walls tank s forced horizontal motion was recognized by a field function whose velocity was given by ω ξ cos ω t the fluid was assumed to be incompressible since it was expected that viscous and turbulence effects would play an important role across the screen two equations based on the turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate were used to solve the transport equations with a realizable k ε turbulence model the free surface of the sloshing tank was captured using the volume of fluid vof method for the two fluid phases air and water a field function was used to initialize the vof all the computations were performed on an intel core i7 7700 cpu 3 6 ghz computer with 16 gb ram the fluid domain was discretized using a surface remesher and trimmed mesher with local mesh refinement around the free surface and two prism layers near the wall and screen were created for the overall tank the base size of 0 01 m was used see fig 3 the mesh spacings within the free surface zone 0 005 m and 0 0025 m were used in the x and z directions a prism layer of 0 005 m thickness was taken to capture the viscous effects the recommended y value should be less than five and in the present case it was over three a convergence study was carried out before reaching the final cell size a segregated iterative solver was used in which the momentum equations the pressure correction equation and the equation for the volume fraction of water were solved in turn the process was repeated several times within each time step the number of iterations per time step was set to 20 such that all of the residuals leveled out an automatic convective courant friedrichs lewy cfl time step control was used to ensure an adequate time step throughout the simulations the under relaxation factors used in this study were retained as default settings for the pressure 0 2 velocities 0 8 and volume fraction of water 0 9 a second order time integration scheme was used where the target mean and maximum cfl numbers 0 3 and 0 5 were used respectively this implies that the free surface should not move by more than 50 of the cell size in any direction 5 results and discussion 5 1 analytical results table 1 demonstrates the high accuracy and rapid convergence of the present galerkin solution for a porous slotted screen in a swaying rectangular tank the non dimensional added mass μ μ 2 ρ a h and radiation damping ν ν 2 ω ρ a h shown in eq 33 for a h 4 0 d h 0 5 p 0 1 ε 0 3 at different values of m are listed in table 1 it can be seen that for two different non dimensional frequencies ω 2 h g 0 5 and 1 0 the convergence of the solution was very rapid results with five decimal accuracy could be generally obtained using the truncating number of m 5 the high accuracy of the present solution was due to the fact that the nature of the square root singularity near the edge of the porous screen was correctly modeled we note that results up to five decimal accuracy are presented to show the rapid convergence of the solution one may adopt a less truncated number m to obtain results with three or four decimal accuracy initially the comparison for a sloshing tank without a screen will be demonstrated and compared with the experimental results fig 4 shows the wave elevation and dynamic pressure at the tank wall as a function of the tank motion s

trough difference at z 0 8 h for ε 0 and 0 3 the solid and dotted line represents the present analytical solution for two frictional damping coefficients ε 0 and 0 3 along with the experimental results except the peak periods the analytical solution agrees well with the experimental results for both the amplification factor and pressure for a wide range of periods taken from 0 35s to 1 4s the analytical solution predicts two peaks very close to the theoretical lowest resonance frequencies which are explained by eq 36 ibrahim 2005 the natural frequencies ω n for sloshing modes n 1 2 3 in a rectangular tank can be computed based on the length of the tank 2a and water depth h as 36 ω n n π g 2 a tanh n π h 2 a n 1 2 3 the first three lowest natural frequencies for a rectangular tank without a screen are expected to occur at 5 86 rad s 1 07s 10 24 rad s 0 61s and 13 29 rad s 0 47s it is shown that the estimated resonance periods of lowest resonance modes based on the present linear potential theory are very close to the natural periods obtained by eq 36 but these are not the same in the case of nonlinear fluid sloshing or tanks equipped with screens baffles akyildiz and ünal 2005 in the experimental results due to nonlinearities the resonance frequencies of the sloshing tank are slightly different from the natural frequencies computed from the above equation at the resonance periods the amplification factor and pressure at the tank wall showed a big difference between the analytical and experimental results for ε 0 whereas they were reasonably good for ε 0 3 these differences at the peak periods can be attributed to the nonlinear sloshing wave and viscous effects which were not captured properly by the present potential theory for the rest of the work the frictional damping value 0 3 obtained from best matching with experimental results was used unless specified otherwise figs 5 and 6 show the amplification factor and dynamic pressure in a sloshing tank equipped with a slotted screen with different porosities p 0 0964 0 1968 and 0 3022 with halfway submergence d h 0 5 the sloshing tank equipped with a half submerged screen had similar tendency to the tank without a screen but recorded low amplification factor values at the tank wall which could be due to the free fluid movement at the lower part of the screen regardless of the porosity of the slotted screen two resonance periods occurred at 0 54s and 1 1s which was similar to the sloshing tank without a screen the former was the third lowest and the latter was the first lowest sloshing frequencies for the tank without a screen the lowest values of the amplification factor were noticed for the screen with p 0 1968 compared with the other porosities the obtained resonance periods shifted slightly to higher values than 0 47s and 1 07s given by eq 36 this shift can be attributed to the diffraction effects of the slotted screen a similar tendency was noticed in the experiments which also affirmed the nonlinear wave and turbulent effects especially near the resonance see figs 5 and 6 similar findings have been reported by faltinsen and timokha 2011 when the amplification factor and pressure were compared between the analytical and experimental results for the range of frequencies the difference in the amplitude and shift in peak periods seemed to be high in the case of the sloshing tank with a low porosity screen p 0 0964 and showed a significant discrepancy in the resonant periods it seems that the screen with low porosity resembled a rigid screen where the sloshing tank could be considered a smaller tank with a as the length of the tank however for other cases the discrepancy was greatly reduced when compared with experimental results the differences shown in the sloshing tank equipped with the screen were also associated with many violent phenomena across the screen that are not been properly accounted for in the present potential flow theory the above discussion can be further verified and justified by the numerical method fig 7 shows the amplification factor r a at the tank wall and normalized horizontal force by ρ g d ξ on a porous screen p 0 1 as a function of the submergence depth d h 0 2 0 4 0 6 and 0 8 and non dimensional frequencies ω 2 h g for a h 4 0 and ε 0 3 the five lowest non dimensional natural frequencies ω n 2 h g n 1 2 3 4 5 for the tank without a screen with a h 4 were 0 1467 0 5151 0 9741 1 4407 and 1 8876 correspondingly in the case of the tank without a screen the resonances occurred at the non dimensional natural frequencies of n 1 3 and 5 with a minimal contribution at the second and fourth modes in the non dimensional frequency range the lowest first mode had the lowest peak amplitude compared with the third and fifth modes by introducing the screen for different submergence depths the peak amplitudes were reduced due to the energy dissipation at the slotted screen the higher the submergence depths of the screen the lower the estimated amplification factor at the tank wall for various submergence depths the third mode peak locations changed noticeably compared with the first and fifth modes fig 7 b shows that sloshing induced horizontal forces on a porous screen generally had a similar tendency to the amplification factor measured at the tank wall see fig 7 a the horizontal forces see fig 7 b showed considerable variation in the range of 0 2 ω 2 h g 1 2 as the submergence depth increased the pressure difference across the porous screen became larger as a result larger horizontal forces were experienced at the higher submergence depths but this tendency was reversed after ω 2 h g 1 2 the variation in non dimensional added mass μ μ 2 ρ g h and the radiation damping coefficient ν ν 2 ω ρ g h for d h 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 with the same conditions as those in fig 7 are given in fig 8 at the first and third resonant frequencies ω 2 h g 0 14 and 0 96 the non dimensional added mass which was in phase with the acceleration of the tank reached a negative value and the damping coefficient which was in phase with the velocity of the tank reached its maximum value this unique phenomenon occurs in problems when the oscillating body excites the local hydrodynamic resonance of the enclosed fluid region in its vicinity fig 9 shows the trend of amplification factors with changing screen porosity p 0 05 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 for fixed values of d h 0 5 a h 4 0 and ε 0 3 the first third and fifth modes of non dimensional frequency seemed to be predominantly seen with peak amplitudes for the tank without and with a screen for various porosities when the peak amplitudes were compared among these three modes the first mode recorded a lower value a significant change in the location of the peak amplitude was noticeable only at the third mode the amplification factor at the fifth mode was greatly reduced as the porosity increased for the screen with porosity 0 1 the amplification factor was reduced greatly when compared with the other porosities a similar tendency to amplification factor was noticed for the horizontal force for different porosities see fig 9 b the reduction in the horizontal force with the increase of porosity was mainly due to the pressure difference across the screen 5 2 numerical results numerical simulations based on an incompressible turbulent model using the finite volume method were conducted to test the nonlinear and violent free surface effects in the presence of a slotted screen in the center of the tank for this purpose a typical period close to the peak period in which the analytical solution showed a significant difference with the experimental data was chosen for calculation the screen with p 0 0964 and p 0 3022 d h 0 5 in the motion period 0 5s which was close to the lowest resonance frequency of the tank without a screen was taken the analytical methology developed in the present study is based on quasi linear potential flow theory which generally gives the leading order solutions of the first harmonic that will be present whereas the numerical and experimental results are in the time domain which includes all the nonlinear higher harmonics therefore it would be convenient to decompose such a nonlinear time series into first harmonic and higher harmonic components and compare these with the analytical solution this will help us assess the optimum accuracy that can be achieved with the numerical solution when compared with the analytical solution the curve fitting tool with the fourier option in matlab has been employed in the present study the time series data was specified as arguments to the curve fitting tool cftool function the accuracy of the fitted curve can be examined based on the goodness of fit statistics and confidence intervals on the fitted coefficients fig 10 a and b shows the time history computed in the numerical simulation together with the experimental results for screen d h 0 5 with p 0 0964 and 0 3022 and respective harmonics in the form of the wave elevation at tank wall normalized by the tank s sway amplitude in fig 10 a the left plot comprises a top full time history recorded for the screen with p 0 0964 and in the bottom a closer look at the same time history from 20s to 30s is shown as well as the closer view alone for p 0 3022 in fig 10 b the recorded data for the experiment was taken for approximately 300s and the last 30s steady cycles were used for analysis the results show that the prediction of the numerical simulations is in good agreement with the experimental values up to second harmonics poorer comparison for the third and higher harmonics with the experimental results could be due to chosen spatial resolution this needs furthermore elaborate calculation to affirm the statement the screen with d h 0 5 with the lowest porosity 0 0964 was associated with the strong vortex at the bottom tip of the screen where the fluid moved freely under the lower part of the screen this vortex that formed at the bottom tip of the screen swayed back and forth close to the screen where the disturbance from the vortex was carried to the end of the tank along with the fluid motion and made the solution unsteady for several cycles see fig 10 c the wave run up and nonlinear wave profile were captured well at the screen by the present numerical simulations in accordance with the experimental results see fig 10 c the variations in the added mass and radiation damping coefficient were also obtained numerically based on the total force acting on the sloshing tank wall using the fourier series and these were compared with the analytical solution the total force time history f t n u m t could be transformed to the frequency domain characterized by frequency and mean displacement thus it was possible by taking the cosine and sine part of the fourier series evaluated at the fundamental frequency for comparison two sway amplitudes 0 001 m and 0 01 m were chosen the respective non dimensional added mass and radiation damping coefficient for a h 4 0 p 0 1 d h 0 6 are shown in fig 11 for small amplitude the predicted numerical simulations show good agreement with the analytical solution see fig 11 a in the case of higher sway amplitude the results were reasonably good as shown in fig 11 b it should be noted that the fourier series is sensitive to the duration of the time signal therefore in the present study proper care has been taken by choosing a long time signal for all the frequencies ω 2 h g 6 conclusions the analytical solution following a methodology similar to that of crowley and porter 2012a and molin and remy 2013 based on the linear potential flow model was developed and applied to a rectangular tank with a porous slotted screen installed at the center the present analytical approach adopts the quadratic drag law combining the energy dissipation and continuity of horizontal fluid velocity across the porous screen the analytical solution is based on the galerkin method in which the jump in the velocity potential of both sides of the porous screen is expanded by basis functions including the polynomial of chebyshev then the square root singularity at the lower edge of the screen is satisfied the results are presented as the amplification factor and dynamic pressure at the tank wall except the peak periods the analytical solution agrees well with the experimental results for both the amplification factor and pressure for a wide range of periods reasonably good agreement with the experimental data was achieved for a frictional damping coefficient ε 0 3 the differences in the analytical and experimental results have been attributed to the nonlinear effects which were verified and quantified using numerical simulations based on the incompressible turbulent model the accuracy of the presented numerical results shows good agreement up to the second harmonics with the experimental data the hydrodynamic coefficients added mass radiation damping coefficient were also obtained by taking the fourier series of the numerical solution and compared with the analytical solution the results were in good agreement for the case of low sway amplitude and acceptable for high sway amplitude finally a parametric study based on different porosities and submergence depths of the screen was carried out for a h 4 0 the estimated horizontal force on the porous screen increased with the increase in the submergence depth but the tendency was reversed after ω 2 h g 1 2 the lowest values of the amplification factor were shown at the screen with porosity p 0 1 for a submergence depth of d h 0 5 when compared with the other porosities the adopted numerical simulations and experimental results show the inadequacy of the present analytical method in revealing the important nonlinear phenomenon across the screen even though the numerical simulations are capable of supplying more elaborate results cfd simulations are computationally expensive for a parametric study the present paper provides a synergetic approach of analytical numerical and experimental analysis for better estimation of the physical parameters of the sloshing tank in the presence of a slotted screen acknowledgment this research was supported by the basic science research program through the

22513,this work investigates the application of second moment reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans closure to statistically steady flows of practical interest towards this end the numerical and modelling accuracies of a reynolds stress model rsm explicit algebraic rsm earsm and linear k ω closure are quantified for various quantities of three representative ship hydrodynamics problems the flows around a wing at 10 o of angle of attack and reynolds number r e 4 60 10 6 and the kvlcc2 tanker at r e 4 60 10 6 and 2 03 10 9 the results illustrate i that all closures enable the reduction of the iterative error to negligible levels and i i the clear modelling advantages of using rsm in comparison to the turbulent viscosity closures rsm leads to a significant reduction of the modelling error yet such computations require a larger number of iterations to achieve the specified iterative convergence criterion along with finer grids to diminish discretization errors this stems from the ability of rsm to better capture complex flow phenomena keywords second moment closure reynolds averaged navier stokes equations modelling accuracy numerical robustness numerical accuracy engineering steady flows 1 introduction the numerical simulation of turbulent flows is a challenging field of fluid mechanics which is nowadays well established in various areas of engineering its ability to complement and overcome many limitations of the existent experimental techniques along with the potential to significantly reduce costs have been the main contributors to the increasing application of such technique in industry yet the success of flow computations is critically dependent on the selected mathematical model and in particular the manner how turbulence is modelled this latter aspect often determines the requisites and accuracy of the simulations the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations have been the workhorse of industrial flow computations which typically deal with wall bounded flows characterised by complex shape configurations at reynolds numbers exceeding 10 5 davidson 2004 the reason for rans popularity stems from its fully statistical description of turbulence this feature enables rans to achieve a fair compromise between modelling accuracy and numerical requisites spatio temporal resolution iterative convergence criterion and sampling time for a variety of statistically steady flows of practical interest for statistically unsteady flows rans tends to be less advantageous due to its time dependent nature and recognised limitations to predict problems where the spectral signatures of the coherent and turbulent fields overlap pereira et al 2018a 2018b 2019a 2019b note that although scale resolving simulation srs models such as large eddy simulation smagorinsky 1963 hybrid spalart et al 1997 2006 shur et al 2008 and bridging girimaji 2005 chaouat and schiestel 2005 schiestel and dejoan 2005 methods have the potential to enhance the modelling accuracy of the computations their predictive application may reveal excessively demanding and complex for most industrial applications requiring multiple flow configurations and results within days pereira 2018 nonetheless the consequence of a fully statistical representation of turbulence is the fact that the modelling accuracy of rans becomes determined by the constitutive relation used to represent the entire turbulent field from the largest and energetic turbulent scales dependent on boundary conditions to the smallest and dissipative structures the governing equations of rans result from applying the reynolds averaging reynolds 1895 operator time space or ensemble average to the navier stokes equations in this manner the dependent quantities of the rans equations are averaged quantities and the effect of the turbulent field in the momentum transport is represented through the so called reynolds stress tensor τ i j such turbulent quantity however makes the resultant system of equations undetermined and so it needs to be modelled this is accomplished through a constitutive relation named turbulence closure an extensive description of available closure strategies of practical interest is given for instance in wilcox 2006 piquet 1999 pope 2000 or hanjalić and launder 2011 most industrial rans computations rely on single point closures based on the boussinesq hypothesis boussinesq 1877 owing to its simplicity and numerical robustness such relation establishes an analogy between the momentum transfer resultant from molecular gas and turbulent motions so that the turbulent stresses are assumed linearly proportional to the strain rate tensor s i j the constant of proportionality is the turbulent viscosity which is calculated from algebraic relations or turbulence quantities obtained from the solution of transport equations the mixing length model of baldwin and lomax 1978 the one equation of spalart and allmaras 1992 and the two equation k ε of jones and launder 1972 k ω of wilcox 1988 and k ω shear stress transport sst of menter 1994 are examples of well known linear turbulent viscosity closures this class of closure strategy can provide reasonable predictions of mean flow quantities of engineering interest for a wide range of statistically steady flows furthermore these models are relatively easy to use and the additional viscosity increases the numerical robustness of the flow solvers the latter aspect is a relevant feature to deal with the complex shape geometries of industrial flow problems despite the recognised merits and popularity linear turbulent viscosity closures possess fundamental deficiencies that may lead to excessively large modelling errors in various modern engineering problems flows exhibiting strong pressure gradients and reattachment regions streamline curvature or rotation body forces relevant effects of turbulent stress transport or anisotropy of the reynolds stress tensor are some of these cases the prediction of such flow features is therefore outside the envelope of rans closures based on the boussinesq hypothesis an alternative modelling strategy within the rans framework is to calculate the individual components of the reynolds stress tensor from modelled transport equations this technique is named second moment closure and has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of linear turbulent viscosity models without the computational burden of srs methods considering a reynolds stress model rsm the generation terms of the individual components of the reynolds stress tensor are exactly calculated and the anisotropy and transport of the turbulent stresses are better represented due to the use of transport equations nonetheless and apart from its potential rsm closure has three main shortcomings i some terms of its governing equations require modelling in particular the pressure strain correlation and those in the length scale determining equation ω equation in section 2 3 ii the numerical stiffness of such equations may hamper the reduction of the iterative error to adequate levels and finally iii the additional computational cost of resolving seven transport equations six components of τ i j and dissipation these three aspects are perhaps the main contributors for some reluctance of industrial cfd practitioners in using second moment closure hanjalić 2005 nonetheless it is important to mention that the research conducted in second moment closure over the past decades has enhanced the accuracy and robustness of these models wilcox 2006 launder et al 1975 speziale et al 1991 eisfeld and brodersen 2005 mishra and girimaji 2017 and that even with the required modelling there is no evidence that a rsm performs worse than a linear turbulent viscosity model launder 1989a when used with adequate numerical settings in regard to the additional computing cost it is also not expected that rsm simulations prove to be more demanding than srs for statistically steady flows a comprehensive review of second moment closure is given in launder 1989a 1989b and hanjalić 1999 2005 a different approach also employed in engineering to improve the accuracy of linear turbulent viscosity closures is the use of non linear turbulent viscosity models this class of closures explores the non linearity between the reynolds stress and strain rate tensors or the anisotropy of the turbulent field by modifying the boussinesq hypothesis in this manner their modelling accuracy is expected to lie between that of linear turbulent viscosity and second moment closures the v 2 f parneix et al 1998 algebraic reynolds stress model arsm rodi 1976 explicit arsm earsm wallin and johansson 2000 dol et al 2002 and lag model olsen and coakley 2001 closures are examples of such formulations the objective of this work is to investigate the application of rans supplemented with a rsm closure to statistically steady flows of engineering relevance therefore the advantages and disadvantages of using second moment closure are assessed and compared to those of linear and non linear turbulent viscosity closures towards this end the numerical and modelling accuracies of the rsm of eisfeld eisfeld 2004 eisfeld and brodersen 2005 eisfeld et al 2016 earsm of dol et al 2002 and k ω shear stress transport sst of menter et al 2003 are quantified for distinct flow quantities of three representative ship hydrodynamics problems the flow past a rectangular wing with a naca0012 section at ten degrees of angle of attack and reynolds number 4 60 10 6 chow et al 1997 and the flows around the kvlcc2 tanker at model and full scale reynolds numbers 4 6 10 6 lee et al 2003 and 2 03 10 9 respectively although the modelling accuracy is not assessed for the latter test case due to the unavailability of experimental data such problem is used to evaluate the numerical robustness of the closures due to the high reynolds number as well as scale effects between model and full scale problems all numerical simulations are performed without using wall functions the remainder of this manuscript is structured as follows section 2 presents the governing equations of the three closures examined in this work whereas section 3 describes the flow problems and the numerical details of the computations relevant aspects contributing to the robustness of the rsm closure are analysed as well as the iterative convergence of the simulations thereafter section 4 presents and discusses the results while the conclusions of this study are summarised in section 5 2 reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the application of the reynolds averaging reynolds 1895 operator time space or ensemble average to the navier stokes equations leads to the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations 1 v i x i 0 2 d v i d t 1 ρ p x i ν 2 v i x j x j 1 ρ τ i j x j where x i are the coordinates of a cartesian coordinate system v i are the cartesian components of the averaged velocity ρ is the fluid density p is the averaged pressure ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity and τ i j is the reynolds stress tensor furthermore the fluid is assumed newtonian incompressible and in single phase the previous system of equations is not closed due to the reynolds stress tensor the three closure strategies used in this investigation are described below 2 1 k ω shear stress transport the k ω shear stress transport sst of menter 1994 is one of the most popular linear turbulent viscosity closures used in industrial computations the reynolds stress tensor is computed from the boussinesq hypothesis boussinesq 1877 3 τ i j ρ 2 ν t s i j 2 3 k δ i j where ν t is the turbulent viscosity s i j is the strain rate tensor 4 s i j 1 2 v i x j v j x i k is the specific turbulence kinetic energy and δ i j is the kronecker symbol the turbulent variables ν t and k in equation 3 are not known and so require further modelling the sst closure calculates these quantities by combining the k ω and k ε closures and limiting the magnitude of ν t to avoid the overprediction of the reynolds stress tensor in adverse pressure gradient flows menter 1994 hence the turbulent viscosity is defined as 5 ν t a 1 k max a 1 ω s f 2 where s is the magnitude of the strain rate tensor ω is the specific dissipation rate f 2 is an auxiliary function defining the regions where the limiter is applied and a 1 is a coefficient on the other hand the turbulence kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate are computed from the following transport equations 6 d k d t p k β ω k x j ν ν t σ k k x j 7 d ω d t α ν t p k β ω 2 x j ν ν t σ ω ω x j 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k x j ω x j where p k ν t s 2 is the production of k f 1 is an auxiliary function defining the areas where the k ω and k ε closures are applied and α β β σ k σ ω and σ ω 2 are coefficients the auxiliary functions and coefficients are given in menter et al 2003 2 2 k ω explicit algebraic reynolds stress model the idea of an earsm is to enhance the modelling accuracy of a linear turbulent viscosity closure without experiencing the additional cost and stiffness of a rsm closure towards this end an anisotropy turbulence tensor a i j e x is added to the boussinesq assumption so that the reynolds stress tensor better represents anisotropy effects in this manner the reynolds stress tensor is defined as 8 τ i j ρ 2 ν t s i j 2 3 k δ i j a i j e x k the methodology for the derivation of a i j e x can be found in wallin and johansson 2000 in the earsm proposed by dol et al 2002 the anisotropy tensor is computed as 9 a i j e x β 3 ω i k ω k j i i ω δ i j 3 β 4 s i k ω k j ω i k s k j β 6 s i k ω k l ω l j ω i k ω k l s l j β 6 i i ω s i j 2 i v δ i j 3 β 9 ω i k s k l ω l m ω m j ω i k ω k l s l m ω m j where ω i j is the vorticity tensor 10 ω i j 1 2 v i x j v j x i i i ω ω k l ω l k and i v s k l ω l m ω m k are velocity invariants and β i are coefficients defined in dol et al 2002 note that the superscript indicates that a quantity has been normalised by 1 0 09 ω the turbulent viscosity is then calculated from 11 ν t c μ k 0 09 ω whereas the turbulence kinetic energy and specific dissipation are determined from equation 6 and 12 d ω d t α ν t p k β ω 2 x j ν ν t σ ω ω x j σ d ω max k x j ω x j 0 the coefficient c μ in equation 11 and those in equations 6 and 12 are defined in dol et al 2002 2 3 reynolds stress model contrary to a turbulent viscosity closure a rsm determines the components of the reynolds stress tensor through the solution of modelled transport equations in the case of the rsm closure proposed by eisfeld eisfeld 2004 eisfeld and brodersen 2005 eisfeld et al 2016 these possess the following form 13 d ρ r i j d t ρ p i j ρ π i j ρ ε i j ρ d i j where p i j is the production of the specific reynolds stress tensor r i j ρ r i j τ i j π i j is the pressure strain correlation term ε i j the dissipation of r i j and d i j is the diffusive term the four terms are defined as follows 14 p i j r i k v j x k r j k v i x k 15 ε i j 2 3 0 09 k ω δ i j with k τ i i 2 16 π i j 0 09 c 1 k ω c 1 p k k 2 a i j 0 09 c 2 k ω a i k a k j a k l a k l δ i j 3 c 3 c 3 a k l a k l k s i j c 4 k a i k s j k a j k s i k 2 a k l s k l δ i j 3 c 5 k a i k ω j k a j k ω i k where the anisotropy tensor is defined as 17 a i j r i j k 2 3 δ i j and the coefficients c i and c i are given in eisfeld 2004 and 18 d i j x j ν ν t d 0 09 r i j x j where d is a coefficient eisfeld 2004 similarly to the sst approach the coefficients in this closure are defined to combine the models of launder et al 1975 lrr and speziale et al 1991 ssg finally the specific turbulence dissipation is calculated from equation 12 using the coefficients given in eisfeld 2004 the production term defined as p k k 2 and the turbulent viscosity given by 19 ν t k ω 3 flow problems and numerical details 3 1 flow problems the former closure strategies are evaluated in simulation of representative test cases the details of such flows are given below 3 1 1 wingtip vortex flow the wingtip vortex flow of chow et al 1997 has been designed to investigate the dynamics of such coherent structures and provide validation data for turbulence modelling the experiments are conducted in a wind tunnel with a cross section of 0 66 width by 1 00 height chords and a reynolds number r e based on the incoming streamwise velocity v and wing s chord c of 4 60 10 6 this leads to a mach number of approximately 0 15 the model is a rectangular wing with a naca0012 section an aspect ratio of 0 75 and a rounded wingtip furthermore its leading edge is located at 0 15 c from the inlet of the wind tunnel and the geometric angle of attack is ten degrees transition to turbulence is forced through tripping elements collocated at the leading edge region the experimental measurements chow et al 1997 used in this investigation as reference are obtained as follows the velocity field at the inlet is measured with a hot wire anemometer while the pressure on the wing s surface and tip vortex is acquired through pressure taps and probes the reported experimental uncertainties are 2 0 for the velocity field and 1 1 for the pressure coefficient at the wingtip vortex 3 1 2 kvlcc2 tanker the kvlcc2 tanker is a standard problem of ship hydrodynamics which is used to evaluate the modelling accuracy of turbulence models predicting integral and local flow quantities as well as a variety of vortical structures lee et al 2003 kim et al 2001 fureby et al 2016 the experimental measurements of lee et al 2003 are used here to determine the modelling error in the prediction of the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy fields at the propeller plane such experiments are conducted in a wind tunnel using a double body model and the reynolds number based on the incoming streamwise velocity v and the ship characteristic length l pp is 4 60 10 6 the experimental facility has a cross section of 0 65 l pp width by 0 54 l pp height which leads to a blockage of 6 6 moreover the incoming flow is aligned with the model and tripping elements are used at the bow to trigger turbulence transition the quantities here evaluated have been measured with a hot wire anemometer and the reported uncertainties are 0 5 for v 1 0 7 for v 2 1 0 for v 3 and 12 8 for k this flow configuration was never studied experimentally at the full scale reynolds number 2 03 10 9 owing to the complexity and cost involved in such measurements although this precludes the estimation of modelling errors such case is used to evaluate the numerical robustness of the closures i e the ability to reduce the iterative error to negligible levels and assess the effect of the turbulence closure in the determination of scale effects included in model testing 3 2 simulations details the computations are performed with the community based open usage solver refresco refresco 2019 the governing equations of the three rans models described in section 2 are written in strong conservation form and discretized using a finite volume technique with cell centred collocated variables a pressure correction equation based on the simple algorithm is used to ensure mass conservation the spatial discretization schemes are second order accurate the exceptions are the convective terms in the transport equations of the rans closures which are discretized with a first order accurate upwind scheme the momentum equations are linearised with picard s method and a segregated approach is adopted for the solution of all transport equations the simulations are run in parallel using mpi and subdomain decomposition all numerical simulations assume statistically steady flow this option has been taken after initial testing shown that steady and time dependent computations lead to similar results for the wingtip vortex and kvlcc2 flows round off and iterative errors are reduced to negligible levels through the use of double precision and a tight iterative convergence criterion c i t 10 7 for the wingtip vortex case and 10 8 for both kvlcc2 flows these criteria are applied to the maximum normalised residual of each dependent variable φ 20 c i t 1 φ ref max a i j φ b i a i i 1 i j n c here φ ref is a reference quantity used to normalize the residual a i j is the coefficient matrix of the linear system b i the right hand side vector and n c is the total number of cells note that such definition of c i t has proven to be two orders of magnitude tighter than the traditional l 2 norm root mean square of the residual hence a criterion of for example 10 7 leads to a l 2 norm of the residual of approximately 10 9 it is relevant to mention that the iterative convergence criterion selected for the wingtip vortex case has not been achieved for rsm computations using grids g 1 g 2 and g 4 see section 3 2 1 this result is not caused by the robustness of the rsm but rather by the ability of such closure to predict a stronger and longer vortex which moves the maximum residual to the outlet boundary nonetheless and apart from the iterative convergence such aspect has a negligible influence on the results since the residuals in the interior of the domain do not exceed o 10 4 the specificities of each flow problem are now described in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 3 2 1 wingtip vortex flow the computational domain used in the simulations is a rectangular prism defined in a cartesian coordinate system x 1 x 2 x 3 centred at the quarter chord point of the wing s root fig 1 the axes of such reference frame are aligned with the streamwise flow x 1 vertical direction x 2 and wing s span x 3 the dimensions of the domain replicate the experimental apparatus of chow et al 1997 hence the vertical and spanwise boundaries are located at x 2 c 0 33 x 3 c 0 0 and 1 0 while the inlet is placed at x 1 c 0 396 the exception is the outlet boundary which is located at x 1 c 10 0 the boundary conditions prescribed on the former boundaries are the following the velocity field at the inlet boundary is specified from the available experimental measurements at this location the pressure is extrapolated from the interior of the domain and the turbulence quantities result from setting a turbulence intensity of i 0 15 as in the experiments and a ratio between turbulent and molecular kinematic viscosities of ν t ν 0 78 to attain ω c v 20 same order of magnitude of that recommended by menter 1994 on the other hand the pressure is imposed at the outflow boundary while the streamwise derivatives of the remainder dependent variables are set equal to zero at the lateral walls of the domain the normal velocity and normal derivative of the remainder dependent quantities are set equal to zero the exceptions are the shear components of the reynolds stress tensor possessing the same index of the wall plane τ i j 0 for an x i or x j plane these are defined equal to zero no slip and impermeability conditions are specified on the wing s surface moreover the pressure normal derivative and all turbulence quantities except ω are set equal to zero the ω turbulence quantity is defined at the centre of the nearest wall cell as ω 80 ν d 2 wilcox 2006 the computational domain is then discretized into a set of ten multi block nearly geometrically similar structured grids these grids possess a number of cells n c ranging from 942 120 g 10 to 55 951 239 g 1 corresponding to a refinement level r of 3 90 the finest grid has a maximum dimensionless cell length in wall units in the tangential x t normal x n and spanwise x s directions of 815 6 0 5 and 802 7 respectively a picture of the grid resolution on the wing s surface and at a plane of the wingtip vortex is shown in fig 1 the complete description of the numerical setup and assessment of the results for this flow problem is given in pereira et al 2019c and pereira 2018 note however that for the present study we extended sst and earsm computations to grids g 1 and g 2 3 2 2 kvlcc2 tanker as described in section 3 1 2 the experimental measurements of lee et al 2003 have been conducted in a wind tunnel with a double model of the kvlcc2 tanker for this reason the flow around the kvlcc2 tanker at model and full scale reynolds numbers is assumed symmetric so that only half ship is considered a quarter of the double body model used in the experiments all simulations are conducted in a prismatic rectangular domain defined in a cartesian coordinate system x 1 x 2 x 3 with the x 1 axis aligned with the streamwise flow pointing to the bow the transverse x 2 axis perpendicular to the symmetry plane of the ship and the vertical direction x 3 forming a right handed system the origin of such reference frame is located at the intersection of the symmetry plane of the ship the keel line and the aft perpendicular fig 2 at model scale the cross section of the computational domain replicates the dimensions of the experimental apparatus of lee et al 2003 therefore and recalling that only half ship is considered the domain has a cross section of 0 33 l pp width by 0 27 l pp height with the symmetry plane located at x 2 l p p 0 0 and the water surface double body symmetry plane at x 3 l p p 0 065 furthermore the length of the domain is 4 0 l p p with the inlet boundary placed at x 1 l p p 2 0 in regard to boundary conditions the velocity and turbulence quantities are set uniform at the inlet boundary the latter quantities result from a turbulence intensity of i 0 15 to mimic the experimental conditions of lee et al 2003 and a ratio between turbulent and molecular kinematic viscosities of ν t ν 0 01 the pressure on the other hand is extrapolated from the interior of the domain at the outflow hull and domain walls the conditions are equal to those specified for the wingtip vortex case symmetry conditions are prescribed at the water surface and symmetry plane of the ship so that the normal derivative of all dependent quantities is equal to zero the exceptions are once again the shear components of the reynolds stress tensor which are defined in the same manner as for the lateral walls see section 3 2 1 the computational domain and boundary conditions employed in full scale computations are very similar to those used at model scale the differences lie on a larger cross section and the turbulence intensity and ratio between turbulent and molecular kinematic viscosities specified at the inlet whereas the cross section is enlarged to 1 00 l pp width by 1 065 l pp height to better replicate operation conditions and reduce blockage effects the turbulence intensity is equal to i 1 5 while ν t ν 44 1 note that such value of ν t ν maintains the ratio ν t ν r e constant when at model scale ν t ν 0 1 as for the wingtip vortex case the simulations at both reynolds numbers are performed in multi block nearly geometrically similar structured grids however whereas model scale simulations use nine grids varying from 764 544 g 9 to 47 612 928 g 1 cells which lead to a refinement level r of 4 0 full scale computations use the five finest grids of pereira et al 2017 these cover a grid refinement level r of 2 0 and range from 2 616 248 g 5 to 20 975 616 g 1 cells the resultant x t x n and x s for the finest grid resolution are 407 1 0 15 83 7 at model scale and 229 232 0 16 and 38 724 at full scale the spatial resolution on the ship s stern and bow of the finest grid used in model scale computations is depicted in fig 2 3 3 numerical robustness one of the shortcomings and criticisms attributed to second moment closure is the numerical stiffness of its governing equations which may preclude the reduction of the iterative error to adequate levels this feature is particularly relevant for engineering flows dealing with complex shape configurations at high reynolds numbers for this reason we have adopted a set of numerical strategies to improve the robustness of the rsm the simplest approach to implement a rsm closure is the explicit addition of τ i j to the averaged momentum equations however in comparison to a turbulent viscosity closure this strategy increases the stiffness of the resultant system of equations an alternative strategy that improves the numerical robustness is to implement rsm as an earsm closure in this manner the turbulent viscosity equation 19 is first used to estimate the reynolds stress tensor as τ i j 2 ν t s i j 2 3 k δ i j with τ i j being implicitly added left hand side to the averaged momentum equations then and similar to equation 8 the reynolds stress tensor is explicitly right hand side corrected with the difference between the reynolds stress tensor components calculated from the transport equations and 2 ν t s i j 2 3 k δ i j the four terms present in the right hand side of equation 13 p i j π i j ε i j and d i j have been carefully decomposed so that negative sub terms involving the τ i j component being calculated are handled implicitly left hand side in the case of the pressure strain correlation term π i j only the component 0 09 c 1 k ω a i j is currently being checked all grids used in this investigation are multi block structured grids despite the complexity involved in their generation structured grids possess the potential to increase the simulations convergence rate and smoothness in comparison to unstructured grids for instance structured grids can enhance grid quality by preventing excentricity errors caused by hanging nodes jasak 1996 juretik 2004 these tend to reduce the robustness and numerical accuracy jasak 1996 juretik 2004 pereira 2012 of simulations using unstructured grids furthermore special attention has been paid to avoid excessively large aspect ratios in cells located in the near wall region of curved surfaces see the values of x i given in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 explicit relaxation has been used to enhance the performance of the iterative method used to solve the system of discretized equations refresco 2017 ferziger and perić 2002 this technique determines the unknown dependent quantity at a given iteration φ k 1 as a combination of the value obtained from the solution of the respective linear equation φ and the value predicted in the previous iteration φ k the weight of each component is determined by the explicit relaxation parameter α e which ranges from 0 0 to 1 0 21 φ k 1 φ k α e φ φ k the consequence of this technique is an increase of the code robustness at the expense of a slower convergence rate in the present simulations explicit relaxation is applied to all dependent variables of the momentum pressure and turbulence equations the pressure equation required the lowest values of α e these reaching 0 005 for the case of the kvlcc2 tanker at full scale additionally the diagonal dominance of the linear system of equations can be improved through implicit relaxation refresco 2017 ferziger and perić 2002 the linear system of equations a φ k 1 b is therefore relaxed according to 22 a 1 α i α i i a φ k 1 b 1 α i α i i a φ k where i is the identity matrix and α i is the implicit relaxation parameter which ranges from 0 0 to 1 0 and is applied to the momentum and turbulence equations such type of under relaxation is essential to avoid divergence when there is a poor initial guess of the solution this is often the case for rsm computations in the present study such closure required values of α i as low as 0 2 during the initialisation of the flow around the kvlcc2 tanker at full scale the combination of these strategies is expected to enhance the numerical robustness of rans rsm enabling the reduction of the residuals to the selected iterative convergence criteria this is illustrated in fig 3 where the convergence history of the dependent quantities exhibiting the maximum residual in the kvlcc2 simulations is depicted the first and most significant result shown in fig 3 is the fact that the selected rsm closure and its implementation are sufficiently robust to reduce the residuals below 10 8 for the kvlcc2 cases 10 7 for the wingtip vortex flow furthermore the data contained in these plots indicate that the initial convergence is in general irregular until the residuals reach a threshold value depending on the case it may vary from 10 1 to 10 4 it is also important to mention that all simulations started from an initial solution based on the conditions prescribed at the inlet whereas such usual option did not pose significant challenges for the cases at r e 4 60 10 6 it proved to be particularly inadequate for the kvlcc2 tanker at full scale using the rsm closure for this reason the initialisation of this case required small relaxation parameters α i 0 2 and α e 0 005 which reduced the convergence rate once the maximum residuals decreased below 1 3 10 1 it was possible to increase the values of the relaxation parameters to α i 0 80 and α e 0 03 these two regions are clearly visible in fig 3b due to the sudden increase in the iterative convergence rate of the solutions such initialisation period required 39 493 iterations for the sst 54 294 for the earsm and 70 491 for the rsm the convergence history of the residuals also shows that the earsm and rsm require a larger number of iterations than the sst closure yet the simple comparison of the number of iterations of each closure without examining the predicted flow features may lead to misleading conclusions about the robustness and cost of the simulations therefore the major conclusion that can be drawn from fig 3 for now is the fact that the rsm closure is sufficiently robust to simulate the selected complex flow configurations the cost of the simulations is addressed later 4 results and discussion the ability of the selected rans closures to predict the flow problems described in section 3 is now evaluated towards this end numerical and modelling errors are quantified for various quantities of engineering interest with the magnitude of the round off and iterative errors reduced to negligible levels when compared to the discretization error the results presented in this section are obtained in the finest resolution of each grid set since these lead to the lowest numerical errors the remainder grid solutions are used to estimate the numerical uncertainty u n φ through the method proposed by eça and hoekstra 2014 based on grid refinement studies and to illustrate the grid sensitivity of the results the modelling error on the other hand is quantified through the comparison error e c φ defined as the difference between the predicted φ and experimental value φ e and with the multivariate metric r r ref hills 2006 the american society of m 2016 for local flow quantities in n locations 23 r r ref i n e c φ i 2 u v φ i 2 n 2 n in equation 23 i is the index of a given point and u v φ is the validation uncertainty defined as u v φ u n φ 2 u e φ e 2 note that the former expression assumes that the input uncertainty is zero and that the numerical u n φ and experimental u e φ e uncertainties are uncorrelated the value of r r ref gives a quantitative measurement of the discrepancies between simulations and experiments it can be interpreted in the following manner values of r r ref larger than unity indicate that the overall comparison error exceeds the level of the validation uncertainty while r r ref below one represents the opposite a complete description of this validation technique is found in supplement 1 of asme v v 20 2009 report the american society of m 2016 the present section starts by discussing the results for each flow problem sections 4 1 to 4 3 it concludes in section 4 4 with the evaluation of the computations cost all the analysed quantities are normalised by v ρ and the reference length scale c or l p p 4 1 wingtip vortex flow the prediction of wingtip vortex flows is a challenging problem of fluid mechanics for both numerical and modelling reasons whereas the steep velocity and pressure gradients observed at the core of such vortical structures require high quality discretization techniques to diminish the discretization error the phenomena of solid body rotation and low intensity turbulence occurring at the inner core of wingtip vortices pose difficulties to turbulence modelling this stems from the traditional use of rans with closures based on the boussinesq hypothesis which are inadequate to predict curvature and rotation effects srs methods on the other hand have the potential to improve the predictions accuracy but their correct application may reveal excessively demanding and complex for statistically steady flows of industrial interest this has been recently discussed in pereira et al 2019c the importance of the first aspect is shown in table 1 and fig 4 referring to table 1 the predicted friction c f and pressure c d and c l coefficients indicate that the numerical uncertainty associated with their calculation is relatively small in fact the estimates for the numerical uncertainty do not exceed 2 6 of the predicted value for c f and 1 2 for the pressure coefficients these results indicate that the current grid resolution is adequate for the calculation of such integral quantities on the other hand the predictions of the pressure coefficient at the wingtip vortex centre presented in fig 4 exhibit a much stronger dependence on the grid resolution which is clearly influenced by the selected closure whereas the differences between solutions obtained in grids g 7 n c 6 993 936 and g 1 n c 55 951 239 are negligible for the sst model the rsm closure has a much larger dependence on the grid resolution in this case the pressure coefficient at x 1 c 1 4 experiences a monotonic reduction of approximately 1 02 from grids g 10 to g 7 r 2 0 and 0 67 from g 7 to g 1 r 2 0 furthermore solely the three finest grids seem adequate for rsm computations since only these resolutions lead to reduced variations upon grid refinement regarding the earsm the simulations exhibit two distinct trends i upstream of the trailing edge x 1 c 0 74 the earsm solutions experience a grid dependence similar to the rsm and ii in the near wake the earsm solutions show significantly smaller differences with the spatial resolution than the rsm for example the discrepancies observed between grids g 5 n c 16 542 464 and g 1 are smaller than those obtained between grids g 3 and g 1 with rsm fig 4 also highlights the importance of grid refinement studies verification exercises in the evaluation of mathematical models since the three closures lead to similar solutions in the coarsest grids due to discretization errors the results depicted in fig 4 have shown the relevance of the discretization strategy to the accuracy of the simulations they also indicate that the rsm is more demanding than the remainder closures owing to a larger dependence on the grid resolution yet solely this closure strategy maintains an approximately constant pressure coefficient at the wingtip vortex centre in the wake region x 1 c 0 74 this feature indicates that the rsm predicts a stronger and longer wingtip vortex which leads to steeper velocity gradients and inevitably to larger numerical requisites the differences in magnitude and length between the three closures are further illustrated in fig 5 where the magnitude of the pressure coefficient is depicted at various cross sections of the wingtip vortex the qualitative comparison of the three closures with the experimental measurements of chow et al 1997 shows a rapid diffusion of the wingtip vortex downstream the trailing edge by the sst and earsm closures the rsm does not exhibit the former behaviour instead achieving a good agreement with the experiments this is clearly illustrated by fig 6 such figure also shows that the sst closure leads to the largest comparison errors in both the wing and wake regions for instance the magnitude of the comparison error at x 1 c 1 4 is 2 7 for the sst while for the rsm is 0 2 0 1 using the predicted vortex centre pereira et al 2019c note that at such location the experimental value is approximately 3 6 similar to the grid requisites the earsm exhibits two distinct behaviours i a reasonable agreement with the experiments upstream the trailing edge which is comparable to that obtained by the rsm closure this trend is also evident in fig 7 where the pressure coefficient on wing s surface is depicted at two cross sections of the wing and ii large comparison errors downstream the trailing edge owing to a rapid diffusion of the vortex responsible for the increase of the pressure coefficient the previous conclusions are supported by the outcome of the quantification of the modelling error based on the multivariate metric r r ref table 2 in this case the ten locations with available experimental measurements see fig 6 are used to determine r r ref the values of r r ref reflect the decrease in modelling error from sst to rsm solutions observed in fig 6 whereas the value of r r ref reaches 9 5 for the sst and 5 5 for the earsm the rsm closure decreases this value to 2 6 furthermore such value reduces to 1 0 when the pressure coefficient obtained at the predicted wingtip vortex centre is used instead of that measured experimentally 4 2 kvlcc2 at r e 4 60 10 6 the second test case is the flow around the kvlcc2 tanker at model scale this benchmark case of ship hydrodynamics poses various difficulties to turbulence modelling owing to its complex geometry and the development of multiple vortical structures such as the bilge vortex these features and availability of experimental measurements are the reason for its selection and popularity in numerical ship hydrodynamics larsson et al 2002 larsson et al 2010 hino 2005 simman 2008 simman 2014 simman 2019 table 3 presents the force coefficients predicted by the different rans closures along with the respective numerical uncertainty it is important to recall that the current computational domain replicates the experimental apparatus of lee et al 2003 for this reason the total resistance coefficient c t measured by kim et al 2001 in a towing tank is not used to estimate modelling errors owing to the reduced blockage coefficient 0 35 of such experiments the results of table 3 are therefore used to infer the influence of the closure strategy and grid resolution in the prediction of the force coefficients they show that the pressure c p friction c f and total c t c t c p c f resistance coefficients vary up to 11 3 7 8 and 6 1 with the closure sst results used as reference this confirms the importance of the turbulence model for the prediction of such integral quantities furthermore and similarly to the results of pereira et al 2017 the earsm predicts the lowest values of c f and c t referring to the numerical uncertainty the estimates shown in table 3 do not exceed 5 8 of the predicted pressure coefficient and 1 7 for the remainder coefficients along with variations inferior to 3 2 upon grid refinement from n c 764 544 to 47 612 928 these results point out the adequacy of the finest grid resolution to diminish the discretization error in such integral quantities naturally the reported numerical uncertainties and variation upon grid refinement increase for local flow quantities in general these may increase more than one order of magnitude fig 8 illustrates this tendency by depicting the observed changes in the streamwise velocity field v 1 at the propeller plane from the coarsest to the finest grid r 4 0 as well as from the intermediate n c 5 996 544 to the finest one r 2 0 the results indicate that the discrepancies between the finest and the coarsest grid resolutions may exceed 19 of the incoming flow velocity in the bilge vortex region whereas for a refinement ratio of 2 0 these do not exceed 10 the modelling accuracy of the three closures predicting the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy fields at the propeller plane is evaluated in fig 9 and table 4 as for the wingtip vortex flow the qualitative assessment of the results reiterates the difficulties of the linear turbulent viscosity closure to compute wake fields featured by steady coherent structures it is clear that the intensity and dimensions of the bilge vortex are underpredicted by the sst closure the earsm and rsm closures on the other hand lead to a better qualitative agreement with the experiments the comparison error of the streamwise velocity field at the propeller plane and particularly in the bilge vortex region seems smaller for both closures yet such idea is not supported by the quantification of the modelling error shown in table 4 in fact the multivariate metric achieves similar values for the modelling accuracy of the sst and earsm closures in prediction of the streamwise and vertical velocity fields as well as of the turbulence kinetic energy this is certainly a consequence of the overprediction of the bilge vortex core by the earsm see fig 9b at x 2 l p p 0 on the contrary the rsm obtains the lowest values for v 1 and k r r ref 2 3 and 2 6 respectively in regard to the transverse and vertical velocity fields the validation metric indicates that the comparison error exceeds by at least six times the validation uncertainty r r ref 6 0 for all closures nonetheless the following factors should be considered in the interpretation of the results since they may contribute to the magnitude of r r ref i the former two components of the velocity field possess small magnitudes and so they may exhibit large comparison errors due to small discrepancies in the measured and predicted location of the bilge vortex core ii the experimental asymmetry of the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy fields at the propeller plane is much larger than the reported experimental uncertainty pereira et al 2017 and iii the use of free slip instead of no slip boundary conditions at the lateral walls of the domain may be introducing input errors the latter aspect has been tested but the unavailability of details about the boundary layers at the inlet of the wind tunnel hampers its precise evaluation finally fig 10 depicts the iso surfaces of the q criterion hunt et al 1988 to illustrate the vortical structures of the mean flow field captured by the three closures the magnitude of such quantity is selected to match that used in fureby et al 2016 the results of the various closures exhibit two major features the first is the fact that all closures can capture the bilge vortex yet the earsm and rsm closures predict a stronger bilge vortex which is two times longer than that obtained by the sst the second aspect is the presence of two secondary and smaller vortical structures these vortices are located near the water surface plane and are also observable in fig 9 in the vicinity of the hull between the three closures the earsm predicts the longest and strongest secondary vortices whereas for the earsm these are visible for q 100 the rsm and sst closures require q 90 and 50 respectively 4 3 kvlcc2 at r e 2 03 10 9 one of the advantages of cfd simulations is the ability to perform full scale computations for this reason the final case used to evaluate the selected rans closures is the flow around the kvlcc2 tanker at full scale reynolds number r e 2 03 10 9 although the unavailability of experimental measurements precludes the estimation of modelling errors this flow problem has two main objectives i demonstrate that the rsm is sufficiently robust to simulate this high reynolds number case section 3 3 and ii discuss the effect of the closure strategy and reynolds number in the flow dynamics to accomplish the second goal the full scale simulations are compared with a new set of model scale computations these have been conducted in the finest five grids of pereira et al 2017 which are similar to those used at full scale and the prescribed inflow turbulence conditions are i 1 5 and ν t ν 0 1 constant ν t ν r e the outcome of this study is presented in tables 5 and 6 and figs 11 and 12 considering tables 5 and 6 the results show an expected and significant reduction of the magnitude of all force coefficients from model to full scale simulations although this behaviour decreases the magnitude of the discrepancies between closures at full scale the results exhibit larger percent variations whereas the variation of 0 23 in c t at model scale corresponds to 5 8 the difference of 0 14 at full scale represents 8 0 sst results used as reference on the other hand the values of the form factor defined below obtained with the three closures also experience a strong dependence on the reynolds number and closure note that this quantity is sometimes assumed independent of the reynolds number and it is used in industrial marine applications to extrapolate the total resistance coefficient from model to full scale it is defined as 24 1 k c t c f 0 where c f o is the friction resistance coefficient here obtained from the ittc friction line 8 international towing t 1957 1 1 see eça and hoekstra 2008 for a comparison of various friction line models 25 c f 0 0 075 log 10 r e 2 2 the results of the various closure strategies indicate that the form factor is not independent of the reynolds number by exhibiting a reduction from model to full scale which may reach 0 08 for the rsm it is important to stress that the decrease in the magnitude of the force coefficients and form factor cannot be solely explained by discretization errors since the magnitude of the numerical uncertainty is smaller than the reduction of the former quantities the effect of the reynolds number on the flow dynamics is also observed in the streamwise velocity field v 1 at the propeller plane fig 11 naturally the increase of the reynolds number leads to a reduction of the boundary layer thickness and consequently to a reduction of the intensity and dimensions of the bilge vortex however the bilge vortex obtained at full scale reynolds number is still strongly dependent on the selected turbulence closure this is further illustrated in fig 12 where the iso surfaces of the q criterion hunt et al 1988 with magnitude q 100 are plotted for both reynolds numbers and the three closures it is clear from model to full scale that the intensity and length of the bilge vortex reduce for the earsm and rsm closures conversely the length of the secondary vortices predicted by such models experiences a significant increase such behaviour is particularly visible for the rsm whereas at model scale the secondary vortices are not visible for q 100 the rsm closure leads to the longest structures at full scale this is an important scale effect since the magnitude and dimensions of such vortical structures may prove to be crucial for the evaluation of noise signatures or environmental impacts the sst on the other hand does not exhibit secondary vortices in both cases for q 100 and the length of the bilge vortex remains approximately constant 4 4 computing cost the results discussed in sections 4 1 to 4 3 have illustrated the modeling advantages of using second moment closure over turbulent viscosity models the evaluation of the selected closures is now completed with the examination of the computing cost of the simulations table 7 presents the computing time of the simulations for each flow problem and closure strategy independently of the test case the rsm requires longer computing times to achieve the prescribed iterative convergence criterion for instance such closure exceeds by 89 0 the computing cost of the sst for the kvlcc2 tanker flows for the case of the wingtip vortex flows grid g 3 the computing cost increases by a factor of thirteen yet and in addition to the flow features captured by the rsm such increase in computing cost is mostly caused by the longer wingtip vortex which moves the maximum residual to the outflow boundary on the other hand the computing cost of earsm is consistently between that of sst and rsm however the cost of earsm computations is similar to sst for the wingtip vortex flow while it is closer to rsm for the flows around the kvlcc2 tanker considering that the first test case leads to the largest discrepancies between earsm and rsm solutions such result suggests that part of the additional computing cost is a consequence of the flow features captured by each turbulence closure an additional manner to evaluate the computing cost of the three closures is to analyse the fraction of the computing time spent solving the rans momentum and pressure and turbulent transport equations this step is presented in fig 13 for each closure and flow problem the results of fig 13 show that most of the computing time is taken by the combination of the rans and turbulent equations exceeding 96 of the total time furthermore it can also be inferred that rans rsm consumes approximately twice the computational resources of rans sst resolving the turbulent transport equations most notably the computing time spent resolving the seven equations of such closure exceeds the time taken by the rans equations for the kvlcc2 tanker at full scale on the other hand the computational burden of the earsm stays once again between the sst and rsm closures for all cases despite the additional computational cost the robustness and modelling accuracy obtained with rans rsm for the present test cases have shown that such closure strategy can be attractive for industrial applications involving statistically steady problems and mean flow quantities naturally the application of srs formulations is also expected to enhance the predictions quality however the predictive use of srs methods is significantly more demanding and complex than rans rsm for statistically steady flows this stems from three main reasons i time dependent simulations srs computations are intended to resolve at least a portion of the turbulent field and so they are inherently time dependent for this reason srs calculations need adequate temporal resolutions time step along with sufficiently long simulation times to achieve a statistically steady mean flow i e to converge the flow statistics ii numerical requisites the numerical requisites spatio temporal resolution and iterative convergence criterion of srs methods are more demanding than rans owing to their ability to resolve turbulent fluctuations for instance considering the loosest values for typical les grid requisites chapman 1979 kravchenko et al 1996 choi and moin 2012 x t 130 x n 1 x s 30 the required grid for les computations of the kvlcc2 tanker at model scale should be of the order of 10 9 cells moreover note that these criteria are based on simple boundary layer arguments and do not consider the discretization technique this may further increase the grid requisites although the use of hybrid and bridging models may relax the numerical requisites it is not expected a substantial reduction that enables daily or routinely computations for most industrial applications pereira 2018 iii boundary conditions in statistically steady flows the features of the unsteady turbulent inflow conditions are crucial to the success of srs simulations these determine various phenomena such as turbulence transition or the dynamics of coherent structures however the exact information about the inflow conditions is usually not available hampering the precise application of srs methods the consequences of this aspect are discussed in breuer 2018 or pereira 2018 keating et al 2004 and tabor and baba ahmadi 2010 present overviews of available techniques to generate proper boundary conditions for srs methods however some of these methods might be difficult to apply in routine computations all these aspects make the application of srs methods substantially more expensive than second moment rans closures for statistically steady flows therefore rans rsm seems to be an efficient tool for such class of industrial applications 5 conclusions this work has investigated the advantages of using second moment rans closure to predict statistically steady flows of engineering interest contrary to linear and non linear turbulent viscosity models second moment closures calculate the individual components of the reynolds stress tensor from modelled transport equations this is expected to enable rans to better capture complex flow phenomena without the burden of srs models to accomplish the objective of this study the numerical and modelling accuracies of the rsm of eisfeld 2004 earsm of dol et al 2002 and sst menter et al 2003 closures have been quantified and compared for various flow quantities of three representative ship hydrodynamics problems the case of the wingtip vortex resulting from the flow past a rectangular wing with a naca0012 section at ten degrees of angle of attack and reynolds number 4 60 10 6 and the flows around the kvlcc2 tanker at model and full scale reynolds numbers r e 4 60 10 6 and 2 03 10 9 respectively the main conclusions of this study are the following the present rsm closure and its implementation enable the reduction of the iterative error to negligible levels for the selected flow problems recall that these include a case at r e 2 03 10 9 nonetheless the number of iterations to achieve a given residual with such closure is larger than for the remainder rans models in addition to the robustness of the closure the observed decrease in iterative convergence rate is attributed to the modelling accuracy of rsm which enables the model capturing complex flow features the grid density required by the rsm closure to reduce the discretization error to adequate levels is substantially larger than for the sst as for the iterative convergence robustness this increase of numerical requisites is also related to the flow features captured by the rsm closure the results of the rsm have shown an enhanced modelling accuracy to predict the selected flows and quantities in comparison to the turbulent viscosity closures the rsm reduces the modelling error leading to a significantly better agreement with the experimental measurements this is particularly visible for the wingtip vortex flow overall and despite the additional cost when compared to turbulent viscosity closures this investigation has shown that rans rsm closure can be sufficiently robust and accurate to predict the selected class of statistically steady flows of engineering interest thus the results

22513,this work investigates the application of second moment reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans closure to statistically steady flows of practical interest towards this end the numerical and modelling accuracies of a reynolds stress model rsm explicit algebraic rsm earsm and linear k ω closure are quantified for various quantities of three representative ship hydrodynamics problems the flows around a wing at 10 o of angle of attack and reynolds number r e 4 60 10 6 and the kvlcc2 tanker at r e 4 60 10 6 and 2 03 10 9 the results illustrate i that all closures enable the reduction of the iterative error to negligible levels and i i the clear modelling advantages of using rsm in comparison to the turbulent viscosity closures rsm leads to a significant reduction of the modelling error yet such computations require a larger number of iterations to achieve the specified iterative convergence criterion along with finer grids to diminish discretization errors this stems from the ability of rsm to better capture complex flow phenomena keywords second moment closure reynolds averaged navier stokes equations modelling accuracy numerical robustness numerical accuracy engineering steady flows 1 introduction the numerical simulation of turbulent flows is a challenging field of fluid mechanics which is nowadays well established in various areas of engineering its ability to complement and overcome many limitations of the existent experimental techniques along with the potential to significantly reduce costs have been the main contributors to the increasing application of such technique in industry yet the success of flow computations is critically dependent on the selected mathematical model and in particular the manner how turbulence is modelled this latter aspect often determines the requisites and accuracy of the simulations the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations have been the workhorse of industrial flow computations which typically deal with wall bounded flows characterised by complex shape configurations at reynolds numbers exceeding 10 5 davidson 2004 the reason for rans popularity stems from its fully statistical description of turbulence this feature enables rans to achieve a fair compromise between modelling accuracy and numerical requisites spatio temporal resolution iterative convergence criterion and sampling time for a variety of statistically steady flows of practical interest for statistically unsteady flows rans tends to be less advantageous due to its time dependent nature and recognised limitations to predict problems where the spectral signatures of the coherent and turbulent fields overlap pereira et al 2018a 2018b 2019a 2019b note that although scale resolving simulation srs models such as large eddy simulation smagorinsky 1963 hybrid spalart et al 1997 2006 shur et al 2008 and bridging girimaji 2005 chaouat and schiestel 2005 schiestel and dejoan 2005 methods have the potential to enhance the modelling accuracy of the computations their predictive application may reveal excessively demanding and complex for most industrial applications requiring multiple flow configurations and results within days pereira 2018 nonetheless the consequence of a fully statistical representation of turbulence is the fact that the modelling accuracy of rans becomes determined by the constitutive relation used to represent the entire turbulent field from the largest and energetic turbulent scales dependent on boundary conditions to the smallest and dissipative structures the governing equations of rans result from applying the reynolds averaging reynolds 1895 operator time space or ensemble average to the navier stokes equations in this manner the dependent quantities of the rans equations are averaged quantities and the effect of the turbulent field in the momentum transport is represented through the so called reynolds stress tensor τ i j such turbulent quantity however makes the resultant system of equations undetermined and so it needs to be modelled this is accomplished through a constitutive relation named turbulence closure an extensive description of available closure strategies of practical interest is given for instance in wilcox 2006 piquet 1999 pope 2000 or hanjalić and launder 2011 most industrial rans computations rely on single point closures based on the boussinesq hypothesis boussinesq 1877 owing to its simplicity and numerical robustness such relation establishes an analogy between the momentum transfer resultant from molecular gas and turbulent motions so that the turbulent stresses are assumed linearly proportional to the strain rate tensor s i j the constant of proportionality is the turbulent viscosity which is calculated from algebraic relations or turbulence quantities obtained from the solution of transport equations the mixing length model of baldwin and lomax 1978 the one equation of spalart and allmaras 1992 and the two equation k ε of jones and launder 1972 k ω of wilcox 1988 and k ω shear stress transport sst of menter 1994 are examples of well known linear turbulent viscosity closures this class of closure strategy can provide reasonable predictions of mean flow quantities of engineering interest for a wide range of statistically steady flows furthermore these models are relatively easy to use and the additional viscosity increases the numerical robustness of the flow solvers the latter aspect is a relevant feature to deal with the complex shape geometries of industrial flow problems despite the recognised merits and popularity linear turbulent viscosity closures possess fundamental deficiencies that may lead to excessively large modelling errors in various modern engineering problems flows exhibiting strong pressure gradients and reattachment regions streamline curvature or rotation body forces relevant effects of turbulent stress transport or anisotropy of the reynolds stress tensor are some of these cases the prediction of such flow features is therefore outside the envelope of rans closures based on the boussinesq hypothesis an alternative modelling strategy within the rans framework is to calculate the individual components of the reynolds stress tensor from modelled transport equations this technique is named second moment closure and has the potential to overcome many of the limitations of linear turbulent viscosity models without the computational burden of srs methods considering a reynolds stress model rsm the generation terms of the individual components of the reynolds stress tensor are exactly calculated and the anisotropy and transport of the turbulent stresses are better represented due to the use of transport equations nonetheless and apart from its potential rsm closure has three main shortcomings i some terms of its governing equations require modelling in particular the pressure strain correlation and those in the length scale determining equation ω equation in section 2 3 ii the numerical stiffness of such equations may hamper the reduction of the iterative error to adequate levels and finally iii the additional computational cost of resolving seven transport equations six components of τ i j and dissipation these three aspects are perhaps the main contributors for some reluctance of industrial cfd practitioners in using second moment closure hanjalić 2005 nonetheless it is important to mention that the research conducted in second moment closure over the past decades has enhanced the accuracy and robustness of these models wilcox 2006 launder et al 1975 speziale et al 1991 eisfeld and brodersen 2005 mishra and girimaji 2017 and that even with the required modelling there is no evidence that a rsm performs worse than a linear turbulent viscosity model launder 1989a when used with adequate numerical settings in regard to the additional computing cost it is also not expected that rsm simulations prove to be more demanding than srs for statistically steady flows a comprehensive review of second moment closure is given in launder 1989a 1989b and hanjalić 1999 2005 a different approach also employed in engineering to improve the accuracy of linear turbulent viscosity closures is the use of non linear turbulent viscosity models this class of closures explores the non linearity between the reynolds stress and strain rate tensors or the anisotropy of the turbulent field by modifying the boussinesq hypothesis in this manner their modelling accuracy is expected to lie between that of linear turbulent viscosity and second moment closures the v 2 f parneix et al 1998 algebraic reynolds stress model arsm rodi 1976 explicit arsm earsm wallin and johansson 2000 dol et al 2002 and lag model olsen and coakley 2001 closures are examples of such formulations the objective of this work is to investigate the application of rans supplemented with a rsm closure to statistically steady flows of engineering relevance therefore the advantages and disadvantages of using second moment closure are assessed and compared to those of linear and non linear turbulent viscosity closures towards this end the numerical and modelling accuracies of the rsm of eisfeld eisfeld 2004 eisfeld and brodersen 2005 eisfeld et al 2016 earsm of dol et al 2002 and k ω shear stress transport sst of menter et al 2003 are quantified for distinct flow quantities of three representative ship hydrodynamics problems the flow past a rectangular wing with a naca0012 section at ten degrees of angle of attack and reynolds number 4 60 10 6 chow et al 1997 and the flows around the kvlcc2 tanker at model and full scale reynolds numbers 4 6 10 6 lee et al 2003 and 2 03 10 9 respectively although the modelling accuracy is not assessed for the latter test case due to the unavailability of experimental data such problem is used to evaluate the numerical robustness of the closures due to the high reynolds number as well as scale effects between model and full scale problems all numerical simulations are performed without using wall functions the remainder of this manuscript is structured as follows section 2 presents the governing equations of the three closures examined in this work whereas section 3 describes the flow problems and the numerical details of the computations relevant aspects contributing to the robustness of the rsm closure are analysed as well as the iterative convergence of the simulations thereafter section 4 presents and discusses the results while the conclusions of this study are summarised in section 5 2 reynolds averaged navier stokes equations the application of the reynolds averaging reynolds 1895 operator time space or ensemble average to the navier stokes equations leads to the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations 1 v i x i 0 2 d v i d t 1 ρ p x i ν 2 v i x j x j 1 ρ τ i j x j where x i are the coordinates of a cartesian coordinate system v i are the cartesian components of the averaged velocity ρ is the fluid density p is the averaged pressure ν is the fluid kinematic viscosity and τ i j is the reynolds stress tensor furthermore the fluid is assumed newtonian incompressible and in single phase the previous system of equations is not closed due to the reynolds stress tensor the three closure strategies used in this investigation are described below 2 1 k ω shear stress transport the k ω shear stress transport sst of menter 1994 is one of the most popular linear turbulent viscosity closures used in industrial computations the reynolds stress tensor is computed from the boussinesq hypothesis boussinesq 1877 3 τ i j ρ 2 ν t s i j 2 3 k δ i j where ν t is the turbulent viscosity s i j is the strain rate tensor 4 s i j 1 2 v i x j v j x i k is the specific turbulence kinetic energy and δ i j is the kronecker symbol the turbulent variables ν t and k in equation 3 are not known and so require further modelling the sst closure calculates these quantities by combining the k ω and k ε closures and limiting the magnitude of ν t to avoid the overprediction of the reynolds stress tensor in adverse pressure gradient flows menter 1994 hence the turbulent viscosity is defined as 5 ν t a 1 k max a 1 ω s f 2 where s is the magnitude of the strain rate tensor ω is the specific dissipation rate f 2 is an auxiliary function defining the regions where the limiter is applied and a 1 is a coefficient on the other hand the turbulence kinetic energy and specific dissipation rate are computed from the following transport equations 6 d k d t p k β ω k x j ν ν t σ k k x j 7 d ω d t α ν t p k β ω 2 x j ν ν t σ ω ω x j 2 1 f 1 σ ω 2 ω k x j ω x j where p k ν t s 2 is the production of k f 1 is an auxiliary function defining the areas where the k ω and k ε closures are applied and α β β σ k σ ω and σ ω 2 are coefficients the auxiliary functions and coefficients are given in menter et al 2003 2 2 k ω explicit algebraic reynolds stress model the idea of an earsm is to enhance the modelling accuracy of a linear turbulent viscosity closure without experiencing the additional cost and stiffness of a rsm closure towards this end an anisotropy turbulence tensor a i j e x is added to the boussinesq assumption so that the reynolds stress tensor better represents anisotropy effects in this manner the reynolds stress tensor is defined as 8 τ i j ρ 2 ν t s i j 2 3 k δ i j a i j e x k the methodology for the derivation of a i j e x can be found in wallin and johansson 2000 in the earsm proposed by dol et al 2002 the anisotropy tensor is computed as 9 a i j e x β 3 ω i k ω k j i i ω δ i j 3 β 4 s i k ω k j ω i k s k j β 6 s i k ω k l ω l j ω i k ω k l s l j β 6 i i ω s i j 2 i v δ i j 3 β 9 ω i k s k l ω l m ω m j ω i k ω k l s l m ω m j where ω i j is the vorticity tensor 10 ω i j 1 2 v i x j v j x i i i ω ω k l ω l k and i v s k l ω l m ω m k are velocity invariants and β i are coefficients defined in dol et al 2002 note that the superscript indicates that a quantity has been normalised by 1 0 09 ω the turbulent viscosity is then calculated from 11 ν t c μ k 0 09 ω whereas the turbulence kinetic energy and specific dissipation are determined from equation 6 and 12 d ω d t α ν t p k β ω 2 x j ν ν t σ ω ω x j σ d ω max k x j ω x j 0 the coefficient c μ in equation 11 and those in equations 6 and 12 are defined in dol et al 2002 2 3 reynolds stress model contrary to a turbulent viscosity closure a rsm determines the components of the reynolds stress tensor through the solution of modelled transport equations in the case of the rsm closure proposed by eisfeld eisfeld 2004 eisfeld and brodersen 2005 eisfeld et al 2016 these possess the following form 13 d ρ r i j d t ρ p i j ρ π i j ρ ε i j ρ d i j where p i j is the production of the specific reynolds stress tensor r i j ρ r i j τ i j π i j is the pressure strain correlation term ε i j the dissipation of r i j and d i j is the diffusive term the four terms are defined as follows 14 p i j r i k v j x k r j k v i x k 15 ε i j 2 3 0 09 k ω δ i j with k τ i i 2 16 π i j 0 09 c 1 k ω c 1 p k k 2 a i j 0 09 c 2 k ω a i k a k j a k l a k l δ i j 3 c 3 c 3 a k l a k l k s i j c 4 k a i k s j k a j k s i k 2 a k l s k l δ i j 3 c 5 k a i k ω j k a j k ω i k where the anisotropy tensor is defined as 17 a i j r i j k 2 3 δ i j and the coefficients c i and c i are given in eisfeld 2004 and 18 d i j x j ν ν t d 0 09 r i j x j where d is a coefficient eisfeld 2004 similarly to the sst approach the coefficients in this closure are defined to combine the models of launder et al 1975 lrr and speziale et al 1991 ssg finally the specific turbulence dissipation is calculated from equation 12 using the coefficients given in eisfeld 2004 the production term defined as p k k 2 and the turbulent viscosity given by 19 ν t k ω 3 flow problems and numerical details 3 1 flow problems the former closure strategies are evaluated in simulation of representative test cases the details of such flows are given below 3 1 1 wingtip vortex flow the wingtip vortex flow of chow et al 1997 has been designed to investigate the dynamics of such coherent structures and provide validation data for turbulence modelling the experiments are conducted in a wind tunnel with a cross section of 0 66 width by 1 00 height chords and a reynolds number r e based on the incoming streamwise velocity v and wing s chord c of 4 60 10 6 this leads to a mach number of approximately 0 15 the model is a rectangular wing with a naca0012 section an aspect ratio of 0 75 and a rounded wingtip furthermore its leading edge is located at 0 15 c from the inlet of the wind tunnel and the geometric angle of attack is ten degrees transition to turbulence is forced through tripping elements collocated at the leading edge region the experimental measurements chow et al 1997 used in this investigation as reference are obtained as follows the velocity field at the inlet is measured with a hot wire anemometer while the pressure on the wing s surface and tip vortex is acquired through pressure taps and probes the reported experimental uncertainties are 2 0 for the velocity field and 1 1 for the pressure coefficient at the wingtip vortex 3 1 2 kvlcc2 tanker the kvlcc2 tanker is a standard problem of ship hydrodynamics which is used to evaluate the modelling accuracy of turbulence models predicting integral and local flow quantities as well as a variety of vortical structures lee et al 2003 kim et al 2001 fureby et al 2016 the experimental measurements of lee et al 2003 are used here to determine the modelling error in the prediction of the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy fields at the propeller plane such experiments are conducted in a wind tunnel using a double body model and the reynolds number based on the incoming streamwise velocity v and the ship characteristic length l pp is 4 60 10 6 the experimental facility has a cross section of 0 65 l pp width by 0 54 l pp height which leads to a blockage of 6 6 moreover the incoming flow is aligned with the model and tripping elements are used at the bow to trigger turbulence transition the quantities here evaluated have been measured with a hot wire anemometer and the reported uncertainties are 0 5 for v 1 0 7 for v 2 1 0 for v 3 and 12 8 for k this flow configuration was never studied experimentally at the full scale reynolds number 2 03 10 9 owing to the complexity and cost involved in such measurements although this precludes the estimation of modelling errors such case is used to evaluate the numerical robustness of the closures i e the ability to reduce the iterative error to negligible levels and assess the effect of the turbulence closure in the determination of scale effects included in model testing 3 2 simulations details the computations are performed with the community based open usage solver refresco refresco 2019 the governing equations of the three rans models described in section 2 are written in strong conservation form and discretized using a finite volume technique with cell centred collocated variables a pressure correction equation based on the simple algorithm is used to ensure mass conservation the spatial discretization schemes are second order accurate the exceptions are the convective terms in the transport equations of the rans closures which are discretized with a first order accurate upwind scheme the momentum equations are linearised with picard s method and a segregated approach is adopted for the solution of all transport equations the simulations are run in parallel using mpi and subdomain decomposition all numerical simulations assume statistically steady flow this option has been taken after initial testing shown that steady and time dependent computations lead to similar results for the wingtip vortex and kvlcc2 flows round off and iterative errors are reduced to negligible levels through the use of double precision and a tight iterative convergence criterion c i t 10 7 for the wingtip vortex case and 10 8 for both kvlcc2 flows these criteria are applied to the maximum normalised residual of each dependent variable φ 20 c i t 1 φ ref max a i j φ b i a i i 1 i j n c here φ ref is a reference quantity used to normalize the residual a i j is the coefficient matrix of the linear system b i the right hand side vector and n c is the total number of cells note that such definition of c i t has proven to be two orders of magnitude tighter than the traditional l 2 norm root mean square of the residual hence a criterion of for example 10 7 leads to a l 2 norm of the residual of approximately 10 9 it is relevant to mention that the iterative convergence criterion selected for the wingtip vortex case has not been achieved for rsm computations using grids g 1 g 2 and g 4 see section 3 2 1 this result is not caused by the robustness of the rsm but rather by the ability of such closure to predict a stronger and longer vortex which moves the maximum residual to the outlet boundary nonetheless and apart from the iterative convergence such aspect has a negligible influence on the results since the residuals in the interior of the domain do not exceed o 10 4 the specificities of each flow problem are now described in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 3 2 1 wingtip vortex flow the computational domain used in the simulations is a rectangular prism defined in a cartesian coordinate system x 1 x 2 x 3 centred at the quarter chord point of the wing s root fig 1 the axes of such reference frame are aligned with the streamwise flow x 1 vertical direction x 2 and wing s span x 3 the dimensions of the domain replicate the experimental apparatus of chow et al 1997 hence the vertical and spanwise boundaries are located at x 2 c 0 33 x 3 c 0 0 and 1 0 while the inlet is placed at x 1 c 0 396 the exception is the outlet boundary which is located at x 1 c 10 0 the boundary conditions prescribed on the former boundaries are the following the velocity field at the inlet boundary is specified from the available experimental measurements at this location the pressure is extrapolated from the interior of the domain and the turbulence quantities result from setting a turbulence intensity of i 0 15 as in the experiments and a ratio between turbulent and molecular kinematic viscosities of ν t ν 0 78 to attain ω c v 20 same order of magnitude of that recommended by menter 1994 on the other hand the pressure is imposed at the outflow boundary while the streamwise derivatives of the remainder dependent variables are set equal to zero at the lateral walls of the domain the normal velocity and normal derivative of the remainder dependent quantities are set equal to zero the exceptions are the shear components of the reynolds stress tensor possessing the same index of the wall plane τ i j 0 for an x i or x j plane these are defined equal to zero no slip and impermeability conditions are specified on the wing s surface moreover the pressure normal derivative and all turbulence quantities except ω are set equal to zero the ω turbulence quantity is defined at the centre of the nearest wall cell as ω 80 ν d 2 wilcox 2006 the computational domain is then discretized into a set of ten multi block nearly geometrically similar structured grids these grids possess a number of cells n c ranging from 942 120 g 10 to 55 951 239 g 1 corresponding to a refinement level r of 3 90 the finest grid has a maximum dimensionless cell length in wall units in the tangential x t normal x n and spanwise x s directions of 815 6 0 5 and 802 7 respectively a picture of the grid resolution on the wing s surface and at a plane of the wingtip vortex is shown in fig 1 the complete description of the numerical setup and assessment of the results for this flow problem is given in pereira et al 2019c and pereira 2018 note however that for the present study we extended sst and earsm computations to grids g 1 and g 2 3 2 2 kvlcc2 tanker as described in section 3 1 2 the experimental measurements of lee et al 2003 have been conducted in a wind tunnel with a double model of the kvlcc2 tanker for this reason the flow around the kvlcc2 tanker at model and full scale reynolds numbers is assumed symmetric so that only half ship is considered a quarter of the double body model used in the experiments all simulations are conducted in a prismatic rectangular domain defined in a cartesian coordinate system x 1 x 2 x 3 with the x 1 axis aligned with the streamwise flow pointing to the bow the transverse x 2 axis perpendicular to the symmetry plane of the ship and the vertical direction x 3 forming a right handed system the origin of such reference frame is located at the intersection of the symmetry plane of the ship the keel line and the aft perpendicular fig 2 at model scale the cross section of the computational domain replicates the dimensions of the experimental apparatus of lee et al 2003 therefore and recalling that only half ship is considered the domain has a cross section of 0 33 l pp width by 0 27 l pp height with the symmetry plane located at x 2 l p p 0 0 and the water surface double body symmetry plane at x 3 l p p 0 065 furthermore the length of the domain is 4 0 l p p with the inlet boundary placed at x 1 l p p 2 0 in regard to boundary conditions the velocity and turbulence quantities are set uniform at the inlet boundary the latter quantities result from a turbulence intensity of i 0 15 to mimic the experimental conditions of lee et al 2003 and a ratio between turbulent and molecular kinematic viscosities of ν t ν 0 01 the pressure on the other hand is extrapolated from the interior of the domain at the outflow hull and domain walls the conditions are equal to those specified for the wingtip vortex case symmetry conditions are prescribed at the water surface and symmetry plane of the ship so that the normal derivative of all dependent quantities is equal to zero the exceptions are once again the shear components of the reynolds stress tensor which are defined in the same manner as for the lateral walls see section 3 2 1 the computational domain and boundary conditions employed in full scale computations are very similar to those used at model scale the differences lie on a larger cross section and the turbulence intensity and ratio between turbulent and molecular kinematic viscosities specified at the inlet whereas the cross section is enlarged to 1 00 l pp width by 1 065 l pp height to better replicate operation conditions and reduce blockage effects the turbulence intensity is equal to i 1 5 while ν t ν 44 1 note that such value of ν t ν maintains the ratio ν t ν r e constant when at model scale ν t ν 0 1 as for the wingtip vortex case the simulations at both reynolds numbers are performed in multi block nearly geometrically similar structured grids however whereas model scale simulations use nine grids varying from 764 544 g 9 to 47 612 928 g 1 cells which lead to a refinement level r of 4 0 full scale computations use the five finest grids of pereira et al 2017 these cover a grid refinement level r of 2 0 and range from 2 616 248 g 5 to 20 975 616 g 1 cells the resultant x t x n and x s for the finest grid resolution are 407 1 0 15 83 7 at model scale and 229 232 0 16 and 38 724 at full scale the spatial resolution on the ship s stern and bow of the finest grid used in model scale computations is depicted in fig 2 3 3 numerical robustness one of the shortcomings and criticisms attributed to second moment closure is the numerical stiffness of its governing equations which may preclude the reduction of the iterative error to adequate levels this feature is particularly relevant for engineering flows dealing with complex shape configurations at high reynolds numbers for this reason we have adopted a set of numerical strategies to improve the robustness of the rsm the simplest approach to implement a rsm closure is the explicit addition of τ i j to the averaged momentum equations however in comparison to a turbulent viscosity closure this strategy increases the stiffness of the resultant system of equations an alternative strategy that improves the numerical robustness is to implement rsm as an earsm closure in this manner the turbulent viscosity equation 19 is first used to estimate the reynolds stress tensor as τ i j 2 ν t s i j 2 3 k δ i j with τ i j being implicitly added left hand side to the averaged momentum equations then and similar to equation 8 the reynolds stress tensor is explicitly right hand side corrected with the difference between the reynolds stress tensor components calculated from the transport equations and 2 ν t s i j 2 3 k δ i j the four terms present in the right hand side of equation 13 p i j π i j ε i j and d i j have been carefully decomposed so that negative sub terms involving the τ i j component being calculated are handled implicitly left hand side in the case of the pressure strain correlation term π i j only the component 0 09 c 1 k ω a i j is currently being checked all grids used in this investigation are multi block structured grids despite the complexity involved in their generation structured grids possess the potential to increase the simulations convergence rate and smoothness in comparison to unstructured grids for instance structured grids can enhance grid quality by preventing excentricity errors caused by hanging nodes jasak 1996 juretik 2004 these tend to reduce the robustness and numerical accuracy jasak 1996 juretik 2004 pereira 2012 of simulations using unstructured grids furthermore special attention has been paid to avoid excessively large aspect ratios in cells located in the near wall region of curved surfaces see the values of x i given in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 explicit relaxation has been used to enhance the performance of the iterative method used to solve the system of discretized equations refresco 2017 ferziger and perić 2002 this technique determines the unknown dependent quantity at a given iteration φ k 1 as a combination of the value obtained from the solution of the respective linear equation φ and the value predicted in the previous iteration φ k the weight of each component is determined by the explicit relaxation parameter α e which ranges from 0 0 to 1 0 21 φ k 1 φ k α e φ φ k the consequence of this technique is an increase of the code robustness at the expense of a slower convergence rate in the present simulations explicit relaxation is applied to all dependent variables of the momentum pressure and turbulence equations the pressure equation required the lowest values of α e these reaching 0 005 for the case of the kvlcc2 tanker at full scale additionally the diagonal dominance of the linear system of equations can be improved through implicit relaxation refresco 2017 ferziger and perić 2002 the linear system of equations a φ k 1 b is therefore relaxed according to 22 a 1 α i α i i a φ k 1 b 1 α i α i i a φ k where i is the identity matrix and α i is the implicit relaxation parameter which ranges from 0 0 to 1 0 and is applied to the momentum and turbulence equations such type of under relaxation is essential to avoid divergence when there is a poor initial guess of the solution this is often the case for rsm computations in the present study such closure required values of α i as low as 0 2 during the initialisation of the flow around the kvlcc2 tanker at full scale the combination of these strategies is expected to enhance the numerical robustness of rans rsm enabling the reduction of the residuals to the selected iterative convergence criteria this is illustrated in fig 3 where the convergence history of the dependent quantities exhibiting the maximum residual in the kvlcc2 simulations is depicted the first and most significant result shown in fig 3 is the fact that the selected rsm closure and its implementation are sufficiently robust to reduce the residuals below 10 8 for the kvlcc2 cases 10 7 for the wingtip vortex flow furthermore the data contained in these plots indicate that the initial convergence is in general irregular until the residuals reach a threshold value depending on the case it may vary from 10 1 to 10 4 it is also important to mention that all simulations started from an initial solution based on the conditions prescribed at the inlet whereas such usual option did not pose significant challenges for the cases at r e 4 60 10 6 it proved to be particularly inadequate for the kvlcc2 tanker at full scale using the rsm closure for this reason the initialisation of this case required small relaxation parameters α i 0 2 and α e 0 005 which reduced the convergence rate once the maximum residuals decreased below 1 3 10 1 it was possible to increase the values of the relaxation parameters to α i 0 80 and α e 0 03 these two regions are clearly visible in fig 3b due to the sudden increase in the iterative convergence rate of the solutions such initialisation period required 39 493 iterations for the sst 54 294 for the earsm and 70 491 for the rsm the convergence history of the residuals also shows that the earsm and rsm require a larger number of iterations than the sst closure yet the simple comparison of the number of iterations of each closure without examining the predicted flow features may lead to misleading conclusions about the robustness and cost of the simulations therefore the major conclusion that can be drawn from fig 3 for now is the fact that the rsm closure is sufficiently robust to simulate the selected complex flow configurations the cost of the simulations is addressed later 4 results and discussion the ability of the selected rans closures to predict the flow problems described in section 3 is now evaluated towards this end numerical and modelling errors are quantified for various quantities of engineering interest with the magnitude of the round off and iterative errors reduced to negligible levels when compared to the discretization error the results presented in this section are obtained in the finest resolution of each grid set since these lead to the lowest numerical errors the remainder grid solutions are used to estimate the numerical uncertainty u n φ through the method proposed by eça and hoekstra 2014 based on grid refinement studies and to illustrate the grid sensitivity of the results the modelling error on the other hand is quantified through the comparison error e c φ defined as the difference between the predicted φ and experimental value φ e and with the multivariate metric r r ref hills 2006 the american society of m 2016 for local flow quantities in n locations 23 r r ref i n e c φ i 2 u v φ i 2 n 2 n in equation 23 i is the index of a given point and u v φ is the validation uncertainty defined as u v φ u n φ 2 u e φ e 2 note that the former expression assumes that the input uncertainty is zero and that the numerical u n φ and experimental u e φ e uncertainties are uncorrelated the value of r r ref gives a quantitative measurement of the discrepancies between simulations and experiments it can be interpreted in the following manner values of r r ref larger than unity indicate that the overall comparison error exceeds the level of the validation uncertainty while r r ref below one represents the opposite a complete description of this validation technique is found in supplement 1 of asme v v 20 2009 report the american society of m 2016 the present section starts by discussing the results for each flow problem sections 4 1 to 4 3 it concludes in section 4 4 with the evaluation of the computations cost all the analysed quantities are normalised by v ρ and the reference length scale c or l p p 4 1 wingtip vortex flow the prediction of wingtip vortex flows is a challenging problem of fluid mechanics for both numerical and modelling reasons whereas the steep velocity and pressure gradients observed at the core of such vortical structures require high quality discretization techniques to diminish the discretization error the phenomena of solid body rotation and low intensity turbulence occurring at the inner core of wingtip vortices pose difficulties to turbulence modelling this stems from the traditional use of rans with closures based on the boussinesq hypothesis which are inadequate to predict curvature and rotation effects srs methods on the other hand have the potential to improve the predictions accuracy but their correct application may reveal excessively demanding and complex for statistically steady flows of industrial interest this has been recently discussed in pereira et al 2019c the importance of the first aspect is shown in table 1 and fig 4 referring to table 1 the predicted friction c f and pressure c d and c l coefficients indicate that the numerical uncertainty associated with their calculation is relatively small in fact the estimates for the numerical uncertainty do not exceed 2 6 of the predicted value for c f and 1 2 for the pressure coefficients these results indicate that the current grid resolution is adequate for the calculation of such integral quantities on the other hand the predictions of the pressure coefficient at the wingtip vortex centre presented in fig 4 exhibit a much stronger dependence on the grid resolution which is clearly influenced by the selected closure whereas the differences between solutions obtained in grids g 7 n c 6 993 936 and g 1 n c 55 951 239 are negligible for the sst model the rsm closure has a much larger dependence on the grid resolution in this case the pressure coefficient at x 1 c 1 4 experiences a monotonic reduction of approximately 1 02 from grids g 10 to g 7 r 2 0 and 0 67 from g 7 to g 1 r 2 0 furthermore solely the three finest grids seem adequate for rsm computations since only these resolutions lead to reduced variations upon grid refinement regarding the earsm the simulations exhibit two distinct trends i upstream of the trailing edge x 1 c 0 74 the earsm solutions experience a grid dependence similar to the rsm and ii in the near wake the earsm solutions show significantly smaller differences with the spatial resolution than the rsm for example the discrepancies observed between grids g 5 n c 16 542 464 and g 1 are smaller than those obtained between grids g 3 and g 1 with rsm fig 4 also highlights the importance of grid refinement studies verification exercises in the evaluation of mathematical models since the three closures lead to similar solutions in the coarsest grids due to discretization errors the results depicted in fig 4 have shown the relevance of the discretization strategy to the accuracy of the simulations they also indicate that the rsm is more demanding than the remainder closures owing to a larger dependence on the grid resolution yet solely this closure strategy maintains an approximately constant pressure coefficient at the wingtip vortex centre in the wake region x 1 c 0 74 this feature indicates that the rsm predicts a stronger and longer wingtip vortex which leads to steeper velocity gradients and inevitably to larger numerical requisites the differences in magnitude and length between the three closures are further illustrated in fig 5 where the magnitude of the pressure coefficient is depicted at various cross sections of the wingtip vortex the qualitative comparison of the three closures with the experimental measurements of chow et al 1997 shows a rapid diffusion of the wingtip vortex downstream the trailing edge by the sst and earsm closures the rsm does not exhibit the former behaviour instead achieving a good agreement with the experiments this is clearly illustrated by fig 6 such figure also shows that the sst closure leads to the largest comparison errors in both the wing and wake regions for instance the magnitude of the comparison error at x 1 c 1 4 is 2 7 for the sst while for the rsm is 0 2 0 1 using the predicted vortex centre pereira et al 2019c note that at such location the experimental value is approximately 3 6 similar to the grid requisites the earsm exhibits two distinct behaviours i a reasonable agreement with the experiments upstream the trailing edge which is comparable to that obtained by the rsm closure this trend is also evident in fig 7 where the pressure coefficient on wing s surface is depicted at two cross sections of the wing and ii large comparison errors downstream the trailing edge owing to a rapid diffusion of the vortex responsible for the increase of the pressure coefficient the previous conclusions are supported by the outcome of the quantification of the modelling error based on the multivariate metric r r ref table 2 in this case the ten locations with available experimental measurements see fig 6 are used to determine r r ref the values of r r ref reflect the decrease in modelling error from sst to rsm solutions observed in fig 6 whereas the value of r r ref reaches 9 5 for the sst and 5 5 for the earsm the rsm closure decreases this value to 2 6 furthermore such value reduces to 1 0 when the pressure coefficient obtained at the predicted wingtip vortex centre is used instead of that measured experimentally 4 2 kvlcc2 at r e 4 60 10 6 the second test case is the flow around the kvlcc2 tanker at model scale this benchmark case of ship hydrodynamics poses various difficulties to turbulence modelling owing to its complex geometry and the development of multiple vortical structures such as the bilge vortex these features and availability of experimental measurements are the reason for its selection and popularity in numerical ship hydrodynamics larsson et al 2002 larsson et al 2010 hino 2005 simman 2008 simman 2014 simman 2019 table 3 presents the force coefficients predicted by the different rans closures along with the respective numerical uncertainty it is important to recall that the current computational domain replicates the experimental apparatus of lee et al 2003 for this reason the total resistance coefficient c t measured by kim et al 2001 in a towing tank is not used to estimate modelling errors owing to the reduced blockage coefficient 0 35 of such experiments the results of table 3 are therefore used to infer the influence of the closure strategy and grid resolution in the prediction of the force coefficients they show that the pressure c p friction c f and total c t c t c p c f resistance coefficients vary up to 11 3 7 8 and 6 1 with the closure sst results used as reference this confirms the importance of the turbulence model for the prediction of such integral quantities furthermore and similarly to the results of pereira et al 2017 the earsm predicts the lowest values of c f and c t referring to the numerical uncertainty the estimates shown in table 3 do not exceed 5 8 of the predicted pressure coefficient and 1 7 for the remainder coefficients along with variations inferior to 3 2 upon grid refinement from n c 764 544 to 47 612 928 these results point out the adequacy of the finest grid resolution to diminish the discretization error in such integral quantities naturally the reported numerical uncertainties and variation upon grid refinement increase for local flow quantities in general these may increase more than one order of magnitude fig 8 illustrates this tendency by depicting the observed changes in the streamwise velocity field v 1 at the propeller plane from the coarsest to the finest grid r 4 0 as well as from the intermediate n c 5 996 544 to the finest one r 2 0 the results indicate that the discrepancies between the finest and the coarsest grid resolutions may exceed 19 of the incoming flow velocity in the bilge vortex region whereas for a refinement ratio of 2 0 these do not exceed 10 the modelling accuracy of the three closures predicting the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy fields at the propeller plane is evaluated in fig 9 and table 4 as for the wingtip vortex flow the qualitative assessment of the results reiterates the difficulties of the linear turbulent viscosity closure to compute wake fields featured by steady coherent structures it is clear that the intensity and dimensions of the bilge vortex are underpredicted by the sst closure the earsm and rsm closures on the other hand lead to a better qualitative agreement with the experiments the comparison error of the streamwise velocity field at the propeller plane and particularly in the bilge vortex region seems smaller for both closures yet such idea is not supported by the quantification of the modelling error shown in table 4 in fact the multivariate metric achieves similar values for the modelling accuracy of the sst and earsm closures in prediction of the streamwise and vertical velocity fields as well as of the turbulence kinetic energy this is certainly a consequence of the overprediction of the bilge vortex core by the earsm see fig 9b at x 2 l p p 0 on the contrary the rsm obtains the lowest values for v 1 and k r r ref 2 3 and 2 6 respectively in regard to the transverse and vertical velocity fields the validation metric indicates that the comparison error exceeds by at least six times the validation uncertainty r r ref 6 0 for all closures nonetheless the following factors should be considered in the interpretation of the results since they may contribute to the magnitude of r r ref i the former two components of the velocity field possess small magnitudes and so they may exhibit large comparison errors due to small discrepancies in the measured and predicted location of the bilge vortex core ii the experimental asymmetry of the velocity and turbulence kinetic energy fields at the propeller plane is much larger than the reported experimental uncertainty pereira et al 2017 and iii the use of free slip instead of no slip boundary conditions at the lateral walls of the domain may be introducing input errors the latter aspect has been tested but the unavailability of details about the boundary layers at the inlet of the wind tunnel hampers its precise evaluation finally fig 10 depicts the iso surfaces of the q criterion hunt et al 1988 to illustrate the vortical structures of the mean flow field captured by the three closures the magnitude of such quantity is selected to match that used in fureby et al 2016 the results of the various closures exhibit two major features the first is the fact that all closures can capture the bilge vortex yet the earsm and rsm closures predict a stronger bilge vortex which is two times longer than that obtained by the sst the second aspect is the presence of two secondary and smaller vortical structures these vortices are located near the water surface plane and are also observable in fig 9 in the vicinity of the hull between the three closures the earsm predicts the longest and strongest secondary vortices whereas for the earsm these are visible for q 100 the rsm and sst closures require q 90 and 50 respectively 4 3 kvlcc2 at r e 2 03 10 9 one of the advantages of cfd simulations is the ability to perform full scale computations for this reason the final case used to evaluate the selected rans closures is the flow around the kvlcc2 tanker at full scale reynolds number r e 2 03 10 9 although the unavailability of experimental measurements precludes the estimation of modelling errors this flow problem has two main objectives i demonstrate that the rsm is sufficiently robust to simulate this high reynolds number case section 3 3 and ii discuss the effect of the closure strategy and reynolds number in the flow dynamics to accomplish the second goal the full scale simulations are compared with a new set of model scale computations these have been conducted in the finest five grids of pereira et al 2017 which are similar to those used at full scale and the prescribed inflow turbulence conditions are i 1 5 and ν t ν 0 1 constant ν t ν r e the outcome of this study is presented in tables 5 and 6 and figs 11 and 12 considering tables 5 and 6 the results show an expected and significant reduction of the magnitude of all force coefficients from model to full scale simulations although this behaviour decreases the magnitude of the discrepancies between closures at full scale the results exhibit larger percent variations whereas the variation of 0 23 in c t at model scale corresponds to 5 8 the difference of 0 14 at full scale represents 8 0 sst results used as reference on the other hand the values of the form factor defined below obtained with the three closures also experience a strong dependence on the reynolds number and closure note that this quantity is sometimes assumed independent of the reynolds number and it is used in industrial marine applications to extrapolate the total resistance coefficient from model to full scale it is defined as 24 1 k c t c f 0 where c f o is the friction resistance coefficient here obtained from the ittc friction line 8 international towing t 1957 1 1 see eça and hoekstra 2008 for a comparison of various friction line models 25 c f 0 0 075 log 10 r e 2 2 the results of the various closure strategies indicate that the form factor is not independent of the reynolds number by exhibiting a reduction from model to full scale which may reach 0 08 for the rsm it is important to stress that the decrease in the magnitude of the force coefficients and form factor cannot be solely explained by discretization errors since the magnitude of the numerical uncertainty is smaller than the reduction of the former quantities the effect of the reynolds number on the flow dynamics is also observed in the streamwise velocity field v 1 at the propeller plane fig 11 naturally the increase of the reynolds number leads to a reduction of the boundary layer thickness and consequently to a reduction of the intensity and dimensions of the bilge vortex however the bilge vortex obtained at full scale reynolds number is still strongly dependent on the selected turbulence closure this is further illustrated in fig 12 where the iso surfaces of the q criterion hunt et al 1988 with magnitude q 100 are plotted for both reynolds numbers and the three closures it is clear from model to full scale that the intensity and length of the bilge vortex reduce for the earsm and rsm closures conversely the length of the secondary vortices predicted by such models experiences a significant increase such behaviour is particularly visible for the rsm whereas at model scale the secondary vortices are not visible for q 100 the rsm closure leads to the longest structures at full scale this is an important scale effect since the magnitude and dimensions of such vortical structures may prove to be crucial for the evaluation of noise signatures or environmental impacts the sst on the other hand does not exhibit secondary vortices in both cases for q 100 and the length of the bilge vortex remains approximately constant 4 4 computing cost the results discussed in sections 4 1 to 4 3 have illustrated the modeling advantages of using second moment closure over turbulent viscosity models the evaluation of the selected closures is now completed with the examination of the computing cost of the simulations table 7 presents the computing time of the simulations for each flow problem and closure strategy independently of the test case the rsm requires longer computing times to achieve the prescribed iterative convergence criterion for instance such closure exceeds by 89 0 the computing cost of the sst for the kvlcc2 tanker flows for the case of the wingtip vortex flows grid g 3 the computing cost increases by a factor of thirteen yet and in addition to the flow features captured by the rsm such increase in computing cost is mostly caused by the longer wingtip vortex which moves the maximum residual to the outflow boundary on the other hand the computing cost of earsm is consistently between that of sst and rsm however the cost of earsm computations is similar to sst for the wingtip vortex flow while it is closer to rsm for the flows around the kvlcc2 tanker considering that the first test case leads to the largest discrepancies between earsm and rsm solutions such result suggests that part of the additional computing cost is a consequence of the flow features captured by each turbulence closure an additional manner to evaluate the computing cost of the three closures is to analyse the fraction of the computing time spent solving the rans momentum and pressure and turbulent transport equations this step is presented in fig 13 for each closure and flow problem the results of fig 13 show that most of the computing time is taken by the combination of the rans and turbulent equations exceeding 96 of the total time furthermore it can also be inferred that rans rsm consumes approximately twice the computational resources of rans sst resolving the turbulent transport equations most notably the computing time spent resolving the seven equations of such closure exceeds the time taken by the rans equations for the kvlcc2 tanker at full scale on the other hand the computational burden of the earsm stays once again between the sst and rsm closures for all cases despite the additional computational cost the robustness and modelling accuracy obtained with rans rsm for the present test cases have shown that such closure strategy can be attractive for industrial applications involving statistically steady problems and mean flow quantities naturally the application of srs formulations is also expected to enhance the predictions quality however the predictive use of srs methods is significantly more demanding and complex than rans rsm for statistically steady flows this stems from three main reasons i time dependent simulations srs computations are intended to resolve at least a portion of the turbulent field and so they are inherently time dependent for this reason srs calculations need adequate temporal resolutions time step along with sufficiently long simulation times to achieve a statistically steady mean flow i e to converge the flow statistics ii numerical requisites the numerical requisites spatio temporal resolution and iterative convergence criterion of srs methods are more demanding than rans owing to their ability to resolve turbulent fluctuations for instance considering the loosest values for typical les grid requisites chapman 1979 kravchenko et al 1996 choi and moin 2012 x t 130 x n 1 x s 30 the required grid for les computations of the kvlcc2 tanker at model scale should be of the order of 10 9 cells moreover note that these criteria are based on simple boundary layer arguments and do not consider the discretization technique this may further increase the grid requisites although the use of hybrid and bridging models may relax the numerical requisites it is not expected a substantial reduction that enables daily or routinely computations for most industrial applications pereira 2018 iii boundary conditions in statistically steady flows the features of the unsteady turbulent inflow conditions are crucial to the success of srs simulations these determine various phenomena such as turbulence transition or the dynamics of coherent structures however the exact information about the inflow conditions is usually not available hampering the precise application of srs methods the consequences of this aspect are discussed in breuer 2018 or pereira 2018 keating et al 2004 and tabor and baba ahmadi 2010 present overviews of available techniques to generate proper boundary conditions for srs methods however some of these methods might be difficult to apply in routine computations all these aspects make the application of srs methods substantially more expensive than second moment rans closures for statistically steady flows therefore rans rsm seems to be an efficient tool for such class of industrial applications 5 conclusions this work has investigated the advantages of using second moment rans closure to predict statistically steady flows of engineering interest contrary to linear and non linear turbulent viscosity models second moment closures calculate the individual components of the reynolds stress tensor from modelled transport equations this is expected to enable rans to better capture complex flow phenomena without the burden of srs models to accomplish the objective of this study the numerical and modelling accuracies of the rsm of eisfeld 2004 earsm of dol et al 2002 and sst menter et al 2003 closures have been quantified and compared for various flow quantities of three representative ship hydrodynamics problems the case of the wingtip vortex resulting from the flow past a rectangular wing with a naca0012 section at ten degrees of angle of attack and reynolds number 4 60 10 6 and the flows around the kvlcc2 tanker at model and full scale reynolds numbers r e 4 60 10 6 and 2 03 10 9 respectively the main conclusions of this study are the following the present rsm closure and its implementation enable the reduction of the iterative error to negligible levels for the selected flow problems recall that these include a case at r e 2 03 10 9 nonetheless the number of iterations to achieve a given residual with such closure is larger than for the remainder rans models in addition to the robustness of the closure the observed decrease in iterative convergence rate is attributed to the modelling accuracy of rsm which enables the model capturing complex flow features the grid density required by the rsm closure to reduce the discretization error to adequate levels is substantially larger than for the sst as for the iterative convergence robustness this increase of numerical requisites is also related to the flow features captured by the rsm closure the results of the rsm have shown an enhanced modelling accuracy to predict the selected flows and quantities in comparison to the turbulent viscosity closures the rsm reduces the modelling error leading to a significantly better agreement with the experimental measurements this is particularly visible for the wingtip vortex flow overall and despite the additional cost when compared to turbulent viscosity closures this investigation has shown that rans rsm closure can be sufficiently robust and accurate to predict the selected class of statistically steady flows of engineering interest thus the results suggest this modelling strategy as an efficient tool for industry where application can be further explored by its cfd practitioners acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the laboratory for advanced computing at university of coimbra for providing the hpc resources necessary to perform the present research 
22514,a plunging breaker propagates with different stages each of which induces a different force on structures in this study physical experiments of the different stages of a plunging breaker impacting a vertical cylinder are implemented in a wave flume the concept of decomposing the measured forces into quasi static forces and dynamic forces is adopted the method proposed by irschik et al 2004 using an fft filter and emd empirical mode decomposition is applied in the decomposition process then a new method with a continuous wavelet based filter is used that produces a more reasonable result subsequently the results of the measured forces the quasi static forces and the dynamic forces are analyzed by considering the different stages of the plunging breaker the results show the peak forces induced by the various stages of the plunging breaker are quite different prior to the overturning jet impinging the free surface the quasi static forces due to the various stages of the plunging breaker are approximately the same while the dynamic forces contribute to different strengths of the force oscillations and exhibit a similar response following the mixture of water with air the peak value of the quasi static force is no longer invariant but declines sharply keywords extreme waves plunging breaker stages wave structure interaction vertical cylinder impact force 1 introduction pile supported foundations are widely applied in coastal and offshore engineering including high pile wharves piers sea bridges offshore wind power plants and offshore oil gas platforms interactions between water waves and slender cylinders d l 0 2 d the diameter of the cylinders l the characteristic wavelength a basic element of many coastal and marine structures have attracted significant attention in the engineering community notably plunging breakers are more likely to produce slamming forces with a short duration and induce destructive loading on a cylinder wienke and oumeraci 2005 however the impact of plunging waves against a cylinder is a very complicated process including the sophisticated breaking process the strong nonlinear interaction between the waves and the cylinder and the response of the cylinder due to slamming forces therefore in the past half decades experiments often were conducted to study plunging waves impacting a single cylinder arntsen et al 2011 chan et al 1995 chen et al 2018 goda et al 1966 irschik et al 2002 wienke and oumeraci 2005 and numerical simulations have been implemented due to the rapid development of computational capabilities kamath et al 2016 marino et al 2011 mo et al 2013 to date the impact process induced by plunging breakers has not been fully deciphered plunging breakers propagate with spatial temporal variations both in the wave geometry and the wave kinematics thus the relative distance between the break point and the cylinder has an influence on breaking wave forces chan et al 1995 tested the pressures produced by different stages of a plunging wave on a vertical cylinder by shifting the cylinder to different spatial locations within the breaking region and then classifying five special stages from p1 to p5 indicated in fig 1 stage p1 is defined as the wave having an increasing forward wave front stage p2 is defined as when the wave front is nearly vertical stage p3 is defined when the wave crest is in a jet like form and impacts the cylinder and the stages when the wave tongue just impinges on the water surface as it strikes the circular cylinder and when it impinges the water surface prior to impact and then creates air bubbles are classified as stages p4 and p5 respectively the results of the pressure characteristics in their study showed great sensitivity to these five stages wienke and oumeraci 2005 changed the focusing points with the dispersive focusing method to generate different plunging wave stages and they found that the maximum measured force on a cylinder occurred during the stage in which the jet was curling down corresponding to stage p3 while the maximum slamming force occurred when the wave front broke immediately in front of the cylinder corresponding to stage p2 kamath et al 2016 used the numerical model reef3d to simulate different stages of periodic breaking waves impacting on a cylinder and the same numerical model was also applied in simulating solitary breaking waves with a cylinder chella et al 2017 both of their studies found a large influence of the wave break point on the breaking wave forces therefore the main goal of the present study is to gain insight into the wave forces exerted by the different stages of a plunging breaker in physical experiments to create the different stages of a plunging breaker impacting a circular cylinder two methods are usual one method is to repeatedly simulate a single plunging wave and shift the locations of the cylinder chan et al 1995 zhou et al 1991 the other method is to keep the cylinder location unchanged while adjusting focusing points using the dispersive focusing method hildebrandt 2013 irschik et al 2002 2011 wienke and oumeraci 2005 however a problem generated by the latter method is that these different stages are not representative of the same plunging wave due to nonlinear wave wave interactions baldock et al 1996 fernández et al 2014 in addition adjusting the focusing point causes different incipient breaking locations which will increase measurement errors when confirming the incipient break points especially when using visual analysis from images irschik et al 2011 therefore in the present study the former method of shifting the location of the cylinder is adopted in addition to the aforementioned experimental methods used to quantify forces associated with the different stages of a plunging breaker impacting a cylinder a specific method to process the measured forces is important irschik et al 2002 suggested that measured forces f measured can be considered as a superposition of a quasi static component f quasi static which can be well approximated by the morison equation and a dynamic component f dynamic which is related to the response of a cylinder due to slamming forces notably although the morison force can represent the quasi static force it is impossible to calculate the morison forces without knowing the sea surface elevation and it is also challenging impossible for ordinary wave gauges to measure the surface of a plunging wave with a downward curling tongue i e that has multiple ordinate values for one abscissa location and hence is multivalued therefore methods to obtain the quasi static and dynamic forces directly from the measured forces are needed wienke and oumeraci 2005 simply referred to the measured forces as quasi static forces when a plunging wave broke downstream of the cylinder hence the dynamic forces were the difference between the measured forces and the quasi static forces irschik et al 2002 proposed a method to extract the quasi static forces and the dynamic forces from the measured forces using the emd empirical mode decomposition developed by huang et al 1998 the emd method was used also by choi et al 2015 to eliminate the influence of cylinder vibration and by jose et al 2017 to process the breaking forces on jacket structures rather than using the emd method wavelet transforms which are a time frequency analysis method can provide local information torrence and compo 1998 and therefore may be viable to separate measured forces chen et al 2019 used the wavelet transformation based filter to separate quasi steady and slamming components from the measured pressures on a cylinder however until recently there were no studies to separate the breaking wave forces on a cylinder using the wavelet transform toward this end in this study both the emd and the wavelet transform are applied to separate the measured forces this paper is organized as follows following the introduction the experiments are described in section 2 decomposition methods are summarized briefly in section 3 the results of applying separation methods to experimental data are presented and discussed in section 4 finally some conclusions are given in section 5 2 experiments 2 1 experimental setup the experiments are conducted in a wave flume 22 m long 0 45 m wide and 0 6 m deep located at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology p r china a motor driven piston type wave maker is used to generate waves at one end of the flume the mean position of the wave maker is defined as x 0 a beach made with plastic horsehair is fixed at the end of the flume to help mitigate wave reflection the water depth h in the present study is set to 0 30 m a vertical plexiglass pipe 65 cm high 6 cm diameter d and 0 5 cm wall thickness is used as the test cylinder and is installed at the midpoint of the flume width its submerged end is sealed to not allow water within the cylinder a small gap of approximately 0 5 cm exists between the end of the cylinder and the flume floor the top of the cylinder is connected to a force transducer that is mounted below a track slide that allows the cylinder to be shifted along the flume once positioned it is clamped onto the rigid frame the experimental setup is depicted in fig 2 in the present experiments only integral inline forces and wave surface elevations are measured the force measurement is implemented using a force transducer manufactured by the yangzhou institute of electronic technology co ltd type kd42010 which is capable of recording forces to 15 n with an accuracy of 0 01 n the sampling rate is set to 500 hz the wave surface elevations are measured by a twg 600s system produced by techno service co ltd and include 11 capacitive wave gauges with an accuracy of 0 01 cm all wave gauges are sampled at 50 hz and are located along the flume as shown in fig 2 a denser arrangement of wave gauges g6 to g10 is present in the wave breaking region prior to and during the experiments both the force transducer and wave gauges are calibrated carefully notably for a plunging wave slamming forces can cause a cylinder to oscillation with its natural frequency in this study shock vibration tests also known as logarithmic decrement tests are first applied to the force measurement system with the cylinder in the operational water depth it is found that the natural frequency of the cantilevered cylinder is approximately 9 0 hz in the longitudinal x direction additionally a high speed camera manufactured by pco imaging technology co ltd type pco dimax s4 is used to determine the different stages of the plunging breaker in the present study the frame rate is set to 800 frames per second fps and the resolution is set to 1448 pixels 680 pixels as shown in fig 2 the camera is placed on one side of the flume perpendicular to the glass walls focusing on the wet surface of the glass wall closest to it to generate an improved image three halogen lamps with a maximum power of 1000 w each are placed along the other side of the flume and a sheet of parchment paper is attached there to change the approximate point light sources into a more uniform source in addition to provide an apparent visual contrast between the cylinder and the breaking wave surface the cylinder is painted black to reduce light reflection 2 2 wave generation a pre determined plunging wave with a constant steepness spectrum is generated repeatedly by the dispersive focusing method baldock et al 1996 ning et al 2009 fernández et al 2014 liu et al 2016 the wave group is composed of 64 sinusoidal wave components with uniform frequency intervals ranging from 0 3 hz to 2 0 hz the pre defined focused location is x 9 30 m the linear summation of the amplitudes and the steepness of all the components are a i 12 12 cm and a i k i 0 48 respectively a i is the wave amplitude of the ith wave component k i is the wave number of the ith wave component given by the linear wave dispersion relation the wave front breaks before the focused location as computed by linear superposition because of nonlinearity as the wave group evolves and also because the lowest frequency component corresponds to shallow water kh 0 34 generally waves break when the wave forward slope steepens and reaches a critical angle zhang et al 2017 in this study to conveniently analyze the plunging wave the incipient break point is defined as the time when the forward wave front becomes vertical bonmarin 1989 fig 3 shows images recorded of the wave front at x 9 00 m x 9 01 m and x 9 02 m by the high speed camera there is an apparent instability at the peak of the wave front and only a small part of the wave front becomes vertical in view of the slight change among the surfaces recorded at x 9 00 m x 9 01 m and x 9 02 m the location x 9 00 m is chosen as the incipient break point to quantify the plunging wave characteristics in the time domain in the breaking region five wave gauges g6 to g10 are placed at x 8 90 m 9 00 m 9 10 m 9 20 m and 9 30 m respectively with g7 placed at the incipient break point x 9 00 m fig 4 presents the averaged wave surface elevations and their deviations for each of the five wave probes in the breaker region seven repeated tests in the absence of the cylinder are conducted for each the parameter η max is the maximum surface elevation and the characteristic period t is the period from the preceding trough to the succeeding trough see fig 5 the extremely small deviations indicate the excellent repeatability of the wave generation system in the present study local wave parameters at the break point are adopted to nondimensionalize the results the local wave parameters applied here are depicted in fig 5 the wave height h is the vertical distance between the wave crest and the preceding wave trough as mentioned note that this figure shows the parameters as a function of time not space table 1 presents the wave parameters calculated from surface elevations recorded at the break point in the absence of the cylinder and based on the linear dispersion relation notably due to a small ratio of the cylinder diameter to the representative wavelength d l 0 04 the wave records used for calculation are measured in the absence of the circular cylinder 2 3 experimental cases in the experiments the plunging waves are generated repeatedly while the cylinder is shifted to different positions so that it experiences the different stages the position of the pile is given by x 0 as indicated in fig 2 in total 21 positions are chosen and the detailed information is listed in table 2 three shifting intervals between adjacent locations δs 1 5 cm δs 2 2 cm and δs 3 10 cm are selected corresponding to four special plunging stages a through d that give the 21 locations each experimental location measurement is repeated seven times these four chosen stages are sketched in fig 6 stage a is similar to stage p1 in fig 1 and is representative of the wave front continuing to increase without wave breaking while passing the cylinder stage b is similar to stage p2 and indicates that the wave forward face becomes vertical at the front of the cylinder and that the wave tongue strikes the cylinder at the wave crest elevation stage c is similar to stage p4 in which the plunging jet is curled down and impinges on the free surface at the cylinder face stage d is similar to stage p5 in which the wave breaks creating a strong spray of an air water mixture ahead of the plunged jet though stage p3 is not adopted as a special stage a small interval δs 2 is chosen from where the wave front face becomes vertical to where the breaker tongue impacts the free surface and includes the stages with the inclined wave tongue 3 decomposition methods 3 1 the fft emd method to separate the quasi static forces and the dynamic forces from the measured forces irschik et al 2002 proposed a method using emd the measured forces are decomposed into six imfs intrinsic mode functions and a residual the high frequency component imfs 1 4 are summed to represent the dynamic forces while the low frequency component imfs 5 6 along with the residual are assumed to be the quasi static forces subsequently to reduce the uncertainties due to an artificial selection of the standard deviation in emd irschik et al 2004 combined an fft fast fourier transform low pass filter and emd to estimate the quasi static forces fig 7 provides a sketch of this method in this method the upper limit frequency in the fft low pass filter is set to the natural frequency of the system and then the emd is conducted in only one shifting step thus eliminating the residual oscillation caused by the fft filter the shifting step is implemented by averaging the up and down envelopes of the filtered forces and the averaged forces are the residual of the emd which are considered the quasi static forces regardless only one shifting step connecting extreme points cannot detect the inflection points that are not exact extreme points thus causing rough force envelopes in separating the total forces fig 8 indicates the down envelopes connected by extreme points red dash line and by inflection points blue solid line respectively therefore in the present study after applying a low pass fft based filter 0 9 0 hz every imf of the emd should satisfy the two requirements proposed by huang et al 1998 an algorithm for these requirements is depicted in fig 9 and described as follows huang et al 1998 a find the upper envelope f 1 t and the lower envelope f 2 t from input force f t b calculate the mean value of the upper and lower envelopes m t f 1 t f 2 t 2 c calculate h t f t m t and find the upper envelope h up t and the lower envelope h down t from h t d if the mean values of h up t and h down t equal zero and the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings of h t are either equal or differ at most by one then h t is set to the imf otherwise assign h t to a new f t and return to a after we get the first imf the difference between the input force and its first imf is the filtered force which is considered the quasi static force this decomposition method is used in the present study and is abbreviated as the fft emd method 3 2 the wavelet transform method to process the dynamic response of an offshore wind turbine with three natural frequency modes de ridder et al 2011 applied an fft filter with different frequency bands in the present study considering the non stationary properties of the forces induced by the wave group the continuous wavelet transform is a better choice than an fft filter for obtaining the forces of different frequency bands li et al 2015 ma et al 2009 massel 2001 and this is demonstrated subsequently herein the wavelet transform is used as follows the continuous wavelet transform wt s of a time sequence x n can be defined as torrence and compo 1998 1 w t s τ n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate δt is the time interval n δt is the time τ n is the number points in the time series s is the wavelet scale parameter that can be interpreted as the reciprocal of frequency f 1 s ma et al 2009 and ψ is constructed from the normalized result of a mother wavelet function ψ 0 t such that ψ 0 t has unit energy at each s furthermore 2 ψ n n δ t s δ t s 0 5 ψ 0 n n δ t s where the mother wavelet ψ t is usually selected from the morlet wavelet and is defined as 3 ψ 0 t π 1 4 exp t 2 2 exp i ω 0 t here ω 0 is the central frequency of the wavelet and should be more than 6 0 to meet the admissibility condition farge 1992 in addition ω 0 controls the wavelet resolution of the morlet wavelet transform a larger ω 0 has an improved frequency resolution but a poorer time resolution in the present study ω 0 is set to 6 0 rad s subsequently the wavelet energy spectrum can be defined as 4 w s τ w t s τ w t s τ s therefore a wavelet filtered time series x n can be defined as 5 x n τ δ j δ t 1 2 c δ ψ 0 0 j j 1 j 2 r w s j τ s j 1 2 where δj is the scale factor which gives a finer resolution with a smaller value and is set to 0 125 for adequate resolution the range scales between j 1 and j 2 are selected to reconstruct the wavelet filtered time series and the threshold in frequency f j1 f j2 can be interpreted as f j1 1 s j1 f j2 1 s j2 c δ is the reconstruction factor a constant determined by eq 6 and eq 7 for each wavelet and w δ is the wavelet transform of a time sequence with a delta function at the time n 0 torrence and compo 1998 in the present study c δ is taken as 0 776 for the morlet wavelet when the central frequency ω 0 is chosen to be 6 0 torrence and compo 1998 6 c δ δ j δ t 0 5 ψ 0 0 j j 1 j r w δ s j s j 1 2 7 w δ s 1 n n 0 n 1 ψ ˆ s ω n in this method the measured forces are divided also into a low frequency part and a high frequency part the low frequency part is related to the quasi static force while the high frequency part is related to the dynamic force as the morison force can be used to represent the quasi static force irschik et al 2004 wienke and oumeraci 2005 the difference between the measured force and the morison force in the wavelet energy spectra can be used to choose the range scales for quasi static forces the method for calculating the morison force is presented next 3 3 morison equation deng et al 2016 applied the morison equation with the surface elevations measured by wave gauges to calculate freak wave forces on a cylinder this method is used in this study however it is not possible for conventional wave gauges to capture the surface elevation of a plunging wave with a curling tongue thus wave gauges g6 and g7 are located before the formation of the plunging jet first the measured wave elevations are decomposed into linear components by an fft procedure then the water velocities u i t z and the water accelerations u i t z of all the wave components are calculated using linear wave theory subsequently the morison force f morison t is calculated according to the following equation 8 f morison t f d t f m t ρ r c d i 1 n u i t z i 1 n u i t z π ρ r 2 c m i 1 n u i t z d z where f d t is the drag force f m t is the inertia force and c m and c d are the empirical inertial and drag coefficients respectively r is the radius of the cylinder for irregular waves calibration approaches such as the least squares fit to the force domain have been advanced for the constant drag and inertia coefficients isaacson et al 1991 raed and soares 2018 however these methods are inappropriate for a plunging wave because they cannot meet the assumptions inherent in the morison equation the variations in c m are given for different waves and it is suggested that 2 0 be used for a slender cylinder this is based on the potential theory mei 2005 mot 2013 therefore c m is set to 2 0 in the present study regarding to c d it is associated with the keulegan carpenter number kc u m t m d where u m is usually the maximum orbital velocity d is the cylinder diameter and t m is the period and the β number β re kc d 2 νt m where ν is the water kinematic viscosity sarpkaya et al 1982 in this study the wave phase velocity is chosen to represent u m because the water velocity at the wave crest is close to the wave phase velocity in the breaking region considering the application of the constant steepness spectrum in generating the wave the wave components with low frequencies will have more energy than those with high frequencies so a spectrally weighted phase velocity c ps and a spectrally weighted frequency f ps are adopted according to eq 9 and eq 10 drazen et al 2008 9 u m c p s c p s i a i 2 δ f i a i 2 δ f i 10 t m 1 f p s a i 2 δ f i f i a i 2 δ f i where c psi is the linear phase velocity of the ith component through the linear wave dispersion relation hence u m 1 49 m s and t m 1 36 s and thus β 2655 and kc 34 finally based on the results of sarpkaya et al 1982 c d is approximated as 0 8 and 1 8 fig 10 shows a comparison between the morison forces red dashed line and the measured forces black solid line only two cases are calculated for the morison forces for stage a x 0 8 90 m and stage b x 0 9 00 m as they are prior to the formation of jet like wave crest for a more convenient comparison the peaks of the morison forces and the measured forces are shifted in time as can be seen in fig 10 the morison predicted peak value and the oscillations following the peak are not surprisingly somewhat incorrect the lower peak value of the morison forces is due primarily to the poor prediction of the high nonlinearity of the velocity quadratic term and the omission of the slamming force deng et al 2016 moreover in reality the cylinder is elastic and will oscillate approximately at its natural frequency once the slamming force occurs which is called ringing chaplin et al 1997 faltinsen et al 1995 the morison equation does not consider the influence of the response of the cylinder due to slamming forces thus the oscillations after the peaks are not predicted the wavelet energy spectra of the morison forces are calculated according to eq 8 and the measured forces are shown in fig 11 the figure shows that the main difference between these spectra occurs at approximately t 0 s for the higher frequencies i e above 6 0 hz that is called band 2 herein this difference is due to the effect of the dynamic forces which includes the slamming forces and the response of the cylinder hence to obtain the quasi static force the range of the lower frequency band band 1 herein is selected artificially to be 0 6 0 hz and the dynamic force is then the difference between the measured force and quasi static force 4 experimental results 4 1 measured forces the measured forces of cases a 8 90 m through case d 9 60 m are presented in fig 12 the forces are shifted in time so that the primary peaks are aligned in time the figure shows that as x 0 increases close to the wave focusing point small fluctuations that occur before the maxima from t 1 4 s to 0 2 s decrease while the crests narrow this may be due mainly to the spatial feature of plunging waves generated by the dispersive focusing method in addition peak values vary for the different cases and once the maxima are reached a higher frequency oscillation occurs images for difference cases recorded by the high speed camera are presented in fig 13 the variations in peak values and the oscillations are analyzed in subsection 4 2 4 2 decomposition results the decomposition methods discussed above an fft based filter 0 9 0 hz combined with emd and a wavelet filter 0 6 0 hz are used to extract the quasi static forces from the measured forces the resultant frequency ranges differ and depend on which method is employed the results are shown in fig 14 compared to the measured forces the oscillations following the peaks are removed by these two methods regardless the forces determined from the edm method occur earlier and exhibit flatter and smaller peaks compared to the measured forces and the forces processed by the wavelet transform filter method notably the forces processed by the wavelet transform filter method are more consistent with the morison forces at x 0 8 90 m and x 0 9 00 m therefore the wavelet transform filter also does well in obtaining the quasi static forces in addition the phenomenon secondary loading cycle is observed in this study this phenomenon that a secondary oscillation appears after the main peak in the loading was observed first in the experiment of grue et al 1993 in this study this phenomenon is difficult to observe in the measured forces due to the response of the cylinder but it is more apparent in the quasi static forces which are shown in fig 14 all second peaks occur at the time between 0 16 s and 0 26 s except for the quasi static forces processed with emd method at x 0 9 00 m as the occurrence of the ringing event was associated with the presence of a secondary load cycle the decomposition methods above mentioned might be a way to separate the ringing phenomenon from the measured data and to observe the secondary loading cycles more easily based on the above results the measured forces the quasi static forces obtained by these two methods and the morison forces can be determined for the different stages fig 15 presents the variations of the peak values of these forces the horizontal coordinate x and the force f are non dimensionalized as follows 11 x x 0 x b r e a k i n g l 12 f f ρ g d h 2 where x breaking is the incipient break point and is set to 9 00 m l is the characteristic wavelength and is set to 1 37 m and g is the gravitational acceleration and is set to 9 81 m s2 as shown in fig 15 the small error bars for the measured forces indicate the exacting repeatability of the present experiments and when x changes from negative to positive the peak values of the measured forces first increase gradually to reach the maximum value for case c 9 28 m x 0 204 and then decrease sharply thereafter at the maximum value the image of the approximate stage case c 9 30 m is presented in fig 13 the plunging wave front is curling down but has not yet impinged on the free surface a similar trend has been observed in previous studies hildebrandt 2013 irschik et al 2011 kamath et al 2016 wienke et al 2000 in addition after case c 9 30 m x 0 218 there is a large void ratio mixture of water and air that necessarily includes the formation development and presence of air bubbles in the water this process presumably decreases the peaks due to high energy dissipation and reduced density of the mixture with regard to the quasi static forces in fig 15 the morison forces are basically the same as the results from the wavelet transform filter method but exhibit higher values than the results from the fft emd method and before x 0 218 x 0 9 30 m where the plunging tongue impinges on the free surface the results from the wavelet transform filter method approximately remain stable while the results from the fft emd method show greater fluctuation wienke and oumeraci 2005 assumed the quasi static force was a constant and was obtained before wave breaking quasi static forces are preferred to have a stable value as its name implies therefore the wavelet transform filter method is a better choice regarding the quasi static forces in addition beyond x 0 218 the water and the air mix strongly see fig 13 and as with the measured forces there is also a decline in the quasi static forces thus the quasi static force remains approximately constant until the wave front face impinges on the free surface fig 16 presents the time series of forces from the differences between the measured forces and quasi static forces of the wavelet transform filter method these forces are considered to be the dynamic forces as discussed previously that include the response of the cylinder in fig 16 the force oscillations are apparent and are omnipresent as is evident the oscillation strength increases from case a 8 90 m to case c 9 30 m representing an increased strength of the ringing of the cylinder wienke and oumeraci 2005 noted that the maximum slamming force occurred when the wave broke immediately in front of the cylinder however in the present study the largest oscillation did not occur for the case b 9 00 m where the wave front was nearly vertical but occurred when the wave tongue curled down immediately prior to impacting the free surface the most likely reason for this difference is there is only a small vertical part of the wave front at the breaking location in the present experiment fig 3 allowing a large part of the wave front to impact the cylinder at an angle presumably this alters the phase of the maximum slamming force although different stages of the plunging breaker cause different ringing strengths the oscillations show a similar pattern this is due mainly to the use of a constant frequency ratio cylinder natural frequency to wave frequency in the present study chaplin et al 1997 found that different frequency ratios could affect the response of the cylinder to present the oscillations clearly the dynamic force of case 9 10 m is shown in fig 17 the force is non dimensionalized by the maximum absolute value and a theoretical damping oscillation irschik et al 2004 described by eq 13 is included as a comparison in this equation parameter f p is the peak frequency in the dynamic force and is thus set to 10 hz this value is slightly larger than 9 0 hz the natural frequency of the cylinder in still water because the natural frequency of the pile is a function of the immersed part of the cylinder γ is the damping factor and is selected as 0 064 to fit the dynamic force the results show that the forces of case 9 10 m fit well with the calculated results at first and then a discrepancy appears in phase possibly due to the change in the immersed portion of the cylinder 13 f t f max e γ 2 π f p t cos 2 π f p t 5 conclusions experiments on different stages of a plunging breaker impacting a vertical cylinder have been conducted in finite water depth to examine the wave forces induced by different stages phases of the plunging breaker the vertical cylinder is shifted to different positions along the wave flume while a pre determined plunging wave is generated repeatedly and precisely a decomposition concept for wave forces is adopted that assumes that measured forces induced by plunging waves can be separated into quasi static forces which can be well predicted by the morison equation and dynamic forces which are related to the ringing of the piling two decomposition methods are applied in this study one method is that proposed by irschik et al 2004 which uses an fft filter and emd additionally a new decomposition method that uses a wavelet based filter is implemented to separate the total forces the morison equation is also applied to predict the quasi static forces before wave breaking through comparison among the morison forces and the quasi static forces obtained from the wavelet transform filter method and the fft filter with emd method the results demonstrate that the quasi static forces obtained from the wavelet transform filter method are more consistent with those of the morison calculated forces moreover the peak values of the measured total forces the morison forces and the quasi static forces of these two decomposition methods are derived and analyzed for the various stages of the plunging breaker the results reveal that the maximum peak values of the total forces correspond to the wave shape when the crest is curling down but not quite impinging on the free surface additionally the peak values of the quasi static forces from the wavelet transform filter method are approximately constant until the wave front impinges on the free surface while the results from the fft filter with emd method exhibit greater fluctuations therefore the wavelet transform filter method appears to be a better choice for separating the forces notably the quasi static force is not invariant following the occurrence of a high void ratio mixture of water and air the peak value of the quasi static forces declines sharply as does the measured force furthermore the differences between the measured forces and the quasi static forces which are considered to be the dynamic forces are analyzed different strengths of oscillations in the dynamic forces depend on the stage of the plunging breakers although all oscillations show a similar pattern acknowledgment this research is supported financially by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51720105010 51679031 and liaoning

22514,a plunging breaker propagates with different stages each of which induces a different force on structures in this study physical experiments of the different stages of a plunging breaker impacting a vertical cylinder are implemented in a wave flume the concept of decomposing the measured forces into quasi static forces and dynamic forces is adopted the method proposed by irschik et al 2004 using an fft filter and emd empirical mode decomposition is applied in the decomposition process then a new method with a continuous wavelet based filter is used that produces a more reasonable result subsequently the results of the measured forces the quasi static forces and the dynamic forces are analyzed by considering the different stages of the plunging breaker the results show the peak forces induced by the various stages of the plunging breaker are quite different prior to the overturning jet impinging the free surface the quasi static forces due to the various stages of the plunging breaker are approximately the same while the dynamic forces contribute to different strengths of the force oscillations and exhibit a similar response following the mixture of water with air the peak value of the quasi static force is no longer invariant but declines sharply keywords extreme waves plunging breaker stages wave structure interaction vertical cylinder impact force 1 introduction pile supported foundations are widely applied in coastal and offshore engineering including high pile wharves piers sea bridges offshore wind power plants and offshore oil gas platforms interactions between water waves and slender cylinders d l 0 2 d the diameter of the cylinders l the characteristic wavelength a basic element of many coastal and marine structures have attracted significant attention in the engineering community notably plunging breakers are more likely to produce slamming forces with a short duration and induce destructive loading on a cylinder wienke and oumeraci 2005 however the impact of plunging waves against a cylinder is a very complicated process including the sophisticated breaking process the strong nonlinear interaction between the waves and the cylinder and the response of the cylinder due to slamming forces therefore in the past half decades experiments often were conducted to study plunging waves impacting a single cylinder arntsen et al 2011 chan et al 1995 chen et al 2018 goda et al 1966 irschik et al 2002 wienke and oumeraci 2005 and numerical simulations have been implemented due to the rapid development of computational capabilities kamath et al 2016 marino et al 2011 mo et al 2013 to date the impact process induced by plunging breakers has not been fully deciphered plunging breakers propagate with spatial temporal variations both in the wave geometry and the wave kinematics thus the relative distance between the break point and the cylinder has an influence on breaking wave forces chan et al 1995 tested the pressures produced by different stages of a plunging wave on a vertical cylinder by shifting the cylinder to different spatial locations within the breaking region and then classifying five special stages from p1 to p5 indicated in fig 1 stage p1 is defined as the wave having an increasing forward wave front stage p2 is defined as when the wave front is nearly vertical stage p3 is defined when the wave crest is in a jet like form and impacts the cylinder and the stages when the wave tongue just impinges on the water surface as it strikes the circular cylinder and when it impinges the water surface prior to impact and then creates air bubbles are classified as stages p4 and p5 respectively the results of the pressure characteristics in their study showed great sensitivity to these five stages wienke and oumeraci 2005 changed the focusing points with the dispersive focusing method to generate different plunging wave stages and they found that the maximum measured force on a cylinder occurred during the stage in which the jet was curling down corresponding to stage p3 while the maximum slamming force occurred when the wave front broke immediately in front of the cylinder corresponding to stage p2 kamath et al 2016 used the numerical model reef3d to simulate different stages of periodic breaking waves impacting on a cylinder and the same numerical model was also applied in simulating solitary breaking waves with a cylinder chella et al 2017 both of their studies found a large influence of the wave break point on the breaking wave forces therefore the main goal of the present study is to gain insight into the wave forces exerted by the different stages of a plunging breaker in physical experiments to create the different stages of a plunging breaker impacting a circular cylinder two methods are usual one method is to repeatedly simulate a single plunging wave and shift the locations of the cylinder chan et al 1995 zhou et al 1991 the other method is to keep the cylinder location unchanged while adjusting focusing points using the dispersive focusing method hildebrandt 2013 irschik et al 2002 2011 wienke and oumeraci 2005 however a problem generated by the latter method is that these different stages are not representative of the same plunging wave due to nonlinear wave wave interactions baldock et al 1996 fernández et al 2014 in addition adjusting the focusing point causes different incipient breaking locations which will increase measurement errors when confirming the incipient break points especially when using visual analysis from images irschik et al 2011 therefore in the present study the former method of shifting the location of the cylinder is adopted in addition to the aforementioned experimental methods used to quantify forces associated with the different stages of a plunging breaker impacting a cylinder a specific method to process the measured forces is important irschik et al 2002 suggested that measured forces f measured can be considered as a superposition of a quasi static component f quasi static which can be well approximated by the morison equation and a dynamic component f dynamic which is related to the response of a cylinder due to slamming forces notably although the morison force can represent the quasi static force it is impossible to calculate the morison forces without knowing the sea surface elevation and it is also challenging impossible for ordinary wave gauges to measure the surface of a plunging wave with a downward curling tongue i e that has multiple ordinate values for one abscissa location and hence is multivalued therefore methods to obtain the quasi static and dynamic forces directly from the measured forces are needed wienke and oumeraci 2005 simply referred to the measured forces as quasi static forces when a plunging wave broke downstream of the cylinder hence the dynamic forces were the difference between the measured forces and the quasi static forces irschik et al 2002 proposed a method to extract the quasi static forces and the dynamic forces from the measured forces using the emd empirical mode decomposition developed by huang et al 1998 the emd method was used also by choi et al 2015 to eliminate the influence of cylinder vibration and by jose et al 2017 to process the breaking forces on jacket structures rather than using the emd method wavelet transforms which are a time frequency analysis method can provide local information torrence and compo 1998 and therefore may be viable to separate measured forces chen et al 2019 used the wavelet transformation based filter to separate quasi steady and slamming components from the measured pressures on a cylinder however until recently there were no studies to separate the breaking wave forces on a cylinder using the wavelet transform toward this end in this study both the emd and the wavelet transform are applied to separate the measured forces this paper is organized as follows following the introduction the experiments are described in section 2 decomposition methods are summarized briefly in section 3 the results of applying separation methods to experimental data are presented and discussed in section 4 finally some conclusions are given in section 5 2 experiments 2 1 experimental setup the experiments are conducted in a wave flume 22 m long 0 45 m wide and 0 6 m deep located at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology p r china a motor driven piston type wave maker is used to generate waves at one end of the flume the mean position of the wave maker is defined as x 0 a beach made with plastic horsehair is fixed at the end of the flume to help mitigate wave reflection the water depth h in the present study is set to 0 30 m a vertical plexiglass pipe 65 cm high 6 cm diameter d and 0 5 cm wall thickness is used as the test cylinder and is installed at the midpoint of the flume width its submerged end is sealed to not allow water within the cylinder a small gap of approximately 0 5 cm exists between the end of the cylinder and the flume floor the top of the cylinder is connected to a force transducer that is mounted below a track slide that allows the cylinder to be shifted along the flume once positioned it is clamped onto the rigid frame the experimental setup is depicted in fig 2 in the present experiments only integral inline forces and wave surface elevations are measured the force measurement is implemented using a force transducer manufactured by the yangzhou institute of electronic technology co ltd type kd42010 which is capable of recording forces to 15 n with an accuracy of 0 01 n the sampling rate is set to 500 hz the wave surface elevations are measured by a twg 600s system produced by techno service co ltd and include 11 capacitive wave gauges with an accuracy of 0 01 cm all wave gauges are sampled at 50 hz and are located along the flume as shown in fig 2 a denser arrangement of wave gauges g6 to g10 is present in the wave breaking region prior to and during the experiments both the force transducer and wave gauges are calibrated carefully notably for a plunging wave slamming forces can cause a cylinder to oscillation with its natural frequency in this study shock vibration tests also known as logarithmic decrement tests are first applied to the force measurement system with the cylinder in the operational water depth it is found that the natural frequency of the cantilevered cylinder is approximately 9 0 hz in the longitudinal x direction additionally a high speed camera manufactured by pco imaging technology co ltd type pco dimax s4 is used to determine the different stages of the plunging breaker in the present study the frame rate is set to 800 frames per second fps and the resolution is set to 1448 pixels 680 pixels as shown in fig 2 the camera is placed on one side of the flume perpendicular to the glass walls focusing on the wet surface of the glass wall closest to it to generate an improved image three halogen lamps with a maximum power of 1000 w each are placed along the other side of the flume and a sheet of parchment paper is attached there to change the approximate point light sources into a more uniform source in addition to provide an apparent visual contrast between the cylinder and the breaking wave surface the cylinder is painted black to reduce light reflection 2 2 wave generation a pre determined plunging wave with a constant steepness spectrum is generated repeatedly by the dispersive focusing method baldock et al 1996 ning et al 2009 fernández et al 2014 liu et al 2016 the wave group is composed of 64 sinusoidal wave components with uniform frequency intervals ranging from 0 3 hz to 2 0 hz the pre defined focused location is x 9 30 m the linear summation of the amplitudes and the steepness of all the components are a i 12 12 cm and a i k i 0 48 respectively a i is the wave amplitude of the ith wave component k i is the wave number of the ith wave component given by the linear wave dispersion relation the wave front breaks before the focused location as computed by linear superposition because of nonlinearity as the wave group evolves and also because the lowest frequency component corresponds to shallow water kh 0 34 generally waves break when the wave forward slope steepens and reaches a critical angle zhang et al 2017 in this study to conveniently analyze the plunging wave the incipient break point is defined as the time when the forward wave front becomes vertical bonmarin 1989 fig 3 shows images recorded of the wave front at x 9 00 m x 9 01 m and x 9 02 m by the high speed camera there is an apparent instability at the peak of the wave front and only a small part of the wave front becomes vertical in view of the slight change among the surfaces recorded at x 9 00 m x 9 01 m and x 9 02 m the location x 9 00 m is chosen as the incipient break point to quantify the plunging wave characteristics in the time domain in the breaking region five wave gauges g6 to g10 are placed at x 8 90 m 9 00 m 9 10 m 9 20 m and 9 30 m respectively with g7 placed at the incipient break point x 9 00 m fig 4 presents the averaged wave surface elevations and their deviations for each of the five wave probes in the breaker region seven repeated tests in the absence of the cylinder are conducted for each the parameter η max is the maximum surface elevation and the characteristic period t is the period from the preceding trough to the succeeding trough see fig 5 the extremely small deviations indicate the excellent repeatability of the wave generation system in the present study local wave parameters at the break point are adopted to nondimensionalize the results the local wave parameters applied here are depicted in fig 5 the wave height h is the vertical distance between the wave crest and the preceding wave trough as mentioned note that this figure shows the parameters as a function of time not space table 1 presents the wave parameters calculated from surface elevations recorded at the break point in the absence of the cylinder and based on the linear dispersion relation notably due to a small ratio of the cylinder diameter to the representative wavelength d l 0 04 the wave records used for calculation are measured in the absence of the circular cylinder 2 3 experimental cases in the experiments the plunging waves are generated repeatedly while the cylinder is shifted to different positions so that it experiences the different stages the position of the pile is given by x 0 as indicated in fig 2 in total 21 positions are chosen and the detailed information is listed in table 2 three shifting intervals between adjacent locations δs 1 5 cm δs 2 2 cm and δs 3 10 cm are selected corresponding to four special plunging stages a through d that give the 21 locations each experimental location measurement is repeated seven times these four chosen stages are sketched in fig 6 stage a is similar to stage p1 in fig 1 and is representative of the wave front continuing to increase without wave breaking while passing the cylinder stage b is similar to stage p2 and indicates that the wave forward face becomes vertical at the front of the cylinder and that the wave tongue strikes the cylinder at the wave crest elevation stage c is similar to stage p4 in which the plunging jet is curled down and impinges on the free surface at the cylinder face stage d is similar to stage p5 in which the wave breaks creating a strong spray of an air water mixture ahead of the plunged jet though stage p3 is not adopted as a special stage a small interval δs 2 is chosen from where the wave front face becomes vertical to where the breaker tongue impacts the free surface and includes the stages with the inclined wave tongue 3 decomposition methods 3 1 the fft emd method to separate the quasi static forces and the dynamic forces from the measured forces irschik et al 2002 proposed a method using emd the measured forces are decomposed into six imfs intrinsic mode functions and a residual the high frequency component imfs 1 4 are summed to represent the dynamic forces while the low frequency component imfs 5 6 along with the residual are assumed to be the quasi static forces subsequently to reduce the uncertainties due to an artificial selection of the standard deviation in emd irschik et al 2004 combined an fft fast fourier transform low pass filter and emd to estimate the quasi static forces fig 7 provides a sketch of this method in this method the upper limit frequency in the fft low pass filter is set to the natural frequency of the system and then the emd is conducted in only one shifting step thus eliminating the residual oscillation caused by the fft filter the shifting step is implemented by averaging the up and down envelopes of the filtered forces and the averaged forces are the residual of the emd which are considered the quasi static forces regardless only one shifting step connecting extreme points cannot detect the inflection points that are not exact extreme points thus causing rough force envelopes in separating the total forces fig 8 indicates the down envelopes connected by extreme points red dash line and by inflection points blue solid line respectively therefore in the present study after applying a low pass fft based filter 0 9 0 hz every imf of the emd should satisfy the two requirements proposed by huang et al 1998 an algorithm for these requirements is depicted in fig 9 and described as follows huang et al 1998 a find the upper envelope f 1 t and the lower envelope f 2 t from input force f t b calculate the mean value of the upper and lower envelopes m t f 1 t f 2 t 2 c calculate h t f t m t and find the upper envelope h up t and the lower envelope h down t from h t d if the mean values of h up t and h down t equal zero and the number of extrema and the number of zero crossings of h t are either equal or differ at most by one then h t is set to the imf otherwise assign h t to a new f t and return to a after we get the first imf the difference between the input force and its first imf is the filtered force which is considered the quasi static force this decomposition method is used in the present study and is abbreviated as the fft emd method 3 2 the wavelet transform method to process the dynamic response of an offshore wind turbine with three natural frequency modes de ridder et al 2011 applied an fft filter with different frequency bands in the present study considering the non stationary properties of the forces induced by the wave group the continuous wavelet transform is a better choice than an fft filter for obtaining the forces of different frequency bands li et al 2015 ma et al 2009 massel 2001 and this is demonstrated subsequently herein the wavelet transform is used as follows the continuous wavelet transform wt s of a time sequence x n can be defined as torrence and compo 1998 1 w t s τ n 0 n 1 x n ψ n n δ t s where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate δt is the time interval n δt is the time τ n is the number points in the time series s is the wavelet scale parameter that can be interpreted as the reciprocal of frequency f 1 s ma et al 2009 and ψ is constructed from the normalized result of a mother wavelet function ψ 0 t such that ψ 0 t has unit energy at each s furthermore 2 ψ n n δ t s δ t s 0 5 ψ 0 n n δ t s where the mother wavelet ψ t is usually selected from the morlet wavelet and is defined as 3 ψ 0 t π 1 4 exp t 2 2 exp i ω 0 t here ω 0 is the central frequency of the wavelet and should be more than 6 0 to meet the admissibility condition farge 1992 in addition ω 0 controls the wavelet resolution of the morlet wavelet transform a larger ω 0 has an improved frequency resolution but a poorer time resolution in the present study ω 0 is set to 6 0 rad s subsequently the wavelet energy spectrum can be defined as 4 w s τ w t s τ w t s τ s therefore a wavelet filtered time series x n can be defined as 5 x n τ δ j δ t 1 2 c δ ψ 0 0 j j 1 j 2 r w s j τ s j 1 2 where δj is the scale factor which gives a finer resolution with a smaller value and is set to 0 125 for adequate resolution the range scales between j 1 and j 2 are selected to reconstruct the wavelet filtered time series and the threshold in frequency f j1 f j2 can be interpreted as f j1 1 s j1 f j2 1 s j2 c δ is the reconstruction factor a constant determined by eq 6 and eq 7 for each wavelet and w δ is the wavelet transform of a time sequence with a delta function at the time n 0 torrence and compo 1998 in the present study c δ is taken as 0 776 for the morlet wavelet when the central frequency ω 0 is chosen to be 6 0 torrence and compo 1998 6 c δ δ j δ t 0 5 ψ 0 0 j j 1 j r w δ s j s j 1 2 7 w δ s 1 n n 0 n 1 ψ ˆ s ω n in this method the measured forces are divided also into a low frequency part and a high frequency part the low frequency part is related to the quasi static force while the high frequency part is related to the dynamic force as the morison force can be used to represent the quasi static force irschik et al 2004 wienke and oumeraci 2005 the difference between the measured force and the morison force in the wavelet energy spectra can be used to choose the range scales for quasi static forces the method for calculating the morison force is presented next 3 3 morison equation deng et al 2016 applied the morison equation with the surface elevations measured by wave gauges to calculate freak wave forces on a cylinder this method is used in this study however it is not possible for conventional wave gauges to capture the surface elevation of a plunging wave with a curling tongue thus wave gauges g6 and g7 are located before the formation of the plunging jet first the measured wave elevations are decomposed into linear components by an fft procedure then the water velocities u i t z and the water accelerations u i t z of all the wave components are calculated using linear wave theory subsequently the morison force f morison t is calculated according to the following equation 8 f morison t f d t f m t ρ r c d i 1 n u i t z i 1 n u i t z π ρ r 2 c m i 1 n u i t z d z where f d t is the drag force f m t is the inertia force and c m and c d are the empirical inertial and drag coefficients respectively r is the radius of the cylinder for irregular waves calibration approaches such as the least squares fit to the force domain have been advanced for the constant drag and inertia coefficients isaacson et al 1991 raed and soares 2018 however these methods are inappropriate for a plunging wave because they cannot meet the assumptions inherent in the morison equation the variations in c m are given for different waves and it is suggested that 2 0 be used for a slender cylinder this is based on the potential theory mei 2005 mot 2013 therefore c m is set to 2 0 in the present study regarding to c d it is associated with the keulegan carpenter number kc u m t m d where u m is usually the maximum orbital velocity d is the cylinder diameter and t m is the period and the β number β re kc d 2 νt m where ν is the water kinematic viscosity sarpkaya et al 1982 in this study the wave phase velocity is chosen to represent u m because the water velocity at the wave crest is close to the wave phase velocity in the breaking region considering the application of the constant steepness spectrum in generating the wave the wave components with low frequencies will have more energy than those with high frequencies so a spectrally weighted phase velocity c ps and a spectrally weighted frequency f ps are adopted according to eq 9 and eq 10 drazen et al 2008 9 u m c p s c p s i a i 2 δ f i a i 2 δ f i 10 t m 1 f p s a i 2 δ f i f i a i 2 δ f i where c psi is the linear phase velocity of the ith component through the linear wave dispersion relation hence u m 1 49 m s and t m 1 36 s and thus β 2655 and kc 34 finally based on the results of sarpkaya et al 1982 c d is approximated as 0 8 and 1 8 fig 10 shows a comparison between the morison forces red dashed line and the measured forces black solid line only two cases are calculated for the morison forces for stage a x 0 8 90 m and stage b x 0 9 00 m as they are prior to the formation of jet like wave crest for a more convenient comparison the peaks of the morison forces and the measured forces are shifted in time as can be seen in fig 10 the morison predicted peak value and the oscillations following the peak are not surprisingly somewhat incorrect the lower peak value of the morison forces is due primarily to the poor prediction of the high nonlinearity of the velocity quadratic term and the omission of the slamming force deng et al 2016 moreover in reality the cylinder is elastic and will oscillate approximately at its natural frequency once the slamming force occurs which is called ringing chaplin et al 1997 faltinsen et al 1995 the morison equation does not consider the influence of the response of the cylinder due to slamming forces thus the oscillations after the peaks are not predicted the wavelet energy spectra of the morison forces are calculated according to eq 8 and the measured forces are shown in fig 11 the figure shows that the main difference between these spectra occurs at approximately t 0 s for the higher frequencies i e above 6 0 hz that is called band 2 herein this difference is due to the effect of the dynamic forces which includes the slamming forces and the response of the cylinder hence to obtain the quasi static force the range of the lower frequency band band 1 herein is selected artificially to be 0 6 0 hz and the dynamic force is then the difference between the measured force and quasi static force 4 experimental results 4 1 measured forces the measured forces of cases a 8 90 m through case d 9 60 m are presented in fig 12 the forces are shifted in time so that the primary peaks are aligned in time the figure shows that as x 0 increases close to the wave focusing point small fluctuations that occur before the maxima from t 1 4 s to 0 2 s decrease while the crests narrow this may be due mainly to the spatial feature of plunging waves generated by the dispersive focusing method in addition peak values vary for the different cases and once the maxima are reached a higher frequency oscillation occurs images for difference cases recorded by the high speed camera are presented in fig 13 the variations in peak values and the oscillations are analyzed in subsection 4 2 4 2 decomposition results the decomposition methods discussed above an fft based filter 0 9 0 hz combined with emd and a wavelet filter 0 6 0 hz are used to extract the quasi static forces from the measured forces the resultant frequency ranges differ and depend on which method is employed the results are shown in fig 14 compared to the measured forces the oscillations following the peaks are removed by these two methods regardless the forces determined from the edm method occur earlier and exhibit flatter and smaller peaks compared to the measured forces and the forces processed by the wavelet transform filter method notably the forces processed by the wavelet transform filter method are more consistent with the morison forces at x 0 8 90 m and x 0 9 00 m therefore the wavelet transform filter also does well in obtaining the quasi static forces in addition the phenomenon secondary loading cycle is observed in this study this phenomenon that a secondary oscillation appears after the main peak in the loading was observed first in the experiment of grue et al 1993 in this study this phenomenon is difficult to observe in the measured forces due to the response of the cylinder but it is more apparent in the quasi static forces which are shown in fig 14 all second peaks occur at the time between 0 16 s and 0 26 s except for the quasi static forces processed with emd method at x 0 9 00 m as the occurrence of the ringing event was associated with the presence of a secondary load cycle the decomposition methods above mentioned might be a way to separate the ringing phenomenon from the measured data and to observe the secondary loading cycles more easily based on the above results the measured forces the quasi static forces obtained by these two methods and the morison forces can be determined for the different stages fig 15 presents the variations of the peak values of these forces the horizontal coordinate x and the force f are non dimensionalized as follows 11 x x 0 x b r e a k i n g l 12 f f ρ g d h 2 where x breaking is the incipient break point and is set to 9 00 m l is the characteristic wavelength and is set to 1 37 m and g is the gravitational acceleration and is set to 9 81 m s2 as shown in fig 15 the small error bars for the measured forces indicate the exacting repeatability of the present experiments and when x changes from negative to positive the peak values of the measured forces first increase gradually to reach the maximum value for case c 9 28 m x 0 204 and then decrease sharply thereafter at the maximum value the image of the approximate stage case c 9 30 m is presented in fig 13 the plunging wave front is curling down but has not yet impinged on the free surface a similar trend has been observed in previous studies hildebrandt 2013 irschik et al 2011 kamath et al 2016 wienke et al 2000 in addition after case c 9 30 m x 0 218 there is a large void ratio mixture of water and air that necessarily includes the formation development and presence of air bubbles in the water this process presumably decreases the peaks due to high energy dissipation and reduced density of the mixture with regard to the quasi static forces in fig 15 the morison forces are basically the same as the results from the wavelet transform filter method but exhibit higher values than the results from the fft emd method and before x 0 218 x 0 9 30 m where the plunging tongue impinges on the free surface the results from the wavelet transform filter method approximately remain stable while the results from the fft emd method show greater fluctuation wienke and oumeraci 2005 assumed the quasi static force was a constant and was obtained before wave breaking quasi static forces are preferred to have a stable value as its name implies therefore the wavelet transform filter method is a better choice regarding the quasi static forces in addition beyond x 0 218 the water and the air mix strongly see fig 13 and as with the measured forces there is also a decline in the quasi static forces thus the quasi static force remains approximately constant until the wave front face impinges on the free surface fig 16 presents the time series of forces from the differences between the measured forces and quasi static forces of the wavelet transform filter method these forces are considered to be the dynamic forces as discussed previously that include the response of the cylinder in fig 16 the force oscillations are apparent and are omnipresent as is evident the oscillation strength increases from case a 8 90 m to case c 9 30 m representing an increased strength of the ringing of the cylinder wienke and oumeraci 2005 noted that the maximum slamming force occurred when the wave broke immediately in front of the cylinder however in the present study the largest oscillation did not occur for the case b 9 00 m where the wave front was nearly vertical but occurred when the wave tongue curled down immediately prior to impacting the free surface the most likely reason for this difference is there is only a small vertical part of the wave front at the breaking location in the present experiment fig 3 allowing a large part of the wave front to impact the cylinder at an angle presumably this alters the phase of the maximum slamming force although different stages of the plunging breaker cause different ringing strengths the oscillations show a similar pattern this is due mainly to the use of a constant frequency ratio cylinder natural frequency to wave frequency in the present study chaplin et al 1997 found that different frequency ratios could affect the response of the cylinder to present the oscillations clearly the dynamic force of case 9 10 m is shown in fig 17 the force is non dimensionalized by the maximum absolute value and a theoretical damping oscillation irschik et al 2004 described by eq 13 is included as a comparison in this equation parameter f p is the peak frequency in the dynamic force and is thus set to 10 hz this value is slightly larger than 9 0 hz the natural frequency of the cylinder in still water because the natural frequency of the pile is a function of the immersed part of the cylinder γ is the damping factor and is selected as 0 064 to fit the dynamic force the results show that the forces of case 9 10 m fit well with the calculated results at first and then a discrepancy appears in phase possibly due to the change in the immersed portion of the cylinder 13 f t f max e γ 2 π f p t cos 2 π f p t 5 conclusions experiments on different stages of a plunging breaker impacting a vertical cylinder have been conducted in finite water depth to examine the wave forces induced by different stages phases of the plunging breaker the vertical cylinder is shifted to different positions along the wave flume while a pre determined plunging wave is generated repeatedly and precisely a decomposition concept for wave forces is adopted that assumes that measured forces induced by plunging waves can be separated into quasi static forces which can be well predicted by the morison equation and dynamic forces which are related to the ringing of the piling two decomposition methods are applied in this study one method is that proposed by irschik et al 2004 which uses an fft filter and emd additionally a new decomposition method that uses a wavelet based filter is implemented to separate the total forces the morison equation is also applied to predict the quasi static forces before wave breaking through comparison among the morison forces and the quasi static forces obtained from the wavelet transform filter method and the fft filter with emd method the results demonstrate that the quasi static forces obtained from the wavelet transform filter method are more consistent with those of the morison calculated forces moreover the peak values of the measured total forces the morison forces and the quasi static forces of these two decomposition methods are derived and analyzed for the various stages of the plunging breaker the results reveal that the maximum peak values of the total forces correspond to the wave shape when the crest is curling down but not quite impinging on the free surface additionally the peak values of the quasi static forces from the wavelet transform filter method are approximately constant until the wave front impinges on the free surface while the results from the fft filter with emd method exhibit greater fluctuations therefore the wavelet transform filter method appears to be a better choice for separating the forces notably the quasi static force is not invariant following the occurrence of a high void ratio mixture of water and air the peak value of the quasi static forces declines sharply as does the measured force furthermore the differences between the measured forces and the quasi static forces which are considered to be the dynamic forces are analyzed different strengths of oscillations in the dynamic forces depend on the stage of the plunging breakers although all oscillations show a similar pattern acknowledgment this research is supported financially by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51720105010 51679031 and liaoning
