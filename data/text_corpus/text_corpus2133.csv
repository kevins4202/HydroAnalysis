10665,this article analyses the drivers of adoption of irrigation systems by orange growers in the state of são paulo brazil given the scarcity of similar studies focusing on the brazilian orange sector the starting point of our article is the estimation of a translog production function to assess the impact of irrigation on the production of a sample of 98 são paulo s orange growers the results showed that irrigation adoption increased orange production of the farms in the sample by 21 9 ceteris paribus despite the potential benefits of irrigation adoption was rather low only 24 6 of the orange orchards area in the brazilian orange belt was irrigated in 2015 starting from this apparent paradox we argue that the information asymmetry and conflicts observed in the contractual relationship between growers and juice processing firms reduce the incentives for the adoption of technologies in the brazilian orange sector we apply probit models to the same sample to test four hypotheses on drivers of the decision to adopt irrigation the results of our empirical analysis show that the use of contracts in transactions with processing firms negatively affect the adoption of irrigation the analysis also identifies other variables that influence positively the adoption of irrigation participation in producers associations participation in courses on irrigation and dependence on the income from the orange orchard the results of this study suggest that the design of policies aimed at fostering irrigation adoption must consider potential bargaining power asymmetries in the relationships between the users of irrigation and the buyers of their agricultural production keywords contracts irrigation bargaining power technology adoption 1 introduction brazil produced 17 7 tons of orange in the market year 2017 2018 which represented around 34 of the world production united states department of agriculture usda 2019 according to the brazilian agricultural census almost 56 000 farms had orchards with at least 50 orange trees in 2017 ibge 2017 the brazilian orange production is clustered in the state of são paulo which produced 12 9 million tons in 2018 ibge 2018 around 80 of the são paulo s orange production is directed to the juice processing industry the remaining supply is traded in the fresh fruit market neves et al 2010 in the market year of 2018 2019 1 03 million tons of orange juice were produced in brazil a volume that represents more than half of the world production united states department of agriculture usda 2018 brazil is a major exporter of orange juice as well selling over 75 of the global orange juice exports united states department of agriculture usda 2019 several varieties of orange are cultivated in brazil to comply with quality requirements of the industry the most representative varieties are pera rio valencia valencia folha murcha hamlin westin and rubi among these hamlin is the only variety grown exclusively for the juice processing market citrus defense fund fundecitrus 2019 since the turn of the twenty first century several challenges have negatively affected the profitability of orange growers in the state of são paulo farmers have faced increasing production costs that result from the high incidence of pests and diseases such as greening and citrus canker moreover most brazilian orange growers sell their production to firms with a marked oligopsonistic position in the juice processing industry three brazilian firms dominate the orange juice export market accounting for 98 of the brazilian orange juice exports consequently growers are subjected to the considerable bargaining power accumulated by these large exporters ito and zylbersztajn 2018 farmers have limited alternative to sell their production given that the fresh fruit market is relatively small and orange demand is price inelastic in 2016 the brazilian economic defense administrative council cade approved the terms of a settlement in a cartel investigation against orange juice processors it was a long investigation which lasted for 17 years and resulted in a payment of 301 million brazilian real to cade it is also important to take into account that the orange market is characterized by high price volatility taken together these factors led a considerable number of orange growers to abandon the activity from 1996 2018 the number of orange growers in the state was reduced by more than 79 citrus defense fund fundecitrus 2019 given this challenging context the adoption of new practices and technologies in the orange orchards of the state of são paulo may contribute to a reduction of the rate of exit of the orange market in particular a growing research body has suggested that the adoption of irrigation can lead to a substantial increase of the productivity of orange orchards as well as improving fruit quality i e ratio of juice the weight and size of oranges petillo and castel 2004 duenhas et al 2005 given the scarcity of similar studies focused on the brazilian orange sector the starting point of our article is an estimation of a translog production function to assess the impact of irrigation on orange production a survey comprising 98 orange growers of the state of são paulo provided cross sectional data at the farm level for the crop season of 2013 2014 according our estimation irrigation increases orange production by 21 9 as showed in section 4 despite the potential benefits of irrigation only 24 6 of the orange orchards area in the brazilian orange belt comprised by são paulo and the southwest of the state of minas gerais was irrigated in 2015 fundecitrus 2015 starting from this apparent paradox this paper discusses the following research question what are the factors that explain the low diffusion of irrigation in the brazilian orange belt in order to accomplish this task we estimate probit models to analyse the drivers of adoption of irrigation systems from data of the same survey of 98 orange growers the nature of the transactions between orange growers and juice processing firms was examined as several authors describe conflicts among them in the brazilian orange belt are recurrent figueiredo et al 2013 ito and zylbersztajn 2016 carrer and souza filho 2018 in particular the considerable bargaining power held by juice processing firms allows them to design contracts and to explicitly manipulate the level of incompleteness of these agreements to capture a greater share of the quasi rent derived from orange transactions ito and zylbersztajn 2018 hence our main interest is in assessing how the existence of contracts between orange growers and juice processing firms affects the adoption of irrigation following acemoglu et al s 2007 contribution we argue that the information asymmetries and conflicts observed in the relationship between growers and juice processing firms reduce the incentives for the adoption of more advanced technologies in the orange sector see also ménard 2018 in the pages below we show that the use of contracts with juice processing firms in the commercialization of oranges reduces the likelihood of adoption of irrigation among the orange farms in our sample we also test other three hypotheses first the participation in producers associations positively affects the adoption of irrigation a result that suggests the importance of collective actions for the sharing of relevant information among farmers nevertheless we do not identify a significative influence of factors such as the access to credit and the use of management tools on irrigation adoption taken together these results suggest that the bargaining power concentrated in the hands of juice producers has contributed to the low rates of irrigation adoption in the brazilian orange industry 2 literature review and hypotheses the adoption of a technology occurs when an individual accepts to use and employs a new technology continuously feder et al 1985 whenever a technology is developed and introduced in the market adoption will be heterogeneous while some entrepreneurs will adopt the technology instantly others will postpone its adoption and a portion of potential users will never adopt it caswell 1991 in turn the diffusion of a technology is characterized by the aggregate adoption of a technology generally in replacement of an old technology used to solve the same set of problems within a population or area over time rogers 1962 early studies on technology diffusion have employed epidemic diffusion models which are based on the idea that diffusion depends on the reduction of the informational uncertainty related to the adoption of the technology griliches 1957 mansfield 1961 however researchers soon realized that the expected profits derived from adoption may vary depending on the features of the firm under consideration in response scholars have extensively analyzed how particular thresholds affect the economic benefits of use of a given technology a well known example is david s 1969 analysis of the drivers of adoption of mechanical grain reapers in the united states during the nineteenth century the study which employs a threshold model of technology diffusion showed that the size of the farm was a fundamental factor behind the adoption decision since farmers had to make a choice between manual methods with high variable costs and mechanical grain reapers a farm had to be large enough to take advantage of the potential economies of scale that derive from the adoption of the technology the introduction of threshold models has shifted the empirical analysis from the study of an aggregate adoption process to an individual decision making process in this sense threshold models assume that the adoption of a technology results from a profit maximizing or utility maximizing behaviour in a heterogeneous population of decision makers foster and rosenzweig 2010 carrer et al 2017 individuals will adopt a new technology if adoption increases the net revenue from production at the same time different preferences and other external factors will also affect the adoption of a technology galliano and orozco 2011 for instance the threshold model allows the identification of several factors that affect the adoption of a new technology at the individual level these insights can highly influence the formulation of public policies and private strategies accelerating the diffusion of a new technology geroski 2000 beyond david s threshold model basic tenets several studies assume the influence of other demand and supply factors on the decision of adopting a technology examples include factors such as the previous number of users of a technology reinganum 1981 economic learning and learning by using stoneman 1981 rosenberg 1982 risk attitudes kondouri et al 2006 salazar and rand 2016 and suppliers profits metcalfe 1981 while these contributions have enhanced our understanding of how innovation is adopted and diffused the progressive development of the literature has added complexity to empirical analyses in particular the inclusion of variables with dynamic properties has increased the amount of information to be collected and included in empirical models berger 2001 most studies that analyse the drivers of irrigation adoption use threshold models to identify a critical level of heterogeneity that would differentiate adopters and non adopters caswell 1991 this broad literature can be divided in three main strands the first strand studies the secondary adoption of irrigation that is the factors that lead farmers to replace their current irrigation system adopting more efficient ones fishelson and rymon 1989 dinar and yaron 1990 koundouri et al 2006 schuck et al 2007 in turn the second strand encompasses studies that identify the drivers of choice of one irrigation system over another in this strand researchers generally assume that the decision to adopt irrigation had already been made when farmers chose an irrigation system negri and brooks 1990 green et al 1996 moreno and sunding 2005 after all profit maximizer farmers will choose to use an irrigation system only if the technology is perceived to be more profitable than alternative options caswell and zilberman 1985 finally the third strand comprises contributions that assess the primary adoption of irrigation i e situations in which the farmer has never used irrigation and can choose whether to adopt the technology given the low diffusion of irrigation in the brazilian orange belt our hypotheses derive mostly from the theoretical and empirical developments of the primary adoption of irrigation strand of literature researchers highlight four categories that affect the adoption of irrigation during this stage of the decision making process i access and sharing of information ii technical and managerial skills iii the organizational and institutional environments and iv structural and agronomic aspects of the farm in the paragraphs below we derive hypothesis related to the first three of these four categories identified in the literature reflecting the fact that all the farms in our sample come from the same geographical region the results of our survey show similar structural and agronomic characteristics for each observation hence we do not include hypotheses related to this category in our empirical analysis yet we acknowledge that previous studies have analysed the influence of structural and agronomic aspects such as temperature and precipitation levels torkamani and shajari 2008 cunha et al 2014 cremades et al 2015 access to water sources e g he et al 2007 alcon et al 2011 singh et al 2015 soil type negri et al 2005 cremades et al 2015 and the access to infrastructure kulshreshtha and brown 1993 2 1 access and sharing of information information usually plays a fundamental role in inducing the adoption of a technology for instance the seminal contributions by griliches 1957 and mansfield 1961 associate the cumulative adoption of a technology over time with the progressive dissemination of information among its potential users more available information means an enhanced ability to evaluate the costs and benefits of adoption geroski 2000 galliano and orozco 2011 moreover the cumulative adoption of a technology may help farmers to understand how to operate it properly namara et al 2007 as geroski 2000 points out a technology has two aspects the hardware aspect i e the physical characteristics and the software aspect which is the amount of information that is needed to use it effectively since knowledge from an adopter s perspective is built up mainly from the experience of use of a technology it is reasonable to assume that the establishment of communication channels among farmers foster the transmission of information related to the software aspects of irrigation genius et al 2013 the literature identifies several mechanisms that support the diffusion of information on irrigation galioto et al 2020 following the widespread interest in understanding the relationship between the existence of extension programs and the adoption of a technology several studies show that farmers who interact with technical assistance staff are more likely to adopt irrigation systems he et al 2007 alcon et al 2011 cunha et al 2014 cremades et al 2015 ferreira 2015 zhang et al 2019 similarly training programs on the operation of an irrigation system may provide the necessary information e g practical demonstrations that would reduce the uncertainty related to the adoption of the technology finally interactions between user and non users of a technology can occur either because of geographical proximity or due to the membership to organizations such as associations and cooperatives vinholis et al 2016 other studies show that the members of farmers organizations receive more information positively affecting the likelihood of irrigation kulshreshtha and brown 1993 alcon et al 2011 hence we expect that hypothesis 1 the adoption of irrigation is positively affected by participation in agricultural associations 2 2 technical and managerial skills the appropriate operation of irrigation systems requires technical and managerial skills hence human capital and use of management tools matter anderson et al 1999 namara et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 studies show that the educational level of farmers positively affects the likelihood of adoption of a technology bagheri and ghorbani 2011 carrer et al 2017 from a farm management perspective education may be a necessary but an insufficient condition for an appropriate operation of the bundle of resources within the boundaries of the farm for instance the absorptive capacity of an organization i e the ability to recognize the value of a piece of information and use it to pursue economic gain depends on the establishment of appropriate organizational structures or the existence of know how see cohen and levinthal 1990 vinholis et al 2016 in the brazilian orange belt we expect that these capabilities should be supported by management tools that facilitate the gathering of information examples include the use of specialized software and the participation in certification systems that require the provision of relevant data the available evidence shows that these tools help to foster the adoption of innovations in farms bernard and fan 2004 therefore we expect that hypothesis 2 the adoption of irrigation is positively affected by the use of management tools 2 3 the organizational and institutional environments multiple organizational and institutional factors affect technology adoption and diffusion feder et al 1985 galliano and orozco 2011 in the literature dedicated to analysing the phenomenon in agricultural contexts the idea that farmers face a series of constraints to adopt new technologies is pervasive a commonly studied constraint with an institutional component is limited access to credit farmers from developing countries often cannot provide a collateral and therefore are unable to obtain credit the broad literature discussing how credit access affects technology adoption identifies several explanatory variables examples include factors directly related to the ability of a farmer to provide a collateral e g the size of the farm and the ownership of equipment and indirect factors such as community ties proximity between lenders and borrowers and the nature of the household relationships negri et al 2005 salazar and rand 2016 carrer et al 2020 irrespective of the driver of assess to credit however we expect that an enhanced ability to borrow resources from public or private organizations will increase the probability of adoption of irrigation ceteris paribus he et al 2007 alcon et al 2011 hypothesis 3 the adoption of irrigation is positively affected by access to rural credit finally we assess the role of contracts in the adoption of irrigation in the brazilian orange belt contracts are an important coordination mechanism in this sector vertical integration explains the supply of 40 of the oranges used by the brazilian juice processing industry with large volumes 60 being sold by independent growers forwards contracts that range from one to two years of duration are most commonly used in transactions between orange growers and processing firms spot market transactions are unusual in the juice processing market in the fresh orange segment however spot market transactions are the most common transaction in general growers sell fresh fruits to packinghouses which classify clean and distribute the oranges to both domestic retailers and foreign markets farmers may eventually have their own packinghouses scholars have long assumed that farmers are risk averse stiglitz 1974 a claim that is widely used in the empirical research giné and yang 2009 in this sense efficient contracts would balance the benefits from enhanced incentives and the costs from risk bearing meyer et al 1992 potentially fostering the materialization of investments in technology however the idea that risk preferences play a fundamental role in shaping contracts in agriculture is not consensual for instance allen and lueck 1995 use a transaction cost based framework to explain the adoption of contracts among farmers people are assumed to be risk neutral under a transaction cost based logic with the features of the contracts ensuing from an alignment between the characteristics of the transaction and the necessary instruments to enforce the exchange williamson 1987 hence fear of ex post expropriation of the gains derived from investments in specific assets becomes a driving force in the design of contracts klein et al 1978 despite these threats transaction cost based theorists tend to predict the design of contractual remedies that mitigate the probability of opportunistic behaviour allen and lueck 2002 nevertheless people are often unable to design contracts that secure investments in specific assets acemoglu et al 2007 show that a greater level of contractual incompleteness may disincentive a firm to adopt more advanced technologies given the frictions that may arise among the parties in other cases the design of relatively standardized contracts is insufficient for protecting the quasi rent derived from specific investments ménard 2018 furthermore new dimensions of market power such as the use of contracts to unilaterally impose restrictions on the actions of other parties have become more common in agri food supply chains see bonanno et al 2018 the brazilian orange belt illustrates this argument as ito and zylbersztajn 2016 point out orange juice processing firms from the state of são paulo hold a considerable ability to influence the selection of terms in the contracts with farmers the high barriers to entry in the juice processing segment limit the alternatives of commercialization for brazilian orange producers at the same time juice processing firms have pursued a strategy based on the vertical integration of part of their orange supply a move that has further increased their bargaining power ito and zylbersztajn 2018 the result is a pattern of continuous conflicts between juice processing firms and orange producers with a frequent use of power by firms to shape contractual obligations and capture a greater share of the total surplus generated in the agri food chain carrer and souza filho 2018 consequently we expect that brazilian orange farmers who sell to juice processing firms using contracts have lower incentives to adopt irrigation technologies hypothesis 4 the adoption of irrigation is negatively affected by the use of contracts with juice processing firms 3 materials and methods this article uses a mixed methods development approach greene et al 1989 in which a qualitative research inspires the creation of a survey that informs a quantitative analysis we applied our survey to a random sample of orange farms from the central southern and northern regions of the orange belt of the state of são paulo this state was responsible for 73 of brazilian orange production in 2018 the regions studied had 9370 agricultural production units with orange orchards and account for approximately 50 of this state s total orange production lupa 2017 simple random sampling was used to calculate the sample size with a sampling error of 10 and confidence level of 95 a sample with 98 farms was obtained 47 located in the southern 31 in the central and 20 in the northern region of the citrus belt the sample is divided in two groups 34 adopters of irrigation and 64 non adopters of irrigation we consider adopters the growers who had any type of irrigation system in any fraction of their orange orchards during the crop season of 2013 2014 face to face interviews with the orange growers were performed between march and september of 2014 the questionnaire was divided into three main blocks i personal characteristics of the orange farmers ii structural aspects of the production process iii aspects of the decision making process and individual perceptions on relevant institutional and economic factors the cross section data refers to 2013 14 crop year it is relevant to present some characteristics of the farms in the sample oranges are the main output of all sampled farms in addition to orange other crops were cultivated in some farms e g lemon sugar cane and cattle on average oranges were cultivated in 65 of the available agricultural land of these farms in 53 farms 54 of the total sample oranges were cultivated in 100 of their available agricultural land while in 45 farms other crops were cultivated as well adopters and non adopters of irrigation grow many varieties of oranges the adopters orange area consisted of pera rio 42 of the irrigated area valencia 29 hamlin 8 folha murcha 7 westin 4 and other varieties 10 while the non adopters grow pera rio 36 of the orange area valencia 31 hamlin 11 natal 1 folha murcha 7 westin 5 and other varieties 9 these distributions were not statistically different between the two groups all varieties with exception of hamlin could be sold in both fresh fruit market and juice processing market in fact 76 of adopters had sold their oranges in both markets and 24 in the fresh fruit market exclusively while 67 of non adopters had sold in both markets and 33 in the fresh fruit market exclusively our econometric analyses can be subdivided in two steps i translog production function estimation ii probit models estimation a flexible translog production function was estimated to measure the impact of irrigation as a technological change on orange production of the sampled farms the following specific form describes the proposed econometric model 1 l n y i β 0 β 1 l n x 1 i β 2 l n x 2 i β 3 l n x 3 i β 4 l n x 4 i β 11 1 2 l n 2 x 1 i β 12 l n x 1 i l n x 2

g a u i in which yi denotes the orange production of the i th firm xi is a vector of logarithms of physical quantities of inputs used by the farm land x1 in hectares labour x2 in hours capital x3 in machine hours and fertilizers x4 in kilo irriga is a dummy variable for irrigation adoption β is a vector of the parameters of the production function to be estimated δ is the shift parameter that captures the impact of irrigation adoption on the production function ui is a random error term independent and identically distributed and i denotes the i th of 98 farms in the sample the estimation of the parameter δ allows the quantification of the impact of the adoption of irrigation on orange production given the endowments of factors of production land labour capital and fertilizers hence the shift parameter δ is a measure of the effect of irrigation on the production of the farms in the sample the parameters were estimated by ordinary least squares ols method the drivers of irrigation adoption in turn were investigated by probit models the dependent variable in these models is measured as a dummy variable i e 1 corresponds to observations in which the farmer adopted irrigation and 0 corresponds to cases of non adoption the probability of adopting irrigation is estimated by 2 p r o b y 1 x φ x β x β φ t d t x β 1 2 п e 1 2 t 2 d t in which φ represents the cumulative density function and φ the probability density function of the standard normal distribution β are the parameters and x a vector of the explanatory variables our main interest is to estimate the effect of the use of contracts on the probability of irrigation adoption however endogeneity between irrigation adoption adopt and use of contracts contr may arise which could cause bias in our analysis for example low prices received by farmers in their contracts with processing firms can reduce profitability of the orange production this reduction in profitability may also decrease the probability of irrigation adoption then the decisions of irrigation adoption and contract use can be simultaneous in this case the use of contracts would be correlated with the error term of irrigation adoption equation to deal with this potential endogeneity we estimated an instrumental variables probit model iv probit by using the amemiya s 1978 generalized least squares estimators generally the model is y 1 i y 2 i β x 1 i γ μ i 3 y 2 i x 1 i 1 x 2 i 2 v i x i v i in which i 1 98 y 1 i is a binary dependent variable adopt y 2 i is an endogenous variable contr x 1 i is a vector of exogenous variables assoc manag cred exp cours inco and size x 2 i is a vector of instrumental variables channel riskp and enforc and the equation for y 2 i is written in reduced form β and γ are vectors of structural parameters and 1 and 2 are matrices of the reduced form parameters this is a recursive model i e y 2 i appears in the equation for y 1 i but y 1 i does not appear in the equation for y 2 i the estimated equation for y 1 i can be rewritten as y 1 i x i v i β x 1 i γ μ i 4 we estimated two probit models in the first model we assume exogeneity between irrigation adoption and contracts use while endogeneity is assumed in the second the wald test was applied to test the presence of endogeneity we use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the probability of irrigation adoption in software limdep 10 and the package ivprobit in r table 1 presents the description of the variables used in the probit models it is important to mention that water sources were available in 82 farms of the sample 84 of all sample and in all farms of the subsample of irrigation adopters the role of water availability in the adoption measured by this information cannot be tested in our models because 100 of adopters had water sources other variables that could account water sources characteristics such as volume quality and proximity were not available for a more comprehensive analysis on this issue thus we assume that water availability was not a barrier to irrigation and other drivers would be important to explain adoption our main interest is to test the four hypotheses stated in section 2 mainly the effect of the use of contracts contr access to credit credit participation in agricultural association assoc and the use of management tools manag on irrigation adoption special interest is devoted to the effect of contracts on the adoption additionally we add four control variables to the models the variable size measures the size of the orchards several empirical studies find that large sized farms are more likely to employ irrigation negri et al 2005 bagheri and ghorbani 2011 kamwamba mtethiwa et al 2012 singh et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 in turn the variable exp measures the experience of the farmers in orange production and represents the number of years dedicated to the same activity experience a proxy from accumulated knowledge of the farmer is expected to be positively correlated with the adoption of irrigation the variable cours is a dummy variable which measures the participation of orange growers in courses on irrigation several studies assess how the level of education and access to information affect the likelihood of adoption of irrigation negri et al 2005 bagheri and ghorbani 2011 cunha et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 finally the variable inco measures the percentage of the income of the respondent which derives from the commercialization of oranges we expect that farmers who are more dependent on the income from their orange orchards will be more likely to invest in irrigation given the potential optimization in the use of other factors of production and the reduction of the risk caused by the scarcity of water irrigation adoption can be either part of a strategy to reduce the risk of insufficient rainwater in situations of higher income risk i e yield stabilization strategies or part of a strategy to increase income based on investments in technologies that improve the productivity of orchards i e yield increase strategies three instrumental variables channel riskp and enforc were used to the estimation of reduced form equation in the iv probit model these variables must affect the use of contracts but cannot affect the irrigation adoption they also must be exogenous the variable channel measures the main commercialization channel used by farmer as presented in the sample description distribution channel does not differentiate adopters from non adopters nevertheless the distribution channel may affect the use of contracts because the latter is more frequent in transaction with processing firms it is expected that farmers who sell most of his her orange production to processing firms are more likely to use contracts riskp is a proxy for the propensity of farmer to accept risks in orange commercialization the finance behavioral literature shows that the greater a farmer s risk propensity the less likely he she is to use contracts see franken et al 2014 we expect negative effect of riskp on the use of contracts enforc is a proxy for farmers perception about the judicial system as a mean to enforce legal rights in contracts as pointed by north 1994 the enforcement of contracts is fundamental to reduce transaction costs in economic system farmers who perceive that contract rights can be enforced would be more confident to accept contracts descriptive statistics of the variables used in the analyzes of the drivers of irrigation adoption are displayed in table 2 4 results table 3 summarizes the results of the translog production function model the f test of significance 0 00 rejects the hypothesis that all of the coefficients are equal to 0 at the 1 percent level the r2 for the estimated model has a value of 0 95 meaning that irrigation and the factors of production included in the analysis i e land labour capital and fertilizers explain 95 of the patterns of orange production in the farms in our sample following the prevalent practices in the empirical literature we use the mean scaled variables for the output and for the input factors to estimate the translog function the estimated first order coefficients β1 β2 β3 and β4 which account for the four factors of production have positive sign hence the estimated translog function respects the monotonocity condition for the sample mean since the translog production function is not globally concave i e is not characterized by convex isoquants we check the concavity conditions for the properties of the sample calculating the first and second derivatives as well as the determinant of the hessian matrix for the sample mean the results show that the concavity conditions are respected for the sample mean the use of mean scaled variables allows us to interpret each one of the first order coefficients of the translog function as the partial elasticity of production for the sample mean thus a 1 increase in the area measured in hectares results in an increase of 0 54 in orange production ceteris paribus at the sample mean both for inputs and output interpreting the coefficients for the other inputs demands a similar approach the elasticity of scale i e the sum of the first order coefficients of the translog function for the sample mean is equivalent to 1 04 given that this value is very close to 1 we can assume the existence of constant returns of scale for the sample mean the parameter δ which represents the most relevant parameter in our production function analysis has a value of 0 219 and a statistical significance at the 1 percent level hence we can identify a clear positive effect of the adoption of irrigation on the production function of the analyzed farms this result means that irrigation adoption increases by 21 9 the orange production of the farms in our sample ceteris paribus overall our analysis supports the idea that the use of irrigation increases the productivity of the factors of production in the orange farms in the state of são paulo brazil table 4 shows the estimates of the probit models used to investigate the drivers of adoption of irrigation the wald test suggest the rejection of exogeneity at 5 level in this respect the iv probit model tends to provide the most consistent estimates it is important to observe that the main results parameters signs and statistically significances mainly the estimates of the variable contr are similar under the two specifications indicating robustness the binary iv probit model correctly predicts 74 5 of the adoption decisions while the probit model predicts 77 5 of the adoption decisions moreover the p value of the wald test prob chi2 rejects the null hypothesis that all coefficients of the variables are equal to zero in the two models hence the models can be used to explain the drivers of adoption of irrigation among the orange farmers in our sample the statistical significances for all the variables in our models are informed as we discuss the results however we focus on explaining the results whose statistical significance is at least at the 10 percent level for supporting or rejecting our hypotheses among the control variables size has no statistically significant effect on the likelihood of adoption of irrigation the result suggests that the possibility of achieving gains of scale is an insufficient driver of adoption in the são paulo s orange belt in turn experience is also not important to explain the adoption of irrigation 1 1 it could be argued that farmers who are close to retirement age are unlikely to adopt new technologies therefore age would be an important factor the pearson correlation index between exp and age of farmers is 0 72 and statistically significant at 1 level in this case inclusion of age and exp in the same models would lead to multicollinearity problems additionally we estimated different specifications in our probit models to include some proxies for retirement age e g age of farmers and a dummy variable with value 1 for farmers who are over 60 years of age and 0 otherwise these variables were also not statistically significant at 10 level in these models as expected the participation in courses on irrigation is positively associated with irrigation adoption at the 5 percent level finally the variable inco has a positive and significant effect on adopt at the 1 percent level hence the likelihood of adopting irrigation is higher among growers who depend more on the revenue from their orange orchards now we turn to the discussion of our hypotheses consistent with hypothesis 1 the participation in agricultural associations positively affects the adoption of irrigation in the farms analysed at the 10 percent level together with the fact that the control variable cours i e participation in courses on irrigation has a positive effect on irrigation adoption at the 1 percent level this result reinforces the idea that the diffusion of information is an important mechanism to foster the adoption of technologies by farmers zhang et al 2019 the information shared among the members of a farmers collective action can shed light on details related to the technical performance and the economic benefits of irrigation helping to shape a positive judgment on adoption moreover the progressive diffusion of new techniques might create the possibility of broader quality upgrade initiatives a strategy that can potentially lead to the creation of additional value in the agri food chain we find no strong support for hypothesis 2 more specifically the use of management tools appears to exert a limited influence in the adoption of irrigation in the são paulo s orange belt the statistical significance of the coefficient is at the 15 percent level our results capture a weak link between the existence of capabilities and resources that may support the adoption of a technology and the decision to adopt it previous research shows that the ownership of capabilities and resources helps to shape the set of feasible organizational arrangements for agricultural producers miranda and chaddad 2014 a similar logic can be extended to adoption choices before a technology is adopted potential users must know how to take advantage of it nevertheless our findings suggest that knowing how to take advantage of it does not imply the possibility of appropriating the results of the investment other factors such as the power asymmetry in the bilateral relationship between the orange producer and the juice processing firm likely affect the decision as well access to credit positively affects the adoption of irrigation among the orange growers in our sample only at the 15 percent level thus hypothesis 3 is not corroborated at the same time we acknowledge that this result demands further scrutiny given the substantial amount of physical capital required to implement irrigation access to financial resources is likely to facilitate the adoption of this technology although rural credit in brazil is subsidized i e interest rates are lower than those found in the marketplace many farmers are unable to access rural credit lines reasons for the existence of such constraints include the lack of collaterals the existence of previous unpaid debts or the evaluation that some farmers belong to high non payment risk groups disparities in the ability of accessing credit lines might widen the income differentials among farmers in particular when the adoption of a technology leads to the reduction of costs or higher economic gains carrer et al 2020 in the case of the são paulo s orange belt however it is not clear whether factors such as credit access or the progressive spread of information would suffice to support an increase in the rate of adoption of irrigation the reason given the considerable bargaining power held by the buyers of oranges potential gains derived from investments in specific assets would likely be captured by the few firms in the juice processing segment for instance our empirical analysis shows that the probability of adoption of irrigation by the farmers of our sample is negatively affected by the use of contracts with processing firms at 5 level of significance this result supports hypothesis 4 shedding light on relevant implications of the interaction between bargaining power and efficiency the qualitative evidence collected during the first stage of this research suggests that farmers who decide to sell their oranges in the fresh fruit market have enhanced incentives to adopt irrigation in fact buyers in this market channel pay higher prices and demand higher quality fruits in our sample the average price received by the farmers who sold oranges to the fresh fruit market was 10 50 brazilian real compared to 8 60 brazilian real received from juice processing firms the frictions in the transactions between farmers and juice processing firms appear to have reduced the incentives for the adoption of advanced technologies in the production of oranges resulting in negative effects on productivity 5 discussion this article shows that the use of contracts between brazilian orange growers and juice processing firms is negatively associated with the decision of adopting irrigation this result is counterintuitive inspired by the work of williamson 1987 economists dedicated to the analysis of agri food supply chains and networks have argued that the establishment of a contract implies safeguards that contribute to the materialization of specific investments the idea that the level of contract incompleteness can influence technology adoption i e more incomplete contracts might disincentivize investments in more advanced technologies acemoglu et al 2007 is still not fully incorporated in this literature after all williamson s discriminating alignment hypothesis predicts that agents will necessarily find an organizational solution that solves adaptation problems in a bilateral relationship independent of the fact that contract incompleteness is pervasive see granovetter 1985 further research must disentangle the multiple dimensions related to a pattern of contract stability trying to elucidate the complex relationship between power based and efficiency based factors in the establishment of formal agreements the potential research avenues opened by such counterintuitive results are the main contribution of our article the case of the orange sector in brazil suggests that distributive issues can be as important as efficiency issues to determine how an agricultural commodity will be produced creating additional challenges for policy makers for instance traditional policy prescriptions such as the provision of credit and extension services might be necessary but insufficient conditions for the adoption of irrigation whenever growers perceive that the economic results of their efforts might be partially capture by upstream or downstream members of the agri food supply chain incentives for the adoption of a new technology might be reduced at the same time the participation in formal organizations e g cooperatives and networks should likely affect the potential impact of policies further research may investigate the structural characteristics of the networks that tie orange growers from the brazilian orange belt for example scholars can compare the effects of the participation in cooperatives and other types of organization such as producers associations and pools in the diffusion of relevant information on agricultural technologies likewise the consequences of the existence of strong ties and weak ties to innovation adoption can be further studied further research can also investigate for example how asymmetric bargaining power or orange producer s perceptions on this level of asymmetry affects both the choice of a market channel and technology adoption decisions another potential topic for future research would be the analysis of the impact of actual conflicts over time on the orange growers predisposition to acquire knowledge that is necessary for the adoption of new technologies in their orchards many frictions have characterized the contractual relationship between farmers and juice processing firms ito and zylbersztajn 2016 carrer and souza filho 2018 therefore experience should not necessarily lead to a higher likelihood to employ techniques that would enable a more efficient use of the available resources 6 conclusions this paper aims to identify the drivers of irrigation adoption by orange growers located in the centre north region of the state of são paulo brazil in the introduction we also report the results of an assessment of the impact of irrigation adoption on the productivity of orange orchards to the best of our knowledge this is the first article to analyse the issue the estimated translog production function shows that given the endowment of the other factors of production included in the analysis the adoption of irrigation has a positive effect of 21 9 on orange production of farms therefore we find that the adoption of irrigation has a statistically significant positive effect on the productivity of the farms included in our sample of course such growth in the productivity level of orange orchards may be insufficient to incentivize the diffusion of irrigation for instance irrigation adoption rates are rather low using primary data from a survey of 98 orange growers our study provides a potential explanation for such apparent paradox considering the continuous conflicts between orange growers and juice processing firms in the brazilian orange belt our results suggest that the existence of contracts with processing firms does not increase the likelihood of adoption of new technologies our main empirical result is aligned with the shifts from the traditional market power framework to one that includes ideas such as buyer market power and the role of contracts as governance tools to manage transactions in the agri food chains see bonanno et al 2018 for instance our results suggest that irrigation adoption in the brazilian orange belt is associated with the strategy to circumvent the oligopsonistic power of juice processing firms from the perspective of orange producers more research is needed to understand the complex interplay between the choice of technology and the choice of distribution channel in the brazilian orange industry moreover the results indicate that human capital and information play an important role in irrigation adoption attendance to courses on irrigation and membership to associations positively affect the adoption of irrigation these conclusions can influence the design of public policies particularly to the design of policies with the goal to enhance rural credit supply extension services and training in farm management in particular the provision of subsidies might be seen with caution in agri food chains with highly asymmetric bargaining power support measures might be appropriated mostly by oligopsonistic firms limiting the benefits for farmers beyond the issues outlined in our discussion section we acknowledge the following limitations in our analysis first this paper uses cross sectional data for the single crop season year of 2013 2014 hence we could not assess the impact of technological changes or the effects of changes in variables such as orange prices and input prices on irrigation adoption furthermore we could not collect information on the exact location of the farms given the relevance of site asset specificity in explaining the emergence of bargaining power in contractual relationships in the agricultural sector this information might help to depict a more precise picture of the nature of the conflicts in the brazilian orange industry finally the sample was not large enough to estimate spatial econometric models that would allow an analysis of the potential technological spillovers effects from the adoption of irrigation these issues can all be addressed

10665,this article analyses the drivers of adoption of irrigation systems by orange growers in the state of são paulo brazil given the scarcity of similar studies focusing on the brazilian orange sector the starting point of our article is the estimation of a translog production function to assess the impact of irrigation on the production of a sample of 98 são paulo s orange growers the results showed that irrigation adoption increased orange production of the farms in the sample by 21 9 ceteris paribus despite the potential benefits of irrigation adoption was rather low only 24 6 of the orange orchards area in the brazilian orange belt was irrigated in 2015 starting from this apparent paradox we argue that the information asymmetry and conflicts observed in the contractual relationship between growers and juice processing firms reduce the incentives for the adoption of technologies in the brazilian orange sector we apply probit models to the same sample to test four hypotheses on drivers of the decision to adopt irrigation the results of our empirical analysis show that the use of contracts in transactions with processing firms negatively affect the adoption of irrigation the analysis also identifies other variables that influence positively the adoption of irrigation participation in producers associations participation in courses on irrigation and dependence on the income from the orange orchard the results of this study suggest that the design of policies aimed at fostering irrigation adoption must consider potential bargaining power asymmetries in the relationships between the users of irrigation and the buyers of their agricultural production keywords contracts irrigation bargaining power technology adoption 1 introduction brazil produced 17 7 tons of orange in the market year 2017 2018 which represented around 34 of the world production united states department of agriculture usda 2019 according to the brazilian agricultural census almost 56 000 farms had orchards with at least 50 orange trees in 2017 ibge 2017 the brazilian orange production is clustered in the state of são paulo which produced 12 9 million tons in 2018 ibge 2018 around 80 of the são paulo s orange production is directed to the juice processing industry the remaining supply is traded in the fresh fruit market neves et al 2010 in the market year of 2018 2019 1 03 million tons of orange juice were produced in brazil a volume that represents more than half of the world production united states department of agriculture usda 2018 brazil is a major exporter of orange juice as well selling over 75 of the global orange juice exports united states department of agriculture usda 2019 several varieties of orange are cultivated in brazil to comply with quality requirements of the industry the most representative varieties are pera rio valencia valencia folha murcha hamlin westin and rubi among these hamlin is the only variety grown exclusively for the juice processing market citrus defense fund fundecitrus 2019 since the turn of the twenty first century several challenges have negatively affected the profitability of orange growers in the state of são paulo farmers have faced increasing production costs that result from the high incidence of pests and diseases such as greening and citrus canker moreover most brazilian orange growers sell their production to firms with a marked oligopsonistic position in the juice processing industry three brazilian firms dominate the orange juice export market accounting for 98 of the brazilian orange juice exports consequently growers are subjected to the considerable bargaining power accumulated by these large exporters ito and zylbersztajn 2018 farmers have limited alternative to sell their production given that the fresh fruit market is relatively small and orange demand is price inelastic in 2016 the brazilian economic defense administrative council cade approved the terms of a settlement in a cartel investigation against orange juice processors it was a long investigation which lasted for 17 years and resulted in a payment of 301 million brazilian real to cade it is also important to take into account that the orange market is characterized by high price volatility taken together these factors led a considerable number of orange growers to abandon the activity from 1996 2018 the number of orange growers in the state was reduced by more than 79 citrus defense fund fundecitrus 2019 given this challenging context the adoption of new practices and technologies in the orange orchards of the state of são paulo may contribute to a reduction of the rate of exit of the orange market in particular a growing research body has suggested that the adoption of irrigation can lead to a substantial increase of the productivity of orange orchards as well as improving fruit quality i e ratio of juice the weight and size of oranges petillo and castel 2004 duenhas et al 2005 given the scarcity of similar studies focused on the brazilian orange sector the starting point of our article is an estimation of a translog production function to assess the impact of irrigation on orange production a survey comprising 98 orange growers of the state of são paulo provided cross sectional data at the farm level for the crop season of 2013 2014 according our estimation irrigation increases orange production by 21 9 as showed in section 4 despite the potential benefits of irrigation only 24 6 of the orange orchards area in the brazilian orange belt comprised by são paulo and the southwest of the state of minas gerais was irrigated in 2015 fundecitrus 2015 starting from this apparent paradox this paper discusses the following research question what are the factors that explain the low diffusion of irrigation in the brazilian orange belt in order to accomplish this task we estimate probit models to analyse the drivers of adoption of irrigation systems from data of the same survey of 98 orange growers the nature of the transactions between orange growers and juice processing firms was examined as several authors describe conflicts among them in the brazilian orange belt are recurrent figueiredo et al 2013 ito and zylbersztajn 2016 carrer and souza filho 2018 in particular the considerable bargaining power held by juice processing firms allows them to design contracts and to explicitly manipulate the level of incompleteness of these agreements to capture a greater share of the quasi rent derived from orange transactions ito and zylbersztajn 2018 hence our main interest is in assessing how the existence of contracts between orange growers and juice processing firms affects the adoption of irrigation following acemoglu et al s 2007 contribution we argue that the information asymmetries and conflicts observed in the relationship between growers and juice processing firms reduce the incentives for the adoption of more advanced technologies in the orange sector see also ménard 2018 in the pages below we show that the use of contracts with juice processing firms in the commercialization of oranges reduces the likelihood of adoption of irrigation among the orange farms in our sample we also test other three hypotheses first the participation in producers associations positively affects the adoption of irrigation a result that suggests the importance of collective actions for the sharing of relevant information among farmers nevertheless we do not identify a significative influence of factors such as the access to credit and the use of management tools on irrigation adoption taken together these results suggest that the bargaining power concentrated in the hands of juice producers has contributed to the low rates of irrigation adoption in the brazilian orange industry 2 literature review and hypotheses the adoption of a technology occurs when an individual accepts to use and employs a new technology continuously feder et al 1985 whenever a technology is developed and introduced in the market adoption will be heterogeneous while some entrepreneurs will adopt the technology instantly others will postpone its adoption and a portion of potential users will never adopt it caswell 1991 in turn the diffusion of a technology is characterized by the aggregate adoption of a technology generally in replacement of an old technology used to solve the same set of problems within a population or area over time rogers 1962 early studies on technology diffusion have employed epidemic diffusion models which are based on the idea that diffusion depends on the reduction of the informational uncertainty related to the adoption of the technology griliches 1957 mansfield 1961 however researchers soon realized that the expected profits derived from adoption may vary depending on the features of the firm under consideration in response scholars have extensively analyzed how particular thresholds affect the economic benefits of use of a given technology a well known example is david s 1969 analysis of the drivers of adoption of mechanical grain reapers in the united states during the nineteenth century the study which employs a threshold model of technology diffusion showed that the size of the farm was a fundamental factor behind the adoption decision since farmers had to make a choice between manual methods with high variable costs and mechanical grain reapers a farm had to be large enough to take advantage of the potential economies of scale that derive from the adoption of the technology the introduction of threshold models has shifted the empirical analysis from the study of an aggregate adoption process to an individual decision making process in this sense threshold models assume that the adoption of a technology results from a profit maximizing or utility maximizing behaviour in a heterogeneous population of decision makers foster and rosenzweig 2010 carrer et al 2017 individuals will adopt a new technology if adoption increases the net revenue from production at the same time different preferences and other external factors will also affect the adoption of a technology galliano and orozco 2011 for instance the threshold model allows the identification of several factors that affect the adoption of a new technology at the individual level these insights can highly influence the formulation of public policies and private strategies accelerating the diffusion of a new technology geroski 2000 beyond david s threshold model basic tenets several studies assume the influence of other demand and supply factors on the decision of adopting a technology examples include factors such as the previous number of users of a technology reinganum 1981 economic learning and learning by using stoneman 1981 rosenberg 1982 risk attitudes kondouri et al 2006 salazar and rand 2016 and suppliers profits metcalfe 1981 while these contributions have enhanced our understanding of how innovation is adopted and diffused the progressive development of the literature has added complexity to empirical analyses in particular the inclusion of variables with dynamic properties has increased the amount of information to be collected and included in empirical models berger 2001 most studies that analyse the drivers of irrigation adoption use threshold models to identify a critical level of heterogeneity that would differentiate adopters and non adopters caswell 1991 this broad literature can be divided in three main strands the first strand studies the secondary adoption of irrigation that is the factors that lead farmers to replace their current irrigation system adopting more efficient ones fishelson and rymon 1989 dinar and yaron 1990 koundouri et al 2006 schuck et al 2007 in turn the second strand encompasses studies that identify the drivers of choice of one irrigation system over another in this strand researchers generally assume that the decision to adopt irrigation had already been made when farmers chose an irrigation system negri and brooks 1990 green et al 1996 moreno and sunding 2005 after all profit maximizer farmers will choose to use an irrigation system only if the technology is perceived to be more profitable than alternative options caswell and zilberman 1985 finally the third strand comprises contributions that assess the primary adoption of irrigation i e situations in which the farmer has never used irrigation and can choose whether to adopt the technology given the low diffusion of irrigation in the brazilian orange belt our hypotheses derive mostly from the theoretical and empirical developments of the primary adoption of irrigation strand of literature researchers highlight four categories that affect the adoption of irrigation during this stage of the decision making process i access and sharing of information ii technical and managerial skills iii the organizational and institutional environments and iv structural and agronomic aspects of the farm in the paragraphs below we derive hypothesis related to the first three of these four categories identified in the literature reflecting the fact that all the farms in our sample come from the same geographical region the results of our survey show similar structural and agronomic characteristics for each observation hence we do not include hypotheses related to this category in our empirical analysis yet we acknowledge that previous studies have analysed the influence of structural and agronomic aspects such as temperature and precipitation levels torkamani and shajari 2008 cunha et al 2014 cremades et al 2015 access to water sources e g he et al 2007 alcon et al 2011 singh et al 2015 soil type negri et al 2005 cremades et al 2015 and the access to infrastructure kulshreshtha and brown 1993 2 1 access and sharing of information information usually plays a fundamental role in inducing the adoption of a technology for instance the seminal contributions by griliches 1957 and mansfield 1961 associate the cumulative adoption of a technology over time with the progressive dissemination of information among its potential users more available information means an enhanced ability to evaluate the costs and benefits of adoption geroski 2000 galliano and orozco 2011 moreover the cumulative adoption of a technology may help farmers to understand how to operate it properly namara et al 2007 as geroski 2000 points out a technology has two aspects the hardware aspect i e the physical characteristics and the software aspect which is the amount of information that is needed to use it effectively since knowledge from an adopter s perspective is built up mainly from the experience of use of a technology it is reasonable to assume that the establishment of communication channels among farmers foster the transmission of information related to the software aspects of irrigation genius et al 2013 the literature identifies several mechanisms that support the diffusion of information on irrigation galioto et al 2020 following the widespread interest in understanding the relationship between the existence of extension programs and the adoption of a technology several studies show that farmers who interact with technical assistance staff are more likely to adopt irrigation systems he et al 2007 alcon et al 2011 cunha et al 2014 cremades et al 2015 ferreira 2015 zhang et al 2019 similarly training programs on the operation of an irrigation system may provide the necessary information e g practical demonstrations that would reduce the uncertainty related to the adoption of the technology finally interactions between user and non users of a technology can occur either because of geographical proximity or due to the membership to organizations such as associations and cooperatives vinholis et al 2016 other studies show that the members of farmers organizations receive more information positively affecting the likelihood of irrigation kulshreshtha and brown 1993 alcon et al 2011 hence we expect that hypothesis 1 the adoption of irrigation is positively affected by participation in agricultural associations 2 2 technical and managerial skills the appropriate operation of irrigation systems requires technical and managerial skills hence human capital and use of management tools matter anderson et al 1999 namara et al 2007 zhang et al 2019 studies show that the educational level of farmers positively affects the likelihood of adoption of a technology bagheri and ghorbani 2011 carrer et al 2017 from a farm management perspective education may be a necessary but an insufficient condition for an appropriate operation of the bundle of resources within the boundaries of the farm for instance the absorptive capacity of an organization i e the ability to recognize the value of a piece of information and use it to pursue economic gain depends on the establishment of appropriate organizational structures or the existence of know how see cohen and levinthal 1990 vinholis et al 2016 in the brazilian orange belt we expect that these capabilities should be supported by management tools that facilitate the gathering of information examples include the use of specialized software and the participation in certification systems that require the provision of relevant data the available evidence shows that these tools help to foster the adoption of innovations in farms bernard and fan 2004 therefore we expect that hypothesis 2 the adoption of irrigation is positively affected by the use of management tools 2 3 the organizational and institutional environments multiple organizational and institutional factors affect technology adoption and diffusion feder et al 1985 galliano and orozco 2011 in the literature dedicated to analysing the phenomenon in agricultural contexts the idea that farmers face a series of constraints to adopt new technologies is pervasive a commonly studied constraint with an institutional component is limited access to credit farmers from developing countries often cannot provide a collateral and therefore are unable to obtain credit the broad literature discussing how credit access affects technology adoption identifies several explanatory variables examples include factors directly related to the ability of a farmer to provide a collateral e g the size of the farm and the ownership of equipment and indirect factors such as community ties proximity between lenders and borrowers and the nature of the household relationships negri et al 2005 salazar and rand 2016 carrer et al 2020 irrespective of the driver of assess to credit however we expect that an enhanced ability to borrow resources from public or private organizations will increase the probability of adoption of irrigation ceteris paribus he et al 2007 alcon et al 2011 hypothesis 3 the adoption of irrigation is positively affected by access to rural credit finally we assess the role of contracts in the adoption of irrigation in the brazilian orange belt contracts are an important coordination mechanism in this sector vertical integration explains the supply of 40 of the oranges used by the brazilian juice processing industry with large volumes 60 being sold by independent growers forwards contracts that range from one to two years of duration are most commonly used in transactions between orange growers and processing firms spot market transactions are unusual in the juice processing market in the fresh orange segment however spot market transactions are the most common transaction in general growers sell fresh fruits to packinghouses which classify clean and distribute the oranges to both domestic retailers and foreign markets farmers may eventually have their own packinghouses scholars have long assumed that farmers are risk averse stiglitz 1974 a claim that is widely used in the empirical research giné and yang 2009 in this sense efficient contracts would balance the benefits from enhanced incentives and the costs from risk bearing meyer et al 1992 potentially fostering the materialization of investments in technology however the idea that risk preferences play a fundamental role in shaping contracts in agriculture is not consensual for instance allen and lueck 1995 use a transaction cost based framework to explain the adoption of contracts among farmers people are assumed to be risk neutral under a transaction cost based logic with the features of the contracts ensuing from an alignment between the characteristics of the transaction and the necessary instruments to enforce the exchange williamson 1987 hence fear of ex post expropriation of the gains derived from investments in specific assets becomes a driving force in the design of contracts klein et al 1978 despite these threats transaction cost based theorists tend to predict the design of contractual remedies that mitigate the probability of opportunistic behaviour allen and lueck 2002 nevertheless people are often unable to design contracts that secure investments in specific assets acemoglu et al 2007 show that a greater level of contractual incompleteness may disincentive a firm to adopt more advanced technologies given the frictions that may arise among the parties in other cases the design of relatively standardized contracts is insufficient for protecting the quasi rent derived from specific investments ménard 2018 furthermore new dimensions of market power such as the use of contracts to unilaterally impose restrictions on the actions of other parties have become more common in agri food supply chains see bonanno et al 2018 the brazilian orange belt illustrates this argument as ito and zylbersztajn 2016 point out orange juice processing firms from the state of são paulo hold a considerable ability to influence the selection of terms in the contracts with farmers the high barriers to entry in the juice processing segment limit the alternatives of commercialization for brazilian orange producers at the same time juice processing firms have pursued a strategy based on the vertical integration of part of their orange supply a move that has further increased their bargaining power ito and zylbersztajn 2018 the result is a pattern of continuous conflicts between juice processing firms and orange producers with a frequent use of power by firms to shape contractual obligations and capture a greater share of the total surplus generated in the agri food chain carrer and souza filho 2018 consequently we expect that brazilian orange farmers who sell to juice processing firms using contracts have lower incentives to adopt irrigation technologies hypothesis 4 the adoption of irrigation is negatively affected by the use of contracts with juice processing firms 3 materials and methods this article uses a mixed methods development approach greene et al 1989 in which a qualitative research inspires the creation of a survey that informs a quantitative analysis we applied our survey to a random sample of orange farms from the central southern and northern regions of the orange belt of the state of são paulo this state was responsible for 73 of brazilian orange production in 2018 the regions studied had 9370 agricultural production units with orange orchards and account for approximately 50 of this state s total orange production lupa 2017 simple random sampling was used to calculate the sample size with a sampling error of 10 and confidence level of 95 a sample with 98 farms was obtained 47 located in the southern 31 in the central and 20 in the northern region of the citrus belt the sample is divided in two groups 34 adopters of irrigation and 64 non adopters of irrigation we consider adopters the growers who had any type of irrigation system in any fraction of their orange orchards during the crop season of 2013 2014 face to face interviews with the orange growers were performed between march and september of 2014 the questionnaire was divided into three main blocks i personal characteristics of the orange farmers ii structural aspects of the production process iii aspects of the decision making process and individual perceptions on relevant institutional and economic factors the cross section data refers to 2013 14 crop year it is relevant to present some characteristics of the farms in the sample oranges are the main output of all sampled farms in addition to orange other crops were cultivated in some farms e g lemon sugar cane and cattle on average oranges were cultivated in 65 of the available agricultural land of these farms in 53 farms 54 of the total sample oranges were cultivated in 100 of their available agricultural land while in 45 farms other crops were cultivated as well adopters and non adopters of irrigation grow many varieties of oranges the adopters orange area consisted of pera rio 42 of the irrigated area valencia 29 hamlin 8 folha murcha 7 westin 4 and other varieties 10 while the non adopters grow pera rio 36 of the orange area valencia 31 hamlin 11 natal 1 folha murcha 7 westin 5 and other varieties 9 these distributions were not statistically different between the two groups all varieties with exception of hamlin could be sold in both fresh fruit market and juice processing market in fact 76 of adopters had sold their oranges in both markets and 24 in the fresh fruit market exclusively while 67 of non adopters had sold in both markets and 33 in the fresh fruit market exclusively our econometric analyses can be subdivided in two steps i translog production function estimation ii probit models estimation a flexible translog production function was estimated to measure the impact of irrigation as a technological change on orange production of the sampled farms the following specific form describes the proposed econometric model 1 l n y i β 0 β 1 l n x 1 i β 2 l n x 2 i β 3 l n x 3 i β 4 l n x 4 i β 11 1 2 l n 2 x 1 i β 12 l n x 1 i l n x 2

machine hours and fertilizers x4 in kilo irriga is a dummy variable for irrigation adoption β is a vector of the parameters of the production function to be estimated δ is the shift parameter that captures the impact of irrigation adoption on the production function ui is a random error term independent and identically distributed and i denotes the i th of 98 farms in the sample the estimation of the parameter δ allows the quantification of the impact of the adoption of irrigation on orange production given the endowments of factors of production land labour capital and fertilizers hence the shift parameter δ is a measure of the effect of irrigation on the production of the farms in the sample the parameters were estimated by ordinary least squares ols method the drivers of irrigation adoption in turn were investigated by probit models the dependent variable in these models is measured as a dummy variable i e 1 corresponds to observations in which the farmer adopted irrigation and 0 corresponds to cases of non adoption the probability of adopting irrigation is estimated by 2 p r o b y 1 x φ x β x β φ t d t x β 1 2 п e 1 2 t 2 d t in which φ represents the cumulative density function and φ the probability density function of the standard normal distribution β are the parameters and x a vector of the explanatory variables our main interest is to estimate the effect of the use of contracts on the probability of irrigation adoption however endogeneity between irrigation adoption adopt and use of contracts contr may arise which could cause bias in our analysis for example low prices received by farmers in their contracts with processing firms can reduce profitability of the orange production this reduction in profitability may also decrease the probability of irrigation adoption then the decisions of irrigation adoption and contract use can be simultaneous in this case the use of contracts would be correlated with the error term of irrigation adoption equation to deal with this potential endogeneity we estimated an instrumental variables probit model iv probit by using the amemiya s 1978 generalized least squares estimators generally the model is y

assoc manag cred exp cours inco and size x 2 i is a vector of instrumental variables channel riskp and enforc and the equation for y 2 i is written in reduced form β and γ are vectors of structural parameters and 1 and 2 are matrices of the reduced form parameters this is a recursive model i e y 2 i appears in the equation for y 1 i but y 1 i does not appear in the equation for y 2 i the estimated equation for y 1 i can be rewritten as y 1 i x i v i β x 1 i γ μ i 4 we estimated two probit models in the first model we assume exogeneity between irrigation adoption and contracts use while endogeneity is assumed in the second the wald test was applied to test the presence of endogeneity we use the maximum likelihood method to estimate the probability of irrigation adoption in software limdep 10 and the package ivprobit in r table 1 presents the description of the variables used in the probit models it is important to mention that water sources were available in 82 farms of the sample 84 of all sample and in all farms of the subsample of irrigation adopters the role of water availability in the adoption measured by this information cannot be tested in our models because 100 of adopters had water sources other variables that could account water sources characteristics such as volume quality and proximity were not available for a more comprehensive analysis on this issue thus we assume that water availability was not a barrier to irrigation and other drivers would be important to explain adoption our main interest is to test the four hypotheses stated in section 2 mainly the effect of the use of contracts contr access to credit credit participation in agricultural association assoc and the use of management tools manag on irrigation adoption special interest is devoted to the effect of contracts on the adoption additionally we add four control variables to the models the variable size measures the size of the orchards several empirical studies find that large sized farms are more likely to employ irrigation negri et al 2005 bagheri and ghorbani 2011 kamwamba mtethiwa et al 2012 singh et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 in turn the variable exp measures the experience of the farmers in orange production and represents the number of years dedicated to the same activity experience a proxy from accumulated knowledge of the farmer is expected to be positively correlated with the adoption of irrigation the variable cours is a dummy variable which measures the participation of orange growers in courses on irrigation several studies assess how the level of education and access to information affect the likelihood of adoption of irrigation negri et al 2005 bagheri and ghorbani 2011 cunha et al 2014 zhang et al 2019 finally the variable inco measures the percentage of the income of the respondent which derives from the commercialization of oranges we expect that farmers who are more dependent on the income from their orange orchards will be more likely to invest in irrigation given the potential optimization in the use of other factors of production and the reduction of the risk caused by the scarcity of water irrigation adoption can be either part of a strategy to reduce the risk of insufficient rainwater in situations of higher income risk i e yield stabilization strategies or part of a strategy to increase income based on investments in technologies that improve the productivity of orchards i e yield increase strategies three instrumental variables channel riskp and enforc were used to the estimation of reduced form equation in the iv probit model these variables must affect the use of contracts but cannot affect the irrigation adoption they also must be exogenous the variable channel measures the main commercialization channel used by farmer as presented in the sample description distribution channel does not differentiate adopters from non adopters nevertheless the distribution channel may affect the use of contracts because the latter is more frequent in transaction with processing firms it is expected that farmers who sell most of his her orange production to processing firms are more likely to use contracts riskp is a proxy for the propensity of farmer to accept risks in orange commercialization the finance behavioral literature shows that the greater a farmer s risk propensity the less likely he she is to use contracts see franken et al 2014 we expect negative effect of riskp on the use of contracts enforc is a proxy for farmers perception about the judicial system as a mean to enforce legal rights in contracts as pointed by north 1994 the enforcement of contracts is fundamental to reduce transaction costs in economic system farmers who perceive that contract rights can be enforced would be more confident to accept contracts descriptive statistics of the variables used in the analyzes of the drivers of irrigation adoption are displayed in table 2 4 results table 3 summarizes the results of the translog production function model the f test of significance 0 00 rejects the hypothesis that all of the coefficients are equal to 0 at the 1 percent level the r2 for the estimated model has a value of 0 95 meaning that irrigation and the factors of production included in the analysis i e land labour capital and fertilizers explain 95 of the patterns of orange production in the farms in our sample following the prevalent practices in the empirical literature we use the mean scaled variables for the output and for the input factors to estimate the translog function the estimated first order coefficients β1 β2 β3 and β4 which account for the four factors of production have positive sign hence the estimated translog function respects the monotonocity condition for the sample mean since the translog production function is not globally concave i e is not characterized by convex isoquants we check the concavity conditions for the properties of the sample calculating the first and second derivatives as well as the determinant of the hessian matrix for the sample mean the results show that the concavity conditions are respected for the sample mean the use of mean scaled variables allows us to interpret each one of the first order coefficients of the translog function as the partial elasticity of production for the sample mean thus a 1 increase in the area measured in hectares results in an increase of 0 54 in orange production ceteris paribus at the sample mean both for inputs and output interpreting the coefficients for the other inputs demands a similar approach the elasticity of scale i e the sum of the first order coefficients of the translog function for the sample mean is equivalent to 1 04 given that this value is very close to 1 we can assume the existence of constant returns of scale for the sample mean the parameter δ which represents the most relevant parameter in our production function analysis has a value of 0 219 and a statistical significance at the 1 percent level hence we can identify a clear positive effect of the adoption of irrigation on the production function of the analyzed farms this result means that irrigation adoption increases by 21 9 the orange production of the farms in our sample ceteris paribus overall our analysis supports the idea that the use of irrigation increases the productivity of the factors of production in the orange farms in the state of são paulo brazil table 4 shows the estimates of the probit models used to investigate the drivers of adoption of irrigation the wald test suggest the rejection of exogeneity at 5 level in this respect the iv probit model tends to provide the most consistent estimates it is important to observe that the main results parameters signs and statistically significances mainly the estimates of the variable contr are similar under the two specifications indicating robustness the binary iv probit model correctly predicts 74 5 of the adoption decisions while the probit model predicts 77 5 of the adoption decisions moreover the p value of the wald test prob chi2 rejects the null hypothesis that all coefficients of the variables are equal to zero in the two models hence the models can be used to explain the drivers of adoption of irrigation among the orange farmers in our sample the statistical significances for all the variables in our models are informed as we discuss the results however we focus on explaining the results whose statistical significance is at least at the 10 percent level for supporting or rejecting our hypotheses among the control variables size has no statistically significant effect on the likelihood of adoption of irrigation the result suggests that the possibility of achieving gains of scale is an insufficient driver of adoption in the são paulo s orange belt in turn experience is also not important to explain the adoption of irrigation 1 1 it could be argued that farmers who are close to retirement age are unlikely to adopt new technologies therefore age would be an important factor the pearson correlation index between exp and age of farmers is 0 72 and statistically significant at 1 level in this case inclusion of age and exp in the same models would lead to multicollinearity problems additionally we estimated different specifications in our probit models to include some proxies for retirement age e g age of farmers and a dummy variable with value 1 for farmers who are over 60 years of age and 0 otherwise these variables were also not statistically significant at 10 level in these models as expected the participation in courses on irrigation is positively associated with irrigation adoption at the 5 percent level finally the variable inco has a positive and significant effect on adopt at the 1 percent level hence the likelihood of adopting irrigation is higher among growers who depend more on the revenue from their orange orchards now we turn to the discussion of our hypotheses consistent with hypothesis 1 the participation in agricultural associations positively affects the adoption of irrigation in the farms analysed at the 10 percent level together with the fact that the control variable cours i e participation in courses on irrigation has a positive effect on irrigation adoption at the 1 percent level this result reinforces the idea that the diffusion of information is an important mechanism to foster the adoption of technologies by farmers zhang et al 2019 the information shared among the members of a farmers collective action can shed light on details related to the technical performance and the economic benefits of irrigation helping to shape a positive judgment on adoption moreover the progressive diffusion of new techniques might create the possibility of broader quality upgrade initiatives a strategy that can potentially lead to the creation of additional value in the agri food chain we find no strong support for hypothesis 2 more specifically the use of management tools appears to exert a limited influence in the adoption of irrigation in the são paulo s orange belt the statistical significance of the coefficient is at the 15 percent level our results capture a weak link between the existence of capabilities and resources that may support the adoption of a technology and the decision to adopt it previous research shows that the ownership of capabilities and resources helps to shape the set of feasible organizational arrangements for agricultural producers miranda and chaddad 2014 a similar logic can be extended to adoption choices before a technology is adopted potential users must know how to take advantage of it nevertheless our findings suggest that knowing how to take advantage of it does not imply the possibility of appropriating the results of the investment other factors such as the power asymmetry in the bilateral relationship between the orange producer and the juice processing firm likely affect the decision as well access to credit positively affects the adoption of irrigation among the orange growers in our sample only at the 15 percent level thus hypothesis 3 is not corroborated at the same time we acknowledge that this result demands further scrutiny given the substantial amount of physical capital required to implement irrigation access to financial resources is likely to facilitate the adoption of this technology although rural credit in brazil is subsidized i e interest rates are lower than those found in the marketplace many farmers are unable to access rural credit lines reasons for the existence of such constraints include the lack of collaterals the existence of previous unpaid debts or the evaluation that some farmers belong to high non payment risk groups disparities in the ability of accessing credit lines might widen the income differentials among farmers in particular when the adoption of a technology leads to the reduction of costs or higher economic gains carrer et al 2020 in the case of the são paulo s orange belt however it is not clear whether factors such as credit access or the progressive spread of information would suffice to support an increase in the rate of adoption of irrigation the reason given the considerable bargaining power held by the buyers of oranges potential gains derived from investments in specific assets would likely be captured by the few firms in the juice processing segment for instance our empirical analysis shows that the probability of adoption of irrigation by the farmers of our sample is negatively affected by the use of contracts with processing firms at 5 level of significance this result supports hypothesis 4 shedding light on relevant implications of the interaction between bargaining power and efficiency the qualitative evidence collected during the first stage of this research suggests that farmers who decide to sell their oranges in the fresh fruit market have enhanced incentives to adopt irrigation in fact buyers in this market channel pay higher prices and demand higher quality fruits in our sample the average price received by the farmers who sold oranges to the fresh fruit market was 10 50 brazilian real compared to 8 60 brazilian real received from juice processing firms the frictions in the transactions between farmers and juice processing firms appear to have reduced the incentives for the adoption of advanced technologies in the production of oranges resulting in negative effects on productivity 5 discussion this article shows that the use of contracts between brazilian orange growers and juice processing firms is negatively associated with the decision of adopting irrigation this result is counterintuitive inspired by the work of williamson 1987 economists dedicated to the analysis of agri food supply chains and networks have argued that the establishment of a contract implies safeguards that contribute to the materialization of specific investments the idea that the level of contract incompleteness can influence technology adoption i e more incomplete contracts might disincentivize investments in more advanced technologies acemoglu et al 2007 is still not fully incorporated in this literature after all williamson s discriminating alignment hypothesis predicts that agents will necessarily find an organizational solution that solves adaptation problems in a bilateral relationship independent of the fact that contract incompleteness is pervasive see granovetter 1985 further research must disentangle the multiple dimensions related to a pattern of contract stability trying to elucidate the complex relationship between power based and efficiency based factors in the establishment of formal agreements the potential research avenues opened by such counterintuitive results are the main contribution of our article the case of the orange sector in brazil suggests that distributive issues can be as important as efficiency issues to determine how an agricultural commodity will be produced creating additional challenges for policy makers for instance traditional policy prescriptions such as the provision of credit and extension services might be necessary but insufficient conditions for the adoption of irrigation whenever growers perceive that the economic results of their efforts might be partially capture by upstream or downstream members of the agri food supply chain incentives for the adoption of a new technology might be reduced at the same time the participation in formal organizations e g cooperatives and networks should likely affect the potential impact of policies further research may investigate the structural characteristics of the networks that tie orange growers from the brazilian orange belt for example scholars can compare the effects of the participation in cooperatives and other types of organization such as producers associations and pools in the diffusion of relevant information on agricultural technologies likewise the consequences of the existence of strong ties and weak ties to innovation adoption can be further studied further research can also investigate for example how asymmetric bargaining power or orange producer s perceptions on this level of asymmetry affects both the choice of a market channel and technology adoption decisions another potential topic for future research would be the analysis of the impact of actual conflicts over time on the orange growers predisposition to acquire knowledge that is necessary for the adoption of new technologies in their orchards many frictions have characterized the contractual relationship between farmers and juice processing firms ito and zylbersztajn 2016 carrer and souza filho 2018 therefore experience should not necessarily lead to a higher likelihood to employ techniques that would enable a more efficient use of the available resources 6 conclusions this paper aims to identify the drivers of irrigation adoption by orange growers located in the centre north region of the state of são paulo brazil in the introduction we also report the results of an assessment of the impact of irrigation adoption on the productivity of orange orchards to the best of our knowledge this is the first article to analyse the issue the estimated translog production function shows that given the endowment of the other factors of production included in the analysis the adoption of irrigation has a positive effect of 21 9 on orange production of farms therefore we find that the adoption of irrigation has a statistically significant positive effect on the productivity of the farms included in our sample of course such growth in the productivity level of orange orchards may be insufficient to incentivize the diffusion of irrigation for instance irrigation adoption rates are rather low using primary data from a survey of 98 orange growers our study provides a potential explanation for such apparent paradox considering the continuous conflicts between orange growers and juice processing firms in the brazilian orange belt our results suggest that the existence of contracts with processing firms does not increase the likelihood of adoption of new technologies our main empirical result is aligned with the shifts from the traditional market power framework to one that includes ideas such as buyer market power and the role of contracts as governance tools to manage transactions in the agri food chains see bonanno et al 2018 for instance our results suggest that irrigation adoption in the brazilian orange belt is associated with the strategy to circumvent the oligopsonistic power of juice processing firms from the perspective of orange producers more research is needed to understand the complex interplay between the choice of technology and the choice of distribution channel in the brazilian orange industry moreover the results indicate that human capital and information play an important role in irrigation adoption attendance to courses on irrigation and membership to associations positively affect the adoption of irrigation these conclusions can influence the design of public policies particularly to the design of policies with the goal to enhance rural credit supply extension services and training in farm management in particular the provision of subsidies might be seen with caution in agri food chains with highly asymmetric bargaining power support measures might be appropriated mostly by oligopsonistic firms limiting the benefits for farmers beyond the issues outlined in our discussion section we acknowledge the following limitations in our analysis first this paper uses cross sectional data for the single crop season year of 2013 2014 hence we could not assess the impact of technological changes or the effects of changes in variables such as orange prices and input prices on irrigation adoption furthermore we could not collect information on the exact location of the farms given the relevance of site asset specificity in explaining the emergence of bargaining power in contractual relationships in the agricultural sector this information might help to depict a more precise picture of the nature of the conflicts in the brazilian orange industry finally the sample was not large enough to estimate spatial econometric models that would allow an analysis of the potential technological spillovers effects from the adoption of irrigation these issues can all be addressed

10666,emitter clogging is one of the most important limiting factors affecting the promotion of drip irrigation to examine the impact of the irrigation time on the lateral environment and to develop an optimal way to mitigate the emitter clogging risk 4 different irrigation times 3 7 10 and 30 times were examined with each irrigation period lasting 2 daily hours then the lateral inner environment was studied from the perspectives of the mass particle size composition mineral composition microbial content of the sediment in the lateral includes sediment deposited in and adhered to the lateral ds and as respectively the index of the emitter clogging risk was used to indicate the emitter clogging level of the drip irrigation system the results indicated that emitter clogging risk rec was significantly correlated with the ds mass as mass rate of change of the as mass and fractal dimension p 0 01 and the as mass was correlated with the bacterial content in the as p 0 05 this finding indicates that rec was affected by the lateral inner environment the ds affected the changes in rec mainly through influencing the mass of clogging substances in the grid structures and the particle size across the labyrinth channel the increasing as captures nutrients and provides a suitable environment for the growth of bacteria in the laterals inlet grid and labyrinth channel additionally the mass of clogging substances mainly the as increased steadily during the process of particle adhesion which leads to irreversible clogging the rec declined rapidly in the initial stage of irrigation and then gradually decreased over the irrigation duration there was a boundary between short and long irrigation times between irrigation times of approximately 7 and 10 in this research which was the optimum lateral flushing period keywords fractal dimension deposited sediment adhered sediment lateral flushing drip irrigation 1 introduction drip irrigation technology has been greatly developed and applied since the 1960s caldwell et al 1994 camp 1997 wang et al 2018 however the emitter channel is narrow and becomes easily clogged camp 1998 yu et al 2019 once emitters become clogged the performance of the drip irrigation project will decrease and the life of the drip irrigation system will be greatly shortened in addition emitter clogging also lowers the yield and quality of crops warrick and gardner 1983 or and hanks 1992 lamm 2016 to reduce the emitter clogging risk in practical drip irrigation projects multiple filtration equipment types and facilities are generally deployed in the first part of the system which requires large investments and high operation management costs therefore determining a strategy to prevent or slow emitter clogging is a research area of increased interest in this field the diversity of water sources in irrigation areas determines the diversity of emitter clogging types nakayama and bucks 1991 in the case of high hardness of the irrigation water source the combination of the high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions and the bicarbonate ions in water generates a large amount of calcium and magnesium precipitates these precipitates enter the pipe and the emitter and adhere to the wall surface resulting in a rough wall and an adhesion layer until the emitter is completely and irreversibly clogged liu et al 2019 the flow rate of the emitter decreases with the extension of the drip irrigation time and the harder the water quality is the more notable the flow rate decrease is in the integrated water and fertilizer drip irrigation process the addition of urea npk fertilizer and compound fertilizer changes the dynamics and thermodynamic properties of the fluid medium in the flow channel liu et al 2018a the gradual precipitation of fertilizer results in physical blockage with extension of the irrigation time while the adsorption and displacement of the main cations in fertilizers lead to the formation of flocs and chemical precipitates n li et al 2019 y k li et al 2019 thus the emitter flow shows three distinct stages of change including the initial wave equilibrium phase the linear acceleration clogging phase and the clogging mitigation phase liu et al 2018b under reclaimed water irrigation conditions because of the influence of multiple factors such as changes in nutrient transport and hydraulic shearing force the variation in emitter clogging degree shows different sensitive response trends with changes in the solid particulate matter phospholipid fatty acid content and extracellular polymers in the epiphytic biofilm zhou et al 2013 ait mouheb et al 2019 emitter flow changes exhibit three other different stages including the initial wave balance phase the start up linear phase and the accelerated linear phase zhou 2016 in summary most of the simulation and field experiment drip irrigation test results showed an emitter flow decreasing trend with extension of the irrigation time besides it seems the clogging process exhibited an irreversible trend in a long term irrigation duration under most condition so if there is any attempt to solve the clogging problem it is inevitably to make the clogging mechanism clear and then to address the corresponding measures because the lateral inner environment communicates with the emitter the associated changes are closely related to the emitter clogging risk expressed as the emitter flow of the drip irrigation system the ability of laterals to carry suspended solids in the drip irrigation system the critical content of the suspended particulate matter is expressed as the reduction of the emitter flow in the laterals the deposited suspended particles may form larger particle flocs that accumulate at the bottom of the lateral under van der waals gravity forces hydrogen bonding and physicochemical adsorption which increases the frictional resistance of the laterals walls and increases the emitter clogging risk zhou 2000 the particle size composition at different locations is different for example the sediment particles are smaller at the beginning and end of the lateral moreover the sediment particles are larger in the middle segment of the lateral and the middle segment is where emitter blockage begins zhao et al 2010 scholars developed a sediment deposition patterns model james et al 1984 in pipes for predicting the accumulation laws of the sediments in laterals by considering the lateral diameter and flow and hydrophobic concentration as well as the density and particle size of the sediment however the present studies have only separately examined the clogging risk changes for different irrigation durations or the sedimentation laws in the laterals most of these studies fail to combine both aspects in a multi angle approach for example how do the various indicators in laterals change during different irrigation periods what are the effects of lateral environment change on emitter clogging does lateral environment change specifically interfere with the lateral environment to change the clogging process and reduce emitter clogging risk this paper analyses the total mass and mass change ratio in the lateral sediment the particle size and mineral composition of the sediment and the quantity of microorganisms for different irrigation times under yellow river drip irrigation conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and devices 2 1 1 materials the sediment in the drip irrigation system was taken from the floodplain of the yangling section of the weihe river in shaanxi china after removing impurities such as branches and grass on the surface of the riverbed silt surface layer sludge at depths of 0 15 cm was collected and mixed evenly then the sludge was air dried and the sample was sieved using a 0 1 mm screen to obtain the target sediment finally the sediment and water from test drip irrigation water sources were mixed since the sand was filtered with a 0 1 mm screen we regarded the mixing water as the water source through the filtration system approximately 96 to 106 μm in the initial sediment the particle volume fractions of 0 002 mm 0 002 0 005 mm 0 005 0 01 mm 0 01 0 02 mm 0 02 0 05 mm and 0 05 0 1 mm accounted for 10 02 3 27 4 67 13 52 43 65 and 24 86 respectively of the total sediment volume the mineral composition of the sediment was tested by xrd rietveld technology the results are shown in table 1 the test water was tap water used by residents in the yangling demonstration zone four test irrigation water samples from each treatment were analysed with an orion aq3700 multi parameter water quality analyzer thermo scientific beverly ma usa the ph value was 8 111 0 012 the electrical conductivity ec was 550 3 4 41 μs cm and the suspended solid content was 128 3 21 mg l the turbidity was 92 4 72 fau the hardness was 400 8 51 mg l the cod5 content was 23 1 45 mg l the iron ion content was 0 2 mg l the total nitrogen content was 0 02 mg l and the total phosphorus content was 18 0 33 mg l the lateral outer diameter was 16 mm the wall thickness was 0 38 mm and the distance between adjacent emitters was 30 cm there were 24 laterals investigated in this experiment with each treatment including 6 laterals according to practical layout in field the emitter was placed at the bottom of the inner section of the lateral 2 1 2 devices the test platform consisted of intelligent controller systems water storage tanks water pumps stirring devices pressure gauges control valves drip irrigation belts laterals and drain pipes fig 1 the head part monitored the working pressure in real time by a pressure sensor and adjusted the return water flow in time by controlling the electric ball valve opening extent to maintain a stable working pressure at a precision of 1 25 at the same time the opening and closing times of the mixer and the water pump were controlled to ensure the irrigation time each drip tape had a length of 6 m and 20 emitters 2 2 experimental design the test was a short cycle indoor simulation test with 4 different irrigation times namely 3 7 10 and 30 times of irrigation denoted as t3 t7 t10 and t30 to stand for different irrigation times before lateral flushing the irrigation event occurred once a day continually with each irrigation period lasting 2 h each treatment was repeated 3 times the total time of the experiment was 30 days when the irrigation events had finished the inlet and outlet of the laterals were opened to flush the laterals for 5 min at a velocity of 0 99 m s to ensure that the deposited sediment was flushed out of the inner environment li et al 2015 during the flushing process the return valve was adjusted to ensure that the operation pressure was maintained at 100 kpa at the same time the effluent from each lateral was collected in a bucket the collected effluent was allowed to settle for one day and then the supernatant lateral water was poured off to collect the sediment at the bottom of the bucket the sediment that was collected from the bucket was mainly deposited in the bottom of the lateral section and was easy to flush away from the lateral in this research this type of sediment was called deposited sediment ds after lateral flushing the washed laterals were cut into approximately 2 cm segments about 280 cut samples in a lateral except the emitter patch dried with 95 alcohol and then placed in an ultrasonic oscillator for 3 min to obtain the sediment on the lateral wall the collected sediment was called the adhered sediment as in this research the ds and as were shaken with the oscillating machine for 30 min and then 10 ml mixed solution of each sample was collected to determine the number of microorganisms the remaining sediment samples were placed in a tin foil bowl and dried at 75 c for 7 h to calculate the sediment mass and determine the particle size and mineral compositions as was only used for microbial population and mineral composition analyses plastic measuring cups were placed under 6 selected emitters in each lateral for 10 min to measure the emitter flow both at 30 min after irrigation started and at 30 min before the end of irrigation the working pressure of the test system was stable at these stages 2 3 index and detection method for the lateral environment in this paper the lateral environment was characterized by the ds and as mass particle size composition mineral composition and microbial quantity 2 3 1 deposited sediment and adhered sediment mass the sediment mass was measured by the drying method the sediment mass used for microbial analysis was converted according to the same concentration as that before drying the sediment the calculation of the sediment mass is as follows 1 m s m a d m t b 1 10 m a d m t b m b d m a d in the equation m s is the sediment mass g m b d is the mass of the water sediment and tin bowl before drying g m a d is the mass of the sediment and tin bowl after drying g and m t b is the mass of the tin bowl g the change rate of the sediment mass rm refers to the average ds or as mass of each irrigation period and the calculation equation is 2 r m m s t in the equation rm is the change rate of the sediment mass g time and t is the number of irrigations in the different treatments 2 3 2 quantity of bacteria the number of microorganisms was detected by the plate counting method the sample to be tested was diluted to 10 5 and 10 6 dispersed bacteria and then 0 1 ml diluted solution was applied to the medium and cultured in a 28 30 c incubator for 48 h each single cell grew to form a colony that was visible to the naked eye a single colony was considered a single cell in the original sample the culture medium for bacteria was a beef paste peptone agar medium that includes 3 g of beef extract 10 g of peptone 5 g of sodium chloride 12 13 g of agar powder and 1000 ml of water in the environment with a ph of 7 2 7 4 the number of bacteria measured in colony forming units cfu in the sample was converted according to the dilution factor and the sampled inoculum 2 3 3 particle size composition the particle size composition was measured by an apa 2000 laser particle analyzer malvern panalytical malvern uk the sediment in the inner lateral was composed of micro particles with self similar structures particle size and volume the particles had some fractal characteristics the fractal dimension d is an index used to describe the irregularity of complex bodies and reflects the validity of a space occupied by an irregular body dathe et al 2001 yang et al 2017 this index was adopted to indicate the particle size composition of the sediment in this research linear fitting analysis was used to analyse the logarithm values of the particle size dr and volume content vr of the sediment for the different treatments the slope of the fitted straight line was 3 d so that the fractal dimension d could be calculated 3 1 g v r lg d r in the equation vr is the ratio of the cumulative volume of particles whose size is smaller than a certain particle size to the total volume of the sediment and dr is the ratio of the maximum particle size of a certain particle size range to the maximum particle size of the test sample 0 2 mm in this paper 2 3 4 mineral composition diffraction images showing the mineral composition of the sediment were obtained by a brooke x ray diffractometer germany d8 advance a25 with an angular range 10 70 and each step exceeding 5 s liang et al 2015 each compound had its own unique diffraction pattern by comparing the diffraction pattern and the pdf phase card the composition information of the sample could be obtained in this paper phase analysis was performed with jade 6 0 from mdi the mineral composition and corresponding content of the sediment were obtained by rietveld quantitative analysis wang et al 2019 bayuseno and schmahl 2019 using an advanced full spectrum analysis software namely topas academic software v6 australia coelho software company the rietveld method compared the theoretical and calculated values of the full spectrum of x ray powder diffraction by calculating the theoretical diffraction spectrum of the known crystal structure phase and calculating the peak shape and experimental peak shape point by point using a computer program and the least squares method the calculated peak shape was fitted to the experimental peak shape that is the difference between the calculated value of the diffraction intensity and the experimental value was minimized since the rietveld method made full use of the entire x ray diffraction spectrum including all the information of possible overlapping diffraction peaks of the various phases contained in the sample and corrected the structural and non structural parameters of each phase the method overcame the distribution of overlapping peaks and improved the accuracy and reliability of quantitative phase analysis zhang 2019 if the sample contained p phases the content of α phase σ α was 4 σ α m α p m p s α z α m α v α p

the fitting expectation and ω i is a weighting factor ω i 1 y goodness of fit gof 7 gof r p r exp because a low r factor reflects a result with high reliability the result is considered acceptable when rwp 15 and gof 5 simultaneously huang and li 2012 sediment particles were derived from rock weathering which was generally classified into physical weathering and chemical weathering the products of physical weathering were mainly layered silicates including montmorillonite kaolinite and illite chemical weathering products were mainly framework silicates such as quartz feldspar and calcite different crystal structures led to differences in the physical properties of these products tian et al 2016 wang et al 2007 thus we classified the sediment components into viscous and non viscous minerals 2 3 5 index of the emitter clogging risk the average relative flow rate characterized the overall clogging degree of the entire drip irrigation pipe belt to account for the error caused by the sediment which resulted in higher density of the water source than clear water the ratio of the beginning flow rate to the ending flow rate was defined as the average relative flow value considering the randomness of emitter clogging the index of the emitter clogging risk r e c was characterized by the total flow rate decrease during the whole irrigation period the temperature error was corrected by pei s method pei et al 2014 8 d r a i 1 n q t q i n 100 where dra is the average relative flow qt is the flow rate at the end of irrigation l h qi is the initial flow rate l h and n is the number of emitters measured on the laterals 9 r e c 100 d r a where r e c is the index of the emitter clogging risk 2 4 data analysis method in this paper sas software was applied to analyze the variance and search for significant differences in the influence of different irrigation times on the index of emitter clogging risk the formation speed of ds and as particle size composition mineral composition change and microbial environment when the significance level was p 0 05 the values among treatments were considered to be significantly different the figures were plotted with originpro 2016 to observe the effects of different irrigation times on the laterals environment directly based on which the effects on the clogging of the emitter were analyzed 3 results and analysis 3 1 mass of the deposited sediment ds and adhered sediment as figs 2 and 3 respectively show the ds mass and change rate of the ds mass and the as mass and change rate of the as mass in the laterals for the different irrigation times the ds mass in the laterals increased substantially while the change rate decreased with extension of the irrigation time the decline rate of the ds mass was 3 69 3 78 time from 1 to 5 irrigations 1 45 time in the 7th irrigation and sharply decreased to 0 69 time in the 30th irrigation this result indicates that the ds mass in the irrigation water was continuously deposited at the bottom of the lateral section during the irrigation process but the key deposition period was the initial stage of irrigation the initial 7 irrigations the variation in as mass was basically similar to that in ds mass the change rate of the as mass increased first and reached a maximum value of 0 036 g time in the 7th irrigation then change rate of the as mass decreased the anova results indicated that the maximum adhesion mass change rate is most likely attained as a result of treatment t7 which exhibits a significant difference transition point of the as 3 2 particle size composition fig 4 shows the correlation between the particle size dr and volume content vr of the different treatments i e lg dr lg vr the sediment volume and sediment particle size exhibited a good linear relationship r2 0 85 p 0 01 indicating that the surface morphology of the sediment in the laterals had significant fractal characteristics the fractal dimension is one of the most typical indicators that characterize the variation in sediment particle size composition yang et al 2008 li et al 2012 ahmadi et al 2011 the fractal dimension is positively correlated with the sediment clay and silt contents and negatively correlated with the sand content fig 5 shows the fractal dimension of the sediment for the different treatments because coarse particles are easily deposited in the laterals due to gravity at the initial irrigation stage and then flocculation and the sediment effect of fine particles have steadily increased with the extension of irrigation the fractal dimension of the lateral sediment basically shows a fluctuating trend of increase with extension of the irrigation time p 0 05 in addition the irrigation time has a vital effect on the sediment particle size composition 3 3 mineral composition x ray diffraction patterns of the ds and as samples for the different treatments were acquired and refined by topas software to obtain the contents of mineral components the diffraction spectrum is shown in fig 6 the results showed that the ds and as mineral compositions were consistent mainly including quartz albite microcline calcite dolomite muscovite clinochlore illite and amphibole according to the particle size of the mineral components and the crystalline morphology of the inter laminar layer the mineral components were divided into viscous and non viscous components the content of each component is shown in table 3 the fraction of viscous components in the sediment was smaller than 20 of the total composition with the non viscous components accounting for more than 80 of the total composition this result means that non viscous minerals are the main components in the sediment the viscous mineral composition in ds was 19 47 53 81 lower than that of the as and the non viscous mineral composition was 3 90 8 37 higher which means that the proportion of viscous components increases as the adhesion process on the lateral wall continues additionally the proportion of viscous components increases the reliability of the results was judged by the fitting line and r factor on the one hand as shown in fig 6 all the samples had fitting lines that are generally flat with occasional micro peak fluctuations at certain locations which indicate a perfect fitting effect and high matching degree between the calculated and original spectra on the other hand table 4 shows that the sample fitting values rp are all less than 15 and the goodness of fit gof is less than 5 so the quantitative analysis results in this paper have excellent reliability 3 4 bacterial analysis fig 7 shows the change in bacterial content in the sediment when irrigation had finished for the different irrigation times there was no significant difference in the bacterial content among the different irrigation times indicating that the bacterial content in the sediment was at a stable level even though the systems had experienced different irrigation times the bacterial content in the as decreased first and then increased with extension of the irrigation time and reached the minimum logarithmic value of the bacterial content in the 7th irrigation significance analysis showed that the bacterial content of the as for the different irrigation times had a significant difference p 0 05 which indicates that the development of bacteria may exhibit some variations in different irrigation process periods the as is a relatively stable structure formed by the interactions of the flocculation of fine particles microbial and biofilms therefore bacteria and their secretions are important components of as notably the bacterial content of the as was 6 67 22 85 higher than that of the ds at the same irrigation time 3 5 index of the emitter clogging risk the index of the emitter clogging risk for the different irrigation times is shown in fig 8 compared rec with emitter 1 to that with emitter 2 the former values were all about 44 47 69 81 less than the latter values the index of the emitter clogging risk gradually decreased with prolonged irrigation time additionally the rate of change of rec exhibited a declining trend before the 7th irrigation time and suddenly increased until the 10th irrigation time then it decreased this finding suggests that the flow rate sharply decreases between the 7th and 10th irrigation times the anova result by duncan s multiple comparison model for the index of the emitter clogging risk showed that the difference in rec among the different irrigation times was extremely significant p 0 01 additionally the irrigation time is an important factor affecting the emitter clogging risk the results of pairwise comparison showed that there was no significant difference between t3 and t7 nor between t10 and t30 indicating that there was no significant difference in emitter clogging risk during certain irrigation time ranges the differences between the rest of the treatments were all significant indicating that a significant difference in emitter clogging risk existed between the short and long irrigation times the boundary between the short and long irrigation times was approximately 7 and 10 times that of irrigation as a result an optimum point for lateral flushing exists in an irrigation system watered with this kind of water and this point is the boundary between the short and long irrigation times in other words if flushing events happen too frequently the anti clogging effects may not be obvious but considerable economic waste may occur due to flushing operations however if the flushing frequency is too low the flushing effect on anti clogging may limited and an irreversible stage may be reached ravina et al 1997 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the pearson correlation analysis results in table 5 showed that rec was significantly correlated with the ds mass as mass change rate of the as mass and fractal dimension α 0 01 respectively in addition both the as mass and change rate of the as mass were correlated with the bacterial content in the as α 0 05 since the ds mass as mass fractal dimension mineral composition and bacterial content were the indexes selected to represent the change in the lateral inner environment the results indicate that rec was affected by the lateral inner environment further illuminations will be put forward in the discussion 4 discussion 4 1 deposited sediment and emitter clogging risk the emitters are evenly distributed on the tube and the lateral flow decreases from the head to the end therefore suspended solids are gradually deposited at the bottom of the circular section of the laterals lateral sedimentation is closely related to the pipe diameter inlet flow rate sediment concentration particle density and particle size distribution shannon et al 1982 james 1984 zhou and dong 2000 li et al 2015 the pearson analysis results indicate that there is a strong linear relationship between the sediment mass and rec as well as the fractal dimension and rec fig 9 on the one hand the increasing ds mass not only leads to a higher hydraulic loss caused by friction but also increases the emitter clogging risk and decreases the emitter flow rate these issues are probably due to the unique filter design of the emitter inlet which has many independent grid structures that are easily filled with fine particles the sediment continues to accumulate in the laterals and easily blocks the inlet as the thickness increases which means that the emitter clogging risk will increase with increasing sedimentation in the laterals if the height of the inlet is too high and the depth of the buffer area is too deep the energy dissipating effect on the water flow will be too strong to pass the sediment particles xie et al 2015 it may be one reason why rec with emitter 2 is higher than that with emitter 1 on the other hand because of the higher proportion of fine particles in the ds the fractal dimension increases with the irrigation times as shown in fig 5 and the increase in the agglomeration force among the particles as irrigation continues fine particle deposition in the laterals steadily increases and coarse particle flow out of the system through the labyrinth channel increases the passage of coarse particles through the labyrinth channel may add to the emitter clogging risk under this condition lateral flushing was effective in minimizing sediment accumulation which in turn helped reduce emitter clogging n li et al 2019 y k li et al 2019 4 2 adhered sediment and emitter clogging risk microbial activity and mineral composition variation lead to changes in the as mass in the laterals and are important factors influencing the emitter clogging risk sediment was found to adhere to the walls of the laterals so firmly that it was difficult to wash the sediment out by lateral flushing although the as mass was only approximately 1 of the ds mass the as was difficult to separate from the lateral wall notably the fluid shearing force near the lateral wall was still weak during the irrigation period therefore the shearing force mainly promotes the flocculation of the viscous particles silicate in the sediment rather than destruction katz et al 2014 as a result flocculation development is strengthened in addition the flow rate near the lateral wall is small when there is friction between the fluid and lateral wall and large flocs are easily deposited it has also been found that the addition of inorganic particles plays an important role in the formation of plugs and biofilms tarchitzky et al 2013 so that flocculated particles adhere to the laterals walls upon deposition during the irrigation interval under the influence of gravity and the viscous extracellular polymer secreted by microorganisms the as cannot be removed from the lateral wall only by flushing with water an increase in the as mass should have reduced the emitter clogging risk for less sediment entering the emitter labyrinth channel however the results showed a good positive correlation between the as mass and rec fig 10 one possible reason may be that increasing the as captures a large amount of nutrients and provides a suitable environment for the growth of bacteria lequette et al 2019 in the laterals which increases the clogging risk at the same time the lateral wall and emitter labyrinth channel are both made of pvc materials and have the same environment the lateral wall and emitter labyrinth channel have the same adhesion ability there is no doubt that semi permanent as is present in the inlet grid and labyrinth channel which irreversibly clogs them therefore the emitter clogging risk increases again the viscous components silicate in the as are more abundant than those in the ds while the non viscous components quartz and carbonate are less abundant than those in the as with extension of the irrigation time and the gradual increase in ds fine particles adhere firmly to the bottom of the lateral wall and then transform into sticky sediment which is difficult to wash away the continuous water flow in the lateral determines that the viscous components are always in a state of constant development at the initial stage of irrigation the viscous components easily adhere to the lateral wall because the contact area between the lateral wall and the sediment is sufficiently large therefore the viscous components gradually increase and the surface of the lateral wall is completely covered an adhesive layer is formed because the adsorption ability of the adhesive layer is better than that of the lateral wall the proportion of non viscous components in the as increases as irrigation continues however the structure of the as has large voids allowing fine viscous particles to adhere and another adhesion cycle starts therefore the proportions of viscous and non viscous components exhibit a cycle with extension of the irrigation and the sedimentation on the laterals maintains a steadily increasing trend hence the emitter clogging risk increases 4 3 effect of lateral flushing lateral anti clogging measures such as lateral flushing can reduce sedimentation of the laterals and lower the possibility of inlet clogging lateral flushing also removes the bacteria living in the lateral sediment and the biofilm produced by microbial activities from the lateral thus preventing physico chemical biological reactions during intermittent irrigation at the same time lateral flushing changes the lateral environment during the operation of the drip irrigation system and reduces the adhesion direction of the clogging material by reducing the fine sediment particles and affecting the mineral components to lower the flocculation rate and inhibit the formation of clogging substances therefore the emitter clogging risk decreases in addition lateral flushing changes the ds and the microbial environment rather than the as song et al 2017 han et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 likewise in the drip irrigation system fed by reclaimed and brackish water as well as hard water the concentrations of calcium magnesium iron manganese and other ions are so abundant that dense clogging substances such as calcium and magnesium compounds are easily formed and adhered to the surface of the lateral wall and the labyrinth channel during physicochemical processes such as crystallization and precipitation thus promoting the occurrence of clogging under these conditions lateral flushing can not change the lateral environment so its effect on reducing the emitter clogging risk is greatly diminished in this case other measures such as replacing the laterals or adding acid and chlorine song et al 2017 green et al 2018 song et al 2019 or microorganisms eroglu et al 2012 to the water source should be addressed to ensure normal operation of the drip irrigation system in this paper the relationship between the irrigation time and lateral environment has been explored and some preliminary conclusions have been drawn however considering that emitter clogging is a complex phenomenon it is also necessary to consider the water quality emitter type irrigation environment and other relevant factors in clogging risk assessment which could provide reasonable operation management information for farmers and irrigation district managers under certain conditions specially the laterals were 6 m in this research based on test site limitations the emitter clogging risk at different positions in the laterals was highly variable because the changes in the lateral environment differed for instance emitters at the end of the section were most likely to be clogged puig bargués et al 2005 therefore the lateral length should be taken into account in further research about the lateral environment in the future 5 conclusion to explore the lateral environment changes for different irrigation times four different irrigation times 3 7 10 and 30 times were established and the deposited sediment ds mass adhered sediment as mass mineral composition particle size composition bacterial content and index of the emitter clogging risk were measured the results show the following findings 1 the ds mass increased while the rate of change of the ds mass decreased with the extension of the irrigation time the fractal dimension of the ds showed an increasing tendency with the extension of the irrigation time meaning that the proportion of coarse particles decreased and that of fine particles increased the ds mainly affected the changes in rec through influencing the mass of clogging substances in the grid structures and the particle size across the labyrinth channel there is a sharp decrease in the flow rate between 7 and 10 irrigation times additionally the boundary between the short and long irrigation times was between approximately 7 and 10 times of irrigation which is the optimum lateral flushing period 2 microbial activity and mineral composition variations led to changes in the as mass in the laterals and are important factors that influence the emitter clogging risk the quantity of bacteria in the as first decreased and then increased and significance analysis showed that the irrigation time variations resulted in a significant difference p 0 05 in the bacterial content in the as moreover the results showed a good positive correlation between the as mass and rec the as captures a large amount of nutrients and provides a suitable environment for the growth of bacteria in the laterals the inlet grid and labyrinth channel which increases the clogging risk the viscous mineral composition content of the ds is 19 47 53 81 lower than that of the as at the same irrigation time in addition the changes in the viscous and non viscous component contents may be cyclical as irrigation continues and the as maintains a steadily increasing trend then the emitter clogging risk increases the lateral inner environment changes with the drip irrigation times and lateral flushing should occur to remove the deposited sediment before the adhered sediment occupies the channel and results in irreversible clogging the research results provide some lateral flushing advice for drip irrigation operation declaration of competing interest

10666,emitter clogging is one of the most important limiting factors affecting the promotion of drip irrigation to examine the impact of the irrigation time on the lateral environment and to develop an optimal way to mitigate the emitter clogging risk 4 different irrigation times 3 7 10 and 30 times were examined with each irrigation period lasting 2 daily hours then the lateral inner environment was studied from the perspectives of the mass particle size composition mineral composition microbial content of the sediment in the lateral includes sediment deposited in and adhered to the lateral ds and as respectively the index of the emitter clogging risk was used to indicate the emitter clogging level of the drip irrigation system the results indicated that emitter clogging risk rec was significantly correlated with the ds mass as mass rate of change of the as mass and fractal dimension p 0 01 and the as mass was correlated with the bacterial content in the as p 0 05 this finding indicates that rec was affected by the lateral inner environment the ds affected the changes in rec mainly through influencing the mass of clogging substances in the grid structures and the particle size across the labyrinth channel the increasing as captures nutrients and provides a suitable environment for the growth of bacteria in the laterals inlet grid and labyrinth channel additionally the mass of clogging substances mainly the as increased steadily during the process of particle adhesion which leads to irreversible clogging the rec declined rapidly in the initial stage of irrigation and then gradually decreased over the irrigation duration there was a boundary between short and long irrigation times between irrigation times of approximately 7 and 10 in this research which was the optimum lateral flushing period keywords fractal dimension deposited sediment adhered sediment lateral flushing drip irrigation 1 introduction drip irrigation technology has been greatly developed and applied since the 1960s caldwell et al 1994 camp 1997 wang et al 2018 however the emitter channel is narrow and becomes easily clogged camp 1998 yu et al 2019 once emitters become clogged the performance of the drip irrigation project will decrease and the life of the drip irrigation system will be greatly shortened in addition emitter clogging also lowers the yield and quality of crops warrick and gardner 1983 or and hanks 1992 lamm 2016 to reduce the emitter clogging risk in practical drip irrigation projects multiple filtration equipment types and facilities are generally deployed in the first part of the system which requires large investments and high operation management costs therefore determining a strategy to prevent or slow emitter clogging is a research area of increased interest in this field the diversity of water sources in irrigation areas determines the diversity of emitter clogging types nakayama and bucks 1991 in the case of high hardness of the irrigation water source the combination of the high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions and the bicarbonate ions in water generates a large amount of calcium and magnesium precipitates these precipitates enter the pipe and the emitter and adhere to the wall surface resulting in a rough wall and an adhesion layer until the emitter is completely and irreversibly clogged liu et al 2019 the flow rate of the emitter decreases with the extension of the drip irrigation time and the harder the water quality is the more notable the flow rate decrease is in the integrated water and fertilizer drip irrigation process the addition of urea npk fertilizer and compound fertilizer changes the dynamics and thermodynamic properties of the fluid medium in the flow channel liu et al 2018a the gradual precipitation of fertilizer results in physical blockage with extension of the irrigation time while the adsorption and displacement of the main cations in fertilizers lead to the formation of flocs and chemical precipitates n li et al 2019 y k li et al 2019 thus the emitter flow shows three distinct stages of change including the initial wave equilibrium phase the linear acceleration clogging phase and the clogging mitigation phase liu et al 2018b under reclaimed water irrigation conditions because of the influence of multiple factors such as changes in nutrient transport and hydraulic shearing force the variation in emitter clogging degree shows different sensitive response trends with changes in the solid particulate matter phospholipid fatty acid content and extracellular polymers in the epiphytic biofilm zhou et al 2013 ait mouheb et al 2019 emitter flow changes exhibit three other different stages including the initial wave balance phase the start up linear phase and the accelerated linear phase zhou 2016 in summary most of the simulation and field experiment drip irrigation test results showed an emitter flow decreasing trend with extension of the irrigation time besides it seems the clogging process exhibited an irreversible trend in a long term irrigation duration under most condition so if there is any attempt to solve the clogging problem it is inevitably to make the clogging mechanism clear and then to address the corresponding measures because the lateral inner environment communicates with the emitter the associated changes are closely related to the emitter clogging risk expressed as the emitter flow of the drip irrigation system the ability of laterals to carry suspended solids in the drip irrigation system the critical content of the suspended particulate matter is expressed as the reduction of the emitter flow in the laterals the deposited suspended particles may form larger particle flocs that accumulate at the bottom of the lateral under van der waals gravity forces hydrogen bonding and physicochemical adsorption which increases the frictional resistance of the laterals walls and increases the emitter clogging risk zhou 2000 the particle size composition at different locations is different for example the sediment particles are smaller at the beginning and end of the lateral moreover the sediment particles are larger in the middle segment of the lateral and the middle segment is where emitter blockage begins zhao et al 2010 scholars developed a sediment deposition patterns model james et al 1984 in pipes for predicting the accumulation laws of the sediments in laterals by considering the lateral diameter and flow and hydrophobic concentration as well as the density and particle size of the sediment however the present studies have only separately examined the clogging risk changes for different irrigation durations or the sedimentation laws in the laterals most of these studies fail to combine both aspects in a multi angle approach for example how do the various indicators in laterals change during different irrigation periods what are the effects of lateral environment change on emitter clogging does lateral environment change specifically interfere with the lateral environment to change the clogging process and reduce emitter clogging risk this paper analyses the total mass and mass change ratio in the lateral sediment the particle size and mineral composition of the sediment and the quantity of microorganisms for different irrigation times under yellow river drip irrigation conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and devices 2 1 1 materials the sediment in the drip irrigation system was taken from the floodplain of the yangling section of the weihe river in shaanxi china after removing impurities such as branches and grass on the surface of the riverbed silt surface layer sludge at depths of 0 15 cm was collected and mixed evenly then the sludge was air dried and the sample was sieved using a 0 1 mm screen to obtain the target sediment finally the sediment and water from test drip irrigation water sources were mixed since the sand was filtered with a 0 1 mm screen we regarded the mixing water as the water source through the filtration system approximately 96 to 106 μm in the initial sediment the particle volume fractions of 0 002 mm 0 002 0 005 mm 0 005 0 01 mm 0 01 0 02 mm 0 02 0 05 mm and 0 05 0 1 mm accounted for 10 02 3 27 4 67 13 52 43 65 and 24 86 respectively of the total sediment volume the mineral composition of the sediment was tested by xrd rietveld technology the results are shown in table 1 the test water was tap water used by residents in the yangling demonstration zone four test irrigation water samples from each treatment were analysed with an orion aq3700 multi parameter water quality analyzer thermo scientific beverly ma usa the ph value was 8 111 0 012 the electrical conductivity ec was 550 3 4 41 μs cm and the suspended solid content was 128 3 21 mg l the turbidity was 92 4 72 fau the hardness was 400 8 51 mg l the cod5 content was 23 1 45 mg l the iron ion content was 0 2 mg l the total nitrogen content was 0 02 mg l and the total phosphorus content was 18 0 33 mg l the lateral outer diameter was 16 mm the wall thickness was 0 38 mm and the distance between adjacent emitters was 30 cm there were 24 laterals investigated in this experiment with each treatment including 6 laterals according to practical layout in field the emitter was placed at the bottom of the inner section of the lateral 2 1 2 devices the test platform consisted of intelligent controller systems water storage tanks water pumps stirring devices pressure gauges control valves drip irrigation belts laterals and drain pipes fig 1 the head part monitored the working pressure in real time by a pressure sensor and adjusted the return water flow in time by controlling the electric ball valve opening extent to maintain a stable working pressure at a precision of 1 25 at the same time the opening and closing times of the mixer and the water pump were controlled to ensure the irrigation time each drip tape had a length of 6 m and 20 emitters 2 2 experimental design the test was a short cycle indoor simulation test with 4 different irrigation times namely 3 7 10 and 30 times of irrigation denoted as t3 t7 t10 and t30 to stand for different irrigation times before lateral flushing the irrigation event occurred once a day continually with each irrigation period lasting 2 h each treatment was repeated 3 times the total time of the experiment was 30 days when the irrigation events had finished the inlet and outlet of the laterals were opened to flush the laterals for 5 min at a velocity of 0 99 m s to ensure that the deposited sediment was flushed out of the inner environment li et al 2015 during the flushing process the return valve was adjusted to ensure that the operation pressure was maintained at 100 kpa at the same time the effluent from each lateral was collected in a bucket the collected effluent was allowed to settle for one day and then the supernatant lateral water was poured off to collect the sediment at the bottom of the bucket the sediment that was collected from the bucket was mainly deposited in the bottom of the lateral section and was easy to flush away from the lateral in this research this type of sediment was called deposited sediment ds after lateral flushing the washed laterals were cut into approximately 2 cm segments about 280 cut samples in a lateral except the emitter patch dried with 95 alcohol and then placed in an ultrasonic oscillator for 3 min to obtain the sediment on the lateral wall the collected sediment was called the adhered sediment as in this research the ds and as were shaken with the oscillating machine for 30 min and then 10 ml mixed solution of each sample was collected to determine the number of microorganisms the remaining sediment samples were placed in a tin foil bowl and dried at 75 c for 7 h to calculate the sediment mass and determine the particle size and mineral compositions as was only used for microbial population and mineral composition analyses plastic measuring cups were placed under 6 selected emitters in each lateral for 10 min to measure the emitter flow both at 30 min after irrigation started and at 30 min before the end of irrigation the working pressure of the test system was stable at these stages 2 3 index and detection method for the lateral environment in this paper the lateral environment was characterized by the ds and as mass particle size composition mineral composition and microbial quantity 2 3 1 deposited sediment and adhered sediment mass the sediment mass was measured by the drying method the sediment mass used for microbial analysis was converted according to the same concentration as that before drying the sediment the calculation of the sediment mass is as follows 1 m s m a d m t b 1 10 m a d m t b m b d m a d in the equation m s is the sediment mass g m b d is the mass of the water sediment and tin bowl before drying g m a d is the mass of the sediment and tin bowl after drying g and m t b is the mass of the tin bowl g the change rate of the sediment mass rm refers to the average ds or as mass of each irrigation period and the calculation equation is 2 r m m s t in the equation rm is the change rate of the sediment mass g time and t is the number of irrigations in the different treatments 2 3 2 quantity of bacteria the number of microorganisms was detected by the plate counting method the sample to be tested was diluted to 10 5 and 10 6 dispersed bacteria and then 0 1 ml diluted solution was applied to the medium and cultured in a 28 30 c incubator for 48 h each single cell grew to form a colony that was visible to the naked eye a single colony was considered a single cell in the original sample the culture medium for bacteria was a beef paste peptone agar medium that includes 3 g of beef extract 10 g of peptone 5 g of sodium chloride 12 13 g of agar powder and 1000 ml of water in the environment with a ph of 7 2 7 4 the number of bacteria measured in colony forming units cfu in the sample was converted according to the dilution factor and the sampled inoculum 2 3 3 particle size composition the particle size composition was measured by an apa 2000 laser particle analyzer malvern panalytical malvern uk the sediment in the inner lateral was composed of micro particles with self similar structures particle size and volume the particles had some fractal characteristics the fractal dimension d is an index used to describe the irregularity of complex bodies and reflects the validity of a space occupied by an irregular body dathe et al 2001 yang et al 2017 this index was adopted to indicate the particle size composition of the sediment in this research linear fitting analysis was used to analyse the logarithm values of the particle size dr and volume content vr of the sediment for the different treatments the slope of the fitted straight line was 3 d so that the fractal dimension d could be calculated 3 1 g v r lg d r in the equation vr is the ratio of the cumulative volume of particles whose size is smaller than a certain particle size to the total volume of the sediment and dr is the ratio of the maximum particle size of a certain particle size range to the maximum particle size of the test sample 0 2 mm in this paper 2 3 4 mineral composition diffraction images showing the mineral composition of the sediment were obtained by a brooke x ray diffractometer germany d8 advance a25 with an angular range 10 70 and each step exceeding 5 s liang et al 2015 each compound had its own unique diffraction pattern by comparing the diffraction pattern and the pdf phase card the composition information of the sample could be obtained in this paper phase analysis was performed with jade 6 0 from mdi the mineral composition and corresponding content of the sediment were obtained by rietveld quantitative analysis wang et al 2019 bayuseno and schmahl 2019 using an advanced full spectrum analysis software namely topas academic software v6 australia coelho software company the rietveld method compared the theoretical and calculated values of the full spectrum of x ray powder diffraction by calculating the theoretical diffraction spectrum of the known crystal structure phase and calculating the peak shape and experimental peak shape point by point using a computer program and the least squares method the calculated peak shape was fitted to the experimental peak shape that is the difference between the calculated value of the diffraction intensity and the experimental value was minimized since the rietveld method made full use of the entire x ray diffraction spectrum including all the information of possible overlapping diffraction peaks of the various phases contained in the sample and corrected the structural and non structural parameters of each phase the method overcame the distribution of overlapping peaks and improved the accuracy and reliability of quantitative phase analysis zhang 2019 if the sample contained p phases the content of α phase σ α was 4 σ α m α p m p s α z α m α v α p

when rwp 15 and gof 5 simultaneously huang and li 2012 sediment particles were derived from rock weathering which was generally classified into physical weathering and chemical weathering the products of physical weathering were mainly layered silicates including montmorillonite kaolinite and illite chemical weathering products were mainly framework silicates such as quartz feldspar and calcite different crystal structures led to differences in the physical properties of these products tian et al 2016 wang et al 2007 thus we classified the sediment components into viscous and non viscous minerals 2 3 5 index of the emitter clogging risk the average relative flow rate characterized the overall clogging degree of the entire drip irrigation pipe belt to account for the error caused by the sediment which resulted in higher density of the water source than clear water the ratio of the beginning flow rate to the ending flow rate was defined as the average relative flow value considering the randomness of emitter clogging the index of the emitter clogging risk r e c was characterized by the total flow rate decrease during the whole irrigation period the temperature error was corrected by pei s method pei et al 2014 8 d r a i 1 n q t q i n 100 where dra is the average relative flow qt is the flow rate at the end of irrigation l h qi is the initial flow rate l h and n is the number of emitters measured on the laterals 9 r e c 100 d r a where r e c is the index of the emitter clogging risk 2 4 data analysis method in this paper sas software was applied to analyze the variance and search for significant differences in the influence of different irrigation times on the index of emitter clogging risk the formation speed of ds and as particle size composition mineral composition change and microbial environment when the significance level was p 0 05 the values among treatments were considered to be significantly different the figures were plotted with originpro 2016 to observe the effects of different irrigation times on the laterals environment directly based on which the effects on the clogging of the emitter were analyzed 3 results and analysis 3 1 mass of the deposited sediment ds and adhered sediment as figs 2 and 3 respectively show the ds mass and change rate of the ds mass and the as mass and change rate of the as mass in the laterals for the different irrigation times the ds mass in the laterals increased substantially while the change rate decreased with extension of the irrigation time the decline rate of the ds mass was 3 69 3 78 time from 1 to 5 irrigations 1 45 time in the 7th irrigation and sharply decreased to 0 69 time in the 30th irrigation this result indicates that the ds mass in the irrigation water was continuously deposited at the bottom of the lateral section during the irrigation process but the key deposition period was the initial stage of irrigation the initial 7 irrigations the variation in as mass was basically similar to that in ds mass the change rate of the as mass increased first and reached a maximum value of 0 036 g time in the 7th irrigation then change rate of the as mass decreased the anova results indicated that the maximum adhesion mass change rate is most likely attained as a result of treatment t7 which exhibits a significant difference transition point of the as

exhibited a good linear relationship r2 0 85 p 0 01 indicating that the surface morphology of the sediment in the laterals had significant fractal characteristics the fractal dimension is one of the most typical indicators that characterize the variation in sediment particle size composition yang et al 2008 li et al 2012 ahmadi et al 2011 the fractal dimension is positively correlated with the sediment clay and silt contents and negatively correlated with the sand content fig 5 shows the fractal dimension of the sediment for the different treatments because coarse particles are easily deposited in the laterals due to gravity at the initial irrigation stage and then flocculation and the sediment effect of fine particles have steadily increased with the extension of irrigation the fractal dimension of the lateral sediment basically shows a fluctuating trend of increase with extension of the irrigation time p 0 05 in addition the irrigation time has a vital effect on the sediment particle size composition 3 3 mineral composition x ray diffraction patterns of the ds and as samples for the different treatments were acquired and refined by topas software to obtain the contents of mineral components the diffraction spectrum is shown in fig 6 the results showed that the ds and as mineral compositions were consistent mainly including quartz albite microcline calcite dolomite muscovite clinochlore illite and amphibole according to the particle size of the mineral components and the crystalline morphology of the inter laminar layer the mineral components were divided into viscous and non viscous components the content of each component is shown in table 3 the fraction of viscous components in the sediment was smaller than 20 of the total composition with the non viscous components accounting for more than 80 of the total composition this result means that non viscous minerals are the main components in the sediment the viscous mineral composition in ds was 19 47 53 81 lower than that of the as and the non viscous mineral composition was 3 90 8 37 higher which means that the proportion of viscous components increases as the adhesion process on the lateral wall continues additionally the proportion of viscous components increases the reliability of the results was judged by the fitting line and r factor on the one hand as shown in fig 6 all the samples had fitting lines that are generally flat with occasional micro peak fluctuations at certain locations which indicate a perfect fitting effect and high matching degree between the calculated and original spectra on the other hand table 4 shows that the sample fitting values rp are all less than 15 and the goodness of fit gof is less than 5 so the quantitative analysis results in this paper have excellent reliability 3 4 bacterial analysis fig 7 shows the change in bacterial content in the sediment when irrigation had finished for the different irrigation times there was no significant difference in the bacterial content among the different irrigation times indicating that the bacterial content in the sediment was at a stable level even though the systems had experienced different irrigation times the bacterial content in the as decreased first and then increased with extension of the irrigation time and reached the minimum logarithmic value of the bacterial content in the 7th irrigation significance analysis showed that the bacterial content of the as for the different irrigation times had a significant difference p 0 05 which indicates that the development of bacteria may exhibit some variations in different irrigation process periods the as is a relatively stable structure formed by the interactions of the flocculation of fine particles microbial and biofilms therefore bacteria and their secretions are important components of as notably the bacterial content of the as was 6 67 22 85 higher than that of the ds at the same irrigation time 3 5 index of the emitter clogging risk the index of the emitter clogging risk for the different irrigation times is shown in fig 8 compared rec with emitter 1 to that with emitter 2 the former values were all about 44 47 69 81 less than the latter values the index of the emitter clogging risk gradually decreased with prolonged irrigation time additionally the rate of change of rec exhibited a declining trend before the 7th irrigation time and suddenly increased until the 10th irrigation time then it decreased this finding suggests that the flow rate sharply decreases between the 7th and 10th irrigation times the anova result by duncan s multiple comparison model for the index of the emitter clogging risk showed that the difference in rec among the different irrigation times was extremely significant p 0 01 additionally the irrigation time is an important factor affecting the emitter clogging risk the results of pairwise comparison showed that there was no significant difference between t3 and t7 nor between t10 and t30 indicating that there was no significant difference in emitter clogging risk during certain irrigation time ranges the differences between the rest of the treatments were all significant indicating that a significant difference in emitter clogging risk existed between the short and long irrigation times the boundary between the short and long irrigation times was approximately 7 and 10 times that of irrigation as a result an optimum point for lateral flushing exists in an irrigation system watered with this kind of water and this point is the boundary between the short and long irrigation times in other words if flushing events happen too frequently the anti clogging effects may not be obvious but considerable economic waste may occur due to flushing operations however if the flushing frequency is too low the flushing effect on anti clogging may limited and an irreversible stage may be reached ravina et al 1997 li et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 the pearson correlation analysis results in table 5 showed that rec was significantly correlated with the ds mass as mass change rate of the as mass and fractal dimension α 0 01 respectively in addition both the as mass and change rate of the as mass were correlated with the bacterial content in the as α 0 05 since the ds mass as mass fractal dimension mineral composition and bacterial content were the indexes selected to represent the change in the lateral inner environment the results indicate that rec was affected by the lateral inner environment further illuminations will be put forward in the discussion 4 discussion 4 1 deposited sediment and emitter clogging risk the emitters are evenly distributed on the tube and the lateral flow decreases from the head to the end therefore suspended solids are gradually deposited at the bottom of the circular section of the laterals lateral sedimentation is closely related to the pipe diameter inlet flow rate sediment concentration particle density and particle size distribution shannon et al 1982 james 1984 zhou and dong 2000 li et al 2015 the pearson analysis results indicate that there is a strong linear relationship between the sediment mass and rec as well as the fractal dimension and rec fig 9 on the one hand the increasing ds mass not only leads to a higher hydraulic loss caused by friction but also increases the emitter clogging risk and decreases the emitter flow rate these issues are probably due to the unique filter design of the emitter inlet which has many independent grid structures that are easily filled with fine particles the sediment continues to accumulate in the laterals and easily blocks the inlet as the thickness increases which means that the emitter clogging risk will increase with increasing sedimentation in the laterals if the height of the inlet is too high and the depth of the buffer area is too deep the energy dissipating effect on the water flow will be too strong to pass the sediment particles xie et al 2015 it may be one reason why rec with emitter 2 is higher than that with emitter 1 on the other hand because of the higher proportion of fine particles in the ds the fractal dimension increases with the irrigation times as shown in fig 5 and the increase in the agglomeration force among the particles as irrigation continues fine particle deposition in the laterals steadily increases and coarse particle flow out of the system through the labyrinth channel increases the passage of coarse particles through the labyrinth channel may add to the emitter clogging risk under this condition lateral flushing was effective in minimizing sediment accumulation which in turn helped reduce emitter clogging n li et al 2019 y k li et al 2019 4 2 adhered sediment and emitter clogging risk microbial activity and mineral composition variation lead to changes in the as mass in the laterals and are important factors influencing the emitter clogging risk sediment was found to adhere to the walls of the laterals so firmly that it was difficult to wash the sediment out by lateral flushing although the as mass was only approximately 1 of the ds mass the as was difficult to separate from the lateral wall notably the fluid shearing force near the lateral wall was still weak during the irrigation period therefore the shearing force mainly promotes the flocculation of the viscous particles silicate in the sediment rather than destruction katz et al 2014 as a result flocculation development is strengthened in addition the flow rate near the lateral wall is small when there is friction between the fluid and lateral wall and large flocs are easily deposited it has also been found that the addition of inorganic particles plays an important role in the formation of plugs and biofilms tarchitzky et al 2013 so that flocculated particles adhere to the laterals walls upon deposition during the irrigation interval under the influence of gravity and the viscous extracellular polymer secreted by microorganisms the as cannot be removed from the lateral wall only by flushing with water an increase in the as mass should have reduced the emitter clogging risk for less sediment entering the emitter labyrinth channel however the results showed a good positive correlation between the as mass and rec fig 10 one possible reason may be that increasing the as captures a large amount of nutrients and provides a suitable environment for the growth of bacteria lequette et al 2019 in the laterals which increases the clogging risk at the same time the lateral wall and emitter labyrinth channel are both made of pvc materials and have the same environment the lateral wall and emitter labyrinth channel have the same adhesion ability there is no doubt that semi permanent as is present in the inlet grid and labyrinth channel which irreversibly clogs them therefore the emitter clogging risk increases again the viscous components silicate in the as are more abundant than those in the ds while the non viscous components quartz and carbonate are less abundant than those in the as with extension of the irrigation time and the gradual increase in ds fine particles adhere firmly to the bottom of the lateral wall and then transform into sticky sediment which is difficult to wash away the continuous water flow in the lateral determines that the viscous components are always in a state of constant development at the initial stage of irrigation the viscous components easily adhere to the lateral wall because the contact area between the lateral wall and the sediment is sufficiently large therefore the viscous components gradually increase and the surface of the lateral wall is completely covered an adhesive layer is formed because the adsorption ability of the adhesive layer is better than that of the lateral wall the proportion of non viscous components in the as increases as irrigation continues however the structure of the as has large voids allowing fine viscous particles to adhere and another adhesion cycle starts therefore the proportions of viscous and non viscous components exhibit a cycle with extension of the irrigation and the sedimentation on the laterals maintains a steadily increasing trend hence the emitter clogging risk increases 4 3 effect of lateral flushing lateral anti clogging measures such as lateral flushing can reduce sedimentation of the laterals and lower the possibility of inlet clogging lateral flushing also removes the bacteria living in the lateral sediment and the biofilm produced by microbial activities from the lateral thus preventing physico chemical biological reactions during intermittent irrigation at the same time lateral flushing changes the lateral environment during the operation of the drip irrigation system and reduces the adhesion direction of the clogging material by reducing the fine sediment particles and affecting the mineral components to lower the flocculation rate and inhibit the formation of clogging substances therefore the emitter clogging risk decreases in addition lateral flushing changes the ds and the microbial environment rather than the as song et al 2017 han et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 likewise in the drip irrigation system fed by reclaimed and brackish water as well as hard water the concentrations of calcium magnesium iron manganese and other ions are so abundant that dense clogging substances such as calcium and magnesium compounds are easily formed and adhered to the surface of the lateral wall and the labyrinth channel during physicochemical processes such as crystallization and precipitation thus promoting the occurrence of clogging under these conditions lateral flushing can not change the lateral environment so its effect on reducing the emitter clogging risk is greatly diminished in this case other measures such as replacing the laterals or adding acid and chlorine song et al 2017 green et al 2018 song et al 2019 or microorganisms eroglu et al 2012 to the water source should be addressed to ensure normal operation of the drip irrigation system in this paper the relationship between the irrigation time and lateral environment has been explored and some preliminary conclusions have been drawn however considering that emitter clogging is a complex phenomenon it is also necessary to consider the water quality emitter type irrigation environment and other relevant factors in clogging risk assessment which could provide reasonable operation management information for farmers and irrigation district managers under certain conditions specially the laterals were 6 m in this research based on test site limitations the emitter clogging risk at different positions in the laterals was highly variable because the changes in the lateral environment differed for instance emitters at the end of the section were most likely to be clogged puig bargués et al 2005 therefore the lateral length should be taken into account in further research about the lateral environment in the future 5 conclusion to explore the lateral environment changes for different irrigation times four different irrigation times 3 7 10 and 30 times were established and the deposited sediment ds mass adhered sediment as mass mineral composition particle size composition bacterial content and index of the emitter clogging risk were measured the results show the following findings 1 the ds mass increased while the rate of change of the ds mass decreased with the extension of the irrigation time the fractal dimension of the ds showed an increasing tendency with the extension of the irrigation time meaning that the proportion of coarse particles decreased and that of fine particles increased the ds mainly affected the changes in rec through influencing the mass of clogging substances in the grid structures and the particle size across the labyrinth channel there is a sharp decrease in the flow rate between 7 and 10 irrigation times additionally the boundary between the short and long irrigation times was between approximately 7 and 10 times of irrigation which is the optimum lateral flushing period 2 microbial activity and mineral composition variations led to changes in the as mass in the laterals and are important factors that influence the emitter clogging risk the quantity of bacteria in the as first decreased and then increased and significance analysis showed that the irrigation time variations resulted in a significant difference p 0 05 in the bacterial content in the as moreover the results showed a good positive correlation between the as mass and rec the as captures a large amount of nutrients and provides a suitable environment for the growth of bacteria in the laterals the inlet grid and labyrinth channel which increases the clogging risk the viscous mineral composition content of the ds is 19 47 53 81 lower than that of the as at the same irrigation time in addition the changes in the viscous and non viscous component contents may be cyclical as irrigation continues and the as maintains a steadily increasing trend then the emitter clogging risk increases the lateral inner environment changes with the drip irrigation times and lateral flushing should occur to remove the deposited sediment before the adhered sediment occupies the channel and results in irreversible clogging the research results provide some lateral flushing advice for drip irrigation operation declaration of competing interest

efficiency this study aimed to investigate the effects of different irrigation and nitrogen treatments on the growth yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and fertilizer n utilization of tomato plants by using pre buried soil columns 100 cm in depth in a field the irrigation treatments included conventional drip irrigation cdi and alternate partial root zone drip irrigation adi with sufficient or deficient water supply nitrogen fertilizer was set as high and low n input 8 30 g or 4 15 g 15n labeled urea per plant supplied as drip fertigation compared with the cdi treatment at the same nitrogen drip fertigation level adi promoted tomato root growth induced more 15n accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil profile facilitated the absorption of fertilizer 15n as well as soil n by plants thus increasing plant growth and yield as well as iwue and fertilizer n use efficiency while decreased 15n loss low nitrogen supply decreased plant growth yield 15n absorption 15n accumulation in soil profile and iwue but increased both the 15n use efficiency and 15n loss percentage thus adi coupled with nitrogen fertigation has a potential to save irrigation water increase use efficiencies of both water and nitrogen fertilizers with reduced loss of n to the environment keywords alternate partial root zone drip irrigation nitrogen fertigation fertilized nitrogen utilization 15n irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of fresh water resources the competition for limited freshwater supplies among different water consumers agriculture industry and domestic creates a considerable need for continuous improvements for irrigation practices in crop production in the world especially in northern china where fresh water for irrigated agriculture is becoming unavailable fan et al 2012 moreover the unpredicted climate change may lead to exacerbated water shortages in the future mancosu et al 2015 despite severe water shortage for agriculture the irrigation water use efficiency is low in china s agricultural production cheng et al 2009 in addition another big concern arisen is overuse of chemical fertilizers in agricultural production system gong et al 2011 in china 29 of the fertilizers worldwide was consumed by the 9 of the arable land larson 2013 the consumption of fertilizers in china had skyrocketed from 0 07 mt in 1950 to 49 6 mt in 2000 and 74 7 of the increase was attributable to high fertilizer application rate chen et al 2018 however the recovery efficiency of applied n fertilizer was merely 30 35 and even below 30 for major cereal crops in recent years in china zhu and chen 2002 yan et al 2014 leading to serious environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emission nitrate leaching and groundwater pollution and runoff loss for water eutrophication zhu and chen 2002 gong et al 2011 sutton et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to increase irrigation water and fertilizer nutrient use efficiency for agricultural sustainability alternate partial root zone irrigation apri including alternate partial root zone drip irrigation adi is a water saving irrigation technique using alternate wetting and drying of the root zones kang and zhang 2004 kirda et al 2007 dodd et al 2008 and has caught considerable attention worldwide in recent years wang et al 2017 zhen et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that apri can save 30 50 of irrigation water without significant reduction in yield and increase wue and have been used for many crops such as grape dos santos et al 2003 potato shahnazari et al 2008 cotton du et al 2008 maize fu et al 2017 and tomato giuliani et al 2017 numerous studies have shown that apri sometimes coupled with nitrogen fertilization can promote crop n uptake and n use efficiency nue decrease the leaching of nitrate and thus increase the nitrate accumulation in top soil profiles and this reduces the risk of groundwater pollution by nitrate shahnazari et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 liang et al 2013 fu et al 2017 however most of the studies did not distinguish the source of nitrogen in these processes skinne et al 1998 shahnazari et al 2008 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 zhang et al 2014 in recent years the fate of the residual n in specific soil layers as affected by apri was elucidated by using 15n labeled techniques wang et al 2014 2019 hou et al 2017 by labeling 15n it was found that compared with the conventional irrigation 15n leaching was reduced and 61 3 of 15n pre labeled in the 40 50 cm soil layer was promoted to move upward to 0 40 cm layer under apri wang et al 2014 drip fertigation is convenient in supplying water and fertilizer directly to the root zone with high efficiency previous studies have shown that both drip fertigation and adi have beneficial effects on improving crop dry mass accumulation yield n uptake and wue and nue e g rajput and patel 2006 bhat et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 liang et al 2013 topak et al 2016 wang et al 2017 sezen et al 2019 however the impact of combined application of adi and n fertigation on crop yield wue n uptake and the fate of fertilizer n remain unclear it is hypothesized that adi with n fertilization can improve the growth wue and nue of tomato plants in the present study the n isotopic technique was used to quantify the n migration within the soil profile and utilization by tomato under alternate partial root zone drip irrigation the outcome of the present study would provide a theoretical basis for efficient utilization of water and n fertilizer under alternate partial root zone drip irrigation and as well as theoretical guidance for the agricultural practices to save both water and nitrogen fertilizer 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse located at xuji village 116 46 e 33 58 n duji district huaibei city china from february to june 2017 this site has typical warm temperate humid climate with annual average rainfall of 830 mm and annual average relative humidity of 71 the annual average air temperature is 14 4 c with an annual average frost free period of 202 days and 2316 sunshine hours the soil was sandy loam and the basic physical and chemical properties for the 0 20 cm soil layer were shown in table 1 2 2 experimental treatments the experiment was performed in soil columns that were pre buried in the experimental field the soil column was made following the method described in our previous studies wang et al 2014 2019 with slight modifications a homemade cylindrical aluminum drum with a height of 110 cm was used instead of the polyethylene film 0 15 mm thick the drum without bottom was buried in the soil to a depth of 100 cm to form the column the soils in the 0 20 cm layer per column were uniformly mixed with different dosage of fertilizers to provide nutrients including phosphorus p2o5 potassium k2o and microelements before backfilling without nitrogen for adi treatment a plastic film separator with a gap of 5 cm 5 cm size cut in the center was buried in the middle of each soil column to the depth of 0 20 cm forming two equal root compartments in the top soil layer the soil columns treated with conventional drip irrigation cdi were not separated by plastic film separators n fertilizer was 15n labeled urea with 15n abundance of 15 21 supplied by shanghai research institute of chemical industry china via simulated fertigation after onset of treatments water was supplied with a 5 l plastic bucket hanging 1 8 m above soil surface and introduced into the root zone through a medical infusion tube with needles on february 28th 2017 uniform 50 day old seedlings of tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill cv zhongyan no 988 were transferred in the center of the soil columns to make sure that the roots of plants were distributed evenly into the two soil compartments the seedlings were irrigated as cdi before the water and nitrogen treatment was initiated to reduce soil evaporation the columns were covered with plastic films after transplanting twenty eight days after transplanting i e on march 28th the plants were subject to different water and nitrogen treatments the experiment included irrigation and n fertilization treatments and the detailed experimental design was shown in table 2 each treatment was repeated four times in addition two for c100 100 treatment or one for the other four treatments additional soil columns for each treatment with a polyvinyl chloride pvc monitoring pipe buried down to 100 cm soil depth was set up to monitor soil water contents wang et al 2014 2019 there were 25 soil columns in total the irrigation amount m in the sufficient water treatment c100 100 was calculated as m sρbphθf q1 q2 where s is the surface area of the soil column diameter of 45 cm pb is the soil bulk density p is the wetting proportion 0 8 h is the depth of wetting layer i e 0 20 cm of the top soil during the seedling stage or 0 40 cm after the flowering stage θf is the field water capacity 26 q1 and q2 are the upper and lower limit of soil water levels respectively the lower and upper limits of soil water levels were set as 65 and 90 of field water capacity respectively when the soil water content dropped to the lower limit water was supplemented to the predefined upper limit of soil water level the irrigation amount for the deficit irrigation treatment equaled to 1 2 m for the cdi treatment the irrigation water was applied through the needle that was set 5 cm away from the plant penetrating through the plastic film for the adi treatment irrigation water was applied only to one compartment by the needle inserted in the center of the compartment and allowed the other compartment to dry the irrigation was then alternated to the previously drying compartment at next irrigation event letting the formerly irrigated compartment to dry the alternation of the irrigation in the two soil compartments was repeated in turn in the treatment with high n supply 8 30 g urea for each column was supplied based on the assumption of providing 240 kg n ha 1 in the field n fertilizers were delivered into the soil by fertigation during the treatment period in each n fertigation event 0 830 g or 0 415 g 15n labeled urea was dissolved in water and drip irrigated into the soil column through the needle for respectively high n or low n fertilizer treatment the interval for n fertigation was 5 10 days depending on the soil water contents in the soil columns there were five alternate wetting drying cycles in the adi treatments before the harvest of plants the dynamics of soil water content was monitored daily with tdr moisture probes trime pico iph tdr imko germany wang et al 2014 2019 to minimize as much as possible the possible positional influence of light and temperature differences the columns were all set in one row 2 m apart from the edge of the greenhouse 15 cm apart from each other the columns for each treatment were randomly arranged in the row the total irrigation amount was 64 1 l for c100 100 treatment and 39 6 l for each column with low irrigation including 15 1 l of water irrigated for each soil column before the initiation of different n fertigation treatments thus the low irrigation treatment reduced the irrigation water amount by 38 2 compared with the c100 100 treatment 2 3 samplings measurements and analyses fruits were harvested successively and timely at maturity on june 25 2017 the leaves stems and final batch of fruits were collected and weighed all the leaves stems and fruits were oven dried at 105 c for 30 min immediately after sampling and then kept at 70 c until constant weight dried plant samples were ground and sieved through a 1 mm sieve for the determination of nutrient and 15n concentration after the harvest of plants the soils in the soil columns were excavated in each 20 cm depth and roots in the 0 60 cm soil layers were collected by using tweezers wang et al 2014 2019 after root collection the soil was thoroughly mixed in each 20 cm layer and sampled the soil water content was determined the soil samples were dried for the analysis of total n and 15n concentrations the root samples were washed thoroughly with tap water and sterile distilled water subsequently the root samples were scanned by a root scanner epson perfection v700 photo epson japan and the root images were analyzed by winrhizo software regent instruments inc quebec canada finally the root samples were oven dried

treatments on dry biomass yield and iwue under cdi the dry biomass of stem leaf vegetative organs and fruit and fresh fruit yield decreased significantly with decrease of water and or nitrogen supplied table 3 adi increased biomass of each organ and increased the dry weight and fresh weight of fruits by 6 1 and 6 4 respectively compared with cdi at the same level of water and nitrogen supply compared to c100 100 a50 100 only decreased fruit dry and fresh weight by 9 1 and 6 2 respectively the iwue in the adi and cdi treatments increased significantly compared with the control c100 100 under the same water level adi had significantly higher iwue compared with cdi in addition reduced n supply decreased iwue significantly under either cdi or adi the highest iwue was found in a50 100 being 57 higher than that of c100 100 table 3 3 2 effects of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on root growth and distribution the root weight and length decreased with increasing soil depth and about 70 of the total root weight and more than 50 of the total root length were distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layer regardless of the treatment fig 1 a and b under cdi decreasing the amount of water and or nitrogen supply significantly decreased the root weight in the 0 20 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers the lowest total root weight was observed in c50 50 which was 19 lower compared with c100 100 fig 1a and c water or nitrogen supply didn t affect root length distribution in 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers significantly among cdi treatments however root length in the 0 20 cm and the total root length under the c50 100 and c50 50 treatments were significantly lower than that of c100 100 fig 1b and d in adi reducing n supply by 50 didn t affect total root weight total root length and their distribution down the soil profile except a decrease in root weight in 40 60 cm under the a50 50 treatment compared with its cdi counterparts adi increased root weight in 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers and also root length in 40 60 cm soil layer the total root weight or root length was similar between a50 100 and a50 100 fig 1c and d similarly there was no significant difference in total root weight among the treatments of a50 100 a50 50 and c100 100 however total root length in a50 100 and a50 50 treatments decreased by 6 9 compared with that in the c100 100 treatment fig 1c and d 3 3 effects of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on n and 15n accumulation in plants compared with c100 100 the c50 100 treatment significantly decreased n accumulation in stems and leaves as well as total plant n accumulation but had no significant influence on n accumulation in the roots and fruits table 4 the 15n accumulation in each organ and the whole plant decreased except in root where a 13 6 increment was observed in c50 100 compared with c100 100 treatment table 5 in the treatments with the same irrigation amount the decrease of n supply decreased both n and 15n accumulation in different organs and also in the whole plant c50 100 vs c50 50 tables 4 and 5 however the 15n use efficiency in c50 50 treatment was higher than that in c50 100 treatment but it was lower compared with c100 100 treatment table 5 compared with cdi with the same n levels adi increased n and 15n accumulation and 15n use efficiency in the stems leaves fruits and the whole plant the a50 100 and a50 50 treatments increased n accumulation by 11 5 and 14 7 as well as 15n accumulation by 10 6 and 10 0 respectively compared with c50 100 and c50 50 tables 4 and 5 under the same n level compared with cdi root n and 15n accumulation were significantly decreased in a50 100 but in a50 50 the n accumulation in the roots were higher while 15n accumulation was similar compared with cdi treatment these results indicated that the transfer of fertilizer n from roots to shoots and especially to fruits under adi was promoted under high n supply but was limited under low n input tables 4 and 5 the total n accumulation under a50 100 was not significantly different from that of c100 100 even though the irrigation amount was reduced by 50 in a50 100 after onset of the treatments however the total 15n accumulation and 15n use efficiency decreased by 16 3 in a50 100 compared with that of c100 100 3 4 effects of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on the 15n distribution in various soil layers in the 0 20 cm top surface soil layer the amount of 15n accumulation accounted on average for 74 5 of the total 15n accumulated in the 0 100 cm soil profile this percentage for the treatment of c100 100 decreased to 60 2 and was the lowest among the treatments the amount of 15n accumulation in the 0 20 cm top soil layer was significantly higher under high n supply c100 100 c50 100 and a50 100 than under low n supply c50 50 and a50 50 fig 2 under high n supply the amount of 15n accumulation in the 0 20 cm soil layer under c100 100 was reduced by averaged 49 1 compared with the c50 100 and a50 100 treatments whereas only little difference in 15n accumulation was observed between the latter two treatments there were large differences in 15n accumulation in the 20 40 cm soil layer among treatments fig 2 and the accumulation amounts in c100 100 a50 100 and c50 100 were 35 73 31 65 and 23 35 mg per soil column respectively however the amount of 15n accumulation in the 20 40 cm soil layer in the c50 50 and a50 50 treatments was only 6 95 and 11 50 mg per layer respectively in the 40 60 cm soil layer 15n accumulation in the c100 100 treatment was significantly higher than in other treatments fig 2 the amount of 15n accumulation in the soil layer below 60 cm soil depth in all five treatments was low with no differences among treatments fig 2 3 5 effects of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on the 15n accumulation and recovery and its loss from soil column the 15n accumulation total recovery and loss of 15n per column was significantly higher under high n c100 100 c50 100 and a50 100 than low n supply c50 50 and a50 50 and in the former treatments they were on average 1 36 1 15 and 0 63 times higher than those in the latter treatments table 6 however the 15n loss percentage was high in treatments with low n supply under cdi compared with c100 100 the c50 100 treatment increased 15n accumulation in the soil profile but decreased the recovery amount of 15n thus increasing the loss amount and percentage of 15n from the soil column the highest n loss percentage was found in the c50 50 treatment which was 34 3 irrespective of its lowest loss amount among the three cdi treatments table 6 under the same irrigation and n application treatments adi significantly increased the accumulation and total recovery amount of 15n but significantly decreased the loss amount and loss percentage of 15n when compared with cdi irrespective of the accumulation amount the accumulation percentage in the c100 100 was the lowest among the treatments in addition adi significantly increased the 15n accumulation percentage compared with the relative cdi treatment the 15n accumulation percentage decreased with the reduction of n application amount data not shown however the 15n loss percentage increased significantly with a decrease in n application rate under the same irrigation amount regardless of whether cdi or adi treatments under cdi c50 50 and c100 100 treatments showed the highest and lowest 15n loss percentage respectively table 6 the lowest 15n loss percentage was observed in a50 50 treatments 21 1 among all the treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on yield and wue earlier studies have documented that apri including adi can reduce irrigation water consumption and improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue without a significant yield loss and even in some cases the yield of plants increases in comparison with conventional irrigation e g zhang et al 2014 fu et al 2017 giuliani et al 2017 jovanovic and stikic 2018 in accordance with this in the present study the c50 100 and a50 100 treatments decreased the yield by 10 9 and 6 1 whereas increased iwue by 44 17 and 51 63 respectively compared with the c100 100 treatment table 3 in addition the yield and iwue was higher in adi than its cdi counterparts table 3 such effects could be attributed to a wide range of apri specific positive responses in plants in adi repeated alternation of wetting drying cycles in the root systems could increase the synthesis and alter the redistribution of abscisic acid aba increase ph in xylem sap and induce variation in hydraulic pressure which narrow stomatal opening and thereby reduce transpiration loss while photosynthesis is not significantly affected thus leading to increased crop iwue kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2008 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 in addition adi could decrease the wet soil surface area and thus reduce soil evaporation furthermore adi could increase lateral infiltration of soil water and decrease vertical water percolation leaving more irrigated water in the upper soil layer where plant roots are mainly concentrated in these are more conducive to plant water absorption and utilization thereby resulting in increased iwue pan et al 2002 kang and zhang 2004 the total vegetative growth of tomato plants in a50 100 and a50 50 decreased significantly compared with c100 100 whereas the total root weight was not significantly different among these treatments fig 1 leading to increased root to shoot ratio in a50 100 and a50 50 treatments data not shown previous studies reported that apri can improve root growth and function i e increasing root surface area root length density and root hair development induced by apri wang et al 2014 chen et al 2016 wang et al 2019 and apri could also promote the transfer of assimilates from shoots to roots stimulate the compensatory growth of roots induced by the repeated drying wetting cycles and improve the aeration of irrigated soil see reviews by kang and zhang 2004 in addition to enhanced root growth it was found that the root distribution was also changed down soil profile by apri as shown in fig 1a and b more roots in terms of root weight or root length were distributed in deeper soil layers promotion of root growth and root distribution in deeper soil layers by apri was also found in eggplant zhang et al 2014 and corn wang et al 2014 li et al 2014 this facilitated absorption of water and nutrients from deeper soil layers providing plants with stable environment for water absorption and increased soil volume for uptake of nutrients in addition the root vigor and root hydraulic conductivity that contributes greatly to crop water uptake were noticeably enhanced by apri hu et al 2005 chen et al 2016 and such compensation could be partly attributed to the newly formed roots and also partly to the old roots that undergo some changes when exposed to rewetting again these morphological and physiological adaptations of roots under apri are beneficial for plant absorption of water and nutrients from soil and could ensure plant growth and yield formation under apri even though the irrigation amount and nitrogen supply were reduced substantially li et al 2011 dodd et al 2015 liu et al 2017 4 2 effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on n uptake and nue even though the biomass of vegetative organs and fruits in the a50 100 treated plants was lower than in c100 100 sufficiently fertigated plants the n concentration data not shown and n accumulation did not decline in stems leaves fruits and total plants tables 3 and 4 in addition n accumulation in shoots or in total plant in the a50 50 did not show significant differences even though only half amount of n fertilizer was supplied compared with c50 100 treatment in contrast the n content in roots was lower in a50 100 and a50 50 than c100 100 and c50 100 treatments these findings indicated that adi enhanced n uptake by roots and promoted transfer of n from roots to shoots and fruits compared with cdi adi enhanced root vigor and growth and distribution in deeper soil as discussed above which might have promoted n absorption in addition apri could stimulate the soil organic c and n mineralization as compared with conventional irrigation shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the drying and wetting cycles of the soil induced by apri stimulated microbial activities and soil respiration rate leading to a flush of mineral n into the soil solution and thus increased plant n accumulation shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2010 compared with c100 100 and c50 100 total n absorption did not differ significantly but the 15n absorption was decreased by 16 3 and 41 1 respectively in the treatments of a50 100 and a50 50 tables 4 and 5 indicating that adi increased more absorption of soil sourced n in addition compared with cdi the increment rate in 15n absorption 10 3 in adi tended to be lower than that in total n accumulation 13 1 especially under low n application calculated from tables 4 and 5 as elucidated above these indicated that adi could promote absorption of nitrogen especially from soil sourced nitrogen under low n input which was consistent with the previous findings sun et al 2013 sun et al 2013 found that soil 13c isotope composition δ13c was significantly higher in apri than in conventional irrigation especially under conditions of low n input in addition plant δ15n soil sourced n tended to be higher in apri than in conventional irrigation at each n fertilizer rate and reduced significantly with increasing n fertilization rate based on the notion that soil microbes discriminate 13c during decomposition of soil organic c and leave the soil enriched with 13c balesdent and mariotti 1996 these findings implied that apri stimulated organic c and n mineralization compared with conventional irrigation especially under low n input sun et al 2013 the proportion of 15n accumulated in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm under high water supply was the lowest accounting for 60 2 and the other four treatments with low water supply on average accounted for 78 0 fig 2 these results were consistent with the findings of xing et al 2015 in addition under high n input total 15n accumulation in 0 100 cm soil was lower with high c100 100 than low irrigation c50 100 this is because urea can rapidly be hydrolyzed into ammonium and then ammonium is converted by nitrifying bacteria into nitrate sigurdarson et al 2018 nitrate has a negative charge like soil colloids and is not adsorbed in soil therefore nitrate n in soil migrates together with water the larger the irrigation amount the stronger the nitrate migration in the present study the irrigation treatments had an important impact on n redistribution in the soil adi was more likely to cause more n remaining in the upper layer of soil and reduced n leaching under the same amount of water and n supply 15n contents in both the upper soil layer 0 40 cm and 0 100 cm were significantly higher under adi than cdi and the 15n loss percentage decreased by 25 1 on average in the former compared with the latter table 6 this is because the alternate wetting and drying of the soil under adi could increase the lateral and decrease the vertical migration of soil water thus reducing n leaching in addition cdi keeps high moisture content in the soil surface layer for a long time potentially resulting in anoxic conditions conducive to denitrification thus decreasing nitrate n content in soil han et al 2018 furthermore adi or apri results in lower ammonia volatilization from soil lei et al 2009 han et al 2014 allowing n accumulation in the upper soil layer and thus increasing the chance of n uptake by crop roots wang et al 2014 hou et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the variation in total 15n recovery amount in the plant soil system with different n treatments was almost the same as the changes in 15n accumulation in the soil with an exception in the c100 100 and c50 100 treatments compare with c100 100 c50 100 increased the 15n accumulation in the soil but decreased the total 15n recovery amount table 6 this was associated with promoted plant growth and increased absorption of nitrogen in the high irrigation treatment c100 100 compared with c50 100 treatment table 5 beside plant n uptake and nitrate leaching gaseous n losses including ammonia volatilization and denitrification are also important pathways of n loss from the soil plant system prasad and hochmuth 2016 n losses of 30 38 kg ha 1 through denitrification over the 8 week experiment in the frequently irrigated fields and 0 88 3 52 g ha 1 d 1 through ammonia volatilization in a semi arid rangeland were reported in literature valé et al 2007 xu et al 2010 interestingly compared with c100 100 c50 100 treatment decreased nitrate content in deeper soil layers and left more of n in topsoil fig 2 in addition urea movement down soil profile could be limited in c50 100 moreover plant capacity to absorb n was limited by reduced irrigation tables 4 and 5 these exposed more nitrogen conductive for gaseous n loss leading to increased 15n loss percentage in c50 100 compared with c100 100 treatment table 6 however the highest 15n loss percentage was found in c50 50 treatment although the total amount of n loss was low under low n treatment the proportion of n lost to n applied was relatively high owing to a low n application amount sun et al 2013 reported similar findings in a pot experiment across the two irrigation regimes apri or conventional irrigation with n fertilization rate having no significant effects on total net n loss implying that the n loss percentage could be increased under low fertilizer n application the percentage of 15n loss decreased under apri due to increased plant absorption of fertilizer n as well as reduced nitrate leaching compared with the relevant cdi treatments tables 5 and 6 the reduction in n loss observed in the present study was contradictory to sun et al 2013 whereby apri led to increased net n loss from the soil plant system the difference was probably due to an absence of nitrate leaching in their pot experiment 5 conclusions under the same irrigation and n application amount compared with the cdi treatment adi promoted root growth especially in deeper soil layers adi decreased n leaching while improved 15n accumulation in topsoil soil n mineralization was promoted in adi contributing to enhanced absorption of nitrogen from both soil and n fertilizer adi increased total recovery amount of 15n but significantly reduced the loss amount and loss percentage of fertilizer 15n when compared with cdi under the same nitrogen rate the adi increased yield thus improving iwue high n supply significantly increased 15n accumulation in all organs stems leaves roots and fruits and thus increased total 15n uptake which was beneficial for yield formation and also increased iwue compared with low n supply however high n supply significantly decreased nue and 15n loss percentage under both cdi and adi in summary adi has great potential in saving irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer increasing wue and nue while maintaining yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this study was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant number 31572202 u1710255 and the research foundation for overseas

10667,irrigation and fertilization play key roles in crop production scarcity of available water resources and low nutrient use efficiency calls for a need to improve water and nitrogen n use efficiency this study aimed to investigate the effects of different irrigation and nitrogen treatments on the growth yield irrigation water use efficiency iwue and fertilizer n utilization of tomato plants by using pre buried soil columns 100 cm in depth in a field the irrigation treatments included conventional drip irrigation cdi and alternate partial root zone drip irrigation adi with sufficient or deficient water supply nitrogen fertilizer was set as high and low n input 8 30 g or 4 15 g 15n labeled urea per plant supplied as drip fertigation compared with the cdi treatment at the same nitrogen drip fertigation level adi promoted tomato root growth induced more 15n accumulation in the 0 100 cm soil profile facilitated the absorption of fertilizer 15n as well as soil n by plants thus increasing plant growth and yield as well as iwue and fertilizer n use efficiency while decreased 15n loss low nitrogen supply decreased plant growth yield 15n absorption 15n accumulation in soil profile and iwue but increased both the 15n use efficiency and 15n loss percentage thus adi coupled with nitrogen fertigation has a potential to save irrigation water increase use efficiencies of both water and nitrogen fertilizers with reduced loss of n to the environment keywords alternate partial root zone drip irrigation nitrogen fertigation fertilized nitrogen utilization 15n irrigation water use efficiency 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of fresh water resources the competition for limited freshwater supplies among different water consumers agriculture industry and domestic creates a considerable need for continuous improvements for irrigation practices in crop production in the world especially in northern china where fresh water for irrigated agriculture is becoming unavailable fan et al 2012 moreover the unpredicted climate change may lead to exacerbated water shortages in the future mancosu et al 2015 despite severe water shortage for agriculture the irrigation water use efficiency is low in china s agricultural production cheng et al 2009 in addition another big concern arisen is overuse of chemical fertilizers in agricultural production system gong et al 2011 in china 29 of the fertilizers worldwide was consumed by the 9 of the arable land larson 2013 the consumption of fertilizers in china had skyrocketed from 0 07 mt in 1950 to 49 6 mt in 2000 and 74 7 of the increase was attributable to high fertilizer application rate chen et al 2018 however the recovery efficiency of applied n fertilizer was merely 30 35 and even below 30 for major cereal crops in recent years in china zhu and chen 2002 yan et al 2014 leading to serious environmental problems such as greenhouse gas emission nitrate leaching and groundwater pollution and runoff loss for water eutrophication zhu and chen 2002 gong et al 2011 sutton et al 2011 therefore it is necessary to increase irrigation water and fertilizer nutrient use efficiency for agricultural sustainability alternate partial root zone irrigation apri including alternate partial root zone drip irrigation adi is a water saving irrigation technique using alternate wetting and drying of the root zones kang and zhang 2004 kirda et al 2007 dodd et al 2008 and has caught considerable attention worldwide in recent years wang et al 2017 zhen et al 2019 previous studies have demonstrated that apri can save 30 50 of irrigation water without significant reduction in yield and increase wue and have been used for many crops such as grape dos santos et al 2003 potato shahnazari et al 2008 cotton du et al 2008 maize fu et al 2017 and tomato giuliani et al 2017 numerous studies have shown that apri sometimes coupled with nitrogen fertilization can promote crop n uptake and n use efficiency nue decrease the leaching of nitrate and thus increase the nitrate accumulation in top soil profiles and this reduces the risk of groundwater pollution by nitrate shahnazari et al 2008 zhang et al 2011 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 liang et al 2013 fu et al 2017 however most of the studies did not distinguish the source of nitrogen in these processes skinne et al 1998 shahnazari et al 2008 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 zhang et al 2014 in recent years the fate of the residual n in specific soil layers as affected by apri was elucidated by using 15n labeled techniques wang et al 2014 2019 hou et al 2017 by labeling 15n it was found that compared with the conventional irrigation 15n leaching was reduced and 61 3 of 15n pre labeled in the 40 50 cm soil layer was promoted to move upward to 0 40 cm layer under apri wang et al 2014 drip fertigation is convenient in supplying water and fertilizer directly to the root zone with high efficiency previous studies have shown that both drip fertigation and adi have beneficial effects on improving crop dry mass accumulation yield n uptake and wue and nue e g rajput and patel 2006 bhat et al 2007 zhang et al 2011 liang et al 2013 topak et al 2016 wang et al 2017 sezen et al 2019 however the impact of combined application of adi and n fertigation on crop yield wue n uptake and the fate of fertilizer n remain unclear it is hypothesized that adi with n fertilization can improve the growth wue and nue of tomato plants in the present study the n isotopic technique was used to quantify the n migration within the soil profile and utilization by tomato under alternate partial root zone drip irrigation the outcome of the present study would provide a theoretical basis for efficient utilization of water and n fertilizer under alternate partial root zone drip irrigation and as well as theoretical guidance for the agricultural practices to save both water and nitrogen fertilizer 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the experiment was conducted in a greenhouse located at xuji village 116 46 e 33 58 n duji district huaibei city china from february to june 2017 this site has typical warm temperate humid climate with annual average rainfall of 830 mm and annual average relative humidity of 71 the annual average air temperature is 14 4 c with an annual average frost free period of 202 days and 2316 sunshine hours the soil was sandy loam and the basic physical and chemical properties for the 0 20 cm soil layer were shown in table 1 2 2 experimental treatments the experiment was performed in soil columns that were pre buried in the experimental field the soil column was made following the method described in our previous studies wang et al 2014 2019 with slight modifications a homemade cylindrical aluminum drum with a height of 110 cm was used instead of the polyethylene film 0 15 mm thick the drum without bottom was buried in the soil to a depth of 100 cm to form the column the soils in the 0 20 cm layer per column were uniformly mixed with different dosage of fertilizers to provide nutrients including phosphorus p2o5 potassium k2o and microelements before backfilling without nitrogen for adi treatment a plastic film separator with a gap of 5 cm 5 cm size cut in the center was buried in the middle of each soil column to the depth of 0 20 cm forming two equal root compartments in the top soil layer the soil columns treated with conventional drip irrigation cdi were not separated by plastic film separators n fertilizer was 15n labeled urea with 15n abundance of 15 21 supplied by shanghai research institute of chemical industry china via simulated fertigation after onset of treatments water was supplied with a 5 l plastic bucket hanging 1 8 m above soil surface and introduced into the root zone through a medical infusion tube with needles on february 28th 2017 uniform 50 day old seedlings of tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill cv zhongyan no 988 were transferred in the center of the soil columns to make sure that the roots of plants were distributed evenly into the two soil compartments the seedlings were irrigated as cdi before the water and nitrogen treatment was initiated to reduce soil evaporation the columns were covered with plastic films after transplanting twenty eight days after transplanting i e on march 28th the plants were subject to different water and nitrogen treatments the experiment included irrigation and n fertilization treatments and the detailed experimental design was shown in table 2 each treatment was repeated four times in addition two for c100 100 treatment or one for the other four treatments additional soil columns for each treatment with a polyvinyl chloride pvc monitoring pipe buried down to 100 cm soil depth was set up to monitor soil water contents wang et al 2014 2019 there were 25 soil columns in total the irrigation amount m in the sufficient water treatment c100 100 was calculated as m sρbphθf q1 q2 where s is the surface area of the soil column diameter of 45 cm pb is the soil bulk density p is the wetting proportion 0 8 h is the depth of wetting layer i e 0 20 cm of the top soil during the seedling stage or 0 40 cm after the flowering stage θf is the field water capacity 26 q1 and q2 are the upper and lower limit of soil water levels respectively the lower and upper limits of soil water levels were set as 65 and 90 of field water capacity respectively when the soil water content dropped to the lower limit water was supplemented to the predefined upper limit of soil water level the irrigation amount for the deficit irrigation treatment equaled to 1 2 m for the cdi treatment the irrigation water was applied through the needle that was set 5 cm away from the plant penetrating through the plastic film for the adi treatment irrigation water was applied only to one compartment by the needle inserted in the center of the compartment and allowed the other compartment to dry the irrigation was then alternated to the previously drying compartment at next irrigation event letting the formerly irrigated compartment to dry the alternation of the irrigation in the two soil compartments was repeated in turn in the treatment with high n supply 8 30 g urea for each column was supplied based on the assumption of providing 240 kg n ha 1 in the field n fertilizers were delivered into the soil by fertigation during the treatment period in each n fertigation event 0 830 g or 0 415 g 15n labeled urea was dissolved in water and drip irrigated into the soil column through the needle for respectively high n or low n fertilizer treatment the interval for n fertigation was 5 10 days depending on the soil water contents in the soil columns there were five alternate wetting drying cycles in the adi treatments before the harvest of plants the dynamics of soil water content was monitored daily with tdr moisture probes trime pico iph tdr imko germany wang et al 2014 2019 to minimize as much as possible the possible positional influence of light and temperature differences the columns were all set in one row 2 m apart from the edge of the greenhouse 15 cm apart from each other the columns for each treatment were randomly arranged in the row the total irrigation amount was 64 1 l for c100 100 treatment and 39 6 l for each column with low irrigation including 15 1 l of water irrigated for each soil column before the initiation of different n fertigation treatments thus the low irrigation treatment reduced the irrigation water amount by 38 2 compared with the c100 100 treatment 2 3 samplings measurements and analyses fruits were harvested successively and timely at maturity on june 25 2017 the leaves stems and final batch of fruits were collected and weighed all the leaves stems and fruits were oven dried at 105 c for 30 min immediately after sampling and then kept at 70 c until constant weight dried plant samples were ground and sieved through a 1 mm sieve for the determination of nutrient and 15n concentration after the harvest of plants the soils in the soil columns were excavated in each 20 cm depth and roots in the 0 60 cm soil layers were collected by using tweezers wang et al 2014 2019 after root collection the soil was thoroughly mixed in each 20 cm layer and sampled the soil water content was determined the soil samples were dried for the analysis of total n and 15n concentrations the root samples were washed thoroughly with tap water and sterile distilled water subsequently the root samples were scanned by a root scanner epson perfection v700 photo epson japan and the root images were analyzed by winrhizo software regent instruments inc quebec canada finally the root samples were oven dried to constant weight the concentrations of total n and 15n in the soil and plant samples were analyzed by mass spectrometry isoprime100 elementar analysensysteme gmbh germany coupled with an element

treatments on dry biomass yield and iwue under cdi the dry biomass of stem leaf vegetative organs and fruit and fresh fruit yield decreased significantly with decrease of water and or nitrogen supplied table 3 adi increased biomass of each organ and increased the dry weight and fresh weight of fruits by 6 1 and 6 4 respectively compared with cdi at the same level of water and nitrogen supply compared to c100 100 a50 100 only decreased fruit dry and fresh weight by 9 1 and 6 2 respectively the iwue in the adi and cdi treatments increased significantly compared with the control c100 100 under the same water level adi had significantly higher iwue compared with cdi in addition reduced n supply decreased iwue significantly under either cdi or adi the highest iwue was found in a50 100 being 57 higher than that of c100 100 table 3 3 2 effects of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on root growth and distribution the root weight and length decreased with increasing soil depth and about 70 of the total root weight and more than 50 of the total root length were distributed in the 0 20 cm soil layer regardless of the treatment fig 1 a and b under cdi decreasing the amount of water and or nitrogen supply significantly decreased the root weight in the 0 20 cm and 40 60 cm soil layers the lowest total root weight was observed in c50 50 which was 19 lower compared with c100 100 fig 1a and c water or nitrogen supply didn t affect root length distribution in 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers significantly among cdi treatments however root length in the 0 20 cm and the total root length under the c50 100 and c50 50 treatments were significantly lower than that of c100 100 fig 1b and d in adi reducing n supply by 50 didn t affect total root weight total root length and their distribution down the soil profile except a decrease in root weight in 40 60 cm under the a50 50 treatment compared with its cdi counterparts adi increased root weight in 20 40 cm and 40 60 cm layers and also root length in 40 60 cm soil layer the total root weight or root length was similar between a50 100 and a50 100 fig 1c and d similarly there was no significant difference in total root weight among the treatments of a50 100 a50 50 and c100 100 however total root length in a50 100 and a50 50 treatments decreased by 6 9 compared with that in the c100 100 treatment fig 1c and d 3 3 effects of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on n and 15n accumulation in plants compared with c100 100 the c50 100 treatment significantly decreased n accumulation in stems and leaves as well as total plant n accumulation but had no significant influence on n accumulation in the roots and fruits table 4 the 15n accumulation in each organ and the whole plant decreased except in root where a 13 6 increment was observed in c50 100 compared with c100 100 treatment table 5 in the treatments with the same irrigation amount the decrease of n supply decreased both n and 15n accumulation in different organs and also in the whole plant c50 100 vs c50 50 tables 4 and 5 however the 15n use efficiency in c50 50 treatment was higher than that in c50 100 treatment but it was lower compared with c100 100 treatment table 5 compared with cdi with the same n levels adi increased n and 15n accumulation and 15n use efficiency in the stems leaves fruits and the whole plant the a50 100 and a50 50 treatments increased n accumulation by 11 5 and 14 7 as well as 15n accumulation by 10 6 and 10 0 respectively compared with c50 100 and c50 50 tables 4 and 5 under the same n level compared with cdi root n and 15n accumulation were significantly decreased in a50 100 but in a50 50 the n accumulation in the roots were higher while 15n accumulation was similar compared with cdi treatment these results indicated that the transfer of fertilizer n from roots to shoots and especially to fruits under adi was promoted under high n supply but was limited under low n input tables 4 and 5 the total n accumulation under a50 100 was not significantly different from that of c100 100 even though the irrigation amount was reduced by 50 in a50 100 after onset of the treatments however the total 15n accumulation and 15n use efficiency decreased by 16 3 in a50 100 compared with that of c100 100 3 4 effects of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on the 15n distribution in various soil layers in the 0 20 cm top surface soil layer the amount of 15n accumulation accounted on average for 74 5 of the total 15n accumulated in the 0 100 cm soil profile this percentage for the treatment of c100 100 decreased to 60 2 and was the lowest among the treatments the amount of 15n accumulation in the 0 20 cm top soil layer was significantly higher under high n supply c100 100 c50 100 and a50 100 than under low n supply c50 50 and a50 50 fig 2 under high n supply the amount of 15n accumulation in the 0 20 cm soil layer under c100 100 was reduced by averaged 49 1 compared with the c50 100 and a50 100 treatments whereas only little difference in 15n accumulation was observed between the latter two treatments there were large differences in 15n accumulation in the 20 40 cm soil layer among treatments fig 2 and the accumulation amounts in c100 100 a50 100 and c50 100 were 35 73 31 65 and 23 35 mg per soil column respectively however the amount of 15n accumulation in the 20 40 cm soil layer in the c50 50 and a50 50 treatments was only 6 95 and 11 50 mg per layer respectively in the 40 60 cm soil layer 15n accumulation in the c100 100 treatment was significantly higher than in other treatments fig 2 the amount of 15n accumulation in the soil layer below 60 cm soil depth in all five treatments was low with no differences among treatments fig 2 3 5 effects of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on the 15n accumulation and recovery and its loss from soil column the 15n accumulation total recovery and loss of 15n per column was significantly higher under high n c100 100 c50 100 and a50 100 than low n supply c50 50 and a50 50 and in the former treatments they were on average 1 36 1 15 and 0 63 times higher than those in the latter treatments table 6 however the 15n loss percentage was high in treatments with low n supply under cdi compared with c100 100 the c50 100 treatment increased 15n accumulation in the soil profile but decreased the recovery amount of 15n thus increasing the loss amount and percentage of 15n from the soil column the highest n loss percentage was found in the c50 50 treatment which was 34 3 irrespective of its lowest loss amount among the three cdi treatments table 6 under the same irrigation and n application treatments adi significantly increased the accumulation and total recovery amount of 15n but significantly decreased the loss amount and loss percentage of 15n when compared with cdi irrespective of the accumulation amount the accumulation percentage in the c100 100 was the lowest among the treatments in addition adi significantly increased the 15n accumulation percentage compared with the relative cdi treatment the 15n accumulation percentage decreased with the reduction of n application amount data not shown however the 15n loss percentage increased significantly with a decrease in n application rate under the same irrigation amount regardless of whether cdi or adi treatments under cdi c50 50 and c100 100 treatments showed the highest and lowest 15n loss percentage respectively table 6 the lowest 15n loss percentage was observed in a50 50 treatments 21 1 among all the treatments 4 discussion 4 1 effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on yield and wue earlier studies have documented that apri including adi can reduce irrigation water consumption and improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue without a significant yield loss and even in some cases the yield of plants increases in comparison with conventional irrigation e g zhang et al 2014 fu et al 2017 giuliani et al 2017 jovanovic and stikic 2018 in accordance with this in the present study the c50 100 and a50 100 treatments decreased the yield by 10 9 and 6 1 whereas increased iwue by 44 17 and 51 63 respectively compared with the c100 100 treatment table 3 in addition the yield and iwue was higher in adi than its cdi counterparts table 3 such effects could be attributed to a wide range of apri specific positive responses in plants in adi repeated alternation of wetting drying cycles in the root systems could increase the synthesis and alter the redistribution of abscisic acid aba increase ph in xylem sap and induce variation in hydraulic pressure which narrow stomatal opening and thereby reduce transpiration loss while photosynthesis is not significantly affected thus leading to increased crop iwue kang and zhang 2004 liu et al 2008 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 in addition adi could decrease the wet soil surface area and thus reduce soil evaporation furthermore adi could increase lateral infiltration of soil water and decrease vertical water percolation leaving more irrigated water in the upper soil layer where plant roots are mainly concentrated in these are more conducive to plant water absorption and utilization thereby resulting in increased iwue pan et al 2002 kang and zhang 2004 the total vegetative growth of tomato plants in a50 100 and a50 50 decreased significantly compared with c100 100 whereas the total root weight was not significantly different among these treatments fig 1 leading to increased root to shoot ratio in a50 100 and a50 50 treatments data not shown previous studies reported that apri can improve root growth and function i e increasing root surface area root length density and root hair development induced by apri wang et al 2014 chen et al 2016 wang et al 2019 and apri could also promote the transfer of assimilates from shoots to roots stimulate the compensatory growth of roots induced by the repeated drying wetting cycles and improve the aeration of irrigated soil see reviews by kang and zhang 2004 in addition to enhanced root growth it was found that the root distribution was also changed down soil profile by apri as shown in fig 1a and b more roots in terms of root weight or root length were distributed in deeper soil layers promotion of root growth and root distribution in deeper soil layers by apri was also found in eggplant zhang et al 2014 and corn wang et al 2014 li et al 2014 this facilitated absorption of water and nutrients from deeper soil layers providing plants with stable environment for water absorption and increased soil volume for uptake of nutrients in addition the root vigor and root hydraulic conductivity that contributes greatly to crop water uptake were noticeably enhanced by apri hu et al 2005 chen et al 2016 and such compensation could be partly attributed to the newly formed roots and also partly to the old roots that undergo some changes when exposed to rewetting again these morphological and physiological adaptations of roots under apri are beneficial for plant absorption of water and nutrients from soil and could ensure plant growth and yield formation under apri even though the irrigation amount and nitrogen supply were reduced substantially li et al 2011 dodd et al 2015 liu et al 2017 4 2 effect of irrigation and nitrogen treatments on n uptake and nue even though the biomass of vegetative organs and fruits in the a50 100 treated plants was lower than in c100 100 sufficiently fertigated plants the n concentration data not shown and n accumulation did not decline in stems leaves fruits and total plants tables 3 and 4 in addition n accumulation in shoots or in total plant in the a50 50 did not show significant differences even though only half amount of n fertilizer was supplied compared with c50 100 treatment in contrast the n content in roots was lower in a50 100 and a50 50 than c100 100 and c50 100 treatments these findings indicated that adi enhanced n uptake by roots and promoted transfer of n from roots to shoots and fruits compared with cdi adi enhanced root vigor and growth and distribution in deeper soil as discussed above which might have promoted n absorption in addition apri could stimulate the soil organic c and n mineralization as compared with conventional irrigation shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2010 sun et al 2013 the drying and wetting cycles of the soil induced by apri stimulated microbial activities and soil respiration rate leading to a flush of mineral n into the soil solution and thus increased plant n accumulation shahnazari et al 2008 wang et al 2010 compared with c100 100 and c50 100 total n absorption did not differ significantly but the 15n absorption was decreased by 16 3 and 41 1 respectively in the treatments of a50 100 and a50 50 tables 4 and 5 indicating that adi increased more absorption of soil sourced n in addition compared with cdi the increment rate in 15n absorption 10 3 in adi tended to be lower than that in total n accumulation 13 1 especially under low n application calculated from tables 4 and 5 as elucidated above these indicated that adi could promote absorption of nitrogen especially from soil sourced nitrogen under low n input which was consistent with the previous findings sun et al 2013 sun et al 2013 found that soil 13c isotope composition δ13c was significantly higher in apri than in conventional irrigation especially under conditions of low n input in addition plant δ15n soil sourced n tended to be higher in apri than in conventional irrigation at each n fertilizer rate and reduced significantly with increasing n fertilization rate based on the notion that soil microbes discriminate 13c during decomposition of soil organic c and leave the soil enriched with 13c balesdent and mariotti 1996 these findings implied that apri stimulated organic c and n mineralization compared with conventional irrigation especially under low n input sun et al 2013 the proportion of 15n accumulated in the topsoil layer 0 20 cm under high water supply was the lowest accounting for 60 2 and the other four treatments with low water supply on average accounted for 78 0 fig 2 these results were consistent with the findings of xing et al 2015 in addition under high n input total 15n accumulation in 0 100 cm soil was lower with high c100 100 than low irrigation c50 100 this is because urea can rapidly be hydrolyzed into ammonium and then ammonium is converted by nitrifying bacteria into nitrate sigurdarson et al 2018 nitrate has a negative charge like soil colloids and is not adsorbed in soil therefore nitrate n in soil migrates together with water the larger the irrigation amount the stronger the nitrate migration in the present study the irrigation treatments had an important impact on n redistribution in the soil adi was more likely to cause more n remaining in the upper layer of soil and reduced n leaching under the same amount of water and n supply 15n contents in both the upper soil layer 0 40 cm and 0 100 cm were significantly higher under adi than cdi and the 15n loss percentage decreased by 25 1 on average in the former compared with the latter table 6 this is because the alternate wetting and drying of the soil under adi could increase the lateral and decrease the vertical migration of soil water thus reducing n leaching in addition cdi keeps high moisture content in the soil surface layer for a long time potentially resulting in anoxic conditions conducive to denitrification thus decreasing nitrate n content in soil han et al 2018 furthermore adi or apri results in lower ammonia volatilization from soil lei et al 2009 han et al 2014 allowing n accumulation in the upper soil layer and thus increasing the chance of n uptake by crop roots wang et al 2014 hou et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the variation in total 15n recovery amount in the plant soil system with different n treatments was almost the same as the changes in 15n accumulation in the soil with an exception in the c100 100 and c50 100 treatments compare with c100 100 c50 100 increased the 15n accumulation in the soil but decreased the total 15n recovery amount table 6 this was associated with promoted plant growth and increased absorption of nitrogen in the high irrigation treatment c100 100 compared with c50 100 treatment table 5 beside plant n uptake and nitrate leaching gaseous n losses including ammonia volatilization and denitrification are also important pathways of n loss from the soil plant system prasad and hochmuth 2016 n losses of 30 38 kg ha 1 through denitrification over the 8 week experiment in the frequently irrigated fields and 0 88 3 52 g ha 1 d 1 through ammonia volatilization in a semi arid rangeland were reported in literature valé et al 2007 xu et al 2010 interestingly compared with c100 100 c50 100 treatment decreased nitrate content in deeper soil layers and left more of n in topsoil fig 2 in addition urea movement down soil profile could be limited in c50 100 moreover plant capacity to absorb n was limited by reduced irrigation tables 4 and 5 these exposed more nitrogen conductive for gaseous n loss leading to increased 15n loss percentage in c50 100 compared with c100 100 treatment table 6 however the highest 15n loss percentage was found in c50 50 treatment although the total amount of n loss was low under low n treatment the proportion of n lost to n applied was relatively high owing to a low n application amount sun et al 2013 reported similar findings in a pot experiment across the two irrigation regimes apri or conventional irrigation with n fertilization rate having no significant effects on total net n loss implying that the n loss percentage could be increased under low fertilizer n application the percentage of 15n loss decreased under apri due to increased plant absorption of fertilizer n as well as reduced nitrate leaching compared with the relevant cdi treatments tables 5 and 6 the reduction in n loss observed in the present study was contradictory to sun et al 2013 whereby apri led to increased net n loss from the soil plant system the difference was probably due to an absence of nitrate leaching in their pot experiment 5 conclusions under the same irrigation and n application amount compared with the cdi treatment adi promoted root growth especially in deeper soil layers adi decreased n leaching while improved 15n accumulation in topsoil soil n mineralization was promoted in adi contributing to enhanced absorption of nitrogen from both soil and n fertilizer adi increased total recovery amount of 15n but significantly reduced the loss amount and loss percentage of fertilizer 15n when compared with cdi under the same nitrogen rate the adi increased yield thus improving iwue high n supply significantly increased 15n accumulation in all organs stems leaves roots and fruits and thus increased total 15n uptake which was beneficial for yield formation and also increased iwue compared with low n supply however high n supply significantly decreased nue and 15n loss percentage under both cdi and adi in summary adi has great potential in saving irrigation water and nitrogen fertilizer increasing wue and nue while maintaining yield declaration of competing interest the authors declare no

10668,a risk based interval stochastic optimization modelling approach is developed for agricultural water allocation in response to the complexity arising from uncertainties and risk in agricultural water management systems the approach comprises conditional value at risk cvar model inexact two stage stochastic programming itsp model with imprecise probabilities ips and random boundary intervals rbis within a general framework the approach can simultaneously balance expected benefits penalties and risks from agricultural water allocation and can address uncertainties of agricultural water supply and demand in the form of probability distributions and intervals with random boundaries as demonstrated in hulan river irrigation area northeast china the objective of the approach is to allocate limited agricultural water resources to make a trade off between various subareas under different risk aversion levels and possible runoff discharges most inputs to the approach are expressed as interval numbers that are generated by statistical simulation based on which various agricultural water allocation schemes are obtained irrigation water performance based on the optimal results are also analyzed results validate the applicability of the approach incorporating multiple uncertainties and risk aversion measures in optimization models and generating agricultural water allocation schemes in the form of interval numbers keywords agricultural water allocation optimization conditional value at risk random boundary intervals multiple uncertainty model performance 1 introduction water scarcity is becoming an urgent global scale issue by virtue of shrinking water supply and deteriorating water quality hampering ecosystem health and socio economic development zhuang et al 2018 it restricts agricultural development where agricultural irrigation consumes approximately 70 of the total freshwater water amount because water resources originally used for agriculture have to be transferred to industrial domestic and ecological activities for increasing production and energy guaranteeing living quality and promoting environmental protection moreover inefficient water utilization patterns aggravate the conflict between water demand and water supply in agricultural water management systems optimization modelling occupies an important place in identifying effective agricultural water allocation schemes karamouz et al 2012 guo et al 2014 tan et al 2017 li et al 2020 in agricultural water management systems decision makers increasingly face challenges to make decisions in the face of uncertain conditions cai and rosegrant 2004 hassanzadeh et al 2016 li et al 2018 ren et al 2019 such as hydrometeorological measurement errors varying socio economic policies and land utilization errors estimating modeling parameters and system structure these lead to the necessity to apply optimization methodologies under uncertainty for agricultural water allocation among the uncertain optimization methodologies inexact two stage stochastic programming itsp has proven to be an effective approach because it is capable of prescribing corrective actions when a random event occurs li et al 2010 this approach can address uncertainties in the form of both interval numbers and distribution functions however the itsp model is risk neutral with less consideration of systematical risks in previous studies using itsp the expected value of costs or net benefits is considered as the only objective without considering risk control and this may result in serious water shortages when the inflow level is low and in an excessive waste when the inflow level is high conditional value at risk cvar is an effective method for risk measurement of random uncertainties and can be used in an optimization model to reflect associated risks recently some studies have been reported to incorporate the cvar model into the itsp framework to manage water resources dai et al 2014 wang et al 2017 which is capable of reflecting and calculating the expected loss in the itsp model incorporating system net benefits and risk helping analyze trade offs between system benefit cost and risk and addressing uncertainties expressed as probability distributions and discrete intervals in agricultural water allocation systems surface water supply is derived from the upstream runoff the spatial and temporal variations of runoff discharge lead to the variations in allocation strategies and consequent economic benefits tan et al 2013 li et al 2019b such variations become more pronounced especially for areas with significant inter annual variations in runoff discharge this will lead to obvious changes of water supply under different levels of runoff discharge therefore it is necessary to allocate agricultural water corresponding to various levels of water supply in order to provide water allocation strategies more effectively however for each level the corresponding water supply may be with uncertainty that is the estimated value of water supply could be an uncertain number because of short sample series different estimation methods and probability distribution curves thus determining the fluctuation values of the water supply for various levels of runoff discharge is significant from a practical viewpoint that can help mitigate natural disasters nevertheless this has not been included in the framework with the integration of cvar model and itsp model for agricultural water allocation besides fluctuating runoff discharges may lead to the variation of occurrence probabilities which are essential components in both the itsp model and the cvar model however conventional itsp model and cvar model ignored such uncertain information due to data inaccuracy and judgment diversity further in agricultural water allocation systems water demand is indispensable and would normally dominate water allocation outputs under the twin impact of natural factor mainly meteorological conditions and social factor such as economic social management and technical conditions water demand tends to have complex uncertainties which can rarely be simplified as crisp numbers even random or interval variables can hardly address such complex uncertainties lu et al 2015 this leads to the dual uncertainty problem of quantifying such a parameter demand random boundary intervals rbis have the ability to solve this problem cao et al 2010 in rbis the upper bound and lower bound which might correlate to each other are random variables that represent the least and most water demands respectively accordingly it is useful to express water demand as rbis in an optimization model so that the probabilistic information of the lower bound and upper bound can be evaluated however limited studies have been reported on incorporating rbis in the cvar based itsp model for agricultural water allocation to reflect dual uncertainties of water demand therefore the primary objective of this study is to propose a citsp iprbi model for agricultural water allocation under multiple uncertainties the citsp iprbi model incorporates itsp cvar model ips and rbis into a general framework the proposed model is capable of handling multiple uncertainties expressed as intervals probability distributions and intervals with random boundaries in which correlations and intersection between lower bound and upper bound can be addressed achieving a balance among expected benefits penalties and system risks by optimally allocating available agricultural water for different subareas under various possible conditions the study entails the following elements 1 generation of interval numbers for water supply under different frequencies using the bootstrap method and thus obtaining ips 2 generation of rbis for water demand based on the joint probability distribution of lower and upper bounds 3 development of the citsp iprbi model for agricultural water allocation with the objective of maximizing system benefits and 4 analysis of results of the optimization model and irrigation water management performance under different frequencies different risk coefficients and confidence levels for providing more decision making plans the applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated by applying it to hulan river irrigation area in northeast china 2 methodology this section contains two parts 1 formulation of the citsp iprbi model 2 solution method based on two boundary approach chance constrained programming ccp and interactive algorithm the general framework of the citsp iprbi model is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 formulation of citsp iprbi model 2 1 1 inexact two stage stochastic programming with imprecise probabilities the itsp model is an effective technique for reflecting trade offs between pre regulated policy and associated penalty due to any infeasible event as well as in dealing with information expressed as probability distributions and intervals the itsp model can be expressed as follows 1a max f c t x h 1 n p h q y h ξ h subject to 1b a x b 1c t ξ h x w ξ h y h h ξ h h 1 2 n 1d x 0 y h 0 where c t is the vector of coefficients in the objective function x is the first stage decision vector constructed before the random variables are observed q y h ξ h is the second stage cost function y h is the second stage adaptive decision vector that depends on the realization of the random variable ξ h is the random variable vector with an occurrence probability p h p h means the degree of likelihood that random event will occur under level h p h 0 and h 1 n p h 1 a is the matrix of coefficients b is the vector of coefficients in the constraints and t ξ h w ξ h and h ξ h are matrices with reasonable dimensions which are functions of random variable ξ h in agricultural water allocation the itsp can help to provide an effective linkage between conflicting economic benefits and the associated penalties attributed to the violation of the predefined policies the violation mainly stems from the randomness in water supply moreover itsp can help to deal with uncertainty with less data such as irrigation area and irrigation target in the conventional itsp model the occurrence probabilities p h of random variables are deterministic in reality p h can hardly be specified with certainty owing to the lack of data the difference in judgment criterion of different levels of random variables e g water supply and the spatial temporal variation xie et al 2013 wang et al 2016 this leads to the necessity of incorporating the concept of ips into the conventional itsp model that is the p h in the model 1 can be expressed as p h the demonstration on why p h can be expressed as p h and how to determine p h can be found in previous references viniotis 1998 yager and kreinovich 1999 walley 2000 2 1 2 random boundary intervals some components in agricultural allocation e g water demand are affected by multifactors such as natural economic social and technical elements leading to high uncertainty rbis with lower and upper bounds being random variables are introduced to address the dual uncertainty of such components a random boundary interval rbi parameter can be expressed as b b which can be obtained by collecting samples of possible values are in interval forms q 1 r 1 q n r n where q i r i is the value of the i th sample the mean vector and covariance matrix of the samples can be calculated as 2a μ 1 n i 1 n q i 1 n i 1 n r i 2b d σ 1 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 2 where σ 1 2 1 n 1 t 1 n q t μ 1 2 σ 2 2 1 n 1 t 1 n r t μ 2 2 and ρ 1 n 1 σ 1 σ 2 t n q t μ 1 r t μ 2 suppose that inputs follow a distribution based on the mean vector and covariance matrix a joint distribution function can be identified for b b and can be expressed as f u v e g two dimensional normal distribution then the probability distribution function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf of b and b can be obtained by calculating the marginal distributions of the joint distribution function f u v specifically supposing α β to be the range of b the pdf and cdf of b can be generated as 3a f u u α β f u v d v 3b f u u f u u d u similarly suppose χ δ is the range of b then the pdf and cdf of b can be generated 4a f v v χ δ f u v d u 4b f v v f v v d v 2 1 3 conditional value at risk model value at risk var is defined as the maximum expected loss at a certain confidence level which can be calculated using cumulative probability distributions of random variables soltani et al 2016 based on var the cvar model which is the expected mean loss not smaller than var is proposed cvar can be defined as rockafellar and uryasev 2002 5 cvar z e z z v a r α z where e denotes the expected value operator z is the stochastic variable α is the confidence level and α 0 1 va r α z is the value at risk at the confidence level α expressed as inf η ℝ f z η α inf η ℝ f z η α with f z representing the cumulative distribution function of the stochastic variable z to facilitate the calculation cvar at confidence level α can be expressed as li et al 2015 6 cva r α z inf η r η 1 1 α e z η as e denotes the expected value operator e z η can be formulated as h 1 n z η p h with z η max 0 z η z η ℝ the cvar model can help to measure the risks in the trade off between system economy and expected loss under different confidence levels in agricultural water allocation 2 1 4 citsp iprbi model by incorporating rbis ips cvar model into the itsp framework the citsp iprbi model is formulated to tackle different uncertainties the right hand of constraint 1b is expressed as rbis while other coefficients are considered intervals the citsp iprbi model can be formulated as 7a max f c t x h 1 n p h q y h ξ h λ η 1 1 α h 1 n p h v h 7b a x b b 7c t ξ h x w ξ h y h h ξ h h 1 2 n 7d v h q y h ξ h η h 1 2 n 7e x 0 y h 0 v h 0 where λ is the risk coefficient that is specified by decision makers based on their risk preferences η is the auxiliary decision variable denoting the value of var at confidence level α and v h is the auxiliary decision variable that is used to compute the value of cvar under the h th level 2 2 solution method the citsp iprbi model is uncertain that cannot be solved directly with current solution techniques the right hand of constraint 7b is described as rbis with lower bound and upper bound being random variables leading to the high degree of uncertainty of the constraint therefore the key to the solution method is to convert constraint 7b into conventional interval constraints the ccp technique zhou et al 2015 li et al 2019a together with two boundary approach can be introduced cao et al 2010 then constraint 7b can be expressed as 8 pr a x b b 1 q eq 8 implies that the probability for constraint 7b is 1 q where q is the violation probability of constraint 8 and it represents the admissible risk of constraint violating as there are two boundaries of an rbi b b with each boundary having stochastic characteristics the two boundary approach can be used 1 when the lower bound of b is considered constraint 8 can be finally converted into the following form 9 a x b b a x b q b u q where b q f u 1 q given the cdf of b i e f u u that can be obtained from eq 3b based on eqs 4a and 4b b u q is a random variable whose cdf is f v u b q v under the violation probability of q 2 when the upper bound of b is considered eq 8 can be finally converted into the following form 10 a x b b a x b l q b q where b q f v 1 q given the cdf of b i e f v v that can be obtained from eq 4b based on eqs 3a and 3b b l q denotes a random variable whose cdf is f u v b q u under the violation probability of q details of the above transformation can be seen in supplementary material based on the above approach the citsp iprbi model with dual uncertainties can be converted into conventional interval programming that is the randomness of the rbis has been addressed and the rbis are converted into the classical interval numbers however the converted model is still uncertain because of itsp to solve this problem the target values i e x in model 7 of the itsp model should be identified first because if x are considered as uncertain input parameters it is difficult to determine whether x or x will correspond to a higher benefit a linear conversion of x should be conducted to balance system benefits and penalties accordingly let x x z δ x where δ x x x and z 0 1 which is an auxiliary decision variable then we use the interactive algorithm which is a solution method for interval parameter linear programming ilp huang 1996 to transform the citsp iprbi model into four deterministic sub models the solution steps can be summarized as follows step 1 formulate the citsp iprbi model step 2 transform the rbis into interval numbers using ccp technique and two boundary approach step 3 transform the citsp iprbi model into two models step 4 transform the target intervals into deterministic expressions by introducing a decision variable z step 5 transform each model with interval numbers in step 3 into two deterministic sub models based on the interactive algorithm step 6 solve the transformed four deterministic sub models under a given q step 7 give different values of q and collect the solutions based on above steps decision variables for the citsp iprbi model can be obtained including the direct decision variables i e x and y h corresponding to agricultural water target and shortage respectively and some auxiliary variables i e η v h and z η is used to measure the threshold of the cvar model at confidence level α v h is used to compute the value of cvar under the h th level and z is used to transform the x into deterministic one 3 citsp iprbi modeling formulation for agricultural water allocation in this section a citsp iprbi model for agricultural water allocation for different subareas is developed to present the model a list of notations is provided in table 1 3 1 objective function the objective function is to achieve the maximum benefit by allocating limited water resources to different subareas considering water shortage risks the objective function can be expressed as 11a max f i 1 i f b i ω i j a i j δ i j κ i j w t i i 1 i h 1 h p h i 1 i f p i ω i j a i j δ i j κ i j w s i h λ η α 1 1 α h 1 h p h v h where i 1 i f b i ω i j a i j δ i j κ i j w t i represents the total benefit of the promised agricultural water allocation rmb i 1 i h 1 h p h i 1 i f p i ω i j a i j δ i j κ i j w s i h represents the loss due to the shortage of agricultural water allocation rmb and λ η α 1 1 α h 1 h p h v h represents the weighted mean excess loss due to agricultural water allocation which can contribute to the fairness of allocation to varying degrees rmb rmb is the chinese monetary unit 1 us is approximately 6 5 rmb 3 2 constraints the objective function is subjected to a set of constraints that can help decision makers identify the relationship between decision variables and optimal water allocation conditions 1 water supply constraint for each subarea the agricultural water allocation amount should be within the scope of water supply of both surface water and groundwater under each flow level in terms of the developed citsp iprbi model for agricultural water allocation the water allocation amount for different subareas under different flow levels can be obtained by w t i w s i h this constraint can be expressed as 11b w t i w s i h t s w i h t g w i i h 2 water demand constraint the water allocation amount together with effective precipitation for each subarea under each flow level should satisfy the minimum water demand to guarantee crop growth in this study the minimum water demand was expressed as rbis this constraint can be expressed as 11c w t i w s i h e p i a i w d min i i h 3 risk constraint the random characteristics existing in agricultural water allocation lead to unbalanced allocation programs thus in order to obtain a stable allocation scheme risk should be avoided this risk constraint corresponds to the risk part in the objective function and can be expressed as 11d v h i 1 i f p i ω i j a i j δ i j κ i j w s i h η α i h 4 water shortage constraint water shortage of each subarea under each flow level should be less than the targeted agricultural water allocation amounts to ensure the effectiveness of pre decision making this constraint can be expressed as 11e w t i w s i h i h 5 non negative constraint the decision variables for agricultural water allocation should not be negative this constraint can be expressed as 11f w t i w s i h 0 v h 0 i h 4 application 4 1 overview of the study area hulan river irrigation area is located in the northwest foot of the lesser hinggan and in the intersection between songnei plain and the flows of the lesser hinggan the whole irrigation area is in the upper reaches of hulan river basin qing an county northeast of china the longitude is from 125 55 to 128 43 e and the latitude is from 45 52 to 48 03 n see fig 2 the irrigation area is in temperate semi arid and semi humid continental monsoon climate with average precipitation and evaporation being 545 mm and 665 mm respectively hulan river irrigation area contains six subareas heping jianye liuhe fengtian laomo and lanhe five rivers supply water for irrigation including hulan river anbang river lalinqing river ougen river and yijimi river among them anbang river lalinqing river ougen river and yijimi river are the branches of hulan river and the trends of the inter annual variations of the five rivers are basically the same the water source of each subarea is listed in table 2 agricultural irrigation is the largest water consumer in the hulan river irrigation area with total irrigation area being about 2 104 ha rice maize and soybean occupy most of the irrigation area hulan river irrigation area suffers from water shortage because of unreasonable agricultural utilization patterns and inadequate management river water is the major water source for hulan river irrigation area groundwater is also used as a supplement for surface water supply therefore it is significant to optimize agricultural water of hulan river irrigation area to alleviate water shortage many rivers supply water for hulan river irrigation area and there is great flow variation of each river between years because the coefficient of variation of each river flow is larger than 0 5 this leads to the necessity to devise agricultural water allocation schemes under various frequencies considering the fluctuations of water supply high uncertainty of water demand as well as changes in socio economic conditions further realizing the risk levels of agricultural water shortage can help decision makers formulate future agricultural water plans thus the developed model is suitable for hulan river irrigation area which is capable of handling water use conflicts among different subareas effectively allocating limited available water considering the balance of benefits and water shortage risks and making the allocation process more objective and realistic by incorporating uncertainty analysis and optimization techniques 4 2 data collection and processing two kinds of data contribute to the developed framework hydrological parameters and socio economic parameters the acquisition of each parameter is given below hydrological parameters include surface water supply groundwater supply and effective precipitation in this study surface water supply under each frequency was expressed as interval numbers to reflect its uncertainty and the frequencies were set as 1 5 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 99 the frequency meant the level of runoff discharge and the values of runoff discharge were larger corresponding to lower frequencies and vice versa the determination of these interval numbers was based on bootstrap method a resampling technique the steps for obtaining these interval numbers are summarized in supplementary material according to the fetching water proportion water supplies for each subarea were obtained as shown in table s2 in this study the occurrence probability for each flow was expressed as an interval number according to the imprecise probability theory see table s1 data for groundwater supply were obtained from local reports and the effective precipitation was calculated by multiplying precipitation by an effective coefficient table 3 socio economic parameters include minimum water demand irrigation target benefit coefficient and penalty coefficient the minimum water demand expressed as rbis was needed to ensure crop growth according to the statistics the lower and upper bounds series were obtained based on these samples the mean vector and covariance matrix can be calculated the two dimensional normal distribution was used to express the joint distribution of the lower and upper bounds of the minimum water demand table 4 based on the joint distribution the marginal distribution of both upper and lower bounds for each subarea can be obtained as shown in fig 3 then the conditional distribution can be calculated given different violation probabilities q in this study q 0 1 q 0 05 and q 0 01 taking laomo subarea as an example the variations of interval values of water demand are illustrated in fig 2 lwd and uwd in fig 4 mean the lower and upper bounds of water demands u 0 1 u 0 05 and u 0 01 mean the interval values corresponding to the upper bound of water demand under violation probabilities of 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 similarity l 0 1 l 0 05 and l 0 01 mean the interval values corresponding to the lower bound of water demand under violation probabilities of 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 the value of the irrigation target equaled the value of crop evapotranspiration etc for this study the fao56 penman monteith method and crop coefficients were used to calculate etc based on the meteorological data of temperature wind speed radiation sunshine duration and humidity because the inter annual variations of effective precipitation and crop etc are indifferent only an interval value of effective precipitation and etc for each subarea was generated rather than a set interval values for various frequencies the benefit and penalty coefficients were associated with market price irrigation area irrigation quota and yield per unit area for different crops these data were obtained from yearbook local reports and references the interval values of these parameters were obtained by confidence interval or a probable error range detailed information is given in table 2 4 3 results and discussion 4 3 1 system benefits results of system benefits were expressed as interval numbers to reflect uncertainties the changing trend of system benefits and the corresponding cvar values which represent the expectation levels of all involved probabilities are illustrated in fig 5 as the cvar model was considered the combinations of different risk coefficients λ and confidence levels α in the cvar model were regarded as different scenarios in this study λ equal to 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 and α equal to 0 8 0 85 0 9 0 95 0 99 were considered without consideration of cvar i e λ 0 the system benefit ranged from 3 57 to 5 66 108 rmb with the average system benefit of 4 61 108 rmb in such a case decision makers would not consider the variability of uncertain recourse benefits on the basis of a risk neutral attitude and the system benefits would be the largest if possible when considering cvar i e risk coefficient 0 λ 1 with confidence level α was fixed at 0 9 the system benefits decreased as the value of risk coefficient increased and as seen from fig 5 the system benefits were sensitive to the variation of risk coefficients the average system benefit ranged from 1 55 108 rmb with λ 1 to 4 19 108 rmb with λ 0 1 when λ 1 decision makers would absolutely consider the variability on the basis of a risk aversive attitude for this study the value of cvar remained almost stable at first then decreased and then remained stable again at a value of 2 9 108 rmb this was attributed to the changing trade off between the expected total system benefit and the cvar criterion when λ was fixed at 0 5 and confidence level α increased the system benefit decreased from 2 34 4 13 108 rmb to 2 12 3 87 108 rmb with the value of cvar increasing from 2 64 2 73 108rmb to 3 55 3 56 108rmb the confidence level reflected the risk aversive attitude of decision makers higher confidence levels indicated less risk acceptability and an inclination to account for less possible benefit losses the small jumps in losses beyond 95 confidence level underscored the magnitudes of losses that can be expected to occur at lower probabilities these changing trends coincided with the results of previous studies applying cvar for water resources allocation li et al 2015 soltani et al 2016 4 3 2 agricultural water allocation amounts by solving the citsp iprbi model the optimal water shortages of each subarea under combinations of different violation probabilities risk coefficients and confidence levels were obtained optimal agricultural water allocation amounts could be obtained by the difference between agricultural water target and water shortage taking λ 0 5 and α 0 9 as an example the changing trends of total agricultural water shortage and water allocation for hulan river irrigation area are illustrated in fig 6 obviously agricultural water allocation amounts decreased while agricultural water shortages increased as probabilities increased higher probabilities indicated lower runoff discharges that is smaller water supplies the changing trends for both water allocation and water shortage were dramatic for different probabilities indicating that different flow levels had an obvious effect on the allocation scheme this revealed that for the study area with significant variations of inflows studying the dynamic changes of runoff discharges for each possible situation with uncertainties being considered simultaneously was necessary and important and this was one of the advantages of the developed model for each subarea agricultural water allocations under different frequencies are shown in fig 7 among the six subareas water allocations for heping and fengtian subareas were much higher than for other subareas it can be observed from the figure that for jianye liuhe and fengtian subareas the upper and lower bounds for agricultural water allocation amounts were almost the same especially for higher probabilities this indicated that the citsp iprbi model tended to allocate water for areas with smaller water demand for a higher system benefit such results would increase the irrigation guarantee rate from the whole system consideration generally for each subarea water allocation amounts under lower frequencies were larger than those under higher frequencies which was consistent with runoff discharges however it can also be found that the differences of water allocation for each subarea under various frequencies were less significant than the differences of inflows owing to the fetching proportions of river water under different probabilities for example for lanhe subarea the fetching proportions from lalinqing river under frequencies from 1 to 99 ranged from 2 96 to 39 41 fig 8 shows how water shortages or allocation amounts would change under different risk coefficients results under frequencies of 25 50 75 and 95 were analyzed the results under 25 frequency were the average values of the results under 20 and 30 for each frequency the changing trends were the same i e higher risk coefficients corresponded to lower water shortages higher risk coefficients indicated less risks leading to lower water shortages as expected water shortages under higher frequencies were larger with water shortage amounts under 25 50 75 and 95 when λ 0 5 being 3866 4676 104 m3 4707 5494 104 m3 5751 6748 104 m3 and 6997 8293 104 m3 respectively 4 3 3 results under different violation probabilities two conditions for rbis should be considered when solving the citsp iprbi model i e the upper bound and the lower bound of the minimum water demand expressed as rbis were considered respectively the degree of satisfaction of the water demand usually draws attention of decision makers therefore the changes of the ratio of water allocation and minimum water demand considering the two conditions of rbis under different violation probabilities are shown in fig s2 in supplemental material it is clear that when the lower bound was considered the gap between upper and lower values of the ratio for all subareas was smaller than that when the upper bound of water demand was considered such results are attributed to the determination of boundaries of rbis as seen from fig 4 when the lower bound of water demand was considered the interval numbers corresponding to b p b u p were adopted when the upper bound of water demand was considered the interval numbers corresponding to b l p b p were adopted in this study b is equivalent to w d min i taking laomo subarea as an example when the lower bound was considered the values of water demand were w d min 5 1 0 9 w d min 5 u 1 0 9 i e 2100 3410 104 m3 under violation probability of 0 1 were w d min 5 1 0 95 w d min 5 u 1 0 95 i e 2170 3590 104 m3 under violation probability of 0 05 and were w d min 5 1 0 99 w d min 5 u 1 0 99 i e 2300 3840 104 m3 under violation probability of 0 01 similarly when the upper bound was considered different values of water demand were obtained according to the cdf shown in fig 4 for water demand when considering the lower bound the width of intervals under any violation probability was larger than that when considering the upper bound leading to the ratio of water allocation and water demand was smaller when the lower bound of water demand was considered because the water demand was in the denominator to tackle water demands that were expressed as rbis the ccp technique was introduced in any case an increased violation probability q implied an increased risk of violating the water demand constraint more detailed analysis under different violation probabilities can be seen in supplemental information 4 3 4 model performance in order to provide relevant feedback to agricultural water allocation considering different uncertainties and risks and thus help to take corrective actions to maximize the benefits of the irrigation project elshaikh et al 2018 this section evaluated the performance of agricultural water allocation based optimization results irrigation efficiency adequacy and equity indicators were chosen to evaluate the model performance specifically irrigation efficiency indicator could be obtained by calculating the ratio of crop water allocation and water supplies both surface water and groundwater fan et al 2018 adequacy indicator represents the ability of the irrigation system to deliver the required irrigation water and it was the ratio of the water allocation to the required irrigation water for an area over a period elnmer et al 2018 equity indicator expresses the spatial uniformity and fairness of the irrigation system in delivering the required irrigation water and gini coefficient was used to express equity of agricultural water allocation gorantiwar and smout 2005 for the whole irrigation area the changing trends of these three indicators were remarkable under different frequencies see fig 9 in general the changing trend of irrigation efficiency was stable and the corresponding performance was good except extreme wet and dry conditions the results indicated that the ratio of water allocation and water supply remained stable with high irrigation efficiency but the efficiency declined under extreme conditions although the irrigation efficiency for the whole irrigation area was high the adequacy of the irrigation area was not fair even poor for most water supply conditions and the adequacy dropped rapidly as water supply reduced indicating a quite severe water shortage problem for hulan river irrigation area the water allocation equity among different subareas of hulan river irrigation area presented a fair condition as a whole but water shortage tended to undermine the harmonious of water resources allocation especially in extreme dry conditions the irrigation water performance change clearly among different subareas of hulan river irrigation area specifically taking 50 of frequency of water supply as an example the irrigation efficiency performance of heping subarea was the highest while of fengtian subarea was the lowest with the difference was 0 142 the irrigation efficiency performance of jianye and fengtian subareas were fair and of other subareas were good however the adequacy performance for fengtian subarea was good while for other subareas the performances were poor it shows that there is a poor consistency of the performance of irrigation efficiency and adequacy besides we also calculated the water depleted fraction indicator which expressed the ratio of the crop evapotranspiration to the total water inflow sum of surface water and groundwater in addition to precipitation elnmer et al 2018 to monitor the groundwater storage results show that the groundwater storage of fengtian subarea was considered stable with the value of water depleted fraction indicator was 0 61 while for other subareas the extra amount of irrigation water would drained to the surface and groundwater drains the values of water depleted fraction indicator were approximately 0 7 results also show that water supply was the main driven factor for irrigation water performance while the performance impact of risk levels on irrigation water was very low 4 4 discussion one of the aspects that represented the framework performance was that the complicated randomness of water supply and water demand were quantified specifically for water supply interval numbers of water supply under various frequencies i e 1 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 99 and the corresponding interval occurrence probabilities were quantified using the bootstrap method and the imprecise probability method respectively both of which were integrated in the itsp model framework the results provide decision makers more specific fluctuation ranges of agricultural water allocation schemes considering as much water supply levels as possible i e agricultural water allocation ranges under 13 frequencies see figs 6 and 7 rather than schemes under selected qualitative levels mainly high middle and low flow levels in the conventional itsp model fu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 such a quantification can help plan agricultural water allocation schemes more precisely this was especially suitable for regions with obviously inter annual variation of water supply also it can help mitigate natural disasters for example drought in water deficient areas because agricultural water allocation schemes under extreme conditions are obtained for this study water shortages under drought condition p 95 reached up to 148 179 million m3 water transfer from liuhe reservoir was needed to alleviate such a situation this should draw the attention of decision makers as the occurrence probability of such an extreme condition reached from 7 to 9 for water demand in agricultural water allocation it is connected with not only meteorological conditions but also economic social and technical conditions hence it was not suitable to denote such an uncertain parameter as conventional interval numbers because 1 sometimes the gap between upper and lower bounds is too large which will lead to non effective lower robustness of results 2 sometimes investigation may be taken among managers and experts to gain more information of water demand based on local population and economic development level each of the interviewees may give a range of water demand then the samples for lower and upper bounds of possible water demand can be obtained and thus the corresponding probability density functions can be generated situations often arise that some samples for the lower bound of water demand are larger than some samples for the upper bound of water demand see fig s3 which results in the intersection between lower and upper bounds these were the reasons why rbis were introduced in the itsp model to quantify the dual uncertainty of water demand in agricultural water allocation that is both lower and upper bounds of water demand were regarded as random numbers introduction of rbis into the itsp model provided results of dual range compared with the conventional itsp model under the same baseline which provided more accurate decision options because the conventional itsp model simplifies the process of converting rbis into conventional ones making the results of conventional itsp be within the range of results of the citsp iprbi model considering the risks for agricultural water allocation with the incorporation of cvar model was another aspect that assessed the framework performance in this study the system benefit of the citsp iprbi model was from 306 532 million rmb and water shortage was 66 29 74 55 million m3 when the risk coefficient equaled 0 1 and the benefit would be even lower when the values of risk coefficient were larger while the system benefit of conventional itsp model i e regardless of risk coefficient was 357 565 million rmb and water shortage was 87 23 95 49 million m3 this implied that the incorporation of cvar model might lower system benefit by delivering less water in order to reduce risk of water shortage while the conventional itsp model tended to deliver more water to various uses with higher net benefits resulting in a higher risk of water shortage with cvar the citsp iprbi model helped generate an impartial agricultural water allocation scheme based on economic loss control in addition to address the dual uncertainty of water demand which was expressed as rbis the ccp technique with different violation probabilities was introduced this could reflect risks from another angle for example larger violation probabilities corresponded to lower water demand and thus led to less water allocation this indicated lower risks to access water supply but meanwhile lower economic benefit was obtained on the contrary smaller violation probabilities indicated higher risks to access water supply and also came with higher economic benefit hence acute insights of decision makers for agricultural water allocation were required to achieve water allocation equality between resources acquisition and economic benefits based on actual conditions sensitivity analysis was conducted to reflect the effect of different risk coefficients and confidence levels of the cvar model there were in total 150 scenarios and this study took typical scenarios to demonstrate the changing trends of agricultural water allocation schemes results indicated that the increase in the value of risk coefficient increased the relative importance of risk related terms and thus led to risk aversion policies and the reliability of the system was enhanced as the risk coefficient increased decision makers would balance the expected benefits of the system and risk values caused by water shortages through changes of the coefficients of risk levels further in order to reduce the risk of water resources management systems decision makers would modify their development plans according to the allocation targets irrigation water performance was analyzed by indicators of irrigation efficiency adequacy equity and water depleted fraction based on optimal results of the citsp iprbi model this analysis could help decision makers realize how the optimal results performed under uncertainty especially under changing water supplies so that the corresponding countermeasures could be proposed for example decision makers should pay more attention on extreme wet dry conditions because both irrigation efficiency and water resources allocation equity had mutations and decisions varied with different subareas for the significant spatial differences of irrigation water performance the aim of this study was to develop a portable model framework that could reflect multiple uncertainties of agricultural water allocation compared with existing approaches the citsp iprbi model can simultaneously reflect interval uncertainty of water supply under each selected frequency dual uncertainty of water demand as well as possible risk levels of water allocation in one model framework this is beneficial for the decision making process of agricultural water allocation as realistic as possible by generating more alternative schemes and helping balance trade offs of system benefits and water shortage risks however the generation of agricultural water allocation schemes that were close to actual levels might be accompanied by a mass of input data and might require subjective judgment to determine input parameters for example the acquisition of uncertainty ranges of imprecise probability and water demand these led to the computation of citsp iprbi model more complex and time consuming which was a limitation of the citsp iprbi model in addition this study assumed that the lower and upper bounds of water demand obey two dimensional normal distribution function because it has a mathematical basis and handy calculation using other joint distribution functions to describe the boundary of water demand might make results more accurate but would increase difficulty in solution and calculated quantity the citsp iprbi model provided the basic objectives and constraints in addressing agricultural water allocation issues the concrete expressions of the model can be perfected in specific conditions of the command area without changing the model structure the constraints in the citsp iprbi model contained water supply water demand water shortage and water allocation risk these constraints were bottommost for agricultural water allocation and also they were linear in reality the nonlinearity might exist addressing the nonlinearity of the citsp iprbi model might increase its flexibility but also made the computation more complicated all these would need an efficient calculation procedure which deserves further study the framework of the citsp iprbi model was portable and was especially applicable to irrigation areas when 1 there are many water supplies and the annual variation of water supplies is obvious 2 there are multiple uncertainties and the main limiting factors water demand and water supply in this study are highly uncertain the framework of the citsp iprbi model could be embedded in a decision support system with user friendly human machine interface which could help make quick and various decisions for agricultural water allocation considering uncertainties and risks this could improve the universalism of the citsp iprbi model 5 conclusion in this study a citsp iprbi modeling approach for agricultural water allocation under multiple uncertainties is proposed the approach incorporates rbis ips cvar model and itsp model into a general framework the proposed approach is advantageous in 1 balancing trade offs between conflicting economic benefits penalties and system risks for agricultural water allocation 2 reflecting multiple uncertainties described as interval values probability distributions as well as random boundary intervals under various possible conditions which can make the allocation process more objective and realistic and 3 gaining in depth insights into the changes of agricultural water allocation schemes under different risk aversion levels and runoff discharge levels considering multiple uncertainties the proposed approach was applied to an agricultural water allocation system in hulan river irrigation area northeast china this approach would also be applicable to other irrigation areas where multiple uncertainties exist a two boundary approach based on ccp technique was used to solve the citsp iprbi model addressing the correlations between lower and upper bounds of rbis many solutions were generated and the results suggested that the proposed framework would be an effective tool for agricultural water management under multiple uncertainties this study was an attempt for agricultural water allocation by the citsp iprbi model however how to handle input data efficiently and develop efficient solution methods would be a significant improved direction for the proposed approach in the future for agricultural water allocation

10668,a risk based interval stochastic optimization modelling approach is developed for agricultural water allocation in response to the complexity arising from uncertainties and risk in agricultural water management systems the approach comprises conditional value at risk cvar model inexact two stage stochastic programming itsp model with imprecise probabilities ips and random boundary intervals rbis within a general framework the approach can simultaneously balance expected benefits penalties and risks from agricultural water allocation and can address uncertainties of agricultural water supply and demand in the form of probability distributions and intervals with random boundaries as demonstrated in hulan river irrigation area northeast china the objective of the approach is to allocate limited agricultural water resources to make a trade off between various subareas under different risk aversion levels and possible runoff discharges most inputs to the approach are expressed as interval numbers that are generated by statistical simulation based on which various agricultural water allocation schemes are obtained irrigation water performance based on the optimal results are also analyzed results validate the applicability of the approach incorporating multiple uncertainties and risk aversion measures in optimization models and generating agricultural water allocation schemes in the form of interval numbers keywords agricultural water allocation optimization conditional value at risk random boundary intervals multiple uncertainty model performance 1 introduction water scarcity is becoming an urgent global scale issue by virtue of shrinking water supply and deteriorating water quality hampering ecosystem health and socio economic development zhuang et al 2018 it restricts agricultural development where agricultural irrigation consumes approximately 70 of the total freshwater water amount because water resources originally used for agriculture have to be transferred to industrial domestic and ecological activities for increasing production and energy guaranteeing living quality and promoting environmental protection moreover inefficient water utilization patterns aggravate the conflict between water demand and water supply in agricultural water management systems optimization modelling occupies an important place in identifying effective agricultural water allocation schemes karamouz et al 2012 guo et al 2014 tan et al 2017 li et al 2020 in agricultural water management systems decision makers increasingly face challenges to make decisions in the face of uncertain conditions cai and rosegrant 2004 hassanzadeh et al 2016 li et al 2018 ren et al 2019 such as hydrometeorological measurement errors varying socio economic policies and land utilization errors estimating modeling parameters and system structure these lead to the necessity to apply optimization methodologies under uncertainty for agricultural water allocation among the uncertain optimization methodologies inexact two stage stochastic programming itsp has proven to be an effective approach because it is capable of prescribing corrective actions when a random event occurs li et al 2010 this approach can address uncertainties in the form of both interval numbers and distribution functions however the itsp model is risk neutral with less consideration of systematical risks in previous studies using itsp the expected value of costs or net benefits is considered as the only objective without considering risk control and this may result in serious water shortages when the inflow level is low and in an excessive waste when the inflow level is high conditional value at risk cvar is an effective method for risk measurement of random uncertainties and can be used in an optimization model to reflect associated risks recently some studies have been reported to incorporate the cvar model into the itsp framework to manage water resources dai et al 2014 wang et al 2017 which is capable of reflecting and calculating the expected loss in the itsp model incorporating system net benefits and risk helping analyze trade offs between system benefit cost and risk and addressing uncertainties expressed as probability distributions and discrete intervals in agricultural water allocation systems surface water supply is derived from the upstream runoff the spatial and temporal variations of runoff discharge lead to the variations in allocation strategies and consequent economic benefits tan et al 2013 li et al 2019b such variations become more pronounced especially for areas with significant inter annual variations in runoff discharge this will lead to obvious changes of water supply under different levels of runoff discharge therefore it is necessary to allocate agricultural water corresponding to various levels of water supply in order to provide water allocation strategies more effectively however for each level the corresponding water supply may be with uncertainty that is the estimated value of water supply could be an uncertain number because of short sample series different estimation methods and probability distribution curves thus determining the fluctuation values of the water supply for various levels of runoff discharge is significant from a practical viewpoint that can help mitigate natural disasters nevertheless this has not been included in the framework with the integration of cvar model and itsp model for agricultural water allocation besides fluctuating runoff discharges may lead to the variation of occurrence probabilities which are essential components in both the itsp model and the cvar model however conventional itsp model and cvar model ignored such uncertain information due to data inaccuracy and judgment diversity further in agricultural water allocation systems water demand is indispensable and would normally dominate water allocation outputs under the twin impact of natural factor mainly meteorological conditions and social factor such as economic social management and technical conditions water demand tends to have complex uncertainties which can rarely be simplified as crisp numbers even random or interval variables can hardly address such complex uncertainties lu et al 2015 this leads to the dual uncertainty problem of quantifying such a parameter demand random boundary intervals rbis have the ability to solve this problem cao et al 2010 in rbis the upper bound and lower bound which might correlate to each other are random variables that represent the least and most water demands respectively accordingly it is useful to express water demand as rbis in an optimization model so that the probabilistic information of the lower bound and upper bound can be evaluated however limited studies have been reported on incorporating rbis in the cvar based itsp model for agricultural water allocation to reflect dual uncertainties of water demand therefore the primary objective of this study is to propose a citsp iprbi model for agricultural water allocation under multiple uncertainties the citsp iprbi model incorporates itsp cvar model ips and rbis into a general framework the proposed model is capable of handling multiple uncertainties expressed as intervals probability distributions and intervals with random boundaries in which correlations and intersection between lower bound and upper bound can be addressed achieving a balance among expected benefits penalties and system risks by optimally allocating available agricultural water for different subareas under various possible conditions the study entails the following elements 1 generation of interval numbers for water supply under different frequencies using the bootstrap method and thus obtaining ips 2 generation of rbis for water demand based on the joint probability distribution of lower and upper bounds 3 development of the citsp iprbi model for agricultural water allocation with the objective of maximizing system benefits and 4 analysis of results of the optimization model and irrigation water management performance under different frequencies different risk coefficients and confidence levels for providing more decision making plans the applicability of the proposed approach is evaluated by applying it to hulan river irrigation area in northeast china 2 methodology this section contains two parts 1 formulation of the citsp iprbi model 2 solution method based on two boundary approach chance constrained programming ccp and interactive algorithm the general framework of the citsp iprbi model is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 formulation of citsp iprbi model 2 1 1 inexact two stage stochastic programming with imprecise probabilities the itsp model is an effective technique for reflecting trade offs between pre regulated policy and associated penalty due to any infeasible event as well as in dealing with information expressed as probability distributions and intervals the itsp model can be expressed as follows 1a max f c t x h 1 n p h q y h ξ h subject to 1b a x b 1c t ξ h x w ξ h y h h ξ h h 1 2 n 1d x 0 y h 0 where c t is the vector of coefficients in the objective function x is the first stage decision vector constructed before the random variables are observed q y h ξ h is the second stage cost function y h is the second stage adaptive decision vector that depends on the realization of the random variable ξ h is the random variable vector with an occurrence probability p h p h means the degree of likelihood that random event will occur under level h p h 0 and h 1 n p h 1 a is the matrix of coefficients b is the vector of coefficients in the constraints and t ξ h w ξ h and h ξ h are matrices with reasonable dimensions which are functions of random variable ξ h in agricultural water allocation the itsp can help to provide an effective linkage between conflicting economic benefits and the associated penalties attributed to the violation of the predefined policies the violation mainly stems from the randomness in water supply moreover itsp can help to deal with uncertainty with less data such as irrigation area and irrigation target in the conventional itsp model the occurrence probabilities p h of random variables are deterministic in reality p h can hardly be specified with certainty owing to the lack of data the difference in judgment criterion of different levels of random variables e g water supply and the spatial temporal variation xie et al 2013 wang et al 2016 this leads to the necessity of incorporating the concept of ips into the conventional itsp model that is the p h in the model 1 can be expressed as p h the demonstration on why p h can be expressed as p h and how to determine p h can be found in previous references viniotis 1998 yager and kreinovich 1999 walley 2000 2 1 2 random boundary intervals some components in agricultural allocation e g water demand are affected by multifactors such as natural economic social and technical elements leading to high uncertainty rbis with lower and upper bounds being random variables are introduced to address the dual uncertainty of such components a random boundary interval rbi parameter can be expressed as b b which can be obtained by collecting samples of possible values are in interval forms q 1 r 1 q n r n where q i r i is the value of the i th sample the mean vector and covariance matrix of the samples can be calculated as 2a μ 1 n i 1 n q i 1 n i 1 n r i 2b d σ 1 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 ρ σ 1 σ 2 σ 2 2 where σ 1 2 1 n 1 t 1 n q t μ 1 2 σ 2 2 1 n 1 t 1 n r t μ 2 2 and ρ 1 n 1 σ 1 σ 2 t n q t μ 1 r t μ 2 suppose that inputs follow a distribution based on the mean vector and covariance matrix a joint distribution function can be identified for b b and can be expressed as f u v e g two dimensional normal distribution then the probability distribution function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf of b and b can be obtained by calculating the marginal distributions of the joint distribution function f u v specifically supposing α β to be the range of b the pdf and cdf of b can be generated as 3a f u u α β f u v d v 3b f u u f u u d u similarly suppose χ δ is the range of b then the pdf and cdf of b can be generated 4a f v v χ δ f u v d u 4b f v v f v v d v 2 1 3 conditional value at risk model value at risk var is defined as the maximum expected loss at a certain confidence level which can be calculated using cumulative probability distributions of random variables soltani et al 2016 based on var the cvar model which is the expected mean loss not smaller than var is proposed cvar can be defined as rockafellar and uryasev 2002 5 cvar z e z z v a r α z where e denotes the expected value operator z is the stochastic variable α is the confidence level and α 0 1 va r α z is the value at risk at the confidence level α expressed as inf η ℝ f z η α inf η ℝ f z η α with f z representing the cumulative distribution function of the stochastic variable z to facilitate the calculation cvar at confidence level α can be expressed as li et al 2015 6 cva r α z inf η r η 1 1 α e z η as e denotes the expected value operator e z η can be formulated as h 1 n z η p h with z η max 0 z η z η ℝ the cvar model can help to measure the risks in the trade off between system economy and expected loss under different confidence levels in agricultural water allocation 2 1 4 citsp iprbi model by incorporating rbis ips cvar model into the itsp framework the citsp iprbi model is formulated to tackle different uncertainties the right hand of constraint 1b is expressed as rbis while other coefficients are considered intervals the citsp iprbi model can be formulated as 7a max f c t x h 1 n p h q y h ξ h λ η 1 1 α h 1 n p h v h 7b a x b b 7c t ξ h x w ξ h y h h ξ h h 1 2 n 7d v h q y h ξ h η h 1 2 n 7e x 0 y h 0 v h 0 where λ is the risk coefficient that is specified by decision makers based on their risk preferences η is the auxiliary decision variable denoting the value of var at confidence level α and v h is the auxiliary decision variable that is used to compute the value of cvar under the h th level 2 2 solution method the citsp iprbi model is uncertain that cannot be solved directly with current solution techniques the right hand of constraint 7b is described as rbis with lower bound and upper bound being random variables leading to the high degree of uncertainty of the constraint therefore the key to the solution method is to convert constraint 7b into conventional interval constraints the ccp technique zhou et al 2015 li et al 2019a together with two boundary approach can be introduced cao et al 2010 then constraint 7b can be expressed as 8 pr a x b b 1 q eq 8 implies that the probability for constraint 7b is 1 q where q is the violation probability of constraint 8 and it represents the admissible risk of constraint violating as there are two boundaries of an rbi b b with each boundary having stochastic characteristics the two boundary approach can be used 1 when the lower bound of b is considered constraint 8 can be finally converted into the following form 9 a x b b a x b q b u q where b q f u 1 q given the cdf of b i e f u u that can be obtained from eq 3b based on eqs 4a and 4b b u q is a random variable whose cdf is f v u b q v under the violation probability of q 2 when the upper bound of b is considered eq 8 can be finally converted into the following form 10 a x b b a x b l q b q where b q f v 1 q given the cdf of b i e f v v that can be obtained from eq 4b based on eqs 3a and 3b b l q denotes a random variable whose cdf is f u v b q u under the violation probability of q details of the above transformation can be seen in supplementary material based on the above approach the citsp iprbi model with dual uncertainties can be converted into conventional interval programming that is the randomness of the rbis has been addressed and the rbis are converted into the classical interval numbers however the converted model is still uncertain because of itsp to solve this problem the target values i e x in model 7 of the itsp model should be identified first because if x are considered as uncertain input parameters it is difficult to determine whether x or x will correspond to a higher benefit a linear conversion of x should be conducted to balance system benefits and penalties accordingly let x x z δ x where δ x x x and z 0 1 which is an auxiliary decision variable then we use the interactive algorithm which is a solution method for interval parameter linear programming ilp huang 1996 to transform the citsp iprbi model into four deterministic sub models the solution steps can be summarized as follows step 1 formulate the citsp iprbi model step 2 transform the rbis into interval numbers using ccp technique and two boundary approach step 3 transform the citsp iprbi model into two models step 4 transform the target intervals into deterministic expressions by introducing a decision variable z step 5 transform each model with interval numbers in step 3 into two deterministic sub models based on the interactive algorithm step 6 solve the transformed four deterministic sub models under a given q step 7 give different values of q and collect the solutions based on above steps decision variables for the citsp iprbi model can be obtained including the direct decision variables i e x and y h corresponding to agricultural water target and shortage respectively and some auxiliary variables i e η v h and z η is used to measure the threshold of the cvar model at confidence level α v h is used to compute the value of cvar under the h th level and z is used to transform the x into deterministic one 3 citsp iprbi modeling formulation for agricultural water allocation in this section a citsp iprbi model for agricultural water allocation for different subareas is developed to present the model a list of notations is provided in table 1 3 1 objective function the objective function is to achieve the maximum benefit by allocating limited water resources to different subareas considering water shortage risks the objective function can be expressed as 11a max f i 1 i f b i ω i j a i j δ i j κ i j w t i i 1 i h 1 h p h i 1 i f p i ω i j a i j δ i j κ i j w s i h λ η α 1 1 α h 1 h p h v h where i 1 i f b i ω i j a i j δ i j κ i j w t i represents the total benefit of the promised agricultural water allocation rmb i 1 i h 1 h p h i 1 i f p i ω i j a i j δ i j κ i j w s i h represents the loss due to the shortage of agricultural water allocation rmb and λ η α 1 1 α h 1 h p h v h represents the weighted mean excess loss due to agricultural water allocation which can contribute to the fairness of allocation to varying degrees rmb rmb is the chinese monetary unit 1 us is approximately 6 5 rmb 3 2 constraints the objective function is subjected to a set of constraints that can help decision makers identify the relationship between decision variables and optimal water allocation conditions 1 water supply constraint for each subarea the agricultural water allocation amount should be within the scope of water supply of both surface water and groundwater under each flow level in terms of the developed citsp iprbi model for agricultural water allocation the water allocation amount for different subareas under different flow levels can be obtained by w t i w s i h this constraint can be expressed as 11b w t i w s i h t s w i h t g w i i h 2 water demand constraint the water allocation amount together with effective precipitation for each subarea under each flow level should satisfy the minimum water demand to guarantee crop growth in this study the minimum water demand was expressed as rbis this constraint can be expressed as 11c w t i w s i h e p i a i w d min i i h 3 risk constraint the random characteristics existing in agricultural water allocation lead to unbalanced allocation programs thus in order to obtain a stable allocation scheme risk should be avoided this risk constraint corresponds to the risk part in the objective function and can be expressed as 11d v h i 1 i f p i ω i j a i j δ i j κ i j w s i h η α i h 4 water shortage constraint water shortage of each subarea under each flow level should be less than the targeted agricultural water allocation amounts to ensure the effectiveness of pre decision making this constraint can be expressed as 11e w t i w s i h i h 5 non negative constraint the decision variables for agricultural water allocation should not be negative this constraint can be expressed as 11f w t i w s i h 0 v h 0 i h 4 application 4 1 overview of the study area hulan river irrigation area is located in the northwest foot of the lesser hinggan and in the intersection between songnei plain and the flows of the lesser hinggan the whole irrigation area is in the upper reaches of hulan river basin qing an county northeast of china the longitude is from 125 55 to 128 43 e and the latitude is from 45 52 to 48 03 n see fig 2 the irrigation area is in temperate semi arid and semi humid continental monsoon climate with average precipitation and evaporation being 545 mm and 665 mm respectively hulan river irrigation area contains six subareas heping jianye liuhe fengtian laomo and lanhe five rivers supply water for irrigation including hulan river anbang river lalinqing river ougen river and yijimi river among them anbang river lalinqing river ougen river and yijimi river are the branches of hulan river and the trends of the inter annual variations of the five rivers are basically the same the water source of each subarea is listed in table 2 agricultural irrigation is the largest water consumer in the hulan river irrigation area with total irrigation area being about 2 104 ha rice maize and soybean occupy most of the irrigation area hulan river irrigation area suffers from water shortage because of unreasonable agricultural utilization patterns and inadequate management river water is the major water source for hulan river irrigation area groundwater is also used as a supplement for surface water supply therefore it is significant to optimize agricultural water of hulan river irrigation area to alleviate water shortage many rivers supply water for hulan river irrigation area and there is great flow variation of each river between years because the coefficient of variation of each river flow is larger than 0 5 this leads to the necessity to devise agricultural water allocation schemes under various frequencies considering the fluctuations of water supply high uncertainty of water demand as well as changes in socio economic conditions further realizing the risk levels of agricultural water shortage can help decision makers formulate future agricultural water plans thus the developed model is suitable for hulan river irrigation area which is capable of handling water use conflicts among different subareas effectively allocating limited available water considering the balance of benefits and water shortage risks and making the allocation process more objective and realistic by incorporating uncertainty analysis and optimization techniques 4 2 data collection and processing two kinds of data contribute to the developed framework hydrological parameters and socio economic parameters the acquisition of each parameter is given below hydrological parameters include surface water supply groundwater supply and effective precipitation in this study surface water supply under each frequency was expressed as interval numbers to reflect its uncertainty and the frequencies were set as 1 5 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 99 the frequency meant the level of runoff discharge and the values of runoff discharge were larger corresponding to lower frequencies and vice versa the determination of these interval numbers was based on bootstrap method a resampling technique the steps for obtaining these interval numbers are summarized in supplementary material according to the fetching water proportion water supplies for each subarea were obtained as shown in table s2 in this study the occurrence probability for each flow was expressed as an interval number according to the imprecise probability theory see table s1 data for groundwater supply were obtained from local reports and the effective precipitation was calculated by multiplying precipitation by an effective coefficient table 3 socio economic parameters include minimum water demand irrigation target benefit coefficient and penalty coefficient the minimum water demand expressed as rbis was needed to ensure crop growth according to the statistics the lower and upper bounds series were obtained based on these samples the mean vector and covariance matrix can be calculated the two dimensional normal distribution was used to express the joint distribution of the lower and upper bounds of the minimum water demand table 4 based on the joint distribution the marginal distribution of both upper and lower bounds for each subarea can be obtained as shown in fig 3 then the conditional distribution can be calculated given different violation probabilities q in this study q 0 1 q 0 05 and q 0 01 taking laomo subarea as an example the variations of interval values of water demand are illustrated in fig 2 lwd and uwd in fig 4 mean the lower and upper bounds of water demands u 0 1 u 0 05 and u 0 01 mean the interval values corresponding to the upper bound of water demand under violation probabilities of 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 similarity l 0 1 l 0 05 and l 0 01 mean the interval values corresponding to the lower bound of water demand under violation probabilities of 0 1 0 05 and 0 01 the value of the irrigation target equaled the value of crop evapotranspiration etc for this study the fao56 penman monteith method and crop coefficients were used to calculate etc based on the meteorological data of temperature wind speed radiation sunshine duration and humidity because the inter annual variations of effective precipitation and crop etc are indifferent only an interval value of effective precipitation and etc for each subarea was generated rather than a set interval values for various frequencies the benefit and penalty coefficients were associated with market price irrigation area irrigation quota and yield per unit area for different crops these data were obtained from yearbook local reports and references the interval values of these parameters were obtained by confidence interval or a probable error range detailed information is given in table 2 4 3 results and discussion 4 3 1 system benefits results of system benefits were expressed as interval numbers to reflect uncertainties the changing trend of system benefits and the corresponding cvar values which represent the expectation levels of all involved probabilities are illustrated in fig 5 as the cvar model was considered the combinations of different risk coefficients λ and confidence levels α in the cvar model were regarded as different scenarios in this study λ equal to 0 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 and α equal to 0 8 0 85 0 9 0 95 0 99 were considered without consideration of cvar i e λ 0 the system benefit ranged from 3 57 to 5 66 108 rmb with the average system benefit of 4 61 108 rmb in such a case decision makers would not consider the variability of uncertain recourse benefits on the basis of a risk neutral attitude and the system benefits would be the largest if possible when considering cvar i e risk coefficient 0 λ 1 with confidence level α was fixed at 0 9 the system benefits decreased as the value of risk coefficient increased and as seen from fig 5 the system benefits were sensitive to the variation of risk coefficients the average system benefit ranged from 1 55 108 rmb with λ 1 to 4 19 108 rmb with λ 0 1 when λ 1 decision makers would absolutely consider the variability on the basis of a risk aversive attitude for this study the value of cvar remained almost stable at first then decreased and then remained stable again at a value of 2 9 108 rmb this was attributed to the changing trade off between the expected total system benefit and the cvar criterion when λ was fixed at 0 5 and confidence level α increased the system benefit decreased from 2 34 4 13 108 rmb to 2 12 3 87 108 rmb with the value of cvar increasing from 2 64 2 73 108rmb to 3 55 3 56 108rmb the confidence level reflected the risk aversive attitude of decision makers higher confidence levels indicated less risk acceptability and an inclination to account for less possible benefit losses the small jumps in losses beyond 95 confidence level underscored the magnitudes of losses that can be expected to occur at lower probabilities these changing trends coincided with the results of previous studies applying cvar for water resources allocation li et al 2015 soltani et al 2016 4 3 2 agricultural water allocation amounts by solving the citsp iprbi model the optimal water shortages of each subarea under combinations of different violation probabilities risk coefficients and confidence levels were obtained optimal agricultural water allocation amounts could be obtained by the difference between agricultural water target and water shortage taking λ 0 5 and α 0 9 as an example the changing trends of total agricultural water shortage and water allocation for hulan river irrigation area are illustrated in fig 6 obviously agricultural water allocation amounts decreased while agricultural water shortages increased as probabilities increased higher probabilities indicated lower runoff discharges that is smaller water supplies the changing trends for both water allocation and water shortage were dramatic for different probabilities indicating that different flow levels had an obvious effect on the allocation scheme this revealed that for the study area with significant variations of inflows studying the dynamic changes of runoff discharges for each possible situation with uncertainties being considered simultaneously was necessary and important and this was one of the advantages of the developed model for each subarea agricultural water allocations under different frequencies are shown in fig 7 among the six subareas water allocations for heping and fengtian subareas were much higher than for other subareas it can be observed from the figure that for jianye liuhe and fengtian subareas the upper and lower bounds for agricultural water allocation amounts were almost the same especially for higher probabilities this indicated that the citsp iprbi model tended to allocate water for areas with smaller water demand for a higher system benefit such results would increase the irrigation guarantee rate from the whole system consideration generally for each subarea water allocation amounts under lower frequencies were larger than those under higher frequencies which was consistent with runoff discharges however it can also be found that the differences of water allocation for each subarea under various frequencies were less significant than the differences of inflows owing to the fetching proportions of river water under different probabilities for example for lanhe subarea the fetching proportions from lalinqing river under frequencies from 1 to 99 ranged from 2 96 to 39 41 fig 8 shows how water shortages or allocation amounts would change under different risk coefficients results under frequencies of 25 50 75 and 95 were analyzed the results under 25 frequency were the average values of the results under 20 and 30 for each frequency the changing trends were the same i e higher risk coefficients corresponded to lower water shortages higher risk coefficients indicated less risks leading to lower water shortages as expected water shortages under higher frequencies were larger with water shortage amounts under 25 50 75 and 95 when λ 0 5 being 3866 4676 104 m3 4707 5494 104 m3 5751 6748 104 m3 and 6997 8293 104 m3 respectively 4 3 3 results under different violation probabilities two conditions for rbis should be considered when solving the citsp iprbi model i e the upper bound and the lower bound of the minimum water demand expressed as rbis were considered respectively the degree of satisfaction of the water demand usually draws attention of decision makers therefore the changes of the ratio of water allocation and minimum water demand considering the two conditions of rbis under different violation probabilities are shown in fig s2 in supplemental material it is clear that when the lower bound was considered the gap between upper and lower values of the ratio for all subareas was smaller than that when the upper bound of water demand was considered such results are attributed to the determination of boundaries of rbis as seen from fig 4 when the lower bound of water demand was considered the interval numbers corresponding to b p b u p were adopted when the upper bound of water demand was considered the interval numbers corresponding to b l p b p were adopted in this study b is equivalent to w d min i taking laomo subarea as an example when the lower bound was considered the values of water demand were w d min 5 1 0 9 w d min 5 u 1 0 9 i e 2100 3410 104 m3 under violation probability of 0 1 were w d min 5 1 0 95 w d min 5 u 1 0 95 i e 2170 3590 104 m3 under violation probability of 0 05 and were w d min 5 1 0 99 w d min 5 u 1 0 99 i e 2300 3840 104 m3 under violation probability of 0 01 similarly when the upper bound was considered different values of water demand were obtained according to the cdf shown in fig 4 for water demand when considering the lower bound the width of intervals under any violation probability was larger than that when considering the upper bound leading to the ratio of water allocation and water demand was smaller when the lower bound of water demand was considered because the water demand was in the denominator to tackle water demands that were expressed as rbis the ccp technique was introduced in any case an increased violation probability q implied an increased risk of violating the water demand constraint more detailed analysis under different violation probabilities can be seen in supplemental information 4 3 4 model performance in order to provide relevant feedback to agricultural water allocation considering different uncertainties and risks and thus help to take corrective actions to maximize the benefits of the irrigation project elshaikh et al 2018 this section evaluated the performance of agricultural water allocation based optimization results irrigation efficiency adequacy and equity indicators were chosen to evaluate the model performance specifically irrigation efficiency indicator could be obtained by calculating the ratio of crop water allocation and water supplies both surface water and groundwater fan et al 2018 adequacy indicator represents the ability of the irrigation system to deliver the required irrigation water and it was the ratio of the water allocation to the required irrigation water for an area over a period elnmer et al 2018 equity indicator expresses the spatial uniformity and fairness of the irrigation system in delivering the required irrigation water and gini coefficient was used to express equity of agricultural water allocation gorantiwar and smout 2005 for the whole irrigation area the changing trends of these three indicators were remarkable under different frequencies see fig 9 in general the changing trend of irrigation efficiency was stable and the corresponding performance was good except extreme wet and dry conditions the results indicated that the ratio of water allocation and water supply remained stable with high irrigation efficiency but the efficiency declined under extreme conditions although the irrigation efficiency for the whole irrigation area was high the adequacy of the irrigation area was not fair even poor for most water supply conditions and the adequacy dropped rapidly as water supply reduced indicating a quite severe water shortage problem for hulan river irrigation area the water allocation equity among different subareas of hulan river irrigation area presented a fair condition as a whole but water shortage tended to undermine the harmonious of water resources allocation especially in extreme dry conditions the irrigation water performance change clearly among different subareas of hulan river irrigation area specifically taking 50 of frequency of water supply as an example the irrigation efficiency performance of heping subarea was the highest while of fengtian subarea was the lowest with the difference was 0 142 the irrigation efficiency performance of jianye and fengtian subareas were fair and of other subareas were good however the adequacy performance for fengtian subarea was good while for other subareas the performances were poor it shows that there is a poor consistency of the performance of irrigation efficiency and adequacy besides we also calculated the water depleted fraction indicator which expressed the ratio of the crop evapotranspiration to the total water inflow sum of surface water and groundwater in addition to precipitation elnmer et al 2018 to monitor the groundwater storage results show that the groundwater storage of fengtian subarea was considered stable with the value of water depleted fraction indicator was 0 61 while for other subareas the extra amount of irrigation water would drained to the surface and groundwater drains the values of water depleted fraction indicator were approximately 0 7 results also show that water supply was the main driven factor for irrigation water performance while the performance impact of risk levels on irrigation water was very low 4 4 discussion one of the aspects that represented the framework performance was that the complicated randomness of water supply and water demand were quantified specifically for water supply interval numbers of water supply under various frequencies i e 1 5 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 95 and 99 and the corresponding interval occurrence probabilities were quantified using the bootstrap method and the imprecise probability method respectively both of which were integrated in the itsp model framework the results provide decision makers more specific fluctuation ranges of agricultural water allocation schemes considering as much water supply levels as possible i e agricultural water allocation ranges under 13 frequencies see figs 6 and 7 rather than schemes under selected qualitative levels mainly high middle and low flow levels in the conventional itsp model fu et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 such a quantification can help plan agricultural water allocation schemes more precisely this was especially suitable for regions with obviously inter annual variation of water supply also it can help mitigate natural disasters for example drought in water deficient areas because agricultural water allocation schemes under extreme conditions are obtained for this study water shortages under drought condition p 95 reached up to 148 179 million m3 water transfer from liuhe reservoir was needed to alleviate such a situation this should draw the attention of decision makers as the occurrence probability of such an extreme condition reached from 7 to 9 for water demand in agricultural water allocation it is connected with not only meteorological conditions but also economic social and technical conditions hence it was not suitable to denote such an uncertain parameter as conventional interval numbers because 1 sometimes the gap between upper and lower bounds is too large which will lead to non effective lower robustness of results 2 sometimes investigation may be taken among managers and experts to gain more information of water demand based on local population and economic development level each of the interviewees may give a range of water demand then the samples for lower and upper bounds of possible water demand can be obtained and thus the corresponding probability density functions can be generated situations often arise that some samples for the lower bound of water demand are larger than some samples for the upper bound of water demand see fig s3 which results in the intersection between lower and upper bounds these were the reasons why rbis were introduced in the itsp model to quantify the dual uncertainty of water demand in agricultural water allocation that is both lower and upper bounds of water demand were regarded as random numbers introduction of rbis into the itsp model provided results of dual range compared with the conventional itsp model under the same baseline which provided more accurate decision options because the conventional itsp model simplifies the process of converting rbis into conventional ones making the results of conventional itsp be within the range of results of the citsp iprbi model considering the risks for agricultural water allocation with the incorporation of cvar model was another aspect that assessed the framework performance in this study the system benefit of the citsp iprbi model was from 306 532 million rmb and water shortage was 66 29 74 55 million m3 when the risk coefficient equaled 0 1 and the benefit would be even lower when the values of risk coefficient were larger while the system benefit of conventional itsp model i e regardless of risk coefficient was 357 565 million rmb and water shortage was 87 23 95 49 million m3 this implied that the incorporation of cvar model might lower system benefit by delivering less water in order to reduce risk of water shortage while the conventional itsp model tended to deliver more water to various uses with higher net benefits resulting in a higher risk of water shortage with cvar the citsp iprbi model helped generate an impartial agricultural water allocation scheme based on economic loss control in addition to address the dual uncertainty of water demand which was expressed as rbis the ccp technique with different violation probabilities was introduced this could reflect risks from another angle for example larger violation probabilities corresponded to lower water demand and thus led to less water allocation this indicated lower risks to access water supply but meanwhile lower economic benefit was obtained on the contrary smaller violation probabilities indicated higher risks to access water supply and also came with higher economic benefit hence acute insights of decision makers for agricultural water allocation were required to achieve water allocation equality between resources acquisition and economic benefits based on actual conditions sensitivity analysis was conducted to reflect the effect of different risk coefficients and confidence levels of the cvar model there were in total 150 scenarios and this study took typical scenarios to demonstrate the changing trends of agricultural water allocation schemes results indicated that the increase in the value of risk coefficient increased the relative importance of risk related terms and thus led to risk aversion policies and the reliability of the system was enhanced as the risk coefficient increased decision makers would balance the expected benefits of the system and risk values caused by water shortages through changes of the coefficients of risk levels further in order to reduce the risk of water resources management systems decision makers would modify their development plans according to the allocation targets irrigation water performance was analyzed by indicators of irrigation efficiency adequacy equity and water depleted fraction based on optimal results of the citsp iprbi model this analysis could help decision makers realize how the optimal results performed under uncertainty especially under changing water supplies so that the corresponding countermeasures could be proposed for example decision makers should pay more attention on extreme wet dry conditions because both irrigation efficiency and water resources allocation equity had mutations and decisions varied with different subareas for the significant spatial differences of irrigation water performance the aim of this study was to develop a portable model framework that could reflect multiple uncertainties of agricultural water allocation compared with existing approaches the citsp iprbi model can simultaneously reflect interval uncertainty of water supply under each selected frequency dual uncertainty of water demand as well as possible risk levels of water allocation in one model framework this is beneficial for the decision making process of agricultural water allocation as realistic as possible by generating more alternative schemes and helping balance trade offs of system benefits and water shortage risks however the generation of agricultural water allocation schemes that were close to actual levels might be accompanied by a mass of input data and might require subjective judgment to determine input parameters for example the acquisition of uncertainty ranges of imprecise probability and water demand these led to the computation of citsp iprbi model more complex and time consuming which was a limitation of the citsp iprbi model in addition this study assumed that the lower and upper bounds of water demand obey two dimensional normal distribution function because it has a mathematical basis and handy calculation using other joint distribution functions to describe the boundary of water demand might make results more accurate but would increase difficulty in solution and calculated quantity the citsp iprbi model provided the basic objectives and constraints in addressing agricultural water allocation issues the concrete expressions of the model can be perfected in specific conditions of the command area without changing the model structure the constraints in the citsp iprbi model contained water supply water demand water shortage and water allocation risk these constraints were bottommost for agricultural water allocation and also they were linear in reality the nonlinearity might exist addressing the nonlinearity of the citsp iprbi model might increase its flexibility but also made the computation more complicated all these would need an efficient calculation procedure which deserves further study the framework of the citsp iprbi model was portable and was especially applicable to irrigation areas when 1 there are many water supplies and the annual variation of water supplies is obvious 2 there are multiple uncertainties and the main limiting factors water demand and water supply in this study are highly uncertain the framework of the citsp iprbi model could be embedded in a decision support system with user friendly human machine interface which could help make quick and various decisions for agricultural water allocation considering uncertainties and risks this could improve the universalism of the citsp iprbi model 5 conclusion in this study a citsp iprbi modeling approach for agricultural water allocation under multiple uncertainties is proposed the approach incorporates rbis ips cvar model and itsp model into a general framework the proposed approach is advantageous in 1 balancing trade offs between conflicting economic benefits penalties and system risks for agricultural water allocation 2 reflecting multiple uncertainties described as interval values probability distributions as well as random boundary intervals under various possible conditions which can make the allocation process more objective and realistic and 3 gaining in depth insights into the changes of agricultural water allocation schemes under different risk aversion levels and runoff discharge levels considering multiple uncertainties the proposed approach was applied to an agricultural water allocation system in hulan river irrigation area northeast china this approach would also be applicable to other irrigation areas where multiple uncertainties exist a two boundary approach based on ccp technique was used to solve the citsp iprbi model addressing the correlations between lower and upper bounds of rbis many solutions were generated and the results suggested that the proposed framework would be an effective tool for agricultural water management under multiple uncertainties this study was an attempt for agricultural water allocation by the citsp iprbi model however how to handle input data efficiently and develop efficient solution methods would be a significant improved direction for the proposed approach in the future for agricultural water allocation

10669,agriculture is one of most important economic activities that requires large amounts of water which in addition to changes in climate presents a major impact on the water availability excess of salt and nutrient concentrations build up damages to soil such as reduced drainage and increase in anoxic conditions in the root zone as well as decreasing productivity and usable farm lands the objective of the present study was to evaluate the chemical vulnerability of an aquifer in arid conditions with a high level of extraction through the detection of risk zones and potential subregions of different risks an evaluation of the quality of the groundwater was performed as a reconnaissance prior to more detailed studies in which samples of 30 wells were analyzed to determine physical chemical parameters recorded in situ dissolved chemical species uv vis spectrophotometry and elemental content x ray fluorescence spectrophotometry concentrations of tds as well as ca mg s cl and as determined in the water under analysis exceeded the limit established for water for consumption and irrigation it is suggests that the origin of the elemental composition is mainly due to the mineral composition of the aquifer sediments the wells were classified in three groups located in different zones based on a alkaline earth elements b halogens c dissolved ions water salinity is mainly composed by sulphates and a lesser extent by hydrochloric salts from leaching of evaporites furthermore the highest chemical vulnerability are located from central to north zone where the soils showed crop leaching requirement by above of threshold value for pecan crops one of the major agricultural products of the valley in conclusion both the salinity and the high level of water extraction for agriculture combined with the arid conditions are provoking an increase in contents of some chemical species in soil of crops the immediate consequences are related to a reduction in the agricultural production and therefore a decrease in the productive competitiveness keywords arid zone chemical species spatial distribution groundwater 1 introduction worldwide there are different regions that are

2016 this in turn jeopardizes the agricultural economy of the region as well as food and water security for the region it is important to note that current monitoring programs do not provide a complete spectrum of measurement and analysis of toxic substances that are affecting groundwater quality and agricultural sustainability thus when water conditions are less favorable the major crops suffers from toxicity and a nutrient imbalance chowdhury et al 2016 commonly salinity in addition factors such as high water tables soil type changes in the profile soil compaction soil salinity and soil fertility may restrict root development as a result absorption of nutrients through the roots is reduced lowering growth of the leaves buds and fruits ben salem et al 2014 and overall crop productivity this also requires more irrigation to leach the root zone and this indirectly drives further overexploitation of the groundwater resources because of this studies on the current situation of the aquifers based on the availability of the resource are needed due to the environmental conditions and overexploitation the assessment of chemical vulnerability including emerging contaminants have to be determinted as it has been carried out in zones with intense agriculture practices such as central valley ca usa belitz dubrovsky et al 2003 harter rollins et al 2008 belitz jurgens et al 2016 in that region it has implemented the sustainable groundwater management act that have identified in new laws and regulations that these vulnerabilities are unacceptable and are termed undesirable results from overexploitation of the groundwater resources and conjunctive use of surface and ground water sgma 2014 through the detection of risk areas therefore the evaluation of chemical vulnerability is a useful tool to governmental and private agencies which must consider prioritizing groundwater resource and to implement sustainable management programs to provide not only drinking water but also water of good quality for food production and maintain the health of land and water resources the objective of the present reconnaissance study was to make a preliminary evaluation of the chemical vulnerability of an aquifer under arid conditions and to explore detection of risk and related risk areas with a high rate of consumption and extraction as well as additional potential contaminants without a well defined program of long term management and related limits to uses these deleterious effects can result in further overexploitation and degradation of the groundwater quality plus secondary adverse effects such as groundwater storage depletion and related land subsidence and capture of streamflow 2 materials and methods to identify and delineate potential vulnerability and risk zones based on groundwater availability in an agricultural area the following aspects were evaluated a evaluation of the quality of the groundwater including diverse chemical species and b identification of risk areas based on statistical methods such as pca and cluster analysis combined with risk indicators such as sar and clr to help frame the potential risks to agriculture from various poor quality waters from multiple sources 2 1 study site the aquifer of jimenez camargo is located in the extreme southeast of the state of chihuahua and measures 9947 7 km2 it is located between the coordinates 27 08 north and 104 55 west at a height of 1380 m above sea level inafed 2017 the climate is semiarid with a mean annual temperature of 18 7 c and an average annual precipitation of 380 mm conagua 2008 the study site is located in hydrological region 24 from the rio bravo conchos basin to the rio florido basin the region is influenced by three sub basins rio florido camargo rh24ma rio florido jimenez rh24mb and rio parral rh24md fig 1 the aquifer is almost completely composed of alluvial material located in the lower parts of the valley from the north to the southeast the aquifer jimenez camargo is an unconfined aquifer with some regions semiconfined the surface is composed of sand and gravel and can even contain accumulated clay and or carbonate sulphate minerals therefore its nature generates a high content of some chemical species hernández 2012 sedimentary rocks are present in the aquifer clustered from the north to the southeast as well as limestones shales and sandstones igneous rocks of the following types also outcrop in different areas rhyolites volcanic rocks and basalts conagua 2018 the soil of the aquifer is mainly composed of xerosol which is characteristic of dry areas with a clear and thin surface with highly variable amounts of organic matter depending on the type of texture under this layer there is an accumulation of clay minerals and or carbonates or sulfates at a certain depth there are spots lime agglomerations and gypsum or caliche crystals conagua 2018 in the zone there are mining districts of pb fe zn mn cu and ba servicio geológico mexicano 2007 inafed 2017 inegi 2017 fig 1 shows the location of the study area as well as the locations of the wells sampled 2 2 evaluation of the water quality 2 2 1 water sampling the jimenez camargo aquifer is placed in the municipalities of allende coronado camargo jiménez lópez matamoros and santa barbara in this aquifer there is a total of 1326 wells where 303 of these are inactive the water uses of them are for agriculture 829 urban consumption 105 livestock 54 unidentified 22 diverse 12 and industry 1 in the present study and according to the criteria established to an aquifer scale proportion belitz jurgens et al 2010 a subset of wells was evaluated for this initial reconnaissance in the area of the most intensive agriculture production this area have 208 wells for irrigation and it is located in the municipality of jiménez fig 1 thus water samples from 30 wells used for irrigating pecan producing orchards were analyzed for water quality and water chemistry samples were taken in sterile polypropylene containers of 1 l nom 014 ssa1 1993 1993 that were placed on ice 4 c 1 c until further analysis depth of sampled wells are between 130 150 m sample locations were determined randomly and they were located using a global positioning system gps 2 2 2 measurement techniques parameters measured in situ were temperature t ph turbidity tb electric conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds using a multi parametric equipment hanna hl98130 and a portable turbidimeter hanna hi 93703 to determine anions such as sulfates nitrates nitrites and chlorides a spectrophotometer was used uv vis hach d3900 the determination of the element composition was done with an x ray fluorescent spectrophotometer txrf for this the material used in the equipment was prepared and a chemical process was performed to isolate specific elements prior to the analysis the sapphire disc used in the elemental deposition process was set up using the protocol described in the manual of the equipment thus sapphire discs were immersed in a 10 hno3 solution sigma aldrich at 40 c for 30 min after these were washed with distilled water and acetone sigma aldrich to be dried using fresh air an aliquot of water sample of 995 μl was spiked with 5 μl of 1000 ppm ga standard sigma aldrich and stirring until a homogeneous mixture was achieved from this solution 10 μl aliquot was taken to be deposited in the sapphire discs and put under dryness at 80 c measurement of the inorganic chemical elements na mg s cl fe br as pb sr and zn was performed with a bruker s2 picofox spectrophotometer usa 2 2 3 statistical analysis to determine the origin of obtained variables a pearson correlation matrix was calculated using the procedure corr in package sas 2000 with p 0 05 and p 0 01 then to reduce the number of variables a principal component analysis pca was performed using the procedure princomp sas 2000 with significant values of p 0 05 2 2 4 chemical vulnerability and spatial distribution maps to estimate parameter values for areas with no information on the parameters that were quantified in situ as well as for anions cations and metals present in the water kriging interpolation was used to generate regional estimates as maps of chemical attributes this method uses existing values surrounding the area that is to be estimated raster layers were generated using the program arcgis 10 3 environmental systems research institute 2014 with information linked to the database of the variables analyzed in the present study the interpolations were conducted using the geostatistical analyst extension water irrigation may contain excess of salt and nutrient as well as toxic elements leading to build up damages in soil of crops this has been documented to limit productivity and the overall amount of usable farmland with increased salinity in the arkansas river valley of colorado after decades of agriculture morway and gates 2012 the chemical vulnerabilities related to salinity in water for irrigation were obtained using the sodium absorption ratio sar and the crop leaching requirements clr deflocculating of clays sar is an indicator of damages such as a reduced drainage and an increase in anoxic conditions in the root zone of crops due to soil acts as a water reservoir the clr in the root zone must be known in order to determine how much irrigation water is needed sar and clr were obtained by eqs 1 minhas qadir et al 2019 and 2 rhoades chanduvi et al 1999 laloy javaux et al 2011 respectively 1 sar na ca2 mg2 2 where na ca2 mg2 are the na ca and mg concentrations meq l respectively 2 clr ecw 5 ece ecw where ecw is electrical conductivity of irrigation water and ece is electrical conductivity in soil clr can be multiplied by 100 to obtain the fraction in percent 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the water quality 3 1 1 chemical characterization the samples collected were compared to the mexican regulation nom 127 ssa1 1994 1994 conagua 2009 and the federal law on water rights as well as to the international regulation fao 1976 usepa 1996 oms 2010 in table 1 the results from the water quality analysis are shown values of ph were between 7 06 and 8 59 from neutral to slightly basic ec showed values up to 6 25 ds m 1 whereas tb of 22 2 ntu in addition tds oscillated between 386 and 3115 mg l 1 finally t ranged from 14 to 36 c with 15 wells above 25 c furthermore for anions nitrate values were found from 0 50 to 32 5 mg l 1 whereas nitrites presented concentrations between 0 5 and 7 mg l 1 on the other hand chlorides went up to 1760 and sulfates up to 2175 mg l 1 element composition for elements with concentrations over 1 mgl 1 were observed in the following order of abundance s ca na cl mg k sr whereas the order of abundance for elements with concentrations lower than 1 mgl 1 was p br zn as fe cu pb 3 1 2 statistical analysis the multivariate principal component analysis pca is a factor analysis which statistically is useful for reducing the number of variables to a few components that represent the majority of the variation li yang et al 2017 thus pca is useful in reconnaissance studies because it can help to identify groups of attributes and groups of samples that have similar composition and variability guan hutson et al 2013 ravikumar and somashekar 2017 in the present study the first six components explained 81 7 of the total variation in the wells table 2 the first component pc1 represented 26 45 of the total variation it can be observed that significant variables p 0 05 were mg s sr k cu and ca principal component 2 pc2 represented 19 18 of the variation where significant values were tb and nitrates cl zn and br pc3 was responsible for 13 28 of the variation with t na and nitrites pc4 represented 9 73 with high representation of chlorides tds ec and as pc5 explained 6 95 with sulphates fe and pb finally pc6 explained 6 12 with variables such as ph and k the cluster analysis identified samples with the same location and geological origin that in turn may indicate similar sources chemistry and potential contaminants mohapatra vijay et al 2011 three groupings were identified with an r2 value of 0 70 fig 2 the first group with three wells presents a tds of 916 mg l 1 and a tb of 11 2 ntu indicating moderate to high presence of salts the second group with 18 wells presents high levels of ca 164 mg l 1 mg 16 mg l 1 and k 7 1 mg l 1 whereas group 3 with five wells presents the highest amount of tds with 2073 mg l 1 a t of 30 9 c and cl of 705 mg l 1 for which these last wells are very saline 3 2 spatial distribution of chemical species the results on the spatial distribution of the dissolved ionic species and elements present in the water are shown in figs 3 and 4 and 5 sulphates showed a high concentrations in well defined areas distributed to south central and north parts likewise nitrates are mainly concentrated within the southern part of the study area conversely high contents of nitrites and chlorides are located to northern part of the area furthermore high concentrations of physic chemical parameters tb tds ec and ph are located in the central part of the study area distribution of these attributes is not shown here higher temperatures were measured in the south and central parts in groundwater up to 40 c furthermore the distribution of the element content is shown it can be seen that the highest concentrations are in the central part of the study area for sr ca k and mg in the case of as and pb it can be seen that the area with higher concentrations is much more well defined 4 discussion in the present work the vulnerability from selected chemical species was evaluated for an aquifer in an agricultural area under arid conditions where on average the tmax is 30 c precipitation is 2 5 mm year 1 relative humidity is 34 and solar radiation is 20 5 mj m 2 from a statistical point of view the first grouping of chemical constituents pc1 is related to cations formed from sulfur salts mainly oxysalts the conditions of the study site are arid for which the presence of these elements such as sulfur and carbonate minerals is common wang liu et al 2017 as well as because of the use of agrochemical fertilizers barranquero pardo et al 2014 in previous studies the water of this aquifer was classified as calcic sulfated hernández 2012 however the previous study did not considered contributions from infiltration of chemical species from fertilizers the concentrations of elements such as mg s sr k cu and ca are those that contribute to the first statistical grouping of the water quality attributes see table 2 significant correlations in agreement with the principal components were ca with mg 0 84 p 0 01 s 0 93 p 0 01 k 0 95 p 0 01 likewise sr was correlated with mg 0 86 p 0 01 s 0 93 p 0 01 k 0 91 p 0 01 and ca 0 93 p 0 01 the presence of alkaline earth metals such as mg ca and sr chemically similar with oxidation state 2 originate from dissolved rocks such as gypsum caso4 2h2o and limestone 50 caco3 with small amounts of clay hematite siderite quartz aragonite iron oxide among others these attributes are present in the sediments that compose the underlying aquifer under analysis furthermore sr can have its origin in sulfated minerals bhuyan bakar et al 2017 from barite ore deposits presents in study area servicio geológico mexicano 2007 as well as in weathering of rocks with a high level of silicates dubchak 2018 moreover due to its similar chemical characteristics sr shows a great competition or exchange with ca mg and k that originates from minerals such as calcites this relationship can be observed in the spatial distribution fig 4a b c and e in which they have the same pattern dubchak 2018 some of the sampled wells presented values of ca and mg that exceeded the maximum allowable limit for water for consumption and irrigation table 1 according to the mexican regulation 10 of the wells exceed the maximum allowable limit for mg and ca and 13 for k furthermore the increase in the concentrations of ca and mg is related to the dilution of evaporites hernández 2012 valles aragón ojeda barrios et al 2017 the results are similar to those reported for groundwater in india where ca mg and cl showed higher values suma srinivasamoorthy et al 2015 sulfur may come from diverse sources such as minerals of pyrite or as reduced forms of minerals going into groundwater solution thus s and k can also be attributed to their presence in rocks as well as possible lixiviation and infiltration from their contents present in fertilizers that are applied to the crops li yang et al 2017 which is shown in the correlation of over 80 p 0 01 s and k are two of the three primary nutrients required by plants for which they are constantly added to fertilizers silva hidalgo et al 2013 because of this the content of k is found within the allowable limits for irrigation water as established in the international regulations fao 1976 in contrast in water for human consumption k exceeds the maximum allowable limit with values up to 16 mg l 1 fe zn and cu are considered essential nutrients for the optimal development of pecan orchards the concentration of cu in the analyzed water samples is lower compared to what was reported by other authors for groundwater used for irrigation and human consumption arslan and turan 2015 kumar nagdev et al 2019 from these elements only fe exceeded the limit in the regulation although these elements are present in agricultural fertilizers or additives fe and cu can be mainly attributed to their geological origin in the study area in this analysis cu concentrations showed correlation only with fe concentrations 0 66 p 0 01 cu is an element in oxidative state 2 and tends to be present in sulfurous minerals with the presence of fe these elements are found in the rocks due to the hydrothermal solutions that are common in the study area where temperatures up to 35 8 c were measured table 1 the elements that contribute most to the second grouping pc2 are halides zn ph and no2 these chemical species in a similar way can have a geological origin which can be accentuated by the arid climatic conditions present in the study area rajeshkumar liu et al 2018 cl is found dissolved in the water with values up to two orders of a magnitude higher than the allowable value in natural waters chlorine is mainly found in the form of an ion chloride however specifically for this principal component pc2 the determined cl is in element form there was no correlation between chloride and the element cl this could be due to the presence of oxidative agents in the water bhunia keshavarzi et al 2018 musin korolev et al 2018 cl showed a correlation with mg and na p 0 05 which is directly related to the lixiviation of minerals in addition to the excessive use of agricultural soil additives arslan and turan 2015 this element was found above of permissible limits for human consumption in a 77 of sampled water world health organization 2010 in addition presence of mg and na chlorides can be associated to water of geothermal origin which is present in this zone zn is another element considered essential for pecan friut because it is present in the growth and development of the plant due to the arid and soil conditions there is a deficiency of zn in the northern part of mexico for which this element is found in the majority of solvable fertilizers flores 2018 the zn content in the water was found below the maximum allowable limit established by different regulations presented in table 1 br is usually found together with chlorine especially in the form of soluble salts in saline waters it can also be found in rocks sgm 2016 it was correlated with cl 0 97 p 0 01 zn 0 63 p 0 05 mg 0 47 p 0 05 and na 0 52 p 0 05 the ph is one of the indicators of potable water quality because it can produce stress mortality and diseases in aquatic ecosystem valles aragón ojeda barrios et al 2017 this parameter is strongly related to the presence of dissolved ionic species the ph values are found within the limits of the current regulations table 1 and are similar fig 3b to other groundwater studies brindha vaman et al 2014 azpilcueta pérez pedroza sandoval et al 2017 agriculture is the main economic activity in the study area and fertilizers with contents of nitrates and phosphates are used to enhance crop productivity the presence of nitrites in water samples is a reduced form of nitrates the presence of nitrites is due to the oxidative reaction of halide salts such as nacl that reacts with the fertilizer sodium nitrate sappa ergul et al 2014 ground water sampled shows nitrite contents above allowed limits in a 59 and a 52 of sampled wells for irrigation conagua 2009 and drinking water nom 127 ssa1 1994 1994 usepa 1996 world health organization 2010 respectively the third grouping pc3 is related to the solvability of sodium and nitrates as well as with temperature the north of the study area has banks with material of evaporites halite and gypsum sgm 2016 na can vary in groundwater because it is related to the dissolution of rocks and minerals rich in this element obiora chukwu et al 2016 it was found that 30 of the wells exceed the international regulation on water for human use and consumption world health organization 2010 however they do not exceed the reference values for agricultural use see table 1 the high concentrations of this chemical species in mineral form nacl deteriorate in the soil of the agricultural fields because the constant use of water for the irrigation of the crops induces an increase of salts in the soil this leads to a slow or cessation of growth of the crops and intoxicates the plants wang liu et al 2017 nitrates increase because of human activities such as the use of sodium nitrate nano3 fertilizers due to their easy solubility and low cost mapanda mangwayana et al 2005 castañeda gaytán ortega escobar et al 2008 it was found that the concentration of nitrates exceeds the limits established in the regulations nom 127 ssa1 1994 1994 usepa 1996 world health organization 2010 for use and human consume in 33 of the evaluated wells moreover these were found that 37 of sampled water exceed the mexican regulation for irrigation conagua 2002 this indicates a contamination by nitrogen compounds in these areas temperature is related to the mineralization of the groundwater therefore an increase in temperature influences the solubility of some minerals garrido schneider garcía gil et al 2016 of the evaluated wells 52 exceeds the limits in the mexican regulation for drinking water nom 127 ssa1 1994 1994 the origin of the thermal water in this region is associated with the following geological characteristics a the southern extension of the rio grande rift which stretches to the south of chihuahua de la maza benignos lavín murcio et al 2011 and b a local structural deformation from underground irregularities in the surrounding bedrock and the presence of magmatic bodies still in the process of cooling oviedo padrón aranda gómez et al 2010 the components of the remaining three minor groupings pc4 pc5 and pc6 reiterate the presence of dissolved material in the groundwater and their direct relationship with the ec the turbidity they confer as well as the presence of the metal oids as fe and pb the parameter turbidity tb is related to the limited penetration of light through the groundwater in water samples analyzed ec showed significant correlations with na 0 47 p 0 05 cl 0 59 p 0 05 and zn 0 59 p 0 05 this parameter is affected by the amount of dissolved solids in the groundwater fig 3d related to this the ec content is associated with the high amount of dissolved salts where the maximum value found was up to 6 25 ds m 1 azpilcueta pérez pedroza sandoval et al 2017 found ec values up to 3 74 ds m 1 in groundwater for agricultural use these values are lower than those in this study over time the high ec value in the water represents a risk of salinization of the agricultural soil which impacts the crops because the accumulation of salts in the soil prevents the exchange of water and air in irrigation systems in the area castañeda gaytán ortega escobar et al 2008 chlorides are the inorganic ions of larger amounts in natural residual and treated waters azpilcueta pérez pedroza sandoval et al 2017 in the analyzed groundwater values for this ion were found that exceed in 74 both the regulation for irrigation water as well as for human use and consumption additionally chlorides are grouped with tds and t corroborating that the groundwater extracted from these wells has a high content of these elements in agreement with the correlations found p 0 05 the salts such as mg ca na and zn chlorides are those that are mainly present in the analyzed groundwater samples this can be attributed to the ionic exchange of these elements in groundwater which are being leaching from evaporite rocks presents in the zone brindha vaman et al 2014 worked with irrigation water and present similar values with the relation with cl ca mg and na as and pb exceed the limits established by national and international regulations table 1 and these elements showed correlation between them 0 51 p 0 05 the presence of as has already been reported in several studies where its presence in the state of chihuahua is natural hernández 2012 valles aragón ojeda barrios et al 2017 it was found that exceed the allowed limits in a 67 and 30 to drinking water and irrigation respectively the highest concentration of as has been found in areas of contact with the alluvium layer such as the mineralized parts of limestone and ignimbrites and mineralized andesite conagua 1996 thus as was linked to mg 0 49 p 0 05 k 0 52 p 0 05 and ca 0 53 p 0 05 furthermore as also can be present because of anthropogenic contamination such as germicides and insecticides detergents and fertilizers such as arsenic chloride bundschuh litter et al 2012 tripathee kang et al 2016 wang liu et al 2017 thus this can occur from pumpage and or artificial recharge inefficient irrigation where oxygenated waters have mobilized these metals into solution and after to groundwater flow from deep percolation of inefficient irrigation and natural recharge events a prolonged exposure to elevated doses has a carcinogenic effect on humans whereas in plants it inhibit the plant cell growth martínez manjarrez et al 2017 suriyagoda dittert et al 2018 high concentrations of pb are toxic for plant development inhibiting the growth of vegetative cells its origin is in the wear of minerals and rocks that are rich in this element valles aragón ojeda barrios et al 2017 it presents a sanitary risk because it substitutes ca complicating its elimination by damaging the cell walls santoni huneau et al 2016 as is correlated to pb 0 51 p 0 05 their relationship can have its origin in the product of chemical reactions minerals as well as similarity in the transportation or deposit of both metals fig 5 a and b pérez 2004 li yang et al 2017 these correlations are stronger than those reported by selvakumar ramkumar et al 2017 and rajeshkumar liu et al 2018 who worked with groundwater with a high heavy metal content since 1979 an increase in the amount of tds 1936 mg l 1 and the concentration of sulfates 11 0 mg l 1 has been observed the latter is associated with evaporates such as gypsum which forms part of the geological structure and composition of the sediments that compose the aquifer as well as to the gypsum applied as a soil amendment to promote clay flocculation and better soil drainage for agriculture hernández 2012 bhunia keshavarzi et al 2018 the maximum sulfate concentration was up to 5 times the value established as the limit by the regulations it is related to additives such as fertilizers as well as with the wear of the terrain which has an origin of alluvial sediments conagua 1996 inegi 2017 the elevated concentrations can cause gastrointestinal effects upon consuming the water valles aragón ojeda barrios et al 2017 the results are similar to those of brindha vaman et al 2014 and selvakumar ramkumar et al 2017 who also worked with saline groundwater in the statistical analysis the presence of zinc sulfate znso4 was found which is one of the most common used fertilizers li yang et al 2017 furthermore ferrous sulfate salts used for the addition of fe to the plant and plumbic sulfate can stem from the mineral anglesite brindha vaman et al 2014 on the other hand the presence of the higher tds fig 3c supports the relation between these attributes providing a reflection of the high content of dissolved anions and cations in the water ben salem capelli et al 2014 according to the results 93 of the sampled wells exceed the international regulation on water for human use and consumption whereas 37 exceed the mexican regulation moreover in irrigation water it is observed that the maximum concentration of tds exceeds the international regulation whereas at a national level it is up to 6 times higher fao 1976 establishes guidelines for the quality of the water to be used for agriculture these establish that irrigation water with tds values in an interval of 400 2000 mg l 1 has a restricted use of low to moderate and 96 of analyzed wells shows this scenario whereas 2000 mg l 1 presents a severe degree of salinity approximately 22 of wells the presence of all these elements in the study area is supported by the cluster analysis which indicates that there exists a grouping of wells based on the content of these elements fig 2 the results obtained were similar to those of gopal shanmugasundaram et al 2018 where the majority of their water samples were clustered in one large group furthermore our results are similar to those of wang liu et al 2017 that also categorized and associated variables in groundwater moreover the highest concentrations of these elements are found spatially distributed around the center east part of the study area fig 4c and 5c and d where the spatial distribution of the parameters is very similar to other arid places in the world negm and armanuos 2016 jafarabadi bakhtiyari et al 2017 on the other hand the water problem is not only the result of climatic variations that have impacted in a negative way on the hydrological cycle but also a consequence from bad management practices such as increased growths of economic activities urban agriculture mining tourism recreational among others and applying an intensive use of groundwater one of the consequences of the marked increase in groundwater use is the increased salinity in this work the concentrations and distribution of anionic species presents in analyzed water can help to understand the vulnerability of pecan crop nitrate ion is rarely present in the water by dissolution of rock containing nitrates there are conditions to increase the water vulnerability by nitrogen urban or agricultural activities mainly where fertilizers are used nitrogen fixation by vegetation mainly legumes soils textures with high water infiltration low content of organic material lack hydric conditions high water extraction for use from ground or surface supplies low level of natural recharge to the groundwater basin high temperatures of evaporation and potential evapotranspiration geological conditions of aquifer with volcanic rock with abundance of silica promoting geochemical conditions to nitrate persistence cahn and bali 2015 in this study agriculture occupies large areas of land and is the leading activity for region hence the presence of nitrates can be attributed mainly to fertilization of local crops consequently it is considered as an indicator of water contamination puig soler et al 2017 nitrite is also an indicator of a possible contamination of water its presence is due to the oxidation of nh4 or reduction of nitrates in this study high concentrations of nitrates are located to south of study area fig 3b whereas nitrites to north of it fig 3c topographically the surface water runoff is from south to north in the evaluated area it can indicate that nitrites contents are due to leaching of nitrates from surface and its consequent mobilization in the water flow both vertically and laterally passing through to reaches of reduction areas by composition it can be inferred that in the aquifer the resource can be classified as old to ancient water due to presence of sulfates and chlorides with a high salt content however some isotope hydrology analysis and groundwater age dating should be carried out to corroborate it likewise chloride and bromide are the major soluble ions presents in water these elements usually can help to identify sources of salinity thus the cl br ratio is used to determine groundwater quality including groundwater contamination as well as zones with sea water intrusion and its origin hanson 2003 alcalá and custodio 2008 naily and sudaryanto 2018 fig 6 shows the results of chloride bromide analysis the origin of salinity by chloride concentrations in water can be divided in davis cecil et al 2001 naily and sudaryanto 2018 a recharge in well number 2 b agriculture pollution in well number 3 c leaching from natural halides in wells 1 6 and 7 and d leaching from volcanic contribution of halite in remaining wells it can suggest that salinity in the present study is mainly attributed to dissolutions of alluvial sediments and bedrocks presents in the area geologically the area has formations from the precambrian with marine transgressive stages of the upper jurassic gave rise to the evaporite deposit that emerge to the north of the study area comisión nacional del agua 2015 secretaria de gobernación 2015 agriculture is the main economic activity in mexico and for decades the majority of the groundwater in the area has been used for irrigation to support agriculture however soil salinity is a currently problem for crops under several natural and anthropogenic conditions this factor may determines the productivity of farmlands therefore it can help to identify vulnerability areas by salts accumulation an example of areas showing high sar hazard were identified in the mimbres basin new mexico hanson mclean et al 1994 currently these regions have been abandoned for agricultural owing to high salinity accumulation in soils from irrigation with saline groundwater in the study area water shows high ec values in groundwater thus distribution of sar and clr are showed in fig 7 the largest values of sar are mainly to norther part of zone with a highpoint to south fig 7a this zonation may suggest that salinity is primarily related to oxy salts as sulfates and carbonates see figs 3a 4e and 5c and to a lesser extent related to the level to halides see fig 3d all these salts present in water for irrigation are providing an incremental accumulation of salinity in soil and root zone moreover threshold value for ec in soil ece of pecan crops is 2 5 ds m 1 miyamoto riley et al 1986 miyamoto 2006 it represent the water quantity needed to support the productivity soils analyzed showed ece from 0 24 to 4 9 ds m 1 where 30 of orchards are above of that value therefore the clr indicate increased leaching applications of irrigation water up to values of 58 fig 7b this represent a 58 more of irrigation water to leach salts presents in the root zone to maintain the crop productivity this is consistent with other estimates of between 22 60 percent estimated from model simulations boyce hanson et al 2019 and from the rhoades equation ranging from 1 to 88 percent depending on soil and water salinities the salinity leaching efficiency level and crop salinity tolerance cahn and bali 2015 this leaching represents not only an additional overexploitation of the groundwater resources to maintain lower soil salinities but also an additional driver of groundwater quality degradation that will be difficult and expensive to mitigate and reduces the sustainability of the water resources in the state of chihuahua the extraction of groundwater through wells is deeper every time from 1997 2008 the extraction of water increased from 536 to 610 hm3 with more than 90 of these extractions for agricultural purposes conagua 2002 diaz rizo castillo et al 2011 as a consequence there was a water deficit of 135 7 hm3 in 2002 and 142 1 hm3 in 2015 therefore the water quality in the area may decrease with an increase in the depth of extraction the recharge of the study area is from the rio florido this water body is the most important collector at surface water runoff level and originates in the southeast of the study area currently the river presents arid conditions due to prolonged droughts and the presence of two important dams along its channel that regulate surface water flows the dams san gabriel and pico de águila hernández 2012 inegi 2017 the coming years will face increased water demands leading to hydrologic stress if these tendencies continue in addition there will be an increase in the cost of extracting good quality groundwater which will be unattainable by the majority of the habitants in the region sosa rodríguez 2012 wang liu et al 2017 because of all these factors there is no adequate recharge for the area which generates environmental economic health nutritional impacts and social conflict silva hidalgo et al 2013 as well as jeopardizes food and water security for the region 5 conclusion in developed hydrologic systems with mainly agriculture the use of water for intensive irrigation and under conditions of prolonged drought leads to overexploitation of the aquifer which as a consequence produces a high salinity and an increase in the composition of toxic chemical species in the present reconnaissance study a preliminary assessment of risk zones were determined based on the chemical species in an aquifer this study will help set a better framework for more detailed studies of additional sources and constituents that will better describe and allow the understanding of the movement and mixing of these different water types and their effect on resource and agricultural sustainability the results showed a variation in the quality of the groundwater in the area and related potential subregions of risk furthermore a diverse element composition was found which was classified in groups based on their geological and anthropic origins moreover the high concentrations in this area are related to weathering of igneous and sedimentary rocks as well as to the use of fertilizers and herbicides increases chemical species concentrations in the groundwater from the aquifer the initial vulnerability maps of the study area that are based on the spatial distribution of the chemical species show that in general the crops in the central to north part of study area show a higher vulnerability because of the water quality in that area this suggests that in the coming years there will be a severe problem with water quality and quantity in this area because of the environmental geological climatological and chemical conditions it is recommended to conduct periodic and more detailed surveys on the water quality including chemistry of emerging natural and anthropogenic contaminants as well as to look for solutions on the treatment of water with a high salt content and more efficient irrigation methods that may also promote better leaching the immediate consequence will be a further degradation of groundwater quality and increased overexploitation of the water resources and potentially a loss of arable land fit for agriculture thus the sustainability of the water resources land and agricultural industry are all at risk consequently it would be a reduction in the agricultural production and therefore a decrease in the productive competitiveness with other agricultural regions and or its profit and productivity hence it is essential to implement mitigation strategies such as adequate irrigation technification systems in crops to implement procedures for recharge of aquifers to apply efficient resource management policies the data and analyses of the present study provide a novel approach to developing a baseline for the development of proposal and strategies for risk management related to global climate change as well as water availability and quality combining additional geochemical and land and water use surveys with integrated hydrologic modeling will further help to delineate the use and movement of various waters and help to better identify the potential risks and issues delineated within this initial reconnaissance study author contributions aurora

10669,agriculture is one of most important economic activities that requires large amounts of water which in addition to changes in climate presents a major impact on the water availability excess of salt and nutrient concentrations build up damages to soil such as reduced drainage and increase in anoxic conditions in the root zone as well as decreasing productivity and usable farm lands the objective of the present study was to evaluate the chemical vulnerability of an aquifer in arid conditions with a high level of extraction through the detection of risk zones and potential subregions of different risks an evaluation of the quality of the groundwater was performed as a reconnaissance prior to more detailed studies in which samples of 30 wells were analyzed to determine physical chemical parameters recorded in situ dissolved chemical species uv vis spectrophotometry and elemental content x ray fluorescence spectrophotometry concentrations of tds as well as ca mg s cl and as determined in the water under analysis exceeded the limit established for water for consumption and irrigation it is suggests that the origin of the elemental composition is mainly due to the mineral composition of the aquifer sediments the wells were classified in three groups located in different zones based on a alkaline earth elements b halogens c dissolved ions water salinity is mainly composed by sulphates and a lesser extent by hydrochloric salts from leaching of evaporites furthermore the highest chemical vulnerability are located from central to north zone where the soils showed crop leaching requirement by above of threshold value for pecan crops one of the major agricultural products of the valley in conclusion both the salinity and the high level of water extraction for agriculture combined with the arid conditions are provoking an increase in contents of some chemical species in soil of crops the immediate consequences are related to a reduction in the agricultural production and therefore a decrease in the productive competitiveness keywords arid zone chemical species spatial distribution groundwater 1 introduction worldwide there are different regions that are facing severe consequences resulting from climate change and related overexploitation of natural resources such as water and land the latin american region is currently facing situations of severe exposure to climate related risks such as tropical cyclones flooding droughts and heat waves selvakumar ramkumar et al 2017 furthermore the climate has started to present variations for which changes in the climate are expected to occur with higher frequency in the coming decades banco del desarrollo de america latina 2014 in addition the close relationship between human activities and overexploitation of water and land use results in environmental pollution gu gao et al 2016 heavy metals cr cd cu fe hg released from aquifer sediments or from human sources some organic substances solvents hydrocarbons dyes as well as several chemical products resulting from household pharmaceutical industrial and agricultural waste among others are among the contaminants found most commonly in water these can have and acute or chronic impact on the environment wang et al 2014 chacon chumancero et al 2016 the increase in salinity and nutrients has also degraded the productivity as well as the land available for agriculture and has resulted in the need for restrictions and additional assessment of salt and nutrient loadings in major agriculatural areas central valley salinity coalition and cvsalts 2012 collectively these deteriorating conditions threaten the sustainability of the resources as well as food and water security the southeastern part of the state of chihuahua is located within one of the largest semi arid ecosystems in the north of mexico which gives it a fragile state susceptible to droughts the pecan carya illinoinensis is native to northern mexico and is considered one of the most profitable fruit species sagarpa 2011 both for its production nuts and for its timber diaz rizo castillo et al 2011 it is cultivated in the central southern part of the state of chihuahua mainly in the municipalities jimenez delicias camargo and saucillo ojeda barrios et al 2010 because of the ideal climatological conditions a dry semi arid climate hot summers alkaline soil and a long period without frost valles aragón et al 2017 that crop is mainly supplied by groundwater which is not strictly regulated and consequently is potentially not sustainable managed chemical vulnerability of any medium is described by factors such as the degree of disturbance by contaminants from natural or human sources the susceptibility to be contaminated the detrimental effects lack of water quality which limits its beneficial uses and the ability to response and recovery to mitigate and address the risks associated with pollutants belitz jurgens et al 2016 this in turn jeopardizes the agricultural economy of the region as well as food and water security for the region it is important to note that current monitoring programs do not provide a complete spectrum of measurement and analysis of toxic substances that are affecting groundwater quality and agricultural sustainability thus when water conditions are less favorable the major crops suffers from toxicity and a nutrient imbalance chowdhury et al 2016 commonly salinity in addition factors such as high water tables soil type changes in the profile soil compaction soil salinity and soil fertility may restrict root development as a result absorption of nutrients through the roots is reduced lowering growth of the leaves buds and fruits ben salem et al 2014 and overall crop productivity this also requires more irrigation to leach the root zone and this indirectly drives further overexploitation of the groundwater resources because of this studies on the current situation of the aquifers based on the availability of the resource are needed due to the environmental conditions and overexploitation the assessment of chemical vulnerability including emerging contaminants have to be determinted as it has been carried out in zones with intense agriculture practices such as central valley ca usa belitz dubrovsky et al 2003 harter rollins et al 2008 belitz jurgens et al 2016 in that region it has implemented the sustainable groundwater management act that have identified in new laws and regulations that these vulnerabilities are unacceptable and are termed undesirable results from overexploitation of the groundwater resources and conjunctive use of surface and ground water sgma 2014 through the detection of risk areas therefore the evaluation of chemical vulnerability is a useful tool to governmental and private agencies which must consider prioritizing groundwater resource and to implement sustainable management programs to provide not only drinking water but also water of good quality for food production and maintain the health of land and water resources the objective of the present reconnaissance study was to make a preliminary evaluation of the chemical vulnerability of an aquifer under arid conditions and to explore detection of risk and related risk areas with a high rate of consumption and extraction as well as additional potential contaminants without a well defined program of long term management and related limits to uses these deleterious effects can result in further overexploitation and degradation of the groundwater quality plus secondary adverse effects such as groundwater storage depletion and related land subsidence and capture of streamflow 2 materials and methods to identify and delineate potential vulnerability and risk zones based on groundwater availability in an agricultural area the following aspects were evaluated a evaluation of the quality of the groundwater including diverse chemical species and b identification of risk areas based on statistical methods such as pca and cluster analysis combined with risk indicators such as sar and clr to help frame the potential risks to agriculture from various poor quality waters from multiple sources 2 1 study site the aquifer of jimenez camargo is located in the extreme southeast of the state of chihuahua and measures 9947 7 km2 it is located between the coordinates 27 08 north and 104 55 west at a height of 1380 m above sea level inafed 2017 the climate is semiarid with a mean annual temperature of 18 7 c and an average annual precipitation of 380 mm conagua 2008 the study site is located in hydrological region 24 from the rio bravo conchos basin to the rio florido basin the region is influenced by three sub basins rio florido camargo rh24ma rio florido jimenez rh24mb and rio parral rh24md fig 1 the aquifer is almost completely composed of alluvial material located in the lower parts of the valley from the north to the southeast the aquifer jimenez camargo is an unconfined aquifer with some regions semiconfined the surface is composed of sand and gravel and can even contain accumulated clay and or carbonate sulphate minerals therefore its nature generates a high content of some chemical species hernández 2012 sedimentary rocks are present in the aquifer clustered from the north to the southeast as well as limestones shales and sandstones igneous rocks of the following types also outcrop in different areas rhyolites volcanic rocks and basalts conagua 2018 the soil of the aquifer is mainly composed of xerosol which is characteristic of dry areas with a clear and thin surface with highly variable amounts of organic matter depending on the type of texture under this layer there is an accumulation of clay minerals and or carbonates or sulfates at a certain depth there are spots lime agglomerations and gypsum or caliche crystals conagua 2018 in the zone there are mining districts of pb fe zn mn cu and ba servicio geológico mexicano 2007 inafed 2017 inegi 2017 fig 1 shows the location of the study area as well as the locations of the wells sampled 2 2 evaluation of the water quality 2 2 1 water sampling the jimenez camargo aquifer is placed in the municipalities of allende coronado camargo jiménez lópez matamoros and santa barbara in this aquifer there is a total of 1326 wells where 303 of these are inactive the water uses of them are for agriculture 829 urban consumption 105 livestock 54 unidentified 22 diverse 12 and industry 1 in the present study and according to the criteria established to an aquifer scale proportion belitz jurgens et al 2010 a subset of wells was evaluated for this initial reconnaissance in the area of the most intensive agriculture production this area have 208 wells for irrigation and it is located in the municipality of jiménez fig 1 thus water samples from 30 wells used for irrigating pecan producing orchards were analyzed for water quality and water chemistry samples were taken in sterile polypropylene containers of 1 l nom 014 ssa1 1993 1993 that were placed on ice 4 c 1 c until further analysis depth of sampled wells are between 130 150 m sample locations were determined randomly and they were located using a global positioning system gps 2 2 2 measurement techniques parameters measured in situ were temperature t ph turbidity tb electric conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds using a multi parametric equipment hanna hl98130 and a portable turbidimeter hanna hi 93703 to determine anions such as sulfates nitrates nitrites and chlorides a spectrophotometer was used uv vis hach d3900 the determination of the element composition was done with an x ray fluorescent spectrophotometer txrf for this the material used in the equipment was prepared and a chemical process was performed to isolate specific elements prior to the analysis the sapphire disc used in the elemental deposition process was set up using the protocol described in the manual of the equipment thus sapphire discs were immersed in a 10 hno3 solution sigma aldrich at 40 c for 30 min after these were washed with distilled water and acetone sigma aldrich to be dried using fresh air an aliquot of water sample of 995 μl was spiked with 5 μl of 1000 ppm ga standard sigma aldrich and stirring until a homogeneous mixture was achieved from this solution 10 μl aliquot was taken to be deposited in the sapphire discs and put under dryness at 80 c measurement of the inorganic chemical elements na mg s cl fe br as pb sr and zn was performed with a bruker s2 picofox spectrophotometer usa 2 2 3 statistical analysis to determine the origin of obtained variables a pearson correlation matrix was calculated using the procedure corr in package sas 2000 with p 0 05 and p 0 01 then to reduce the number of variables a principal component analysis pca was performed using the procedure princomp sas 2000 with significant values of p 0 05 2 2 4 chemical vulnerability and spatial distribution maps to estimate parameter values for areas with no information on the parameters that were quantified in situ as well as for anions cations and metals present in the water kriging interpolation was used to generate regional estimates as maps of chemical attributes this method uses existing values surrounding the area that is to be estimated raster layers were generated using the program arcgis 10 3 environmental systems research institute 2014 with information linked to the database of the variables analyzed in the present study the interpolations were conducted using the geostatistical analyst extension water irrigation may contain excess of salt and nutrient as well as toxic elements leading to build up damages in soil of crops this has been documented to limit productivity and the overall amount of usable farmland with increased salinity in the arkansas river valley of colorado after decades of agriculture morway and gates 2012 the chemical vulnerabilities related to salinity in water for irrigation were obtained using the sodium absorption ratio sar and the crop leaching requirements clr deflocculating of clays sar is an indicator of damages such as a reduced drainage and an increase in anoxic conditions in the root zone of crops due to soil acts as a water reservoir the clr in the root zone must be known in order to determine how much irrigation water is needed sar and clr were obtained by eqs 1 minhas qadir et al 2019 and 2 rhoades chanduvi et al 1999 laloy javaux et al 2011 respectively 1 sar na ca2 mg2 2 where na ca2 mg2 are the na ca and mg concentrations meq l respectively 2 clr ecw 5 ece ecw where ecw is electrical conductivity of irrigation water and ece is electrical conductivity in soil clr can be multiplied by 100 to obtain the fraction in percent 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the water quality 3 1 1 chemical characterization the samples collected were compared to the mexican regulation nom 127 ssa1 1994 1994 conagua 2009 and the federal law on water rights as well as to the international regulation fao 1976 usepa 1996 oms 2010 in table 1 the results from the water quality analysis are shown values of ph were between 7 06 and 8 59 from neutral to slightly basic ec showed values up to 6 25 ds m 1 whereas tb of 22 2 ntu in addition tds oscillated between 386 and 3115 mg l 1 finally t ranged from 14 to 36 c with 15 wells above 25 c furthermore for anions nitrate values were found from 0 50 to 32 5 mg l 1 whereas nitrites presented concentrations between 0 5 and 7 mg l 1 on the other hand chlorides went up to 1760 and sulfates up to 2175 mg l 1 element composition for elements with concentrations over 1 mgl 1 were observed in the following order of abundance s ca na cl mg k sr whereas the order of abundance for elements with concentrations lower than 1 mgl 1 was p br zn as fe cu pb 3 1 2 statistical analysis the multivariate principal component analysis pca is a factor analysis which statistically is useful for reducing the number of variables to a few components that represent the majority of the variation li yang et al 2017 thus pca is useful in reconnaissance studies because it can help to identify groups of attributes and groups of samples that have similar composition and variability guan hutson et al 2013 ravikumar and somashekar 2017 in the present study the first six components explained 81 7 of the total variation in the wells table 2 the first component pc1 represented 26 45 of the total variation it can be observed that significant variables p 0 05 were mg s sr k cu and ca principal component 2 pc2 represented 19 18 of the variation where significant values were tb and nitrates cl zn and br pc3 was responsible for 13 28 of the variation with t na and nitrites pc4 represented 9 73 with high representation of chlorides tds ec and as pc5 explained 6 95 with sulphates fe and pb finally pc6 explained 6 12 with variables such as ph and k the cluster analysis identified samples with the same location and geological origin that in turn may indicate similar sources chemistry and potential contaminants mohapatra vijay et al 2011 three groupings were identified with an r2 value of 0 70 fig 2 the first group with three wells presents a tds of 916 mg l 1 and a tb of 11 2 ntu indicating moderate to high presence of salts the second group with 18 wells presents high levels of ca 164 mg l 1 mg 16 mg l 1 and k 7 1 mg l 1 whereas group 3 with five wells presents the highest amount of tds with 2073 mg l 1 a t of 30 9 c and cl of 705 mg l 1 for which these last wells are very saline 3 2 spatial distribution of chemical species the results on the spatial distribution of the dissolved ionic species and elements present in the water are shown in figs 3 and 4 and 5 sulphates showed a high concentrations in well defined areas distributed to south central and north parts likewise nitrates are mainly concentrated within the southern part of the study area conversely high contents of nitrites and chlorides are located to northern part of the area furthermore high concentrations of physic chemical parameters tb tds ec and ph are located in the central part of the study area distribution of these attributes is not shown here higher temperatures were measured in the south and central parts in groundwater up to 40 c furthermore the distribution of the element content is shown it can be seen that the highest concentrations are in the central part of the study area for sr ca k and mg in the case of as and pb it can be seen that the area with higher concentrations is much more well defined 4 discussion in the present work the vulnerability from selected chemical species was evaluated for an aquifer in an agricultural area under arid conditions where on average the tmax is 30 c precipitation is 2 5 mm year 1 relative humidity is 34 and solar radiation is 20 5 mj m 2 from a statistical point of view the first grouping of chemical constituents pc1 is related to cations formed from sulfur salts mainly oxysalts the conditions of the study site are arid for which the presence of these elements such as sulfur and carbonate minerals is common wang liu et al 2017 as well as because of the use of agrochemical fertilizers barranquero pardo et al 2014 in previous studies the water of this aquifer was classified as calcic sulfated hernández 2012 however the previous study did not considered contributions from infiltration of chemical species from fertilizers the concentrations of elements such as mg s sr k cu and ca are those that contribute to the first statistical grouping of the water quality attributes see table 2 significant correlations in agreement with the principal components were ca with mg 0 84 p 0 01 s 0 93 p 0 01 k 0 95 p 0 01 likewise sr was correlated with mg 0 86 p 0 01 s 0 93 p 0 01 k 0 91 p 0 01 and ca 0 93 p 0 01 the presence of alkaline earth metals such as mg ca and sr chemically similar with oxidation state 2 originate from dissolved rocks such as gypsum caso4 2h2o and limestone 50 caco3 with small amounts of clay hematite siderite quartz aragonite iron oxide among others these attributes are present in the sediments that compose the underlying aquifer under analysis furthermore sr can have its origin in sulfated minerals bhuyan bakar et al 2017 from barite ore deposits presents in study area servicio geológico mexicano 2007 as well as in weathering of rocks with a high level of silicates dubchak 2018 moreover due to its similar chemical characteristics sr shows a great competition or exchange with ca mg and k that originates from minerals such as calcites this relationship can be observed in the spatial distribution fig 4a b c and e in which they have the same pattern dubchak 2018 some of the sampled wells presented values of ca and mg that exceeded the maximum allowable limit for water for consumption and irrigation table 1 according to the mexican regulation 10 of the wells exceed the maximum allowable limit for mg and ca and 13 for k furthermore the increase in the concentrations of ca and mg is related to the dilution of evaporites hernández 2012 valles aragón ojeda barrios et al 2017 the results are similar to those reported for groundwater in india where ca mg and cl showed higher values suma srinivasamoorthy et al 2015 sulfur may come from diverse sources such as minerals of pyrite or as reduced forms of minerals going into groundwater solution thus s and k can also be attributed to their presence in rocks as well as possible lixiviation and infiltration from their contents present in fertilizers that are applied to the crops li yang et al 2017 which is shown in the correlation of over 80 p 0 01 s and k are two of the three primary nutrients required by plants for which they are constantly added to fertilizers silva hidalgo et al 2013 because of this the content of k is found within the allowable limits for irrigation water as established in the international regulations fao 1976 in contrast in water for human consumption k exceeds the maximum allowable limit with values up to 16 mg l 1 fe zn and cu are considered essential nutrients for the optimal development of pecan orchards the concentration of cu in the analyzed water samples is lower compared to what was reported by other authors for groundwater used for irrigation and human consumption arslan and turan 2015 kumar nagdev et al 2019 from these elements only fe exceeded the limit in the regulation although these elements are present in agricultural fertilizers or additives fe and cu can be mainly attributed to their geological origin in the study area in this analysis cu concentrations showed correlation only with fe concentrations 0 66 p 0 01 cu is an element in oxidative state 2 and tends to be present in sulfurous minerals with the presence of fe these elements are found in the rocks due to the hydrothermal solutions that are common in the study area where temperatures up to 35 8 c were measured table 1 the elements that contribute most to the second grouping pc2 are halides zn ph and no2 these chemical species in a similar way can have a geological origin which can be accentuated by the arid climatic conditions present in the study area rajeshkumar liu et al 2018 cl is found dissolved in the water with values up to two orders of a magnitude higher than the allowable value in natural waters chlorine is mainly found in the form of an ion chloride however specifically for this principal component pc2 the determined cl is in element form there was no correlation between chloride and the element cl this could be due to the presence of oxidative agents in the water bhunia keshavarzi et al 2018 musin korolev et al 2018 cl showed a correlation with mg and na p 0 05 which is directly related to the lixiviation of minerals in addition to the excessive use of agricultural soil additives arslan and turan 2015 this element was found above of permissible limits for human consumption in a 77 of sampled water world health organization 2010 in addition presence of mg and na chlorides can be associated to water of geothermal origin which is present in this zone zn is another element considered essential for pecan friut because it is present in the growth and development of the plant due to the arid and soil conditions there is a deficiency of zn in the northern part of mexico for which this element is found in the majority of solvable fertilizers flores 2018 the zn content in the water was found below the maximum allowable limit established by different regulations presented in table 1 br is usually found together with chlorine especially in the form of soluble salts in saline waters it can also be found in rocks sgm 2016 it was correlated with cl 0 97 p 0 01 zn 0 63 p 0 05 mg 0 47 p 0 05 and na 0 52 p 0 05 the ph is one of the indicators of potable water quality because it can produce stress mortality and diseases in aquatic ecosystem valles aragón ojeda barrios et al 2017 this parameter is strongly related to the presence of dissolved ionic species the ph values are found within the limits of the current regulations table 1 and are similar fig 3b to other groundwater studies brindha vaman et al 2014 azpilcueta pérez pedroza sandoval et al 2017 agriculture is the main economic activity in the study area and fertilizers with contents of nitrates and phosphates are used to enhance crop productivity the presence of nitrites in water samples is a reduced form of nitrates the presence of nitrites is due to the oxidative reaction of halide salts such as nacl that reacts with the fertilizer sodium nitrate sappa ergul et al 2014 ground water sampled shows nitrite contents above allowed limits in a 59 and a 52 of sampled wells for irrigation conagua 2009 and drinking water nom 127 ssa1 1994 1994 usepa 1996 world health organization 2010 respectively the third grouping pc3 is related to the solvability of sodium and nitrates as well as with temperature the north of the study area has banks with material of evaporites halite and gypsum sgm 2016 na can vary in groundwater because it is related to the dissolution of rocks and minerals rich in this element obiora chukwu et al 2016 it was found that 30 of the wells exceed the international regulation on water for human use and consumption world health organization 2010 however they do not exceed the reference values for agricultural use see table 1 the high concentrations of this chemical species in mineral form nacl deteriorate in the soil of the agricultural fields because the constant use of water for the irrigation of the crops induces an increase of salts in the soil this leads to a slow or cessation of growth of the crops and intoxicates the plants wang liu et al 2017 nitrates increase because of human activities such as the use of sodium nitrate nano3 fertilizers due to their easy solubility and low cost mapanda mangwayana et al 2005 castañeda gaytán ortega escobar et al 2008 it was found that the concentration of nitrates exceeds the limits established in the regulations nom 127 ssa1 1994 1994 usepa 1996 world health organization 2010 for use and human consume in 33 of the evaluated wells moreover these were found that 37 of sampled water exceed the mexican regulation for irrigation conagua 2002 this indicates a contamination by nitrogen compounds in these areas temperature is related to the mineralization of the groundwater therefore an increase in temperature influences the solubility of some minerals garrido schneider garcía gil et al 2016 of the evaluated wells 52 exceeds the limits in the mexican regulation for drinking water nom 127 ssa1 1994 1994 the origin of the thermal water in this region is associated with the following geological characteristics a the southern extension of the rio grande rift which stretches to the south of chihuahua de la maza benignos lavín murcio et al 2011 and b a local structural deformation from underground irregularities in the surrounding bedrock and the presence of magmatic bodies still in the process of cooling oviedo padrón aranda gómez et al 2010 the components of the remaining three minor groupings pc4 pc5 and pc6 reiterate the presence of dissolved material in the groundwater and their direct relationship with the ec the turbidity they confer as well as the presence of the metal oids as fe and pb the parameter turbidity tb is related to the limited penetration of light through the groundwater in water samples analyzed ec showed significant correlations with na 0 47 p 0 05 cl 0 59 p 0 05 and zn 0 59 p 0 05 this parameter is affected by the amount of dissolved solids in the groundwater fig 3d related to this the ec content is associated with the high amount of dissolved salts where the maximum value found was up to 6 25 ds m 1 azpilcueta pérez pedroza sandoval et al 2017 found ec values up to 3 74 ds m 1 in groundwater for agricultural use these values are lower than those in this study over time the high ec value in the water represents a risk of salinization of the agricultural soil which impacts the crops because the accumulation of salts in the soil prevents the exchange of water and air in irrigation systems in the area castañeda gaytán ortega escobar et al 2008 chlorides are the inorganic ions of larger amounts in natural residual and treated waters azpilcueta pérez pedroza sandoval et al 2017 in the analyzed groundwater values for this ion were found that exceed in 74 both the regulation for irrigation water as well as for human use and consumption additionally chlorides are grouped with tds and t corroborating that the groundwater extracted from these wells has a high content of these elements in agreement with the correlations found p 0 05 the salts such as mg ca na and zn chlorides are those that are mainly present in the analyzed groundwater samples this can be attributed to the ionic exchange of these elements in groundwater which are being leaching from evaporite rocks presents in the zone brindha vaman et al 2014 worked with irrigation water and present similar values with the relation with cl ca mg and na as and pb exceed the limits established by national and international regulations table 1 and these elements showed correlation between them 0 51 p 0 05 the presence of as has already been reported in several studies where its presence in the state of chihuahua is natural hernández 2012 valles aragón ojeda barrios et al 2017 it was found that exceed the allowed limits in a 67 and 30 to drinking water and irrigation respectively the highest concentration of as has been found in areas of contact with the alluvium layer such as the mineralized parts of limestone and ignimbrites and mineralized andesite conagua 1996 thus as was linked to mg 0 49 p 0 05 k 0 52 p 0 05 and ca 0 53 p 0 05 furthermore as also can be present because of anthropogenic contamination such as germicides and insecticides detergents and fertilizers such as arsenic chloride bundschuh litter et al 2012 tripathee kang et al 2016 wang liu et al 2017 thus this can occur from pumpage and or artificial recharge inefficient irrigation where oxygenated waters have mobilized these metals into solution and after to groundwater flow from deep percolation of inefficient irrigation and natural recharge events a prolonged exposure to elevated doses has a carcinogenic effect on humans whereas in plants it inhibit the plant cell growth martínez manjarrez et al 2017 suriyagoda dittert et al 2018 high concentrations of pb are toxic for plant development inhibiting the growth of vegetative cells its origin is in the wear of minerals and rocks that are rich in this element valles aragón ojeda barrios et al 2017 it presents a sanitary risk because it substitutes ca complicating its elimination by damaging the cell walls santoni huneau et al 2016 as is correlated to pb 0 51 p 0 05 their relationship can have its origin in the product of chemical reactions minerals as well as similarity in the transportation or deposit of both metals fig 5 a and b pérez 2004 li yang et al 2017 these correlations are stronger than those reported by selvakumar ramkumar et al 2017 and rajeshkumar liu et al 2018 who worked with groundwater with a high heavy metal content since 1979 an increase in the amount of tds 1936 mg l 1 and the concentration of sulfates 11 0 mg l 1 has been observed the latter is associated with evaporates such as gypsum which forms part of the geological structure and composition of the sediments that compose the aquifer as well as to the gypsum applied as a soil amendment to promote clay flocculation and better soil drainage for agriculture hernández 2012 bhunia keshavarzi et al 2018 the maximum sulfate concentration was up to 5 times the value established as the limit by the regulations it is related to additives such as fertilizers as well as with the wear of the terrain which has an origin of alluvial sediments conagua 1996 inegi 2017 the elevated concentrations can cause gastrointestinal effects upon consuming the water valles aragón ojeda barrios et al 2017 the results are similar to those of brindha vaman et al 2014 and selvakumar ramkumar et al 2017 who also worked with saline groundwater in the statistical analysis the presence of zinc sulfate znso4 was found which is one of the most common used fertilizers li yang et al 2017 furthermore ferrous sulfate salts used for the addition of fe to the plant and plumbic sulfate can stem from the mineral anglesite brindha vaman et al 2014 on the other hand the presence of the higher tds fig 3c supports the relation between these attributes providing a reflection of the high content of dissolved anions and cations in the water ben salem capelli et al 2014 according to the results 93 of the sampled wells exceed the international regulation on water for human use and consumption whereas 37 exceed the mexican regulation moreover in irrigation water it is observed that the maximum concentration of tds exceeds the international regulation whereas at a national level it is up to 6 times higher fao 1976 establishes guidelines for the quality of the water to be used for agriculture these establish that irrigation water with tds values in an interval of 400 2000 mg l 1 has a restricted use of low to moderate and 96 of analyzed wells shows this scenario whereas 2000 mg l 1 presents a severe degree of salinity approximately 22 of wells the presence of all these elements in the study area is supported by the cluster analysis which indicates that there exists a grouping of wells based on the content of these elements fig 2 the results obtained were similar to those of gopal shanmugasundaram et al 2018 where the majority of their water samples were clustered in one large group furthermore our results are similar to those of wang liu et al 2017 that also categorized and associated variables in groundwater moreover the highest concentrations of these elements are found spatially distributed around the center east part of the study area fig 4c and 5c and d where the spatial distribution of the parameters is very similar to other arid places in the world negm and armanuos 2016 jafarabadi bakhtiyari et al 2017 on the other hand the water problem is not only the result of climatic variations that have impacted in a negative way on the hydrological cycle but also a consequence from bad management practices such as increased growths of economic activities urban agriculture mining tourism recreational among others and applying an intensive use of groundwater one of the consequences of the marked increase in groundwater use is the increased salinity in this work the concentrations and distribution of anionic species presents in analyzed water can help to understand the vulnerability of pecan crop nitrate ion is rarely present in the water by dissolution of rock containing nitrates there are conditions to increase the water vulnerability by nitrogen urban or agricultural activities mainly where fertilizers are used nitrogen fixation by vegetation mainly legumes soils textures with high water infiltration low content of organic material lack hydric conditions high water extraction for use from ground or surface supplies low level of natural recharge to the groundwater basin high temperatures of evaporation and potential evapotranspiration geological conditions of aquifer with volcanic rock with abundance of silica promoting geochemical conditions to nitrate persistence cahn and bali 2015 in this study agriculture occupies large areas of land and is the leading activity for region hence the presence of nitrates can be attributed mainly to fertilization of local crops consequently it is considered as an indicator of water contamination puig soler et al 2017 nitrite is also an indicator of a possible contamination of water its presence is due to the oxidation of nh4 or reduction of nitrates in this study high concentrations of nitrates are located to south of study area fig 3b whereas nitrites to north of it fig 3c topographically the surface water runoff is from south to north in the evaluated area it can indicate that nitrites contents are due to leaching of nitrates from surface and its consequent mobilization in the water flow both vertically and laterally passing through to reaches of reduction areas by composition it can be inferred that in the aquifer the resource can be classified as old to ancient water due to presence of sulfates and chlorides with a high salt content however some isotope hydrology analysis and groundwater age dating should be carried out to corroborate it likewise chloride and bromide are the major soluble ions presents in water these elements usually can help to identify sources of salinity thus the cl br ratio is used to determine groundwater quality including groundwater contamination as well as zones with sea water intrusion and its origin hanson 2003 alcalá and custodio 2008 naily and sudaryanto 2018 fig 6 shows the results of chloride bromide analysis the origin of salinity by chloride concentrations in water can be divided in davis cecil et al 2001 naily and sudaryanto 2018 a recharge in well number 2 b agriculture pollution in well number 3 c leaching from natural halides in wells 1 6 and 7 and d leaching from volcanic contribution of halite in remaining wells it can suggest that salinity in the present study is mainly attributed to dissolutions of alluvial sediments and bedrocks presents in the area geologically the area has formations from the precambrian with marine transgressive stages of the upper jurassic gave rise to the evaporite deposit that emerge to the north of the study area comisión nacional del agua 2015 secretaria de gobernación 2015 agriculture is the main economic activity in mexico and for decades the majority of the groundwater in the area has been used for irrigation to support agriculture however soil salinity is a currently problem for crops under several natural and anthropogenic conditions this factor may determines the productivity of farmlands therefore it can help to identify vulnerability areas by salts accumulation an example of areas showing high sar hazard were identified in the mimbres basin new mexico hanson mclean et al 1994 currently these regions have been abandoned for agricultural owing to high salinity accumulation in soils from irrigation with saline groundwater in the study area water shows high ec values in groundwater thus distribution of sar and clr are showed in fig 7 the largest values of sar are mainly to norther part of zone with a highpoint to south fig 7a this zonation may suggest that salinity is primarily related to oxy salts as sulfates and carbonates see figs 3a 4e and 5c and to a lesser extent related to the level to halides see fig 3d all these salts present in water for irrigation are providing an incremental accumulation of salinity in soil and root zone moreover threshold value for ec in soil ece of pecan crops is 2 5 ds m 1 miyamoto riley et al 1986 miyamoto 2006 it represent the water quantity needed to support the productivity soils analyzed showed ece from 0 24 to 4 9 ds m 1 where 30 of orchards are above of that value therefore the clr indicate increased leaching applications of irrigation water up to values of 58 fig 7b this represent a 58 more of irrigation water to leach salts presents in the root zone to maintain the crop productivity this is consistent with other estimates of between 22 60 percent estimated from model simulations boyce hanson et al 2019 and from the rhoades equation ranging from 1 to 88 percent depending on soil and water salinities the salinity leaching efficiency level and crop salinity tolerance cahn and bali 2015 this leaching represents not only an additional overexploitation of the groundwater resources to maintain lower soil salinities but also an additional driver of groundwater quality degradation that will be difficult and expensive to mitigate and reduces the sustainability of the water resources in the state of chihuahua the extraction of groundwater through wells is deeper every time from 1997 2008 the extraction of water increased from 536 to 610 hm3 with more than 90 of these extractions for agricultural purposes conagua 2002 diaz rizo castillo et al 2011 as a consequence there was a water deficit of 135 7 hm3 in 2002 and 142 1 hm3 in 2015 therefore the water quality in the area may decrease with an increase in the depth of extraction the recharge of the study area is from the rio florido this water body is the most important collector at surface water runoff level and originates in the southeast of the study area currently the river presents arid conditions due to prolonged droughts and the presence of two important dams along its channel that regulate surface water flows the dams san gabriel and pico de águila hernández 2012 inegi 2017 the coming years will face increased water demands leading to hydrologic stress if these tendencies continue in addition there will be an increase in the cost of extracting good quality groundwater which will be unattainable by the majority of the habitants in the region sosa rodríguez 2012 wang liu et al 2017 because of all these factors there is no adequate recharge for the area which generates environmental economic health nutritional impacts and social conflict silva hidalgo et al 2013 as well as jeopardizes food and water security for the region 5 conclusion in developed hydrologic systems with mainly agriculture the use of water for intensive irrigation and under conditions of prolonged drought leads to overexploitation of the aquifer which as a consequence produces a high salinity and an increase in the composition of toxic chemical species in the present reconnaissance study a preliminary assessment of risk zones were determined based on the chemical species in an aquifer this study will help set a better framework for more detailed studies of additional sources and constituents that will better describe and allow the understanding of the movement and mixing of these different water types and their effect on resource and agricultural sustainability the results showed a variation in the quality of the groundwater in the area and related potential subregions of risk furthermore a diverse element composition was found which was classified in groups based on their geological and anthropic origins moreover the high concentrations in this area are related to weathering of igneous and sedimentary rocks as well as to the use of fertilizers and herbicides increases chemical species concentrations in the groundwater from the aquifer the initial vulnerability maps of the study area that are based on the spatial distribution of the chemical species show that in general the crops in the central to north part of study area show a higher vulnerability because of the water quality in that area this suggests that in the coming years there will be a severe problem with water quality and quantity in this area because of the environmental geological climatological and chemical conditions it is recommended to conduct periodic and more detailed surveys on the water quality including chemistry of emerging natural and anthropogenic contaminants as well as to look for solutions on the treatment of water with a high salt content and more efficient irrigation methods that may also promote better leaching the immediate consequence will be a further degradation of groundwater quality and increased overexploitation of the water resources and potentially a loss of arable land fit for agriculture thus the sustainability of the water resources land and agricultural industry are all at risk consequently it would be a reduction in the agricultural production and therefore a decrease in the productive competitiveness with other agricultural regions and or its profit and productivity hence it is essential to implement mitigation strategies such as adequate irrigation technification systems in crops to implement procedures for recharge of aquifers to apply efficient resource management policies the data and analyses of the present study provide a novel approach to developing a baseline for the development of proposal and strategies for risk management related to global climate change as well as water availability and quality combining additional geochemical and land and water use surveys with integrated hydrologic modeling will further help to delineate the use and movement of various waters and help to better identify the potential risks and issues delineated within this initial reconnaissance study author contributions aurora
