12160,the intensive greenhouse crop production in coastal zone of tunisia as monastir and especially teboulba area has increased the demand on groundwater resources for irrigation groundwater which represents one of the major water resources is vulnerable to quality degradation due to over exploitation for agricultural activities and increase of anthropogenic activities the study has been carried out to assess the evolution of hydrochemical properties of monastir aquifers water samples collected from forty six origins between february 2016 and march 2017 were analyzed for physicochemical parameters the results indicate high salinity and high concentration of nutrient and metals trace elements in teboulba groundwater results also indicate that some elements as cadmium and nitrate concentrations are above the tunisian recommended irrigation water limits but remain below fao limits the results of the study suggest that greenhouse intensive agricultural activities including excessive fertilization and irrigation are among processes regulating the nutrient chemistry in the groundwater of this region assessment of groundwater chemical composition showed a seasonal variability given that groundwater is undergoing an important mineralization process and is not suitable for irrigation under ordinary conditions the seasonal evolution of geochemical facies is controlled by complex processes natural and or anthropogenic activities principal component analysis pca indicates that physicochemical variations are regulated by the combination of different processes natural geochemical agricultural and industrial activities result from hierarchical cluster analysis hca indicates a spatial variability of hydrochemical characteristics of teboulba groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater hydrochemical properties variability pca hca 1 introduction groundwater has become the major source of water supply for agricultural drinking domestic tourism and industrial activities delsman 2015 selvakumar et al 2017 rapid industrialization and increasing population have led to an increase in the demand of water supply resulting in an increase of groundwater exploitation the overexploitation of aquifers especially in coastal areas has resulted in seawater intrusion werner and simmons 2009 therefore the use of brackish water for irrigation has consequently led to soil salinization hachicha 2007 the continuing irrigation with saline water may result in leaching of the high amount of salts nutrients and other chemicals elements which could contaminate the groundwater the contamination of groundwater occurs frequently in areas of intensive agriculture el ayni et al 2012 libutti and monteleone 2017 melki et al 2017 greenhouse intensive agriculture is a common practice that has seen a growing development throughout the world indeed it is estimated that there is 405 000 ha of greenhouses spread over all the continents in the mediterranean climate area many countries have become increasingly competitive producers of greenhouse vegetables fao 2013 the intensification of greenhouse crop production has increased the need for pesticide and fertilizer applications and water irrigation consequently redundant pesticides fertilizers and water in the absence of subsurface drainage water in a greenhouse coincided with an increase in the nitrate nutrients and toxic metals concentration of aquifers pedro et al 2017 li et al 2018 in this way many authors have reported that agrochemicals inputs such as fertilizers pesticides herbicides insecticides and other products as veterinary drugs and feed additives are usually associated with serious environmental hazard due to accumulation of contaminants like arsenic as cadmium cd fluorine f lead pb mercury hg and nitrate no3 in agricultural soils zhang et al 2018 libutti and monteleone 2017 udeigwe et al 2015 as a consequence most of areas of intensive agriculture have been affected by non point source pollution of the aquifer in tunisian coastal regions like monastir and teboulba intensive greenhouse vegetable production has grown rapidly and contributes by an important proportion of crop production because excessive fertilization and irrigation is a common agricultural practice needed to be concerned with intensive greenhouse vegetable production systems high amounts of nutrients and toxic elements may leach into groundwater and then contribute to its contamination in these areas the effects of intensive agriculture on groundwater systems are not well documented only a few previous studies bouri and dhia 2010 shojaee et al 2017 were focused on artificial recharge experiments and their impact on teboulba aquifer quantity the present study has turned its attention to quality evolution of this aquifer the specific objectives of this study were to assess the evolution of hydrochemical properties of groundwater under intensive greenhouse agricultural practices which gives an idea about its suitability for agriculture purposes industry and households and helps understanding the origin of change in quality rock water interaction or anthropogenic sources 2 methodology 2 1 study area the choice of the governorate of monastir and the delegation of teboulba as a study area derives from the fact that they know a fast development of intensive agricultural activities and an overexploitation of aquifers that can be considered as representative of the mediterranean context monastir is a coastal mediterranean city fig 1 a located about 150 km from the capital tunis it is geographically positioned at 35 46 10 n and 10 49 10 e and characterized by the extension of lands with low topography showing a slight local variation represented mainly by the mio plioquaternary cliff of monastir and the tyrrhenian hills of ksibet el mediouni on the one hand and by collapsed areas represented mainly by the sebkha of monastir on the other hand souissi et al 2014 monastir region has an average annual rainfall of 328 mm with exceptional rainfall events these events can induce soil erosion processes and flooding the consequences of soil erosion would be mudflows inducing the mobilization of huge sediment volumes both mud and water flooding can affect coastal plain the average annual evapotranspiration climatic deficit maximum and minimum temperature are about 1500 mm 1000 mm 25 8 c and 11 6 respectively this coastal area knows a fast development of intensive agricultural activities indeed there are about 206 greenhouses distributed in three irrigated areas teboulba bekalta and moknine where 19 6 of these greenhouses stay in the same place for a long time the main crops are chili pepper and tomatoes and irrigated with water from the nebhana dam 77 of irrigation water comes from surface water surface wells 39 of irrigation water comes from shallow groundwater and piezometers 7 of irrigation water comes from deep groundwater teboulba area is a located about 25 km south of monastir city and about 175 km from the capital tunis bordered by the mediterranean sea on the east and north the sebkha of moknine on the south moknine plateau on the east and stretching to the plain of bekalta in the southeast the area of teboulba covers a coastal strip of approximately 35 km2 the study area is characterized by a semi arid climate known for the alternation of hot dry summers and rainy winters it has an average annual rainfall evapotranspiration and a climatic deficit of about 300 mm 1734 mm and 1434 mm respectively the average maximum and minimum temperature is 28 c and 10 c respectively most of the attention was given to this mediterranean coastal region where the intensively cultivated area knows a vast extension and pollution is expected currently more than 80 total teboulba area is allocated for agricultural activities and the protected cultures occupy approximately 5 of the surfaces reserved for the vegetable market 2 1 1 hydrological setting the available water resources consist of 1 surface water resources are estimated at 350 mm3 of which 6 mm3 and can be mobilized by dams and small lakes 2 groundwater resources in which monastir basin contains important shallow aquifers like the ones of teboulba moknine and sahline ouerdanine estimated at 8 7 mm3 yr 1 and exploited by large diameter dug wells 3 the deep aquifers are mainly exploited for agricultural activities 82 6 and drinking water 17 4 as for teboulba area it is characterized by a large seaboard and most of flows lead into the sea and the sebkha of moknine which allows us to subdivide it into two hydrological sub basins coastal fringe which produces runoff draining to the sea and continental fringe produces runoff draining to the sebkha the groundwater basin is located in the sand silt plio quaternary formation and covers an area of 35 km2 stretching between the sea in the north and sebkha of moknine in the south this basin is becoming overexploited for agricultural purposes especially as its natural recharge is by rainwater indeed while the rate of abstraction amount is about 1 1 106 m3 year 1 the natural recharge amount does not exceed 0 65 106 m3 year 1 fao 1997 in order to restore the water levels and improve water quality many artificial recharges through wells with surface water from a dam were tested since 1997 2 1 2 pedological setting the study region is characterized by a relatively flat landscape including skanes depression and a monoclonal structure in ne sw direction limited from the west by skanes khnis fault the soils are a majority clayey very calcareous and loaded with fragments of the calcareous shell sandy soils occupy a limited geographical area and occur mainly along the mediterranean coast and along the slopes bordering the sebkha 2 2 sample collection and analysis for this study water samples from forty six origins surface wells piezometers and nebhana dam were collected during the period between february and may 2016 and were the subject of an exhaustive study a total of 51 teboulba groundwater samples was collected randomly from 17 surface wells in may and november 2016 and march 2017 fig 1b into pre washed plastic bottles kept in a cooler box and taken to laboratory for the chemical analysis the chemical analysis of different water samples was done for ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 and 8 selected metals and trace metals fe co cu zn mn cd cr and ni the ph was measured directly using a ph meter according to the method nf en 27 888 1994 ec was estimated using a conductivity meter model 8361 tds is a measure of the residue on evaporation after drying of water samples at a temperature of 105 the dry residue is determined after total evaporation of water in a beaker of 100 ml the determination of sodium and potassium was made by flame photometry nf a20 603 1989 the determination of ca2 mg2 and sulfate so4 2 was done by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta titration method bicarbonates were determined by volumetric methods using sulfuric acid 0 01n cl determination was done by the titration method with silver nitrate innorpi 1989 nt 09 77 ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 concentrations were estimated by kjeldhal method innorpi 1984 nt 09 31 for the determination of fe co cu zn mn cd cr and ni concentrations water samples were filtered and digested with a pure nitric acid mineralization of samples was done by using a berghof mws 2 microwave digester after filtration with ashless filter paper metals concentrations were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry nf fd t90 112 1998 the hydrogeochemical characters irrigation suitability of teboulba groundwater and saturation index were performed by piper diagram riverside plot and phreeqc respectively using diagram software simler 2011 2 3 statistical analysis multivariate statistical analysis is used to study relationships between parameters in the aquifer system and explain the geochemical evolution hca is performed to classify into groups and indicate the linkage between groundwater samples pca is used in order to reduce the data dimension into components and represent different variables in a form explaining their similarities and differences these statistical procedures were performed using ibm spss 20 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 general characteristics of aquifers quality for the general characterization of monastir aquifers water samples were collected from 46 monitoring points belonging to different origins as surface wells with depth ranges between eight and 42m piezometers and nebhana dam the results of the parameter ec tds sar na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl cr cu mn ni zn ni co and fe analysis and the statistical parameters such as minimum maximum mean median and coefficient of variation c v are given in table 1 waters are characterized by a moderate to high salinity with ec values ranges from 1 02 to 13 57 ds m 1 with an average value of 5 21 ds m 1 the mean concentrations of tds is about 3 5 g l 1 both parameters showed a high cv indicating a high variation in the quality of water among different water sample s origins nevertheless the median values are very close to those of the averages indicating the dominance of moderate saline waters the major ion concentrations of water samples showed a relative dominance of sodium and chloride ions the concentrations of na k ca and mg vary from 1145 5 to 1334 11 1 34 16 88 60 12 491 and 78 2 997 05 mg l 1 respectively thus the order of cation abundance is na ca mg k chloride sulfate and bicarbonate concentrations present average values of 1286 83 858 77 and 358 8 mg l 1 respectively indicating that the abundance of anions is in following order cl so4 hco3 overall the high c v for ions reflects the variability source of these elements the concentration of ammonium is observed from 5 60 to 28 00 mg l 1 and with an average value of 16 50 mg l 1 representing water samples with or low degree of contamination many of metals exist naturally at low concentration whereas any increase in their concentration is result of anthropogenic activities huang et al 2014 results of metals and trace metals analysis revealed that studied waters are contaminated by elements unusual to exist in natural aquifers the eight chemical elements are generally present in the majority of water samples however some of water samples do not contain mn ni and zn the mean concentration of metals follows the order of fe zn ni co cr cd mn cu results of the investigation show that among the metals the cd cu and pb concentrations of all sampling origins exceeded that who permissible limit for drinking water concentrations of cr mn and fe exceeded that who permissible limit for drinking water in certain sampling origins however the mean value of ni 0 031 mg l 1 and zn 0 05 mg l 1 remain below the who standard values for drinking water results also showed that the mean values of cd exceeded the tunisian standard value 0 01 mg l 1 for irrigation water 3 2 characteristics of teboulba groundwater 3 2 1 seasonal variability of chemical characteristics although greenhouse crop production vegetables is greatly valued for its important role in teboulba climate environment long term intensification of greenhouse crop production significantly increases the need for pesticide fertilizes applications it has created favorable conditions for water quality degradation especially groundwater in this context the effect of greenhouse intensive agricultural activities on groundwater characteristics was studied water samples were collected from 17 wells at three sampling campaigns may 2016 november 2016 and march 2017 the results of ec tds sar na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl cr cu mn ni zn ni co and fe analysis and the statistical parameters as minimum maximum average median and the coefficient of variation cv are given in table 2 the characteristics of water samples are given in table 2 a table 2 b represents the data for water samples collected in november 2016 and results of water sample analysis collected in march 2017 are summarized in table 2 c 3 2 1 1 ph the ph present only for sampling campaign in march 2017 varies from 7 18 to 7 98 and shows no variation among different water sources indicating the alkaline nature of teboulba groundwater alkalinity in groundwater can be derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals and release of basic industrial and agricultural effluents dinka et al 2015 as mentioned by li et al 2018 a significantly higher ph in leaching water was found under greenhouse conditions suggesting that the ph of the leaching water was significantly influenced by irrigation 3 2 1 2 ec and tds ec and tds showed a slight variation from a season to another indeed the average value of ec in spring 2016 was 5 5 ds m 1 table 2 a decreased to 5 00 in autumn 2016 table 2 b and then decreased to 4 89 ds m 1 in spring 2017 table 2 c conversely to this the mean concentrations of tds increased between spring 2016 and spring 2017 considering ec and tds are related to the ionic concentrations present in the groundwater indeed an increase in tds and a decrease in ec indicate a variation in ionic composition of groundwater all considered groundwater samples showed a tds value greater than 1000 mg l 1 exceeding that who guideline values 2012 for drinking water tds is usually constituted by major cations and anions high value tds in teboulba groundwater could be due to introduce of ions by large input of nutrients and irrigation under greenhouse conditions in similar way and as reported by liang et al 2013 continuous cropping in greenhouses over fertilization and over irrigation for vegetable cultivation not resulted in salt accumulation in the soil but also led to groundwater deterioration discharge of industrial and domestic wastes and intrusion of lake water into the groundwater system and rocks are also important sources of increasing dissolved solids in groundwater dinka et al 2015 selvakumar et al 2017 3 2 1 3 cations under greenhouse conditions sodium is the most dominant cation in the groundwater the concentrations of sodium vary from 245 07 to 1964 26 mg l 1 and the average values calculated for the three sampling campaigns were 642 57 623 48 and 568 31 mg l 1 respectively table 2 a b and c the principle sources of sodium include halite dissolution rock weathering and displacement from absorbing complex of rocks and soils by ca2 and mg2 dinka et al 2015 other factors affecting the concentration of na are the use of excessive amount of fertilizers under open field and greenhouse conditions irrigation return flow and the discharge of industrial and domestic liquid and solid wastes into the nearby land and channel jeyaraj et al 2016 selvakumar et al 2017 the ca2 concentration is higher than that mg2 in the spring season may 2016 and march 2017 with averages of 239 88 and 280 56 mg l 1 respectively however mg2 is dominant only in autumn season with an average of 514 95 mg l 1 the presence of mg2 and ca2 in water is usually associated with chemical weathering leaching from rocks as dolomite marls limestone and from minerals as calcite and magnesite dinka et al 2015 the anthropogenic source of these cations in groundwater is the leaching of pollution from domestic and industrial waste nikanorov and brazhnikova 2012 in natural water mg2 ion is seldom dominant any decrease in ca2 mg2 ratio which is also true for teboulba groundwater in the autumn season suggests that groundwater is undergoing a medium to high mineralization process dinka et al 2015 among cations potassium has the lowest concentration in teboulba groundwater where the average values calculated for the three sampling campaigns are 6 56 4 49 and 13 mg l 1 respectively in general k minerals are resistant to weathering of minerals which explain the low concentrations of potassium in teboulba groundwater 3 2 1 4 anions teboulba ground water is characterized by the dominance of cl which is similar to that of na the content of cl is slightly higher in spring season than in autumn season with mean values of 1295 7 and 1167 37 mg l 1calculated respectively for water sampling campaigns of may 2016 table 2 a and march 2017 table 2 c and an average value of 1070 23 mg l 1 calculated for water sampling campaign of november 2016 table 2 b the presence of cl ions in groundwater might be associated with the leaching from rocks and minerals as chlorine salts and others related mineral salts ramesh and jagadeeswari 2012 dinka et al 2015 it also occurs due to anthropogenic activities anthropogenic sources of cl might be an industrial and municipal waste irrigation return flow and fertilizer inputs anonymous 2013 sulfate is the second most abundant anion in teboulba groundwater and the highest concentration of 2258 85 mg l 1 is recorded in spring season the important sources of sulfate are rock weathering volcanic activities decomposition and oxidation of sulfide and or hydrogen sulfide process and agricultural activities nikanorov and brazhnikova 2012 herojeet et al 2013 dinka et al 2015 the concentration of bicarbonate is relatively low and the mean values for the three sampling campaigns are 301 43 204 42 and 405 73 mg l 1 respectively factors affecting the concentration of hco3 are carbonate rocks dissolution of e g limestone dolomite magnesites and organic decomposition which result in the release of co2 nikanorov and brazhnikova 2012 in general bicarbonate ions are dominant in waters with low and moderate mineralization selvakumar et al 2017 which is not true for this study therefore the low concentration of hco3 infers that teboulba groundwater is undergoing a medium to high mineralization process 3 2 1 5 ammonium results for ammonium table 2 a b and c showed a seasonal variation of mean concentrations indeed the average values of 16 80 mg l 1 and 14 33 80 mg l 1 recorded in the spring season is significantly higher than those of 13 20 mg l 1 recorded in autumn season based on nh4 concentrations of different water samples groundwater is classified into 4 classes including water with low 10 mg l 1 medium 10 15 mg l 1 high 15 20 mg l 1 and very high 20 mg l 1 concentrations the study reveals that in spring season 25 of samples come under first class 40 of samples come under the second class 20 of samples come under and 25 of samples characterize water with very high concentration of nh4 conversely in autumn season 30 of water samples belong to the first class 20 of samples belong to the second class and 50 of the samples are characterized by high concentration of nh4 the highest nitrogen concentrations were noted in spring which corroborates the result of lawniczak et al 2016 this is mainly due to the ammonification of organic matter and nutrient leaching under long term greenhouse condition this result supports the finding of shi et al 2009 who showed that short term vegetable cultivation under greenhouse conditions in southeastern china has led to a rapid accumulation of nitrate in tested fields that caused not only soil degradation but also presented a great pollution potential for groundwater furthermore leaching of nutrient depends on fertilization level type and timing of fertilizer application lawniczak et al 2016 the overall results of this show that concentration of ammonium in different groundwater samples are above the who permissible values for drinking water 0 5 mg l 1 3 2 1 6 metals and trace metals the concentration values of eight metals and trace metals cd cr cu mn ni zn co and fe are given in table 2 a b and c results indicate that the abundance of metals and trace metals in teboulba groundwater are in following order fe zn cr co ni mn cr cd different concentration values are compared with the who standard 2006 the result shows that almost in the all of the samples concentrations of metals and trace metals are higher than the corresponding who values except for zn metals and trace metals are also compared with tunisian standard nt 106 03 of treated wastewater reuse for irrigation results of the investigation show that among the metal and tm in studying groundwater samples the concentrations of fe zn cu co ni mn and cr remain below the tunisian standard values 5 5 0 5 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 0 1 mg l 1 respectively however the mean values of cd are higher than tunisian standard value 0 01 mg l 1 the contamination of teboulba groundwater by trace metals and especially by cadmium is mainly due to the long term use of superphosphate fertilizer by farmers of this region under intensive greenhouse vegetable cultivation conditions which increases the concentration of these elements exceeding the background levels hence the leaching of cadmium from soil by water percolating into groundwater increases the risk of ground water contamination 3 2 2 groundwater classification for irrigation purpose the sar which represents the measure of the amount of na relative to ca2 and mg2 is an important indicator of the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purpose because it is a measure of alkali hazard to crops arumugam et al 2015 indeed the risk of salinization increases in the case of irrigation with water characterized by a high sar to evaluate this risk the correlation between sar and ec were plotted on the riverside diagram fig 2 it has been shown that ec values of most of groundwater samples measured in spring campaign 1 and 3 and autumn campaign 2 remain up to 2250 μs cm 1 and all water samples are distributed between c4 and c5groups thus five classes have been identified c4s2 class representing waters with high salinity and medium sodium hazard c4s3 class representing waters with high salinity and high sodium hazard c5s2 class representing waters with very high salinity and medium sodium hazard c5s3and c5s4 classes representing waters with very high salinity and high sodium hazard c4s2 c4s3 and c5s3 classes indicated that waters are highly mineralized and not suitable for irrigation under ordinary conditions however when these waters are applied for irrigation not only leaching is essential but also the choice of the appropriate crop el ayni et al 2012 the majority of water samples belong to these classes c5s4 class indicated that waters are strongly mineralized have a bad quality and are not recommended for irrigation benguergoura laradj and remini 2014 3 2 3 hydrochemical facies evolution major ions were plotted on the piper diagram piper 1944 in order to study the hydrochemical evolution of teboulba groundwater the analysis of this diagram fig 3 suggests that different sampling points fall with two major types of hydro geochemical facies indeed for the both seasons the majority of the samples belonged to calcium magnesium chloride sulfate and chloride sodium types these facies underline the complexity of the hydro geochemical processes that govern the water salinity of the teboulba groundwater in particular the mixing of water evaporation and the dissolution of evaporitic rocks such as halite gypsum and anhydrite bekkoussa et al 2013 kraiem et al 2015 sajilkumar and james 2016 3 2 4 salinity origins 3 2 4 1 saturation indices the saturation index si is calculated to understand the chemistry of groundwater it gives an indication about the equilibrium state of the water with respect to a particular mineral a saturation index si less than zero indicates that the groundwater is under saturated with respect to that particular mineral and therefore it will take more mineral into the solution a saturation index si greater than zero specifies that the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to the particular mineral phase and therefore incapable of dissolving more of the mineral however if the saturation index is the within 0 5 there a possibility that a mineral examined is in equilibrium with the groundwater paces 1972 1973 the saturation indexes were determined using the phreeqc program for windows parkhurst and appelo 1999 the si of calcite aragonite dolomite gypsum anhydrite and halite are shown in table 3 the results obtained showed that different groundwater samples were under saturated with respect to halite gypsym and anhydrite the results also showed that groundwater was supersaturated with respect to dolomite calcite and aragonite indicating that these minerals can precipitate by the groundwater overall the halite has the lowest saturation index is 4 91 suggesting that salinization of groundwater particularly by na and cl indicates an anthropogenic source rather than natural sources the intensification of greenhouse crop production waste disposal and seawater intrusion are the main potential sources of pollution in this study area 3 2 4 2 interrelationship between chemicals parameters pearson correlation analysis is used to describe the interrelationship between variables the correlation coefficients were calculated and the values of the correlation coefficient are shown in table 4 a the results for 18 hydrochemical parameters show that high positive correlation exists between cl ec na ec ca2 ec na cl hco3 ph and moderate negative correlation exists between ph cu ph ni na cr na ni na cd and ca2 cd moderate positive correlation exists between hco3 k ca2 cl ca2 so4 mg2 cl and mg2 so4 the ec has a high correlation with na cl and ca2 suggest that salinity is controlled by these ions sundaray 2010 thus many sources of na and cl are considered that included chemical fertilizers and saline water used in agriculture seawater industrial effluent and domestic discharges in addition the presence of ca2 in ground water can be related to the presence of undeveloped calcareous crust in this region a moderate correlation between ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 suggests that sulfate can originate from intensive greenhouse agricultural areas due to fertilizer application principal components analysis pca extracts associations among the analyzed parameters and reduces the data dimension into components that explain a portion of the total variance between groundwater chemical variables pca was performed on the teboulba groundwater characteristics using varimax rotation with kaiser normalization which was adopted to elucidate the variation explained by the components pca was applied to the 18 physiochemical parameters and it yielded 5 pcs results representing loading eigen values and percentage of total variance are summarized in table 4 b the five principal components extracted for groundwater quality data sets were based on eigenvalues greater than 1 explaining about 72 35 of total variance in the study area the pc1 pc2 pc3 pc4 and pc5 for teboulba groundwater quality data explained the total variance of 26 73 20 639 15 00 10 92 10 84 and 9 98 respectively pc1was positively loaded with cd cr cu mn ni zn and co it is known that cd cr cu mn ni zn and co in groundwater generally occur in different chemical forms indeed it has been reported that mn and ni occur as soluble oxy anions such as moo2 4 mno2 4 mno 4 and nio 2while the other trace metals like cu cd and zn occur as soluble cations such as cu2 cd2 and zn2 huang et al 2014 in this study concentrations of cr mn ni co and fe showed a low correlation with mg2 and hco3 and a negative correlation with different others chemical elements indicating their different origins natural sources anthropogenic sources or a mixture of these two sources moreover pc1 can be ascribed to the high anion and cation exchange capacity which indicates the anthropogenic sources from wastewater effluents for metals in teboulba groundwater the pc2 is highly correlated with ec na and cl and other parameters have been low negative and positive loadings this result can be explained by the highly positive correlation existing between cl ec and na ec suggesting that high salinity could be due to the uptake of na and cl in groundwater the presence of na and cl in groundwater can result from chemical weathering seawater intrusion and anthropogenic pollution sources as agricultural activities effluents chemical fertilizers irrigation saline water and industrial effluents the pc3 is best represented by ca2 and mg2 such dependence can be confirmed by the analysis of correlation as showing high and moderate positive correlation between calcium ec cl mg2 and na which indicates that teboulba groundwater mineralization can also be controlled by calcium and magnesium in general the sources of ca2 and mg2 may be due to dissolution of rocks and minerals along with leaching of secondary salts by rain water bodrud doza et al 2016 the pc4 shows a positive loading with nh4 and cd which implies the effect of intensive agricultural practices use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers under greenhouse and field conditions the pc5 has loaded with hco3 and fe it has been reported that the reducing environment is one of the main factors for increase concentrations of fe in groundwater huang et al 2014 hco3 may be caused by intensive weathering of carbonate and oxidation of organic waste in groundwater the low positive correlation between fe and hco3 can explain that oxidation of iron can be the origin of the existence of carbonate in teboulba groundwater this statement implies the co effect of the anthropogenic activities and natural processes for concentrations of fe and hco3 in groundwater 3 2 5 spatial similarity and sampling sites grouping hierarchical cluster analysis hca is used to classify groundwater samples into different groups by similar monitoring sites in their salinity and metal and trace metal concentrations the 17 sampling points for teboulba groundwater fall into three clusters fig 4 cluster 1 consists of 4 sampling points wells 2 6 14 and17 the results of water analysis of these samples indicated that ec does not exceed 4 ds m 1 and concentration of metal and trace metals exceeded the permissible limit of drinking who but not the uses for irrigation tunisia nt 106 03 cluster 1 site is located at the west and corresponds to moderate pollution region cluster 2 had the following 7 sample points wells 3 4 7 8 10 12 and 13 cluster 2 appears to be characterized by high salinity 4 ce 6 dsm 1 and high concentrations of metal and trace metals exceeding the permissible limit of drinking who as well as irrigation uses tunisia nt 106 03 the corresponding samples come from wells located close to sebkha of moknine this area is subject to strong pollution by the metals and trace metals originating from industrial effluents municipal wastewater discharges and textile industry and oil mills cluster 3 groups the wells which closed to the mediterranean sea the ec in this area reaches 10 dsm 1 suggesting seawater intrusion 4 conclusion the evolution of hydrochemical characteristics of monastir and teboulba groundwater under greenhouse intensive agricultural activities has been investigated based on their chemical compositions the physicochemical analysis reveals that the groundwater is generally alkaline and very highly saline hydrochemical analysis data showed that the groundwater major ion composition varies from one season to another indicating that groundwater is undergoing a medium to high mineralization process based on riversite plot teboulba groundwater is highly mineralized and not suitable for irrigation under ordinary conditions piper diagram suggest concludes that geochemical facies depended on the season that mineralization of teboulba groundwater is controlled by complex interactions of multiple factors such as water rock interaction irrigation return flow discharges of domestic effluents and the excessive use of fertilizers under greenhouse intensive agriculture in the majority of cases groundwater is found to have a relatively higher concentration of ammonium especially in the spring season exceeding the corresponding who value this statement lets us pretend the contamination degrees of groundwater by nitrate after transformation of ammonium by ammonification process metals and trace metals concentrations exceed the who values but remain below tunisian standard value except for cd hence contamination of teboulba groundwater by trace metals is mainly caused by the discharges of industrial and domestic effluents and the use of agricultural fertilizers especially the superphosphate fertilizer the result from the pca analysis proves that anthropogenic activities agricultural intensification and industrialization of this region and natural processes are both responsible for the most variation of physicochemical characteristic of teboulba groundwater based on hca analysis different chemical parameters showed variations in different water sampling points of the region setting 3 different zones with moderate and high to very high degrees of pollution and all depending on natural geochemical processes and anthropogenic activities within the zone although the results of the present study give information about the evolution of hydrogeochemical characteristics of teboulba groundwater between the two seasons autumn and spring which represents an importance for water resource management in teboulba region a long term assessment study needs to be done to justify the results of this study and improve the knowledge about the hydrogeochemical processes and different chemical interactions responsible for groundwater chemistry evolution furthermore a long term assessment of groundwater levels is recommended in order to prove the presence of seawater intrusion in the teboulba region and develop groundwater models recommendations the national authority ministry of agriculture water resources and fisheries should activate the strategy for rationalizing the management of water uses and demands this strategy is based firstly on the management of the demand by improving irrigation systems replacing some of the hydraulic structures introductions of clean technologies use of modern equipment secondly on the integrated management of the resources by recharge of groundwater to face overdraft and degradation desalination of brackish groundwater improve on industrial wastewater treatment process by the application of new technologies and promote the use of agriculture species tolerant to salinity and hydraulic stress and thirdly on the resource and environmental protection by the improvement of water storage and capture conservation of water resources through pollution reduction by reducing the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers and replacing them by bio pesticides and bio fertilizers and creation of an effective water quality monitoring program including area coverage mapping and sequential scheduling acknowledgement this study was carried out under the regional project for integrated and sustainable management of protected vegetable cropping systems project cléprod in its

12160,the intensive greenhouse crop production in coastal zone of tunisia as monastir and especially teboulba area has increased the demand on groundwater resources for irrigation groundwater which represents one of the major water resources is vulnerable to quality degradation due to over exploitation for agricultural activities and increase of anthropogenic activities the study has been carried out to assess the evolution of hydrochemical properties of monastir aquifers water samples collected from forty six origins between february 2016 and march 2017 were analyzed for physicochemical parameters the results indicate high salinity and high concentration of nutrient and metals trace elements in teboulba groundwater results also indicate that some elements as cadmium and nitrate concentrations are above the tunisian recommended irrigation water limits but remain below fao limits the results of the study suggest that greenhouse intensive agricultural activities including excessive fertilization and irrigation are among processes regulating the nutrient chemistry in the groundwater of this region assessment of groundwater chemical composition showed a seasonal variability given that groundwater is undergoing an important mineralization process and is not suitable for irrigation under ordinary conditions the seasonal evolution of geochemical facies is controlled by complex processes natural and or anthropogenic activities principal component analysis pca indicates that physicochemical variations are regulated by the combination of different processes natural geochemical agricultural and industrial activities result from hierarchical cluster analysis hca indicates a spatial variability of hydrochemical characteristics of teboulba groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater hydrochemical properties variability pca hca 1 introduction groundwater has become the major source of water supply for agricultural drinking domestic tourism and industrial activities delsman 2015 selvakumar et al 2017 rapid industrialization and increasing population have led to an increase in the demand of water supply resulting in an increase of groundwater exploitation the overexploitation of aquifers especially in coastal areas has resulted in seawater intrusion werner and simmons 2009 therefore the use of brackish water for irrigation has consequently led to soil salinization hachicha 2007 the continuing irrigation with saline water may result in leaching of the high amount of salts nutrients and other chemicals elements which could contaminate the groundwater the contamination of groundwater occurs frequently in areas of intensive agriculture el ayni et al 2012 libutti and monteleone 2017 melki et al 2017 greenhouse intensive agriculture is a common practice that has seen a growing development throughout the world indeed it is estimated that there is 405 000 ha of greenhouses spread over all the continents in the mediterranean climate area many countries have become increasingly competitive producers of greenhouse vegetables fao 2013 the intensification of greenhouse crop production has increased the need for pesticide and fertilizer applications and water irrigation consequently redundant pesticides fertilizers and water in the absence of subsurface drainage water in a greenhouse coincided with an increase in the nitrate nutrients and toxic metals concentration of aquifers pedro et al 2017 li et al 2018 in this way many authors have reported that agrochemicals inputs such as fertilizers pesticides herbicides insecticides and other products as veterinary drugs and feed additives are usually associated with serious environmental hazard due to accumulation of contaminants like arsenic as cadmium cd fluorine f lead pb mercury hg and nitrate no3 in agricultural soils zhang et al 2018 libutti and monteleone 2017 udeigwe et al 2015 as a consequence most of areas of intensive agriculture have been affected by non point source pollution of the aquifer in tunisian coastal regions like monastir and teboulba intensive greenhouse vegetable production has grown rapidly and contributes by an important proportion of crop production because excessive fertilization and irrigation is a common agricultural practice needed to be concerned with intensive greenhouse vegetable production systems high amounts of nutrients and toxic elements may leach into groundwater and then contribute to its contamination in these areas the effects of intensive agriculture on groundwater systems are not well documented only a few previous studies bouri and dhia 2010 shojaee et al 2017 were focused on artificial recharge experiments and their impact on teboulba aquifer quantity the present study has turned its attention to quality evolution of this aquifer the specific objectives of this study were to assess the evolution of hydrochemical properties of groundwater under intensive greenhouse agricultural practices which gives an idea about its suitability for agriculture purposes industry and households and helps understanding the origin of change in quality rock water interaction or anthropogenic sources 2 methodology 2 1 study area the choice of the governorate of monastir and the delegation of teboulba as a study area derives from the fact that they know a fast development of intensive agricultural activities and an overexploitation of aquifers that can be considered as representative of the mediterranean context monastir is a coastal mediterranean city fig 1 a located about 150 km from the capital tunis it is geographically positioned at 35 46 10 n and 10 49 10 e and characterized by the extension of lands with low topography showing a slight local variation represented mainly by the mio plioquaternary cliff of monastir and the tyrrhenian hills of ksibet el mediouni on the one hand and by collapsed areas represented mainly by the sebkha of monastir on the other hand souissi et al 2014 monastir region has an average annual rainfall of 328 mm with exceptional rainfall events these events can induce soil erosion processes and flooding the consequences of soil erosion would be mudflows inducing the mobilization of huge sediment volumes both mud and water flooding can affect coastal plain the average annual evapotranspiration climatic deficit maximum and minimum temperature are about 1500 mm 1000 mm 25 8 c and 11 6 respectively this coastal area knows a fast development of intensive agricultural activities indeed there are about 206 greenhouses distributed in three irrigated areas teboulba bekalta and moknine where 19 6 of these greenhouses stay in the same place for a long time the main crops are chili pepper and tomatoes and irrigated with water from the nebhana dam 77 of irrigation water comes from surface water surface wells 39 of irrigation water comes from shallow groundwater and piezometers 7 of irrigation water comes from deep groundwater teboulba area is a located about 25 km south of monastir city and about 175 km from the capital tunis bordered by the mediterranean sea on the east and north the sebkha of moknine on the south moknine plateau on the east and stretching to the plain of bekalta in the southeast the area of teboulba covers a coastal strip of approximately 35 km2 the study area is characterized by a semi arid climate known for the alternation of hot dry summers and rainy winters it has an average annual rainfall evapotranspiration and a climatic deficit of about 300 mm 1734 mm and 1434 mm respectively the average maximum and minimum temperature is 28 c and 10 c respectively most of the attention was given to this mediterranean coastal region where the intensively cultivated area knows a vast extension and pollution is expected currently more than 80 total teboulba area is allocated for agricultural activities and the protected cultures occupy approximately 5 of the surfaces reserved for the vegetable market 2 1 1 hydrological setting the available water resources consist of 1 surface water resources are estimated at 350 mm3 of which 6 mm3 and can be mobilized by dams and small lakes 2 groundwater resources in which monastir basin contains important shallow aquifers like the ones of teboulba moknine and sahline ouerdanine estimated at 8 7 mm3 yr 1 and exploited by large diameter dug wells 3 the deep aquifers are mainly exploited for agricultural activities 82 6 and drinking water 17 4 as for teboulba area it is characterized by a large seaboard and most of flows lead into the sea and the sebkha of moknine which allows us to subdivide it into two hydrological sub basins coastal fringe which produces runoff draining to the sea and continental fringe produces runoff draining to the sebkha the groundwater basin is located in the sand silt plio quaternary formation and covers an area of 35 km2 stretching between the sea in the north and sebkha of moknine in the south this basin is becoming overexploited for agricultural purposes especially as its natural recharge is by rainwater indeed while the rate of abstraction amount is about 1 1 106 m3 year 1 the natural recharge amount does not exceed 0 65 106 m3 year 1 fao 1997 in order to restore the water levels and improve water quality many artificial recharges through wells with surface water from a dam were tested since 1997 2 1 2 pedological setting the study region is characterized by a relatively flat landscape including skanes depression and a monoclonal structure in ne sw direction limited from the west by skanes khnis fault the soils are a majority clayey very calcareous and loaded with fragments of the calcareous shell sandy soils occupy a limited geographical area and occur mainly along the mediterranean coast and along the slopes bordering the sebkha 2 2 sample collection and analysis for this study water samples from forty six origins surface wells piezometers and nebhana dam were collected during the period between february and may 2016 and were the subject of an exhaustive study a total of 51 teboulba groundwater samples was collected randomly from 17 surface wells in may and november 2016 and march 2017 fig 1b into pre washed plastic bottles kept in a cooler box and taken to laboratory for the chemical analysis the chemical analysis of different water samples was done for ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds sodium na potassium k calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 ammoniacal nitrogen nh4 and 8 selected metals and trace metals fe co cu zn mn cd cr and ni the ph was measured directly using a ph meter according to the method nf en 27 888 1994 ec was estimated using a conductivity meter model 8361 tds is a measure of the residue on evaporation after drying of water samples at a temperature of 105 the dry residue is determined after total evaporation of water in a beaker of 100 ml the determination of sodium and potassium was made by flame photometry nf a20 603 1989 the determination of ca2 mg2 and sulfate so4 2 was done by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta titration method bicarbonates were determined by volumetric methods using sulfuric acid 0 01n cl determination was done by the titration method with silver nitrate

were filtered and digested with a pure nitric acid mineralization of samples was done by using a berghof mws 2 microwave digester after filtration with ashless filter paper metals concentrations were measured by flame atomic absorption spectrometry nf fd t90 112 1998 the hydrogeochemical characters irrigation suitability of teboulba groundwater and saturation index were performed by piper diagram riverside plot and phreeqc respectively using diagram software simler 2011 2 3 statistical analysis multivariate statistical analysis is used to study relationships between parameters in the aquifer system and explain the geochemical evolution hca is performed to classify into groups and indicate the linkage between groundwater samples pca is used in order to reduce the data dimension into components and represent different variables in a form explaining their similarities and differences these statistical procedures were performed using ibm spss 20 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 general characteristics of aquifers quality for the general characterization of monastir aquifers water samples were collected from 46 monitoring points belonging to different origins as surface wells with depth ranges between eight and 42m piezometers and nebhana dam the results of the parameter ec tds sar na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl cr cu mn ni zn ni co and fe analysis and the statistical parameters such as minimum maximum mean median and coefficient of variation c v are given in table 1 waters are characterized by a moderate to high salinity with ec values ranges from 1 02 to 13 57 ds m 1 with an average value of 5 21 ds m 1 the mean concentrations of tds is about 3 5 g l 1 both parameters showed a high cv indicating a high variation in the quality of water among different water sample s origins nevertheless the median values are very close to those of the averages indicating the dominance of moderate saline waters the major ion concentrations of water samples showed a relative dominance of sodium and chloride ions the concentrations of na k ca and mg vary from 1145 5 to 1334 11 1 34 16 88 60 12 491 and 78 2 997 05 mg l 1 respectively thus the order of cation abundance is na ca mg k chloride sulfate and bicarbonate concentrations present average values of 1286 83 858 77 and 358 8 mg l 1 respectively indicating that the abundance of anions is in following order cl so4 hco3 overall the high c v for ions reflects the variability source of these elements the concentration of ammonium is observed from 5 60 to 28 00 mg l 1 and with an average value of 16 50 mg l 1 representing water samples with or low degree of contamination many of metals exist naturally at low concentration whereas any increase in their concentration is result of anthropogenic activities huang et al 2014 results of metals and trace metals analysis revealed that studied waters are contaminated by elements unusual to exist in natural aquifers the eight chemical elements are generally present in the majority of water samples however some of water samples do not contain mn ni and zn the mean concentration of metals follows the order of fe zn ni co cr cd mn cu results of the investigation show that among the metals the cd cu and pb concentrations of all sampling origins exceeded that who permissible limit for drinking water concentrations of cr mn and fe exceeded that who permissible limit for drinking water in certain sampling origins however the mean value of ni 0 031 mg l 1 and zn 0 05 mg l 1 remain below the who standard values for drinking water results also showed that the mean values of cd exceeded the tunisian standard value 0 01 mg l 1 for irrigation water 3 2 characteristics of teboulba groundwater 3 2 1 seasonal variability of chemical characteristics although greenhouse crop production vegetables is greatly valued for its important role in teboulba climate environment long term intensification of greenhouse crop production significantly increases the need for pesticide fertilizes applications it has created favorable conditions for water quality degradation especially groundwater in this context the effect of greenhouse intensive agricultural activities on groundwater characteristics was studied water samples were collected from 17 wells at three sampling campaigns may 2016 november 2016 and march 2017 the results of ec tds sar na k ca2 mg2 hco3 cl cr cu mn ni zn ni co and fe analysis and the statistical parameters as minimum maximum average median and the coefficient of variation cv are given in table 2 the characteristics of water samples are given in table 2 a table 2 b represents the data for water samples collected in november 2016 and results of water sample analysis collected in march 2017 are summarized in table 2 c 3 2 1 1 ph the ph present only for sampling campaign in march 2017 varies from 7 18 to 7 98 and shows no variation among different water sources indicating the alkaline nature of teboulba groundwater alkalinity in groundwater can be derived from the dissolution of carbonate minerals and release of basic industrial and agricultural effluents dinka et al 2015 as mentioned by li et al 2018 a significantly higher ph in leaching water was found under greenhouse conditions suggesting that the ph of the leaching water was significantly influenced by irrigation 3 2 1 2 ec and tds ec and tds showed a slight variation from a season to another indeed the average value of ec in spring 2016 was 5 5 ds m 1 table 2 a decreased to 5 00 in autumn 2016 table 2 b and then decreased to 4 89 ds m 1 in spring 2017 table 2 c conversely to this the mean concentrations of tds increased between spring 2016 and spring 2017 considering ec and tds are related to the ionic concentrations present in the groundwater indeed an increase in tds and a decrease in ec indicate a variation in ionic composition of groundwater all considered groundwater samples showed a tds value greater than 1000 mg l 1 exceeding that who guideline values 2012 for drinking water tds is usually constituted by major cations and anions high value tds in teboulba groundwater could be due to introduce of ions by large input of nutrients and irrigation under greenhouse conditions in similar way and as reported by liang et al 2013 continuous cropping in greenhouses over fertilization and over irrigation for vegetable cultivation not resulted in salt accumulation in the soil but also led to groundwater deterioration discharge of industrial and domestic wastes and intrusion of lake water into the groundwater system and rocks are also important sources of increasing dissolved solids in groundwater dinka et al 2015 selvakumar et al 2017 3 2 1 3 cations under greenhouse conditions sodium is the most dominant cation in the groundwater the concentrations of sodium vary from 245 07 to 1964 26 mg l 1 and the average values calculated for the three sampling campaigns were 642 57 623 48 and 568 31 mg l 1 respectively table 2 a b and c the principle sources of sodium include halite dissolution rock weathering and displacement from absorbing complex of rocks and soils by ca2 and mg2 dinka et al 2015 other factors affecting the concentration of na are the use of excessive amount of fertilizers under open field and greenhouse conditions irrigation return flow and the discharge of industrial and domestic liquid and solid wastes into the nearby land and channel jeyaraj et al 2016 selvakumar et al 2017 the ca2 concentration is higher than that mg2 in the spring season may 2016 and march 2017 with averages of 239 88 and 280 56 mg l 1 respectively however mg2 is dominant only in autumn season with an average of 514 95 mg l 1 the presence of mg2 and ca2 in water is usually associated with chemical weathering leaching from rocks as dolomite marls limestone and from minerals as calcite and magnesite dinka et al 2015 the anthropogenic source of these cations in groundwater is the leaching of pollution from domestic and industrial waste nikanorov and brazhnikova 2012 in natural water mg2 ion is seldom dominant any decrease in ca2 mg2 ratio which is also true for teboulba groundwater in the autumn season suggests that groundwater is undergoing a medium to high mineralization process dinka et al 2015 among cations potassium has the lowest concentration in teboulba groundwater where the average values calculated for the three sampling campaigns are 6 56 4 49 and 13 mg l 1 respectively in general k minerals are resistant to weathering of minerals which explain the low concentrations of potassium in teboulba groundwater 3 2 1 4 anions teboulba ground water is characterized by the dominance of cl which is similar to that of na the content of cl is slightly higher in spring season than in autumn season with mean values of 1295 7 and 1167 37 mg l 1calculated respectively for water sampling campaigns of may 2016 table 2 a and march 2017 table 2 c and an average value of 1070 23 mg l 1 calculated for water sampling campaign of november 2016 table 2 b the presence of cl ions in groundwater might be associated with the leaching from rocks and minerals as chlorine salts and others related mineral salts ramesh and jagadeeswari 2012 dinka et al 2015 it also occurs due to anthropogenic activities anthropogenic sources of cl might be an industrial and municipal waste irrigation return flow and fertilizer inputs anonymous 2013 sulfate is the second most abundant anion in teboulba groundwater and the highest concentration of 2258 85 mg l 1 is recorded in spring season the important sources of sulfate are rock weathering volcanic activities decomposition and oxidation of sulfide and or hydrogen sulfide process and agricultural activities nikanorov and brazhnikova 2012 herojeet et al 2013 dinka et al 2015 the concentration of bicarbonate is relatively low and the mean values for the three sampling campaigns are 301 43 204 42 and 405 73 mg l 1 respectively factors affecting the concentration of hco3 are carbonate rocks dissolution of e g limestone dolomite magnesites and organic decomposition which result in the release of co2 nikanorov and brazhnikova 2012 in general bicarbonate ions are dominant in waters with low and moderate mineralization selvakumar et al 2017 which is not true for this study therefore the low concentration of hco3 infers that teboulba groundwater is undergoing a medium to high mineralization process 3 2 1 5 ammonium results for ammonium table 2 a b and c showed a seasonal variation of mean concentrations indeed the average values of 16 80 mg l 1 and 14 33 80 mg l 1 recorded in the spring season is significantly higher than those of 13 20 mg l 1 recorded in autumn season based on nh4 concentrations of different water samples groundwater is classified into 4 classes including water with low 10 mg l 1 medium 10 15 mg l 1 high 15 20 mg l 1 and very high 20 mg l 1 concentrations the study reveals that in spring season 25 of samples come under first class 40 of samples come under the second class 20 of samples come under and 25 of samples characterize water with very high concentration of nh4 conversely in autumn season 30 of water samples belong to the first class 20 of samples belong to the second class and 50 of the samples are characterized by high concentration of nh4 the highest nitrogen concentrations were noted in spring which corroborates the result of lawniczak et al 2016 this is mainly due to the ammonification of organic matter and nutrient leaching under long term greenhouse condition this result supports the finding of shi et al 2009 who showed that short term vegetable cultivation under greenhouse conditions in southeastern china has led to a rapid accumulation of nitrate in tested fields that caused not only soil degradation but also presented a great pollution potential for groundwater furthermore leaching of nutrient depends on fertilization level type and timing of fertilizer application lawniczak et al 2016 the overall results of this show that concentration of ammonium in different groundwater samples are above the who permissible values for drinking water 0 5 mg l 1 3 2 1 6 metals and trace metals the concentration values of eight metals and trace metals cd cr cu mn ni zn co and fe are given in table 2 a b and c results indicate that the abundance of metals and trace metals in teboulba groundwater are in following order fe zn cr co ni mn cr cd different concentration values are compared with the who standard 2006 the result shows that almost in the all of the samples concentrations of metals and trace metals are higher than the corresponding who values except for zn metals and trace metals are also compared with tunisian standard nt 106 03 of treated wastewater reuse for irrigation results of the investigation show that among the metal and tm in studying groundwater samples the concentrations of fe zn cu co ni mn and cr remain below the tunisian standard values 5 5 0 5 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 0 1 mg l 1 respectively however the mean values of cd are higher than tunisian standard value 0 01 mg l 1 the contamination of teboulba groundwater by trace metals and especially by cadmium is mainly due to the long term use of superphosphate fertilizer by farmers of this region under intensive greenhouse vegetable cultivation conditions which increases the concentration of these elements exceeding the background levels hence the leaching of cadmium from soil by water percolating into groundwater increases the risk of ground water contamination 3 2 2 groundwater classification for irrigation purpose the sar which represents the measure of the amount of na relative to ca2 and mg2 is an important indicator of the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purpose because it is a measure of alkali hazard to crops arumugam et al 2015 indeed the risk of salinization increases in the case of irrigation with water characterized by a high sar to evaluate this risk the correlation between sar and ec were plotted on the riverside diagram fig 2 it has been shown that ec values of most of groundwater samples measured in spring campaign 1 and 3 and autumn campaign 2 remain up to 2250 μs cm 1 and all water samples are distributed between c4 and c5groups thus five classes have been identified c4s2 class representing waters with high salinity and medium sodium hazard c4s3 class representing waters with high salinity and high sodium hazard c5s2 class representing waters with very high salinity and medium sodium hazard c5s3and c5s4 classes representing waters with very high salinity and high sodium hazard c4s2 c4s3 and c5s3 classes indicated that waters are highly mineralized and not suitable for irrigation under ordinary conditions however when these waters are applied for irrigation not only leaching is essential but also the choice of the appropriate crop el ayni et al 2012 the majority of water samples belong to these classes c5s4 class indicated that waters are strongly mineralized have a bad quality and are not recommended for irrigation benguergoura laradj and remini 2014 3 2 3 hydrochemical facies evolution major ions were plotted on the piper diagram piper 1944 in order to study the hydrochemical evolution of teboulba groundwater the analysis of this diagram fig 3 suggests that different sampling points fall with two major types of hydro geochemical facies indeed for the both seasons the majority of the samples belonged to calcium magnesium chloride sulfate and chloride sodium types these facies underline the complexity of the hydro geochemical processes that govern the water salinity of the teboulba groundwater in particular the mixing of water evaporation and the dissolution of evaporitic rocks such as halite gypsum and anhydrite bekkoussa et al 2013 kraiem et al 2015 sajilkumar and james 2016 3 2 4 salinity origins 3 2 4 1 saturation indices the saturation index si is calculated to understand the chemistry of groundwater it gives an indication about the equilibrium state of the water with respect to a particular mineral a saturation index si less than zero indicates that the groundwater is under saturated with respect to that particular mineral and therefore it will take more mineral into the solution a saturation index si greater than zero specifies that the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to the particular mineral phase and therefore incapable of dissolving more of the mineral however if the saturation index is the within 0 5 there a possibility that a mineral examined is in equilibrium with the groundwater paces 1972 1973 the saturation indexes were determined using the phreeqc program for windows parkhurst and appelo 1999 the si of calcite aragonite dolomite gypsum anhydrite and halite are shown in table 3 the results obtained showed that different groundwater samples were under saturated with respect to halite gypsym and anhydrite the results also showed that groundwater was supersaturated with respect to dolomite calcite and aragonite indicating that these minerals can precipitate by the groundwater overall the halite has the lowest saturation index is 4 91 suggesting that salinization of groundwater particularly by na and cl indicates an anthropogenic source rather than natural sources the intensification of greenhouse crop production waste disposal and seawater intrusion are the main potential sources of pollution in this study area 3 2 4 2 interrelationship between chemicals parameters pearson correlation analysis is used to describe the interrelationship between variables the correlation coefficients were calculated and the values of the correlation coefficient are shown in table 4 a the results for 18 hydrochemical parameters show that high positive correlation exists between cl ec na ec ca2 ec na cl hco3 ph and moderate negative correlation exists between ph cu ph ni na cr na ni na cd and ca2 cd moderate positive correlation exists between hco3 k ca2 cl ca2 so4 mg2 cl and mg2 so4 the ec has a high correlation with na cl and ca2 suggest that salinity is controlled by these ions sundaray 2010 thus many sources of na and cl are considered that included chemical fertilizers and saline water used in agriculture seawater industrial effluent and domestic discharges in addition the presence of ca2 in ground water can be related to the presence of undeveloped calcareous crust in this region a moderate correlation between ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 suggests that sulfate can originate from intensive greenhouse agricultural areas due to fertilizer application principal components analysis pca extracts associations among the analyzed parameters and reduces the data dimension into components that explain a portion of the total variance between groundwater chemical variables pca was performed on the teboulba groundwater characteristics using varimax rotation with kaiser normalization which was adopted to elucidate the variation explained by the components pca was applied to the 18 physiochemical parameters and it yielded 5 pcs results representing loading eigen values and percentage of total variance are summarized in table 4 b the five principal components extracted for groundwater quality data sets were based on eigenvalues greater than 1 explaining about 72 35 of total variance in the study area the pc1 pc2 pc3 pc4 and pc5 for teboulba groundwater quality data explained the total variance of 26 73 20 639 15 00 10 92 10 84 and 9 98 respectively pc1was positively loaded with cd cr cu mn ni zn and co it is known that cd cr cu mn ni zn and co in groundwater generally occur in different chemical forms indeed it has been reported that mn and ni occur as soluble oxy anions such as moo2 4 mno2 4 mno 4 and nio 2while the other trace metals like cu cd and zn occur as soluble cations such as cu2 cd2 and zn2 huang et al 2014 in this study concentrations of cr mn ni co and fe showed a low correlation with mg2 and hco3 and a negative correlation with different others chemical elements indicating their different origins natural sources anthropogenic sources or a mixture of these two sources moreover pc1 can be ascribed to the high anion and cation exchange capacity which indicates the anthropogenic sources from wastewater effluents for metals in teboulba groundwater the pc2 is highly correlated with ec na and cl and other parameters have been low negative and positive loadings this result can be explained by the highly positive correlation existing between cl ec and na ec suggesting that high salinity could be due to the uptake of na and cl in groundwater the presence of na and cl in groundwater can result from chemical weathering seawater intrusion and anthropogenic pollution sources as agricultural activities effluents chemical fertilizers irrigation saline water and industrial effluents the pc3 is best represented by ca2 and mg2 such dependence can be confirmed by the analysis of correlation as showing high and moderate positive correlation between calcium ec cl mg2 and na which indicates that teboulba groundwater mineralization can also be controlled by calcium and magnesium in general the sources of ca2 and mg2 may be due to dissolution of rocks and minerals along with leaching of secondary salts by rain water bodrud doza et al 2016 the pc4 shows a positive loading with nh4 and cd which implies the effect of intensive agricultural practices use of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers under greenhouse and field conditions the pc5 has loaded with hco3 and fe it has been reported that the reducing environment is one of the main factors for increase concentrations of fe in groundwater huang et al 2014 hco3 may be caused by intensive weathering of carbonate and oxidation of organic waste in groundwater the low positive correlation between fe and hco3 can explain that oxidation of iron can be the origin of the existence of carbonate in teboulba groundwater this statement implies the co effect of the anthropogenic activities and natural processes for concentrations of fe and hco3 in groundwater 3 2 5 spatial similarity and sampling sites grouping hierarchical cluster analysis hca is used to classify groundwater samples into different groups by similar monitoring sites in their salinity and metal and trace metal concentrations the 17 sampling points for teboulba groundwater fall into three clusters fig 4 cluster 1 consists of 4 sampling points wells 2 6 14 and17 the results of water analysis of these samples indicated that ec does not exceed 4 ds m 1 and concentration of metal and trace metals exceeded the permissible limit of drinking who but not the uses for irrigation tunisia nt 106 03 cluster 1 site is located at the west and corresponds to moderate pollution region cluster 2 had the following 7 sample points wells 3 4 7 8 10 12 and 13 cluster 2 appears to be characterized by high salinity 4 ce 6 dsm 1 and high concentrations of metal and trace metals exceeding the permissible limit of drinking who as well as irrigation uses tunisia nt 106 03 the corresponding samples come from wells located close to sebkha of moknine this area is subject to strong pollution by the metals and trace metals originating from industrial effluents municipal wastewater discharges and textile industry and oil mills cluster 3 groups the wells which closed to the mediterranean sea the ec in this area reaches 10 dsm 1 suggesting seawater intrusion 4 conclusion the evolution of hydrochemical characteristics of monastir and teboulba groundwater under greenhouse intensive agricultural activities has been investigated based on their chemical compositions the physicochemical analysis reveals that the groundwater is generally alkaline and very highly saline hydrochemical analysis data showed that the groundwater major ion composition varies from one season to another indicating that groundwater is undergoing a medium to high mineralization process based on riversite plot teboulba groundwater is highly mineralized and not suitable for irrigation under ordinary conditions piper diagram suggest concludes that geochemical facies depended on the season that mineralization of teboulba groundwater is controlled by complex interactions of multiple factors such as water rock interaction irrigation return flow discharges of domestic effluents and the excessive use of fertilizers under greenhouse intensive agriculture in the majority of cases groundwater is found to have a relatively higher concentration of ammonium especially in the spring season exceeding the corresponding who value this statement lets us pretend the contamination degrees of groundwater by nitrate after transformation of ammonium by ammonification process metals and trace metals concentrations exceed the who values but remain below tunisian standard value except for cd hence contamination of teboulba groundwater by trace metals is mainly caused by the discharges of industrial and domestic effluents and the use of agricultural fertilizers especially the superphosphate fertilizer the result from the pca analysis proves that anthropogenic activities agricultural intensification and industrialization of this region and natural processes are both responsible for the most variation of physicochemical characteristic of teboulba groundwater based on hca analysis different chemical parameters showed variations in different water sampling points of the region setting 3 different zones with moderate and high to very high degrees of pollution and all depending on natural geochemical processes and anthropogenic activities within the zone although the results of the present study give information about the evolution of hydrogeochemical characteristics of teboulba groundwater between the two seasons autumn and spring which represents an importance for water resource management in teboulba region a long term assessment study needs to be done to justify the results of this study and improve the knowledge about the hydrogeochemical processes and different chemical interactions responsible for groundwater chemistry evolution furthermore a long term assessment of groundwater levels is recommended in

hybrid solar active with solar pv which is around 25 percent higher than the traditional one is still 15 percent higher than thermal efficiency of the passive without photovoltaics for heat exchanger 1 97 m length and 280 kg mass of water in basins optimal mass flow rates over condensing cover tgo are 0 04 and 0 0025 kg s for maximum energy as the water temperature of the tube collector is higher than that of the pipe the water temperature rises and the distillery rate increases by adding the thermal energy to the solar system the dc pump engine uses just 23 percent of pv module power and the remaining 77 percent of pv module power should be reduced or the pv module s size reduced to make the system saving the nonlinear characteristic equations are more suitable for solar operations even combined with the fpc and pv t system because of an unstable state in climatic parameters therefore non linear equations are found to be more suitable for thermal testing of active solar hybrid pv t thermal power and electrical power are theoretical and experimental results the tracking intensity of solar radiation is beneficial for the thermal power while the tracking intensity of solar radiation adversely affects electrical energy as the consumed electrical power of the pump does not include the power consumed by the energy efficiency based on the electrical pattern of previous literatures their relative values during the daily pump running time from 9 to 5 h daily distillate production and thermal efficient hybrid active solar are still practically the same for every water

heating applications of thermoelectric modules with the active solar still with solar photovoltaic is also good future work which is not considered by the researchers for research work life cycle cost analysis and exergy analysis of the system is also considered as important for the research work use of various sensible and latent heat storage materials with the active solar still with integration

solar still with solar photovoltaics d b singh and tiwari singh 2018 have carried out comparative analysis of pvt integrated partially covered cpc with double slope solar still they also compared the performance of same solar still with single slope solar still in composite climate conditions of new delhi india they concluded that the system is best suited for the generation of electricity as well as distillate output fig 11 shows the schematic diagram of the experimental set up of double slope solar still coupled with n identical partially covered pvt cpc system table 1 shows the increment in distillate output by various researchers with use of solar photovoltaic 4 conclusion from the present review paper following points have been obtained the overall thermal efficiency of the proposed hybrid solar active with solar pv which is around 25 percent higher than the traditional one is still 15 percent higher than thermal efficiency of the passive without photovoltaics for heat exchanger 1 97 m length and 280 kg mass of water in basins optimal mass flow rates over condensing cover tgo are 0 04 and 0 0025 kg s for maximum energy as the water temperature of the tube collector is higher than that of the pipe the water temperature rises and the distillery rate increases by adding the thermal energy to the solar system the dc pump engine uses just 23 percent of pv module power and the remaining 77 percent of pv module power should be reduced or the pv module s size reduced to make the system saving the nonlinear characteristic equations are more suitable for solar operations even combined with the fpc and pv t system because of an unstable state in climatic parameters therefore non linear equations are found to be more suitable for thermal testing of active solar hybrid pv t thermal power and electrical power are theoretical and experimental results the tracking intensity of solar radiation is beneficial for the thermal power while the tracking intensity of solar radiation adversely affects electrical energy as the consumed electrical power of the pump does not include the power consumed by the energy efficiency based on the electrical pattern of previous literatures their relative values during the daily pump running time from 9 to 5 h daily distillate production and thermal efficient hybrid active solar are still practically the same for every water depth the distillation yield and output of all water depths remain almost the same if the pump running times are shortened by 4 h a day 5 future work use of solar photovoltaic with the active solar still is considered as one of the most innovative research works computational fluid dynamics and comparison with the experimental results still unattended by the researchers use of cooling and heating applications of thermoelectric modules with the active solar still with solar photovoltaic is also good future work which is not considered by the researchers for research work life cycle cost analysis and exergy analysis of the system is also considered as important for the research work use of various sensible and latent heat storage materials with the active solar still with integration of solar photovoltaic also unattended by researchers for research work declaration of competing interest authors are not showing potential conflict of interest

12163,the best knowledge of physico geochemical content of water helps to cope with adequacy between water availability and its importance thus in bafia where groundwater is used in households it is mandatory to evaluate and characterize the quality of that water bafia is an important area of cameroon due to its geographical position growing population and associated needs located between an equatorial climate in the western region and a humid tropical climate in the eastern region this area contains an aquifer system that represents sequences of shales mica quarry biotite gneiss post tectonic granites and ortho amphibolite groundwater flows aquifers recharge areas and provides base flows to supply drinking water to study area the objective of this work was to assess the physicochemical and bacteriological quality of groundwater to explain the phenomena that cause its mineralization in and around the bafia area and to correlate these different ions we only included boreholes that had a good flow rate to meet the need to supply a large number of populations with water for domestic use we conducted an analytical study of the physicochemical and bacteriological parameters of the elements collected from the water samples the results were processed using hydro chemical methods piper diagram distribution maps of chemical elements for a study of water typology and multivariate statistical analysis techniques principal component analysis pcr and ascending hierarchical classification cha analysis were used to determine the phenomena causing water mineralization and the links between these waters respectively our results showed that the waters analyzed in the study area were slightly basic and moderately mineralized chemical parameter grades were below the world health organization who standard except for iron most of the water was chlorinated and sulfated calsic and magnesic three phenomena have been at the origin of water mineralization anthropogenic activity recharge of groundwater soil infiltration and water rock contact main ion production mechanism keywords groundwater hydrochemistry multivariate statistical analyses piper diagram cameroon 1 introduction the need of water for humans is more than a matter of prestige it is of vital importance the multiplicity of its use raises the problem of the adequacy between the availability of water and its use this is true both in agropastoral industrial and household use with the urbanization of the localities and the contingent of needs that imply it the need for water is growing environmental issues are needed surface water is not enough to meet these needs groundwater has became the most important source of water supply people using their water supply artisanal wells boreholes and springs face the lack of local standards for the quality of these waters the evaluation of this natural resource using the long term water quality helps in developing new strategies ali et al 2019 bafia area is located in geological group of yaounde in the central african chain numerous geophysical geological and hydrogeological studies have been conducted to better understand the subsoil this led to the knowledge of tectonic accidents the availability of underground layers and the detection of aquifers from these studies groundwater reserves can be identified and their characteristics deduced in the literature the aspect associating hydrogeology and water quality is not well elaborated understanding the groundwater quality is important for the protection of public health and sustainable development of water resources gemechu et al 2019 in many parts of the world demand for freshwater such as groundwater has experienced a slight increase due to population explosion urbanization and domestic activities this led to an apparently increasing concentration of some constituents such as total dissolved solids tds nitrate chloride and sulfate in groundwater ledesma ruiz et al 2015 in addition climate change is projected to exacerbate the pressure on the hydrologic system ledesma ruiz et al 2015 groundwater is also an important part of the water cycle and is used to maintain soil moisture wetlands stream flow gemechu et al 2019 the location of groundwater in space and its physicochemical composition depend mostly on the geophysical events and the course of the latter current analysis has proven that groundwater gets polluted drastically by various factors which include anthropogenic sources such as improper disposal of sewage wastes garbage which have caused a lot of water borne diseases cholera typhoid diarrhoea viral haemorrhagic fever understanding the groundwater quality is important for the protection of public health and sustainable development of water resources however the origin of the mineralization of these waters was not made but the latter would participate in a better knowledge and assessment of the quality of these waters the study intends to evaluate the origin of the mineralization of these waters by hydrogeochemical methods and multivariate statistical analysis techniques hence deduce the quality of theses waters 2 study area 2 1 location topography and climate the area concerned with the present study located in the central region of cameroon department of mbam and inoubou having as its head bafia fig 1 it extends between 04 20 n and 5 n latitude 10 40 e and 11 20 e longitude with an altitude between 1100 and 1300 m it covers an estimated surface area of about 4500 km2 the bafia area belongs to the geological group of yaoundé in the central african chain enyegue a nyam et al 2014 it is watered by several streams the most important of which are the sanaga and the mbam this zone is subjected to an equatorial climate characterized by four seasons which are alternated a great rainy season which goes from mid march to mid july a short dry season which goes from mid july to mid august rainy season which goes from mid august to mid november and a dry season which goes from mid november to mid march fig 1 b the point measurement is 25 c except in areas like bitang and ndakaleng where the temperature is 24 6 c this infinite variation in temperature can be a function of the depth of aquifers the interannual variation of precipitation decreases over the years rainfall is lower for the years 2015 2016 then a rebound in 2017 the average monthly precipitation recorded during the period 2009 to 2017 show a very significant decrease for the months of december january february and march these precipitations are lower than 50 mm and reach a peak of precipitation in the month of october the other months are intermediate precipitations the annual temperatures were recorded during the period 2009 to 2017 we notice that increase these temperatures 2015and 2016 being the coldest years with a maximum temperature of 30 91 c while the warmest year 2009 has an average temperature of 27 16 c 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting there are also important transafrican lineaments characterized by structural directions shearing and dropouts that reflect significant

ledesma ruiz et al 2015 the results from the water analysis were used as a tool to identify the processes and mechanisms affecting the groundwater s chemistry from the study area enyegue a nyam et al 2014 the results of physicochemical analysis are recorded in table 2 the spatial distribution of the chemical parameters is shown in fig 3 the mapping of these elements is a very valuable tool in the vision of the spatial evolution of any chemical constituent the hydrogen potential ph values and the values of the drilling water temperature studied are within the normal range of the world health organization who guideline values more than 66 of the waters in the locality of bafia have a ph of less than 7 they vary between 6 4 and 7 2 for the ph and between 24 6 c and 25 c for the temperature the proof is thus given that these studied waters come from deep aquifers for the most part the electrical conductivity values indicate a wide variation in the chemical composition of the water this varies between a minimum of 13 3 μs cm and a maximum of 505 μs cm despite this variation the electrical conductivity remains low this reflects a weak mineralization of the study area fig 2 according to domenico and schwartz 1998 the circulation of groundwater in the voids of aquifers increases the concentration of chemical elements it is therefore likely that the origin of this weak mineralization is attributed to a weak circulation of water in the fractures of the study area with regard to the values of 13 3 μs cm and 505 μs cm which are less than 400 μs cm and 600 μs cm respectively which correspond to who standards the water from all boreholes can be considered tobe of good quality for consumption by the people chlorine values range from 0 84 mg l to 31 97 mg l they are in who standards 200 mg l the hardness of the water results mainly from the contact of groundwater with the rock formations dewandel et al 2006 the hardness of a natural water depends on the geological structure of the soils crossed in the samples analyzed this parameter shows a small variation from one drill to another this is related to the lithological nature of the geological formation encountered in the study area and the amount of calcium and magnesium contained in this water in the analyzed samples the amount of these ions is also small fig 3 nine 9 of the 15 samples analyzed had iron levels at least twice as high as the who guideline value of 0 2 mg l iron is essential for the human body at very high concentrations it affects the organoleptic properties of the water and also spoils the linen the water points analyzed in the localities of eloa mougo bakoa and tsekane have a much higher iron content whereas the localities of babetta bamoko etoundou ndekalend and nyamsong remain in who standards the presence of significant amounts of nitrite indicates recent contamination resulting from sewage seepage and oxygen deficiency aghzar et al 2002 in our results nitrites and oxygen are low in content we can therefore conclude that there is no recent contamination by seepage water in the boreholes analyze sodium the concentrations of na dissolved ions range from 0 07 mg l ndakaleng nekon to 2 84 mg l diomar with an average value of 0 68 mg l this is due to the recharge of groundwater water sampled at depths infiltration water the dissolved na ions have a high content in the mountain waters and the lowest at the valley level these higher levels are due to the surface water infiltrations and especially the absence of volcanic intrusions and intensive clay formations calcium element ca2 at concentrations varying from 0 to 7 5 mg l with very low values of west nyamzon to the north nyamsong and the southern most pupils nekon to the east bakoa eloa significant levels of diomar tsekane are also observed these high values of ca2 concentrations are due to the intense activity of agriculture to pollution by surface seepage waters and to the geology of the area the negligible presence of ca2 in bamouko is due to the increase in so2 4 ion magnesium levels are low ranging from 0 to 1 88 mg l we note the strongest concentrations in areas such as eloa bakoa nyamzon and diomar but very low compared to surface waters eblin et al 2014 where it varies between 0 267 and 2 43 mg l this relative depletion of mg2 for the waters of the bafia region may be due to saturation or absence of dissolution of magnesium rich carbonated formations dolomites because magnesium in itself could have three origins the first origin is that it could come from the alteration of the ferromagnesian minerals the second is that it could originate from the processes of dissolution of the dolomite and the third process could be the substitution phenomenon between magnesium released from talc and aluminum released from minerals containing aluminum in altered rocks cl ion concentrations ranged from 0 13 mg l nyambai bamouko to 31 97 mg l nekon diomar the mapping of this element shows a high concentration in the eastern part of the valleys to the summits these high concentrations can result in anthropogenic activities that contribute to the increase in chlorides content the low levels are recorded in the northern and western parts gradually increasing towards the southwest part this can be explained by the lack of infiltration of rainwater the dissolved sulfate so4 2 in the waters of the region have an oscillating content between 0 00 mg l tsekane nyambai etounbou and 214 40 mg l bakoa eloa there is a very strong increase in grades at the eastern level they are very concentrated around eloa this may be due to the dissolution of mineral salts potassium k ions play a small role in the mineralization of the water it is present in trace with variants of 0 021 mg l ndakaleng bamouko and 0 818 mg l eloa bakoa and diomar or there is a very high concentration that can come from dissolution of kcl used in fertilizers nitrate no3 is the final stage of oxidation of organic nitrogen nitrates are widely spread in the soil in most waters and plants where they are needed for plant synthesis soluble in water they occur naturally in low concentrations in groundwater as shown in fig 6 or we observe the significant values of nitrate ion south of the valleys to the mountains bamouko babetta to the north around nyamsong northeast eloa bakoa and the weakest values in the west nitrogen sources can be nitrogenous fertilizers the organic matter of the soil by the mineralization organic amendments such as manure and other wastes see fig 7 the ammonium contents are very low nevertheless we observe a high concentration at east around eloa bakoa mougo also around diomar nyamzon to the west this may be due to the small microbiological decomposition of animal and plant proteins these low concentrations also indicate absence of commercial fertilizers taking into consideration the map showing the spatial distribution of aluminium and an increase in the ion content al 3 eloa mougo is recorded the concentrations range from 0 1 mg l to 0 58 mg l allowing us to note a trace of aluminum due to the igneous rocks of the area iron concentrations evolved from south to north with a high concentration at the eloa and bakoa levels reaching a maximum value of 1 35 mg l in the west the concentrations are constant around 0 5 mg l nyamzon the weakest are located in the vicinity of babetta iron is derived from the hydrolysis of iron rich minerals such as biotites pyroxenes or olivines contained in the basement formations that have altered to produce the different sediments iron once released from these minerals is found in its dissolved form fe2 and once in contact with air oxidizes in fe3 to be in insoluble hydrated form limoni having a rust red colour nitrite levels are lower than that imposed by who which is 0 1 mg l with a very strong presence in the south around nekon and s o with diomar but it is present in trace in the north the presence of nitrite in groundwater is usually the result of the oxidation of organic matter related to human activity agricultural or urban which finds explanation mainly through agricultural and cultural practices use of nitrogen fertilisers burning of cotton residues practice of manure pits and infiltration of discharged waters after industrial treatment of cotton the microbial degradation of organic matter naturally occurring in the soil phosphate levels are largely below the who standard the highest phosphate concentrations are those found in the northern part of the study area there is a decrease from the north to the south 4 2 characterization of groundwater hydrochemistry to understand the hydrochemical evolution and determination of the dominant groundwater types in the study area major cations and anions in meq l were plotted on a trilinear piper diagram which indicates the origin of groundwater and the source of their dissolved salts and explains the different processes affecting groundwater characters piper 1944 samaneh et al 2018 the hydrochemical facies of the waters of the locality of bafia are given by the piper diagram fig 4 hydrochemical facies is a term used to describe the bodies of groundwater in an aquifer that different their geochemical characteristics yang et al 2016 from the analysis of this diagram it appears that the waters of this locality are predominantly chlorinated sulfated calsic magnesic with a tendency towards the poles sulfate and chloride for the sub triangle of anions and a tendency towards the poles calcium and magnesium for the subtriangle of cations the waters of some local wells have a tendency towards a different facies calsic chlorinated for the waters of tsekane bitang and nyamsong however the sulfated calcium facies exists and is observed in the water points of ndakaleng mouko and bamouko 4 3 multivariate statistical analysis main components analysis apc the pcr is made from the previously interpreted quatoze parameters it was found table 3 that the variance expressed by the factorial axes f1 and f2 is quite significant 66 6 to observe the overall behaviour of the observations see table 4 correlation coefficient is commonly used to measure and establish the relationship between two variables it is a simplified statistical tool to show the degree of dependency of one variable to the other from the correlation matrix carried out on the fourteen variables table i the analysis of this correlation matrix shows that it has established a perfect correlation between electrical conductivity sodium calcium magnesium potassium and chlorine a good correlation between ammonia electrical conductivity calcium sodium magnesium potassium and chlorine a high negative correlation between phosphate and nitrate factor analysis is a commonly used statistical method to classify and simplify the data and also to find the most important variables in a dataset the analysis of the variables shows that factor 1 expressing 51 06 of total inertia is essentially defined in its positive part by po4 3 nh4 so4 2 mg2 na cl ce ca2 k no2 and in its negative part no3 nitrates nitrite and ammonia have a superficial origin while phosphate magnesia and sulfate originate from clay grés carbonate weathering rock and igneous this grouping expresses the mineralization associated with anthropogenic activity agriculture household and water rock contact the analysis of this axis of mineralization reveals that there is relatively no affinity between the so4 2 no3 no2 po4 3 ions factor 2 expressing 15 57 of total inertia is defined by iron aluminum ph and negative pole by nitrites their close proximity to this axis means that these elements are due to the same phenomenon infiltration of rainwater recharge and alteration of rocks of this grouping which shows an affinity between these elements there is a mineralization linked to rainwater infiltration responsible for the mechanisms of dissolution of evaporation minerals the dispersed grouping of these variables around the f1 and f2 axes shows that the two axes are sources of mineralization to different degrees and account for other source of mineralization fig 5 shows the preponderance of the influence of these phenomena on water mineralization the analysis of this graph shows that obs9 ndakaleng obs14 yanbai obs12 nekon obs1 babetta obs13 nyamzon obs5 bitang obs11 diomar are influenced by anthropogenic phenomena and infiltration waters the waters of bakoa obs2 bassolo obs4 eloa obs6 and diomar obs11 undergo water rock interaction mechanisms tsekane obs15 nyamsong obs10 is linked to superficial infiltration we also note the eccentricity of water points such as mougo obs8 bamouko obs3 so you cannot give accurate information about the mineralization analysis in hierarchical ascending classification fig 6 presents the dendrogram derived from the classification of groundwater in the locality of bafia this dendrogram reveals their similarity which is measured by a dissimilarity index for an elevated dissimilarity index two groupings and sub grouping low dissimilarity are noted for an index of 2000 on a obs7 obs14 obs12 obs1 obs3 obs5 obs8 obs13 obs10 obs15 obs4 obs2 obs11 for an index of 4000 on a obs7 obs 14 obs12 obs1 obs3 obs5 obs8 obs13 obs10 obs15 obs4 obs2 obs11 for

influenced by anthropogenic activity and water infiltration group b concerning obs2 obs11 has more mineralization so the phenomenon preponderant in the acquisition of ions is the water rock interaction bacteriological analysis table 5 summarizes the bacteriological parameters of the prelevated drilling the germ count remains less than 2000 100 ml on all samples no pathogenic micro organisms were found in critical concentration in the specific research of the different germs this led us to assert that no major contamination has occurred between superficial aquifers and deep aquifers 5 conclusion our aim was to evaluate the dominant ions and the geochemical facies of the locality of bafia through the hydrochemical methods on one hand and to explain the phenomena at the origin of the mineralization of these waters in traves the method of analysis in main components on the other hand the projection of the data in the piper diagram shows a tendency of the anions towards the sulfated chloruric and cations to a calcium tendency this representation of the analysis allowed to identify a chlorurate and sulfated magnesium calcium facies and to distinguish two types of water which is in agreement with the findings of the hydrochemical maps and the geology of the zone the projection of the different parameters in the f1 f2 factorial plane shows us that mineralization is 51 06 related to anthropogenic activities agricultural and domestic activity infiltration of water is 15 58 due to water rock interaction mechanisms the affinity between the main source electrical conductivity of mineralization is very well correlated with na ca2 mg2 k cl from the water rock interaction and a lesser correlation with nh4 in addition there is a variation in the opposite direction of the no3 and po4 3 ions as regards the climate a follow up of its evolution over nine years reveals an intensification of precipitation and a constant evolution of temperatures any variability in the chemical elements in the short and long term will not have any impact on its quality due to the presence of undesirable elements in the trace however the impact of the climatic fluctuations could introduce in our waters heavy metals thus damaging the quality as a result we suggest the need to think about putting in place a real water policy this policy would enable the development and renewal of the sector in order to avoid over exploitation mainly through illicit levies appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia

12163,the best knowledge of physico geochemical content of water helps to cope with adequacy between water availability and its importance thus in bafia where groundwater is used in households it is mandatory to evaluate and characterize the quality of that water bafia is an important area of cameroon due to its geographical position growing population and associated needs located between an equatorial climate in the western region and a humid tropical climate in the eastern region this area contains an aquifer system that represents sequences of shales mica quarry biotite gneiss post tectonic granites and ortho amphibolite groundwater flows aquifers recharge areas and provides base flows to supply drinking water to study area the objective of this work was to assess the physicochemical and bacteriological quality of groundwater to explain the phenomena that cause its mineralization in and around the bafia area and to correlate these different ions we only included boreholes that had a good flow rate to meet the need to supply a large number of populations with water for domestic use we conducted an analytical study of the physicochemical and bacteriological parameters of the elements collected from the water samples the results were processed using hydro chemical methods piper diagram distribution maps of chemical elements for a study of water typology and multivariate statistical analysis techniques principal component analysis pcr and ascending hierarchical classification cha analysis were used to determine the phenomena causing water mineralization and the links between these waters respectively our results showed that the waters analyzed in the study area were slightly basic and moderately mineralized chemical parameter grades were below the world health organization who standard except for iron most of the water was chlorinated and sulfated calsic and magnesic three phenomena have been at the origin of water mineralization anthropogenic activity recharge of groundwater soil infiltration and water rock contact main ion production mechanism keywords groundwater hydrochemistry multivariate statistical analyses piper diagram cameroon 1 introduction the need of water for humans is more than a matter of prestige it is of vital importance the multiplicity of its use raises the problem of the adequacy between the availability of water and its use this is true both in agropastoral industrial and household use with the urbanization of the localities and the contingent of needs that imply it the need for water is growing environmental issues are needed surface water is not enough to meet these needs groundwater has became the most important source of water supply people using their water supply artisanal wells boreholes and springs face the lack of local standards for the quality of these waters the evaluation of this natural resource using the long term water quality helps in developing new strategies ali et al 2019 bafia area is located in geological group of yaounde in the central african chain numerous geophysical geological and hydrogeological studies have been conducted to better understand the subsoil this led to the knowledge of tectonic accidents the availability of underground layers and the detection of aquifers from these studies groundwater reserves can be identified and their characteristics deduced in the literature the aspect associating hydrogeology and water quality is not well elaborated understanding the groundwater quality is important for the protection of public health and sustainable development of water resources gemechu et al 2019 in many parts of the world demand for freshwater such as groundwater has experienced a slight increase due to population explosion urbanization and domestic activities this led to an apparently increasing concentration of some constituents such as total dissolved solids tds nitrate chloride and sulfate in groundwater ledesma ruiz et al 2015 in addition climate change is projected to exacerbate the pressure on the hydrologic system ledesma ruiz et al 2015 groundwater is also an important part of the water cycle and is used to maintain soil moisture wetlands stream flow gemechu et al 2019 the location of groundwater in space and its physicochemical composition depend mostly on the geophysical events and the course of the latter current analysis has proven that groundwater gets polluted drastically by various factors which include anthropogenic sources such as improper disposal of sewage wastes garbage which have caused a lot of water borne diseases cholera typhoid diarrhoea viral haemorrhagic fever understanding the groundwater quality is important for the protection of public health and sustainable development of water resources however the origin of the mineralization of these waters was not made but the latter would participate in a better knowledge and assessment of the quality of these waters the study intends to evaluate the origin of the mineralization of these waters by hydrogeochemical methods and multivariate statistical analysis techniques hence deduce the quality of theses waters 2 study area 2 1 location topography and climate the area concerned with the present study located in the central region of cameroon department of mbam and inoubou having as its head

belongs to the geological group of yaoundé in the central african chain enyegue a nyam et al 2014 it is watered by several streams the most important of which are the sanaga and the mbam this zone is subjected to an equatorial climate characterized by four seasons which are alternated a great rainy season which goes from mid march to mid july a short dry season which goes from mid july to mid august rainy season which goes from mid august to mid november and a dry season which goes from mid november to mid march fig 1 b the point measurement is 25 c except in areas like bitang and ndakaleng where the temperature is 24 6 c this infinite variation in temperature can be a function of the depth of aquifers the interannual variation of precipitation decreases over the years rainfall is lower for the years 2015 2016 then a rebound in 2017 the average monthly precipitation recorded during the period 2009 to 2017 show a very significant decrease for the months of december january february and march these precipitations are lower than 50 mm and reach a peak of precipitation in the month of october the other months are intermediate precipitations the annual temperatures were recorded during the period 2009 to 2017 we notice that increase these temperatures 2015and 2016 being the coldest years with a maximum temperature of 30 91 c while the warmest year 2009 has an average

formation encountered in the study area and the amount of calcium and magnesium contained in this water in the analyzed samples the amount of these ions is also small fig 3 nine 9 of the 15 samples analyzed had iron levels at least twice as high as the who guideline value of 0 2 mg l iron is essential for the human body at very high concentrations it affects the organoleptic properties of the water and also spoils the linen the water points analyzed in the localities of eloa mougo bakoa and tsekane have a much higher iron content whereas the localities of babetta bamoko etoundou ndekalend and nyamsong remain in who standards the presence of significant amounts of nitrite indicates recent contamination resulting from sewage seepage and oxygen deficiency aghzar et al 2002 in our results nitrites and oxygen are low in content we can therefore conclude that there is no recent contamination by seepage water in the boreholes analyze sodium the concentrations of na dissolved ions range from 0 07 mg l ndakaleng nekon to 2 84 mg l diomar with an average value of 0 68 mg l this is due to the recharge of groundwater water sampled at depths infiltration water the dissolved na ions have a high content in the mountain waters and the lowest at the valley level these higher levels are due to the surface water infiltrations and especially the absence of volcanic intrusions and intensive clay formations calcium element ca2 at concentrations varying from 0 to 7 5 mg l with very low values of west nyamzon to the north nyamsong and the southern most pupils nekon to the east bakoa eloa significant levels of diomar tsekane are also observed these high values of ca2 concentrations are due to the intense activity of agriculture to pollution by surface seepage waters and to the geology of the area the negligible presence of ca2 in bamouko is due to the increase in so2 4 ion magnesium levels are low ranging from 0 to 1 88 mg l we note the strongest concentrations in areas such as eloa bakoa nyamzon and diomar but very low compared to surface waters eblin et al 2014 where it varies between 0 267 and 2 43 mg l this relative depletion of mg2 for the waters of the bafia region may be due to saturation or absence of dissolution of magnesium rich carbonated formations dolomites because magnesium in itself could have three origins the first origin is that it could come from the alteration of the ferromagnesian minerals the second is that it could originate from the processes of dissolution of the dolomite and the third process could be the substitution phenomenon between magnesium released from talc and aluminum released from minerals containing aluminum in altered rocks cl ion concentrations ranged from 0 13 mg l nyambai bamouko to 31 97 mg l nekon diomar the mapping of this element shows a high concentration in the eastern part of the valleys to the summits these high concentrations can result in anthropogenic activities that contribute to the increase in chlorides content the low levels are recorded in the northern and western parts gradually increasing towards the southwest part this can be explained by the lack of infiltration of rainwater the dissolved sulfate so4 2 in the waters of the region have an oscillating content between 0 00 mg l tsekane nyambai etounbou and 214 40 mg l bakoa eloa there is a very strong increase in grades at the eastern level they are very concentrated around eloa this may be due to the dissolution of mineral salts potassium k ions play a small role in the mineralization of the water it is present in trace with variants of 0 021 mg l ndakaleng bamouko and 0 818 mg l eloa bakoa and diomar or there is a very high concentration that can come from dissolution of kcl used in fertilizers nitrate no3 is the final stage of oxidation of organic nitrogen nitrates are widely spread in the soil in most waters and plants where they are needed for plant synthesis soluble in water they occur naturally in low concentrations in groundwater as shown in fig 6 or we observe the significant values of nitrate ion south of the valleys to the mountains bamouko babetta to the north around nyamsong northeast eloa bakoa and the weakest values in the west nitrogen sources can be nitrogenous fertilizers the organic matter of the soil by the mineralization organic amendments such as manure and other wastes see fig 7 the ammonium contents are very low nevertheless we observe a high concentration at east around eloa bakoa mougo also around diomar nyamzon to the west this may be due to the small microbiological decomposition of animal and plant proteins these low concentrations also indicate absence of commercial fertilizers taking into consideration the map showing the spatial distribution of aluminium and an increase in the ion content al 3 eloa mougo is recorded the concentrations range from 0 1 mg l to 0 58 mg l allowing us to note a trace of aluminum due to the igneous rocks of the area iron concentrations evolved from south to north with a high concentration at the eloa and bakoa levels reaching a maximum value of 1 35 mg l in the west the concentrations are constant around 0 5 mg l nyamzon the weakest are located in the vicinity of babetta iron is derived from the hydrolysis of iron rich minerals such as biotites pyroxenes or olivines contained in the basement formations that have altered to produce the different sediments iron once released from these minerals is found in its dissolved form fe2 and once in contact with air oxidizes in fe3 to be in insoluble hydrated form limoni having a rust red colour nitrite levels are lower than that imposed by who which is 0 1 mg l with a very strong presence in the south around nekon and s o with diomar but it is present in trace in the north the presence of nitrite in groundwater is usually the result of the oxidation of organic matter related to human activity agricultural or urban which finds explanation mainly through agricultural and cultural practices use of nitrogen fertilisers burning of cotton residues practice of manure pits and infiltration of discharged waters after industrial treatment of cotton the microbial degradation of organic matter naturally occurring in the soil phosphate levels are largely below the who standard the highest phosphate concentrations are those found in the northern part of the study area there is a decrease from the north to the south 4 2 characterization of groundwater hydrochemistry to understand the hydrochemical evolution and determination of the dominant groundwater types in the study area major cations and anions in meq l were plotted on a trilinear piper diagram which indicates the origin of groundwater and the source of their dissolved salts and explains the different processes affecting groundwater characters piper 1944 samaneh et al 2018 the hydrochemical facies of the waters of the locality of bafia are given by the piper diagram fig 4 hydrochemical facies is a term used to describe the bodies of groundwater in an aquifer that different their geochemical characteristics yang et al 2016 from the analysis of this diagram it appears that the waters of this locality are predominantly chlorinated sulfated calsic magnesic with a tendency towards the poles sulfate and chloride for the sub triangle of anions and a tendency towards the poles calcium and magnesium for the subtriangle of cations the waters of some local wells have a tendency towards a different facies calsic chlorinated for the waters of tsekane bitang and nyamsong however the sulfated calcium facies exists and is observed in the water points of ndakaleng mouko and bamouko 4 3 multivariate statistical analysis main components analysis apc the pcr is made from the previously interpreted quatoze parameters it was found table 3 that the variance expressed by the factorial axes f1 and f2 is quite significant 66 6 to observe the overall behaviour of the observations see table 4 correlation coefficient is commonly used to measure and establish the relationship between two variables it is a simplified statistical tool to show the degree of dependency of one variable to the other from the correlation matrix carried out on the fourteen variables table i the analysis of this correlation matrix shows that it has established a perfect correlation between electrical conductivity sodium calcium magnesium potassium and chlorine a good correlation between ammonia electrical conductivity calcium sodium magnesium potassium and chlorine a high negative correlation between phosphate and nitrate factor analysis is a commonly used statistical method to classify and simplify the data and also to find the most important variables in a dataset the analysis of the variables shows that factor 1 expressing 51 06 of total inertia is essentially defined in its positive part by po4 3 nh4 so4 2 mg2 na cl ce ca2 k no2 and in its negative part no3 nitrates nitrite and ammonia have a superficial origin while phosphate magnesia and sulfate originate from clay grés carbonate weathering rock and igneous this grouping expresses the mineralization associated with anthropogenic activity agriculture household and water rock contact the analysis of this axis of mineralization reveals that there is relatively no affinity between the so4 2 no3 no2 po4 3 ions factor 2 expressing 15 57 of total inertia is defined by iron aluminum ph and negative pole by nitrites their close proximity to this axis means that these elements are due to the same phenomenon infiltration of rainwater recharge and alteration of rocks of this grouping which shows an affinity between these elements there is a mineralization linked to rainwater infiltration responsible for the mechanisms of dissolution of evaporation minerals the dispersed grouping of these variables around the f1 and f2 axes shows that the two axes are sources of mineralization to different degrees and account for other source of mineralization fig 5 shows the preponderance of the influence of these phenomena on water mineralization the analysis of this graph shows that obs9 ndakaleng obs14 yanbai obs12 nekon obs1 babetta obs13 nyamzon obs5 bitang obs11 diomar are influenced by anthropogenic phenomena and infiltration waters the waters of bakoa obs2 bassolo obs4 eloa obs6 and diomar obs11 undergo water rock interaction mechanisms tsekane obs15 nyamsong obs10 is linked to superficial infiltration we also note the eccentricity of water points such as mougo obs8 bamouko obs3 so you cannot give accurate information about the mineralization analysis in hierarchical ascending classification fig 6 presents the dendrogram derived from the classification of groundwater in the locality of bafia this dendrogram reveals their similarity which is measured by a dissimilarity index for an elevated dissimilarity index two groupings and sub grouping low dissimilarity are noted for an index of 2000 on a obs7 obs14 obs12 obs1 obs3 obs5 obs8 obs13 obs10 obs15 obs4 obs2 obs11 for an index of 4000 on a obs7 obs 14 obs12 obs1 obs3 obs5 obs8 obs13 obs10 obs15 obs4 obs2 obs11 for an index of 800 on a obs7 obs 14 obs12 obs1 obs3 obs5 obs8 obs13 obs10 obs15 obs4 obs2 obs11 group a represents by obs7 obs 14 obs12 obs1 obs3 obs5 obs8 obs13 obs10 obs15 obs4 have less mineralization influenced by anthropogenic activity and water infiltration group b concerning obs2 obs11 has more mineralization so the phenomenon preponderant in the acquisition of ions is the water rock interaction bacteriological analysis table 5 summarizes the bacteriological parameters of the prelevated drilling the germ count remains less than 2000 100 ml on all samples no pathogenic micro organisms were found in critical concentration in the specific research of the different germs this led us to assert that no major contamination has occurred between superficial aquifers and deep aquifers 5 conclusion our aim was to evaluate the dominant ions and the geochemical facies of the locality of bafia through the hydrochemical methods on one hand and to explain the phenomena at the origin of the mineralization of these waters in traves the method of analysis in main components on the other hand the projection of the data in the piper diagram shows a tendency of the anions towards the sulfated chloruric and cations to a calcium tendency this representation of the analysis allowed to identify a chlorurate and sulfated magnesium calcium facies and to distinguish two types of water which is in agreement with the findings of the hydrochemical maps and the geology of the zone the projection of the different parameters in the f1 f2 factorial plane shows us that mineralization is 51 06 related to anthropogenic activities agricultural and domestic activity infiltration of water is 15 58 due to water rock interaction mechanisms the affinity between the main source electrical conductivity of mineralization is very well correlated with na ca2 mg2 k cl from the water rock interaction and a lesser correlation with nh4 in addition there is a variation in the opposite direction of the no3 and po4 3 ions as regards the climate a follow up of its evolution over nine years reveals an intensification of precipitation and a constant evolution of temperatures any variability in the chemical elements in the short and long term will not have any impact on its quality due to the presence of undesirable elements in the trace however the impact of the climatic fluctuations could introduce in our waters heavy metals thus damaging the quality as a result we suggest the need to think about putting in place a real water policy this policy would enable the development and renewal of the sector in order to avoid over exploitation mainly through illicit levies appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia

12164,in view of higher pollution strength of indian rivers prevalent water quality indices of the western countries like the national sanitation foundation water quality index nsfwqi and indigenous vedprakash water quality index vwqi cannot truly represent the water quality status of indian rivers to overcome this limitation fuzzy modeling has been used in this study for the prediction of water quality of indian rivers the fuzzy models have been developed using triangular and trapezoidal membership functions with centroid bisector and mean of maxima mom methods for defuzzification it is observed that the fuzzy model with triangular membership function utilizing the bisector method of defuzzification performs better compared to triangular and trapezoidal membership function utilizing the centroid and mom method of defuzzification the values of water quality index based on fuzzy logic have been compared with the nsfwqi and vwqi it is observed that the values of fuzzy based water quality index are more representative to actual river water quality status of indian rivers as compared to nsfwqi and vwqi this is due to the fact that the adopted fuzzy logic approach is equally sensitive to all parameters and can truly represent the minor change in the value of any parameter especially in case of river stretches having higher pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords

wqi is a single dimensionless term by which the water quality of a stream can be expressed as good medium or bad the water quality of different regions can easily be compared by comparing the values of wqi instead of comparing the numerical values of several water quality parameters to evolve a wqi four steps have been utilised in the past abbasi and abbasi 2011 i choice of parameters ii determination of values of sub index iii ascertaining appropriate weights iv establishing the final index after compounding the sub indices while establishing a wqi the selection of water quality parameters is done based on a referring the work of previous researchers said et al 2004 b availability of the data sets cude 2001 c true representation of the quality scenario hanh et al 2011 d the proposed use of stream for a specific purpose hurley et al 2012 the subsequent step is the development of sub indices which is done to convert the selected parameters onto a common platform since the units of all the selected parameters cannot be same the subsequent step is establishing weights to the parameters equal or unequal weights have been assigned to the parameters by the index developers as per their judgment some researchers claimed that all parameters are equally important and assigned equal weights to all the parameters during the development of wqis e g cude 2001 ccme 2001 the index may suffer from sensitivity issue if the different weights are assigned to the parameters equation of the final index is decided on aggregation of sub indices and considering the weights assigned to the different parameters additive and multiplicative methods have been used for aggregation of sub indices most of the existing wqis have used additive method e g brown et al 1970 sargaonkar and deshpande 2003 but the additive method suffers from eclipsing issue swamee and tyagi 2007 while some other researchers used multiplicative method for the development of the wqis e g bhargava 1985 it was reported that the multiplicative approach can not completely resolve the eclipsing problem and also leads to ambiguity issue sometimes swamee and tyagi 2007 nsfwqi was developed by brown et al 1970 and is used worldwide including the indian subcontinent to determine the water quality of the rivers sutadian and yilmaz 2016 considering the present scenario of indian rivers this index can no longer be used in the indian subcontinent because most of the indian rivers carry high pollution potential in the form of high bod5 and total solids content the use of nsfwqi becomes deficient in such cases since its q value curves do not take into consideration high bod5 and total solids content of natural streams nayak et al 2017 godavari river is one of the sacred river of india and kumbhmela is celebrated on the banks of the godavari in and around nashik every twelve years thousands of people take a holy dip in godavari during kumbh and other festivals hence it is the need of the hour to determine water quality of this river in and around nashik in view of the limitations of the prevalent wqis viz eclipsing ambiguity and inability to be representative on downstream side of a wastewater treatment plant it is observed that these existing wqis cannot represent the actual picture of water quality status of indian rivers like godavari in the present study an attempt has been made to utilise fuzzy logic approach to develop fuzzy inference system to overcome the limitations of existing wqi approaches and for the identification of actual river water quality status especially in such indian scenario fuzzy logic approach has its inherent merits of flexibility and capability to deal with vagueness and uncertainty more effectively this approach also effectively addresses to sensitivity and ambiguity issues encountered in the determination of wqis in the present study suitability of godavari river water have been investigated for drinking purpose and outdoor bathing purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the godavari one of the biggest river in india emerges from brahmagiri mountain at 19 560n 73 200e is situated at triambakeswar in nashik district of maharashtra state fig 1 chavan et al 2009 the present study was carried out to assess the water quality of the godavari river in about 24 km stretch in and around nashik city in the present study fourteen river water quality sampling stations from the gangapur dam to dasak village were selected the sampling stations are marked as s1 to s14 in fig 2 the water samples for analysis were collected once in a month for 4 years at a point 30 cm below the water surface analysis of all the parameters was performed using standard methods apha 2012 intense reconnaissance survey work was done to identify the point and nonpoint sources of wastewater addition in a selected stretch of the godavari river and on that basis fig 2 has been developed during the survey work it was observed that partially treated or untreated sewage is getting added in the selected stretch of the godavari river these are the main point sources of pollution and are marked as p1 to p12 presented in fig 2 2 2 national sanitation foundation water quality index nsfwqi in the present study one of the most extensively used index in the entire world national sanitation foundation water quality index nsfwqi developed by brown et al 1970 has been used to find wqi for surface water sutadian and yilmaz 2016 bhutiani et al 2014 basin 2001 1 nsfwqi w i q i where wi weightage of the concerned parameter qi q value of the concerned parameter based on observed value determined from concerned graph for calculation of nsfwqi five parameters excluding faecal coliform temperature change phosphates and nitrates have been considered in the present study the selection of parameters was done by using delphi method the weightages of the parameters and water quality class for nsfwqi are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively and considered that the same are also applicable for the present study 2 3 vedprakash water quality index vwqi vedprakash wqi vwqi is the other most commonly used wqi for determination of water quality of surface water bodies in indian subcontinent bhutiani et al 2014 water quality report mpcb 2015 vedprakash 1990 developed the index on observing the fact that in routine water quality analysis work only a few numbers of important parameters viz do bod ph should be considered to ascertain the real water quality status of the streams in the indian subcontinent the list of parameters was selected using delphi this index was utilised to identify the stretches of river ganga where the difference between the required and the actual water quality is considerably high to indicate the need of pollution abatement initiatives the index is expressed in equation 2 here 2 vwqi i 1 p w i i i where w i is weightage of ith water quality parameter and i i is subindex for ith water quality parameter and p is the number of water quality parameters the index is inspired from the nsfwqi with little alteration in the weightages to affirm the water quality criteria for the uses of different categories subindex equations were used to determine the subindex values as presented in table 3 in the present study vedprakash water quality index vwqi has also been determined

the real conditions are often uncertain and zadeh 1965 defined this vagueness using the term fuzziness chau 2006 had used concept of fuzzy sets to carry out water quality modeling since it put forth a appropriate approach to deal with the issues where the goals and boundaries are not properly defined or imprecise nasiri et al 2007 developed a fuzzy river pollution decision support system to make expert knowledge available for nonexpert users bai and mohan 2009 studied water quality in the semenyih river malaysia with physico chemical parameters and commented that fuzzy water quality index will assist the decision makers in reporting the condition of water quality semiromi and hassani 2011 et al developed fuzzy water quality index for karoon river iran and identified that fuzzy logic approach have superior capabilities to deal with non linear complex and uncertain systems gharibi 2012 commented that fuzzy logic approach is a comprehensive tool for water quality assessment especially for the analysis of human drinking water patki 2015 used fuzzy inference system to assess the physicochemical parameters of municipal water under the distribution system to determine its portability li and zhihong 2016 developed fuzzy water pollution index method for water quality determination of qu river china and found that the method gives comprehensive water quality rank there are some predominant reasons which signify the merits of the models working on the concept of fuzzy logic the reasons are first issues involving nonlinear relationships among the variables can be addressed second local simple models have been utilised rendering them simple to work with third they can be communicated and understood verbally fourth individual expertise and experience is used which is not utilised by other methods lermontov et al 2009 gharibi 2009 2 4 2 fuzzy inference rules in fuzzy logic if then rules and fuzzy set operators are utilised to express the relationship between input and output variables of a system concepts of the formation of the fuzzy rules have been presented in table 6 2 4 3 basic structure of a fuzzy inference system fis a fuzzy inference system fis works on fuzzy set theory and incorporates the following four main steps ross 1977 a fuzzification in this step crisp values of the input parameters are converted into corresponding linguistic terms by making use of membership functions the adopted ranges of the different class for concerned parameters are used to find the value of membership function for different parameters for determination of the value of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions undermentioned equations are used triangular f x a b c 0 x a o r c x a x a b a x b c x c b b x c trapezoidal f x a b c 0 x a o r d x a x a b a x b 1 b x c d x d c c x d where a b c and d are membership function parameters and x represents each single point on the x axis b evaluation of the rules here compounding of the outcome of a fuzzy if then rule is done in this process the lowermost class of any of the selected parameter becomes the class of fuzzy index for that particular rule the lowermost class and corresponding value of membership function of any of the selected parameter becomes the class of the fuzzy index for the rule in this step applicable fuzzy rules for the given data are identified c aggregation of rule outputs in this step applicable fuzzy if then rules are considered the maximum value of the fuzzy index having the same class among the available applicable rules is considered outputs of all applicable rules are then clubbed into a single fuzzy distribution by carrying out the fuzzy union of applicable rules d defuzzification defuzzification is the conversion of the fuzzified output to the crisp value by using the methods of defuzzification 2 5 modeling performance criterions to ascertain the prediction accuracy of the fuzzy models developed in the present study two criterions have been utilised to assess the performance of the models the criterions utilised are mean square error mse and coefficient of correlation cc 2 5 1 mean square error mse the mean squared error mse of a particular case measures the average of the squared difference between the observed values and the predicted values the mse gives an indication of the error or residual variance 3 mse 1 n i 1 n observed predicted 2 2 5 2 coefficient of correlation the coefficient of correlation is an indication of the linear relationship between the two considered variables as presented here 4 c c i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 where n number of data in the dependent data set xi the observed values yi the predicted values x mean of the observed values and y mean of the predicted values patki 2015 and tiri and belkhiri 2018 used mean square error and coefficient of correlation as modeling performance criteria to assess the performance of the models 2 6 development of a water quality index based on fuzzy logic approach in the present study to investigate the water quality of the godavari river fuzzy logic approach with five main parameters namely do bod turbidity total solids and ph have been used in the present study comparison of river water quality using nsfwqi vqwi and fuzzy water quality index i e fqwi based on different membership functions involving different methods of defuzzification have been done to keep a common basis for ascertaining the value of the indices five representative and important water quality parameters named do bod turbidity total solids and ph have been considered it was also considered that the number of fuzzy rules increases exponentially with an increase in the number of parameters so considering only important parameters helps in reducing the number of fuzzy rules five types of class of water quality as excellent good medium bad and very bad have been selected for both the indices viz nsfwqi and fwqi in this study the mamdani approach has been utilised for development of the fuzzy inference system to determine the fwqi the process flow diagram for fuzzy inference system is as shown in fig 3 the limits of the classes for the considered water quality parameters for the development of fwqi have been presented as per tables 4 and 5 respectively for development of fwqi five input parameters have been utilised each input parameter has been classified into five water quality classes as very bad bad medium good and excellent as there are five water quality parameters with five classes the number of fuzzy rules would be 3125 i e 55 total 3125 rules were used to develop fuzzy inference system some of the sample fuzzy rules are presented in table 6 the mamdani approach has been used due to its simple structure and max min inference the implication method used was min and the aggregation method used was max the matlab 2014 toolbox was used for modeling the fuzzy inference system trapezoidal and triangular membership functions have been used for the development of fuzzy inference system water quality data of all fourteen stations for three years from 2013 to 2015 have been used for training while data of one year viz 2016 has been utilised for testing of the fis the study was carried out by considering triangular and trapezoidal membership function i e for each of the input and output parameters the defuzzification was carried out by using centroid mean of maxima mom and bisector methods the triangular mf for each input and output parameter is shown in fig 4 3 results and discussions in the present study water quality analysis has been done for four years from 2013 to 2016 and for illustration purpose water quality data at station two three four five thirteen and fourteen have been presented in figs 5 7 in figs 5 7 four water quality indices have been presented viz vwqi nsfwqi two no of fwqi based on triangular trapezoidal membership functions respectively vedprakash wqi i e vwqi is developed in india and mainly inspired by nsfwqi therefore there is a close correlation between the values of vwqi nsfwqi in india nsfwqi has been used both by central and various state pollution control boards so the values of fwqi have been compared with nsfwqi by identifying cc at various sampling stations in the subsequent deliberation fqwi based on triangular trapezoidal membership functions has been referred as fqwi triangular fqwi trapezoidal respectively in the present study for the development of fis both triangular and trapezoidal membership functions have been adopted using centroid bisector and mean of maxima i e mom as methods of defuzzification the triangular membership functions used have been presented in fig 4 the ranges for input and output parameters for triangular and trapezoidal mf are mentioned in table 4 and table 5 these ranges have been used to ascertain the water quality at different sampling stations in a selected stretch of godavari river as fuzzy water quality index fwqi fwqis using triangular and trapezoidal mf have been used as fwqi triangular and fwqi trapezoidal in the subsequent discussion the nsfwqi and fwqi values have been taken as observed and predicted values respectively modeling performance criteria in the form of mean square error i e mse and coefficient of correlation i e cc have been used for validation of predicted fwqis in table 9 error analysis during training and testing of fuzzy models for selected sampling stations has been mentioned it is evident from table 10 that a change in the model s performance occurs on changing the membership function and defuzzification method the best fitting model for each sampling station has been selected based on the value of cc between the observed and predicted values the performance of the model improves with the increase in the value of cc the model having the highest value of cc during the testing shows a better correlation between the observed and predicted values of wqis and therefore selected as best fitting model but if the value of cc is same for two or more models then the model having the lesser value of mse is selected as best fitting model the best fitting models for each sampling station has been presented in table 10 it can be readily perceived from tables 9 and 10 that the performance of models with triangular mf using the bisector method of defuzzification is better as compared to the triangular and trapezoidal mf employing other methods of defuzzification it can also be observed from table 10 that out of fourteen sampling stations in the study area triangular mf performs better for thirteen stations as compared to trapezoidal mf while trapezoidal mf performs better for one station only it is evident from table 10 that the bisector method of defuzzification performs better for nine sampling stations while centroid and mean of maxima method performs better for three and two stations respectively the value of cc at sampling stations 11 to 14 is relatively less since the valve of bod5 and total solids at these stations is more than 30 mg l and 500 mg l respectively due to which significant reduction in value of fwqi occurs while nsfwqi and vwqi values are relatively more as compared to fwqi values this significant difference in the values of fwqi as compared to values of nsfwqi and vwqi is due to the limitations of nsfwqi and vwqi the limitations of nsfwqi and vwqi are that they cannot truly represent water quality when bod5 and total solids are more than 30 mg l and 500 mg l respectively nayak et al 2016 therefore the actual water quality cannot be truly reflected by nsfwqi vwqi under these cases due to their limitation of eclipsing caused on account of their aggregation function additive in nature whereas at these stations actual water quality status can be truly represented by fwqi since the fuzzy approach is equally sensitive to a minor change in the value of each parameter it is observed from figs 5 7 that fwqi triangular and fwqi trapezoidal values are on the relatively lower side as compared to nsfwqi and vwqi values this is because fwqi approach gives equal weightage to each parameter when the value of even a single parameter is in the bad category like bod5 is more than 500 mg l then fwqi approach considers that the water quality is bad even when the remaining parameters are in good category this change in water class is not truly reflected by nsfwqi and vwqi approach due to their limitation of eclipsing it is evident from figs 5 7 that during the summer season in all years except 2015 a significant reduction in wqi values occurs which is effectively reflected by fwqi triangular approach and has not been depicted by nsfwqi and vwqi approaches due to their inherent limitation kumbhmela was organized during 2015 on the banks of godavari at nashik so waste water was not allowed to be entered into the godavari before the prominent bathing ghats at nashik therefore in summer 2015 a significant difference between fwqi and other wqi values is not visible it can be readily observed from figs 5 7 that the performance of fwqi triangular is more representative to exhibit true water quality status as compared to fwqi trapezoidal this is due to the observation that appropriate variation in the values of fwqi trapezoidal is not reflected like fwqi triangular this is due to the flat shape of trapezoidal mf in the central portion which makes it relatively less representative as compared to triangular mf as evident from table 10 that fwqi triangular model using the bisector defuzzification method outperforms other considered fwqi models of the study it has been observed from the study that from the gangapur dam to the someshwar temple only the godavari river is cpcb class a river and fit to serve as drinking water after disinfection only based on study tables 7 and 8 it is found that godavari is cpcb class c river from anandwalli bridge to ghatgebaba bridge while from tapovan stp to dasak bridge godavari is cpcb class d river it can be understood from the above deliberation that actual water quality status can not be truly represented by nsfwqi vwqi approach at places where pollution level increases beyond a certain limit therefore a more rational approach like fuzzy logic approach is required to represent the true picture of the actual water quality status of the indian rivers carrying high pollutional loads 4 conclusions the study for identification of water quality status of the godavari river at nashik was carried out by using the most prevalent nsfwqi and indigenous vwqi it is evident that both nsfwqi and vwqi exhibits similar results and are in close correlation but both indices suffer from

12164,in view of higher pollution strength of indian rivers prevalent water quality indices of the western countries like the national sanitation foundation water quality index nsfwqi and indigenous vedprakash water quality index vwqi cannot truly represent the water quality status of indian rivers to overcome this limitation fuzzy modeling has been used in this study for the prediction of water quality of indian rivers the fuzzy models have been developed using triangular and trapezoidal membership functions with centroid bisector and mean of maxima mom methods for defuzzification it is observed that the fuzzy model with triangular membership function utilizing the bisector method of defuzzification performs better compared to triangular and trapezoidal membership function utilizing the centroid and mom method of defuzzification the values of water quality index based on fuzzy logic have been compared with the nsfwqi and vwqi it is observed that the values of fuzzy based water quality index are more representative to actual river water quality status of indian rivers as compared to nsfwqi and vwqi this is due to the fact that the adopted fuzzy logic approach is equally sensitive to all parameters and can truly represent the minor change in the value of any parameter especially in case of river stretches having higher pollution graphical abstract image 1 keywords

wqi is a single dimensionless term by which the water quality of a stream can be expressed as good medium or bad the water quality of different regions can easily be compared by comparing the values of wqi instead of comparing the numerical values of several water quality parameters to evolve a wqi four steps have been utilised in the past abbasi and abbasi 2011 i choice of parameters ii determination of values of sub index iii ascertaining appropriate weights iv establishing the final index after compounding the sub indices while establishing a wqi the selection of water quality parameters is done based on a referring the work of previous researchers said et al 2004 b availability of the data sets cude 2001 c true representation of the quality scenario hanh et al 2011 d the proposed use of stream for a specific purpose hurley et al 2012 the subsequent step is the development of sub indices which is done to convert the selected parameters onto a common platform since the units of all the selected parameters cannot be same the subsequent step is establishing weights to the parameters equal or unequal weights have been assigned to the parameters by the index developers as per their judgment some researchers claimed that all parameters are equally important and assigned equal weights to all the parameters during the development of wqis e g cude 2001 ccme 2001 the index may suffer from sensitivity issue if the different weights are assigned to the parameters equation of the final index is decided on aggregation of sub indices and considering the weights assigned to the different parameters additive and multiplicative methods have been used for aggregation of sub indices most of the existing wqis have used additive method e g brown et al 1970 sargaonkar and deshpande 2003 but the additive method suffers from eclipsing issue swamee and tyagi 2007 while some other researchers used multiplicative method for the development of the wqis e g bhargava 1985 it was reported that the multiplicative approach can not completely resolve the eclipsing problem and also leads to ambiguity issue sometimes swamee and tyagi 2007 nsfwqi was developed by brown et al 1970 and is used worldwide including the indian subcontinent to determine the water quality of the rivers sutadian and yilmaz 2016 considering the present scenario of indian rivers this index can no longer be used in the indian subcontinent because most of the indian rivers carry high pollution potential in the form of high bod5 and total solids content the use of nsfwqi becomes deficient in such cases since its q value curves do not take into consideration high bod5 and total solids content of natural streams nayak et al 2017 godavari river is one of the sacred river of india and kumbhmela is celebrated on the banks of the godavari in and around nashik every twelve years thousands of people take a holy dip in godavari during kumbh and other festivals hence it is the need of the hour to determine water quality of this river in and around nashik in view of the limitations of the prevalent wqis viz eclipsing ambiguity and inability to be representative on downstream side of a wastewater treatment plant it is observed that these existing wqis cannot represent the actual picture of water quality status of indian rivers like godavari in the present study an attempt has been made to utilise fuzzy logic approach to develop fuzzy inference system to overcome the limitations of existing wqi approaches and for the identification of actual river water quality status especially in such indian scenario fuzzy logic approach has its inherent merits of flexibility and capability to deal with vagueness and uncertainty more effectively this approach also effectively addresses to sensitivity and ambiguity issues encountered in the determination of wqis in the present study suitability of godavari river water have been investigated for drinking purpose and outdoor bathing purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the godavari one of the biggest river in india emerges from brahmagiri mountain at 19 560n 73 200e is situated at triambakeswar in nashik district of maharashtra state fig 1 chavan et al 2009 the present study was carried out to assess the water quality of the godavari river in about 24 km stretch in and around nashik city in the present study fourteen river water quality sampling stations from the gangapur dam to dasak village were selected the sampling stations are marked as s1 to s14 in fig 2 the water samples for analysis were collected once in a month for 4 years at a point 30 cm below the water surface analysis of all the parameters was performed using standard methods apha 2012 intense reconnaissance survey work was done to identify the point and nonpoint sources of wastewater addition in a selected stretch of the godavari river and on that basis fig 2 has been developed during the survey work it was observed that partially treated or untreated sewage is getting added in the selected stretch of the godavari river these are the main point sources of pollution and are marked as p1 to p12 presented in fig 2 2 2 national sanitation foundation water quality index nsfwqi in the present study one of the most extensively used index in the entire world national sanitation foundation water quality index nsfwqi developed by brown et al 1970 has been used to find wqi for surface water sutadian and yilmaz 2016 bhutiani et al 2014 basin 2001 1 nsfwqi w i q i where wi weightage of the concerned parameter qi q value of the concerned parameter based on observed value determined from concerned graph for calculation of nsfwqi five parameters excluding faecal coliform temperature change phosphates and nitrates have been considered in the present study the selection of parameters was done by using delphi method the weightages of the parameters and water quality class for nsfwqi are presented in tables 1 and 2 respectively and considered that the same are also applicable for the present study 2 3 vedprakash water quality index vwqi vedprakash wqi vwqi is the other most commonly used wqi for determination of water quality of surface water bodies in indian subcontinent bhutiani et al 2014 water quality report mpcb 2015 vedprakash 1990 developed the index on observing the fact that in routine water quality analysis work only a few numbers of important parameters viz do bod ph should be considered to ascertain the real water quality status of the streams in the indian subcontinent the list of parameters was selected using delphi this index was utilised to identify the stretches of river ganga where the difference between the required and the actual water quality is considerably high to indicate the need of pollution abatement initiatives the index is expressed in equation 2 here 2 vwqi i 1 p w i i i where w i is weightage of ith water quality parameter and i i is subindex for ith water quality parameter and p is the number of water quality parameters the index is inspired from the nsfwqi with little alteration in the weightages to affirm the water quality criteria for the uses of different categories subindex equations were used to determine the subindex values as presented in table 3 in the present study vedprakash water quality index vwqi has also been determined weightages w i of parameters do 0 43 bod 0 26 ph 0 31 2 4 fuzzy logic system 2 4 1 fuzzy inference system fuzzy inference system is resulted on combining the fuzzy logic with expert system zadeh 1965 the real conditions are often uncertain and zadeh 1965 defined this vagueness using the term fuzziness chau 2006 had used concept of fuzzy sets to carry out water quality modeling since it put forth a appropriate approach to deal with the issues where the goals and boundaries are not properly defined or imprecise nasiri et al 2007 developed a fuzzy river pollution decision support system to make expert knowledge available for nonexpert users bai and mohan 2009 studied water quality in the semenyih river malaysia with physico chemical parameters and commented that fuzzy water quality index will assist the decision makers in reporting the condition of water quality semiromi and hassani 2011 et al developed fuzzy water quality index for karoon river iran and identified that fuzzy logic approach have superior capabilities to deal with non linear complex and uncertain systems gharibi 2012 commented that fuzzy logic approach is a comprehensive tool for water quality assessment especially for the analysis of human drinking water patki 2015 used fuzzy inference system to assess the physicochemical parameters of municipal water under the distribution system to determine its portability li and zhihong 2016 developed fuzzy water pollution index method for water quality determination of qu river china and found that the method gives comprehensive water quality rank there are some predominant reasons which signify the merits of the models working on the concept of fuzzy logic the reasons are first issues involving nonlinear relationships among the variables can be addressed second local simple models have been utilised rendering them simple to work with third they can be communicated and understood verbally fourth individual expertise and experience is used which is not utilised by other methods lermontov et al 2009 gharibi 2009 2 4 2 fuzzy inference rules in fuzzy logic if then rules and fuzzy set operators are utilised to express the relationship between input and output variables of a system concepts of the formation of the fuzzy rules have been presented in table 6 2 4 3 basic structure of a fuzzy inference system fis a fuzzy inference system fis works on fuzzy set theory and incorporates the following four main steps ross 1977 a fuzzification in this step crisp values of the input parameters are converted into corresponding linguistic terms by making use of membership functions the adopted ranges of the different class for concerned parameters are used to find the value of membership function for different parameters for determination of the value of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions undermentioned equations are used triangular f x a b c 0 x a o r c x a x a b a x b c x c b b x c trapezoidal f x a b c 0 x a o r d x a x a b a x b 1 b x c d x d c c x d where a b c and d are membership function parameters and x represents each single point on the x axis b evaluation of the rules here compounding of the outcome of a fuzzy if then rule is done in this process the lowermost class of any of the selected parameter becomes the class of fuzzy index for that particular rule the lowermost class and corresponding value of membership function of any of the selected parameter becomes the class of the fuzzy index for the rule in this step applicable fuzzy rules for the given data are identified c aggregation of rule outputs in this step applicable fuzzy if then rules are considered the maximum value of the fuzzy index having the same class among the available applicable rules is considered outputs of all applicable rules are then clubbed into a single fuzzy distribution by carrying out the fuzzy union of applicable rules d defuzzification defuzzification is the conversion of the fuzzified output to the crisp value by using the methods of defuzzification 2 5 modeling performance criterions to ascertain the prediction accuracy of the fuzzy models developed in the present study two criterions have been utilised to assess the performance of the models the criterions utilised are mean square error mse and coefficient of correlation cc 2 5 1 mean square error mse the mean squared error mse of a particular case measures the average of the squared difference between the observed values and the predicted values the mse gives an indication of the error or residual variance 3 mse 1 n i 1 n observed predicted 2 2 5 2 coefficient of correlation the coefficient of correlation is an indication of the linear relationship between the two considered variables as presented here 4 c c i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 y i y 2 where n number of data in the dependent data set xi the observed values yi the predicted values x mean of the observed values and y mean of the predicted values patki 2015 and tiri and belkhiri 2018 used mean square error and coefficient of correlation as modeling performance criteria to assess the performance of the models 2 6 development of a water quality index based on fuzzy logic approach in the present study to investigate the water quality of the godavari river fuzzy logic approach with five main parameters namely do bod turbidity total solids and ph have been used in the present study comparison of river water quality using nsfwqi vqwi and fuzzy water quality index i e fqwi based on different membership functions involving different methods of defuzzification have been done to keep a common basis for ascertaining the value of the indices five representative and important water quality parameters named do bod turbidity total solids and ph have been considered it was also considered that the number of fuzzy rules increases exponentially with an increase in the number of parameters so considering only important parameters helps in reducing the number of fuzzy rules five types of class of water quality as excellent good medium bad and very bad have been selected for both the indices viz nsfwqi and fwqi in this study the mamdani approach has been utilised for development of the fuzzy inference system to determine the fwqi the process flow diagram for fuzzy inference system is as shown in fig 3 the limits of the classes for the considered water quality parameters for the development of fwqi have been presented as per tables 4 and 5 respectively for development of fwqi five input parameters have been utilised each input parameter has been classified into five water quality classes as very bad bad medium good and excellent as there are five water quality parameters with five classes the number of fuzzy rules would be 3125 i e 55 total 3125 rules were used to develop fuzzy inference system some of the sample fuzzy rules are presented in table 6 the mamdani approach has been used due to its simple structure and max min inference the implication method used was min and the aggregation method used was max the matlab 2014 toolbox was used for modeling the fuzzy inference system trapezoidal and triangular membership functions have been used for the development of fuzzy inference system water quality data of all fourteen stations for three years from 2013 to 2015 have been used for training while data of one year viz 2016 has been utilised for testing of the fis the study was carried out by considering triangular and trapezoidal membership function i e for each of the input and output parameters the defuzzification was carried out by using centroid mean of maxima mom and bisector methods the triangular mf for each input and output parameter is shown in fig 4 3 results and discussions in the present study water quality analysis has been done for four years from 2013 to 2016 and for illustration purpose water quality data at station two three four five thirteen and fourteen have been presented in figs 5 7 in figs 5 7 four water quality indices have been presented viz vwqi nsfwqi two no of fwqi based on triangular trapezoidal membership functions respectively vedprakash wqi i e vwqi is developed in india and mainly inspired by nsfwqi therefore there is a close correlation between the values of vwqi nsfwqi in india nsfwqi has been used both by central and various state pollution control boards so the values of fwqi have been compared with nsfwqi by identifying cc at various sampling stations in the subsequent deliberation fqwi based on triangular trapezoidal membership functions has been referred as fqwi triangular fqwi trapezoidal respectively in the present study for the development of fis both triangular and trapezoidal membership functions have been adopted using centroid bisector and mean of maxima i e mom as methods of defuzzification the triangular membership functions used have been presented in fig 4 the ranges for input and output parameters for triangular and trapezoidal mf are mentioned in table 4 and table 5 these ranges have been used to ascertain the water quality at different sampling stations in a selected stretch of godavari river as fuzzy water quality index fwqi fwqis using triangular and trapezoidal mf have been used as fwqi triangular and fwqi trapezoidal in the subsequent discussion the nsfwqi and fwqi values have been taken as observed and predicted values respectively modeling performance criteria in the form of mean square error i e mse and coefficient of correlation i e cc have been used for validation of predicted fwqis in table 9 error analysis during training and testing of fuzzy models for selected sampling stations has been mentioned it is evident from table 10 that a change in the model s performance occurs on changing the membership function and defuzzification method the best fitting model for each sampling station has been selected based on the value of cc between the observed and predicted values the performance of the model improves with the increase in the value of cc the model having the highest value of cc during the testing shows a better correlation between the observed and predicted values of wqis and therefore selected as best fitting model but if the value of cc is same for two or more models then the model having the lesser value of mse is selected as best fitting model the best fitting models for each sampling station has been presented in table 10 it can be readily perceived from tables 9 and 10 that the performance of models with triangular mf using the bisector method of defuzzification is better as compared to the triangular and trapezoidal mf employing other methods of defuzzification it can also be observed from table 10 that out of fourteen sampling stations in the study area triangular mf performs better for thirteen stations as compared to trapezoidal mf while trapezoidal mf performs better for one station only it is evident from table 10 that the bisector method of defuzzification performs better for nine sampling stations while centroid and mean of maxima method performs better for three and two stations respectively the value of cc at sampling stations 11 to 14 is relatively less since the valve of bod5 and total solids at these stations is more than 30 mg l and 500 mg l respectively due to which significant reduction in value of fwqi occurs while nsfwqi and vwqi values are relatively more as compared to fwqi values this significant difference in the values of fwqi as compared to values of nsfwqi and vwqi is due to the limitations of nsfwqi and vwqi the limitations of nsfwqi and vwqi are that they cannot truly represent water quality when bod5 and total solids are more than 30 mg l and 500 mg l respectively nayak et al 2016 therefore the actual water quality cannot be truly reflected by nsfwqi vwqi under these cases due to their limitation of eclipsing caused on account of their aggregation function additive in nature whereas at these stations actual water quality status can be truly represented by fwqi since the fuzzy approach is equally sensitive to a minor change in the value of each parameter it is observed from figs 5 7 that fwqi triangular and fwqi trapezoidal values are on the relatively lower side as compared to nsfwqi and vwqi values this is because fwqi approach gives equal weightage to each parameter when the value of even a single parameter is in the bad category like bod5 is more than 500 mg l then fwqi approach considers that the water quality is bad even when the remaining parameters are in good category this change in water class is not truly reflected by nsfwqi and vwqi approach due to their limitation of eclipsing it is evident from figs 5 7 that during the summer season in all years except 2015 a significant reduction in wqi values occurs which is effectively reflected by fwqi triangular approach and has not been depicted by nsfwqi and vwqi approaches due to their inherent limitation kumbhmela was organized during 2015 on the banks of godavari at nashik so waste water was not allowed to be entered into the godavari before the prominent bathing ghats at nashik therefore in summer 2015 a significant difference between fwqi and other wqi values is not visible it can be readily observed from figs 5 7 that the performance of fwqi triangular is more representative to exhibit true water quality status as compared to fwqi trapezoidal this is due to the observation that appropriate variation in the values of fwqi trapezoidal is not reflected like fwqi triangular this is due to the flat shape of trapezoidal mf in the central portion which makes it relatively less representative as compared to triangular mf as evident from table 10 that fwqi triangular model using the bisector defuzzification method outperforms other considered fwqi models of the study it has been observed from the study that from the gangapur dam to the someshwar temple only the godavari river is cpcb class a river and fit to serve as drinking water after disinfection only based on study tables 7 and 8 it is found that godavari is cpcb class c river from anandwalli bridge to ghatgebaba bridge while from tapovan stp to dasak bridge godavari is cpcb class d river it can be understood from the above deliberation that actual water quality status can not be truly represented by nsfwqi vwqi approach at places where pollution level increases beyond a certain limit therefore a more rational approach like fuzzy logic approach is required to represent the true picture of the actual water quality status of the indian rivers carrying high pollutional loads 4 conclusions the study for identification of water quality status of the godavari river at nashik was carried out by using the most prevalent nsfwqi and indigenous vwqi it is evident that both nsfwqi and vwqi exhibits similar results and are in close correlation but both indices suffer from eclipsing and can not truly represent the high concentration of parameters like bod5 and total solids therefore these indices become insensitive towards these parameters to overcome the limitations of these two indices a more rational fuzzy logic approach has been adopted the fuzzy models have been developed using triangular and trapezoidal membership functions with centroid bisector and mean of maxima mom methods for defuzzification the study revealed that 1 fuzzy logic approach is equally sensitive to all parameters and provides flexibility to choose the range of different parameters and corresponding quality class as per expert s judgement 2 fuzzy logic approach is more sensitive for little change in the value of each parameter and takes cognizance of the water quality minutely 3 fuzzy logic approach can truly represent the water quality status in the cases of very high pollution of streams observed in the indian scenario which cannot be depicted by nsfwqi and vwqi approach 4 the performance of the fuzzy model changes considerably on changing the membership function and defuzzification method 5 the fuzzy models with triangular mf and bisector method of defuzzification outperforms other fuzzy models for indian streams 6 the fwqi index developed by the present study produces reliable and accurate results therefore its use should be preferred by the municipal corporations for assessment of surface water quality especially when assessing water for human consumption or use by mankind is under consideration acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the
