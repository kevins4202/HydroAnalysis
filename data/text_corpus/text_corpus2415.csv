pradesh india corresponding author the energy and resources institute darbari seth block ihc complex new delhi 110003 india the energy and resources institute darbari seth block ihc complex new delhi 110003 india uddanam region in srikakulam district of andhra pradesh india is a chronic kidney disease ckd hotspot with high prevalence of ckd of unknown etiology ckdu several investigators have suggested that groundwater contamination could be one of the factors contributing to the high prevalence of ckdu in this region this study focused on the monitoring and assessment of groundwater quality of uddanam with a major objective of identifying etiological factors of ckdu linked to drinking water composite groundwater sampling was carried out in 40 selected villages in uddanam and 100 villages of other nine districts in andhra pradesh during august 2018 may 2019 about 35 of villages in the study area had acidic groundwater ph 6 5 while only 3 villages in other districts had acidic groundwater moreover groundwater had elevated silica sio2 concentration 45 mg l during the monsoon wet season while high lead pb concentration 0 023 mg l was measured during pre monsoon dry season the lead concentration in the groundwater samples were found to be above the bureau of indian standards bis permissible limit 0 01 mg l in 55 of villages during dry season as compared to 10 during wet season fluoride f concentration in groundwater was found well below the bis permissible limit 1 5 mg l in 95 of villages of study area with mean concentration 0 54 mg l sd 0 40 synergic effects on kidney function of lead fluoride silica and water hardness in acidic water need to be explored in this study analysis of organic contaminants such as pesticides and phthalates in groundwater samples of the study area were also carried out pesticides were not found in any groundwater samples however phthalates were detected in all water samples groundwater treated with reverse osmosis ro process is recommended for drinking and cooking as a preventive measure for ckdu in uddanam graphical abstract image 1 keywords chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu drinking water fluoride heavy metals phthalates silica 1 introduction chronic kidney disease ckd in which kidney function slows down as the disease progresses leading to end stage kidney disease eskd and death if not treated with kidney replacement therapy has emerged as an important public health issue across the globe among all fatal diseases in india ckd is ranked eighth by the global burden of disease study jha and modi 2017 the million deaths study 2001 2013 report revealed that ckd related death rate in india doubled over a 10 year period in the 21st century particularly in the southern and eastern states of india dare et al 2017 diabetes and long standing hypertension are most frequent causes of ckd however the cause of kidney disease cannot be identified in a significant proportion of cases such cases have been dubbed ckd of uncertain etiology ckdu clustering of such cases has been reported from certain geographies such as uddanam region of srikakulam andhra pradesh india ganguli 2016 the local communities consider environmental factors such as impurities in drinking water to be responsible for the high burden of ckd however conclusive scientific evidence is yet to be established groundwater is the prime source of drinking and cooking purposes for the population living in the uddanam limited information is available about the quality of ground water in uddanam region reddy and gunasekar 2013 performed the groundwater quality monitoring of uddanam region and chimakurthy mandal another ckd hotspot in andhra pradesh with focus on inorganic constituents in water one time grab sampling was carried out during the dry season june 2011 and 34 groundwater water samples were collected from the bore wells hand pumps dug wells and public water supply stations located in kaviti palasa sompeta and vajrapukotturu mandals administrative divisions within a district of andhra pradesh of uddanam about 21 of the groundwater samples had ph below 6 5 18 samples were reported with total dissolved solids tds and nitrate above the recommended bureau of indian standards bis limit of 500 mg l and 45 mg l respectively the maximum fluoride concentration in water samples measured was 0 5 mg l silica and trace metals level were tested in 41 groundwater samples in which maximum silica concentration of 0 25 mg l was measured while 20 samples showed aluminum concentration above 0 2 mg l and 24 with iron concentration above the normal value 0 3 mg l trace heavy metals such as chromium lead and cadmium concentration ranges were 7 3 64 3 μg l 0 2 38 9 μg l and 0 1 5 μg l respectively while metalloid selenium had concentration range of 0 7 12 1 μg l pesticides other organics and seasonal variation in the concentration of inorganic contaminants was not investigated reported the study concluded overall good groundwater quality of uddanam region however a significant number of samples 18 24 violated the bis drinking water standards for ph tds nitrate aluminum and iron moreover chromium lead and cadmium were found in trace concentration and these can be harmful to the kidney if such water is consumed for several years in heat stressed geographical regions like uddanam gharibi et al 2012 wasana et al 2017 in another study by satyanarayana et al 2017 51 groundwater samples were collected from uddanam region and analyzed for general water quality parameters including silica one time sampling activities was performed during wet monsoon season the ph and tds ranges were reported to be 6 1 9 and 71 3117 mg l respectively whereas nitrate and silica concentration ranges were 0 4 12 mg l and 38 268 mg l respectively parameters like tds sodium na potassium k total hardness th chloride cl and sulfate could explain 54 9 of total variation in groundwater quality and therefore have been assigned under the first four principle components while silica sio2 and dissolved oxygen do could explain only 12 5 of total variance fluoride f heavy metals and organics in groundwater samples were not measured multivariate and temporal analysis of groundwater quality parameters had been recommended 1 1 ckdu in sri lanka like uddanam ckdu cases in rural farmers of the north central province of sri lanka were first noticed during the nineties several hypotheses have been introduced to explain the ckdu etiology but no conclusive evidence has been identified so far however most of these hypotheses suspect groundwater contaminants as a possible etiology for ckdu cooray et al 2019 both inorganic and organic contaminants of groundwater have been analyzed to find out their relation with ckdu most of the researchers were attracted to the inorganic contaminants such as hardness fluoride silica and heavy metals e g cadmium arsenic lead etc in groundwater and thus have been exclusively studied rango et al 2015 dharma wardana et al 2015 wasana et al 2016 2017 weragoda and kawakami 2017 balasooriya et al 2019 wimalawansa 2014 2016 suggested ckd of multifactorial origin ckdmfo ckdu due to the combined effects of various environmental factors such as ions heavy metals fluoride and agrochemicals peiris and brikowski 2017 2019 studied the spatial and temporal variations in groundwater quality of ckdu affected north central province of sri lanka nephrotoxic heavy metals such as arsenic 0 89 0 61 μg l cadmium 0 06 0 11 μg l and lead 3 53 7 84 μg l were measured well below the regulatory limits however they showed noticeable temporal as well as spatial variations the wet monsoon and dry summer are two extreme weather events in this region which have resulted in extensive water level changes in the aquifers causing temporal variation in these heavy metal concentrations the ro treatment of groundwater was found effective in removing the hardness and some heavy metals particularly arsenic and cadmium however prolonged consumption ro water and disposal of ro reject might be a concern pinto et al 2020 conducted a survey based study in the dry zone of sri lanka to figure out the possible relationship between water quality and ckdu they have identified the ecohydrological factors such as inefficient use of fertilizers and weedicides responsible for the deterioration of water quality moreover high levels of geogenic fluoride and water hardness might have a complicated multifactorial association with ckdu chandrajith et al 2020 reviewed the levels of geogenic fluoride and arsenic as reported in several groundwater monitoring studies the mean concentration of f in groundwater particularly in the dry zone metamorphic aquifers have been reported above 1 mg l over 50 of wells by several researchers however the as concentration in groundwater in general has been reported below the 10 μg l thus these two pollutants needs greater attention considering the health hazard of f they have also suggested the introduction of suitable defluoridation methods at the household level makehelwala et al 2020 investigated the interactions of ca2 and so42 ions with dissolved organic carbon doc such as humic acid in groundwater in depth characterization of the doc extracted from groundwater revealed the complexation of ca2 with carboxylate and sulfonate groups on humic acid which is postulated as a uremic toxicant the research group emphasized the need of further research to elucidate the role of doc in uremic toxicant formation recently in sri lanka the efforts were made to find the link between environmental contaminants and ckdu using animal model perera et al 2020 studied the effects of high water hardness with high fluoride on kidney and liver in rats the high levels of hardness and f resulted in acute tubular injury with a significant increase in serum levels of creatinine urea and ast activity which could be minimized by administering distilled water earlier perera et al 2018 had also reported the alterations in liver enzyme activities at early stages of f intoxication followed by renal damage wasana et al 2017 investigated and found strong evidence of synergic effect among cadmium fluoride and hardness of water on kidney tissues of mice which could lead to severe kidney damage in mice even at who maximum recommended levels the present study was undertaken under the study to test operationalize preventive approaches stop for ckdu in ap stop ckdu ap grand challenges project of the government of andhra pradesh goap indian council of medical resarch with main aim to establish the root causes responsible for the high burden of ckd in uddanam this report covers the assessment of the groundwater quality this specific component of the stop ckdu ap study was designed to assess the groundwater quality in the uddanam region in srikakulam district during the wet monsoon and dry summer seasons to capture the temporal variability of critical parameters the organics i e pesticides and phthalates were also analyzed in groundwater samples of uddanam for the first time in our knowledge the groundwater samples from chimakurthy and nearby mandals of prakasam district other ckd region were also collected and analyzed to investigate the differences in water quality groundwater samples were collected from eight other districts non ckd region of andhra pradesh to explore the differences in groundwater quality across the state which were considered as control sites with respect to uddanam region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area uddanam region is the northeast extension coastal region of srikakulam district andhra pradesh india latitude 18 56219 19 16563 n longitude 84 30934 84 76844 e this region consists of the seven block level administrative boundaries mandal namely vajrapukothuru v kothuru palasa mandasa sompeta kanchili kaviti and ichchapuram and accounting for 118 villages census data 2011 the uddanam region has very pleasant greenery of cashew and coconut trees with laterite soils rich in iron and aluminum palasa is the main town of uddanam which is also known as white gold city as about 300 medium and small scale cashew processing units are located in hereof paddy oryza sativa is the major agricultural produce which is grown mainly in the monsoon season the study area i e uddanam region is shown in fig 1 the detailed information about the demography of the study area and selection criteria of villages for the present study has been described elsewhere john et al 2019 in this study 40 out of 118 villages of uddanam were selected using probability proportional to size pps sampling method for conducting the epidemiological survey the same villages were taken for groundwater sampling to correlate with epidemiological findings each village of the study area was designated a number tag 1 40 for convenience in identification and spatial positioning as shown in fig 1 except in chimakurthy mandal of prakasam district ckd cases in all other geographical regions of andhra pradesh were reported sporadically and therefore these sampling spots were taken as control sites due to similar environmental conditions however machilipatnam mandal of krishna district was envisaged as the most suited control site due to sufficient distance 550 km from uddanam and similar coastal environment 2 2 sampling and chemical analysis 2 2 1 sampling water samples were collected from the groundwater extraction sources such as dug well borewell and handpump as per the central pollution control boad cpcb protocol for water sampling cpcb 2017 for a typical water sample from a village 1 l grab samples were collected from multiple locations n 3 10 within the administrative boundary of that village the grab samples thus collected were mixed in equal proportions 1 1 to make a representative composite sample of that village the composite water sample was filtered using whatman filter paper grade 1 pore size 11 μm and 1 l filtered water was collected the volume of water was divided in two equal parts each 500 ml and collected in a narrow and wide mouth high density polyethylene hdpe bottle tarsons product pvt ltd kolkata india thus total forty composite groundwater samples in duplicate were collected from forty villages of the study area during both monsoon wet september october 2018 and pre monsoon dry may 2019 seasons the water samples targeted for metals heavy metals analysis were acidified with 1 ml l hno3 fisher scientific purity 69 70 at the collection site both acidified and non acidified water samples were stored at 4 c and transported to nabl accredited laboratories for analysis other sources of water in the uddanam region sampled included comprehensive piped water supply cpws rural water supply rws schemes and reverse osmosis ro treated water at ntr sujala mother plants in each of the seven mandals the source of these public water supply schemes cpws and rws is groundwater extracted from mahendratanya river bed while groundwater is extracted from infiltration borewell for ntr sujala ro water supply seven individual grab water samples were collected at sources of all these public water supply schemes running for uddanam in order to understand the differences between the water quality of uddanam region and rest of places in andhra pradesh groundwater samples were collected from 100 different villages streets located in other 9 districts namely vizianagram visakhapatnam east godavari west godavari guntur krishna prakasam nellore and kadapa as shown in fig 1b for pesticides and organics analyses composite groundwater samples used for drinking and cooking purposes were collected in 2 l amber color hdpe bottle tarsons kolkata india to prevent their deterioration from solar radiations and were transported to the analytical facility within 12 h of the sample collection nineteen groundwater samples from houses and six ro water samples total 25 from ntr sujala mother plants located in each mandal were collected and analyzed for pesticides and organics such as phthalates 2 2 2 analysis measurements of general water quality parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and temperature were done using portable water tester hi98130 ph ec tds temperature waterproof tester hanna instruments romania at the sampling sites fluoride in groundwater was measured onsite with fluoride checker hi 729 hanna romania hardness nitrate sulfate and phosphate concentration in groundwater collected in dry season were analyzed as per standard protocols is 3025 apha 2012 whereas silica concentration was measured by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method apha 2012 at simhadri lab visakhapatnam india metals and heavy metals were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms at noida testing laboratories noida india and spectro analytical labs limited bhubaneswar india the analytical results were verified at sadekar enviro engineers pvt ltd thane india and found within acceptable variation 3 the analysis of pesticides and unknown organics was started within 24 h of sample collection using gc ms ms instrument agilent technologies 7000 triple quadrupole ms ms at spectro analytical labs limited bhubaneswar india analysis of pesticides was performed according to the agilent 7000c msd method used for the analysis of residual pesticides in drinking water samples agilent technologies 2016 for the analysis of unknown organics in water samples a methodology developed by portolés et al 2011 was adopted the identification of unknown organic molecules was done with wiley and nist mass spectra libraries two water samples were collected in copper metal containers instead of hdpe plastic container to ensure that plastic container has not contributed phthalates itself to water samples being analyzed 2 3 geo spatial mapping and statistical analysis the longitude and latitude of the sampling locations were recorded using android mobile application my gps coordinates and the readings were verified with garmin gpsmap 64s handheld gps navigator the geographical data thus obtained was used for mapping with arcgis 10 5 software sas statistical software version 9 4 was used for data analysis and to investigate the correlation between water quality parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality parameters the general water quality parameters such as ph ec and tds were measured at the site of collection points during monsoon wet post monsoon and pre monsoon dry periods the average value of ph ec and tds were taken as representative value for a village it can be noted that 14 out of 40 villages 35 in the study area had acidic groundwater ph 6 5 as shown in fig 2 a the lowest groundwater ph 5 72 was recorded in the silagam village of kaviti mandal while the highest ph measured was 7 78 which was well below the maximum permissible limit for ph 8 5 in drinking water similar ph readings were recorded during the month of december 2018 and january 2019 post monsoon period as discussed earlier except chimakurthy mandal in prakasam district all the sampling locations are considered as control sites with respect to the uddanam region in srikakulam district the water quality parameters for these sampling locations are shown in table s2 it is interesting to note that only three villages out of hundred villages 3 had groundwater ph below 6 5 i e acidic groundwater these villages are kanimetta viziangaram district lodagalavami palem visakhapatnam district and rajavolu east godavari district it is also important to note the distinct differences in ph value of two ckd hotspots in andhra pradesh the chimakurthy mandal in prakasam and uddnam region in srikakulam thus it is found that uddanam region has acidic groundwater which is not the case in other districts mandals in andhra pradesh metals and heavy metals are more bio available in acidic groundwater as low ph favors their solubility in water magalhães et al 2015 tds is a measure of all the dissolved materials present in the water twenty out of 40 villages 50 in uddanam had a tds value greater than the bis acceptable limit for drinking water i e 500 mg l during the monsoon as presented in fig 2b twenty three 23 such villages observed when a repeat onsite monitoring was performed after two months in control areas and prakasam district tds in groundwater was found to be higher than 500 mg l at the majority of places 92 and tds ranged between 108 and 6064 mg l the lowest value of tds in groundwater was recorded in east godavari district which was possibly due to the groundwater recharge from godavari river water as we can see from table s2 that tds of groundwater is mainly composed of alkali and alkaline earth metals which have a positive effect on ph value thus higher tds value in groundwater has elevated the ph of groundwater to basic range ph 7 0 measurement of water hardness and its anions such as chloride cl fluoride f nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 phosphate po4 3 pesticides and other organics could not be performed due to severe cyclonic storm titli in the second week of october 2018 cyclone titli caused a huge loss to agriculture transport and wildlife of uddanam region however these parameters were measured during post monsoon and dry season may 2019 along with onsite measurement of ph and tds the representative value of these parameters is given in table s3 the average value of total hardness th was found to be 350 mg l which was above the acceptable limit 200 mg l and below the maximum permissible limit 600 mg l bis 2012 as shown in fig 3 a three villages of study area namely benkili and zinkibhadra sompeta mandal and devunalthada v kothuru mandal had a total hardness value above 600 mg l whereas six villages had total hardness in groundwater above 500 mg l the th value exceeded the acceptable limit 200 mg l for 55 of the villages in uddannam region chloride cl in general is the most common anion of groundwater tds its concentration in the groundwater samples collected from the study area ranged between 26 504 mg l with an average value of 193 mg l cl concentration did not exceed the maximum limit of drinking water 1000 mg l in any sample however 37 of the villages had cl concentration above the acceptable limit 200 mg l the mean nitrate no3 concentration in groundwater was measured to be 11 mg l which is below the permissible limit 45 mg l which is in contrast to the study conducted by reddy and gunasekar 2013 who reported 18 groundwater sample with no3 concentration beyond the prescribed standards sulfate so4 2 concentration in groundwater was 1 31 mg l with an average value of 14 mg l which is much below than the permissible limit 400 mg l it is well reported that use of nitrogen fertilizer urea in the paddy fields contributes to nitrate concentration in groundwater mahvi et al 2005 radfard et al 2018 phosphate po4 3 concentration in groundwater was found below detection bd in most of the water samples from the villages with a peak value of 6 mg l there is no bis standards for po4 3 concentration phosphate is not very mobile in soils or sediments thus retained in the soil zone however a significant quantity of phosphate may enter into groundwater where the soil and subsoil layers are shallow it is noteworthy that the prescribed concentration of phosphate in surface water is 0 03 mg l as p epa ireland 2019 which is recommended to avoid the eutrophication problem in water bodies such as lakes ponds and rivers first measurement of fluoride f concentration was completed in february 2019 three grab groundwater samples were collected from each village of the study area and analysis was completed at the site the average fluoride concentration was found to be 0 78 0 48 mg l n 120 which is within the bis drinking water standard value 1 5 mg l however the f concentration was measured beyond 1 5 mg l in few villages rentikota gokarnapuram and m s palli with peak value of 2 03 mg l in the rentikota village of palasa mandal fluoride levels in groundwater were also assessed after three months from the previous measurement i e pre monsoon dry season and presented in fig 3b the results of analysis for uddanam region are shown in table s3 average concentration was found to be 0 54 0 39 mg l n 40 which was lower than the average value 0 78 mg l measured in february 2019 in dry season also the f concentration was found above 1 mg l in the three villages with peak value of 2 10 mg l rentikota palasa mandal the important point to note here is that the samples analyzed in the month of february were individual samples three samples from each village while one composite sample from more than 5 locations of the same village was analyzed during the may 2019 irrespective of the sampling methodologies f concentration in the groundwater of the study area was found well below the prescribed limit 1 5 mg l similar levels of f in groundwater was recorded in vizianagram visakhapatnam west godavari and kadapa districts table s2 the lowest f concentration 0 01 0 08 mg l in groundwater was measured in machilipatnam mandal krishna district while proddattur mandal of kadapa had the highest f concentration 0 6 1 9 mg l relatively lower f concentration 0 15 0 43 mg l was present in groundwater samples collected from chimakurthy and its nearby in prakasam district reddy and gunasekar 2013 reported f concentration range 0 0 5 and 0 1 7 mg l respectively for uddanam mascarenhas et al 2017 observed average f concentration 0 4 0 2 and 0 26 mg l respectively in the groundwater of endemic non endemic and no ckd prevalence areas of concona region goa our findings indicate fluoride levels to be largely within the permissible limits wimalawansa 2014 and wasana et al 2016 while reporting on ckdu in sri lanka suggested a synergic effect of trace metals along with f in water furthermore they found a strong association of the combined effects of f heavy metals and hardness of drinking water on kidney tissues based on their histological evaluations wasana et al 2017 3 2 silica concentration the spatial variations in silica sio2 in groundwater sampled from uddanam are presented in fig 4 for the wet season and numerical values are given in table s3 for both wet and dry seasons the mean value of slilica in the study area was measured as 44 8 46 8 mg l n 40 while its mean value in other district was found to be 25 5 20 1 mg l n 90 this result for silica concentration is in accordance with study conducted by satyanarayana et al 2017 for uddanam there is no bis guideline value for silica in drinking water however the silica concentration in natural water is generally found to be less than 25 mg l apec water 2006 in this study the cutoff value for sio2 is taken as 40 mg l as significant silica induced cytotoxicity on a498 and human embryonic kidney hek cells was observed after 24 h exposure beyond this concentration mascarenhas et al 2017 silica concentration higher than 40 mg l had also been recorded in few groundwater samples collected from control areas of vizianagram visakhapatnam west godavari and guntur districts table s2 high level of silica in groundwater had been reported for other geographical regions of india mascarenhas et al 2017 measured mean silica concentration 115 mg l in groundwater of ckdu affected concona region of goa india while it was found only 14 mg l in its non ckd regions high silica concentration 119 mg l was observed in groundwater samples taken from villupuram district of tamil nadu india nepolian et al 2016 chaudhry et al 2019 measured silica concentration of 22 29 mg l in the groundwater of satluj river basin of rupnagar district punjab india 3 3 metals and heavy metals concentration metals and heavy metals concentration were found within the specified limit in most of the groundwater samples collected during the wet season monsoon table s1 the most common constituents of uddanam s groundwater were sodium 17 281 mg l magnesium 6 28 mg l and calcium 0 513 mg l however magnesium mg and calcium ca concentrations exceeded from the permissible limit for villages loharibanda mandasa mandal and devunalthada v kothuru mandal respectively besides iron fe concentration was found more than the specified bis permissible limit 0 3 mg l in the groundwater samples of 12 villages 30 of the study area the mean concentrations of sodium magnesium aluminium and calcium in groundwater collected from study area were 112 30 0 09 and 96 mg l n 40 respectivelywhile the mean concentration of these metals in groundwater of control areas n 81 100 were 134 50 0 11 and 118 mg l respectively chromium and manganese concentrations measured in groundwater were comparable for both the study and control areas interestingly higher iron concentrationof 0 55 0 90 mg l n 40 in groundwater samples of uddanam region was observed compared to the control areas 0 16 0 17 mg l n 80 moderate level of calcium in groundwater as hardness can be an etiological factor for ckd of multifactorial origin wimalawansa 2014 2016 wasana et al 2017 during monsoon season lead pb concentration was found marginally higher than the drinking water standards 0 01 mg l in the groundwater of the four villages 10 of the study area namely jadupudi kanchili mandal kidsingi and metturu vajrapukotturu mandal and rusikudda sompeta mandal as shown in fig 5 a moreover measurable quantity of pb was found in 80 villages of the study area it is important to note that pb was not found in quantifiable concentration in groundwater samples collected from the control sites as well as ckdu affected prakasam district trace levels of pb in groundwater was measured in nellore district in an earlier study raju et al 2014 a similar concentration of pb in groundwater was also observed in ckd affected concona region of goa india mascarenhas et al 2017 whereas trace pb concentration 0 02 0 10 mg l was measured in the groundwater samples collected from chennai india rajan and ponni 2016 nephrotoxicity of lead is well known as it can cause severe damage to kidney even at trace concentration level subject to chronic exposures mascarenhas et al 2017 cadmium cd and arsenic as are the other deleterious nephrotoxic metals fortunately found to be below detection bd in all groundwater samples of study and control areas however chromium cr was present in measurable concentration 0 004 0 013 mg l in 10 25 villages of the study area fig 5b slightly higher cr concentration 0 01 0 10 mg l was measured in 18 groundwater samples collected from the control sites located in west godavari guntur and nellore districts as well as in prakasam district these three heavy metals are well documented in literature for their kidney damage potential soderland et al 2010 cárdenas gonzález et al 2016 rehman et al 2018 tsai et al 2018 the source of heavy metals in uddanam groundwater are yet to be confirmed however we suspect both natural and anthropogenic sources as reported for other geographical regions nouri et al 2008 krishna et al 2009 chandrajith et al 2011 pazand et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 3 4 seasonal variation in ph tds silica and lead concentrations in order to find out the seasonal variations in groundwater quality samples were collected during three seasons by taking three months of monsoon period i e wet season aug to oct 2018 at the center though monsoon usually starts in the coastal region of andhra pradesh in the month of june end to july but to account the saturation of water and groundwater recharge from rainwater monsoon period in this study was counted from the month august the three month period dec 2018 feb 2019 was taken as the post monsoon period while the three month period april to june 2019 of intense heat was considered as pre monsoon dry season summer number of groundwater samples tested during monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons were 205 278 and 322 respectively for ph and tds while sio2 was measured in wet and dry seasons only the seasonal variation in ph tds and silica are presented in figs 6 8 respectively it can be seen from fig 6 that in general there was a noticeable drop in ph value during dry season summer compared to the wet season monsoon on the contrary tds value had slightly gone up fig 7 it indicates the influence of hydrogen ion releasing constituents with the increase in groundwater extraction as water requirement increases during summer in the post monsoon dec 2018 jan 2019 ph value in general was lower than the wet season but higher than the dry season seasonal variations in silica concentration in groundwater of uddanam is shown in fig 8 for wet and dry periods it can be seen that silica concentration in groundwater during wet periods sep oct 2018 was remarkably higher compared to dry period may 2019 the silica concentration in four villages namely amalpadu and chinnavanka vajrapukotturu mandal buragam kanchili mandal and balliputiga kaviti mandal had silica concentration above 40 mg l throughout the investigation period sep 2018 may 2019 an abnormal level in silica concentration was observed in the devunalthada village in which silica level was very high 300 mg l in wet period compared to dry period silica concentration 10 mg l another significant observation was the high silica concentration than the natural levels 25 mg l in 17 villages 43 during both wet and dry periods as discussed earlier silica concentration was reported above 100 mg l in ckdu affected villages of the canacona region of goa india mascarenhas et al 2017 moreover the present study is in concordance with mascarenhas et al 2017 with the acidic ph and borderline lead concentration 0 01 mg l in groundwater seasonal variations in lead concentration in groundwater of uddanam is shown in fig 9 for wet and dry periods it can be seen that 22 out of 40 villages 55 had groundwater lead concentration above the bis limit 0 01 mg l for drinking water during dry season pre monsoon compared to 3 villages 7 5 of wet season monsoon the highest pb concentration was measured 0 313 mg l in rangoi village during dry season dilution of groundwater due to groundwater recharge from rain water is the expected cause for lower lead concentration in wet season the four months period is wet period in uddanam thus higher lead in groundwater of most the villages of uddanam is evident for around two third period in year toxicity of lead is well reported for renal cells soderland et al 2010 wimalawansa 2014 mascarenhas et al 2017 hence presence of lead in groundwater is a serious concern 3 5 water quality of government supply schemes running for uddanam the water quality of the government supply schemes running for uddanam was measured during november 2018 the source of water for these schemes is groundwater which is extracted using electricity driven water pumps however water supplied from t sasanam is extracted from the well located on the bank of mahendratanya river the results obtained are presented in table s4 the ph of water was above 6 5 for most of the i e 6 out of 7 pumping stations the pumping station situated at b gongaputtiga had ph very near to 6 5 water supplied from ch kapaskuddi pumping station had tds value 800 mg l which is above the acceptable level of bis standards for drinking water generally toxic heavy metals such as chromium and arsenic concentrations in water samples from these pumping stations were found below detection water supplied from the borivanka pumping station had a trace concentration of chromium and arsenic which was very close to the bis drinking water standard value cr 0 05 mg l and as 0 01 mg l it was observed that the selenium concentration was marginally above the bis safe limit 0 01 mg l in all public water supplies i e cpws and rws running in uddanam the relation between selenium concentration of drinking water and ckdu is not known ntr sujala reverse osmosis ro plants were installed in all seven mandals of uddanam in recent past under public water supply scheme to meet the demand of safe drinking water for population living in ckd affected villages of uddanam an ntr sujala ro plant consists of a mother plant and several storage and distribution units in various villages for end users a mother plant raw groundwater is treated by passing it with pressurized sand filter activated carbon filter primary and secondary microfilters three stage ro modules and ultraviolet uv treatment units the treated water is stored in steel tanks which is transported to the storage and distribution unit of a village for end users the ph of water is maintained in the range of 6 5 8 5 at storage and distribution units and essential minerals are added the villagers take the drinking water in 20 l plastic container by using a smart water card at nominal cost rs 0 10 liter in this study ro water grab samples were collected for analysis from the ntr sujala ro mother plants as they are the main source of water supply and consumption however ro water from storage and distribution unit were also sampled for organics analysis the tested water quality parameters of ntr sujala ro mother plant are given in table s5 four out of seven plants had a ph below 6 5 which is expected for ro water as ions responsible for maintaining the ph near to neutral range are removed during the ro filtration thus mother plant ro needs the external addition of a basic buffer having ph at 6 5 8 5 range the ph of the ro water was found within the specified limit 6 5 8 5 during our onsite monitoring drives an important observation to note is that silica was not removed completely from water even after such comprehensive water treatment however silica concentration was reduced below 20 mg l which is safe for drinking toxic heavy metals like lead pb chromium cr copper cu selenium se and nickel ni were found to be below detection bd in all ro water samples these heavy metals are likely to be removed during water treatment at the ro mother plant aluminum al manganese mn zinc zn and barium ba were found in trace concentrations 0 01 0 06 mg l in ro water samples which was well below the bis standards moreover common metals in tap water were observed at normal levels 1 30 mg l it can be noted that ntr sujala ro water comes under best quality water hence this water is suitable for drinking in uddanam furthermore water induced etiology of ckdu in uddanam can be controlled by adopting ntr sujala water for drinking and cooking purposes recently cooray et al 2019 suggested nanofiltration nf membrane technology as a better alternative than ro technology for decontamination of groundwater in ckdu affected area in sri lanka based on their lab and pilot scale evaluation of nf plant the study reported the effective removal of hardness fluoride and dissolved organic carbon doc from groundwater with essential minerals still retaining in the water 3 6 pesticides and phthalates organics compounds in groundwater sample are least expected as the water is confined to soil beds and rocks however organics in groundwater in a region with a shallow water table can enter easily due to anthropogenic activities such as wastewater discharge and agricultural runoff groundwater table in uddanam region is shallow 1 5 m thus may be exposed to the organic pollution paddy is the major crop harvested in uddanam in which various types of agrochemicals are applied by farmers to increase crop production paddy farming holds the rainwater in fields for substantial periods 2 3 months also large number of ponds are constructed in this region which holds the water throughout the year people use these ponds for bathing livestock and utensil cleaning they throw the household garbage like polythene bags plastic bottles and sometimes household sewage to these ponds thus the chance of groundwater contamination with organic pollutants is very high hence analysis of organic constituents in groundwater is an important aspect in this study non targeted organics and targeted pesticides analyses was performed during non targeted analysis several unknown signals were observed in gc ms chromatogram of groundwater sample as shown in fig s1 relatively lesser number of peaks appeared in chromatogram of ro water sample fig s2 the identification of unknown signals was performed by mass fragmentation approach ms ms with the help of mass spectra libraries some of these unknown signals were identified as organic classes namely long chain fatty acids unsaturated ketones alcohol alkenes phthalates amides indoles and esters at least one phthalate molecule was present in all the twenty five water samples analyzed including six ntr ro sujala water samples plastic wastes are the suspected sources for phthalates in uddanam s groundwater ten chemically different phthalate molecules could be identified in the different water samples and chemical structure of these phthalates are shown in fig 10 presence of the phthalates such as dimethyl phthalate dmp diethyl phthalate dep dibutyl phthalate dbp di n octyl phthalate dnop diisoctyl phthalate diop di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp in water wastewater are well documented in literature lӧschner et al 2011 bono blay et al 2012 rani et al 2015 gani et al 2017 some of the phthalates identified in this study are the potential endocrine disrupting substances edcs such as dmp dehp and dbp johns et al 2015 katsikantami et al 2016 benjamin et al 2017 niu and zhang 2018 we also found phthalates dep and dbp in ro water samples this is the first study which reports the presence of phthalates in uddanam s groundwater however identification and quantification of phthalates for geographical regions of south india had been carried out in river water groundwater drinking water and wastewater samples by few reseachers selvaraj et al 2015 reported total phthalates in water and sediment samples of kaveri river between 313 and 1 640 ng l and 2 1 438 ng g dry weight respectively somashekar et al 2015 analyzed dbp concentration in various water samples collected from mysore india the analysis showed the presence of dbp in the range of 47 212 μg l the link between long term exposure of phthalates and development or progression of ckd is not fully understood wu et al 2018 total 20 pesticides were analyzed in water samples these pesticides were α β δ γ isomers of benzene hexachloride bhc ethion chlorpyrifos dieldrin atrazine butachlor alachlor aldrin 4 4 ddd malathion methyl parathion phorate endosulfan sulfate isoproturun monochrotophos 2 4 d and ddt none of these pesticides were found in measurable concentration in any groundwater sample as shown in table s6 in the supplementary information 4 conclusions various metals and heavy metals in the groundwater of uddanam were measured in moderate concentrations however their bioavailabilty is likely to be elevated at unsafe levels due to the acidic nature of water in acidic groundwater the measured concentrations of lead silica fluoride and hardness would need further evaluation to explore any association as potential environmental risk factors for development of ckd in the uddanam region we found high levels of silica and lead in groundwater sampled from several villages making this a major concern for the people in this region the presence of phthalates and its possible role in development and or progression of ckd needs further research therefore safe water supply in uddanam from a single centralized source is likely to improve the renal health status of the population author s contribution dr kanhaiya lal led the sample collection at project site and mentored the sample analyses at

110003 india uddanam region in srikakulam district of andhra pradesh india is a chronic kidney disease ckd hotspot with high prevalence of ckd of unknown etiology ckdu several investigators have suggested that groundwater contamination could be one of the factors contributing to the high prevalence of ckdu in this region this study focused on the monitoring and assessment of groundwater quality of uddanam with a major objective of identifying etiological factors of ckdu linked to drinking water composite groundwater sampling was carried out in 40 selected villages in uddanam and 100 villages of other nine districts in andhra pradesh during august 2018 may 2019 about 35 of villages in the study area had acidic groundwater ph 6 5 while only 3 villages in other districts had acidic groundwater moreover groundwater had elevated silica sio2 concentration 45 mg l during the monsoon wet season while high lead pb concentration 0 023 mg l was measured during pre monsoon dry season the lead concentration in the groundwater samples were found to be above the bureau of indian standards bis permissible limit 0 01 mg l in 55 of villages during dry season as compared to 10 during wet season fluoride f concentration in groundwater was found well below the bis permissible limit 1 5 mg l in 95 of villages of study area with mean concentration 0 54 mg l sd 0 40 synergic effects on kidney function of lead fluoride silica and water hardness in acidic water need to be explored in this study analysis of organic contaminants such as pesticides and phthalates in groundwater samples of the study area were also carried out pesticides were not found in any groundwater samples however phthalates were detected in all water samples groundwater treated with reverse osmosis ro process is recommended for drinking and cooking as a preventive measure for ckdu in uddanam graphical abstract image 1 keywords chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu drinking water fluoride heavy metals phthalates silica 1 introduction chronic kidney disease ckd in which kidney function slows down as the disease progresses leading to end stage kidney disease eskd and death if not treated with kidney replacement therapy has emerged as an important public health issue across the globe among all fatal diseases in india ckd is ranked eighth by the global burden of disease study jha and modi 2017 the million deaths study 2001 2013 report revealed that ckd related death rate in india doubled over a 10 year period in the 21st century particularly in the southern and eastern states of india dare et al 2017 diabetes and long standing hypertension are most frequent causes of ckd however the cause of kidney disease cannot be identified in a significant proportion of cases such cases have been dubbed ckd of uncertain etiology ckdu clustering of such cases has been reported from certain geographies such as uddanam region of srikakulam andhra pradesh india ganguli 2016 the local communities consider environmental factors such as impurities in drinking water to be responsible for the high burden of ckd however conclusive scientific evidence is yet to be established groundwater is the prime source of drinking and cooking purposes for the population living in the uddanam limited information is available about the quality of ground water in uddanam region reddy and gunasekar 2013 performed the groundwater quality monitoring of uddanam region and chimakurthy mandal another ckd hotspot in andhra pradesh with focus on inorganic constituents in water one time grab sampling was carried out during the dry season june 2011 and 34 groundwater water samples were collected from the bore wells hand pumps dug wells and public water supply stations located in kaviti palasa sompeta and vajrapukotturu mandals administrative divisions within a district of andhra pradesh of uddanam about 21 of the groundwater samples had ph below 6 5 18 samples were reported with total dissolved solids tds and nitrate above the recommended bureau of indian standards bis limit of 500 mg l and 45 mg l respectively the maximum fluoride concentration in water samples measured was 0 5 mg l silica and trace metals level were tested in 41 groundwater samples in which maximum silica concentration of 0 25 mg l was measured while 20 samples showed aluminum concentration above 0 2 mg l and 24 with iron concentration above the normal value 0 3 mg l trace heavy metals such as chromium lead and cadmium concentration ranges were 7 3 64 3 μg l 0 2 38 9 μg l and 0 1 5 μg l respectively while metalloid selenium had concentration range of 0 7 12 1 μg l pesticides other organics and seasonal variation in the concentration of inorganic contaminants was not investigated reported the study concluded overall good groundwater quality of uddanam region however a significant number of samples 18 24 violated the bis drinking water standards for ph tds nitrate aluminum and iron moreover chromium lead and cadmium were found in trace concentration and these can be harmful to the kidney if such water is consumed for several years in heat stressed geographical regions like uddanam gharibi et al 2012 wasana et al 2017 in another study by satyanarayana et al 2017 51 groundwater samples were collected from uddanam region and analyzed for general water quality parameters including silica one time sampling activities was performed during wet monsoon season the ph and tds ranges were reported to be 6 1 9 and 71 3117 mg l respectively whereas nitrate and silica concentration ranges were 0 4 12 mg l and 38 268 mg l respectively parameters like tds sodium na potassium k total hardness th chloride cl and sulfate could explain 54 9 of total variation in groundwater quality and therefore have been assigned under the first four principle components while silica sio2 and dissolved oxygen do could explain only 12 5 of total variance fluoride f heavy metals and organics in groundwater samples were not measured multivariate and temporal analysis of groundwater quality parameters had been recommended 1 1 ckdu in sri lanka like uddanam ckdu cases in rural farmers of the north central province of sri lanka were first noticed during the nineties several hypotheses have been introduced to explain the ckdu etiology but no conclusive evidence has been identified so far however most of these hypotheses suspect groundwater contaminants as a possible etiology for ckdu cooray et al 2019 both inorganic and organic contaminants of groundwater have been analyzed to find out their relation with ckdu most of the researchers were attracted to the inorganic contaminants such as hardness fluoride silica and heavy metals e g cadmium arsenic lead etc in groundwater and thus have been exclusively studied rango et al 2015 dharma wardana et al 2015 wasana et al 2016 2017 weragoda and kawakami 2017 balasooriya et al 2019 wimalawansa 2014 2016 suggested ckd of multifactorial origin ckdmfo ckdu due to the combined effects of various environmental factors such as ions heavy metals fluoride and agrochemicals peiris and brikowski 2017 2019 studied the spatial and temporal variations in groundwater quality of ckdu affected north central province of sri lanka nephrotoxic heavy metals such as arsenic 0 89 0 61 μg l cadmium 0 06 0 11 μg l and lead 3 53 7 84 μg l were measured well below the regulatory limits however they showed noticeable temporal as well as spatial variations the wet monsoon and dry summer are two extreme weather events in this region which have resulted in extensive water level changes in the aquifers causing temporal variation in these heavy metal concentrations the ro treatment of groundwater was found effective in removing the hardness and some heavy metals particularly arsenic and cadmium however prolonged consumption ro water and disposal of ro reject might be a concern pinto et al 2020 conducted a survey based study in the dry zone of sri lanka to figure out the possible relationship between water quality and ckdu they have identified the ecohydrological factors such as inefficient use of fertilizers and weedicides responsible for the deterioration of water quality moreover high levels of geogenic fluoride and water hardness might have a complicated multifactorial association with ckdu chandrajith et al 2020 reviewed the levels of geogenic fluoride and arsenic as reported in several groundwater monitoring studies the mean concentration of f in groundwater particularly in the dry zone metamorphic aquifers have been reported above 1 mg l over 50 of wells by several researchers however the as concentration in groundwater in general has been reported below the 10 μg l thus these two pollutants needs greater attention considering the health hazard of f they have also suggested the introduction of suitable defluoridation methods at the household level makehelwala et al 2020 investigated the interactions of ca2 and so42 ions with dissolved organic carbon doc such as humic acid in groundwater in depth characterization of the doc extracted from groundwater revealed the complexation of ca2 with carboxylate and sulfonate groups on humic acid which is postulated as a uremic toxicant the research group emphasized the need of further research to elucidate the role of doc in uremic toxicant formation recently in sri lanka the efforts were made to find the link between environmental contaminants and ckdu using animal model perera et al 2020 studied the effects of high water hardness with high fluoride on kidney and liver in rats the high levels of hardness and f resulted in acute tubular injury with a significant increase in serum levels of creatinine urea and ast activity which could be minimized by administering distilled water earlier perera et al 2018 had also reported the alterations in liver enzyme activities at early stages of f intoxication followed by renal damage wasana et al 2017 investigated and found strong evidence of synergic effect among cadmium fluoride and hardness of water on kidney tissues of mice which could lead to severe kidney damage in mice even at who maximum recommended levels the present study was undertaken under the study to test operationalize preventive approaches stop for ckdu in ap stop ckdu ap grand challenges project of the government of andhra pradesh goap indian council of medical resarch with main aim to establish the root causes responsible for the high burden of ckd in uddanam this report covers the assessment of the groundwater quality this specific component of the stop ckdu ap study was designed to assess the groundwater quality in the uddanam region in srikakulam district during the wet monsoon and dry summer seasons to capture the temporal variability of critical parameters the organics i e pesticides and phthalates were also analyzed in groundwater samples of uddanam for the first time in our knowledge the groundwater samples from chimakurthy and nearby mandals of prakasam district other ckd region were also collected and analyzed to investigate the differences in water quality groundwater samples were collected from eight other districts non ckd region of andhra pradesh to explore the differences in groundwater quality across the state which were considered as control sites with respect to uddanam region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area uddanam region is the northeast extension coastal region of srikakulam district andhra pradesh india latitude 18 56219 19 16563 n longitude 84 30934 84 76844 e this region consists of the seven block level administrative boundaries mandal namely vajrapukothuru v kothuru palasa mandasa sompeta kanchili kaviti and ichchapuram and accounting for 118 villages census data 2011 the uddanam region has very pleasant greenery of cashew and coconut trees with laterite soils rich in iron and aluminum palasa is the main town of uddanam which is also known as white gold city as about 300 medium and small scale cashew processing units are located in hereof paddy oryza sativa is the major agricultural produce which is grown mainly in the monsoon season the study area i e uddanam region is shown in fig 1 the detailed information about the demography of the study area and selection criteria of villages for the present study has been described elsewhere john et al 2019 in this study 40 out of 118 villages of uddanam were selected using probability proportional to size pps sampling method for conducting the epidemiological survey the same villages were taken for groundwater sampling to correlate with epidemiological findings each village of the study area was designated a number tag 1 40 for convenience in identification and spatial positioning as shown in fig 1 except in chimakurthy mandal of prakasam district ckd cases in all other geographical regions of andhra pradesh were reported sporadically and therefore these sampling spots were taken as control sites due to similar environmental conditions however machilipatnam mandal of krishna district was envisaged as the most suited control site due to sufficient distance 550 km from uddanam and similar coastal environment 2 2 sampling and chemical analysis 2 2 1 sampling water samples were collected from the groundwater extraction sources such as dug well borewell and handpump as per the central pollution control boad cpcb protocol for water sampling cpcb 2017 for a typical water sample from a village 1 l grab samples were collected from multiple locations n 3 10 within the administrative boundary of that village the grab samples thus collected were mixed in equal proportions 1 1 to make a representative composite sample of that village the composite water sample was filtered using whatman filter paper grade 1 pore size 11 μm and 1 l filtered water was collected the volume of water was divided in two equal parts each 500 ml and collected in a narrow and wide mouth high density polyethylene hdpe bottle tarsons product pvt ltd kolkata india thus total forty composite groundwater samples in duplicate were collected from forty villages of the study area during both monsoon wet september october 2018 and pre monsoon dry may 2019 seasons the water samples targeted for metals heavy metals analysis were acidified with 1 ml l hno3 fisher scientific purity 69 70 at the collection site both acidified and non acidified water samples were stored at 4 c and transported to nabl accredited laboratories for analysis other sources of water in the uddanam region sampled included comprehensive piped water supply cpws rural water supply rws schemes and reverse osmosis ro treated water at ntr sujala mother plants in each of the seven mandals the source of these public water supply schemes cpws and rws is groundwater extracted from mahendratanya river bed while groundwater is extracted from infiltration borewell for ntr sujala ro water supply seven individual grab water samples were collected at sources of all these public water supply schemes running for uddanam in order to understand the differences between the water quality of uddanam region and rest of places in andhra pradesh groundwater samples were collected from 100 different villages streets located in other 9 districts namely vizianagram visakhapatnam east godavari west godavari guntur krishna prakasam nellore and kadapa as shown in fig 1b for pesticides and organics analyses composite groundwater samples used for drinking and cooking purposes were collected in 2 l amber color hdpe bottle tarsons kolkata india to prevent their deterioration from solar radiations and were transported to the analytical facility within 12 h of the sample collection nineteen groundwater samples from houses and six ro water samples total 25 from ntr sujala mother plants located in each mandal were collected and analyzed for pesticides and organics such as phthalates 2 2 2 analysis measurements of general water quality parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds and temperature were done using portable water tester hi98130 ph ec tds temperature waterproof tester hanna instruments romania at the sampling sites fluoride in groundwater was measured onsite with fluoride checker hi 729 hanna romania hardness nitrate sulfate and phosphate concentration in groundwater collected in dry season were analyzed as per standard protocols is 3025 apha 2012 whereas silica concentration was measured by ammonium molybdate spectrophotometric method apha 2012 at simhadri lab visakhapatnam india metals and heavy metals were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms at noida testing laboratories noida india and spectro analytical labs limited bhubaneswar india the analytical results were verified at sadekar enviro engineers pvt ltd thane india and found within acceptable variation 3 the analysis of pesticides and unknown organics was started within 24 h of sample collection using gc ms ms instrument agilent technologies 7000 triple quadrupole ms ms at spectro analytical labs limited bhubaneswar india analysis of pesticides was performed according to the agilent 7000c msd method used for the analysis of residual pesticides in drinking water samples agilent technologies 2016 for the analysis of unknown organics in water samples a methodology developed by portolés et al 2011 was adopted the identification of unknown organic molecules was done with wiley and nist mass spectra libraries two water samples were collected in copper metal containers instead of hdpe plastic container to ensure that plastic container has not contributed phthalates itself to water samples being analyzed 2 3 geo spatial mapping and statistical analysis the longitude and latitude of the sampling locations were recorded using android mobile application my gps coordinates and the readings were verified with garmin gpsmap 64s handheld gps navigator the geographical data thus obtained was used for mapping with arcgis 10 5 software sas statistical software version 9 4 was used for data analysis and to investigate the correlation between water quality parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 general water quality parameters the general water quality parameters such as ph ec and tds were measured at the site of collection points during monsoon wet post monsoon and pre monsoon dry periods the average value of ph ec and tds were taken as representative value for a village it can be noted that 14 out of 40 villages 35 in the study area had acidic groundwater ph 6 5 as shown in fig 2 a the lowest groundwater ph 5 72 was recorded in the silagam village of kaviti mandal while the highest ph measured was 7 78 which was well below the maximum permissible limit for ph 8 5 in drinking water similar ph readings were recorded during the month of december 2018 and january 2019 post monsoon period as discussed earlier except chimakurthy mandal in prakasam district all the sampling locations are considered as control sites with respect to the uddanam region in srikakulam district the water quality parameters for these sampling locations are shown in table s2 it is interesting to note that only three villages out of hundred villages 3 had groundwater ph below 6 5 i e acidic groundwater these villages are kanimetta viziangaram district lodagalavami palem visakhapatnam district and rajavolu east godavari district it is also important to note the distinct differences in ph value of two ckd hotspots in andhra pradesh the chimakurthy mandal in prakasam and uddnam region in srikakulam thus it is found that uddanam region has acidic groundwater which is not the case in other districts mandals in andhra pradesh metals and heavy metals are more bio available in acidic groundwater as low ph favors their solubility in water magalhães et al 2015 tds is a measure of all the dissolved materials present in the water twenty out of 40 villages 50 in uddanam had a tds value greater than the bis acceptable limit for drinking water i e 500 mg l during the monsoon as presented in fig 2b twenty three 23 such villages observed when a repeat onsite monitoring was performed after two months in control areas and prakasam district tds in groundwater was found to be higher than 500 mg l at the majority of places 92 and tds ranged between 108 and 6064 mg l the lowest value of tds in groundwater was recorded in east godavari district which was possibly due to the groundwater recharge from godavari river water as we can see from table s2 that tds of groundwater is mainly composed of alkali and alkaline earth metals which have a positive effect on ph value thus higher tds value in groundwater has elevated the ph of groundwater to basic range ph 7 0 measurement of water hardness and its anions such as chloride cl fluoride f nitrate no3 sulfate so4 2 phosphate po4 3 pesticides and other organics could not be performed due to severe cyclonic storm titli in the second week of october 2018 cyclone titli caused a huge loss to agriculture transport and wildlife of uddanam region however these parameters were measured during post monsoon and dry season may 2019 along with onsite measurement of ph and tds the representative value of these parameters is given in table s3 the average value of total hardness th was found to be 350 mg l which was above the acceptable limit 200 mg l and below the maximum permissible limit 600 mg l bis 2012 as shown in fig 3 a three villages of study area namely benkili and zinkibhadra sompeta mandal and devunalthada v kothuru mandal had a total hardness value above 600 mg l whereas six villages had total hardness in groundwater above 500 mg l the th value exceeded the acceptable limit 200 mg l for 55 of the villages in uddannam region chloride cl in general is the most common anion of groundwater tds its concentration in the groundwater samples collected from the study area ranged between 26 504 mg l with an average value of 193 mg l cl concentration did not exceed the maximum limit of drinking water 1000 mg l in any sample however 37 of the villages had cl concentration above the acceptable limit 200 mg l the mean nitrate no3 concentration in groundwater was measured to be 11 mg l which is below the permissible limit 45 mg l which is in contrast to the study conducted by reddy and gunasekar 2013 who reported 18 groundwater sample with no3 concentration beyond the prescribed standards sulfate so4 2 concentration in groundwater was 1 31 mg l with an average value of 14 mg l which is much below than the permissible limit 400 mg l it is well reported that use of nitrogen fertilizer urea in the paddy fields contributes to nitrate concentration in groundwater mahvi et al 2005 radfard et al 2018 phosphate po4 3 concentration in groundwater was found below detection bd in most of the water samples from the villages with a peak value of 6 mg l there is no bis standards for po4 3 concentration phosphate is not very mobile in soils or sediments thus retained in the soil zone however a significant quantity of phosphate may enter into groundwater where the soil and subsoil layers are shallow it is noteworthy that the prescribed concentration of phosphate in surface water is 0 03 mg l as p epa ireland 2019 which is recommended to avoid the eutrophication problem in water bodies such as lakes ponds and rivers first measurement of fluoride f concentration was completed in february 2019 three grab groundwater samples were collected from each village of the study area and analysis was completed at the site the average fluoride concentration was found to be 0 78 0 48 mg l n 120 which is within the bis drinking water standard value 1 5 mg l however the f concentration was measured beyond 1 5 mg l in few villages rentikota gokarnapuram and m s palli with peak value of 2 03 mg l in the rentikota village of palasa mandal fluoride levels in groundwater were also assessed after three months from the previous measurement i e pre monsoon dry season and presented in fig 3b the results of analysis for uddanam region are shown in table s3 average concentration was found to be 0 54 0 39 mg l n 40 which was lower than the average value 0 78 mg l measured in february 2019 in dry season also the f concentration was found above 1 mg l in the three villages with peak value of 2 10 mg l rentikota palasa mandal the important point to note here is that the samples analyzed in the month of february were individual samples three samples from each village while one composite sample from more than 5 locations of the same village was analyzed during the may 2019 irrespective of the sampling methodologies f concentration in the groundwater of the study area was found well below the prescribed limit 1 5 mg l similar levels of f in groundwater was recorded in vizianagram visakhapatnam west godavari and kadapa districts table s2 the lowest f concentration 0 01 0 08 mg l in groundwater was measured in machilipatnam mandal krishna district while proddattur mandal of kadapa had the highest f concentration 0 6 1 9 mg l relatively lower f concentration 0 15 0 43 mg l was present in groundwater samples collected from chimakurthy and its nearby in prakasam district reddy and gunasekar 2013 reported f concentration range 0 0 5 and 0 1 7 mg l respectively for uddanam mascarenhas et al 2017 observed average f concentration 0 4 0 2 and 0 26 mg l respectively in the groundwater of endemic non endemic and no ckd prevalence areas of concona region goa our findings indicate fluoride levels to be largely within the permissible limits wimalawansa 2014 and wasana et al 2016 while reporting on ckdu in sri lanka suggested a synergic effect of trace metals along with f in water furthermore they found a strong association of the combined effects of f heavy metals and hardness of drinking water on kidney tissues based on their histological evaluations wasana et al 2017 3 2 silica concentration the spatial variations in silica sio2 in groundwater sampled from uddanam are presented in fig 4 for the wet season and numerical values are given in table s3 for both wet and dry seasons the mean value of slilica in the study area was measured as 44 8 46 8 mg l n 40 while its mean value in other district was found to be 25 5 20 1 mg l n 90 this result for silica concentration is in accordance with study conducted by satyanarayana et al 2017 for uddanam there is no bis guideline value for silica in drinking water however the silica concentration in natural water is generally found to be less than 25 mg l apec water 2006 in this study the cutoff value for sio2 is taken as 40 mg l as significant silica induced cytotoxicity on a498 and human embryonic kidney hek cells was observed after 24 h exposure beyond this concentration mascarenhas et al 2017 silica concentration higher than 40 mg l had also been recorded in few groundwater samples collected from control areas of vizianagram visakhapatnam west godavari and guntur districts table s2 high level of silica in groundwater had been reported for other geographical regions of india mascarenhas et al 2017 measured mean silica concentration 115 mg l in groundwater of ckdu affected concona region of goa india while it was found only 14 mg l in its non ckd regions high silica concentration 119 mg l was observed in groundwater samples taken from villupuram district of tamil nadu india nepolian et al 2016 chaudhry et al 2019 measured silica concentration of 22 29 mg l in the groundwater of satluj river basin of rupnagar district punjab india 3 3 metals and heavy metals concentration metals and heavy metals concentration were found within the specified limit in most of the groundwater samples collected during the wet season monsoon table s1 the most common constituents of uddanam s groundwater were sodium 17 281 mg l magnesium 6 28 mg l and calcium 0 513 mg l however magnesium mg and calcium ca concentrations exceeded from the permissible limit for villages loharibanda mandasa mandal and devunalthada v kothuru mandal respectively besides iron fe concentration was found more than the specified bis permissible limit 0 3 mg l in the groundwater samples of 12 villages 30 of the study area the mean concentrations of sodium magnesium aluminium and calcium in groundwater collected from study area were 112 30 0 09 and 96 mg l n 40 respectivelywhile the mean concentration of these metals in groundwater of control areas n 81 100 were 134 50 0 11 and 118 mg l respectively chromium and manganese concentrations measured in groundwater were comparable for both the study and control areas interestingly higher iron concentrationof 0 55 0 90 mg l n 40 in groundwater samples of uddanam region was observed compared to the control areas 0 16 0 17 mg l n 80 moderate level of calcium in groundwater as hardness can be an etiological factor for ckd of multifactorial origin wimalawansa 2014 2016 wasana et al 2017 during monsoon season lead pb concentration was found marginally higher than the drinking water standards 0 01 mg l in the groundwater of the four villages 10 of the study area namely jadupudi kanchili mandal kidsingi and metturu vajrapukotturu mandal and rusikudda sompeta mandal as shown in fig 5 a moreover measurable quantity of pb was found in 80 villages of the study area it is important to note that pb was not found in quantifiable concentration in groundwater samples collected from the control sites as well as ckdu affected prakasam district trace levels of pb in groundwater was measured in nellore district in an earlier study raju et al 2014 a similar concentration of pb in groundwater was also observed in ckd affected concona region of goa india mascarenhas et al 2017 whereas trace pb concentration 0 02 0 10 mg l was measured in the groundwater samples collected from chennai india rajan and ponni 2016 nephrotoxicity of lead is well known as it can cause severe damage to kidney even at trace concentration level subject to chronic exposures mascarenhas et al 2017 cadmium cd and arsenic as are the other deleterious nephrotoxic metals fortunately found to be below detection bd in all groundwater samples of study and control areas however chromium cr was present in measurable concentration 0 004 0 013 mg l in 10 25 villages of the study area fig 5b slightly higher cr concentration 0 01 0 10 mg l was measured in 18 groundwater samples collected from the control sites located in west godavari guntur and nellore districts as well as in prakasam district these three heavy metals are well documented in literature for their kidney damage potential soderland et al 2010 cárdenas gonzález et al 2016 rehman et al 2018 tsai et al 2018 the source of heavy metals in uddanam groundwater are yet to be confirmed however we suspect both natural and anthropogenic sources as reported for other geographical regions nouri et al 2008 krishna et al 2009 chandrajith et al 2011 pazand et al 2018 kumar et al 2019 3 4 seasonal variation in ph tds silica and lead concentrations in order to find out the seasonal variations in groundwater quality samples were collected during three seasons by taking three months of monsoon period i e wet season aug to oct 2018 at the center though monsoon usually starts in the coastal region of andhra pradesh in the month of june end to july but to account the saturation of water and groundwater recharge from rainwater monsoon period in this study was counted from the month august the three month period dec 2018 feb 2019 was taken as the post monsoon period while the three month period april to june 2019 of intense heat was considered as pre monsoon dry season summer number of groundwater samples tested during monsoon post monsoon and pre monsoon seasons were 205 278 and 322 respectively for ph and tds while sio2 was measured in wet and dry seasons only the seasonal variation in ph tds and silica are presented in figs 6 8 respectively it can be seen from fig 6 that in general there was a noticeable drop in ph value during dry season summer compared to the wet season monsoon on the contrary tds value had slightly gone up fig 7 it indicates the influence of hydrogen ion releasing constituents with the increase in groundwater extraction as water requirement increases during summer in the post monsoon dec 2018 jan 2019 ph value in general was lower than the wet season but higher than the dry season seasonal variations in silica concentration in groundwater of uddanam is shown in fig 8 for wet and dry periods it can be seen that silica concentration in groundwater during wet periods sep oct 2018 was remarkably higher compared to dry period may 2019 the silica concentration in four villages namely amalpadu and chinnavanka vajrapukotturu mandal buragam kanchili mandal and balliputiga kaviti mandal had silica concentration above 40 mg l throughout the investigation period sep 2018 may 2019 an abnormal level in silica concentration was observed in the devunalthada village in which silica level was very high 300 mg l in wet period compared to dry period silica concentration 10 mg l another significant observation was the high silica concentration than the natural levels 25 mg l in 17 villages 43 during both wet and dry periods as discussed earlier silica concentration was reported above 100 mg l in ckdu affected villages of the canacona region of goa india mascarenhas et al 2017 moreover the present study is in concordance with mascarenhas et al 2017 with the acidic ph and borderline lead concentration 0 01 mg l in groundwater seasonal variations in lead concentration in groundwater of uddanam is shown in fig 9 for wet and dry periods it can be seen that 22 out of 40 villages 55 had groundwater lead concentration above the bis limit 0 01 mg l for drinking water during dry season pre monsoon compared to 3 villages 7 5 of wet season monsoon the highest pb concentration was measured 0 313 mg l in rangoi village during dry season dilution of groundwater due to groundwater recharge from rain water is the expected cause for lower lead concentration in wet season the four months period is wet period in uddanam thus higher lead in groundwater of most the villages of uddanam is evident for around two third period in year toxicity of lead is well reported for renal cells soderland et al 2010 wimalawansa 2014 mascarenhas et al 2017 hence presence of lead in groundwater is a serious concern 3 5 water quality of government supply schemes running for uddanam the water quality of the government supply schemes running for uddanam was measured during november 2018 the source of water for these schemes is groundwater which is extracted using electricity driven water pumps however water supplied from t sasanam is extracted from the well located on the bank of mahendratanya river the results obtained are presented in table s4 the ph of water was above 6 5 for most of the i e 6 out of 7 pumping stations the pumping station situated at b gongaputtiga had ph very near to 6 5 water supplied from ch kapaskuddi pumping station had tds value 800 mg l which is above the acceptable level of bis standards for drinking water generally toxic heavy metals such as chromium and arsenic concentrations in water samples from these pumping stations were found below detection water supplied from the borivanka pumping station had a trace concentration of chromium and arsenic which was very close to the bis drinking water standard value cr 0 05 mg l and as 0 01 mg l it was observed that the selenium concentration was marginally above the bis safe limit 0 01 mg l in all public water supplies i e cpws and rws running in uddanam the relation between selenium concentration of drinking water and ckdu is not known ntr sujala reverse osmosis ro plants were installed in all seven mandals of uddanam in recent past under public water supply scheme to meet the demand of safe drinking water for population living in ckd affected villages of uddanam an ntr sujala ro plant consists of a mother plant and several storage and distribution units in various villages for end users a mother plant raw groundwater is treated by passing it with pressurized sand filter activated carbon filter primary and secondary microfilters three stage ro modules and ultraviolet uv treatment units the treated water is stored in steel tanks which is transported to the storage and distribution unit of a village for end users the ph of water is maintained in the range of 6 5 8 5 at storage and distribution units and essential minerals are added the villagers take the drinking water in 20 l plastic container by using a smart water card at nominal cost rs 0 10 liter in this study ro water grab samples were collected for analysis from the ntr sujala ro mother plants as they are the main source of water supply and consumption however ro water from storage and distribution unit were also sampled for organics analysis the tested water quality parameters of ntr sujala ro mother plant are given in table s5 four out of seven plants had a ph below 6 5 which is expected for ro water as ions responsible for maintaining the ph near to neutral range are removed during the ro filtration thus mother plant ro needs the external addition of a basic buffer having ph at 6 5 8 5 range the ph of the ro water was found within the specified limit 6 5 8 5 during our onsite monitoring drives an important observation to note is that silica was not removed completely from water even after such comprehensive water treatment however silica concentration was reduced below 20 mg l which is safe for drinking toxic heavy metals like lead pb chromium cr copper cu selenium se and nickel ni were found to be below detection bd in all ro water samples these heavy metals are likely to be removed during water treatment at the ro mother plant aluminum al manganese mn zinc zn and barium ba were found in trace concentrations 0 01 0 06 mg l in ro water samples which was well below the bis standards moreover common metals in tap water were observed at normal levels 1 30 mg l it can be noted that ntr sujala ro water comes under best quality water hence this water is suitable for drinking in uddanam furthermore water induced etiology of ckdu in uddanam can be controlled by adopting ntr sujala water for drinking and cooking purposes recently cooray et al 2019 suggested nanofiltration nf membrane technology as a better alternative than ro technology for decontamination of groundwater in ckdu affected area in sri lanka based on their lab and pilot scale evaluation of nf plant the study reported the effective removal of hardness fluoride and dissolved organic carbon doc from groundwater with essential minerals still retaining in the water 3 6 pesticides and phthalates organics compounds in groundwater sample are least expected as the water is confined to soil beds and rocks however organics in groundwater in a region with a shallow water table can enter easily due to anthropogenic activities such as wastewater discharge and agricultural runoff groundwater table in uddanam region is shallow 1 5 m thus may be exposed to the organic pollution paddy is the major crop harvested in uddanam in which various types of agrochemicals are applied by farmers to increase crop production paddy farming holds the rainwater in fields for substantial periods 2 3 months also large number of ponds are constructed in this region which holds the water throughout the year people use these ponds for bathing livestock and utensil cleaning they throw the household garbage like polythene bags plastic bottles and sometimes household sewage to these ponds thus the chance of groundwater contamination with organic pollutants is very high hence analysis of organic constituents in groundwater is an important aspect in this study non targeted organics and targeted pesticides analyses was performed during non targeted analysis several unknown signals were observed in gc ms chromatogram of groundwater sample as shown in fig s1 relatively lesser number of peaks appeared in chromatogram of ro water sample fig s2 the identification of unknown signals was performed by mass fragmentation approach ms ms with the help of mass spectra libraries some of these unknown signals were identified as organic classes namely long chain fatty acids unsaturated ketones alcohol alkenes phthalates amides indoles and esters at least one phthalate molecule was present in all the twenty five water samples analyzed including six ntr ro sujala water samples plastic wastes are the suspected sources for phthalates in uddanam s groundwater ten chemically different phthalate molecules could be identified in the different water samples and chemical structure of these phthalates are shown in fig 10 presence of the phthalates such as dimethyl phthalate dmp diethyl phthalate dep dibutyl phthalate dbp di n octyl phthalate dnop diisoctyl phthalate diop di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp in water wastewater are well documented in literature lӧschner et al 2011 bono blay et al 2012 rani et al 2015 gani et al 2017 some of the phthalates identified in this study are the potential endocrine disrupting substances edcs such as dmp dehp and dbp johns et al 2015 katsikantami et al 2016 benjamin et al 2017 niu and zhang 2018 we also found phthalates dep and dbp in ro water samples this is the first study which reports the presence of phthalates in uddanam s groundwater however identification and quantification of phthalates for geographical regions of south india had been carried out in river water groundwater drinking water and wastewater samples by few reseachers selvaraj et al 2015 reported total phthalates in water and sediment samples of kaveri river between 313 and 1 640 ng l and 2 1 438 ng g dry weight respectively somashekar et al 2015 analyzed dbp concentration in various water samples collected from mysore india the analysis showed the presence of dbp in the range of 47 212 μg l the link between long term exposure of phthalates and development or progression of ckd is not fully understood wu et al 2018 total 20 pesticides were analyzed in water samples these pesticides were α β δ γ isomers of benzene hexachloride bhc ethion chlorpyrifos dieldrin atrazine butachlor alachlor aldrin 4 4 ddd malathion methyl parathion phorate endosulfan sulfate isoproturun monochrotophos 2 4 d and ddt none of these pesticides were found in measurable concentration in any groundwater sample as shown in table s6 in the supplementary information 4 conclusions various metals and heavy metals in the groundwater of uddanam were measured in moderate concentrations however their bioavailabilty is likely to be elevated at unsafe levels due to the acidic nature of water in acidic groundwater the measured concentrations of lead silica fluoride and hardness would need further evaluation to explore any association as potential environmental risk factors for development of ckd in the uddanam region we found high levels of silica and lead in groundwater sampled from several villages making this a major concern for the people in this region the presence of phthalates and its possible role in development and or progression of ckd needs further research therefore safe water supply in uddanam from a single centralized source is likely to improve the renal health status of the population author s contribution dr kanhaiya lal led the sample collection at project site and mentored the sample analyses at

12076,potentiality for groundwater in the ndlambe municipality comprising of rocks of the witteberg group cape supergroup was investigated using a combination of different approaches distribution of lineaments extracted from a satellite image is hardly homogenous their density varies with different localities areas around the western and southwestern parts of the study area have relatively high density values 39 while the northern eastern and northeastern parts of the area of study are dominated by low density values 0 39 boreholes located in the northeastern part appear to be away from the zones of dense lineaments have dried up and were found not to be productive in the northwest parts of the study area there are several locations displaying intersections of lineaments these zones of high lineament intersection can be targeted for groundwater exploration most of the lineaments in the study area trend in a northeast southwest direction this trend would be identical to the orientation of the preferential flow path quartz veins and normal faults seen in the field are good indicators for groundwater potential as they are a structural expression of extensional environmentsthe same applies to quartz grains affected by extensional micro fractures which resulted from brittle deformation as seen under the microscope subsurface geology investigation from borehole logging has depicted fractures in quartzitic sandstones thus micro fractures in quartz grains and quartzitic sandstones enhance secondary porosity and groundwater flow low resistivities from the geophysical investigation in the study area were inferred to be weathered moist sandstone the low resistivities at depth also indicate an overlying zone of fractured sandstone and quartzite hence possibility of hosting some groundwater low resistivity zones between two large bodies suggest that the massive rock bodies are being weathered and fractured and fractures act as conduits for groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords remote sensing lineaments resistivity groundwater borehole 1 introduction the ndlambe municipality is part of the cacadu district eastern cape province south africa fig 1 the eastern cape like other many provinces faces the challenge of groundwater scarcity in 2018 the city of cape town was expecting what was known as day zero a day when taps in the city run dry and people start queuing for water the eastern cape province has for instance virtually no groundwater can be found in most of the aquifers dept of water affairs forestry 2002 there are already problems of supply and quality regarding water provision with an estimated eight million south africans currently having no access to potable water eberhrd and pegram 2000 one third of all households in south africa lack access to basic water services with the majority of these being located in rural areas these historical inequalities have led to a sound policy of investment of infrastructures for these households the cost of water will also increase as larger schemes are required to transfer available water to urban centers where the greatest growth in demand is likely to occur unless proactive strategic measures are taken to address this water shortage the macroeconomic impact of water scarcity may have a crippling effect on south africa s ability to meet the development requirements of its people there has also been an associated decrease in water quality associated with both point source effluent discharge and diffuse impacts from land use wash off the increased interest in recent years in underground sources of water has led to a need for more intensive studies of the geometry and properties of aquifers asry et al 2012 this is because over half of the world s population depends on groundwater for drinkingaasst1 water supplies for instance in the united kingdom about 30 of the public water supplies are derived from groundwater in the united states of america about 50 denmark 99 tebbuth 1998 and german 70 in terms of south africa s overall water consumption groundwater contributes only some 15 of the total volume consumed dept of water affairs forestry 2002 groundwater resource assessments and sustainability considerations are of utmost importance in the arid and semiarid regions where water is commonly of critical economic and social significance most countries located within the arid and semi arid regions like south africa are categorized as water stressed basson and van rooven 1998 and depend primarily on groundwater as the water supply for various developmental activities therefore understanding the nature of groundwater circulation and characteristics of the aquifer is crucial for sustainable development of the country s water resources the most recent scientific estimates place groundwater in south africa in the same league volumetrically as our stored surface water resources the total volume of available renewable groundwater in south africa the utilisable groundwater exploitation potential or ugep is 10 343 million m³ a or 7500 million m³ a under drought conditions vegter 2006 the eastern cape is one of the provinces faced with the challenge of supplying clean fresh water to the communities residing in it drilling and finding productive boreholes in the karoo aquifers is not always an easy task madi and zhao 2013 thus more studies need to be done to alleviate such problems ndlambe municipality is a case in point where the population is greatly dependent on groundwater resources for both domestic and agricultural activities farming forms the brunt of the economic activities of this region the aquifer types are mapped as fractured with a low to fairly high development potential and the higher yielding areas are structurally controlled baron et al 1998 over 80 of south africa is underlain by relatively low yielding shallow weathered and or fractured rock aquifer systems vegter 2001 by contrast appreciable quantities of groundwater can be abstracted at relatively high rates from dolomitic and quartzitic aquifer systems located in the northern and southern parts of the country respectively as well as from a number of primary aquifers situated along the coastline vegter 2001 of which port alfred is located in addition few studies have been undertaken to evaluate groundwater resource in the area of port alfred this lack of information could hinder efficient and prudent groundwater development a thorough study to characterize the groundwater flow system and determine aquifer systems in the area is needed to address these gaps in the study area this study therefore is an attempt to evaluate the groundwater resource as a way of achieving the goal of water sustainability 2 regional geology ndlambe municipality fig 2 and fig 3 is geologically setting within the cape fold belt which extends across the southern tip of africa between latitudes 31 and 35 south and longitudes 18 and 27 east fig 3 few rocks of the dwyka group diamictite crops out nearby the cape fold belt extends for approximately 1300 km along the southern part of the south african coastal margin tankard et al 2009 where predominantly meta sedimentary rocks of late proterozoic pre cape palaeozoic cape supergroup and mesozoic karoo supergroup age outcrop and define two arms the main southern arm has an east west trend and the north northwesterly trending arm forms the western part of the fold belt de beer 1992 arenaceous and argillaceous sediments of the cape supergroup were deposited in a wedge shaped sedimentary prism on a passive margin during ordovician to permian times in response to negative tectonic inversion of saldanian province basement rocks tankard et al 1982 broquet 1992 cole 1992 shone and booth 2005 thamm and johnson 2006 stratigraphically the cape supergroup comprises the table mountain group at the base overlain by the bokkeveld group and the latter in turn by the witteberg group table 1 the total apparent thickness of this package is some 10 000 m johnson et al 2006 the table mountain group which makes up the mountainous terrain everywhere is composed of mainly clean quartzites and lesser proportions of shales with only one prominent argillaceous formation the cedarberg shale formation in contrast the bokkeveld group makes up subdued rolling hill topography and is composed of predominantly black shale with lesser dark coloured quartzites the witteberg group has about equal proportions of quartzite and shale pre cape rocks composed of schists gneisses quartzites and metamorphosed carbonates occur mainly along the coastal regions of the western cape and as inliers within the cape fold belt and form the basement to the cape supergroup barnett et al 1997 le roux 1998 these rocks yield dates varying between 560 and 1100 ma armstrong et al 1998 gresse et al 2006 and are interpreted as shallow marine clastic and chemical sediments which were deformed and metamorphosed during the late proterozoic saldanian orogeny halbich 1992 gresse et al 2006 frimmel et al 2001 pre cape rocks as well as cape and overlying karoo supergroups were deformed during the cape orogeny which comprised four main paroxysms from the late palaeozoic to early mesozoic halbich 1983 the cape supergroup overlies basement rocks composed of schist gneisses and carbonates occurring as inliers in the cape fold belt and in turn is overlain by glacial turbidite and terrestrial deposits and basaltic lavas of the karoo supergroup halbich 1983 2 1 stratigraphy the palaeozoic cape supergroup is divided into three groups table mountain bokkeveld and witteberg tables 1 3 comprising rocks of clastic origin derived from a northern provenance area and deposited in a continental shelf setting tankard et al 1982 broquet 1992 tankard et al 2009 proposed that the environment of deposition changed from shallow marine and terrestrial with minor glacial interludes in the table mountain group to a deltaic and shallow marine shelf setting bokkeveld and witteberg groups rocks of the bokkeveld group are composed of an upper mainly argillaceous sequence and a lower sequence of argillaceous and arenaceous rocks these rocks were deposited conformably on those of the table mountain group in a transgressive regressive setting and this setting reflects a history of greater tectonic control in the deposition of sediments than in table mountain group times rust 1973 the witteberg group occurs as the northernmost outcrop of the cape supergroup and is composed of approximately equal proportions of sandstone and shale table 1 with a diamictite horizon near the top of the sequence the karoo supergroup that unconformably overlies the cape supergroup has a basal sequence of extensive tillite deposits of the dwyka formation overlying the dwyka formation are shallow marine deposits followed conformably by a thick sequence of terrestrial deposits and capped by a succession of volcanic rocks tankard et al 1982 the latter rocks occur as a large erosional remnant in the central eastern part of south africa forming the highest mountains in the country 3 material and methods 3 1 remote sensing remote sensing was used to map lineaments as this has an immense importance on hard rock hydrogeology as it can identify rock fractures khodaei and nassery 2011 mukherjee 2008 adewumi and anifowose 2017 acharya et al 2017 https www tandfonline com author waters 2c pauline waters et al 1990 solomon 2003 that could be groundwater localizers remote sensing was used in order to depict zones of high density surface lineaments for groundwater targets the regional fracture pattern was assessed by tracing of lineaments from 1 100000 scale black and white prints spectral band 5 landsat satellite photographs satellite images landsat 4 5 tm were chosen because they offer good scenes that can be exploited from remote sensing in order to extract linear features lineaments almost uniquely coincide with structural bedrock features related to increased frequencies of joints shear fractures and smaller faults and layers and lenses of faulted rocks the mapping of lineaments was done manually through the use of arcgis 10 2 software the first stage was downloading the digital elevation model a 30 m level 1 dem produced by the united states geologic survey usgs interpolated from topography was used for the purpose of this study it was loaded onto the software where the hillshade feature was applied to refine the data the following characteristics were used as guides for identifying lineaments on the imagery landform expressions linear ridges or valleys aligned saddles or breaks in slope cross drainage alignments drainage pattern expressions linear or aligned streams or stream segments abrupt irregular changes in stream direction abrupt changes in vegetation characteristics indicating a natural boundary change in surface characteristics or vegetation community composition also linear vegetation patterns changes in surface texture or patterns expressed on imagery indicating a change in surface subsurface characteristics on completion of the mapping of the lineaments they were together with existing boreholes overlain on the geology map of the area as well as in the area the lineament shapefile was exported into cad to construct a rose diagram using rockworks software that produced the major trend of digitized lineaments 3 2 geological observations the geological investigation was done in and around the ndlambe municipality in order to look at the rock types that crop out and associated structural deformations quartzites sandstones siltstones and shales are the main outcrops found in the area they were affected by folding and faulting normal and reverse and as well as veins which are fractures filled with mineral crystals that precipitated from watery solution mostly quartz veins are prominent and indicate hydrothermal activity rock samples were collected in the field for microscopic studies transmitted light and scanning electron microscopy in order to depict the deformational structures that can be indicative of secondary permeability which can be favourable for groundwater flow for scanning electron microscopy quartzite sandstone and siltstone samples were cut into small slabs and were prepared at the department of geology university of stellenbosch the equipment used for sem at stellenbosch is the zeiss evo ma15vp which is equipped with a backscattered electron detector bsd the sem function generally focuses a beam of electrons which interact with the atoms in the sample generating signals that provide information about the surface morphology texture crystalline structure and orientation of materials within the sample 3 3 subsurface lithology aquifers can be identified through detailed hydrogeological surveys using surface and subsurface geological methods four borehole logs were used for understanding the subsurface and identifying rock properties subsurface lithology plays an important role in delineating subsurface structures estimating aquifer depths and groundwater distribution analysis of borehole log data was done by sedlog 3 1 software and microsoft power point therefore conducting sub surface lithology investigations in the study area is important to delineate the depth of viable aquifers for sustainable water supply 3 4 geophysical surveys the major objective of geophysics applied to hydrogeology is to deliver parameters and subsurface models which are helpful for the decision making process in groundwater exploration and groundwater protection geophysical investigations also provide excellent vertical profile information on the lithology flow components structure permeability porosity and water quality of the groundwater system the application of geophysical methods is indispensable as it reduces the trial and error technique that has been used where many boreholes had to be drilled to strike the target as such they are more dependable and precise methods of groundwater search than any other in the sub surface structural investigation electrical resistivity was applied to the study area for the electrical resistivity technique vertical electrical sounding ves and electrical resistivity profiling erp were carried out at chosen sites in order to obtain the geoelectric parameters of the subsurface that can be linked to the physical properties of the aquifer the drilling of boreholes for the purpose of obtaining subsurface information is usually expensive and time consuming the use of electrical resistivity surveys provides a relatively inexpensive and rapid alternative to obtaining such data many other researchers have used electrical resistivity to explore for groundwater mohamaden and ehab 2017 riwayat et al 2018 https onlinelibrary wiley com action dosearch contribauthorstored limaye 2c shrikant daji limaye 2016 mohamadenhamouda and mansour 2016 fieldwork was done between the period of february and march 2018 the schlumberger configuration which is efficient in the exploration of groundwater hassan et al 2017 vasantrao et al 2017 was used to determine the apparent resistivity two resistivity instruments were used to conduct the survey geotron resistivity meter model g41 and the syscal pro resistivity meter geotron resistivity meter model g41 and its accessories cables steel electrodes hammers and gps was used to produce apparent resistivity pseudosections calculated apparent resistivity and the inverse model resistivity through the use of geotron resistivity meter two potential and two current electrodes were placed along a straight line the array being symmetrical around the middle point 0 current electrodes were placed at a and b and potential electrodes placed at m and n the distance between the potential electrodes mn was kept much smaller than the distance between the current electrodes ab the distance between the current electrodes was increased from a minimum ab 2 of 1 5 m to a maximum of 100 m current electrode spacing was chosen such that there were six logarithmically spacing resulting in ab spacing equals to 1 5 2 3 5 7 10 15 20 30 50 70 100 m as the current electrode spacing increases the potential signal decreases therefore half the potential electrode spacing mn 2 was increased by increasing the current electrode spacing the current penetrates deeper into the earth and information is received on resistivity at greater depths the vertical electrical soundings were done on four locations around port alfred area some sounding stations were measured nearby the existing wells to parameterize the geoelectrical measurements in view of the lithological succession layers thickness and depth to the water bearing layers well information was used to control the interpretation of the field data the interpretation process is based preliminary on a model using the available geological and hydrological information beside well data the syscal pro resistivity meter combines transmitter and receiver in a single module powered by a 12 v battery and whose specifications include output voltage up to 1000 v the syscal pro is multichannel equipment which allows multiple potential dipoles to be used simultaneously to obtain the resistivity measurements the dipole dipole arrangement allows fairly quick data acquisition and enables studying the lateral variation of a given physical parameter at different depths this arrangement has the current ab and the potential mn dipoles which are most commonly placed linearly on the ground the spacing between a and b is equal to the spacing between m and n both of which remain unchanged during data acquisition the measurements are plotted at the intersection of lines starting from the centers of the current and voltage dipoles and form a 45 degree angle with the horizontal mello et al 2014 three lines of investigation were performed in the area of study line 1 was 320 m long line 2 was 480 m long line 3 was 320 m calculated apparent resistivity values for each sounding produced by the geotron resistivity meter were plotted against half current electrode separation ab 2 on a log log graph the acquired vertical electrical sounding data was presented as sounding curves the curves were quantitatively interpreted by partial curve matching using three layer model curves and corresponding auxiliary curves theoretical vertical electrical sounding curves were generated from the partial curve matching interpretation results using the win resist computer programme data collected by the two instruments were processed using the res2dinv software this software adopts a rapid technique for inverting apparent resistivity data into actual resistivity which is much more useful for geological interpretation theoretically it produces a subsurface geoelectrical 2 d model free of the distortions from the pseudo sections of apparent resistivity caused by the geometry array used mello et al 2014 some sounding stations were measured nearby the existing wells to parameterize the geoelectrical measurements in view of the lithological succession layers thickness and depth to water bearing layers well information was used to control the interpretation of the field data the interpretation process is based preliminary on a model using the available geological and hydrological information beside well data 4 results 4 1 remote sensing lineaments were mapped and analysed using the rose diagram lineament density and lineament frequency parameters the results of the analysis are presented as the lineament map lineament density map and rose diagram the lineament map shows that lineament distribution is hardly homogenous fig 4 the type of lineaments identified has in many cases shown to indicate the location of brittle deformation the majority of the fractures are located on lithologies that are of the witteberg sequences which are regions that have been induced to faulting and thrusting in some cases however the lineaments are related to geological structures other than brittle deformation such as ductile deformation lithological changes and alterations that are unrelated to structures in the rock johan and mats 2007 the lineament density variation map fig 5 shows the lineament numbers to be varying at different localities the denser lineaments could possibly represent regions that are mostly dominated by quartzite of the witteberg group areas around the western and southwestern parts of the study area have relatively high density values 39 while the northern eastern and northeastern parts of the area of study are dominated by low density values 0 39 the zones of relatively high lineament density are identified as zones of high degree of rock fracturing which are prerequisite for groundwater conduit development in an area edet et al 1998 in the north west parts of the study area there are several locations where there are intersections of lineaments lineament intersection provides an interpretation of hidden subsurface tectonic configuration in the form of linear feature intersection cross cutting geological structures which are indicators of deep seated fracture fault medium mogaji1 et al 2011 therefore zones of high lineament intersection over the study area are feasible zones for groundwater targeting in the study area fig 4 clearly shows the distribution of boreholes in relation to the lineaments most of the borehole sites specifically in the northeastern parts are away from the lineaments according to internal studies that have been made concerning water level measurement by the department of water services several boreholes have dried up in the northeastern parts which correlate with regions that have low density distribution of lineaments this suggests that in the future more boreholes could be drilled in the southwestern parts of the study as these areas are characterized by high lineament density hence potential zones for groundwater the orientation of the lineaments is analysed by constructing a rose diagram which clearly shows the azimuthal distribution of the data fig 6 even though these diagrams are not length weighted they can indicate on each occasion what the most dominant directions of the fractures are this analysis is very critical for the study of groundwater flow as in most cases the orientation of the fractures is identical to the orientation of the preferential flow path pothiraj and baskaran 2013 the rose diagram of the detected lineaments shows two prominent trends in the directions of northeast and southwest axes a comparison with fig 4 shows that the prominent lineament trends are correlated with high density variation of the study area this can be an indication of the direction of groundwater movement in the study area most of the lineaments that clusters the south west part of the region are s 210 285 w trending lineaments whereas in the north east part of the region lineaments tend to cluster in n 38 85 e direction these findings correlate that of de wit and ransome 1992 who suggested that the cape fold belt has been subjected to episodes of compression and extension that led to intense shortening of the rock body besides deformation was more intense in the southern domain of the cape fold belt and this domain is characterised by east west trending and north verging folds and faults de beer 1995 the predominant orientation of lineaments as seen in the rose diagram fig 6 is quite contrasting with the ones highlighted by madi and zhao 2013 4 2 geological investigations some outcrops were found in the ndlambe municipality in and around the town of port alfred evidence of tectonic movements folding faulting overturned beds etc were noted during field investigations fig 7 a and b show a faulted zone in fig 7 a one can see horizontal beds of siltstone adjacent to vertical beds of the same siltstone fig 7 b it is worth noting that such a normal fault with a dip angle of 90 indicates extensional tectonics and accordingly good indication for structural deformation that can be considered for groundwater flow according to anderson s theory of faulting sigma 1 is vertical while sigma 2 and sigma 3 are horizontal fig 7 c shows an unconformity acting as an erosional surface that marks an angular discordance with sedimentation units that were deposited in two phases the first unit has vertical beds of quartzitic sandstones which were previously horizontal and were undoubtedly overturned during the cape orogeny to become vertical after the tectonic movement a long period elapsed and a channel started flowing and eroding the overturned bed depositing some quartzite pebbles that were set on top of the erosional surface the quartzite pebbles are roundish and very resistant this is indicative of a very long distance of transportation the channel continued flowing and deposited sandstone bed that can be seen on top of the erosional surface a reverse fault fig 7 d that cut across some weathered sandstones with non systematic joints was found at another place the hanging wall and the footwall above and below the reverse fault respectively has shattered sandstones with non systematic joints systematic joints are good for stress inversion methodologies e g delvaux and sperner 2003 to infer the orientation of the stress field in a given area whereas non systematic joints are good for engineering geology and groundwater flow pluijm and marshak 2004 according to anderson theory of faulting reverse faulting is a response to an applied vertical sigma 3 while sigma 1 and sigma 2 are horizontal the occurrence of normal faulting and reverse faulting in the same area is indicative contrasting tectonics at two different periods since a normal and reverse fault cannot derive from the same tectonic event at another location some carbonaceous shales crop out they underwent shear movement and were overturned occurring now in a monocline like structure one can see the schistose texture within them fig 7 f indicative of regional metamorphism shale slate phyllite schist these carbonaceous shales probably developed in a lagoon in which the mud might have mixed with organic material hydrothermal activity has never been reported in the area of port alfred which is located some 60 km southeast of grahamstown for the first time it was highlighted the occurrence of hydrothermal quartz veins which play an important role in the formation of kaolin by acting as impermeable barriers in trapping the water that leads to weathering of the dwyka tillite madi and zhao 2011 blocky quartz veins fig 7 e occurring in weathered sandstones can be seen in some areas of port alfred ndlambe municipality blocky veins means that the vein was an open cavity when the mineral precipitated and this can only be possible if veins formed near the surface where rock strength is sufficient to permit a cavity to stay open or fluid pressure is great enough to hold the fracture open van der pluijm and marshak 2004 the presence of hydrothermal quartz veins indicate extensional movements in the area analysis of quartzitic sandstone fig 8 a showed that it consists of coarse monocrystalline grains which may have resulted from the enrichment of nonundulatory quartz the quartzite derived from quartz arenite due to the effect of high pressure and temperatures this quartzite has a lot of microfractures mostly planar and few of them are curviplanar fig 8 a and b these mode i microfractures result from extensional stress σ3 which act perpendicular to them anders et al 2014 and thus generating secondary porosity and enhancing groundwater flow there is very little mica and more quartz fine grained quartz has acted as a cement in between quartz grains some of the cracks have been filled by secondary minerals like muscovite the thin section in fig 8 c shows a fine grained quartz arenite of the cape supergroup the quartz arenite shows some fractures filled with muscovite fig 8 c and d quartz veins record a plastic deformation as they are mostly elongated fractures in the rock and plastic deformation as seen in the quartz grains are typical of a frictional plastic transitional zone plastic deformation in quartz starts occurring at a temperature of 350 c the occurrence of muscovite seen within the fractures was also confirmed through scanning electron microscopic analysis fig 8 d in this figure the mica is seen within a fractured quartz grain the fractures seen in the quartz grains are very important as they play a role in the flow of groundwater acting as structures for secondary permeability 4 2 1 subsurface lithology four borehole logs data provided by srk consulting were used for understanding the subsurface identifying properties of rocks and geologic interpretation borehole logs have been used for the purpose of this study to characterize lithology permeability and flow conditions in the area of port alfred analysis of borehole log data is done by sedlog 3 1 software and microsoft power point the four boreholes are identified as ec p40 162 ec p40 158 ec p40 002 and ec p40 160 fig 9 a shows a borehole lithological column with a total depth of 149 m the stratigraphy established from the lithological log shows three lithological units shale quartzitic sandstone and diamictite the top layer consists of weathered quartzitic sandstone with a depth of 3 m due to weathering this enhances permeability and allows groundwater movement at depths of 3 m up to 35 m the column is characterised with quartzitic sandstone that is unweathered suggesting that the region is characterised with low groundwater localisation with an increase in depth there is an alteration of quartzitic sandstone and shale high thickness of clay at 75 m impedes groundwater movement at depths of 80 m to 115 m there is fractured quartzitic sandstone which is highly permeable this zone is confined by two non porous layers of shale which makes it a good aquifer fig 9 b shows a borehole lithological column with a total depth of 169 m the stratigraphy established from the lithological log shows two lithological units quarzitic sandstone and shale the top layer comprises of clay sand clay sand is highly porous therefore enhances infiltration of water promoting groundwater availability below the clay sand there is a highly weathered zone of 14 m which could be highly permeable and favourable for groundwater the lithological column is further characterised by the alteration of fractured quartzitic sandstone and shale at depths between 93 and 144 m the zone is characterised by fractured quartzitic sandstone and shale fractured shale further promotes infiltration of water and groundwater flow is enhanced with increase in depth the lithological column is characterised by an impermeable layer of shale with a thickness of 14 m and this zone impedes the further movement of groundwater fig 10 a shows a borehole lithological column with a total depth of 146 m the stratigraphy established from the lithological log shows two lithological units quartzitic sandstone and shale the top layer is characterised by dry clay with a depth of 4 m below the dry clay zone is shale layer with a thickness of 26 m high thickness of clay acts as an aquitard which impedes groundwater recharging and increases runoff during the rainy season with the increase in depth there is fractured quartzitic sandstone which could be inferred as a permeable zone for groundwater localisation generally the lithological column has a low potential zone for groundwater as the bedrock is slightly weathered fig 10 b shows a borehole lithological column with a total depth of 120 m the stratigraphy established from the lithological log shows three lithological units quartzitic sandstone sandstone and dolerite the top layer is clay sand with a thickness of 3 m followed by weathered sandstone at depths between 3 m and 25 m fractured quartzitic sandstone is ranging from depths of 25 m 79 m this could be inferred to be an aquifer zone for groundwater localisation this is further favoured by fractured dolerite at depths of 79 120 m and it is good for groundwater channels due to its fractured nature it can be considered a good permeable conduit for groundwater the fracturing of bedrock formations is as a result of structural deformation summary of the field well data for the 4 selected boreholes can be seen in table 4 the pumping test indicated that there was a numerous water strikes during drilling the water strikes points to an obvious occurrence of water reservoirs which can be related to the potentiality of groundwater in the area of port alfred 4 3 geophysical survey 4 3 1 overview on resistivity data collected by the geophysical equipment were processed using the res2dinv software this software adopts a rapid technique for inverting apparent resistivity data into actual resistivity which is much more useful for geological interpretation theoretically it produces a subsurface geoelectrical 2 d model free of the distortions from the pseudo sections of apparent resistivity caused by the geometry array used mello et al 2014 for the electrical resistivity technique vertical electrical sounding ves was carried out at chosen sites in order to obtain the geoelectric parameters of the subsurface that can be linked to the physical properties of the aquifer the vertical electrical soundings carried out on four locations around port alfred area some sounding stations the concept of resistivity is based on ohm s law which states that r v i resistivity can be mathematically defined as ρ r a l where r resistance ω vpotential difference v icurrent strength amps ρ resistivity a area m l length m each lithological unit has a characteristic range of resistivity haque et al 2015 dominika stan and stan kłeczek 2014 it is worth noting for instance that the characteristic resistivity of sandstones ranges between 80 n m and 1200 n m while that of shales ranges between 1 n m and 150 n m porosity and tortuosity of fresh water bearing sandstones or shales can have an impact on the variation of resistivity de lima et al 2005 besides being a function of rock type resistivity is also a function of rock porosity hardness the chemistry of the fluid present and the degree of saturation or a combination of these factors geophysical resistivity techniques are based on the response of the earth to the flow of electrical current depending upon the survey geometry the apparent resistivity data are plotted as 1 d soundings 1 d profiles or in 2 d cross sections in order to look for anomalous regions cardimona 2002 in most porous rock systems ionic conduction by interstitial fluids and surface conduction at the interface between solid rock matrices and electrolytic solutions are responsible for a major part of the electric current flowing through a formation cardimona 2002 these measurements are obtained by introducing a direct current into the ground through a pair of electric current electrodes and measuring the electric potential difference between the electrodes teikeu et al 2012 4 3 2 types of electrical resistivity arrays electrical sounding in geophysical exploration can be used with many different techniques there are many electrode configurations in use such as schlumberger wenner pole dipole and dipole dipole and each have its advantages and disadvantages the schlumberger array was chosen for several reasons it is best used at many scattered sites within a large region where estimates of the thickness and resistivities of assumed horizontal layers are required and it has a moderate depth of investigation from various electrical methods the direct current dc resistivity method for conducting a vertical electrical sounding i e schlumberger sounding is effectively used for groundwater studies due to the simplicity of the technique easy interpretation and rugged nature of the associated instrumentation reynolds 1997 the expression for the geometric factor in the schlumberger array is k π m n a b 2 2 m n 2 2 δ v p i π m n a b 2 2 m n 2 2 ρ π a b 2 2 m n 2 2 m n δ v i where k is the geometric factor ab is the current electrode spacing mn is the potential electrode spacing δv is the measured potential difference and i is the current using the variables δv and i and the geometric factor k for the schlumberger array the apparent resistivity value can be calculated as shown in equation ρ k δ v i 4 3 3 vertical electrical sounding measurements electrical imaging survey using the schlumberger and dipole dipole fig 11 electrode configuration was carried out at site 1 33 530420 26 940260 with a spread of 350 m at electrode spacing of 10 m the inverse model resistivity is shown in fig 12 the spatial distribution of resistivities is ranging from 6 63 to 5755 ω m the resistivities at depths of 10 35 m are 2189 5755 ω m this could be attributed to the occurrence of fresh bedrock that is unweathered in between the zones of high resistivity there are low resistivity values at 120 and 210 m ranging between 120 and 317 ω m suggesting that it could be possible fault zones for groundwater accumulation at depths of 40 70 m the model show resistivity lows ranging from 6 63 to 317 ω m the surficial low resistive layer is likely to be weathered moist sandstone with clay material there is a possibility of fractured quartzite and sandstone occurrences as shown by low resistive gaps in between high resistive zones the high resistivities could be related to bedrock that has been unweathered such as a dolerite intrusion intermediate resistivity layers could be associated with partially weathered sandstone and quartzite based on the profile regions associated with fractures 110 and 120 m 200 and 230 m could be potential sites for borehole drilling electrical imaging survey was conducted using the schlumberger and dipole dipole electrode configuration at site 2 33 535160 26 955250 fig 13 the electrode spacing was 10 m and the total spread was up to 530 m measured apparent resistivity was analysed using res2dinv software the model resistivity section is shown in fig 14 the spatial distribution of resistivity is ranging from 15 9 to 1436 ω m the upper layer is characterised by resistivity values of 754 1436 ω m at depths of 5 20 m there are low resistive zones between resistive highs from depths of 35 70 m the profile is characterised by low resistive anomalies the bottom layer at site 2 is exhibits generally low resistive values that could be associated with deep weathering hence great for localisation of groundwater a low resistivity underlies the high resistivity tabular body the tabular body could be a dolerite sill overlying fractured sandstone and quartzite possibility of hosting some groundwater low resistivity values between large values could be an indication of a fault zone and large anomalies could be associated with a dolerite intrusion high resistive values could also indicate unweathered quartzite electrical imaging survey was conducted using the schlumberger and dipole dipole electrode at site 3 33 532290 26 940930 with a spread of 350 m and an electrode spacing of 10 m fig 15 the inverse resistivity section is shown in fig 16 the spatial distribution of resistivity is shown in fig 16 and the resistivity is ranging from 12 3 to 1012 ω m the section is characterised by the low to intermediate resistivity values the upper layer consists of lowest resistivity values at 290 m and depths of 30 m there is a resistive high which is likely to be a dolerite intrusion there are lower resistivities close to the high resistive zone suggesting that water can accumulate in the fractured zones of the dyke the central region of the section consists of intermediate values which could be associated with a fractured or weathered zone only site 1 was chosen a sample to show how resistivity curves resistivity curves for site 1 fig 17 and as well as for other sites were carried out using the schlumberger electrode configuration and the curves were interpreted using winresist software the geoelectrical parameters are given in table 5 the geoelectrical parameters have shown that there are three layers the second layer is characterised by generally fractured and weathered sandstone which are porous and enhance groundwater movement the third layer is characterised by high resistivities of 970 7 ω m table 5 5 discussion the lineament map is characterised by a dense distribution of lineaments majority of lineaments are located on lithologies of the witteberg sequences which are regions that have been induced to faulting and thrusting due to the cape fold belt presence of lineaments could possibly indicate the location of brittle deformation which could also be responsible for enhancing increased permeability and promoting groundwater localisation existing boreholes were overlaid on the lineaments and from the field investigations boreholes away from lineament zones have ceased to be productive there are zones of dense interconnection of lineaments in the study area these zones can be targeted for groundwater considerable numbers of wells can be found in localities of low lineaments however most of the wells would in this case be characterised by low or medium yield whereas high yield wells can be mainly found within zones of moderate to a high density of lineaments al bakri and al jahmany 2013 moreover enhanced permeability depends on the density of fractures fracture length aperture and connectivity singhal and gupta 2010 density of lineaments along with the degree of lineament intersection determines the anisotropy of groundwater flow in the fracture networks as in environments with a high degree of interconnection where groundwater flow is smoother and more uniform prabu and rajagopalan 2013 potential for hydro geomorphic units can be enhanced by joints fractures and their intersections raj et al 2012 lineaments provide a pathway for groundwater movement lineament density of an area can indirectly reveal the groundwater potential since the presence of lineaments denotes a permeable zone mahmoud and alazba 2015 the lineament density map in the area of study shows that lineaments are either moderately or densely concentrated in the southwestern part of ndlambe municipality while northeastern localities have a low density of lineaments densely lineated localities could be related to the occurrence of faults fracture zones and lithological contacts this means that more boreholes in the future could be drilled in the southwestern localities to increase groundwater resource availability in the ndlambe municipality as these regions are favourable for the accumulation of groundwater the orientation of lineaments was analysed using the rose diagram which indicated the predominant directions of the fractures showing thus the orientation of the preferential flow the rose diagram showed one prominent trend in the southwest northeast direction fig 6 this can therefore be an indication for the direction of groundwater movement in the study area this is quite contrasting from previous findings that have denoted that for the entire region of south africa the predominant orientation of lineaments are trending in a northwest southeast direction dovetailing the great compressional horizontal stress known as the wegener stress anomaly madi and zhao 2013 from bird et al 2006 andreoli et al 1996 fractured zones usually occur along lineaments trending in a given direction chuma et al 2013 secondary structures folds shear zones fractures and veins have the greatest effect on groundwater flow in the area of study reverse faulting in the study area can be considered favourable conditions for groundwater movement at a lesser extent because reverse faulting is synonymous of compressional environments faulting further results in significant fracturing of bedrock within the fault zone fracturing in turn increases the permeability of the bedrock allowing for greater groundwater flow and storage this complements petrographic analysis which helped discover microfractures that are planar and curviplanar these microfractures result from extensional stress and brittle deformation and thus generating secondary porosity and enhancing groundwater flow in sandstones sem micrograph quartz grains are affected by fracturing and are characterised by a dense network of microcracks borehole lithological columns further show that the subsurface area of study is fractured hence suggesting groundwater potential the findings corroborate results of chandra 2006 who suggested that horizontal and vertical fractures control deeper movement and direction of groundwater flow similarly fractured zones are highly productive with large storage potential pietersen et al 2011 electrical resistivity surveying methods have been widely used to determine the thickness and resistivity of layered media this is useful for the purpose of assessing groundwater potential and sitting boreholes in fractured unconfined aquifers muchingami et al 2012 vertical electrical sounding technique has been used successfully for locating the fractures and investigating the groundwater quality in different settings balakrishna et al 2014 resistivity surveys were conducted around the ndlambe municipality for the investigation of groundwater potential zones the resistivity sounding in the study area showed that the surficial low resistive layer is associated with moist sandstone and clay material clay materials on the surface inhibit infiltration of groundwater while promoting surface runoff hence few groundwater potential zones in areas dominated by a surficial clay layer low resistivities on the central section of the ert of the study area could be due to the presence of deep seated fractures acting as water conduits to the vadose zone muchingami et al 2012 low gaps in between high resistive zones suggest possible fault zones which could act as localities for groundwater seepage hence promoting groundwater localisation low resistivity gaps also suggest fractured quartzite and sandstone several isolated zones of low resistivity could probably be associated with saturated fractured zones of the weathered layer asry et al 2012 intermediate resistivity layers could be associated with partially weathered quartzite and sandstone fractures also act as conduits for groundwater localisation high resistivity values in the study area are associated with massive rock bodies of quartzite and unweathered sandstone fractures can also be consistent with the hydro geophysical study and the occurrence of groundwater will in this case be controlled by secondary porosity due to the presence of weathered fractures along the underlying bedrock martinelli and hubert 1985 weaver et al 1992 6 conclusions this study demonstrates the important contribution of the geological and geophysical techniques as effective tools for exploring groundwater potential zones in the ndlambe municipality and other areas where applicable the hydrogeological interpretation is proved by several agreements in particular the most evident agreements are as follows remote sensing data contributed to identifying promising sites for groundwater exploration the data showed that sites with possible high yields were related to moderate to high density of lineament intersection e g fig 18 it can also be inferred that most of the zones with low groundwater potentials are far away from lineaments the orientation of lineaments was analysed using the rose diagram which indicated the dominant directions of the fractures hence also showing the orientation of the preferential flow therefore remote sensing would be recommended for narrowing potential areas for groundwater exploration photographs and visual observations during field traverses have shown that the study area is characterised by the variation of groundwater potentials and highly productive zones in the area are associated with secondary structures folds fractures and veins fractures are responsible for increasing porosity of the bedrock allowing for greater groundwater flow and storage this complements petrographic analysis that showed many microfractures because of extensional stress and brittle deformation these microfractures generated secondary porosity thus enhancing groundwater flow this corroborates sem analysis that showed grain truncations and cobweb textures within areas dominated by mica and this is clear evidence of intense fracturing geophysical surveys have further shown zones of weaknesses which have been inferred as fault zones to be responsible for groundwater availability fractured zones by resistivity sounding indicate high potential zones for groundwater localisation low resistivity zones suggest highly fractured and faulted regions hence good for groundwater accumulation while high resistivities are associated with unweathered quartzite and igneous intrusions the study area comprises of highly fractured localities and this could be due to the tectonic movement because of multiple phases of deformations of the cape fold belt it is recommended that the ndlambe municipality be surveyed further by geological and geophysical methods magnetic and gravity methods to further understand the geohydrology of the area this can be coupled with porosity and density measurements to delineate groundwater potential zones for borehole drill sites studies should focus on the determination of aquifer hydraulic properties and recharge issues through geochemistry isotope studies this will assist the sustainable management of the aquifers in this era of climate change acknowledgements authors

12076,potentiality for groundwater in the ndlambe municipality comprising of rocks of the witteberg group cape supergroup was investigated using a combination of different approaches distribution of lineaments extracted from a satellite image is hardly homogenous their density varies with different localities areas around the western and southwestern parts of the study area have relatively high density values 39 while the northern eastern and northeastern parts of the area of study are dominated by low density values 0 39 boreholes located in the northeastern part appear to be away from the zones of dense lineaments have dried up and were found not to be productive in the northwest parts of the study area there are several locations displaying intersections of lineaments these zones of high lineament intersection can be targeted for groundwater exploration most of the lineaments in the study area trend in a northeast southwest direction this trend would be identical to the orientation of the preferential flow path quartz veins and normal faults seen in the field are good indicators for groundwater potential as they are a structural expression of extensional environmentsthe same applies to quartz grains affected by extensional micro fractures which resulted from brittle deformation as seen under the microscope subsurface geology investigation from borehole logging has depicted fractures in quartzitic sandstones thus micro fractures in quartz grains and quartzitic sandstones enhance secondary porosity and groundwater flow low resistivities from the geophysical investigation in the study area were inferred to be weathered moist sandstone the low resistivities at depth also indicate an overlying zone of fractured sandstone and quartzite hence possibility of hosting some groundwater low resistivity zones between two large bodies suggest that the massive rock bodies are being weathered and fractured and fractures act as conduits for groundwater graphical abstract image 1 keywords remote sensing lineaments resistivity groundwater borehole 1 introduction the ndlambe municipality is part of the cacadu district eastern cape province south africa fig 1 the eastern cape like other many provinces faces the challenge of groundwater scarcity in 2018 the city of cape town was expecting what was known as day zero a day when taps in the city run dry and people start queuing for water the eastern cape province has for instance virtually no groundwater can be found in most of the aquifers dept of water affairs forestry 2002 there are already problems of supply and quality regarding water provision with an estimated eight million south africans currently having no access to potable water eberhrd and pegram 2000 one third of all households in south africa lack access to basic water services with the majority of these being located in rural areas these historical inequalities have led to a sound policy of investment of infrastructures for these households the cost of water will also increase as larger schemes are required to transfer available water to urban centers where the greatest growth in demand is likely to occur unless proactive strategic measures are taken to address this water shortage the macroeconomic impact of water scarcity may have a crippling effect on south africa s ability to meet the development requirements of its people there has also been an associated decrease in water quality associated with both point source effluent discharge and diffuse impacts from land use wash off the increased interest in recent years in underground sources of water has led to a need for more intensive studies of the geometry and properties of aquifers asry et al 2012 this is because over half of the world s population depends on groundwater for drinkingaasst1 water supplies for instance in the united kingdom about 30 of the public water supplies are derived from groundwater in the united states of america about 50 denmark 99 tebbuth 1998 and german 70 in terms of south africa s overall water consumption groundwater contributes only some 15 of the total volume consumed dept of water affairs forestry 2002 groundwater resource assessments and sustainability considerations are of utmost importance in the arid and semiarid regions where water is commonly of critical economic and social significance most countries located within the arid and semi arid regions like south africa are categorized as water stressed basson and van rooven 1998 and depend primarily on groundwater as the water supply for various developmental activities therefore understanding the nature of groundwater circulation and characteristics of the aquifer is crucial for sustainable development of the country s water resources the most recent scientific estimates place groundwater in south africa in the same league volumetrically as our stored surface water resources the total volume of available renewable groundwater in south africa the utilisable groundwater exploitation potential or ugep is 10 343 million m³ a or 7500 million m³ a under drought conditions vegter 2006 the eastern cape is one of the provinces faced with the challenge of supplying clean fresh water to the communities residing in it drilling and finding productive boreholes in the karoo aquifers is not always an easy task madi and zhao 2013 thus more studies need to be done to alleviate such problems ndlambe municipality is a case in point where the population is greatly dependent on groundwater resources for both domestic and agricultural activities farming forms the brunt of the economic activities of this region the aquifer types are mapped as fractured with a low to fairly high development potential and the higher yielding areas are structurally controlled baron et al 1998 over 80 of south africa is underlain by relatively low yielding shallow weathered and or fractured rock aquifer systems vegter 2001 by contrast appreciable quantities of groundwater can be abstracted at relatively high rates from dolomitic and quartzitic aquifer systems located in the northern and southern parts of the country respectively as well as from a number of primary aquifers situated along the coastline vegter 2001 of which port alfred is located in addition few studies have been undertaken to evaluate groundwater resource in the area of port alfred this lack of information could hinder efficient and prudent groundwater development a thorough study to characterize the groundwater flow system and determine aquifer systems in the area is needed to address these gaps in the study area this study therefore is an attempt to evaluate the groundwater resource as a way of achieving the goal of water sustainability 2 regional geology ndlambe municipality fig 2 and fig 3 is geologically setting within the cape fold belt which extends across the southern tip of africa between latitudes 31 and 35 south and longitudes 18 and 27 east fig 3 few rocks of the dwyka group diamictite crops out nearby the cape fold belt extends for approximately 1300 km along the southern part of the south african coastal margin tankard et al 2009 where predominantly meta sedimentary rocks of late proterozoic pre cape palaeozoic cape supergroup and mesozoic karoo supergroup age outcrop and define two arms the main southern arm has an east west trend and the north northwesterly trending arm forms the western part of the fold belt de beer 1992 arenaceous and argillaceous sediments of the cape supergroup were deposited in a wedge shaped sedimentary prism on a passive margin during ordovician to permian times in response to negative tectonic inversion of saldanian province basement rocks tankard et al 1982 broquet 1992 cole 1992 shone and booth 2005 thamm and johnson 2006 stratigraphically the cape supergroup comprises the table mountain group at the base overlain by the bokkeveld group and the latter in turn by the witteberg group table 1 the total apparent thickness of this package is some 10 000 m johnson et al 2006 the table mountain group which makes up the mountainous terrain everywhere is composed of mainly clean quartzites and lesser proportions of shales with only one prominent argillaceous formation the cedarberg shale formation in contrast the bokkeveld group makes up subdued rolling hill topography and is composed of predominantly black shale with lesser dark coloured quartzites the witteberg group has about equal proportions of quartzite and shale pre cape rocks composed of schists gneisses quartzites and metamorphosed carbonates occur mainly along the coastal regions of the western cape and as inliers within the cape fold belt and form the basement to the cape supergroup barnett et al 1997 le roux 1998 these rocks yield dates varying between 560 and 1100 ma armstrong et al 1998 gresse et al 2006 and are interpreted as shallow marine clastic and chemical sediments which were deformed and metamorphosed during the late proterozoic saldanian orogeny halbich 1992 gresse et al 2006 frimmel et al 2001 pre cape rocks as well as cape and overlying karoo supergroups were deformed during the cape orogeny which comprised four main paroxysms from the late palaeozoic to early mesozoic halbich 1983 the cape supergroup overlies basement rocks composed of schist gneisses and carbonates occurring as inliers in the cape fold belt and in turn is overlain by glacial turbidite and terrestrial deposits and basaltic lavas of the karoo supergroup halbich 1983 2 1 stratigraphy the palaeozoic cape supergroup is divided into three groups table mountain bokkeveld and witteberg tables 1 3 comprising rocks of clastic origin derived from a northern provenance area and deposited in a continental shelf setting tankard et al 1982 broquet 1992 tankard et al 2009 proposed that the environment of deposition changed from shallow marine and terrestrial with minor glacial interludes in the table mountain group to a deltaic and shallow marine shelf setting bokkeveld and witteberg groups rocks of the bokkeveld group are composed of an upper mainly argillaceous sequence and a lower sequence of argillaceous and arenaceous rocks these rocks were deposited conformably on those of the table mountain group in a transgressive regressive setting and this setting reflects a history of greater tectonic control in the deposition of sediments than in table mountain group times rust 1973 the witteberg group occurs as the northernmost outcrop of the cape supergroup and is composed of approximately equal proportions of sandstone and shale table 1 with a diamictite horizon near the top of the sequence the karoo supergroup that unconformably overlies the cape supergroup has a basal sequence of extensive tillite deposits of the dwyka formation overlying the dwyka formation are shallow marine deposits followed conformably by a thick sequence of terrestrial deposits and capped by a succession of volcanic rocks tankard et al 1982 the latter rocks occur as a large erosional remnant in the central eastern part of south africa forming the highest mountains in the country 3 material and methods 3 1 remote sensing remote sensing was used to map lineaments as this has an immense importance on hard rock hydrogeology as it can identify rock fractures khodaei and nassery 2011 mukherjee 2008 adewumi and anifowose 2017 acharya et al 2017 https www tandfonline com author waters 2c pauline waters et al 1990 solomon 2003 that could be groundwater localizers remote sensing was used in order to depict zones of high density surface lineaments for groundwater targets the regional fracture pattern was assessed by tracing of lineaments from 1 100000 scale black and white prints spectral band 5 landsat satellite photographs satellite images landsat 4 5 tm were chosen because they offer good scenes that can be exploited from remote sensing in order to extract linear features lineaments almost uniquely coincide with structural bedrock features related to increased frequencies of joints shear fractures and smaller faults and layers and lenses of faulted rocks the mapping of lineaments was done manually through the use of arcgis 10 2 software the first stage was downloading the digital elevation model a 30 m level 1 dem produced by the united states geologic survey usgs interpolated from topography was used for the purpose of this study it was loaded onto the software where the hillshade feature was applied to refine the data the following characteristics were used as guides for identifying lineaments on the imagery landform expressions linear ridges or valleys aligned saddles or breaks in slope cross drainage alignments drainage pattern expressions linear or aligned streams or stream segments abrupt irregular changes in stream direction abrupt changes in vegetation characteristics indicating a natural boundary change in surface characteristics or vegetation community composition also linear vegetation patterns changes in surface texture or patterns expressed on imagery indicating a change in surface subsurface characteristics on completion of the mapping of the lineaments they were together with existing boreholes overlain on the geology map of the area as well as in the area the lineament shapefile was exported into cad to construct a rose diagram using rockworks software that produced the major trend of digitized lineaments 3 2 geological observations the geological investigation was done in and around the ndlambe municipality in order to look at the rock types that crop out and associated structural deformations quartzites sandstones siltstones and shales are the main outcrops found in the area they were affected by folding and faulting normal and reverse and as well as veins which are fractures filled with mineral crystals that precipitated from watery solution mostly quartz veins are prominent and indicate hydrothermal activity rock samples were collected in the field for microscopic studies transmitted light and scanning electron microscopy in order to depict the deformational structures that can be indicative of secondary permeability which can be favourable for groundwater flow for scanning electron microscopy quartzite sandstone and siltstone samples were cut into small slabs and were prepared at the department of geology university of stellenbosch the equipment used for sem at stellenbosch is the zeiss evo ma15vp which is equipped with a backscattered electron detector bsd the sem function generally focuses a beam of electrons which interact with the atoms in the sample generating signals that provide information about the surface morphology texture crystalline structure and orientation of materials within the sample 3 3 subsurface lithology aquifers can be identified through detailed hydrogeological surveys using surface and subsurface geological methods four borehole logs were used for understanding the subsurface and identifying rock properties subsurface lithology plays an important role in delineating subsurface structures estimating aquifer depths and groundwater distribution analysis of borehole log data was done by sedlog 3 1 software and microsoft power point therefore conducting sub surface lithology investigations in the study area is important to delineate the depth of viable aquifers for sustainable water supply 3 4 geophysical surveys the major objective of geophysics applied to hydrogeology is to deliver parameters and subsurface models which are helpful for the decision making process in groundwater exploration and groundwater protection geophysical investigations also provide excellent vertical profile information on the lithology flow components structure permeability porosity and water quality of the groundwater system the application of geophysical methods is indispensable as it reduces the trial and error technique that has been used where many boreholes had to be drilled to strike the target as such they are more dependable and precise methods of groundwater search than any other in the sub surface structural investigation electrical resistivity was applied to the study area for the electrical resistivity technique vertical electrical sounding ves and electrical resistivity profiling erp were carried out at chosen sites in order to obtain the geoelectric parameters of the subsurface that can be linked to the physical properties of the aquifer the drilling of boreholes for the purpose of obtaining subsurface information is usually expensive and time consuming the use of electrical resistivity surveys provides a relatively inexpensive and rapid alternative to obtaining such data many other researchers have used electrical resistivity to explore for groundwater mohamaden and ehab 2017 riwayat et al 2018 https onlinelibrary wiley com action dosearch contribauthorstored limaye 2c shrikant daji limaye 2016 mohamadenhamouda and mansour 2016 fieldwork was done between the period of february and march 2018 the schlumberger configuration which is efficient in the exploration of groundwater hassan et al 2017 vasantrao et al 2017 was used to determine the apparent resistivity two resistivity instruments were used to conduct the survey geotron resistivity meter model g41 and the syscal pro resistivity meter geotron resistivity meter model g41 and its accessories cables steel electrodes hammers and gps was used to produce apparent resistivity pseudosections calculated apparent resistivity and the inverse model resistivity through the use of geotron resistivity meter two potential and two current electrodes were placed along a straight line the array being symmetrical around the middle point 0 current electrodes were placed at a and b and potential electrodes placed at m and n the distance between the potential electrodes mn was kept much smaller than the distance between the current electrodes ab the distance between the current electrodes was increased from a minimum ab 2 of 1 5 m to a maximum of 100 m current electrode spacing was chosen such that there were six logarithmically spacing resulting in ab spacing equals to 1 5 2 3 5 7 10 15 20 30 50 70 100 m as the current electrode spacing increases the potential signal decreases therefore half the potential electrode spacing mn 2 was increased by increasing the current electrode spacing the current penetrates deeper into the earth and information is received on resistivity at greater depths the vertical electrical soundings were done on four locations around port alfred area some sounding stations were measured nearby the existing wells to parameterize the geoelectrical measurements in view of the lithological succession layers thickness and depth to the water bearing layers well information was used to control the interpretation of the field data the interpretation process is based preliminary on a model using the available geological and hydrological information beside well data the syscal pro resistivity meter combines transmitter and receiver in a single module powered by a 12 v battery and whose specifications include output voltage up to 1000 v the syscal pro is multichannel equipment which allows multiple potential dipoles to be used simultaneously to obtain the resistivity measurements the dipole dipole arrangement allows fairly quick data acquisition and enables studying the lateral variation of a given physical parameter at different depths this arrangement has the current ab and the potential mn dipoles which are most commonly placed linearly on the ground the spacing between a and b is equal to the spacing between m and n both of which remain unchanged during data acquisition the measurements are plotted at the intersection of lines starting from the centers of the current and voltage dipoles and form a 45 degree angle with the horizontal mello et al 2014 three lines of investigation were performed in the area of study line 1 was 320 m long line 2 was 480 m long line 3 was 320 m calculated apparent resistivity values for each sounding produced by the geotron resistivity meter were plotted against half current electrode separation ab 2 on a log log graph the acquired vertical electrical sounding data was presented as sounding curves the curves were quantitatively interpreted by partial curve matching using three layer model curves and corresponding auxiliary curves theoretical vertical electrical sounding curves were generated from the partial curve matching interpretation results using the win resist computer programme data collected by the two instruments were processed using the res2dinv software this software adopts a rapid technique for inverting apparent resistivity data into actual resistivity which is much more useful for geological interpretation theoretically it produces a subsurface geoelectrical 2 d model free of the distortions from the pseudo sections of apparent resistivity caused by the geometry array used mello et al 2014 some sounding stations were measured nearby the existing wells to parameterize the geoelectrical measurements in view of the lithological succession layers thickness and depth to water bearing layers well information was used to control the interpretation of the field data the interpretation process is based preliminary on a model using the available geological and hydrological information beside well data 4 results 4 1 remote sensing lineaments were mapped and analysed using the rose diagram lineament density and lineament frequency parameters the results of the analysis are presented as the lineament map lineament density map and rose diagram the lineament map shows that lineament distribution is hardly homogenous fig 4 the type of lineaments identified has in many cases shown to indicate the location of brittle deformation the majority of the fractures are located on lithologies that are of the witteberg sequences which are regions that have been induced to faulting and thrusting in some cases however the lineaments are related to geological structures other than brittle deformation such as ductile deformation lithological changes and alterations that are unrelated to structures in the rock johan and mats 2007 the lineament density variation map fig 5 shows the lineament numbers to be varying at different localities the denser lineaments could possibly represent regions that are mostly dominated by quartzite of the witteberg group areas around the western and southwestern parts of the study area have relatively high density values 39 while the northern eastern and northeastern parts of the area of study are dominated by low density values 0 39 the zones of relatively high lineament density are identified as zones of high degree of rock fracturing which are prerequisite for groundwater conduit development in an area edet et al 1998 in the north west parts of the study area there are several locations where there are intersections of lineaments lineament intersection provides an interpretation of hidden subsurface tectonic configuration in the form of linear feature intersection cross cutting geological structures which are indicators of deep seated fracture fault medium mogaji1 et al 2011 therefore zones of high lineament intersection over the study area are feasible zones for groundwater targeting in the study area fig 4 clearly shows the distribution of boreholes in relation to the lineaments most of the borehole sites specifically in the northeastern parts are away from the lineaments according to internal studies that have been made concerning water level measurement by the department of water services several boreholes have dried up in the northeastern parts which correlate with regions that have low density distribution of lineaments this suggests that in the future more boreholes could be drilled in the southwestern parts of the study as these areas are characterized by high lineament density hence potential zones for groundwater the orientation of the lineaments is analysed by constructing a rose diagram which clearly shows the azimuthal distribution of the data fig 6 even though these diagrams are not length weighted they can indicate on each occasion what the most dominant directions of the fractures are this analysis is very critical for the study of groundwater flow as in most cases the orientation of the fractures is identical to the orientation of the preferential flow path pothiraj and baskaran 2013 the rose diagram of the detected lineaments shows two prominent trends in the directions of northeast and southwest axes a comparison with fig 4 shows that the prominent lineament trends are correlated with high density variation of the study area this can be an indication of the direction of groundwater movement in the study area most of the lineaments that clusters the south west part of the region are s 210 285 w trending lineaments whereas in the north east part of the region lineaments tend to cluster in n 38 85 e direction these findings correlate that of de wit and ransome 1992 who suggested that the cape fold belt has been subjected to episodes of compression and extension that led to intense shortening of the rock body besides deformation was more intense in the southern domain of the cape fold belt and this domain is characterised by east west trending and north verging folds and faults de beer 1995 the predominant orientation of lineaments as seen in the rose diagram fig 6 is quite contrasting with the ones highlighted by madi and zhao 2013 4 2 geological investigations some outcrops were found in the ndlambe municipality in and around the town of port alfred evidence of tectonic movements folding faulting overturned beds etc were noted during field investigations fig 7 a and b show a faulted zone in fig 7 a one can see horizontal beds of siltstone adjacent to vertical beds of the same siltstone fig 7 b it is worth noting that such a normal fault with a dip angle of 90 indicates extensional tectonics and accordingly good indication for structural deformation that can be considered for groundwater flow according to anderson s theory of faulting sigma 1 is vertical while sigma 2 and sigma 3 are horizontal fig 7 c shows an unconformity acting as an erosional surface that marks an angular discordance with sedimentation units that were deposited in two phases the first unit has vertical beds of quartzitic sandstones which were previously horizontal and were undoubtedly overturned during the cape orogeny to become vertical after the tectonic movement a long period elapsed and a channel started flowing and eroding the overturned bed depositing some quartzite pebbles that were set on top of the erosional surface the quartzite pebbles are roundish and very resistant this is indicative of a very long distance of transportation the channel continued flowing and deposited sandstone bed that can be seen on top of the erosional surface a reverse fault fig 7 d that cut across some weathered sandstones with non systematic joints was found at another place the hanging wall and the footwall above and below the reverse fault respectively has shattered sandstones with non systematic joints systematic joints are good for stress inversion methodologies e g delvaux and sperner 2003 to infer the orientation of the stress field in a given area whereas non systematic joints are good for engineering geology and groundwater flow pluijm and marshak 2004 according to anderson theory of faulting reverse faulting is a response to an applied vertical sigma 3 while sigma 1 and sigma 2 are horizontal the occurrence of normal faulting and reverse faulting in the same area is indicative contrasting tectonics at two different periods since a normal and reverse fault cannot derive from the same tectonic event at another location some carbonaceous shales crop out they underwent shear movement and were overturned occurring now in a monocline like structure one can see the schistose texture within them fig 7 f indicative of regional metamorphism shale slate phyllite schist these carbonaceous shales probably developed in a lagoon in which the mud might have mixed with organic material hydrothermal activity has never been reported in the area of port alfred which is located some 60 km southeast of grahamstown for the first time it was highlighted the occurrence of hydrothermal quartz veins which play an important role in the formation of kaolin by acting as impermeable barriers in trapping the water that leads to weathering of the dwyka tillite madi and zhao 2011 blocky quartz veins fig 7 e occurring in weathered sandstones can be seen in some areas of port alfred ndlambe municipality blocky veins means that the vein was an open cavity when the mineral precipitated and this can only be possible if veins formed near the surface where rock strength is sufficient to permit a cavity to stay open or fluid pressure is great enough to hold the fracture open van der pluijm and marshak 2004 the presence of hydrothermal quartz veins indicate extensional movements in the area analysis of quartzitic sandstone fig 8 a showed that it consists of coarse monocrystalline grains which may have resulted from the enrichment of nonundulatory quartz the quartzite derived from quartz arenite due to the effect of high pressure and temperatures this quartzite has a lot of microfractures mostly planar and few of them are curviplanar fig 8 a and b these mode i microfractures result from extensional stress σ3 which act perpendicular to them anders et al 2014 and thus generating secondary porosity and enhancing groundwater flow there is very little mica and more quartz fine grained quartz has acted as a cement in between quartz grains some of the cracks have been filled by secondary minerals like muscovite the thin section in fig 8 c shows a fine grained quartz arenite of the cape supergroup the quartz arenite shows some fractures filled with muscovite fig 8 c and d quartz veins record a plastic deformation as they are mostly elongated fractures in the rock and plastic deformation as seen in the quartz grains are typical of a frictional plastic transitional zone plastic deformation in quartz starts occurring at a temperature of 350 c the occurrence of muscovite seen within the fractures was also confirmed through scanning electron microscopic analysis fig 8 d in this figure the mica is seen within a fractured quartz grain the fractures seen in the quartz grains are very important as they play a role in the flow of groundwater acting as structures for secondary permeability 4 2 1 subsurface lithology four borehole logs data provided by srk consulting were used for understanding the subsurface identifying properties of rocks and geologic interpretation borehole logs have been used for the purpose of this study to characterize lithology permeability and flow conditions in the area of port alfred analysis of borehole log data is done by sedlog 3 1 software and microsoft power point the four boreholes are identified as ec p40 162 ec p40 158 ec p40 002 and ec p40 160 fig 9 a shows a borehole lithological column with a total depth of 149 m the stratigraphy established from the lithological log shows three lithological units shale quartzitic sandstone and diamictite the top layer consists of weathered quartzitic sandstone with a depth of 3 m due to weathering this enhances permeability and allows groundwater movement at depths of 3 m up to 35 m the column is characterised with quartzitic sandstone that is unweathered suggesting that the region is characterised with low groundwater localisation with an increase in depth there is an alteration of quartzitic sandstone and shale high thickness of clay at 75 m impedes groundwater movement at depths of 80 m to 115 m there is fractured quartzitic sandstone which is highly permeable this zone is confined by two non porous layers of shale which makes it a good aquifer fig 9 b shows a borehole lithological column with a total depth of 169 m the stratigraphy established from the lithological log shows two lithological units quarzitic sandstone and shale the top layer comprises of clay sand clay sand is highly porous therefore enhances infiltration of water promoting groundwater availability below the clay sand there is a highly weathered zone of 14 m which could be highly permeable and favourable for groundwater the lithological column is further characterised by the alteration of fractured quartzitic sandstone and shale at depths between 93 and 144 m the zone is characterised by fractured quartzitic sandstone and shale fractured shale further promotes infiltration of water and groundwater flow is enhanced with increase in depth the lithological column is characterised by an impermeable layer of shale with a thickness of 14 m and this zone impedes the further movement of groundwater fig 10 a shows a borehole lithological column with a total depth of 146 m the stratigraphy established from the lithological log shows two lithological units quartzitic sandstone and shale the top layer is characterised by dry clay with a depth of 4 m below the dry clay zone is shale layer with a thickness of 26 m high thickness of clay acts as an aquitard which impedes groundwater recharging and increases runoff during the rainy season with the increase in depth there is fractured quartzitic sandstone which could be inferred as a permeable zone for groundwater localisation generally the lithological column has a low potential zone for groundwater as the bedrock is slightly weathered fig 10 b shows a borehole lithological column with a total depth of 120 m the stratigraphy established from the lithological log shows three lithological units quartzitic sandstone sandstone and dolerite the top layer is clay sand with a thickness of 3 m followed by weathered sandstone at depths between 3 m and 25 m fractured quartzitic sandstone is ranging from depths of 25 m 79 m this could be inferred to be an aquifer zone for groundwater localisation this is further favoured by fractured dolerite at depths of 79 120 m and it is good for groundwater channels due to its fractured nature it can be considered a good permeable conduit for groundwater the fracturing of bedrock formations is as a result of structural deformation summary of the field well data for the 4 selected boreholes can be seen in table 4 the pumping test indicated that there was a numerous water strikes during drilling the water strikes points to an obvious occurrence of water reservoirs which can be related to the potentiality of groundwater in the area of port alfred 4 3 geophysical survey 4 3 1 overview on resistivity data collected by the geophysical equipment were processed using the res2dinv software this software adopts a rapid technique for inverting apparent resistivity data into actual resistivity which is much more useful for geological interpretation theoretically it produces a subsurface geoelectrical 2 d model free of the distortions from the pseudo sections of apparent resistivity caused by the geometry array used mello et al 2014 for the electrical resistivity technique vertical electrical sounding ves was carried out at chosen sites in order to obtain the geoelectric parameters of the subsurface that can be linked to the physical properties of the aquifer the vertical electrical soundings carried out on four locations around port alfred area some sounding stations the concept of resistivity is based on ohm s law which states that r v i resistivity can be mathematically defined as ρ r a l where r resistance ω vpotential difference v icurrent strength amps ρ resistivity a area m l length m each lithological unit has a characteristic range of resistivity haque et al 2015 dominika stan and stan kłeczek 2014 it is worth noting for instance that the characteristic resistivity of sandstones ranges between 80 n m and 1200 n m while that of shales ranges between 1 n m and 150 n m porosity and tortuosity of fresh water bearing sandstones or shales can have an impact on the variation of resistivity de lima et al 2005 besides being a function of rock type resistivity is also a function of rock porosity hardness the chemistry of the fluid present and the degree of saturation or a combination of these factors geophysical resistivity techniques are based on the response of the earth to the flow of electrical current depending upon the survey geometry the apparent resistivity data are plotted as 1 d soundings 1 d profiles or in 2 d cross sections in order to look for anomalous regions cardimona 2002 in most porous rock systems ionic conduction by interstitial fluids and surface conduction at the interface between solid rock matrices and electrolytic solutions are responsible for a major part of the electric current flowing through a formation cardimona 2002 these measurements are obtained by introducing a direct current into the ground through a pair of electric current electrodes and measuring the electric potential difference between the electrodes teikeu et al 2012 4 3 2 types of electrical resistivity arrays electrical sounding in geophysical exploration can be used with many different techniques there are many electrode configurations in use such as schlumberger wenner pole dipole and dipole dipole and each have its advantages and disadvantages the schlumberger array was chosen for several reasons it is best used at many scattered sites within a large region where estimates of the thickness and resistivities of assumed horizontal layers are required and it has a moderate depth of investigation from various electrical methods the direct current dc resistivity method for conducting a vertical electrical sounding i e schlumberger sounding is effectively used for groundwater studies due to the simplicity of the technique easy interpretation and rugged nature of the associated instrumentation reynolds 1997 the expression for the geometric factor in the schlumberger array is k π m n a b 2 2 m n 2 2 δ v p i π m n a b 2 2 m n 2 2 ρ π a b 2 2 m n 2 2 m n δ v i where k is the geometric factor ab is the current electrode spacing mn is the potential electrode spacing δv is the measured potential difference and i is the current using the variables δv and i and the geometric factor k for the schlumberger array the apparent resistivity value can be calculated as shown in equation ρ k δ v i 4 3 3 vertical electrical sounding measurements electrical imaging survey using the schlumberger and dipole dipole fig 11 electrode configuration was carried out at site 1 33 530420 26 940260 with a spread of 350 m at electrode spacing of 10 m the inverse model resistivity is shown in fig 12 the spatial distribution of resistivities is ranging from 6 63 to 5755 ω m the resistivities at depths of 10 35 m are 2189 5755 ω m this could be attributed to the occurrence of fresh bedrock that is unweathered in between the zones of high resistivity there are low resistivity values at 120 and 210 m ranging between 120 and 317 ω m suggesting that it could be possible fault zones for groundwater accumulation at depths of 40 70 m the model show resistivity lows ranging from 6 63 to 317 ω m the surficial low resistive layer is likely to be weathered moist sandstone with clay material there is a possibility of fractured quartzite and sandstone occurrences as shown by low resistive gaps in between high resistive zones the high resistivities could be related to bedrock that has been unweathered such as a dolerite intrusion intermediate resistivity layers could be associated with partially weathered sandstone and quartzite based on the profile regions associated with fractures 110 and 120 m 200 and 230 m could be potential sites for borehole drilling electrical imaging survey was conducted using the schlumberger and dipole dipole electrode configuration at site 2 33 535160 26 955250 fig 13 the electrode spacing was 10 m and the total spread was up to 530 m measured apparent resistivity was analysed using res2dinv software the model resistivity section is shown in fig 14 the spatial distribution of resistivity is ranging from 15 9 to 1436 ω m the upper layer is characterised by resistivity values of 754 1436 ω m at depths of 5 20 m there are low resistive zones between resistive highs from depths of 35 70 m the profile is characterised by low resistive anomalies the bottom layer at site 2 is exhibits generally low resistive values that could be associated with deep weathering hence great for localisation of groundwater a low resistivity underlies the high resistivity tabular body the tabular body could be a dolerite sill overlying fractured sandstone and quartzite possibility of hosting some groundwater low resistivity values between large values could be an indication of a fault zone and large anomalies could be associated with a dolerite intrusion high resistive values could also indicate unweathered quartzite electrical imaging survey was conducted using the schlumberger and dipole dipole electrode at site 3 33 532290 26 940930 with a spread of 350 m and an electrode spacing of 10 m fig 15 the inverse resistivity section is shown in fig 16 the spatial distribution of resistivity is shown in fig 16 and the resistivity is ranging from 12 3 to 1012 ω m the section is characterised by the low to intermediate resistivity values the upper layer consists of lowest resistivity values at 290 m and depths of 30 m there is a resistive high which is likely to be a dolerite intrusion there are lower resistivities close to the high resistive zone suggesting that water can accumulate in the fractured zones of the dyke the central region of the section consists of intermediate values which could be associated with a fractured or weathered zone only site 1 was chosen a sample to show how resistivity curves resistivity curves for site 1 fig 17 and as well as for other sites were carried out using the schlumberger electrode configuration and the curves were interpreted using winresist software the geoelectrical parameters are given in table 5 the geoelectrical parameters have shown that there are three layers the second layer is characterised by generally fractured and weathered sandstone which are porous and enhance groundwater movement the third layer is characterised by high resistivities of 970 7 ω m table 5 5 discussion the lineament map is characterised by a dense distribution of lineaments majority of lineaments are located on lithologies of the witteberg sequences which are regions that have been induced to faulting and thrusting due to the cape fold belt presence of lineaments could possibly indicate the location of brittle deformation which could also be responsible for enhancing increased permeability and promoting groundwater localisation existing boreholes were overlaid on the lineaments and from the field investigations boreholes away from lineament zones have ceased to be productive there are zones of dense interconnection of lineaments in the study area these zones can be targeted for groundwater considerable numbers of wells can be found in localities of low lineaments however most of the wells would in this case be characterised by low or medium yield whereas high yield wells can be mainly found within zones of moderate to a high density of lineaments al bakri and al jahmany 2013 moreover enhanced permeability depends on the density of fractures fracture length aperture and connectivity singhal and gupta 2010 density of lineaments along with the degree of lineament intersection determines the anisotropy of groundwater flow in the fracture networks as in environments with a high degree of interconnection where groundwater flow is smoother and more uniform prabu and rajagopalan 2013 potential for hydro geomorphic units can be enhanced by joints fractures and their intersections raj et al 2012 lineaments provide a pathway for groundwater movement lineament density of an area can indirectly reveal the groundwater potential since the presence of lineaments denotes a permeable zone mahmoud and alazba 2015 the lineament density map in the area of study shows that lineaments are either moderately or densely concentrated in the southwestern part of ndlambe municipality while northeastern localities have a low density of lineaments densely lineated localities could be related to the occurrence of faults fracture zones and lithological contacts this means that more boreholes in the future could be drilled in the southwestern localities to increase groundwater resource availability in the ndlambe municipality as these regions are favourable for the accumulation of groundwater the orientation of lineaments was analysed using the rose diagram which indicated the predominant directions of the fractures showing thus the orientation of the preferential flow the rose diagram showed one prominent trend in the southwest northeast direction fig 6 this can therefore be an indication for the direction of groundwater movement in the study area this is quite contrasting from previous findings that have denoted that for the entire region of south africa the predominant orientation of lineaments are trending in a northwest southeast direction dovetailing the great compressional horizontal stress known as the wegener stress anomaly madi and zhao 2013 from bird et al 2006 andreoli et al 1996 fractured zones usually occur along lineaments trending in a given direction chuma et al 2013 secondary structures folds shear zones fractures and veins have the greatest effect on groundwater flow in the area of study reverse faulting in the study area can be considered favourable conditions for groundwater movement at a lesser extent because reverse faulting is synonymous of compressional environments faulting further results in significant fracturing of bedrock within the fault zone fracturing in turn increases the permeability of the bedrock allowing for greater groundwater flow and storage this complements petrographic analysis which helped discover microfractures that are planar and curviplanar these microfractures result from extensional stress and brittle deformation and thus generating secondary porosity and enhancing groundwater flow in sandstones sem micrograph quartz grains are affected by fracturing and are characterised by a dense network of microcracks borehole lithological columns further show that the subsurface area of study is fractured hence suggesting groundwater potential the findings corroborate results of chandra 2006 who suggested that horizontal and vertical fractures control deeper movement and direction of groundwater flow similarly fractured zones are highly productive with large storage potential pietersen et al 2011 electrical resistivity surveying methods have been widely used to determine the thickness and resistivity of layered media this is useful for the purpose of assessing groundwater potential and sitting boreholes in fractured unconfined aquifers muchingami et al 2012 vertical electrical sounding technique has been used successfully for locating the fractures and investigating the groundwater quality in different settings balakrishna et al 2014 resistivity surveys were conducted around the ndlambe municipality for the investigation of groundwater potential zones the resistivity sounding in the study area showed that the surficial low resistive layer is associated with moist sandstone and clay material clay materials on the surface inhibit infiltration of groundwater while promoting surface runoff hence few groundwater potential zones in areas dominated by a surficial clay layer low resistivities on the central section of the ert of the study area could be due to the presence of deep seated fractures acting as water conduits to the vadose zone muchingami et al 2012 low gaps in between high resistive zones suggest possible fault zones which could act as localities for groundwater seepage hence promoting groundwater localisation low resistivity gaps also suggest fractured quartzite and sandstone several isolated zones of low resistivity could probably be associated with saturated fractured zones of the weathered layer asry et al 2012 intermediate resistivity layers could be associated with partially weathered quartzite and sandstone fractures also act as conduits for groundwater localisation high resistivity values in the study area are associated with massive rock bodies of quartzite and unweathered sandstone fractures can also be consistent with the hydro geophysical study and the occurrence of groundwater will in this case be controlled by secondary porosity due to the presence of weathered fractures along the underlying bedrock martinelli and hubert 1985 weaver et al 1992 6 conclusions this study demonstrates the important contribution of the geological and geophysical techniques as effective tools for exploring groundwater potential zones in the ndlambe municipality and other areas where applicable the hydrogeological interpretation is proved by several agreements in particular the most evident agreements are as follows remote sensing data contributed to identifying promising sites for groundwater exploration the data showed that sites with possible high yields were related to moderate to high density of lineament intersection e g fig 18 it can also be inferred that most of the zones with low groundwater potentials are far away from lineaments the orientation of lineaments was analysed using the rose diagram which indicated the dominant directions of the fractures hence also showing the orientation of the preferential flow therefore remote sensing would be recommended for narrowing potential areas for groundwater exploration photographs and visual observations during field traverses have shown that the study area is characterised by the variation of groundwater potentials and highly productive zones in the area are associated with secondary structures folds fractures and veins fractures are responsible for increasing porosity of the bedrock allowing for greater groundwater flow and storage this complements petrographic analysis that showed many microfractures because of extensional stress and brittle deformation these microfractures generated secondary porosity thus enhancing groundwater flow this corroborates sem analysis that showed grain truncations and cobweb textures within areas dominated by mica and this is clear evidence of intense fracturing geophysical surveys have further shown zones of weaknesses which have been inferred as fault zones to be responsible for groundwater availability fractured zones by resistivity sounding indicate high potential zones for groundwater localisation low resistivity zones suggest highly fractured and faulted regions hence good for groundwater accumulation while high resistivities are associated with unweathered quartzite and igneous intrusions the study area comprises of highly fractured localities and this could be due to the tectonic movement because of multiple phases of deformations of the cape fold belt it is recommended that the ndlambe municipality be surveyed further by geological and geophysical methods magnetic and gravity methods to further understand the geohydrology of the area this can be coupled with porosity and density measurements to delineate groundwater potential zones for borehole drill sites studies should focus on the determination of aquifer hydraulic properties and recharge issues through geochemistry isotope studies this will assist the sustainable management of the aquifers in this era of climate change acknowledgements authors

called human supreme abilities as humankind suffers the greatest threat since world war ii the covid 19 has made us aware of our individual and global interactions with the environment the ongoing pandemic covid 2019 has created a global health emergency in more than 200 countries around the globe and infected a large number of hosts more than 3 5 million people with a mortality rate of more than 3 6 kumar et al 2020a b unfortunately to what extent and with what quantum of damage it will be to the entire humanity is still unknown and can only be speculated partially khan et al 2020 even animals are getting infected from this deadly virus as reported from the bronx zoo in new york city usa where four tigers and three lions were found covid 19 positive new york post april 22 2020 we have seen how socially and economically vulnerable we are by confining individuals and families to tackle a global pandemic but also by using global social networks and media to survive social distancing we have seen how relentless inequality makes chronically disadvantaged communities more vulnerable to a virus that attacks every single human being across the globe and within small communities the pandemic caused by this virus triggers changes in educational technological and social aspects that depict the uneven risks and people communities and countries response and resilience lipsitch et al 2020 at this junction of gloomy period there is an urgent need to find a way out of this global crisis though a silver lining had begun to appear and is currently observed across the world as possible solutions to the anthropocene epoch which were our key concern before the pandemic virus outbreak environmental degradation ozone layer depletion pollution water resource management and climate change were amongst the top challenges of the 21st century kumar et al 2020b a collective basic and applied research efforts such as wastewater based epidemiological approach for virus monitoring are still needed to advance foundational understanding engineered approaches and innovative solutions for environmental quality monitoring management and progress in environmental sustainability to formulate efficient policy papers and overcome associated environmental maladies kumar et al 2020c although there is an ample literature resources on the sustainability of human life population growth and environmental conservation aspects still the deep insights on local and global socio political relations and economic growth after an uncertain incubation period are need of the hour the cluster lockdowns as a result of the covid 19 pandemic has however forced us to ponder about the self revival ability of the earth an aspect which have been taken for granted by humans since centuries more than half of the nations developing and developed have suddenly and drastically faced major economic disruptions along with other socio economic irregularities which is already revealing surprising data in such a short time and would continue to do so in the long run as well during such critical time periods indubitably it can be recorded that numerous problems are existing with the lockdown for both public movement and behavior yet the unconfirmed and unevaluated changes and experiences are observed around the world in terms of environmental restoration and environmental planning sjodin et al 1998 the two most readily observed aspects have been recorded in the context of ecological disturbances air and water pollution 2 vehicular traffic even with a partial lockdown the reduction in road traffic was almost 40 60 and with complete lockdown it has gone to an unprecedented level recently more than 1 25 million people die in road accidents each year on an average 3700 people lose their lives every day on the roads an additional 20 50 million suffer from non fatal injuries often resulting in long term disabilities zhang and batterman 2013 the probable rate of road fatalities in india is 26 1 100 000 inhabitants while the global calculated road fatalities are 155 8 100 000 motor vehicles rodrigue 2016 around 414 deaths occur daily in india due to road accidents bu et al 2020 a number which has now become negligible due to lockdown this traffic effect will show significant changes with the shifting of a major portion of the education and partial office work to online mode of operation the higher vehicular activities and traffic congestion increase vehicular greenhouse gases ghg and black carbon emission which degrade the ambient air quality and increase the global warming potential recent studies have shown an excess number of morbidity and mortality cases for drivers commuters and individuals living near major roadways and traffic intersections due to acute and chronic exposure to air pollution krzyżanowski et al 2005 the increase in the number of vehicles further leads to an increase in on road traffic congestion which escalates travel time air pollution emissions and carbon pollutant emissions exposure on a per vehicle basis the presence of traffic congestion average speed of 21 km h results in 4 fold 3 fold and a 2 fold increase in carbon monoxide co hydrocarbon hc and oxides of nitrogen nox emissions respectively which goes considerably down under less congested conditions average speed of 61 70 km hour rodrigue 2016 transportation sector plays a fundamental role in the lives of individuals and societies as a whole transportation is a multidimensional activity which impacts history politics economics and above all environment the patterns of people interactions work play organizing production urbanization and access to services amenities and goods are inextricably linked to the development of mobility and the decision making process of these people the important consequences of transportation manifest are its effect on air and water quality noise level and public health these impacts fall within three categories of direct indirect and cumulative effect lipsitch et al 2020 these developments and the demands generated by markets however often disregard the ensuing consequences in terms of increased fuel consumption higher emission of air pollutants and greater exposure of masses to hazardous conditions causing severe and chronic health issues the increased intensity of dependency on transport also increase the risk of road traffic injuries exposure to noise and sedentary lifestyles an increasing body of evidence points to the magnitude of these adverse effects on health and the need to identify solutions that both reduce risks to health and meet the requirement for mobility fang et al 2020 3 greenhouse gases ghgs and air pollution emissions the european environment agency eea estimates that road transport contributes to excessive concentrations of about 70 for nitrogen dioxide no2 and about 30 for particulate matter pm it is estimated that around 7 of the eu urban population is exposed to no2 levels above the eu who guideline value and that more than three quarters of the urban population is exposed to pm2 5 levels exceeding the who guideline value giannis et al 2020 in the usa alone transportation accounted for the most significant portion 29 of total u s ghg emissions in 2017 the on road vehicles account for 82 of ghg emissions whereas air travel contributes only 9 of total ghg emissions khan et al 2020 luan and ching 2020 these numbers indicate that any reduction in vehicular traffic on roads would create a significant decrease in ghg emissions luan and ching 2020 as it is already being recorded under the lockdown air pollution levels which authorities across the world seemed unable to control despite a plethora of efforts have automatically gone down as a result of the lockdown the pm10 and pm2 5 particulate matter having less than 10 μm and 2 5 μm aerodynamic diameter respectively levels have recorded their lowest statistics making lockdown a legitimate measure in case of severe air pollution episode the covid 19 pandemic has caused a significant drop in ghg and air pollution across the globe and moving towards a record annual dip of 5 ghg emission from fossil fuels burning around china europe and the usa bukhari and jameel 2020 in china the emission has been dropped by 25 due to lockdown which resulted in a 40 reduction in coal consumption shutting down industries and stay at home the good quality air days have been increased up to 11 4 in 337 cities around china in comparison to the last year s similar months casanova et al 2010 moreover no2 emissions fell significantly in italy spain and the uk referring to satellite images in europe bu et al 2020 the probability of the ozone layer restoring itself has increased primarily because of the drastic reduction of vehicular traffic both on road and air another important point which many of us are not noticing that covid 19 also increased the probability of indoor air pollution event in low income society about 40 3 billion of the total global population uses polluting cooking fuels i e firewood cow dung crop residue and kerosene khan et al 2020 many of these people spend their day time due to working schooling outdoor activities outside their home which leads to less exposure to high indoor air pollution however due to lockdown these low income people have to spend the whole day in an indoor environment which leads to high exposure to air pollution 4 water pollution the second most significant area of rapid pollution and the rapid area of research is related to water based resources the global media captured the clearing of the venetian canals with a spark of hope in an otherwise fatal condition of the covid 19 pandemic in india as well authorities and citizens both have observed a reduction in pollution levels of ganges and yamuna rivers in the northern part of the country the dissolved oxygen level in the ganges was recorded to be 8 9 mg l in upstream and 8 3 mg l in downstream significantly above the level of 7 mg l which constitutes the beginning range for healthy water boone et al 2020 yunus et al 2020 the real time monitoring data collected by central pollution control board cpcb revealed that the water quality of river ganges at twenty seven different points was satisfactory for bathing purposes and dissemination of wildlife and fisheries bu et al 2020 ramasamy et al 2017 the rivers seemed to be cleaning itself without any effort although sewage load has not reduced asselman 1999 however the drastic reduction in industrial pollution which is one of the major causes of river water putrefaction is proving sufficient for the rivers to restore themselves vinita et al 2017 li et al 2020 moreover there has also been a remarkable reduction in the number of funeral activities as reported by various crematoriums which has also led to a decrease in load on the rivers the number of dead bodies are coming to delhi s nigam bodh ghat hindu crematorium situated on the banks of yamuna has come down already by 25 30 gaunt and templeton 2010 similarly varanasi ghats are receiving just one third to one fourth of average corpses for cremation the situation is almost the same in the burial ground crematorium and similar places of other religions based on verbal communication from the source 5 ecological footprint these changes are bound to have a massive impact on the ecological footprint the eco footprint is based on every human induced activity no matter how small it is if a country does not possess enough ecological resources within its territory compared to its consumption it leads to the local ecological deficit and the country becomes an ecological debtor country if the opposite stands true and the country possesses an ecological reserve then it is called an ecological creditor country life first appeared on this planet some 3800 million years ago and since then the humans have left their ecological footprint however the world has accounted for a 104 increase in its population since the year 1970s with a 58 decline in the average population size of vertebrate species which means that since 1970 almost 60 of humanity s ecological footprint has been nothing but carbon li et al 2020 khan et al 2020 if everyone in the world bears the similar lifestyle alike australians and americans we would need 5 4 and 4 8 earths respectively to support humanity in fact we already need 1 75 planet earth to support humanity s demand on the earth s ecosystem gaunt and templeton 2010 asselman 1999 these developments led to the conception of the idea of earth overshoot day by andrew simms of the uk think tank new economics foundation and is now an active initiative under the global footprint network boone et al 2020 earth overshoot day marks the date when humanity s demand for ecological resources and services in a given year exceeds what earth can regenerate in that year this deficit is calculated by liquidating stocks of ecological resources and accumulating waste primarily carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the environmental changes being observed under lockdown and the self healing process that nature seems to have initiated due to a decrease in active human exploitation and intervention has the potential for bringing about a positive change in eco footprint 6 e learning at present many activities are altogether stopped due to lockdown but some are running at a partial pace some activities are stepped up at a much higher pace than what they were earlier prior to the spread of the covid 19 pandemic for instance online education online health care online business kumar et al 2020b usually people feel very skeptical about education in distance mode i e online however now there is a shift in opinion about its effectiveness what it was presumed earlier this lockdown has for the first time provided an opportunity to experience and implement many such sectors under the online mode and the results are visible why should we consider online education as a viable option well it brings along many benefits it guarantees convenience and flexibility to study at any hour of the day the online tutorials help to log in at any time and simply study according to mood and convenience students can choose to undertake training in many courses simultaneously as it offers diverse options it also provides an opportunity for networking with faculty and students all across the world so it cuts down on unnecessary transportation costs and helps to save the environment too the online courses are available at an affordable prices and are cheap in comparison to classroom teaching digital education was already flourishing however present immovability provides an opportunity on larger canvass the number of massive open online courses moocs for example has surged since they first appeared in the year 2000 moocs are now mainstream and the number of available courses was reported in 2016 to be growing daily zhang and batterman 2013 the number of moocs has increased by more than 683 percent with only 1200 moocs in 2013 while the total number of learners enrolled in moocs has rose up to 81 million from 10 million the number of universities offering moocs has also increased tremendously khan et al 2020 the demand for education won t be curbed by economic growth the number of people in middle income brackets is expected to increase almost 10 fold within two decades from 50 million people in 2010 to 475 million people in 2030 gaunt and templeton 2010 in bangladesh meanwhile an estimated 30 million to 40 million people will join the ranks of the middle class by 2025 thereby demanding for more affordable education india for instance has one of the largest education systems in the world with a network of more than 1 million schools and 18 000 higher education institutions fang et al 2020 more than half of the country s 1 3 billion population falls in the target market for education and related services looking at the demand the public and private sectors in india cannot cater to the requirements of such a vast demand through conventional modes of schools colleges and universities it is only the online education sector which can do this wonder and this corona period has proved it to test on such a large scale that too with the minimal available infrastructure it is expected that the facilities would also be boosted up with the expansion of this sector krzyżanowski et al 2005 sjodin et al 1998 in 2017 it was assessed that the online education market is proliferating over 24 of annual growth rate and is expected to reach approximately usd 423 billion by the end of the forecast period however given the corona disaster this share would increase by leaps and bounds fetzer et al 2020 it is not so that the entire education sector would be transformed but it would experience significant change the conventional component of the traditional education would confine to experimental laboratory work research protocols viva voce presentations theatres etc which may account for less than around 25 30 infrastructure gaunt and templeton 2010 the only raw material for online education is internet facilities with seamless uninterrupted signals with proper bandwidth in every nook and corner and recourse persons the consequential financial savings would significantly reduce the cost of education however the rural sector would face initial hardship due to the restricted availability of the internet at desired speed and hardware nevertheless the necessity would pave its way sooner or later in lieu of these initial shortcomings the consequential financial savings would greatly reduce the cost of education 7 conclusions the covid 19 pandemic will leave a lasting impact on our lives and most definitely a negative one only time will reveal the quantum of human sacrifice and economic set back that we may suffer because of it ironically the only certainty about the coronavirus is its uncertainty however one more thing is sure in these times that the world is going to witness an age of drastic change not just in the environment around us and our interaction with nature and issues of climate change sustainability water resource management and pollution control both air and water borne but also in the field of education health care hygiene maintenance work and employment models economic setup consumption patterns and the overall behavior and psychology of the human race in any case tropical areas might have the potential to become a reservoir of such pandemic outbreak during the entire period of winter in october and november 2020 as per spatio temporal modeling data analysis by a group of researchers in the developed nations a global consensus human intervention is needed interms of policy and socio economic measures to combat such pandemic outbreak which is rapidly spreading over the human populations and has potentially opened the pandora s box of pathogenic viruses acknowledgment we would like to thank dr mohammad kaleem siddiqui consultant

statistics making lockdown a legitimate measure in case of severe air pollution episode the covid 19 pandemic has caused a significant drop in ghg and air pollution across the globe and moving towards a record annual dip of 5 ghg emission from fossil fuels burning around china europe and the usa bukhari and jameel 2020 in china the emission has been dropped by 25 due to lockdown which resulted in a 40 reduction in coal consumption shutting down industries and stay at home the good quality air days have been increased up to 11 4 in 337 cities around china in comparison to the last year s similar months casanova et al 2010 moreover no2 emissions fell significantly in italy spain and the uk referring to satellite images in europe bu et al 2020 the probability of the ozone layer restoring itself has increased primarily because of the drastic reduction of vehicular traffic both on road and air another important point which many of us are not noticing that covid 19 also increased the probability of indoor air pollution event in low income society about 40 3 billion of the total global population uses polluting cooking fuels i e firewood cow dung crop residue and kerosene khan et al 2020 many of these people spend their day time due to working schooling outdoor activities outside their home which leads to less exposure to high indoor air pollution however due to lockdown these low income people have to spend the whole day in an indoor environment which leads to high exposure to air pollution 4 water pollution the second most significant area of rapid pollution and the rapid area of research is related to water based resources the global media captured the clearing of the venetian canals with a spark of hope in an otherwise fatal condition of the covid 19 pandemic in india as well authorities and citizens both have observed a reduction in pollution levels of ganges and yamuna rivers in the northern part of the country the dissolved oxygen level in the ganges was recorded to be 8 9 mg l in upstream and 8 3 mg l in downstream significantly above the level of 7 mg l which constitutes the beginning range for healthy water boone et al 2020 yunus et al 2020 the real time monitoring data collected by central pollution control board cpcb revealed that the water quality of river ganges at twenty seven different points was satisfactory for bathing purposes and dissemination of wildlife and fisheries bu et al 2020 ramasamy et al 2017 the rivers seemed to be cleaning itself without any effort although sewage load has not reduced asselman 1999 however the drastic reduction in industrial pollution which is one of the major causes of river water putrefaction is proving sufficient for the rivers to restore themselves vinita et al 2017 li et al 2020 moreover there has also been a remarkable reduction in the number of funeral activities as reported by various crematoriums which has also led to a decrease in load on the rivers the number of dead bodies are coming to delhi s nigam bodh ghat hindu crematorium situated on the banks of yamuna has come down already by 25 30 gaunt and templeton 2010 similarly varanasi ghats are receiving just one third to one fourth of average corpses for cremation the situation is almost the same in the burial ground crematorium and similar places of other religions based on verbal communication from the source 5 ecological footprint these changes are bound to have a massive impact on the ecological footprint the eco footprint is based on every human induced activity no matter how small it is if a country does not possess enough ecological resources within its territory compared to its consumption it leads to the local ecological deficit and the country becomes an ecological debtor country if the opposite stands true and the country possesses an ecological reserve then it is called an ecological creditor country life first appeared on this planet some 3800 million years ago and since then the humans have left their ecological footprint however the world has accounted for a 104 increase in its population since the year 1970s with a 58 decline in the average population size of vertebrate species which means that since 1970 almost 60 of humanity s ecological footprint has been nothing but carbon li et al 2020 khan et al 2020 if everyone in the world bears the similar lifestyle alike australians and americans we would need 5 4 and 4 8 earths respectively to support humanity in fact we already need 1 75 planet earth to support humanity s demand on the earth s ecosystem gaunt and templeton 2010 asselman 1999 these developments led to the conception of the idea of earth overshoot day by andrew simms of the uk think tank new economics foundation and is now an active initiative under the global footprint network boone et al 2020 earth overshoot day marks the date when humanity s demand for ecological resources and services in a given year exceeds what earth can regenerate in that year this deficit is calculated by liquidating stocks of ecological resources and accumulating waste primarily carbon dioxide in the atmosphere the environmental changes being observed under lockdown and the self healing process that nature seems to have initiated due to a decrease in active human exploitation and intervention has the potential for bringing about a positive change in eco footprint 6 e learning at present many activities are altogether stopped due to lockdown but some are running at a partial pace some activities are stepped up at a much higher pace than what they were earlier prior to the spread of the covid 19 pandemic for instance online education online health care online business kumar et al 2020b usually people feel very skeptical about education in distance mode i e online however now there is a shift in opinion about its effectiveness what it was presumed earlier this lockdown has for the first time provided an opportunity to experience and implement many such sectors under the online mode and the results are visible why should we consider online education as a viable option well it brings along many benefits it guarantees convenience and flexibility to study at any hour of the day the online tutorials help to log in at any time and simply study according to mood and convenience students can choose to undertake training in many courses simultaneously as it offers diverse options it also provides an opportunity for networking with faculty and students all across the world so it cuts down on unnecessary transportation costs and helps to save the environment too the online courses are available at an affordable prices and are cheap in comparison to classroom teaching digital education was already flourishing however present immovability provides an opportunity on larger canvass the number of massive open online courses moocs for example has surged since they first appeared in the year 2000 moocs are now mainstream and the number of available courses was reported in 2016 to be growing daily zhang and batterman 2013 the number of moocs has increased by more than 683 percent with only 1200 moocs in 2013 while the total number of learners enrolled in moocs has rose up to 81 million from 10 million the number of universities offering moocs has also increased tremendously khan et al 2020 the demand for education won t be curbed by economic growth the number of people in middle income brackets is expected to increase almost 10 fold within two decades from 50 million people in 2010 to 475 million people in 2030 gaunt and templeton 2010 in bangladesh meanwhile an estimated 30 million to 40 million people will join the ranks of the middle class by 2025 thereby demanding for more affordable education india for instance has one of the largest education systems in the world with a network of more than 1 million schools and 18 000 higher education institutions fang et al 2020 more than half of the country s 1 3 billion population falls in the target market for education and related services looking at the demand the public and private sectors in india cannot cater to the requirements of such a vast demand through conventional modes of schools colleges and universities it is only the online education sector which can do this wonder and this corona period has proved it to test on such a large scale that too with the minimal available infrastructure it is expected that the facilities would also be boosted up with the expansion of this sector krzyżanowski et al 2005 sjodin et al 1998 in 2017 it was assessed that the online education market is proliferating over 24 of annual growth rate and is expected to reach approximately usd 423 billion by the end of the forecast period however given the corona disaster this share would increase by leaps and bounds fetzer et al 2020 it is not so that the entire education sector would be transformed but it would experience significant change the conventional component of the traditional education would confine to experimental laboratory work research protocols viva voce presentations theatres etc which may account for less than around 25 30 infrastructure gaunt and templeton 2010 the only raw material for online education is internet facilities with seamless uninterrupted signals with proper bandwidth in every nook and corner and recourse persons the consequential financial savings would significantly reduce the cost of education however the rural sector would face initial hardship due to the restricted availability of the internet at desired speed and hardware nevertheless the necessity would pave its way sooner or later in lieu of these initial shortcomings the consequential financial savings would greatly reduce the cost of education 7 conclusions the covid 19 pandemic will leave a lasting impact on our lives and most definitely a negative one only time will reveal the quantum of human sacrifice and economic set back that we may suffer because of it ironically the only certainty about the coronavirus is its uncertainty however one more thing is sure in these times that the world is going to witness an age of drastic change not just in the environment around us and our interaction with nature and issues of climate change sustainability water resource management and pollution control both air and water borne but also in the field of education health care hygiene maintenance work and employment models economic setup consumption patterns and the overall behavior and psychology of the human race in any case tropical areas might have the potential to become a reservoir of such pandemic outbreak during the entire period of winter in october and november 2020 as per spatio temporal modeling data analysis by a group of researchers in the developed nations a global consensus human intervention is needed interms of policy and socio economic measures to combat such pandemic outbreak which is

12078,morphometry is a tool to search for groundwater resources through the studies of various landforms and drainage system the drainage pattern is an important prerequisite in evaluating the basin hydrology through the knowledge of morphometric parameters the system of streaming wherein the water reaches the streams is dependent upon the morphometric characteristics of the basin the extracted drainage network was classified according to strahler s system and it reveals that the basin exhibits dendritic to sub dendritic drainage pattern the jilledubanderu river basin is sprawled over an area of 486 95 km2 and forms a part of the chitravathi river system the study area is designated as sixth order basin and lower order streams mostly dominate the basin with the average drainage density of 1 96 km km2 the slope of basin varies from 0 to 35 and the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles the elongation ratio value is 0 66 indicating the basin has elongated shape with moderate relief and steep slopes the drainage texture of the basin is 5 69 which indicate an intermediate texture that exists over the region hence from the study it can be concluded that remote sensing data srtm dem coupled with geospatial techniques prove to be a competent tool in morphometric analysis and the data can be used for basin management and other hydrological studies in future graphical abstract image 1 keywords srtm dem morphometry remote sensing gis watershed management 1 introduction watershed is a geo hydrological unit draining run off water at a common point and it could be determined based on ridge and gully regions hydrologically watershed could be defined as an area from which run off drains to a particular point in a drainage system since water follows a definite flow course watershed becomes an ideal hydrologic unit for conducting the developmental activity related to water management singh et al 2014 yadav et al 2014 kanhaiya et al 2019 singh et al 2018a patel and srivastava 2013 patel et al 2012 watershed approach for optimal planning development and management aims at harnessing all natural resources for sustainable development and better living the factors that play a vital role in the planning and development are the watershed size shape physiography soils soil erosion zones landuse landcover hydrogeological setting etc with the help of remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis it is now possible to gain appreciation of resources from larger basinal areas in a very short period and in a more comprehensive manner than the conventional ground surveys patel et al 2012 strahler 1957a strahler and chow 1964a avinash et al 2011 singh and kanhaiya 2015 morphometric characteristics of many river basins and sub basins in different parts of the world have been studied using conventional methods patel et al 2013 srivastava et al 2008 various researchers have analyzed the morphometric parameters to explore the physiographic settings of river basin using rs and gis methods geographic and geomorphologic features of the catchment area are used in hydrological studies including groundwater potential assessment and priority catchment areas sreedevi et al 2013 moniruzzaman et al 2018 singh and dubey 1997 a number of researchers conducted morphometric analysis of different river basins in india using remote sensing and gis in recent years singh 1972 rs gis techniques are prevalent and an effective means of studying the relationship among spatial variables srivastava et al 2012a 2012b singh et al 2018b singh and srivastava 1974 gis being a very powerful analytical tool which can generate manipulate the files and processing of spatial data ensuring high quality results and effectively integrate thematic layers for geospatial perspectives singh et al 2013a a series of articles have been written and published on the morphometric analysis of the basin particularly the change in flow space time frequency and the drainage density of the basin in arid regions of anantapur district andhra pradesh india srivastava et al 2012c traditionally the river geomorphology studies in india depend on topography and drainage classification however in recent decades field studies on the characteristics and behaviour of the river channel as well as developments in the field of rs and gis have strengthened the river geomorphology kale and shejwalkar 2007 the present study focuses on the morphometric analysis of jilledubanderu river basin using rs gis technoligies which is the master consequent stream of chitravati river anantapur district andhra pradesh india 2 study area jilledubanderu river starts its journey from bukkapatnam reserved forest situated in anantapur district and has been selected for the present study this is the largest province in andhra pradesh with 19 130 km2 area and receives 563 mm average annual rainfall jilledubanderu rises in the south eastern region of anantapur the area affected by drought and extends from 77 48 34 e to 78 58 11 e longitude and 14 05 35 n to 14 26 45 n latitude fig 1 the area of the basin is 486 95 sq km2 and the perimeter is 143 38 km falling in the toposheets of 57j 3 57j 4 57 f 15 and 57 f 16 of scale 1 50 000 the river has several bar deposits and other morphological features along its course geologically this area comprises of five lithological units fig 2 starting from hard rock terrain along with an archaean peninsular gneissic complex of hornblende biotite gneiss granodiorite and lamprophyre gsi 2002 rajasekhar et al 2018 these granitic rocks are traversed by means of dolerite dykes in the north of catchment area of the basin an isolated patch of

hill on red granite fairly and shallow weathered pediplains pediment inselberg and structural hill of granite and granodiorite and dyke ridges are intruded into all of the 4 lithological formations various aspects of ground water prevalence distribution pleasant status of development of anantapur district had been elaborately mentioned the average well density in mandals blanketed inside the watershed ranges from 4 to 7 in line with square km and bukkapatnam mandal which occupies greater than 1 2 of the watershed is asserted as overexploited cgwb 2013 3 methodology morphometric analysis of the jilledubanderu river basin was carried out using the soi topographical maps 57 f 15 57 f 16 57 j 3 and 57 j 4 on a 1 50 000 scale the analysis includes the aspects such as stream order stream length stream length ratio elongation ratio circulatory ratio drainage density drainage texture and bifurcation ratio etc the drainage network of the basin was analyzed by following the procedures of horton 1945 and strahler 1964 soi topographic maps were georeferenced using wgs 84 datum universal transverse mercator utm zone 44n projection in arcgis desktop 10 4 in the present research an integrated use of multispectral satellite data srtm shuttle radar topographic mission dem digital elevation model and soi topographical sheets were utilized for the generation of database and extraction of numerous drainage parameters details of the data used are shown in table 1 the elevation and other characteristics of the study area are recorded by a global positioning system during fieldwork in this study the jilledubanderu river was delineated and drainage network was extracted using srtm dem 1 arc sec in conjunction with soi toposheets other necessary procedures are also provided as a repair dem and filling the sinks after completion of dem the flow direction was calculated for each pixel in order to generate a drainage network the flow accumulation was taken into account on the basis of flow direction of each cell horton 1932 morphometric parameters were analyzed and classified into 3 classes associated with their orientation in space they are linear aerial and relief aspects and calculated on the basis of the formulas shown in table 2 and also the flow chart of the methodology is illustrated in fig 3 4 results and discussion the quantitative morphometric analysis provides information about hydrological properties of the rocks that are exposed in the river basin drainage map of the study area provides a reliable measure of rock permeability and indicates the yield of the basin srtm dem 1 arc sec is acquired with a pixel size of 90 m and then used to calculate the slope and thematic river basin maps horton 1945 the evolution of the drainage system depends on geology rainfall except for exogenous and endogenous areas of knowledge linear aerial and relief aspects considerations have been evaluated through arcgis 10 4 software schumm 1956 the latest development in rs and gis tools is to evaluate the drainage basin more accurately and correctly assess the morphometric parameters with greater precision rs and gis data successfully applied to obtain spatial differences in drainage characteristics provide an overview of the hydrological conditions necessary for the development of river basin management strategies sahu et al 2017 it also gives a valid evidence of the relationship between water surveying integrative drainage analysis and subsurface geometry thus morphometric analysis is always different from region to region the soil in space and time controls water storage and most of these factors depend on later parameters such as 1 water source as rain water availability 2 drainage characteristics and act as a drainage characteristic invasion and control the behaviour of water on the surface of the field vertically and horizontally 3 lithology types and characteristics to control flow and storage management 4 the slope is another factor and controls the energy flow of water that plays a role in facilitating the flow of water into the basin parveen et al 2012 jilledubanderu river basin quantitative analysis has been done to analyze drainage properties using the arcgis 10 4 software linear and areal parameters are important and their relationship among the basin area perimeter basin length bifurcation ratio rb drainage density dd stream frequency fs circulatory ratio rc elongation ratio re etc information used on various morphometric and legal parameters is shown in table 2 4 1 stream number nu stream order nu refers to a hierarchical link between the individual fragments that pass into a drainage network in accordance with the horton principle the number of streams is negatively correlated with the order in which the stream number and the downward flow trend decrease rai et al 2017a the number of streams nu is shown in each order in table 3 the study region includes a dendritic drainage system that shows homogeneous subsurface beds in this study stream ordering was classified with a proposed methodology das and mukherjee 2005 strahler 1957b the streams were digitized from topographical maps and satellite imageries the stream order of study the region shown in fig 4 4 2 stream order the effectiveness of drainage development is related to stream magnitude so that the stream order is considered as an important parameter in a linear aspect of a drainage basin the first order streams have no tributaries strahler 1958 the second order streams have the tributaries of only first order channels a segment of third order is formed where 2 s order channels join when two third order segments join a fourth order channel is formed the same process continues up to sixth order strahler and chow 1964b accordingly the jilledubanderu basin is designated as a sixth order basin table 3 the lower number of streams in iii and iv orders indicates the matured topography adjacent to the stream whereas the higher number of streams in i and ii orders indicate the topography is still under erosion 4 3 stream length lu mean stream length lsm the stream length mean stream length and stream length ratio have been calculated using the gis based regulation proposed by horton 1945 the first order drainage is total 475 05 km in length second order has a length of 233 18 km third order has a length of 116 26 km fourth order covers a total length of 76 30 km fifth order cover a total length of 41 23 km sixth order streams covers a total length of 14 29 km and the total length of jilledubanderu river covering all these orders is 956 31 km table 3 therefore it is observed that the first order stream has the highest total stream length and the number of streams because they are distributed more effectively than the other orders the first order stream having more or less half of the stream length is ephemeral in dry season and rest of the season the stream is perennial the perennial length may decrease further upstream and may be shorter in the dry season with decreasing groundwater recharge kaliraj et al 2015 4 4 stream length ratio rl stream length ratio has an important relationship with surface flow discharge and erosional stage of the basin stream length ratio is the ratio of the mean length of the segments of the next lower order which tends to be constant throughout the successive orders of a basin singh et al 2013b the stream length ratio is calculated using the formula shown in table 2 the stream ratios of the jilledubanderu river basin range from 0 69 to 3 78 table 3 the variation in the stream length ratios may be due to the differences in slope and topographical conditions 4 5 stream frequency fs horton imputed the theory 1932 1945 which is unswervingly associated with geological properties the number of streams per unit area is called the stream frequency high frequency drainage characterized by a steep surface vegetation rare high surface runoff impermeable substrate and the high relief jilledubanderu basin flow rate value is 2 89 km2 which indicates the positive correlation with the drainage area density table 4 4 6 bifurcation ratio rb bifurcation ratio is the ratio of the number of streams of any given order to the number of segments of the higher stream order horton 1932 the bifurcation ratio is calculated by the formula shown in table 2 the bifurcation ratios among the streams of different orders in jilledubanderu basin the mean bifurcation ratio of the basin is 4 39 which indicates low rainfall shallow weathering and low dissection of the valley of the area under investigation the values of bifurcation ratio less than 5 suggested that the geological structures do not show any dominant influence on the drainage pattern arulbalaji and gurugnanam 2017 4 7 drainage density dd drainage density is a measure of the degree of drainage development within a basin it reflects the closeness of channel spacings attributing to differential weathering of various formations relief and rainfall in a basin area according to horton 1932 the drainage density is defined as the length of stream per unit of a drainage area divided by the area of the drainage basins the formula is shown in table 2 smith 1950 and strahler 1957 have described drainage density values less than 5 as coarse 5 to 13 7 as a medium between 13 7 and 155 3 as fineand greater than 155 3 as ultra fine chow 1964 is of the opinion that the low drainage density is favoured in regions of highly permeable sub soil materials under dense drainage density which is favoured in regions of weak or impermeable sub soil materials sparse vegetation and mountain relief smith 1950 the drainage density computed according to horton s formula in the jilledubanderu river basin is 1 96 km km2 fig 5 table 3 it suggests that the drainage density is low reflecting permeable sub surface stratum with dense vegetation and low relief 4 8 drainage texture t drainage texture is a measure of width of the channel spacing it depends on climate rainfall rock and soil type infiltration capacity relief and stage of development of drainage smith 1950 weak rocks produce fine texture while hard rocks develops coarse texture sparse vegetation of an arid climate causes the development of fine texture than those developed on similar rocks in a humid climate the texture of a rock depends upon vegetation and climatic conditions miller 1953 the drainage texture is computed by the formula shown in table 2 the drainage texture of the jilledubanderu basin is 5 69 per km table 3 gentle slopes and almost flat topography cause the fine texture with lesser rainfall intensity the intermediate texture may be attributed to sub humid climate with hard rock formations 4 9 elongation ratio re elongation ratio is the ratio between the diameter of a circle of the same area as the basin and the maximum basin length schumm 1956 the formula is shown in table 2 strahler 1964 states that the elongation ratio ranges from 0 6 to 1 over a wide variety of climatic and geological formations values of elongation ratio near to 1 are found in the typical regions of very low relief while values from 0 6 to 0 8 are generally associated with the strong relief and steep slopes pakhmode et al 2003 the elongation ratio of the jilledubanderu river basin is 0 66 it infers that the basin is elongated with strong relief and steep slopes due to the structural disturbances 4 10 circularity ratio rc circularity ratio is a quantitative expression of the shape of the basin it is defined as the ratio of basin area to the area of circle having the same perimeter as the basin rao 2009 and formula expressed in table 2 the circularity ratio is generally influenced by length frequency and gradient of streams of various orders rather than slope and drainage conditions of a basin low medium and high circularity ratio values are indicative of youth mature and old stages of the basin respectively the computed value of circularity ratio of the jilledubanderu river basin is 0 30 table 4 the circularity ratio indicates the early mature stage of the topography the difference in the circularity ratio values may be due to the variations in slope relief and structural conditions of the river basin 4 11 shape factor bs shape factor bs is the ratio of the square of the length of the basin bs of the study regions shows 2 88 value table 4 that indicate irregularity in shape of the basin 4 12 constant of channel maintenance c the constant of channel maintenance c is the inverse of drainage density dd the parameter can determine the area required to maintain a linear channel km flow in this factor c depends on the slope of the basin the lithology the esoteric vegetation and the erosion span however higher c values show a basin with higher permeability rocks and vice versa chopra et al 2005 the c value of the whole jilledubanderu river basin 0 36 table 4 indicates an average area of 0 51 km2 needed to maintain the stream flow length of 1 km 4 13 form factor ff form factor ff is a parameter that is used to predict the intensity of a basin in a particular area having a direct relationship to peak discharge horton 1945 ff can be defined as the ratio of the area of a basin and square of the basin length sreedevi et al 2005 the ff value will always be greater than 0 78 for an absolutely circular basin the lowest value means ff more elongated i e 0 35 table 4 indicates the elongated shape of the basin 4 14 basin relief r basin relief r is defined as the difference in elevation between the highest and the lowest points of the basin the r controls the stream gradient and therefore influences the flood patterns amount of the sediment transported and geomorphic processes and landform characteristic burrough et al 2015 it also contains information on the number of potential and kinetic energy that is reflected in the production of surface water runoff precipitation and flood in the basin the highest point in jilledubanderu basin is 548 m and the lowest 390 m thus the relief is 158 m table 5 showing a moderate slope low runoff and enhanced infiltration in the basin 4 15 relief ratio rr maximum relief of the horizontal distance along the longest dimension of basin along the main drainage line indicated as a relief ratio rr schumm 1956 the rr is a comprehensive slope catchment area and is an indicator of the intensity of erosion process on the working basin slope schumm 1956 if the value rr is high it indicates hilly terrain and low value of rr represents pediplain and valley maathuis and wang 2006 understanding the distribution of slope is of vital importance it provides information on the planning of human settlements agricultural opportunities afforestation and engineering construction plans the rr of jilledubanderu basin shows 0 24 rr value indicates moderate sediment transport and flow of erosion table 5 rr usually increases with decreasing size of the drainage basin 4 16 aspect map the aspect map is usually related to the direction of the slope face aspect map is an absolutely important parameter for understanding the impact of the sun shine on the site of the neighbourhood time in general to the west with a slope that reflects the hottest during the day and in most cases the western side with a slope may be warmer than a sheltered slope on the eastern side maathuis and wang 2006 aspect map has an important consequences in the distribution of field vegetation form the aspect map derived from srtm dem represents the compass route 0 is north with time 90 issue to the east fig 6 the jilledubanderu basin offers east facing slopes and thus these slopes have a higher moisture content and higher vegetation than in the western slope 4 17 slope map the slope is a measure of changes in surface values at a distance and can be expressed in degrees or as a percentage dem raster format is a grid in which each cell represents a value compared to a common reference point after calculating the slope the maximum difference and slope can be identified jha et al 2007 kudnar and rajasekhar 2020 map results are used to create a map of biased neighbourhood s usage of arcgis 10 4 spatial analyst tools maximum topographic height 548 m and 158 low amsl exists in the western and north western part of site size causing the highest outflow and therefore much less chance of raining infiltration tilted study area map is grouped into five classes namely 1 3 gentle 3 5 moderate 5 10 steep 100 35 very steep and 35 very very steep fig 7 it is found that a large part of the jilledubanderu basin area under gentle and slight slopes suggest nearly flat topography of the region gentle slopes have been certain inside the remarkable category for groundwater control because the almost flat terrain is mostly favourable for infiltration moderate slopes also fall into the accurate area due to a slightly hilly relief that gives partial runoff the steep magnificence and having an excessive floor runoff with a negligible quantity of infiltration are marked under precise area for construction of dams and so forth the slope is an essential parameter without which delay controls runoff and infiltration of any terrain prabhakaran and raj 2018 runoff in greater slope areas causes less infiltration such component significantly needs the improvement of aquifers 4 18 hydrological interferences from morphometric analysis quantitative assessment of morphometric parameters has been set to be a significant use in distinguishing between watershed delineation soil water preservation and management morphological analysis achieved within the jilledubanderu river basin shows that the catchment area has a low relief with elongated shape artificial recharge and run off harvesting in the field of research for the development of groundwater management are mainly selected on the basis of small scale topographic maps drainage analysis provides a positive contribution through rs and gis tools advantages above all based on the desire to artificial recharge structures the parameters have been analyzed to provide guidance on benchmarks for the permeability of rock surfaces in unique elements of the drainage basin if these facts are included in other hydrological characteristics of the catchment area the mode of recharge method and water harvesting measures provide better groundwater development and management plan magesh and chandrasekar 2014 rai et al 2017b the study region is having a dendritic drainage pattern may be due to more or less homogeneous significant lithology as well as the high dd shows the hilly terrain with impermeable hard rock and low dd regions over the particularly permeable sub soils and low relief regions are favourable for groundwater infiltration is contrawise with slope i e gentler is the slope higher is infiltration and much less runoff and vice versa rajasekhar et al 2020 5 conclusion and recommendation the detailed morphometric analysis of jiledubanderu river basin has been showcase the following facts 1 the morphometric analysis of jilledubanderu river basin reveals that it is designated as vith order stream and exhibits dendritic drainage pattern it implies that the rocks are highly homogeneous having uniform resistance to erosion in the horizontal direction however drainage pattern of the basin is mainly controlled by structure and lithology the simple geometric relationship between number order and length of streams of the basin as determined by the logarithmic transformation are in good agreement with the observed data such as the length of the basin is more to its width 2 the bifurcation ratio drainage density texture ratio and relief ratio of the basin reveals the rapid runoff low recharge and low rainfall intensities are prevailing in the area affecting the discharge potentialities of the main streams topography aspect and lithology of the basin have an important bearing on the hydrological characteristics of the basin 3 the mean bifurcation ratio indicates that the drainage pattern is not much distorted by geological structures the circularity ratio reveals early to late mature topography due to differences in slope relief and structural conditions the elongation ratio indicates that the strong relief and steep slopes characterize the basin 4 the river basin originates from the steep slope area most of the streams occur

12078,morphometry is a tool to search for groundwater resources through the studies of various landforms and drainage system the drainage pattern is an important prerequisite in evaluating the basin hydrology through the knowledge of morphometric parameters the system of streaming wherein the water reaches the streams is dependent upon the morphometric characteristics of the basin the extracted drainage network was classified according to strahler s system and it reveals that the basin exhibits dendritic to sub dendritic drainage pattern the jilledubanderu river basin is sprawled over an area of 486 95 km2 and forms a part of the chitravathi river system the study area is designated as sixth order basin and lower order streams mostly dominate the basin with the average drainage density of 1 96 km km2 the slope of basin varies from 0 to 35 and the slope variation is chiefly controlled by the local geology and erosion cycles the elongation ratio value is 0 66 indicating the basin has elongated shape with moderate relief and steep slopes the drainage texture of the basin is 5 69 which indicate an intermediate texture that exists over the region hence from the study it can be concluded that remote sensing data srtm dem coupled with geospatial techniques prove to be a competent tool in morphometric analysis and the data can be used for basin management and other hydrological studies in future graphical abstract image 1 keywords srtm dem morphometry remote sensing gis watershed management 1 introduction watershed is a geo hydrological unit draining run off water at a common point and it could be determined based on ridge and gully regions hydrologically watershed could be defined as an area from which run off drains to a particular point in a drainage system since water follows a definite flow course watershed becomes an ideal hydrologic unit for conducting the developmental activity related to water management singh et al 2014 yadav et al 2014 kanhaiya et al 2019 singh et al 2018a patel and srivastava 2013 patel et al 2012 watershed approach for optimal planning development and management aims at harnessing all natural resources for sustainable development and better living the factors that play a vital role in the planning and development are the watershed size shape physiography soils soil erosion zones landuse landcover hydrogeological setting etc with the help of remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis it is now possible to gain appreciation of resources from larger basinal areas in a very short period and in a more comprehensive manner than the conventional ground surveys patel et al 2012 strahler 1957a strahler and chow 1964a avinash et al 2011 singh and kanhaiya 2015 morphometric characteristics of many river basins and sub basins in different parts of the world have been studied using conventional methods patel et al 2013 srivastava et al 2008 various researchers have analyzed the morphometric parameters to explore the physiographic settings of river basin using rs and gis methods geographic and geomorphologic features of the catchment area are used in hydrological

of different river basins in india using remote sensing and gis in recent years singh 1972 rs gis techniques are prevalent and an effective means of studying the relationship among spatial variables srivastava et al 2012a 2012b singh et al 2018b singh and srivastava 1974 gis being a very powerful analytical tool which can generate manipulate the files and processing of spatial data ensuring high quality results and effectively integrate thematic layers for geospatial perspectives singh et al 2013a a series of articles have been written and published on the morphometric analysis of the basin particularly the change in flow space time frequency and the drainage density of the basin in arid regions of anantapur district andhra pradesh india srivastava et al 2012c traditionally the river geomorphology studies in india depend on topography and drainage classification however in recent decades field studies on the characteristics and behaviour of the river channel as well as developments in the field of rs and gis have strengthened the river geomorphology kale and shejwalkar 2007 the present study focuses on the morphometric analysis of jilledubanderu river basin using rs gis technoligies which is the master consequent stream of chitravati river anantapur district andhra pradesh india 2 study area jilledubanderu river starts its journey from bukkapatnam reserved forest situated in anantapur district and has been selected for the present study this is the largest province in andhra pradesh with 19 130 km2 area and receives 563 mm average annual rainfall jilledubanderu rises in the south eastern region of anantapur the area affected by drought and extends from 77 48 34 e to 78 58 11 e longitude and 14 05 35 n to 14 26 45 n latitude fig 1 the area of the basin is 486 95 sq km2 and the perimeter is 143 38 km falling in the toposheets of 57j 3 57j 4 57 f 15 and 57 f 16 of scale 1 50 000 the river has several bar deposits and other morphological features along its course geologically this area comprises of five lithological units fig 2 starting from hard rock terrain along with an archaean peninsular gneissic complex of hornblende biotite gneiss granodiorite and lamprophyre gsi 2002 rajasekhar et al 2018 these granitic rocks are traversed by means of dolerite dykes in the north of catchment area of the basin an isolated patch of

hill on red granite fairly and shallow weathered pediplains pediment inselberg and structural hill of granite and granodiorite and dyke ridges are intruded into all of the 4 lithological formations various aspects of ground water prevalence distribution pleasant status of development of anantapur district had been elaborately mentioned the average well density in mandals blanketed inside the watershed ranges from 4 to 7 in line with square km and bukkapatnam mandal which occupies greater than 1 2 of the watershed is asserted as overexploited cgwb 2013 3 methodology morphometric analysis of the jilledubanderu river basin was carried out using the soi topographical maps 57 f 15 57 f 16 57 j 3 and 57 j 4 on a 1 50 000 scale the analysis includes the aspects such as stream order stream length stream length ratio elongation ratio circulatory ratio drainage density drainage texture and bifurcation ratio etc the drainage network of the basin was analyzed by following the procedures of horton 1945 and strahler 1964 soi topographic maps were georeferenced using wgs 84 datum universal transverse mercator utm zone 44n projection in arcgis desktop 10 4 in the present research an integrated use of multispectral satellite data srtm shuttle radar topographic mission dem digital elevation model and soi topographical sheets were utilized for the generation of database and extraction of numerous drainage parameters details of the data used are shown in table 1 the elevation and other characteristics of the study area are recorded by a global positioning system during fieldwork in this study the jilledubanderu river was delineated and drainage network was extracted using srtm dem 1 arc sec in conjunction with soi toposheets other necessary procedures are also provided as a repair dem and filling the sinks after completion of dem the flow direction was calculated for each pixel in order to generate a drainage network the flow accumulation was taken into account on the basis of flow direction of each cell horton 1932 morphometric parameters were analyzed and classified into 3 classes associated with their orientation in space they are linear aerial and relief aspects and calculated on the basis of the formulas shown in table 2 and also the flow chart of the methodology is illustrated in fig 3 4 results and discussion the quantitative morphometric analysis provides information about hydrological properties of the rocks that are exposed in the river basin drainage map of the study area provides a reliable measure of rock permeability and indicates the yield of the basin srtm dem 1 arc sec is acquired with a pixel size of 90 m and then used to calculate the slope and thematic river basin maps horton 1945 the evolution of the drainage system depends on geology rainfall except for exogenous and endogenous areas of knowledge linear aerial and relief aspects considerations have been evaluated through arcgis 10 4 software schumm 1956 the latest development in rs and gis tools is to evaluate the drainage basin more accurately and correctly assess the morphometric parameters with greater precision rs and gis data successfully applied to obtain spatial differences in drainage characteristics provide an overview of the hydrological conditions necessary for the development of river basin management strategies sahu et al 2017 it also gives a valid evidence of the relationship between water surveying integrative drainage analysis and subsurface geometry thus morphometric analysis is always different from region to region the soil in space and time controls water storage and most of these factors depend on later parameters such as 1 water source as rain water availability 2 drainage characteristics and act as a drainage characteristic invasion and control the behaviour of water on the surface of the field vertically and horizontally 3 lithology types and characteristics to control flow and storage management 4 the slope is another factor and controls the energy flow of water that plays a role in facilitating the flow of water into the basin parveen et al 2012 jilledubanderu river basin quantitative analysis has been done to analyze drainage properties using the arcgis 10 4 software linear and areal parameters are important and their relationship among the basin area perimeter basin length bifurcation ratio rb drainage density dd stream frequency fs circulatory ratio rc elongation ratio re etc information used on various morphometric and legal parameters is shown in table 2 4 1 stream number nu stream order nu refers to a hierarchical link between the individual fragments that pass into a drainage network in accordance with the horton principle the number of streams is negatively correlated with the order in which the stream number and the downward flow trend decrease rai et al 2017a the number of streams nu is shown in each order in table 3 the study region includes a dendritic drainage system that shows homogeneous subsurface beds in this study stream ordering was classified with a proposed methodology das and mukherjee 2005 strahler 1957b the streams were digitized from topographical maps and satellite imageries the stream order of study the region shown in fig 4 4 2 stream order the effectiveness of drainage development is related to stream magnitude so that the stream order is considered as an important parameter in a linear aspect of a drainage basin the first order streams have no tributaries strahler 1958 the second order streams have the tributaries of only first order channels a segment of third order is formed where 2 s order channels join when two third order segments join a fourth order channel is formed the same process continues up to sixth order strahler and chow 1964b accordingly the jilledubanderu basin is designated as a sixth order basin table 3 the lower number of streams in iii and iv orders indicates the matured topography adjacent to the stream whereas the higher number of streams in i and ii orders indicate the topography is still under erosion 4 3 stream length lu mean stream length lsm the stream length mean stream length and stream length ratio have been calculated using the gis based regulation proposed by horton 1945 the first order drainage is total 475 05 km in length second order has a length of 233 18 km third order has a length of 116 26 km fourth order covers a total length of 76 30 km fifth order cover a total length of 41 23 km sixth order streams covers a total length of 14 29 km and the total length of jilledubanderu river covering all these orders is 956 31 km table 3 therefore it is observed that the first order stream has the highest total stream length and the number of streams because they are distributed more effectively than the other orders the first order stream having more or less half of the stream length is ephemeral in dry season and rest of the season the stream is perennial the perennial length may decrease further upstream and may be shorter in the dry season with decreasing groundwater recharge kaliraj et al 2015 4 4 stream length ratio rl stream length ratio has an important relationship with surface flow discharge and erosional stage of the basin stream length ratio is the ratio of the mean length of the segments of the next lower order which tends to be constant throughout the successive orders of a basin singh et al 2013b the stream length ratio is calculated using the formula shown in table 2 the stream ratios of the jilledubanderu river basin range from 0 69 to 3 78 table 3 the variation in the stream length ratios may be due to the differences in slope and topographical conditions 4 5 stream frequency fs horton imputed the theory 1932 1945 which is unswervingly associated with geological properties the number of streams per unit area is called the stream frequency high frequency drainage characterized by a steep surface vegetation rare high surface runoff impermeable substrate and the high relief jilledubanderu basin flow rate value is 2 89 km2 which indicates the positive correlation with the drainage area density table 4 4 6 bifurcation ratio rb bifurcation ratio is the ratio of the number of streams of any given order to the number of segments of the higher stream order horton 1932 the bifurcation ratio is calculated by the formula shown in table 2 the bifurcation ratios among the streams of different orders in jilledubanderu basin the mean bifurcation ratio of the basin is 4 39 which indicates low rainfall shallow weathering and low dissection of the valley of the area under investigation the values of bifurcation ratio less than 5 suggested that the geological structures do not show any dominant influence on the drainage pattern arulbalaji and gurugnanam 2017 4 7 drainage density dd drainage density is a measure of the degree of drainage development within a basin it reflects the closeness of channel spacings attributing to differential weathering of various formations relief and rainfall in a basin area according to horton 1932 the drainage density is defined as the length of stream per unit of a drainage area divided by the area of the drainage basins the formula is shown in table 2 smith 1950 and strahler 1957 have described drainage density values less than 5 as coarse 5 to 13 7 as a medium between 13 7 and 155 3 as fineand greater than 155 3 as ultra fine chow 1964 is of the opinion that the low drainage density is favoured in regions of highly permeable sub soil materials under dense drainage density which is favoured in regions of weak or impermeable sub soil materials sparse vegetation and mountain relief smith 1950 the drainage density computed according to horton s formula in the jilledubanderu river basin is 1 96 km km2 fig 5 table 3 it suggests that the drainage density is low reflecting permeable sub surface stratum with dense vegetation and low relief 4 8 drainage texture t drainage texture is a measure of width of the channel spacing it depends on climate rainfall rock and soil type infiltration capacity relief and stage of development of drainage smith 1950 weak rocks produce fine texture while hard rocks develops coarse texture sparse vegetation of an arid climate causes the development of fine texture than those developed on similar rocks in a humid climate the texture of a rock depends upon vegetation and climatic conditions miller 1953 the drainage texture is computed by the formula shown in table 2 the drainage texture of the jilledubanderu basin is 5 69 per km table 3 gentle slopes and almost flat topography cause the fine texture with lesser rainfall intensity the intermediate texture may be attributed to sub humid climate with hard rock formations 4 9 elongation ratio re elongation ratio is the ratio between the diameter of a circle of the same area as the basin and the maximum basin length schumm 1956 the formula is shown in table 2 strahler 1964 states that the elongation ratio ranges from 0 6 to 1 over a wide variety of climatic and geological formations values of elongation ratio near to 1 are found in the typical regions of very low relief while values from 0 6 to 0 8 are generally associated with the strong relief and steep slopes pakhmode et al 2003 the elongation ratio of the jilledubanderu river basin is 0 66 it infers that the basin is elongated with strong relief and steep slopes due to the structural disturbances 4 10 circularity ratio rc circularity ratio is a quantitative expression of the shape of the basin it is defined as the ratio of basin area to the area of circle having the same perimeter as the basin rao 2009 and formula expressed in table 2 the circularity ratio is generally influenced by length frequency and gradient of streams of various orders rather than slope and drainage conditions of a basin low medium and high circularity ratio values are indicative of youth mature and old stages of the basin respectively the computed value of circularity ratio of the jilledubanderu river basin is 0 30 table 4 the circularity ratio indicates the early mature stage of the topography the difference in the circularity ratio values may be due to the variations in slope relief and structural conditions of the river basin 4 11 shape factor bs shape factor bs is the ratio of the square of the length of the basin bs of the study regions shows 2 88 value table 4 that indicate irregularity in shape of the basin 4 12 constant of channel maintenance c the constant of channel maintenance c is the inverse of drainage density dd the parameter can determine the area required to maintain a linear channel km flow in this factor c depends on the slope of the basin the lithology the esoteric vegetation and the erosion span however higher c values show a basin with higher permeability rocks and vice versa chopra et al 2005 the c value of the whole jilledubanderu river basin 0 36 table 4 indicates an average area of 0 51 km2 needed to maintain the stream flow length of 1 km 4 13 form factor ff form factor ff is a parameter that is used to predict the intensity of a basin in a particular area having a direct relationship to peak discharge horton 1945 ff can be defined as the ratio of the area of a basin and square of the basin length sreedevi et al 2005 the ff value will always be greater than 0 78 for an absolutely circular basin the lowest value means ff more elongated i e 0 35 table 4 indicates the elongated shape of the basin 4 14 basin relief r basin relief r is defined as the difference in elevation between the highest and the lowest points of the basin the r controls the stream gradient and therefore influences the flood patterns amount of the sediment transported and geomorphic processes and landform characteristic burrough et al 2015 it also contains information on the number of potential and kinetic energy that is reflected in the production of surface water runoff precipitation and flood in the basin the highest point in jilledubanderu basin is 548 m and the lowest 390 m thus the relief is 158 m table 5 showing a moderate slope low runoff and enhanced infiltration in the basin 4 15 relief ratio rr maximum relief of the horizontal distance along the longest dimension of basin along the main drainage line indicated as a relief ratio rr schumm 1956 the rr is a comprehensive slope catchment area and is an indicator of the intensity of erosion process on the working basin slope schumm 1956 if the value rr is high it indicates hilly terrain and low value of rr represents pediplain and valley maathuis and wang 2006 understanding the distribution of slope is of vital importance it provides information on the planning of human settlements agricultural opportunities afforestation and engineering construction plans the rr of jilledubanderu basin shows 0 24 rr value indicates moderate sediment transport and flow of erosion table 5 rr usually increases with decreasing size of the drainage basin 4 16 aspect map the aspect map is usually related to the direction of the slope face aspect map is an absolutely important parameter for understanding the impact of the sun shine on the site of the neighbourhood time in general to the west with a slope that reflects the hottest during the day and in most cases the western side with a slope may be warmer than a sheltered slope on the eastern side maathuis and wang 2006 aspect map has an important consequences in the distribution of field vegetation form the aspect map derived from srtm dem represents the compass route 0 is north with time 90 issue to the east fig 6 the jilledubanderu basin offers east facing slopes and thus these slopes have a higher moisture content and higher vegetation than in the western slope 4 17 slope map the slope is a measure of changes in surface values at a distance and can be expressed in degrees or as a percentage dem raster format is a grid in which each cell represents a value compared to a common reference point after calculating the slope the maximum difference and slope can be identified jha et al 2007 kudnar and rajasekhar 2020 map results are used to create a map of biased neighbourhood s usage of arcgis 10 4 spatial analyst tools maximum topographic height 548 m and 158 low amsl exists in the western and north western part of site size causing the highest outflow and therefore much less chance of raining infiltration tilted study area map is grouped into five classes namely 1 3 gentle 3 5 moderate 5 10 steep 100 35 very steep and 35 very very steep fig 7 it is found that a large part of the jilledubanderu basin area under gentle and slight slopes suggest nearly flat topography of the region gentle slopes have been certain inside the remarkable category for groundwater control because the almost flat terrain is mostly favourable for infiltration moderate slopes also fall into the accurate area due to a slightly hilly relief that gives partial runoff the steep magnificence and having an excessive floor runoff with a negligible quantity of infiltration are marked under precise area for construction of dams and so forth the slope is an essential parameter without which delay controls runoff and infiltration of any terrain prabhakaran and raj 2018 runoff in greater slope areas causes less infiltration such component significantly needs the improvement of aquifers 4 18 hydrological interferences from morphometric analysis quantitative assessment of morphometric parameters has been set to be a significant use in distinguishing between watershed delineation soil water preservation and management morphological analysis achieved within the jilledubanderu river basin shows that the catchment area has a low relief with elongated shape artificial recharge and run off harvesting in the field of research for the development of groundwater management are mainly selected on the basis of small scale topographic maps drainage analysis provides a positive contribution through rs and gis tools advantages above all based on the desire to artificial recharge structures the parameters have been analyzed to provide guidance on benchmarks for the permeability of rock surfaces in unique elements of the drainage basin if these facts are included in other hydrological characteristics of the catchment area the mode of recharge method and water harvesting measures provide better groundwater development and management plan magesh and chandrasekar 2014 rai et al 2017b the study region is having a dendritic drainage pattern may be due to more or less homogeneous significant lithology as well as the high dd shows the hilly terrain with impermeable hard rock and low dd regions over the particularly permeable sub soils and low relief regions are favourable for groundwater infiltration is contrawise with slope i e gentler is the slope higher is infiltration and much less runoff and vice versa rajasekhar et al 2020 5 conclusion and recommendation the detailed morphometric analysis of jiledubanderu river basin has been showcase the following facts 1 the morphometric analysis of jilledubanderu river basin reveals that it is designated as vith order stream and exhibits dendritic drainage pattern it implies that the rocks are highly homogeneous having uniform resistance to erosion in the horizontal direction however drainage pattern of the basin is mainly controlled by structure and lithology the simple geometric relationship between number order and length of streams of the basin as determined by the logarithmic transformation are in good agreement with the observed data such as the length of the basin is more to its width 2 the bifurcation ratio drainage density texture ratio and relief ratio of the basin reveals the rapid runoff low recharge and low rainfall intensities are prevailing in the area affecting the discharge potentialities of the main streams topography aspect and lithology of the basin have an important bearing on the hydrological characteristics of the basin 3 the mean bifurcation ratio indicates that the drainage pattern is not much distorted by geological structures the circularity ratio reveals early to late mature topography due to differences in slope relief and structural conditions the elongation ratio indicates that the strong relief and steep slopes characterize the basin 4 the river basin originates from the steep slope area most of the streams occur in comparatively plain lands and the sub surface stratum are permeable therefore the plains are an important locations for constructing an artificial recharge structures for augmenting the groundwater

12079,this study aimed to determine the groundwater quality index wqi and investigate the anthropogenic factors causing changes in this index in shiraz plain this research studied the quality of groundwater of 35 wells for five years groundwater samples were analyzed for ph tds th hco3 1 cl 1 f 1 so4 2 ca 2 mg 2 no3 1 and na 1 and a microbial parameter was analyzed to compute the water quality index wqi factors affecting was evaluated using field studies google earth and multivariate statistical analysis and piper diagram the computed wqi values ranged from 40 01 to 117 38 overall 5 7 of groundwater sites sampled had excellent water quality while 65 7 were good 28 6 of the samples indicated poor water quality the zoning results showed that the water quality index wqi was worsening from northwest to southeast and from northeast to southeast the correlation between water quality index wqi and changes in industrial land use and between water quality index wqi and changes in the unused lands were 0 46 and 0 35 respectively principal component analysis pca on the chemical parameters revealed two factors that account for about 77 44 of the total variance in groundwater quality data set the first factor with high eigen values indicates that variation in water quality is due to natural origin according to the results of hierarchical cluster analysis hca there are three quality groups in groundwater of the research area the first group of 8 wells the second group of 11 wells and the third group of 16 wells in this context the piper diagram also indicates groundwater facies of the study area were ca2 mg2 hco3 this is also due to water interaction the limestone of a karst aquifer the groundwater hydro chemical in the study area is the majority of human activity but it is influenced to some degree by the natural process graphical abstract image 1 keywords estimation water quality index drinking groundwater affecting factors 1 introduction the area geology and aquifer properties determine the groundwater quality and it is greatly influenced by many factors including natural and anthropogenic activities o driscoll et al 2010 jalili et al 2018 groundwater quality in a region is a function of physical and chemical parameters that are strongly influenced by natural processes such as water chemistry in the recharged area water intermixing groundwater recharge aquifer discharge and recharge water flow path the interplay between aquifer rock minerals and water oxidation reduction process water residence time ion exchange climatic conditions and geological structures singh et al 2017 azhdarpoor et al 2019 soleimani et al 2018 some crystals such as carbonates dissolve more rapidly in water and change the composition of water more quickly in contrast other minerals such as silicates dissolve more slowly and have less obvious effects on water composition özdemir 2016 badeenezhad et al 2019a kumar et al 2007 akbari et al 2018 abbasnia et al 2019 also anthropogenic activities such as extended pumping of the aquifer infiltration of wastewater and agricultural fertilizers leakage and so on affect the quality of groundwater groundwater chemical properties determine water suitability for industrial agricultural or domestic use mallick et al 2018 singh et al 2019 salehi et al 2020 radfarda et al 2019 kumar et al 2006 2009a 2010 groundwater quality and quantity are affected by increasing urbanization it has been observed that bare and farmland and other low populated lands have become dense settlements that have changed the hydrology of the area these changes contain increased water salinity and nitrogen compounds as well as microbiological contamination and petroleum products contamination khazaei et al 2004 badeenezhad et al 2019b kumar et al 2006 singh et al 2019 sharafi et al 2012 evidence also shows that with increasing urbanization more than half of the rainwater flows and only a portion of it penetrates the lower layers of soil thus it can be said that extreme urbanization and its subsequent changes in the land use and land cover has many undesirable effects on the local ecology patra et al 2018 kumar et al 2009b 2011 2016a 2017 mirzaei et al 2017 das et al 2017 multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca can illustrate the relationship between large numbers of variables and describe the relationship between them iranmanesh et al 2014 kumar et al 2013 2016b 2019b singh et al 2020a 2020b hca categorizes any number and any type of variables involved physical chemical and biological into two or more categories based on the similarity between the samples according to a set of specific characteristics and the results can be more easily interpreted in the hydro chemical context or geological however pca explains covariance relationships among the variables and decreases the number of variables and also the structure of the relationship between variables noshadi and ghafourian 2016 radfarda et al 2019 singh et al 2008 2020b kumar et al 2019 therefore these analyses will help us to have a comprehensive understanding of the effective hydro chemical mechanisms approximately 75 78 primary drinking water sources in the shiraz city are supplied by deep 300 350 m and semi deep 150 m wells in shiraz plain which are mainly located in the urban areas or suburbs also on the same basis the groundwater aquifer of shiraz plain is divided into two surface and deep aquifers the surface table starts from the free surface of the groundwater and extends to a depth of about 40 m and the deep surface of the groundwater extends from a depth of about 40 m 200 m the hydraulic gradient ranges from 0 001 to 0 006 amiri et al 2015 despite the development of the municipal sewage collection network in recent decades they have a high pollution potential for groundwater shiraz plain consists of two types of aquifer coarse grained alluvium and karstic aquifer oligo miocene carbonate is formed from the asmari jahrom miocene marl from the razak formation and polio pleistocene conglomerate from the bakhtyari formation form the circumambient geological settings in the study area the north karstic aquifer of shiraz plain is connected to the alluvial aquifer amiri et al 2015 baghapour et al 2016 it seems that extensive pumping in the northern karst aquifer has reversed the groundwater flow direction and consequently water from the alluvial aquifer enters the karstic aquifer badeenezhad et al 2017 this situation may lead to change or decrease in the groundwater quality in the shiraz plain theretofore extensive water mining to fulfill the domestic industrial and agricultural needs could largely effect the aquifer characteristic and natural composition of water quality of the study area the objective of the study was including a investigate the groundwater quality in the urban

precautions in collection and handling sample steps were taken to minimize any contamination each sample was analyzed for 12 parameters of ca 2 mg 2 na hco3 cl so4 2 f ph total hardness th no3 tds and e coli by standard analytical methods and procedures federation and association 2005 shi et al 2018 na was determined using ﬂame photometer mg 2 ca 2 and hco3 1 was analyzed by the titrimetric method no3 cl total hardness so4 2 were analyzed by digital spectrophotometer model dr 5000 tds were determined by a conductivity meter meternmer 500 f was determined using spadns method and a dr 5000 spectrophotometer analyses were repeated until we reached 95 accuracy and 5 precision computing wqi includes three stages at first 12 parameters of ca 2 mg 2 na hco3 cl so4 2 f ph total hardness th tds and e coli were selected considering the relative importance of each parameter on groundwater quality for drinking purposes and also based on their perceived effects on primary health a weight wi rating 1 5 was assigned to each parameter the maximum weight i e 5 was given to such parameters as tds and nitrate since it is the most crucial index for groundwater quality evaluation in study area 4 to so4 2 th and ph 3 to cl 2 to ca 2 mg 2 na and 1 to hco3 due to its role in groundwater quality evaluation in the next step the relative weight wi was computed for each parameter by eq 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i wi is the relative weight wi is the weight assigned to each parameter and n is the number of parameters jayalakshmi and velappan 2015 in the third stage quality rating scale qi of each parameter was assigned by dividing its amount of measured parameters in each sample by its respective standard value according to who guidelines and the result was multiplied by 100 2 q i c i s i 100 where qi is the relative quality scale for each parameter ci is the concentration of each parameter in the groundwater sample mg l and si is the who s guidelines for each parameter mg l finally to calculate the wqi we determined the sub index sii for each chemical parameter by eq 3 the sum of sii was calculated as the wqi value using eq 4 khosravi et al 2017 deepak and singh 2013 kalra et al 2012 3 s i i w i q i 4 w q i s i i sii is the sub index of its parameter qi is the relative quality of its parameter wi is the number of parameters and wqi is the water quality index the calculated wqi values are classified into six types excellent to unsuitable for drinking in this study the wqi from 2013 to 2017 was separately determined in each year in this study the sampling locations were imported through point layer into arcgis 10 3 software for preparation of zoning maps inverse distance weighting idw was used for the interpolation map of wqi 5 years on the plain of shiraz the existence or absence of sanitary protection in the radius around each well construction of a sewage collection network in the areas near the wells location of the wells relative to the slope and environmental factors and external surface use at a radius of 400 m were investigated using field visits and surveys as well as land use mapping 2 3 determining land use and their changes to determine the area and percentage of land usage and their differences in the radius of each well two land use maps one year before and one year after the study period 2012 and 2018 were based on the maps obtained from google earth software to do this we entered the coordinates of the wells previously provided by the gps into the arcview gis after the wells were located then the buffer function determined the radius 400 what around each well and it was added to google earth with the help of this function the land use map of 2012 was discontinued in the study area the area was cut in a radius of 400 m around each well a total of 4 land use groups in this space included agricultural coverage and green spaces industrial and road residential and urban areas as well as empty space in the radius around each well these calculations and operations were performed for all 35 studied wells in the first year 2012 also the same operation was repeated for the land use map of the final year 2018 as the second map to determine the percentage of each land use land cover and comparison with the previous land use map 2012 to determine variations of them for each well 2 4 multivariate statistical analysis the hydro chemical data total of 175 samples was statistically analyzed with hca and pca to identify the most weighted hca is a group of multivariate techniques which mainly classify the variables or cases into a cluster with high homogeneity level within the category and high heterogeneity level between the categories the spatial variability of groundwater sample points was determined by hca the results of hca help in interpreting the data and indicate patterns and provides the results in an understandable dendrogram kumar 2013 khelif and boudoukha 2018 for this reason first the mean parameters studied for each sample site were calculated over five years using the pearson correlation test the relationship between wqi and land use area was analyzed in four main groups as well as the depth of wells pca is a multivariate statistical technique used for data reduction with a view to specifying the sources of elements and their controlling factors it enables the locative distribution of the resulting factors to be determined the land use area was analyzed in four main groups as well as the depth of wells to determine the relationship between the existence and absence of sanitary protection construction and the lack of creation of a sewage collection network and the position of each well to the flow of groundwater with wqi t test was used for the calculation of mean and standard deviation of each of the two groups of wells two groups with options yes and no 3 results and discussion understanding groundwater quality is necessary due to its principal factors for potable suitability usage shabbir and ahmad 2015 the statistical analysis of chemicals and physical parameters of groundwater samples including minimum maximum and the mean values are reported in table 1 the ionic dominance pattern is in the order of ca 2 mg 2 na and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 for cations and anions respectively moreover ca 2and hco3 was shown in the high concentration among the cations and anions respectively in the groundwater of the study area the na 1 concentration in the groundwater varies between 12 and 160 mg l with a mean value of 49 7 mg l according to who standards 2011 who 2011 all groundwater samples were within the maximum allowable limit of 200 mg l for sodium in the study area the ca 2 and mg 2 concentrations were 34 to 5 to 114 6 and 8 to 172 32 respectively cationic concentrations and ratios can be used to understand reactive processes between rocks and water such as weathering and cationic exchange the maximum permissible limit of mg2 for drinking water is 150 mg l which results reveal that 94 3 of collected groundwater samples are within the portable range for drinking purposes who 2011 the higher contents of magnesium in water are due to gypsum and anhydrite dissolution in the groundwater khelif and boudoukha 2018 chloride generally considered as an index of water pollution and also higher concentration gives a salty taste to water and have a laxative effect moreover it derives mainly from the domestic wastage industrial wastes and municipal effluents in the present study area chloride concentration ranged from 7 to 156 mg l with a mean of 71 mg l the desirable limit of chloride in potable water is 200 mg l in who standards 2011 for drinking water the results of the present study determined that all groundwater samples were within the desirable limit for drinking water chloride generally considered as an index of water pollution and also higher concentration gives a salty taste to water and have a laxative effect moreover it derives mainly from the domestic wastage industrial wastes and municipal effluents adimalla et al 2018 fluoride in low dosage affects dental hygiene higher values of fluoride lead to skeletal fluorosis saleem et al 2016 fluoride concentration was observed from 0 4 to 0 72 mg l in different samples thus the fluoride values at 139 samples were found to be under the acceptable range specified in who standards 2011 for drinking water who 2011 no3 values ranging from 4 to 70 mg l with an average of 25 57 mg l 6 of samples had a higher nitrate concentration than who standard and these samples were obtained from two wells because of the lack of nitrate in most geologic formations no3 concentrations 5 mg l are generally indicative of water contamination by anthropogenic sources such as animal waste fertilizer and or effluent adimalla and qian 2019 total dissolved solids tds value ranged from 153 to 898 7 mg l with an average of 614 5 mg l water can be classified based on tds values into freshwater 1000 ppm slightly saline water 1000 3000 ppm moderately saline water 3000 10 000 ppm and highly saline water 10 000 35000 ppm adimalla and qian 2019 all the samples fell in the freshwater category a piper diagram was created using the analytical data obtained from the hydro chemical analysis of groundwater fig 2 it indicates that the groundwater is of the calcium bicarbonate ca2 mg2 hco3 type assessment of the water types by piper plot suggests that there is a clear indication of the contribution from the weathering in the hard rocks kumar et al 2013 the calcium bicarbonate water resulted mainly from the dissolution of limestone frisbee et al 2016 the dominance of ca 2 in the groundwater samples collected from the region with more slope suggested an inverse ion exchange process ravikumar and somashekar 2017 high hco3 values in groundwater samples are due to the dissolution of limestone in a karst aquifer since bicarbonate was significant in all the groundwater samples obtained water buffering capacity in the study areas was primarily maintained this high buffering capacity has hindered many changes of ph baghapour et al 2016 3 1 wqi determination and zoning the wqi summarizes a significant number of various parameters of groundwater quality in a general method into a single number and it is a helpful technique to assess and manage the groundwater resources damo and icka 2013 weight and relative weight of each parameter in who standards are shown in table 2 the classification of wqi for groundwater sample points is presented in table 3 if the wqi is less than 50 water has excellent quality water is characterized by an index between 50 and 100 water of adequate quality the index in the range of 100 200 indicates poor water quality and the index between 200 and 300 and more represents a very poor quality showing improper drinking water the results of this study showed that the quality index of drinking water in the study area was in the range of 38 63 166 1 of the total two wells had excellent quality 23 had a good quality index and 10 had low and poor quality the results are shown in fig 2 along with the study period 2013 2017 according to these maps the quality index of drinking water from the northwest to the northeast has increased the two wells 31 and 35 which have a good quality index are located in the northwestern part of shiraz plain the same results zoned are shown in fig 2 and also during the study period 2013 2017 according to these maps the quality index of drinking water from the northwest to the northeast has increased the wells no 31 and 35 which have a good quality index are located in the northwest of shiraz plain these wells have the most abundant free space within a radius of 400 m and at the same time they have less residential and urban usage than the other wells in this region wells no 32 34 have a weaker quality index these wells are located at the point of adjacent tissue binding to calcareous tissue near an urban area a survey of the piezometric level in the area indicated that water harvesting exceeds the water balance water level which has caused the groundwater to flow to the calcareous wells unlike the slope direction of the alluvial texture resulting in lower quality water entering the wells the results of a study by doza in bangladesh showed that the entry of sewage into aquifer and agricultural activities in the area around the wells was due to low groundwater quality bodrud doza et al 2016 according to the zoning map fig 3 wells located in the eastern and southeastern parts of the city center and the center have the highest quality index so that the average total wqi index in the wells of these areas was higher than 100 it seems that the proximity of the wells to urban and residential contexts and the high density of the residential area the movement of pollutants from the upper regions towards these wells has reduced the quality of drinking water in these areas wells no 20 and 21 in this area are located in a vineyard farm the results of field studies have shown that 5 10 tons of organic fertilizers per hectare are used annually to fertilize this field the value of the qualitative index of these two wells was 67 and 68 indicating that agricultural activities did not affect the quality of wells in the studied wells the interpolation map and spatial analysis of the sample points showed that the safest zone was groundwater from the northwest region these wells have the lowest values of wqi among all the wells studied in the five years 2013 2017 on the other hand it seems that discharge groundwater rate is increased widely leading to increase of contaminants and minerals into groundwater hence the groundwater quality was degraded 3 2 wqi value variation trend a comparison of the mean wqi in the 5 year period of 2013 2017 is shown in fig 4 in this graph the mean of wqi from a total of 35 wells in each year was analyzed then the mean was compared fluctuation trend of wqi quantities showed that in 2014 groundwater quality had relatively increased and it was constant in 2015 2016 which was probably due to wastewater collection network completion the wqi trend in 2017 was incremental since few wells are located in sedimentary tissue pollutant remanded in sedimentary layer for years therefore in spite of the construction of the wastewater collection network the quality was slightly increased also the wells with the highest values of wqi poor quality gradually increased this shows that the contaminant points of shiraz plain require serious control plan 3 3 multivariate statistical analysis the analytical results of pca were performed for the set of 35 wells and 11 variables the result of this analysis is shown as a tree diagram in fig 5 there are three distinct clusters at interval 5 from this dendrogram we can find the relationship between different wells the first group includes 8 wells the well numbers 20 29 35 the second one contains 11 wells well numbers 1 6 8 11 and 21 and the third group consists of 16 wells the well numbers 7 12 19 and 22 28 the results showed that the first group wells had the lowest values of anions and cations supplementary 1 wells with excellent wqi are in this category this group is located in the upstream of the urban area on the drak mountain foothills and it has the highest atmospheric charge and the least water interacts with the aquifer environment the result showed that the concentration of parameters studied in the second group was significantly more than the first group the majority of these wells are in the poor water quality category these wells are located close to residential areas and they are the margin of the urban region the third group wells have the highest values of tds total hardness and ions hydro chemistry of groundwater samples in the third group is likely to originate from rock weathering also it seems that the location of these wells in the contaminated groundwater passage path and an increase in the interaction of water with the environment have led to an increase in the concentration of the parameters pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relationship between physical and chemical parameters of water samples and the results are presented in the supplementary 2 factor analysis was performed using principal component analysis and varimax rotation of water components including th t d s no3 cl na so4 2 mg 2 ca 2 hco3 ph and f table 4 other variables were calculated by the sum of the variance of each observed variable in the constructed factor and an amount of eigen sum of squared loading factor equal to one was used as a criterion to enter an extra factor in the model finally based on factor analysis factor loadings equal to than 0 5 were considered acceptable based on the eigenvalues higher than one and scree plot supplementary 2 two independent factors were extracted which illustrate 77 44 of the total variance the pc1 was responsible for 65 23 of the total difference and it was best represented by total hard t d s no3 cl na so4 2 mg 2 ca 2and hco3 and a negative loading by ph this may represent the primary impacts of the precipitation dissolution processes of minerals such as gypsum dolomite calcite and silicates probably strong loadings of t d s no3 cl and na are due to pollutants transfer such as domestic wastewater from the surface and subsurface layers to groundwater resources pc2 explained 12 21 of the total variance and it was mostly participated by ph and f it seems that the fluoride ion f normally remains non reactive for groundwater with ph 7 0 because of its low solubility and remains absorbed in clay or exchangeable materials however in this study area due to alkaline ph once the ph of groundwater goes beyond 7 0 i e alkaline medium the hydroxyl group oh replace the exchangeable fluoride as kaolinite clay minerals t et al 2017 molekoa et al 2019 the results of table 5 show that wells located on groundwater flow have an average wqi of 105 28 11 85 even though the wells that were not in the direction of the gradient had a mean value of 76 2 18 7 it is indicated that when we are getting closer to drinking water in the city center and close to the drinking water in these areas the quality of drinking water will be reduced on the other hand these results indicate that the location and construction of wells in these areas were not done accurately also wells without sanitary protection had an average qualitative index of 109 74 10 65 and wells with sanitary protection had an average wqi of 78 2 18 7 these results showed that wells that had no sources of pollutants in a radius of 400 m mostly consisted of empty space which had a higher quality it seems that the construction of new wells in areas where construction and urban and agricultural development has not occurred is necessary given that wastewater produced in urban and residential areas was previously repelled through absorbing wells the produced wastewater at the closest distance had entered the aquifers and piezometric level of groundwater table 6 shows the correlation between drinking water quality index and land use and their changes based on this table the correlation coefficient between the quality index and depth of wells is 0 4 p 0 00 accordingly there was a linear and an inverse relationship between the depth of the wells and the water quality index the higher the depth the better the water quality it seems that with increasing depth of the wells the surface and subsurface contaminants can go down into the wells and down aquifers the results are consistent with other studies exner et al 2014 juntakut et al 2019 the highest correlation was obtained between the quality index with residential use 0 44 and secondly the vacant and unused lands 0 68 p 0 00 this is because the development of residential and urban areas has a direct role in the creation and transmission of contamination to the underlying layers of the soil and the reduction of groundwater quality the negative sign indicates that as the free space around the wells is higher the quality index is lower which means that the layers of soil above the aquifer are less affected hence the aquifer layer filtering function plays its part in maintaining the quality of the aquifer properly the results of the study showed that economic development had a significant and sudden impact on the reduction of groundwater quality in arid areas mainali and chang 2018 meanwhile user variations such as the use of residential and urban 0 49 and industrial 0 46 lands correlate more with quality degradation and this amount of unused land is 35 this finding shows that part of the vacant space around the wells has been declining and has become a reality for residential and industrial applications resulting in the rapid growth of pollution and their penetration into the underlying layers and since much of the aquifer texture is of calcareous type it has led to the faster entry of pollutants into deeper layers 3 4 correlation analysis and land use land cover change fig 6 shows the changes of the wqi in the studied period in 35 wells during the two years at the beginning and the end of the study duration indicating the effects of anthropogenic factors on the quality of drinking water of these resources and the change of the quality index as a result of this the qualitative index of wells has increased substantially the two wells 25 and 26 in this figure have suffered from a reduction in water quality but the quality deterioration in the well no 25 was more investigating the land use change showed that the highest industrial use in the area of these two wells occurred in 3 5 and 3 9 ha in well no 25 the residential use has increased by 3 6 ha indicating that the effects of increased industrial use combined with residential use together have led to significant changes in water quality the results of a study in nebraska usa showed that the most factors affecting the increased nitrate concentration were respectively depth of wells the presence of sand in the 1 5 m of the upper layer of the soil and hydraulic conductivity exner et al 2014 furthermore fig 7 shows the differences in each of the 4 land usage in the vicinity of the 35 wells in a graph based on this graph the most changes around the water wells are the use of vacant residential and urban spaces which means that empty space has a decreasing state and residential and urban usage has increased this indicates an increase in population density and also urban and residential development as a result of a reduction in vacant space in the radius around the water wells of the studied area this has led to an increase in the entry of contaminants and sewage into groundwater resulting in reduced quality 4 conclusion multivariate statistical methods pca hca and pearson correlation water quality index and arcview gis are applied to characterize the water quality which is a significant factor for controlling the groundwater quality in terms of drinking purposes the results showed that 5 7 of the samples samples taken from two wells had wqi in the excellent range while 65 7 sampling samples from 23 wells had a good quality index also 28 6 samples taken from 10 wells had poor quality according to the hydro chemical analysis results from the piper diagram showed that there were main hydro chemical facies in the shiraz plain area that was cahco3 two components are extracted using the pca pc1 which illustrates the greatest variance represents a mixed efficacy natural process such as precipitation dissolution processes and anthropogenic activity like urban land use water intrudes in the groundwater chemistry three different clusters are obtained through hca wells in the first group are located at drak mountain foothills and these wells less effect on the human activity and natural process the wells of the third group have the highest tds total hardness and ions values which seems to be due to the proximity of these wells to the wastewater contaminated in the urban area which originates from rock weathering wells with poor quality index generally had the highest density of urban and residential texture in their radius of 400 m furthermore wells that have sanitary protection and are constructed of a sewage collection network in the nearby urban context have a better quality than other wells pearson correlation analysis between land use change and wqi showed that variations of residential urban and industrial use had the highest correlation and this amount of unused lands is 35 the results of this study showed that the water quality index is worsening from northwest to southeast and from northeast to southeast therefore it can be concluded that the quality of groundwater located in the urban area is getting worse this decrease in water quality is mainly due to the lack of sanitary protection around each well rock weathering water rock interaction inappropriate location of wells changes in unused land for other purposes industrial and residential and also urban and residential development in wells declaration of competing interest

12079,this study aimed to determine the groundwater quality index wqi and investigate the anthropogenic factors causing changes in this index in shiraz plain this research studied the quality of groundwater of 35 wells for five years groundwater samples were analyzed for ph tds th hco3 1 cl 1 f 1 so4 2 ca 2 mg 2 no3 1 and na 1 and a microbial parameter was analyzed to compute the water quality index wqi factors affecting was evaluated using field studies google earth and multivariate statistical analysis and piper diagram the computed wqi values ranged from 40 01 to 117 38 overall 5 7 of groundwater sites sampled had excellent water quality while 65 7 were good 28 6 of the samples indicated poor water quality the zoning results showed that the water quality index wqi was worsening from northwest to southeast and from northeast to southeast the correlation between water quality index wqi and changes in industrial land use and between water quality index wqi and changes in the unused lands were 0 46 and 0 35 respectively principal component analysis pca on the chemical parameters revealed two factors that account for about 77 44 of the total variance in groundwater quality data set the first factor with high eigen values indicates that variation in water quality is due to natural origin according to the results of hierarchical cluster analysis hca there are three quality groups in groundwater of the research area the first group of 8 wells the second group of 11 wells and the third group of 16 wells in this context the piper diagram also indicates groundwater facies of the study area were ca2 mg2 hco3 this is also due to water interaction the limestone of a karst aquifer the groundwater hydro chemical in the study area is the majority of human activity but it is influenced to some degree by the natural process graphical abstract image 1 keywords estimation water quality index drinking groundwater affecting factors 1 introduction the area geology and aquifer properties determine the groundwater quality and it is greatly influenced by many factors including natural and anthropogenic activities o driscoll et al 2010 jalili et al 2018 groundwater quality in a region is a function of physical and chemical parameters that are strongly influenced by natural processes such as water chemistry in the recharged area water intermixing groundwater recharge aquifer discharge and recharge water flow path the interplay between aquifer rock minerals and water oxidation reduction process water residence time ion exchange climatic conditions and geological structures singh et al 2017 azhdarpoor et al 2019 soleimani et al 2018 some crystals such as carbonates dissolve more rapidly in water and change the composition of water more quickly in contrast other minerals such as silicates dissolve more slowly and have less obvious effects on water composition özdemir 2016 badeenezhad et al 2019a kumar et al 2007 akbari et al 2018 abbasnia et al 2019 also anthropogenic activities such as extended pumping of the aquifer infiltration of wastewater and agricultural fertilizers leakage and so on affect the quality of groundwater groundwater chemical properties determine water suitability for industrial agricultural or domestic use mallick et al 2018 singh et al 2019 salehi et al 2020 radfarda et al 2019 kumar et al 2006 2009a 2010 groundwater quality and quantity are affected by increasing urbanization it has been observed that bare and farmland and other low populated lands have become dense settlements that have changed the hydrology of the area these changes contain increased water salinity and nitrogen compounds as well as microbiological contamination and petroleum products contamination khazaei et al 2004 badeenezhad et al 2019b kumar et al 2006 singh et al 2019 sharafi et al 2012 evidence also shows that with increasing urbanization more than half of the rainwater flows and only a portion of it penetrates the lower layers of soil thus it can be said that extreme urbanization and its subsequent changes in the land use and land cover has many undesirable effects on the local ecology patra et al 2018 kumar et al 2009b 2011 2016a 2017 mirzaei et al 2017 das et al 2017 multivariate statistical techniques such as principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca can illustrate the relationship between large numbers of variables and describe the relationship between them iranmanesh et al 2014 kumar et al 2013 2016b 2019b singh et al 2020a 2020b hca categorizes any number and any type of variables involved physical chemical and biological into two or more categories based on the similarity between the samples according to a set of specific characteristics and the results can be more easily interpreted in the hydro chemical context or geological however pca explains covariance relationships among the variables and decreases the number of variables and also the structure of the relationship between variables noshadi and ghafourian 2016 radfarda et al 2019 singh et al 2008 2020b kumar et al 2019 therefore these analyses will help us to have a comprehensive understanding of the effective hydro chemical mechanisms approximately 75 78 primary drinking water sources in the shiraz city are supplied by deep 300 350 m and semi deep 150 m wells in shiraz plain which are mainly located in the urban areas or suburbs also on the same basis the groundwater aquifer of shiraz plain is divided into two surface and deep aquifers the surface table starts from the free surface of the groundwater and extends to a depth of about 40 m and the deep surface of the groundwater extends from a depth of about 40 m 200 m the hydraulic gradient ranges from 0 001 to 0 006 amiri et al 2015 despite the development of the municipal sewage collection network in recent decades they have a high pollution potential for groundwater shiraz plain consists of two types of aquifer coarse grained alluvium and karstic aquifer oligo miocene carbonate is formed from the asmari jahrom miocene marl from the razak formation and polio pleistocene conglomerate from the bakhtyari formation form the circumambient geological settings in the study area the north karstic aquifer of shiraz plain is connected to the alluvial aquifer amiri et al 2015 baghapour et al 2016 it seems that extensive pumping in the northern karst aquifer has reversed the groundwater flow direction and consequently water from the alluvial aquifer enters the karstic aquifer badeenezhad et al 2017 this situation may lead to change or decrease in the groundwater quality in the shiraz plain theretofore extensive water mining to fulfill the domestic industrial and agricultural needs could largely effect the aquifer characteristic and natural composition of water quality of the study area the objective of the study was including a investigate the groundwater quality in the urban environment using water quality index wqi b classified the sampling sites based on the water quality parameters with the help of hierarchical cluster analysis hca analysis c evaluate the water type of the study area and inter element relationship by using of piper and principal component analysis pca analysis respectively and d determining the effect of land use changes on groundwater quality variations using google earth geographic information system gis software and correlation analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area shiraz is the capital of fars province and located in the southern region of iran this city lies between longitude 52 29 e 52 36 and latitude 29 33 and 29 36 n the geological structure of shiraz includes asmari and razak the razak the structure is more in the residential and urban sectors the shiraz plain is limited by bamu drak poshte mole and baba koohi mountains from the north and northwest amiri et al 2015 fig 1 shows the geographical location of the study areas the mean annual temperature is 18ﹾc the yearly mean rainfall of the study area is about 337 mm the mean altitude of shiraz is 1480 m above the sea level the primary source of drinking water is groundwater these wells are located in the vicinity of shiraz the aquifer of shiraz plain consists of calcareous and alluvial plain and the wells are in a depth of 150 m in alluvial texture up to 350 m in karstic texture 2 2 data collection and analysis a total of 350 175 chemical samples and 175 microbial samples groundwater samples from 35 wells were collected and analyzed for a period of 5 years from 2013 to 2017 all water samples were collected for chemical analysis into 1 litre capacity polythene containers water samples were maintained in an iced cooler during the ﬁeld work in laboratory the samples were kept in a refrigerator with temperature 2 4 c the microbial samples were transferred in an iced cooler to the laboratory in less than 2 h during this time all possible precautions in collection and handling sample steps were taken to minimize any contamination each sample was analyzed for 12 parameters of ca 2 mg 2 na hco3 cl so4 2 f ph total hardness th no3 tds and e coli by standard analytical methods and procedures federation and association 2005 shi et al 2018 na was determined using ﬂame photometer mg 2 ca 2 and hco3 1 was analyzed by the titrimetric method no3 cl total hardness so4 2 were analyzed by digital spectrophotometer model dr 5000 tds were determined by a conductivity meter meternmer 500 f was determined using spadns method and a dr 5000 spectrophotometer analyses were repeated until we reached 95 accuracy and 5 precision computing wqi includes three stages at first 12 parameters of ca 2 mg 2 na hco3 cl so4 2 f ph total hardness th tds and e coli were selected considering the relative importance of each parameter on groundwater quality for drinking purposes and also based on their perceived effects on primary health a weight wi rating 1 5 was assigned to each parameter the maximum weight i e 5 was given to such parameters as tds and nitrate since it is the most crucial index for groundwater quality evaluation in study area 4 to so4 2 th and ph 3 to cl 2 to ca 2 mg 2 na and 1 to hco3 due to its role in groundwater quality evaluation in the next step the relative weight wi was computed for each parameter by eq 1 1 w i w i i 1 n w i wi is the relative weight wi is the weight assigned to each parameter and n is the number of parameters jayalakshmi and velappan 2015 in the third stage quality rating scale qi of each parameter was assigned by dividing its amount of measured parameters in each sample by its respective standard value according to who guidelines and the result was multiplied by 100 2 q i c i s i 100 where qi is the relative quality scale for each parameter ci is the concentration of each parameter in the groundwater sample mg l and si is the who s guidelines for each parameter mg l finally to calculate the wqi we determined the sub index sii for each chemical parameter by eq 3 the sum of sii was calculated as the wqi value using eq 4 khosravi et al 2017 deepak and singh 2013 kalra et al 2012 3 s i i w i q i 4 w q i s i i sii is the sub index of its parameter qi is the relative quality of its parameter wi is the number of parameters and wqi is the water quality index the calculated wqi values are classified into six types excellent to unsuitable for drinking in this study the wqi from 2013 to 2017 was separately determined in each year in this study the sampling locations were imported through point layer into arcgis 10 3 software for preparation of zoning maps inverse distance weighting idw was used for the interpolation map of wqi 5 years on the plain of shiraz the existence or absence of sanitary protection in the radius around each well construction of a sewage collection network in the areas near the wells location of the wells relative to the slope and environmental factors and external surface use at a radius of 400 m were investigated using field visits and surveys as well as land use mapping 2 3 determining land use and their changes to determine the area and percentage of land usage and their differences in the radius of each well two land use maps one year before and one year after the study period 2012 and 2018 were based on the maps obtained from google earth software to do this we entered the coordinates of the wells previously provided by the gps into the arcview gis after the wells were located then the buffer function determined the radius 400 what around each well and it was added to google earth with the help of this function the land use map of 2012 was discontinued in the study area the area was cut in a radius of 400 m around each well a total of 4 land use groups in this space included agricultural coverage and green spaces industrial and road residential and urban areas as well as empty space in the radius around each well these calculations and operations were performed for all 35 studied wells in the first year 2012 also the same operation was repeated for the land use map of the final year 2018 as the second map to determine the percentage of each land use land cover and comparison with the previous land use map 2012 to determine variations of them for each well 2 4 multivariate statistical analysis the hydro chemical data total of 175 samples was statistically analyzed with hca and pca to identify the most weighted hca is a group of multivariate techniques which mainly classify the variables or cases into a cluster with high homogeneity level within the category and high heterogeneity level between the categories the spatial variability of groundwater sample points was determined by hca the results of hca help in interpreting the data and indicate patterns and provides the results in an understandable dendrogram kumar 2013 khelif and boudoukha 2018 for this reason first the mean parameters studied for each sample site were calculated over five years using the pearson correlation test the relationship between wqi and land use area was analyzed in four main groups as well as the depth of wells pca is a multivariate statistical technique used for data reduction with a view to specifying the sources of elements and their controlling factors it enables the locative distribution of the resulting factors to be determined the land use area was analyzed in four main groups as well as the depth of wells to determine the relationship between the existence and absence of sanitary protection construction and the lack of creation of a sewage collection network and the position of each well to the flow of groundwater with wqi t test was used for the calculation of mean and standard deviation of each of the two groups of wells two groups with options yes and no 3 results and discussion understanding groundwater quality is necessary due to its principal factors for potable suitability usage shabbir and ahmad 2015 the statistical analysis of chemicals and physical parameters of groundwater samples including minimum maximum and the mean values are reported in table 1 the ionic dominance pattern is in the order of ca 2 mg 2 na and hco3 so4 2 cl no3 for cations and anions respectively moreover ca 2and hco3 was shown in the high concentration among the cations and anions respectively in the groundwater of the study area the na 1 concentration in the groundwater varies between 12 and 160 mg l with a mean value of 49 7 mg l according to who standards 2011 who 2011 all groundwater samples were within the maximum allowable limit of 200 mg l for sodium in the study area the ca 2 and mg 2 concentrations were 34 to 5 to 114 6 and 8 to 172 32 respectively cationic concentrations and ratios can be used to understand reactive processes between rocks and water such as weathering and cationic exchange the maximum permissible limit of mg2 for drinking water is 150 mg l which results reveal that 94 3 of collected groundwater samples are within the portable range for drinking purposes who 2011 the higher contents of magnesium in water are due to gypsum and anhydrite dissolution in the groundwater khelif and boudoukha 2018 chloride generally considered as an index of water pollution and also higher concentration gives a salty taste to water and have a laxative effect moreover it derives mainly from the domestic wastage industrial wastes and municipal effluents in the present study area chloride concentration ranged from 7 to 156 mg l with a mean of 71 mg l the desirable limit of chloride in potable water is 200 mg l in who standards 2011 for drinking water the results of the present study determined that all groundwater samples were within the desirable limit for drinking water chloride generally considered as an index of water pollution and also higher concentration gives a salty taste to water and have a laxative effect moreover it derives mainly from the domestic wastage industrial wastes and municipal effluents adimalla et al 2018 fluoride in low dosage affects dental hygiene higher values of fluoride lead to skeletal fluorosis saleem et al 2016 fluoride concentration was observed from 0 4 to 0 72 mg l in different samples thus the fluoride values at 139 samples were found to be under the acceptable range specified in who standards 2011 for drinking water who 2011 no3 values ranging from 4 to 70 mg l with an average of 25 57 mg l 6 of samples had a higher nitrate concentration than who standard and these samples were obtained from two wells because of the lack of nitrate in most geologic formations no3 concentrations 5 mg l are generally indicative of water contamination by anthropogenic sources such as animal waste fertilizer and or effluent adimalla and qian 2019 total dissolved solids tds value ranged from 153 to 898 7 mg l with an average of 614 5 mg l water can be classified based on tds values into freshwater 1000 ppm slightly saline water 1000 3000 ppm moderately saline water 3000 10 000 ppm and highly saline water 10 000 35000 ppm adimalla and qian 2019 all the samples fell in the freshwater category a piper diagram was created using the analytical data obtained from the hydro chemical analysis of groundwater fig 2 it indicates that the groundwater is of the calcium bicarbonate ca2 mg2 hco3 type assessment of the water types by piper plot suggests that there is a clear indication of the contribution from the weathering in the hard rocks kumar et al 2013 the calcium bicarbonate water resulted mainly from the dissolution of limestone frisbee et al 2016 the dominance of ca 2 in the groundwater samples collected from the region with more slope suggested an inverse ion exchange process ravikumar and somashekar 2017 high hco3 values in groundwater samples are due to the dissolution of limestone in a karst aquifer since bicarbonate was significant in all the groundwater samples obtained water buffering capacity in the study areas was primarily maintained this high buffering capacity has hindered many changes of ph baghapour et al 2016 3 1 wqi determination and zoning the wqi summarizes a significant number of various parameters of groundwater quality in a general method into a single number and it is a helpful technique to assess and manage the groundwater resources damo and icka 2013 weight and relative weight of each parameter in who standards are shown in table 2 the classification of wqi for groundwater sample points is presented in table 3 if the wqi is less than 50 water has excellent quality water is characterized by an index between 50 and 100 water of adequate quality the index in the range of 100 200 indicates poor water quality and the index between 200 and 300 and more represents a very poor quality showing improper drinking water the results of this study showed that the quality index of drinking water in the study area was in the range of 38 63 166 1 of the total two wells had excellent quality 23 had a good quality index and 10 had low and poor quality the results are shown in fig 2 along with the study period 2013 2017 according to these maps the quality index of drinking water from the northwest to the northeast has increased the two wells 31 and 35 which have a good quality index are located in the northwestern part of shiraz plain the same results zoned are shown in fig 2 and also during the study period 2013 2017 according to these maps the quality index of drinking water from the northwest to the northeast has increased the wells no 31 and 35 which have a good quality index are located in the northwest of shiraz plain these wells have the most abundant free space within a radius of 400 m and at the same time they have less residential and urban usage than the other wells in this region wells no 32 34 have a weaker quality index these wells are located at the point of adjacent tissue binding to calcareous tissue near an urban area a survey of the piezometric level in the area indicated that water harvesting exceeds the water balance water level which has caused the groundwater to flow to the calcareous wells unlike the slope direction of the alluvial texture resulting in lower quality water entering the wells the results of a study by doza in bangladesh showed that the entry of sewage into aquifer and agricultural activities in the area around the wells was due to low groundwater quality bodrud doza et al 2016 according to the zoning map fig 3 wells located in the eastern and southeastern parts of the city center and the center have the highest quality index so that the average total wqi index in the wells of these areas was higher than 100 it seems that the proximity of the wells to urban and residential contexts and the high density of the residential area the movement of pollutants from the upper regions towards these wells has reduced the quality of drinking water in these areas wells no 20 and 21 in this area are located in a vineyard farm the results of field studies have shown that 5 10 tons of organic fertilizers per hectare are used annually to fertilize this field the value of the qualitative index of these two wells was 67 and 68 indicating that agricultural activities did not affect the quality of wells in the studied wells the interpolation map and spatial analysis of the sample points showed that the safest zone was groundwater from the northwest region these wells have the lowest values of wqi among all the wells studied in the five years 2013 2017 on the other hand it seems that discharge groundwater rate is increased widely leading to increase of contaminants and minerals into groundwater hence the groundwater quality was degraded 3 2 wqi value variation trend a comparison of the mean wqi in the 5 year period of 2013 2017 is shown in fig 4 in this graph the mean of wqi from a total of 35 wells in each year was analyzed then the mean was compared fluctuation trend of wqi quantities showed that in 2014 groundwater quality had relatively increased and it was constant in 2015 2016 which was probably due to wastewater collection network completion the wqi trend in 2017 was incremental since few wells are located in sedimentary tissue pollutant remanded in sedimentary layer for years therefore in spite of the construction of the wastewater collection network the quality was slightly increased also the wells with the highest values of wqi poor quality gradually increased this shows that the contaminant points of shiraz plain require serious control plan 3 3 multivariate statistical analysis the analytical results of pca were performed for the set of 35 wells and 11 variables the result of this analysis is shown as a tree diagram in fig 5 there are three distinct clusters at interval 5 from this dendrogram we can find the relationship between different wells the first group includes 8 wells the well numbers 20 29 35 the second one contains 11 wells well numbers 1 6 8 11 and 21 and the third group consists of 16 wells the well numbers 7 12 19 and 22 28 the results showed that the first group wells had the lowest values of anions and cations supplementary 1 wells with excellent wqi are in this category this group is located in the upstream of the urban area on the drak mountain foothills and it has the highest atmospheric charge and the least water interacts with the aquifer environment the result showed that the concentration of parameters studied in the second group was significantly more than the first group the majority of these wells are in the poor water quality category these wells are located close to residential areas and they are the margin of the urban region the third group wells have the highest values of tds total hardness and ions hydro chemistry of groundwater samples in the third group is likely to originate from rock weathering also it seems that the location of these wells in the contaminated groundwater passage path and an increase in the interaction of water with the environment have led to an increase in the concentration of the parameters pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relationship between physical and chemical parameters of water samples and the results are presented in the supplementary 2 factor analysis was performed using principal component analysis and varimax rotation of water components including th t d s no3 cl na so4 2 mg 2 ca 2 hco3 ph and f table 4 other variables were calculated by the sum of the variance of each observed variable in the constructed factor and an amount of eigen sum of squared loading factor equal to one was used as a criterion to enter an extra factor in the model finally based on factor analysis factor loadings equal to than 0 5 were considered acceptable based on the eigenvalues higher than one and scree plot supplementary 2 two independent factors were extracted which illustrate 77 44 of the total variance the pc1 was responsible for 65 23 of the total difference and it was best represented by total hard t d s no3 cl na so4 2 mg 2 ca 2and hco3 and a negative loading by ph this may represent the primary impacts of the precipitation dissolution processes of minerals such as gypsum dolomite calcite and silicates probably strong loadings of t d s no3 cl and na are due to pollutants transfer such as domestic wastewater from the surface and subsurface layers to groundwater resources pc2 explained 12 21 of the total variance and it was mostly participated by ph and f it seems that the fluoride ion f normally remains non reactive for groundwater with ph 7 0 because of its low solubility and remains absorbed in clay or exchangeable materials however in this study area due to alkaline ph once the ph of groundwater goes beyond 7 0 i e alkaline medium the hydroxyl group oh replace the exchangeable fluoride as kaolinite clay minerals t et al 2017 molekoa et al 2019 the results of table 5 show that wells located on groundwater flow have an average wqi of 105 28 11 85 even though the wells that were not in the direction of the gradient had a mean value of 76 2 18 7 it is indicated that when we are getting closer to drinking water in the city center and close to the drinking water in these areas the quality of drinking water will be reduced on the other hand these results indicate that the location and construction of wells in these areas were not done accurately also wells without sanitary protection had an average qualitative index of 109 74 10 65 and wells with sanitary protection had an average wqi of 78 2 18 7 these results showed that wells that had no sources of pollutants in a radius of 400 m mostly consisted of empty space which had a higher quality it seems that the construction of new wells in areas where construction and urban and agricultural development has not occurred is necessary given that wastewater produced in urban and residential areas was previously repelled through absorbing wells the produced wastewater at the closest distance had entered the aquifers and piezometric level of groundwater table 6 shows the correlation between drinking water quality index and land use and their changes based on this table the correlation coefficient between the quality index and depth of wells is 0 4 p 0 00 accordingly there was a linear and an inverse relationship between the depth of the wells and the water quality index the higher the depth the better the water quality it seems that with increasing depth of the wells the surface and subsurface contaminants can go down into the wells and down aquifers the results are consistent with other studies exner et al 2014 juntakut et al 2019 the highest correlation was obtained between the quality index with residential use 0 44 and secondly the vacant and unused lands 0 68 p 0 00 this is because the development of residential and urban areas has a direct role in the creation and transmission of contamination to the underlying layers of the soil and the reduction of groundwater quality the negative sign indicates that as the free space around the wells is higher the quality index is lower which means that the layers of soil above the aquifer are less affected hence the aquifer layer filtering function plays its part in maintaining the quality of the aquifer properly the results of the study showed that economic development had a significant and sudden impact on the reduction of groundwater quality in arid areas mainali and chang 2018 meanwhile user variations such as the use of residential and urban 0 49 and industrial 0 46 lands correlate more with quality degradation and this amount of unused land is 35 this finding shows that part of the vacant space around the wells has been declining and has become a reality for residential and industrial applications resulting in the rapid growth of pollution and their penetration into the underlying layers and since much of the aquifer texture is of calcareous type it has led to the faster entry of pollutants into deeper layers 3 4 correlation analysis and land use land cover change fig 6 shows the changes of the wqi in the studied period in 35 wells during the two years at the beginning and the end of the study duration indicating the effects of anthropogenic factors on the quality of drinking water of these resources and the change of the quality index as a result of this the qualitative index of wells has increased substantially the two wells 25 and 26 in this figure have suffered from a reduction in water quality but the quality deterioration in the well no 25 was more investigating the land use change showed that the highest industrial use in the area of these two wells occurred in 3 5 and 3 9 ha in well no 25 the residential use has increased by 3 6 ha indicating that the effects of increased industrial use combined with residential use together have led to significant changes in water quality the results of a study in nebraska usa showed that the most factors affecting the increased nitrate concentration were respectively depth of wells the presence of sand in the 1 5 m of the upper layer of the soil and hydraulic conductivity exner et al 2014 furthermore fig 7 shows the differences in each of the 4 land usage in the vicinity of the 35 wells in a graph based on this graph the most changes around the water wells are the use of vacant residential and urban spaces which means that empty space has a decreasing state and residential and urban usage has increased this indicates an increase in population density and also urban and residential development as a result of a reduction in vacant space in the radius around the water wells of the studied area this has led to an increase in the entry of contaminants and sewage into groundwater resulting in reduced quality 4 conclusion multivariate statistical methods pca hca and pearson correlation water quality index and arcview gis are applied to characterize the water quality which is a significant factor for controlling the groundwater quality in terms of drinking purposes the results showed that 5 7 of the samples samples taken from two wells had wqi in the excellent range while 65 7 sampling samples from 23 wells had a good quality index also 28 6 samples taken from 10 wells had poor quality according to the hydro chemical analysis results from the piper diagram showed that there were main hydro chemical facies in the shiraz plain area that was cahco3 two components are extracted using the pca pc1 which illustrates the greatest variance represents a mixed efficacy natural process such as precipitation dissolution processes and anthropogenic activity like urban land use water intrudes in the groundwater chemistry three different clusters are obtained through hca wells in the first group are located at drak mountain foothills and these wells less effect on the human activity and natural process the wells of the third group have the highest tds total hardness and ions values which seems to be due to the proximity of these wells to the wastewater contaminated in the urban area which originates from rock weathering wells with poor quality index generally had the highest density of urban and residential texture in their radius of 400 m furthermore wells that have sanitary protection and are constructed of a sewage collection network in the nearby urban context have a better quality than other wells pearson correlation analysis between land use change and wqi showed that variations of residential urban and industrial use had the highest correlation and this amount of unused lands is 35 the results of this study showed that the water quality index is worsening from northwest to southeast and from northeast to southeast therefore it can be concluded that the quality of groundwater located in the urban area is getting worse this decrease in water quality is mainly due to the lack of sanitary protection around each well rock weathering water rock interaction inappropriate location of wells changes in unused land for other purposes industrial and residential and also urban and residential development in wells declaration of competing interest
