moisture pulp to pit ratio on fresh and dry weight basis firmness kg and oil content on dry weight fruit weight g and the pulp to pit ratio on fresh basis were determined in subsamples of 0 5 kg of fruits the pulp to pit ratio was determined in fresh weight as the difference between fruit and pit weights fruits were dried at 105 c for 48 h to stable weight and moisture content and the pulp to pit ratio on dry weight basis were determined oil content was also estimated by a nmr analyser minispec nms100 bruker optik gmbh ettlingen germany according to del río and romero 1999 using 100 fruits fruit volume ml was measured from the volume of water displaced on immersion of 100 fruits in a graduated beaker with water firmness kg of table olives was measured in a subsample of 30 fruits using a fruit pressure tester called penetrometer model ft 327 3 27 lbs with a strut of 2 mm of diameter attached at the tip the strut was slowly introduced in each fruit assessing its firmness at harvest fruit size distribution fruits kg 1 was also calculated midday stem water potential swp was measured weekly in one leaf per tree with the pressure chamber model 1000 pms usa using the scholander et al 1965 technique from march 30th 2017 doy 89 until september 19th 2017 doy 262 dafb 157 and it was used to characterize the water status of trees for each treatment the leaves near the main trunk were covered in aluminum foil at least two hours before measurements were taken in order to describe the accumulative effect of the water deficit the water stress integral si was calculated from the ψ data myers 1988 during the period of water stress eq 1 eq 1 used a reference of 1 4 mpa the expression used was 1 si ψ 1 4 n where si is the stress integral ψ is the average midday stem water potential for any interval and n is the number of the days in the interval linear regression between stress integral and fruit moisture was determined 2 3 bruising measurements at harvest time a sample of about 2 5

a linear regression between stress integral si mpa day and fruit moisture was also calculated 3 results and discussion rdi treatments in this work were theoretically defined to reach certain levels of water stress as explained in material and methods section but the real pattern of midday stem water potential swp reached during the irrigation season is shown in fig 2 control treatment reached swp of 1 48 mpa before pit hardening and 2 16 mpa afterwards slightly lower than the theoretical defined water potential rdi 1 treatment consisted in a moderate water stress during pit hardening before pit hardening water potentials were similar to control 1 63 mpa and at the end of water stress period and before the beginning of regular recovery doy 241 minimum values of swp were lower than the control 3 08 mpa due to a problem in the irrigation system but they were completely recovered around 1 40 mpa at the end of the experiment doy 262 rdi 2 treatment consisted in a shorter period of water stress at pit hardening before the beginning of pit hardening minimum swp was near to control and the early recovery at late july doy 206 recuperated plant water status 2 44 mpa until the theorical level considered and no differences were found with control treatment 2 16 mpa rdi 3 treatment consisted in a severe water stress at pit hardening as in the rest of treatments no water stress was obtained before pit hardening 1 58 mpa and minimum swp during the period of stress and recovery were reached before the beginning of the regular recovery doy 241 showing severe water stress conditions 3 69 mpa at doy 220 in summary swp was similar in the four treatments before pit hardening above 1 5 mpa later swp in all treatments decreased reaching values slightly below 2 mpa until late july doy 206 when water status of the different irrigation treatments began to differentiate statistically significant differences for swp among irrigation treatments were observed at the beginning of the regular recovery period doy 241 especially between rdi 3 and the other treatments though at harvest all trees showed similar values to the control around 1 40 mpa fig 2 taking into account the water relations table 2 and fruit quality table 3 we can describe the effect of water stress in different phenological stages at the beginning of the studied period doy 89 163 before the beginning of pit hardening the stress integral ranged from 1 98 control to 4 22 mpa day rdi 3 without significant differences among treatments neither for minimum swp fig 2 fruit quality traits as weight volume moisture pulp to pit ratio on fresh and dry basis and oil content dry weight showed no differences between rdi treatments and control at this phenological stage table 3 statistical differences were found in firmness among treatments but later they disappeared until late august after early recovery and at the beginning of regular recovery doy 89 241 there were significant differences in the minimum swp and stress integral especially between rdi 3 and the other treatments fig 2 and table 2 rdi 1 induced a moderate water stress and since early recovery of rdi 2 treatment had already taken place doy 206 none of those treatments differed significantly from the control 2 16 mpa in fact rdi 2 early recovery of punctual water stress was the less stressed rdi treatment 48 29 mpa day without significant differences with respect to control and the regular recovery of moderate water stress treatment rdi 1 64 08 mpa day and severe water stress treatment rdi 3 89 06 mpa day was significantly the most stressed treatment for rdi 3 the regular recovery was slower thus the minimum swp in this phase reached the lowest value 3 69 mpa fig 2 and fruit weight volume moisture and pulp to pit ratio on fresh and dry basis decreased in this treatment with respect to the others treatments but only significantly with respect to rdi 2 table 3 in addition this treatment wasted less amount of water and was the only treatment that significantly reduced total water applied with respect to the control treatment at harvesting 105 vs 274 mm respectively table 2 no differences among treatments were found in flesh firmness nor oil content at this period table 3 at harvest doy 262 none of the rdi treatments had effect on fruit weight ranged between 4 01 and 4 60 g volume ranged between 4 00 and 4 71 ml pulp to pit ratio on dry basis ranged between 2 25 and 2 50 firmness ranged between 1 09 and 1 17 kg or oil content 38 90 and 41 66 table 3 because regular late august or early late july recovery reduced water stress of the fruits before harvest as girón et al 2015 observed however the pulp to pit ratio on fresh weight basis was significantly different between rdi 2 and rdi 3 7 70 and 6 37 respectively table 3 furthermore although rdi treatments didn t significantly modify mean fruit weight the number of fruit kg 1 was increased in rdi 3 fig 3 such effect was likely related with irrigation scheduling because the yield of the trees were very similar table 2 this was probably related to fruit moisture which linearly decreased with increasing stress integral r2 0 6381 fig 4 and the rdi 3 fruits showed the lowest values 62 98 with respect to the control fruits 67 09 table 3 despite this 93 75 of the fruits from rdi 3 were classified within commercial categories 340 360 fruits kg 1 according to the spanish trade standard regulation for table olives cv manzanilla de sevilla orden capdr 49066 2018 these results suggested that the recovery period could compensate severe water stress level as in rdi 1 such level of water stress is similar to the ones suggested by girón et al 2015 rdi treatments neither affected bruised fruits ranging between 24 28 for rdi 3 and 28 28 for rdi 2 nor bruise index ranged between 0 24 for rdi 3 and 0 28 for rdi 2 when fruits were hand harvested table 4 after an induced impact the percentage of bruised fruits and bruise index increased to 94 and 1 0 approximately without differences among rdi treatments and control when fruits were hand harvested all bruised fruits were classified as low damaged but when fruits were bruise induced the percentage of severe damage ranged between 4 51 for rdi 1 and 9 29 for rdi 2 without significant differences among rdi treatments in any case similar bruising values were observed by jiménez et al 2011 for manzanilla de sevilla fruits after an induced impact nevertheless external damaged area and bruise volume decreased significantly in the most water stressed fruits rdi 3 36 02 mm2 and 66 83 mm3 respectively compared to the early recovery treatment rdi 2 43 27 mm2 and 96 85 mm3 respectively that finally received the same applied water as the control table 2 these results are in agreement with casanova et al 2017 who studied the effect of rdi in the sensitive crop phase 1 2 mpa before pit hardening and withholding until 2 5 mpa four weeks before harvest without recovery with respect to the internal damage an evident discoloration through the mesocarp was observed in the bruised mesocarp sections the discoloration was surrounded by a darker halo and showed tissue ruptures inside without affecting the epidermis as previously described by jiménez et al 2016 fig 5 no significant differences were neither found in the internal damaged area values that ranged between 14 37 mm2 rdi 1 and 15 64 mm2 rdi 3 table 4 although qualitatively the discoloration in the most water stressed fruits rdi 3 was lower fig 5 rdi treatments had no significant effect on the cuticle and epidermis parameters during the fruit growing season from the beginning of pit hardening to harvest table 5 regarding cuticle at the beginning of pit hardening the thickness ranged between 7 73 μm rdi 2 and 8 93 μm control and cuticle area per cell ranged between 152 59 μm2 rdi 2 and 181 27 μm2 rdi 3 at late august regular recovery date rdi fruits showed however thicker cuticle and larger cuticle area per cell 12 11 μm and 292 95 μm2 for rdi 1 11 50 μm and 283 20 μm2 for rdi 2 11 87 μm and 293 29 μm2 for rdi 3 than the control 10 93 μm and 265 79 μm2 although not significant at harvest the most stressed fruits rdi 3 presented greater cuticle thickness 12 05 μm and cuticle area per cell 291 26 μm2 and control fruits showed the lowest values for the same traits 11 07 μm and 262 36 μm2 respectively even though the differences were again not significant table 5 and fig 6 concerning epidermal cell size no statistical differences were found at any date at harvest the rdi 2 fruits showed the largest tangential width 24 67 μm and area 353 19 μm2 followed by rdi 3 fruits 24 18 μm and 344 62 μm2 and control fruits the lowest 23 73 μm and 343 18 μm2 respectively instead control fruits presented the greater epidermal cell radial width 14 47 μm and regular recovery treatments rdi 1 and rdi 3 the lowest 14 23 and 14 25 μm respectively table 5 in spite of not having found significant differences for cuticle properties the significant lower bruise damage observed in the most stressed treatment rdi 3 both in the external area and volume of damaged fruit could be related to the higher values observed for cuticle thickness and cuticle area per cell in the fruits of this treatment fig 6 and table 5 it is known that manzanilla de sevilla is a bruise susceptible cultivar jiménez jiménez et al 2013 jiménez et al 2016 and fruits present a thinner cuticle compared to other table varieties like hojiblanca or manzanilla cacereña hammami and rapoport 2012 jiménez et al 2017 which are considered less susceptible to bruising in our trial the more stressed deficit irrigation treatment rdi 3 seems to cause an increase in the cuticle thickness as observed by other authors in some water stress conditions gómez del campo et al 2014 patumi et al 2002 although further research should be performed to confirm it 4 conclusions the rdi 3 strategy 1 2 mpa before the beginning of pit hardening and a severe water stress 3 5 mpa from the beginning of pit hardening until late august doy 241 dafb 136 after which the fruit was rehydrated up to harvest regular recovery was the most stressing treatment for the tree and the fruits and the less water consuming treatment rdi 3 produces fruits with average weight volume and oil content similar to the control the increase in the number of fruits per kg might be caused by the loss of fruit moisture in the rdi treatments as the stress integral increases but even so more than 90 of the fruits are classified within commercial categories furthermore this severe water stress treatment with late rehydration rdi 3 reduces the size of fruit bruises in comparison to early rehydration strategy this is a very interesting result since bruising incidence is one the main factors limiting table olive commercial quality acknowledgements this research was supported by spanish research agency aei of the ministry

moisture pulp to pit ratio on fresh and dry weight basis firmness kg and oil content on dry weight fruit weight g and the pulp to pit ratio on fresh basis were determined in subsamples of 0 5 kg of fruits the pulp to pit ratio was determined in fresh weight as the difference between fruit and pit weights fruits were dried at 105 c for 48 h to stable weight and moisture content and the pulp to pit ratio on dry weight basis were determined oil content was also estimated by a nmr analyser minispec nms100 bruker optik gmbh ettlingen germany according to del río and romero 1999 using 100 fruits fruit volume ml was measured from the volume of water displaced on immersion of 100 fruits in a graduated beaker with water firmness kg of table olives was measured in a subsample of 30 fruits using a fruit pressure tester called penetrometer model ft 327 3 27 lbs with a strut of 2 mm of diameter attached at the tip the strut was slowly introduced in each fruit assessing its firmness at harvest

covered in aluminum foil at least two hours before measurements were taken in order to describe the accumulative effect of the water deficit the water stress integral si was calculated from the ψ data myers 1988 during the period of water stress eq 1 eq 1 used a reference of 1 4 mpa the expression used was 1 si ψ 1 4 n where si is the stress integral ψ is the average midday stem water potential for

a linear regression between stress integral si mpa day and fruit moisture was also calculated 3 results and discussion rdi treatments in this work were theoretically defined to reach certain levels of water stress as explained in material and methods section but the real pattern of midday stem water potential swp reached during the irrigation season is shown in fig 2 control treatment reached swp of 1 48 mpa before pit hardening and 2 16 mpa afterwards slightly lower than the theoretical defined water potential rdi 1 treatment consisted in a moderate water stress during pit hardening before pit hardening water potentials were similar to control 1 63 mpa and at the end of water stress period and before the beginning of regular recovery doy 241 minimum values of swp were lower than the control 3 08 mpa due to a problem in the irrigation system but they were completely recovered around 1 40 mpa at the end of the experiment doy 262 rdi 2 treatment consisted in a shorter period of water stress at pit hardening before the beginning of pit hardening minimum swp was near to control and the early recovery at late july doy 206 recuperated plant water status 2 44 mpa until the theorical level considered and no differences were found with control treatment 2 16 mpa rdi 3 treatment consisted in a severe water stress at pit hardening as in the rest of treatments no water stress was obtained before pit hardening 1 58 mpa and minimum swp during the period of stress and recovery were reached before the beginning of the regular recovery doy 241 showing severe water stress conditions 3 69 mpa at doy 220 in summary swp was similar in the four treatments before pit hardening above 1 5 mpa later swp in all treatments decreased reaching values slightly below 2 mpa until late july doy 206 when water status of the different irrigation treatments began to differentiate statistically significant differences for swp among irrigation treatments were observed at the beginning of the regular recovery period doy 241 especially between rdi 3 and the other treatments though at harvest all trees showed similar values to the control around 1 40 mpa fig 2 taking into account the water relations table 2 and fruit quality table 3 we can describe the effect of water stress in different phenological stages at the beginning of the studied period doy 89 163 before the beginning of pit hardening the stress integral ranged from 1 98 control to 4 22 mpa day rdi 3 without significant differences among treatments neither for minimum swp fig 2 fruit quality traits as weight volume moisture pulp to pit ratio on fresh and dry basis and oil content dry weight showed no differences between rdi treatments and control at this phenological stage table 3 statistical differences were found in firmness among treatments but later they disappeared until late august after early recovery and at the beginning of regular recovery doy 89 241 there were significant differences in the minimum swp and stress integral especially between rdi 3 and the other treatments fig 2 and table 2 rdi 1 induced a moderate water stress and since early recovery of rdi 2 treatment had already taken place doy 206 none of those treatments differed significantly from the control 2 16 mpa in fact rdi 2 early recovery of punctual water stress was the less stressed rdi treatment 48 29 mpa day without significant differences with respect to control and the regular recovery of moderate water stress treatment rdi 1 64 08 mpa day and severe water stress treatment rdi 3 89 06 mpa day was significantly the most stressed treatment for rdi 3 the regular recovery was slower thus the minimum swp in this phase reached the lowest value 3 69 mpa fig 2 and fruit weight volume moisture and pulp to pit ratio on fresh and dry basis decreased in this treatment with respect to the others treatments but only significantly with respect to rdi 2 table 3 in addition this treatment wasted less amount of water and was the only treatment that significantly reduced total water applied with respect to the control treatment at harvesting 105 vs 274 mm respectively table 2 no differences among treatments were found in flesh firmness nor oil content at this period table 3 at harvest doy 262 none of the rdi treatments had effect on fruit weight ranged between 4 01 and 4 60 g volume ranged between 4 00 and 4 71 ml pulp to pit ratio on dry basis ranged between 2 25 and 2 50 firmness ranged between 1 09 and 1 17 kg or oil content 38 90 and 41 66 table 3 because regular late august or early late july recovery reduced water stress of the fruits before harvest as girón et al 2015 observed however the pulp to pit ratio on fresh weight basis was significantly different between rdi 2 and rdi 3 7 70 and 6 37 respectively table 3 furthermore although rdi treatments didn t significantly modify mean fruit weight the number of fruit kg 1 was increased in rdi 3 fig 3 such effect was likely related with irrigation scheduling because the yield of the trees were very similar table 2 this was probably related to fruit moisture which linearly decreased with increasing stress integral r2 0 6381 fig 4 and the rdi 3 fruits showed the lowest values 62 98 with respect to the control fruits 67 09 table 3 despite this 93 75 of the fruits from rdi 3 were classified within commercial categories 340 360 fruits kg 1 according to the spanish trade standard regulation for table olives cv manzanilla de sevilla orden capdr 49066 2018 these results suggested that the recovery period could compensate severe water stress level as in rdi 1 such level of water stress is similar to the ones suggested by girón et al 2015 rdi treatments neither affected bruised fruits ranging between 24 28 for rdi 3 and 28 28 for rdi 2 nor bruise index ranged between 0 24 for rdi 3 and 0 28 for rdi 2 when fruits were hand harvested table 4 after an induced impact the percentage of bruised fruits and bruise index increased to 94 and 1 0 approximately without differences among rdi treatments and control when fruits were hand harvested all bruised fruits were classified as low damaged but when fruits were bruise induced the percentage of severe damage ranged between 4 51 for rdi 1 and 9 29 for rdi 2 without significant differences among rdi treatments in any case similar bruising values were observed by jiménez et al 2011 for manzanilla de sevilla fruits after an induced impact nevertheless external damaged area and bruise volume decreased significantly in the most water stressed fruits rdi 3 36 02 mm2 and 66 83 mm3 respectively compared to the early recovery treatment rdi 2 43 27 mm2 and 96 85 mm3 respectively that finally received the same applied water as the control table 2 these results are in agreement with casanova et al 2017 who studied the effect of rdi in the sensitive crop phase 1 2 mpa before pit hardening and withholding until 2 5 mpa four weeks before harvest without recovery with respect to the internal damage an evident discoloration through the mesocarp was observed in the bruised mesocarp sections the discoloration was surrounded by a darker halo and showed tissue ruptures inside without affecting the epidermis as previously described by jiménez et al 2016 fig 5 no significant differences were neither found in the internal damaged area values that ranged between 14 37 mm2 rdi 1 and 15 64 mm2 rdi 3 table 4 although qualitatively the discoloration in the most water stressed fruits rdi 3 was lower fig 5 rdi treatments had no significant effect on the cuticle and epidermis parameters during the fruit growing season from the beginning of pit hardening to harvest table 5 regarding cuticle at the beginning of pit hardening the thickness ranged between 7 73 μm rdi 2 and 8 93 μm control and cuticle area per cell ranged between 152 59 μm2 rdi 2 and 181 27 μm2 rdi 3 at late august regular recovery date rdi fruits showed however thicker cuticle and larger cuticle area per cell 12 11 μm and 292 95 μm2 for rdi 1 11 50 μm and 283 20 μm2 for rdi 2 11 87 μm and 293 29 μm2 for rdi 3 than the control 10 93 μm and 265 79 μm2 although not significant at harvest the most stressed fruits rdi 3 presented greater cuticle thickness 12 05 μm and cuticle area per cell 291 26 μm2 and control fruits showed the lowest values for the same traits 11 07 μm and 262 36 μm2 respectively even though the differences were again not significant table 5 and fig 6 concerning epidermal cell size no statistical differences were found at any date at harvest the rdi 2 fruits showed the largest tangential width 24 67 μm and area 353 19 μm2 followed by rdi 3 fruits 24 18 μm and 344 62 μm2 and control fruits the lowest 23 73 μm and 343 18 μm2 respectively instead control fruits presented the greater epidermal cell radial width 14 47 μm and regular recovery treatments rdi 1 and rdi 3 the lowest 14 23 and 14 25 μm respectively table 5 in spite of not having found significant differences for cuticle properties the significant lower bruise damage observed in the most stressed treatment rdi 3 both in the external area and volume of damaged fruit could be related to the higher values observed for cuticle thickness and cuticle area per cell in the fruits of this treatment fig 6 and table 5 it is known that manzanilla de sevilla is a bruise susceptible cultivar jiménez jiménez et al 2013 jiménez et al 2016 and fruits present a thinner cuticle compared to other table varieties like hojiblanca or manzanilla cacereña hammami and rapoport 2012 jiménez et al 2017 which are considered less susceptible to bruising in our trial the more stressed deficit irrigation treatment rdi 3 seems to cause an increase in the cuticle thickness as observed by other authors in some water stress conditions gómez del campo et al 2014 patumi et al 2002 although further research should be performed to confirm it 4 conclusions the rdi 3 strategy 1 2 mpa before the beginning of pit hardening and a severe water stress 3 5 mpa from the beginning of pit hardening until late august doy 241 dafb 136 after which the fruit was rehydrated up to harvest regular recovery was the most stressing treatment for the tree and the fruits and the less water consuming treatment rdi 3 produces fruits with average weight volume and oil content similar to the control the increase in the number of fruits per kg might be caused by the loss of fruit moisture in the rdi treatments as the stress integral increases but even so more than 90 of the fruits are classified within commercial categories furthermore this severe water stress treatment with late rehydration rdi 3 reduces the size of fruit bruises in comparison to early rehydration strategy this is a very interesting result since bruising incidence is one the main factors limiting table olive commercial quality acknowledgements this research was supported by spanish research agency aei of the ministry

10966,a large portion of global sugarcane is produced under irrigation and this often occurs in areas where water supply is not abundant or reliable crop management decisions during limited water supply are complex and require information on the impacts of irrigation strategies on crops and profitability this paper describes the development of a computerized system to support farm level management of limited irrigation water for sugarcane production the system comprises a daily crop and water balance model an irrigation module and a gross margin calculator the model calculates crop yield and survival for the current y1 and the next season y2 for multiple fields on a farm for a given irrigation strategy and water supply climate scenario irrigation strategies that can be explored include 1 scheduling irrigation using growth phase specific soil water thresholds swt and 2 postponing replanting and or abandoning low potential fields farm gross margin is calculated from simulated yields and production costs at field level and takes into account re establishment costs when crops fail the system was applied in a case study for a hypothetical farm of 18 fields near komatipoort south africa four possible restricted water allocation scenarios were investigated namely a mildly and severely restricted allocation 50 and 25 of the full allocation over a 24 month and 12 month period results from the case study show that under most circumstances a swt of 60 of plant available soil water capacity applied during the germination and stalk growth phases produced the best outcome reducing swt to 30 during the tillering phase makes more water available for use on other fields resulting in higher crop survival under severe restrictions abandoning low potential fields under severe water restriction limited financial loss in y2 but reduced future productive capacity thereafter results suggest that the system produces realistic responses to irrigation applied and drought it has the potential to aid strategic decision making for irrigated sugarcane production during drought keywords sugarcane water balance irrigation gross margin crop model water allocation 1 introduction sugarcane is grown in more than a hundred countries around the world in 2016 global sugarcane production amounted to 1 890 million tons valued at us 92 billion harvested from 27 million ha at an average yield of 70 t ha fao 2018 the most important products from sugarcane are sugar an important source of food energy and renewable energy in the form of bio ethanol and electricity a large portion of global sugarcane is cultivated under irrigation in many countries water is a scarce resource and increasing and competing demands often lead to restricted allocations for agricultural production this is especially the case in southern africa and specifically in south africa where very low and erratic rainfall causes a strong demand for irrigation to stabilize crop yields concurrently surface water supplies for irrigation are limited and water allocation for irrigation is often restricted in times of drought it is estimated that 35 of sugarcane produced in south africa is irrigated singels et al 2015 a large portion of this is grown in the nkomazi catchment in the mpumalanga province rossler 2014 showed that the full water allocation for three of the four water sources in this region cannot meet the long term irrigation demand of sugarcane records show that since 2000 allocations were restricted below normal levels full allocation of 960 1300 mm annum depending on water source in 2003 04 2007 08 2011 rossler 2014 and in 2015 16 singels et al 2017 sugarcane growth was affected negatively by water deficit stress during these periods leading to yield losses at harvest singels et al 2017 efficient irrigated sugarcane production requires guidance on the optimal use of irrigation water when demand for water exceeds supply commercial sugarcane farms typically consist of several fields with varying agronomic conditions the variation could arise from differences in the crop status different varieties at different growth and ratoon stages soil properties and irrigation systems in south africa the milling season typically stretches from april to december and farmers are required to harvest and deliver cane to the mill throughout this period crops are therefore at various stages of development covering the full growth cycle of about 12 months in addition sugarcane is ratooned after harvest typically for seven or eight times before the field will be re planted after a short fallow period this implies that crops are also at various ratoon stages at a given point in time this variation may cause crops to respond differently to irrigation or the lack thereof the consensus from studies by ellis and lankford 1990 pene and edi 1999 robertson et al 1999 wiedenfeld 2000 and rossler 2014 confirmed in a review by carr and knox 2011 is that cane yield is most sensitive during the stalk elongation phase and less in the tillering and maturation phases numerous studies inman bamber and de jager 1988 robertson and donaldson 1998 singels and inman bamber 2002 inman bamber 2004 inman bamber and smith 2005 inman bamber et al 2008 2009 have also shown that water stress during the maturation phase i e the practice of drying off increases sucrose yields and has relatively little impact on cane yields crop responses to water stress which are growth stage and ratoon stage dependent will impact profitability in the short and longer term as drought effects could be carried over to subsequent seasons there is therefore scope to explore different strategies of 1 scheduling irrigation at a field level and of 2 spatially distributing the available water to the different fields when water supply is limited algorithms for optimizing the application of limited irrigation water for crop production have been developed rao et al 1988 used a simple water balance weekly time step and empirical yield model doorenbos et al 1979 with weather data to identify the optimal apportioning of limited water between the different growth phases within a growing season of a single crop that would maximize crop yield inman bamber et al 2005 used a sophisticated simulation model to explore different crop water status thresholds for triggering irrigations when supply was limited to find the level that would maximize sugarcane yield these two methods are not true optimization techniques they find the best option from numerous possibilities and they apply to a single crop at a time de paly and zell 2009 evaluated two types of evolutionary algorithms genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization in combination with a simple soil water balance and yield response model of doorenbos et al 1979 to find optimal daily irrigation schedules for a single hypothetical field of maize lopez et al 2017 included an automatic irrigation algorithm to the dssat crop modelling system and then used three heuristic optimization algorithms to optimize irrigation maximize single field maize and soybean yield for various water supply scenarios the irrigation algorithm schedules irrigation events according to growth phase specific soil water thresholds the mycanesim sugarcane simulation system singels and paraskevopoulos 2017 has a sophisticated automatic irrigation algorithm that schedules irrigation events according to user specified soil water thresholds that may vary over the growing season seasonal water supply as well as irrigation system constraints paraskevopoulos 2015 although these applications are able to optimize irrigation over the growing season they all rely on a given water supply for a single field optimization across multiple fields spatially and temporally is therefore not possible ng cheong and teeluck 2018 developed software to assist sugarcane farmers in deciding how to distribute and schedule irrigation water on multiple fields it uses a simple water balance model to calculate soil water status for the different fields priorities are assigned based on growth phase germination stalk growth tillering and maturity ratoon stage and system efficiency the tool is designed for operational decision making regarding the next irrigation cycle although the tool was evaluated for user friendliness and usefulness the quality of the advice has not been evaluated irrigation water is distributed assuming that prescribed priorities will optimize irrigation in terms of crop yield and survival drought irrigation strategy decisions are complex and are based primarily on expected profitability and sustainability of the farming enterprise which will depend on crop responses on multiple fields ideally reliable information is required on the impacts of a given strategy decision on crop survival and financial profit at farm and field level although the systems reviewed here do provide some assistance for managing irrigation with limited water supply they do not address these aspects adequately the optimization goal seems to be yield maximization for one field at a time and not maximization of farm production or profitability in addition some of these make use of simple single soil layer single crop evaporation coefficient and untested soil water balance models and generic empirical yield prediction models with low temporal resolution e g growth phase total evapotranspiration deficit reliability of outputs depends on how realistic water balance and crop growth simulations are the aim of this work was to develop software to support farm level management of limited irrigation water for sugarcane production the software should support strategic planning to provide general guidance for the medium term 3 21 months rather than advice for short term operational management the specific objectives were to 1 develop a system for evaluating the impacts of a chosen irrigation strategy on future crop growth and yield and profitability at field and farm level for an assumed weather and water allocation scenario and 2 to evaluate the system for credibility and usefulness using south african case studies in summer rainfall areas in south africa the water management year runs from april to march government storage dams normally get filled from december to march the main rainfall period by march prevailing dam levels will largely dictate how water will be allocated for the rest of the water year assuming long term mean demand and supply for the next 12 months water allocations are updated on a weekly or monthly basis as the season progresses when dam levels drop below certain thresholds the water allocation for the next 12 months would be restricted there is therefore a need for south african sugarcane farmers and water managers to better understand the impact of the likely water allocation scenario on sugarcane production when this is announced by water managers a tool was needed to help managers work out a strategy for distributing available water on farms for the current and the following season and to understand the short and medium term financial impacts the impact of future rainfall also needed to be taken into account long lead forecasts of oceanic and atmospheric conditions such as el nino southern oscillation iri 2019 bom 2019 everingham et al 2008 that influence rainfall are becoming more reliable and could be used when exploring irrigation strategy impacts 2 system description 2 1 introduction the system was designed and built in collaboration with sugarcane farmers extension specialists and cane grower economists of the pongola and mpumalanga sugarcane producing areas in south africa sugarcane crops are typically harvested at 11 14 months between the months of april and december the industry required a system that could provide guidance on irrigation strategy for the medium term remainder of current season and possibly the following season after the water allocation regime outlook for the rest of the water year april to may is made known normally early april at the end of rainy season the idea is that the system be applied during periods of current and future expected limited water supply it can first be applied at the start of the milling season and then on occasions thereafter when the water allocation or rainfall outlook changes the system should enable evaluation of different irrigation strategies on crop status and economics and field and farm level strategies should include reducing irrigation frequencies and or amounts during specific growth phases and prioritizing fields for irrigation according to current and future yield potential 2 2 overview of components and data flow the system simulates crop growth for multiple fields under a given water allocation and weather scenario distributes available irrigation water across competing fields and schedules irrigation applications following a user defined irrigation strategy the system comprises a crop and water balance simulation model an irrigation module and a gross margin calculator coded in microsoft excel using vba a process based daily crop growth and water balance simulation model calculates the impact of specified irrigation strategies on crop yield and survival for the current an next season y1 and y2 under assumed future water supply allocation and climate scenarios available irrigation water is applied according to the specified irrigation strategy for each field and following the specified survival priority for each field irrigation strategies that can be explored include 1 scheduling rules based on growth phase specific soil water thresholds swt 2 adjusting drying off periods and 3 postponing replanting and or abandoning low potential fields farm level gross margins are then calculated for y1 and y2 from simulated yields and production costs at field level taking into account the feasibility of harvesting and the cost associated with replanting fields that failed the user specifies the nearest weather station and chooses one of three rainfall categories below near and above normal expected for the remainder of the current season the system compiles weather data for simulations using historic data that correspond to the chosen category for the period from april to the current date recently recorded data are used for the future period a past weather data sequence is selected to represent the future the selected sequence will fall in the same rainfall category for the relevant period in y1 than that chosen by the user other user inputs include the past and expected future weekly water allocation for the farm field inputs such as size crop cycle dates cultivar ratoon stage soil type irrigation system type the irrigation strategy for each field and financial information required for gross margin calculations outputs from the simulation include irrigation applied crop status alive failed yield and gross margin for each field for y1 and y2 as well as for the farm as a whole system components and data flow are illustrated in fig 1 and data organization is explained in table 1 2 3 model a balanced modelling approach in terms of complexity is required to achieve adequate prediction accuracy and operational practicality rapid simulation of multiple fields and scenarios soil water balance simulation should have a daily time step to capture effects of large rainfall events it should have a multi layered soil representation to capture rooting distribution effects on crop water status and it should distinguish between evaporation from the soil in order to account for different wetting patterns and frequencies and transpiration a strong driver of crop yield accuracy is also needed in simulating the formation and senescence of the crop canopy which determines radiation interception transpiration and photosynthesis the strong relationship between yield formation and transpiration found for sugarcane provides a convenient way of calculating cane yield while temperature and water status impacts on sucrose accumulation must be simulated to capture seasonal and irrigation effects on sucrose yields crop and canopy development and water balance aspects of the model use here are based on the simulation approach used in the canesim model singels and paraskevopoulos 2017 a precursor version of the canesim model has been evaluated for simulation of the water balance and unstressed canopy development singels et al 1998 singels and donaldson 2000 and these aspects are considered a solid basis to work from three phenological phases are simulated namely 1 germination phase during which buds sprout and emerge as primary shoots 2 the tillering phase during which the canopy and roots of the crop develop rapidly and 3 the stalk growth phase when the canopy is relatively full and the roots have colonized the soil profile the progression of these phases depends on thermal time and is calculated as in canesim a fourth phase is simulated during which irrigation is withheld to increase the sucrose content in cane stalks named the drying off phase see robertson and donaldson 1998 this phase commences a user specified number of days before the planned harvest date green canopy cover fi defined as the fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation by green leaves is simulated as in canesim based on work by smit and singels 2006 but with three adjustments firstly no canopy expansion takes place when profile available soil water content is below 30 of capacity secondly the canopy expansion after water stress is relieved occurs at twice the rate of the reduction in green canopy during water stress based on findings by smit and singels 2006 this is to reflect the observed ability of sugarcane crops to accelerate leaf growth during recovery from water stress rossler 2014 thirdly green canopy decline senescence during water stress is allowed to continue past the lower limit set in canesim if water stress conditions persist and the crop is considered to have failed no prospect of recovery to a viable crop stand when the green canopy fraction declines below a value of 0 1 the following equations were used to simulate canopy senescence and recovery 1 fi fio 1 fwavg 2 fwavg σ fw fwperiod 3 fw 1 when gstress 0 5 and fw 2 when gstress 5 where fio is the potential unstressed canopy cover see singels and donaldson 2000 fwavg is the reduction in fractional canopy cover due to the net cumulative water stress experienced by the crop calculated by counting the number of days with water stress fw 1 and number of days with no water stress fw 2 the value of fw is derived from the water stress index for expansive growth gstress and is assigned a value of 1 for days that the crop experiences water stress gstress 0 5 and a value of 2 when the crop is unstressed and in recovery gstress 0 5 fwperiod is defined as the number of consecutive days with water stress required to reduce a full green canopy to zero a value of 100 d assumed based loosely on smit and singels 2006 a cascading water balance is maintained for a layered soil profile the number of soil layers depends on the chosen maximum effective rooting depth 30 60 100 140 cm layer thickness are 30 30 40 and 40 cm water flows and root development are calculated as in canesim it was decided to use a functional approach to calculating cane and sucrose yield focussing on water relations rather than the sophisticated biomass accumulation and partitioning alorithms available in existing crop simulation models such as dssat canegro jones and singels 2018 apsim sugar keating et al 1999 and canesim singels and paraskevopoulos 2017 it was important to simulate yield response to water accurately and to also keep it relatively simple to minimize computing time the cane yield calculation was therefore based on the algorithm used by singels et al 1999 which was derived from simulations from the canegro model a well tested model it was also important that yield calculations also account for soil cultivar and crop health differences between fields as these factors will cause differential yield responses to irrigation the following equations were used to calculated cane yield cy in t ha 4 cy te transcum transb 5 te tei δ transcum transb where te is the average transpiration efficiency at harvest defined as the cane yield produced per unit of transpiration during the stalk growth phase in t ha mm transcum is the cumulative transpiration at harvest since the start of the crop in mm and transb is the total transpiration from the crop emergence to the start of stalk growth in mm it has been shown that te declines as the crop matures park et al 2005 and van heerden et al 2010 and hence te was calculated as function of the initial te during early stalk growth tei and cumulative transpiration since the start of stalk growth see fig 2 parameter δ is the average decline in te per unit transpiration during the stalk growth phase in t ha mm tei is calculated as a function of maximum tei for a given field as determined by its yield potential category teo as well as ratoon stage ratoon 6 tei teo 1 ρ ratoon 1 ratoon crops 7 tei 95 teo plant crops parameter ρ is the fractional yield decline for each successive ratoon after the first ratoon a fractional decline rate of 0 037 ratoon was assumed based on the finding by ramburan et al 2013 that average yield decline rate equalled about 9 t ha ratoon for irrigated cane sucrose yield sy in t ha is the product of sucrose content sc and cane yield cy in t ha sc is calculated as non linear function of cy and a sucrose accumulation index rviavg 8 sc scmax 1 exp γ cy β 1 σ rviavg 0 6 0 75 0 6 where scmax is defined as the cultivar specific sucrose content of a 12 month crop at a reference maturity condition rviavg 0 6 γ is an empirical parameter determining the shape of the sc vs cy curve β is the cy where a sc of half the maximum value is reached and σ is the relative increase in sc when rviavg increases from 0 6 to 0 75 eq 8 is illustrated in fig 3 rviavg represents the maturity condition of the crop as impacted by mild water stress and cool temperatures over the most recent 21 days and is calculated as the average daily rvi over this period 9 rvi ft fw 2 where 10 ft 1 1 exp 0 32 tmean 25 from singels and bezuidenhout 2002 and 11 fw 1 swsi 0 5 from singels and bezuidenhout 2002 where swsi is the soil water satisfaction index which is determined by the availability of soil water in relation to the demand value of 1 for ample water zero for no water eq 8 attempts to capture the effect of thermal maturity of the crop and recent temperature and water status conditions on the sucrose accumulation process table 2 simulated yields were compared to yields measured for cultivar nco376 in 26 diverse experiments conducted in south africa that included water stressed and well water scenarios singels and bezuidenhout 2002 simulation accuracy of the new model was satisfactory and as good as the standard canesim model singels and paraskevopoulos 2017 for predicting cane yield r2 0 88 root mean square error rmse 16 t ha n 137 sucrose yields were not as accurate r2 0 88 rmse 4 1 t ha n 135 compared to r2 0 88 rmse 3 9 t ha for the standard canesim model overall the model was considered sufficiently reliable for predicting crop response to irrigation weather and soil factors to be included in the software package 2 4 irrigation module the irrigation module evaluates current simulated soil water content and crop status growth phase and crop vigour for a given field in the context of the irrigation strategy specified for that field as well the remaining water availability for each week to schedule an irrigation event for the given field the algorithm logic is illustrated in fig 4 an irrigation strategy consists of four basic elements field level restriction the first option is to apply or not apply the restricted water allocation during the drought period period with restricted farm water allocation for the given field named the pro rata option when the pro rata option is chosen it will restrict cumulative irrigation applied since the start of the drought from exceeding the cumulative water allocation at that point in time the latter is calculated as the product of the annual water allocation for the drought period expressed as a fraction of the normal unrestricted allocation and the long term mean cumulative irrigation demand since the start of the drought period see paraskevopoulos 2015 for details generally when the pro rata option is chosen limited water will be used to irrigated more fields compared to when the option is not chosen field specific irrigation scheduling triggers irrigations are scheduled assuming adequate water supply using user specified soil water thresholds swt defined for each of the germination g tillering t and stalk growth s phases irrigations can be scheduled when available soil water content reaches the specified threshold typically 60 30 or 20 of capacity irrigations are withheld during the maturation drying off phase the start and end of the maturation phase is specified by the user and the duration can thus be varied in order to manipulate water distribution between fields survival priority all fields on the farm need to be assigned a priority ranking which will determine the order in which fields will queue for water in a given week normally high potential fields with efficient irrigation systems will be assigned higher priorities compared to low potential fields with less efficient irrigation systems abandonment specifies whether a given field should be abandoned that is not receive any irrigation or other inputs after the harvest of the previous crop this may be a feasible option for fields that are likely to fail or make a financial loss options also exist for varying irrigation amounts and or cycle periods minimum duration between consecutive irrigations in an attempt to alter water distribution across different fields on the farm 2 5 gross margin module the gross margin gm for each field for the current y1 and the next season y2 is calculated by subtracting the crop establishment costs cbase irrigation costs cirr harvest costs char and transport costs ctrans from the income derived from delivered cane costs and income vary depending on the status of the crop and how it was treated fig 5 when harvesting char in r ha plus transport ctrans in r ha costs exceeds potential income or when cane yield is less than 35 t ha then harvesting will not take place the gm is then taken as the negative sum of cirr and cbase and the cost of slashing back the living crop eq 13 the cost of slashing back is taken as the product of cane yield cy in t ha and the unit cost of cutting cane ccut in r t when the crop is dead the gross margin is taken as the negative sum of cirr and cbase only eq 14 12 gm income cbase cirr char ctrans when income char

as the difference in cost between establishment of a plant and ratoon crop divided in eight equal instalments over the length of the ratoon cycle when the crop fails the instalment is ramped up in proportion to the relative number of ratoon crops that were lost eq 22 22 crest cestp cestr 1 rat 8 for crop failure where rat refers the ratoon crop number where 0 is the plant crop gm calculations

average gross margin for each season is calculated by summing cane production t that was delivered to the mill and dividing it by the area of fields that was harvested for the given season 3 case studies 3 1 farm set up the hypothetical farm consisted of 18 fields of 1 ha each near komatipoort mpumalanga sixteen of these fields had cane growing on them with ratoon stages varying from a plant crop through to ratoon stage 7 crops were harvested and started on the 15th of each month of the milling season april to december for the base case two fields were fallowed in year 1 and got planted in year 2 while two fields with ratoon stage 7 in year 1 were fallowed in year 2 fields had identical soils with available water capacity of 100 mm overhead irrigation with a normal application of 35 mm and a minimum cycle period of 5 days were assumed daily weather data from the ten bosch weather station near komatipoort 25 33 s 31 57 e 170 masl for the period april 2014 to december 2016 were used as weather input the current date was taken as 1 october 2014 and the farmer learnt that given current water supply levels there was a strong probability that water restrictions will be imposed from january 2015 if dam inflows remain below normal water supply may be restricted for 12 months or longer depending on when good rainfall in the catchment will restore dam levels to the required thresholds in real world applications the system will select a past weather data sequence that most closely matches expected future weather as indicated by long term rainfall forecasts for the hypothetical case here a perfect forecast was assumed weather data for 2014 15 16 were used for simulations farm set up and time lines of crop growing periods harvesting periods and water restrictions are illustrated in fig 6 3 2 water allocations four restricted water allocation scenarios were investigated namely a mildly and severely restricted allocation 600 and 300 mm annum respectively applied over a long january 2015 to december 2016 and short january 2016 to december 2016 period the full non restricted allocation for this area is 1300 mm annum it should be noted that for this case study the allocation applied to area under cane 16 ha and not total cultivated area 18 ha the annual allocation alloc in mm was distributed between the 52 weeks of the water year april to may based on ratio of the long term mean estimated irrigation demand for a given week irrdemw in mm to the long term mean annual irrigation demand irrdem in mm 23 allocw irrdemw irrdem alloc where allocw is the weekly allocation irrdemw was taken as difference between long term mean weekly reference sugarcane evapotranspiration ecrefw as defined by mcglinchey and inman bamber 1996 and 70 of long term mean weekly rainfall rw only positive values for each week of the year averaged over the period 2001 2016 irrdemw 1 16 σ ecrefw 1 16 σ 0 7 rw and ecrefw 0 7 rw 24 monthly rainfall water allocation and long term mean irrigation demand for selected scenarios are shown in fig 7 3 3 irrigation strategies preliminary runs showed that the pro rata option produced the best outcomes for restricted water allocation scenarios because it distributed the water across fields in a better way swt values of 60 30 and 20 of plant available soil water capacity were used for the tillering t and stalk growth s phases preliminary runs indicated that using swt of less than 60 in the germination g phase were irrational as this led to underutilization of available water and excessive crop death the standard drying off period varied from 28 days to 50 days depending on harvest month pers comm f c olivier 2017 sasri mount edgecombe an extended drying off period for periods d2 with restricted water supply was also investigated by bringing forward the start of the drying off period by one week fields were assigned priorities for survival according to the ratoon class with plant crop fields having the highest priority and 7th ratoon fields the lowest priority field management strategies consisted of 1 not replanting the two fields that were due for replanting in y2 and 2 abandoning low potential fields or fields that are due to fail irrigation strategies were therefore defined in terms of number of fields to be abandoned a swts used to trigger irrigations in the germination g tillering t and stalk growth s phases and the duration of the drying period d1 normal d2 extended for example the strategy code a5 g60 t30 s60 d1 refers to a strategy where five fields were abandoned swt of 60 30 and 60 were used for the germination tillering and stalk growth phases respectively and crops underwent the standard drying off period 4 results results for the baseline irrigation strategy a0 g60 t60 s60 d1 under the long and severe water restriction scenario are shown in fig 8 water restrictions started in january 2015 and fields with lower priorities fields 8 16 got little or no water from january to april 2015 when harvesting commenced in april 2015 this allowed the saving of water on young ratooning fields fields 1 7 which could be applied on maturing crops fields 9 16 this enabled the survival of all fields in 2015 although yields were depressed on some of the fields to the point where a financial loss were made fields 13 16 from october 2015 to october 2016 water allocation was only adequate to irrigated fields 1 11 and two replanted fields field 17 and 18 with the result that three fields failed field 12 14 yields and gms for surviving fields were mostly lower in 2016 than in 2015 due to the longer period of restricted water supply farm average gm was also much lower the results from this simulation suggest possible adjustments to the irrigation strategy could be explored to mitigate negative impacts these include 1 not planting in y2 in an attempt to save some of the older ratoons 2 abandoning fields that were due to die to save irrigation water and costs 3 using a lower swt for selected phases to see whether available water could be used on more fields without affecting farm profitability and 4 extending the drying off period to use available water on more fields without affecting farm profitability the next section deals with exploring different irrigation strategies for the different water allocation scenarios simulation results are summarized in table 4 gross margin results for these are shown fig 9 the main findings emerging from these are long mild water restriction 24mo x600 mm annum not planting in y2 increased y2 gm but also led to crop failure in one additional field compared to the base line strategy a0 g60 t60 s60 d1 y2 gm was increased further by abandoning two additional low potential fields using swt g60 t30 s60 caused one more field to fail and reducing y2 gm marginally compared to the baseline strategy an extended drying off period had little effect and reduced y2 gm slightly compared to the corresponding standard drying off strategies long severe water restriction 24mo x300 mm annum a similar response to abandoning fields was achieved for the 300 mm water allocation increasing y2 gm but causing a drop in projected y3 gm due to fewer fields having viable crops using swt g60 t30 s60 caused crops on two more fields to fail compared to the baseline strategy while gm in y1 and y2 were similar to that of the baseline strategies using swt g60 t30 s30 performed worse than the baseline strategies in terms of gm and crop survival and was therefore not a good option to take short mild restriction 12mo x600 mm annum using swt g60 t30 s60 produced similar results to the baseline strategy not planting in y2 increased gm extending the drying off period in y2 saved one additional field compared to the baseline strategy using swt g60 t30 s30 succeeded in saving all fields including newly planted fields in y2 with only a small reduction in y2 gm compared to the baseline this suggest that deficit irrigation applied throughout the growing period could be a feasible option when the restrictions are not that severe and for a relatively short period short severe restriction 12mo x300 mm annum using swt g60 s30 t60 performed similarly or slightly worse than the baseline strategy extending the drying off period succeeded in saving one additional field using swt g60 t30 s30 also saved one additional field compared to corresponding baseline strategies overall using a swt g60 t20 s20 caused increased crop failure and large yield and gm reductions for all water allocation scenarios compared to the baseline strategies 5 concluding discussion a system was developed for assessing sugarcane farm irrigation strategies during drought periods when current and future water supply are expected to be insufficient it is designed to be applied on multiple fields with a shared water allocation to explore best ways of distributing the available supply spatially and temporally over two seasons previous work reported in the literature dealt with single fields and seasons only and spatial optimization has not been addressed sophisticated field and growth phase specific irrigation scheduling and field prioritization rules can be iteratively evaluated for assumed likely future weather and water supply scenarios as suggested by long term forecasts irrigation strategies can be re evaluated when new water supply and climate information becomes available the information generated by the system serves as a guide to support strategic irrigation and other crop management decisions during prolonged drought periods some features can be considered advancements on what have been used in limited irrigation management support systems reported in the literature the crop growth and water balance model is relatively sophisticated with high temporal resolution it makes use of a daily time step as opposed to weekly or growth phase time steps multi layer as opposed to single soil water balance with separation as opposed to combined simulation of soil evaporation e and transpiration t these features are important for realistic simulation of water balance as affected by large rainfall events different soil wetting patterns caused by different irrigation systems and rooting distribution with depth simulation of crop canopy responds dynamically to crop water status in addition to temperature and row spacing cane yield is driven by t and not et during the stalk growth phase and was shown to be accurate while sucrose yield is driven by crop water status and temperature these aspects enables more realistic simulations of crop response to water than simpler empirical models that have been used for sugarcane irrigation optimization some aspects of the program need further testing and possible refinement these include the simulation of canopy senescence and crop failure due to prolonged water deficit and the simulation of sucrose content management decision need to be based on financial information the system developed here combines biophysical and financial information through the calculation of gross margins these account for crop establishment costs and focus on fixed and variable irrigation costs as well as harvesting and transport costs estimated yields are used to determine feasibility of harvesting the cost of re establishing failed crops are calculated based on the ratoon stage of the failed crop the hypothetical case studies presented here suggest that the program produced realistic responses to irrigation applied and drought it has enough flexibility to accommodate site specific conditions and preferences typically the program will be run when a drought is looming or irrigation water supply is under threat the program will be set up to simulate the completion of the current season y1 as well as the next season y2 by assuming the most likely rainfall and water supply scenario based on long term forecasts the program can be used to provide broad guidelines for minimising the short and medium term impacts of protracted limited water supply on irrigated sugarcane production it can also be used to estimate impacts of a given water supply scenario on farm production and profitability it has the potential to be used for optimizing water distribution between farms as well as between regions by setting up and simulating virtual but representative cropping scenarios it also has the potential for supporting strategic agronomic decisions such as optimizing field deployment of cultivars and irrigation systems optimizing harvesting and planting schedules and assessing economic consequences of applying different harvesting and irrigation systems potential users include managers of large sugarcane farms and regional water use managers the latter can set up representative simulations to represent important agro climatic zones in a given water use district to explore impacts of spatial and temporal variation in water allocations over large areas work is underway to develop an algorithm to automate the iterative formulation of irrigation strategies for a given set of condition and subsequent evaluation of their impacts on crop status and profitability a simple queueing of fields for weekly water could also be upgraded to evaluate the impact of weekly distribution and refine it if needed but this will require a new simulation approach using object oriented programming acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge valuable inputs from sugarcane farmers sasri extension specialists and s a canegrowers

10966,a large portion of global sugarcane is produced under irrigation and this often occurs in areas where water supply is not abundant or reliable crop management decisions during limited water supply are complex and require information on the impacts of irrigation strategies on crops and profitability this paper describes the development of a computerized system to support farm level management of limited irrigation water for sugarcane production the system comprises a daily crop and water balance model an irrigation module and a gross margin calculator the model calculates crop yield and survival for the current y1 and the next season y2 for multiple fields on a farm for a given irrigation strategy and water supply climate scenario irrigation strategies that can be explored include 1 scheduling irrigation using growth phase specific soil water thresholds swt and 2 postponing replanting and or abandoning low potential fields farm gross margin is calculated from simulated yields and production costs at field level and takes into account re establishment costs when crops fail the system was applied in a case study for a hypothetical farm of 18 fields near komatipoort south africa four possible restricted water allocation scenarios were investigated namely a mildly and severely restricted allocation 50 and 25 of the full allocation over a 24 month and 12 month period results from the case study show that under most circumstances a swt of 60 of plant available soil water capacity applied during the germination and stalk growth phases produced the best outcome reducing swt to 30 during the tillering phase makes more water available for use on other fields resulting in higher crop survival under severe restrictions abandoning low potential fields under severe water restriction limited financial loss in y2 but reduced future productive capacity thereafter results suggest that the system produces realistic responses to irrigation applied and drought it has the potential to aid strategic decision making for irrigated sugarcane production during drought keywords sugarcane water balance irrigation gross margin crop model water allocation 1 introduction sugarcane is grown in more than a hundred countries around the world in 2016 global sugarcane production amounted to 1 890 million tons valued at us 92 billion harvested from 27 million ha at an average yield of 70 t ha fao 2018 the most important products from sugarcane are sugar an important source of food energy and renewable energy in the form of bio ethanol and electricity a large portion of global sugarcane is cultivated under irrigation in many countries water is a scarce resource and increasing and competing demands often lead to restricted allocations for agricultural production this is especially the case in southern africa and specifically in south africa where very low and erratic rainfall causes a strong demand for irrigation to stabilize crop yields concurrently surface water supplies for irrigation are limited and water allocation for irrigation is often restricted in times of drought it is estimated that 35 of sugarcane produced in south africa is irrigated singels et al 2015 a large portion of this is grown in the nkomazi catchment in the mpumalanga province rossler 2014 showed that the full water allocation for three of the four water sources in this region cannot meet the long term irrigation demand of sugarcane records show that since 2000 allocations were restricted below normal levels full allocation of 960 1300 mm annum depending on water source in 2003 04 2007 08 2011 rossler 2014 and in 2015 16 singels et al 2017 sugarcane growth was affected negatively by water deficit stress during these periods leading to yield losses at harvest singels et al 2017 efficient irrigated sugarcane production requires guidance on the optimal use of irrigation water when demand for water exceeds supply commercial sugarcane farms typically consist of several fields with varying agronomic conditions the variation could arise from differences in the crop status different varieties at different growth and ratoon stages soil properties and irrigation systems in south africa the milling season typically stretches from april to december and farmers are required to harvest and deliver cane to the mill throughout this period crops are therefore at various stages of development covering the full growth cycle of about 12 months in addition sugarcane is ratooned after harvest typically for seven or eight times before the field will be re planted after a short fallow period this implies that crops are also at various ratoon stages at a given point in time this variation may cause crops to respond differently to irrigation or the lack thereof the consensus from studies by ellis and lankford 1990 pene and edi 1999 robertson et al 1999 wiedenfeld 2000 and rossler 2014 confirmed in a review by carr and knox 2011 is that cane yield is most sensitive during the stalk elongation phase and less in the tillering and maturation phases numerous studies inman bamber and de jager 1988 robertson and donaldson 1998 singels and inman bamber 2002 inman bamber 2004 inman bamber and smith 2005 inman bamber et al 2008 2009 have also shown that water stress during the maturation phase i e the practice of drying off increases sucrose yields and has relatively little impact on cane yields crop responses to water stress which are growth stage and ratoon stage dependent will impact profitability in the short and longer term as drought effects could be carried over to subsequent seasons there is therefore scope to explore different strategies of 1 scheduling irrigation at a field level and of 2 spatially distributing the available water to the different fields when water supply is limited algorithms for optimizing the application of limited irrigation water for crop production have been developed rao et al 1988 used a simple water balance weekly time step and empirical yield model doorenbos et al 1979 with weather data to identify the optimal apportioning of limited water between the different growth phases within a growing season of a single crop that would maximize crop yield inman bamber et al 2005 used a sophisticated simulation model to explore different crop water status thresholds for triggering irrigations when supply was limited to find the level that would maximize sugarcane yield these two methods are not true optimization techniques they find the best option from numerous possibilities and they apply to a single crop at a time de paly and zell 2009 evaluated two types of evolutionary algorithms genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization in combination with a simple soil water balance and yield response model of doorenbos et al 1979 to find optimal daily irrigation schedules for a single hypothetical field of maize lopez et al 2017 included an automatic irrigation algorithm to the dssat crop modelling system and then used three heuristic optimization algorithms to optimize irrigation maximize single field maize and soybean yield for various water supply scenarios the irrigation algorithm schedules irrigation events according to growth phase specific soil water thresholds the mycanesim sugarcane simulation system singels and paraskevopoulos 2017 has a sophisticated automatic irrigation algorithm that schedules irrigation events according to user specified soil water thresholds that may vary over the growing season seasonal water supply as well as irrigation system constraints paraskevopoulos 2015 although these applications are able to optimize irrigation over the growing season they all rely on a given water supply for a single field optimization across multiple fields spatially and temporally is therefore not possible ng cheong and teeluck 2018 developed software to assist sugarcane farmers in deciding how to distribute and schedule irrigation water on multiple fields it uses a simple water balance model to calculate soil water status for the different fields priorities are assigned based on growth phase germination stalk growth tillering and maturity ratoon stage and system efficiency the tool is designed for operational decision making regarding the next irrigation cycle although the tool was evaluated for user friendliness and usefulness the quality of the advice has not been evaluated irrigation water is distributed assuming that prescribed priorities will optimize irrigation in terms of crop yield and survival drought irrigation strategy decisions are complex and are based primarily on expected profitability and sustainability of the farming enterprise which will depend on crop responses on multiple fields ideally reliable information is required on the impacts of a given strategy decision on crop survival and financial profit at farm and field level although the systems reviewed here do provide some assistance for managing irrigation with limited water supply they do not address these aspects adequately the optimization goal seems to be yield maximization for one field at a time and not maximization of farm production or profitability in addition some of these make use of simple single soil layer single crop evaporation coefficient and untested soil water balance models and generic empirical yield prediction models with low temporal resolution e g growth phase total evapotranspiration deficit reliability of outputs depends on how realistic water balance and crop growth simulations are the aim of this work was to develop software to support farm level management of limited irrigation water for sugarcane production the software should support strategic planning to provide general guidance for the medium term 3 21 months rather than advice for short term operational management the specific objectives were to 1 develop a system for evaluating the impacts of a chosen irrigation strategy on future crop growth and yield and profitability at field and farm level for an assumed weather and water allocation scenario and 2 to evaluate the system for credibility and usefulness using south african case studies in summer rainfall areas in south africa the water management year runs from april to march government storage dams normally get filled from december to march the main rainfall period by march prevailing dam levels will largely dictate how water will be allocated for the rest of the water year assuming long term mean demand and supply for the next 12 months water allocations are updated on a weekly or monthly basis as the season progresses when dam levels drop below certain thresholds the water allocation for the next 12 months would be restricted there is therefore a need for south african sugarcane farmers and water managers to better understand the impact of the likely water allocation scenario on sugarcane production when this is announced by water managers a tool was needed to help managers work out a strategy for distributing available water on farms for the current and the following season and to understand the short and medium term financial impacts the impact of future rainfall also needed to be taken into account long lead forecasts of oceanic and atmospheric conditions such as el nino southern oscillation iri 2019 bom 2019 everingham et al 2008 that influence rainfall are becoming more reliable and could be used when exploring irrigation strategy impacts 2 system description 2 1 introduction the system was designed and built in collaboration with sugarcane farmers extension specialists and cane grower economists of the pongola and mpumalanga sugarcane producing areas in south africa sugarcane crops are typically harvested at 11 14 months between the months of april and december the industry required a system that could provide guidance on irrigation strategy for the medium term remainder of current season and possibly the following season after the water allocation regime outlook for the rest of the water year april to may is made known normally early april at the end of rainy season the idea is that the system be applied during periods of current and future expected limited water supply it can first be applied at the start of the milling season and then on occasions thereafter when the water allocation or rainfall outlook changes the system should enable evaluation of different irrigation strategies on crop status and economics and field and farm level strategies should include reducing irrigation frequencies and or amounts during specific growth phases and prioritizing fields for irrigation according to current and future yield potential 2 2 overview of components and data flow the system simulates crop growth for multiple fields under a given water allocation and weather scenario distributes available irrigation water across competing fields and schedules irrigation applications following a user defined irrigation strategy the system comprises a crop and water balance simulation model an irrigation module and a gross margin calculator coded in microsoft excel using vba a process based daily crop growth and water balance simulation model calculates the impact of specified irrigation strategies on crop yield and survival for the current an next season y1 and y2 under assumed future water supply allocation and climate scenarios available irrigation water is applied according to the specified irrigation strategy for each field and following the specified survival priority for each field irrigation strategies that can be explored include 1 scheduling rules based on growth phase specific soil water thresholds swt 2 adjusting drying off periods and 3 postponing replanting and or abandoning low potential fields farm level gross margins are then calculated for y1 and y2 from simulated yields and production costs at field level taking into account the feasibility of harvesting and the cost associated with replanting fields that failed the user specifies the nearest weather station and chooses one of three rainfall categories below near and above normal expected for the remainder of the current season the system compiles weather data for simulations using historic data that correspond to the chosen category for the period from april to the current date recently recorded data are used for the future period a past weather data sequence is selected to represent the future the selected sequence will fall in the same rainfall category for the relevant period in y1 than that chosen by the user other user inputs include the past and expected future weekly water allocation for the farm field inputs such as size crop cycle dates cultivar ratoon stage soil type irrigation system type the irrigation strategy for each field and financial information required for gross margin calculations outputs from the simulation include irrigation applied crop status alive failed yield and gross margin for each field for y1 and y2 as well as for the farm as a whole system components and data flow are illustrated in fig 1 and data organization is explained in table 1 2 3 model a balanced modelling approach in terms of complexity is required to achieve adequate prediction accuracy and operational practicality rapid simulation of multiple fields and scenarios soil water balance simulation should have a daily time step to capture effects of large rainfall events it should have a multi layered soil representation to capture rooting distribution effects on crop water status and it should distinguish between evaporation from the soil in order to account for different wetting patterns and frequencies and transpiration a strong driver of crop yield accuracy is also needed in simulating the formation and senescence of the crop canopy which determines radiation interception transpiration and photosynthesis the strong relationship between yield formation and transpiration found for sugarcane provides a convenient way of calculating cane yield while temperature and water status impacts on sucrose accumulation must be simulated to capture seasonal and irrigation effects on sucrose yields crop and canopy development and water balance aspects of the model use here are based on the simulation approach used in the canesim model singels and paraskevopoulos 2017 a precursor version of the canesim model has been evaluated for simulation of the water balance and unstressed canopy development singels et al 1998 singels and donaldson 2000 and these aspects are considered a solid basis to work from three phenological phases are simulated namely 1 germination phase during which buds sprout and emerge as primary shoots 2 the tillering phase during which the canopy and roots of the crop develop rapidly and 3 the stalk growth phase when the canopy is relatively full and the roots have colonized the soil profile the progression of these phases depends on thermal time and is calculated as in canesim a fourth phase is simulated during which irrigation is withheld to increase the sucrose content in cane stalks named the drying off phase see robertson and donaldson 1998 this phase commences a user specified number of days before the planned harvest date green canopy cover fi defined as the fractional interception of photosynthetically active radiation by green leaves is simulated as in canesim based on work by smit and singels 2006 but with three adjustments firstly no canopy expansion takes place when profile available soil water content is below 30 of capacity secondly the canopy expansion after water stress is relieved occurs at twice the rate of the reduction in green canopy during water stress based on findings by smit and singels 2006 this is to reflect the observed ability of sugarcane crops to accelerate leaf growth during recovery from water stress rossler 2014 thirdly green canopy decline senescence during water stress is allowed to continue past the lower limit set in canesim if water stress conditions persist and the crop is considered to have failed no prospect of recovery to a viable crop stand when the green canopy fraction declines below a value of 0 1 the following equations were used to simulate canopy senescence and recovery 1 fi fio 1 fwavg 2 fwavg σ fw fwperiod 3 fw 1 when gstress 0 5 and fw 2 when gstress 5 where fio is the potential unstressed canopy cover see singels and donaldson 2000 fwavg is the reduction in fractional canopy cover due to the net cumulative water stress experienced by the crop calculated by counting the number of days with water stress fw 1 and number of days with no water stress fw 2 the value of fw is derived from the water stress index for expansive growth gstress and is assigned a value of 1 for days that the crop experiences water stress gstress 0 5 and a value of 2 when the crop is unstressed and in recovery gstress 0 5 fwperiod is defined as the number of consecutive days with water stress required to reduce a full green canopy to zero a value of 100 d assumed based loosely on smit and singels 2006 a cascading water balance is maintained for a layered soil profile the number of soil layers depends on the chosen maximum effective rooting depth 30 60 100 140 cm layer thickness are 30 30 40 and 40 cm water flows and root development are calculated as in canesim it was decided to use a functional approach to calculating cane and sucrose yield focussing on water relations rather than the sophisticated biomass accumulation and partitioning alorithms available in existing crop simulation models such as dssat canegro jones and singels 2018 apsim sugar keating et al 1999 and canesim singels and paraskevopoulos 2017 it was important to simulate yield response to water accurately and to also keep it relatively simple to minimize computing time the cane yield calculation was therefore based on the algorithm used by singels et al 1999 which was derived from simulations from the canegro model a well tested model it was also important that yield calculations also account for soil cultivar and crop health differences between fields as these factors will cause differential yield responses to irrigation the following equations were used to calculated cane yield cy in t ha 4 cy te transcum transb 5 te tei δ transcum transb where te is the average transpiration efficiency at harvest defined as the cane yield produced per unit of transpiration during the stalk growth phase in t ha mm transcum is the cumulative transpiration at harvest since the start of the crop in mm and transb is the total transpiration from the crop emergence to the start of stalk growth in mm it has been shown that te declines as the crop matures park et al 2005 and van heerden et al 2010 and hence te was calculated as function of the initial te during early stalk growth tei and cumulative transpiration since the start of stalk growth see fig 2 parameter δ is the average decline in te per unit transpiration during the stalk growth phase in t ha mm tei is calculated as a function of maximum tei for a given field as determined by its yield potential category teo as well as ratoon stage ratoon 6 tei teo 1 ρ ratoon 1 ratoon crops 7 tei 95 teo plant crops parameter ρ is the fractional yield decline for each successive ratoon after the first ratoon a fractional decline rate of 0 037 ratoon was assumed based on the finding by ramburan et al 2013 that average yield decline rate equalled about 9 t ha ratoon for irrigated cane sucrose yield sy in t ha is the product of sucrose content sc and cane yield cy in t ha sc is calculated as non linear function of cy and a sucrose accumulation index rviavg 8 sc scmax 1 exp γ cy β 1 σ rviavg 0 6 0 75 0 6 where scmax is defined as the cultivar specific sucrose content of a 12 month crop at a reference maturity condition rviavg 0 6 γ is an empirical parameter determining the shape of the sc vs cy curve β is the cy where a sc of half the maximum value is reached and σ is the relative increase in sc when rviavg increases from 0 6 to 0 75 eq 8 is illustrated in fig 3 rviavg represents the maturity condition of the crop as impacted by mild water stress and cool temperatures over the most recent 21 days and is calculated as the average daily rvi over this period 9 rvi ft fw 2 where 10 ft 1 1 exp 0 32 tmean 25 from singels and bezuidenhout 2002 and 11 fw 1 swsi 0 5 from singels and bezuidenhout 2002 where swsi is the soil water satisfaction index which is determined by the availability of soil water in relation to the demand value of 1 for ample water zero for no water eq 8 attempts to capture the effect of thermal maturity of the crop and recent temperature and water status conditions on the sucrose accumulation process table 2 simulated yields were compared to yields measured for cultivar nco376 in 26 diverse experiments conducted in south africa that included water stressed and well water scenarios singels and bezuidenhout 2002 simulation accuracy of the new model was satisfactory and as good as the standard canesim model singels and paraskevopoulos 2017 for predicting cane yield r2 0 88 root mean square error rmse 16 t ha n 137 sucrose yields were not as accurate r2 0 88 rmse 4 1 t ha n 135 compared to r2 0 88 rmse 3 9 t ha for the standard canesim model overall the model was considered sufficiently reliable for predicting crop response to irrigation weather and soil factors to be included in the software package 2 4 irrigation module the irrigation module evaluates current simulated soil water content and crop status growth phase and crop vigour for a given field in the context of the irrigation strategy specified for that field as well the remaining water availability for each week to schedule an irrigation event for the given field the algorithm logic is illustrated in fig 4 an irrigation strategy consists of four basic elements field level restriction the first option is to apply or not apply the restricted water allocation during the drought period period with restricted farm water allocation for the given field named the pro rata option when the pro rata option is chosen it will restrict cumulative irrigation applied since the start of the drought from exceeding the cumulative water allocation at that point in time the latter is calculated as the product of the annual water allocation for the drought period expressed as a fraction of the normal unrestricted allocation and the long term mean cumulative irrigation demand since the start of the drought period see paraskevopoulos 2015 for details generally when the pro rata option is chosen limited water will be used to irrigated more fields compared to when the option is not chosen field specific irrigation scheduling triggers irrigations are scheduled assuming adequate water supply using user specified soil water thresholds swt defined for each of the germination g tillering t and stalk growth s phases irrigations can be scheduled when available soil water content reaches the specified threshold typically 60 30 or 20 of capacity irrigations are withheld during the maturation drying off phase the start and end of the maturation phase is specified by the user and the duration can thus be varied in order to manipulate water distribution between fields survival priority all fields on the farm need to be assigned a priority ranking which will determine the order in which fields will queue for water in a given week normally high potential fields with efficient irrigation systems will be assigned higher priorities compared to low potential fields with less efficient irrigation systems abandonment specifies whether a given field should be abandoned that is not receive any irrigation or other inputs after the harvest of the previous crop this may be a feasible option for fields that are likely to fail or make a financial loss options also exist for varying irrigation amounts and or cycle periods minimum duration between consecutive irrigations in an attempt to alter water distribution across different fields on the farm 2 5 gross margin module the gross margin gm for each field for the current y1 and the next season y2 is calculated by subtracting the crop establishment costs cbase irrigation costs cirr harvest costs char and transport costs ctrans from the income derived from delivered cane costs and income vary depending on the status of the crop and how it was treated fig 5 when harvesting char in r ha plus transport ctrans in r ha costs exceeds potential income or when cane yield is less than 35 t ha then harvesting will not take place the gm is then taken as the negative sum of cirr and cbase and the cost of slashing back the living crop eq 13 the cost of slashing back is taken as the product of cane yield cy in t ha and the unit cost of cutting cane ccut in r t when the crop is dead the gross margin is taken as the negative sum of cirr and cbase only eq 14 12 gm income cbase cirr char ctrans when income char ctrans or with cy 35 t ha 13 gm cbase cirr cy ccut for living crops with income char ctrans or with cy 35 t ha 14 gm cbase cirr for dead crops income is calculated as the product of the recoverable

content rvc in is 2 units below the sucrose content of cane suc in 16 rvy rvc cy 17 rvc suc 2 irrigation costs cirr in r ha are taken as the sum of cost of capital investment and operational costs water electricity and labour associated with irrigation application 18 cirr ccap 100 gperiod 365 cinv cwefix gperiod 365 irr cwevar clabour gperiod 365 where ccap is the unit cost of capital annum gperiod is the growing period duration in d cinv is the initial capital investment required to establish the irrigation system r ha irr is the amount of irrigation applied per crop mm cwefix and cwevar are fixed and variable water plus electricity costs r ha annum and r mm respectively and clabour is labour costs r ha annum harvesting costs char is calculated as 19 char cburn cspread cy ccut cload where ccut and cload is the unit cost of cutting and loading r t cburn and cspread is the unit area cost of burning and spreading green tops r ha respectively transport costs are the product of the unit cost and cane yield 20 ctrans ctru cy cbase is calculated as the cost of establishment of the plant cestp or ratoon crop cestr plus the investment required for re establishment of a plant crop after the ratoon cycle of eight crops has been completed crest 21 cbase cestp crest for plant crops cbase cestr crest for ratoon crops the investment required for crop re establishment is taken as the difference in cost between establishment of a plant and ratoon crop divided in eight equal instalments over the length of the ratoon cycle when the crop fails the instalment is ramped up in proportion to the relative number of ratoon crops that were lost eq 22 22 crest cestp cestr 1 rat 8 for crop failure where rat refers the ratoon crop number where 0 is the plant crop gm calculations for season three y3 are not based on model simulations and are merely broad indications of the impact of crop failure in y1 and y2 on potential future income it is based on assumptions regarding rv yield cy 120 t ha rvc 0 12 crop age at harvest 12 months and irrigation amounts long term mean irrigation requirement for all surviving fields y3 gm for fields with no crops was taken as zero farm average gross margin for each season is calculated by summing cane production t that was delivered to the mill and dividing it by the area of fields that was harvested for the given season 3 case studies 3 1 farm set up the hypothetical farm consisted of 18 fields of 1 ha each near komatipoort mpumalanga sixteen of these fields had cane growing on them with ratoon stages varying from a plant crop through to ratoon stage 7 crops were harvested and started on the 15th of each month of the milling season april to december for the base case two fields were fallowed in year 1 and got planted in year 2 while two fields with ratoon stage 7 in year 1 were fallowed in year 2 fields had identical soils with available water capacity of 100 mm overhead irrigation with a normal application of 35 mm and a minimum cycle period of 5 days were assumed daily weather data from the ten bosch weather station near komatipoort 25 33 s 31 57 e 170 masl for the period april 2014 to december 2016 were used as weather input the current date was taken as 1 october 2014 and the farmer learnt that given current water supply levels there was a strong probability that water restrictions will be imposed from january 2015 if dam inflows remain below normal water supply may be restricted for 12 months or longer depending on when good rainfall in the catchment will restore dam levels to the required thresholds in real world applications the system will select a past weather data sequence that most closely matches expected future weather as indicated by long term rainfall forecasts for the hypothetical case here a perfect forecast was assumed weather data for 2014 15 16 were used for simulations farm set up and time lines of crop growing periods harvesting periods and water restrictions are illustrated in fig 6 3 2 water allocations four restricted water allocation scenarios were investigated namely a mildly and severely restricted allocation 600 and 300 mm annum respectively applied over a long january 2015 to december 2016 and short january 2016 to december 2016 period the full non restricted allocation for this area is 1300 mm annum it should be noted that for this case study the allocation applied to area under cane 16 ha and not total cultivated area 18 ha the annual allocation alloc in mm was distributed between the 52 weeks of the water year april to may based on ratio of the long term mean estimated irrigation demand for a given week irrdemw in mm to the long term mean annual irrigation demand irrdem in mm 23 allocw irrdemw irrdem alloc where allocw is the weekly allocation irrdemw was taken as difference between long term mean weekly reference sugarcane evapotranspiration ecrefw as defined by mcglinchey and inman bamber 1996 and 70 of long term mean weekly rainfall rw only positive values for each week of the year averaged over the period 2001 2016 irrdemw 1 16 σ ecrefw 1 16 σ 0 7 rw and ecrefw 0 7 rw 24 monthly rainfall water allocation and long term mean irrigation demand for selected scenarios are shown in fig 7 3 3 irrigation strategies preliminary runs showed that the pro rata option produced the best outcomes for restricted water allocation scenarios because it distributed the water across fields in a better way swt values of 60 30 and 20 of plant available soil water capacity were used for the tillering t and stalk growth s phases preliminary runs indicated that using swt of less than 60 in the germination g phase were irrational as this led to underutilization of available water and excessive crop death the standard drying off period varied from 28 days to 50 days depending on harvest month pers comm f c olivier 2017 sasri mount edgecombe an extended drying off period for periods d2 with restricted water supply was also investigated by bringing forward the start of the drying off period by one week fields were assigned priorities for survival according to the ratoon class with plant crop fields having the highest priority and 7th ratoon fields the lowest priority field management strategies consisted of 1 not replanting the two fields that were due for replanting in y2 and 2 abandoning low potential fields or fields that are due to fail irrigation strategies were therefore defined in terms of number of fields to be abandoned a swts used to trigger irrigations in the germination g tillering t and stalk growth s phases and the duration of the drying period d1 normal d2 extended for example the strategy code a5 g60 t30 s60 d1 refers to a strategy where five fields were abandoned swt of 60 30 and 60 were used for the germination tillering and stalk growth phases respectively and crops underwent the standard drying off period 4 results results for the baseline irrigation strategy a0 g60 t60 s60 d1 under the long and severe water restriction scenario are shown in fig 8 water restrictions started in january 2015 and fields with lower priorities fields 8 16 got little or no water from january to april 2015 when harvesting commenced in april 2015 this allowed the saving of water on young ratooning fields fields 1 7 which could be applied on maturing crops fields 9 16 this enabled the survival of all fields in 2015 although yields were depressed on some of the fields to the point where a financial loss were made fields 13 16 from october 2015 to october 2016 water allocation was only adequate to irrigated fields 1 11 and two replanted fields field 17 and 18 with the result that three fields failed field 12 14 yields and gms for surviving fields were mostly lower in 2016 than in 2015 due to the longer period of restricted water supply farm average gm was also much lower the results from this simulation suggest possible adjustments to the irrigation strategy could be explored to mitigate negative impacts these include 1 not planting in y2 in an attempt to save some of the older ratoons 2 abandoning fields that were due to die to save irrigation water and costs 3 using a lower swt for selected phases to see whether available water could be used on more fields without affecting farm profitability and 4 extending the drying off period to use available water on more fields without affecting farm profitability the next section deals with exploring different irrigation strategies for the different water allocation scenarios simulation results are summarized in table 4 gross margin results for these are shown fig 9 the main findings emerging from these are long mild water restriction 24mo x600 mm annum not planting in y2 increased y2 gm but also led to crop failure in one additional field compared to the base line strategy a0 g60 t60 s60 d1 y2 gm was increased further by abandoning two additional low potential fields using swt g60 t30 s60 caused one more field to fail and reducing y2 gm marginally compared to the baseline strategy an extended drying off period had little effect and reduced y2 gm slightly compared to the corresponding standard drying off strategies long severe water restriction 24mo x300 mm annum a similar response to abandoning fields was achieved for the 300 mm water allocation increasing y2 gm but causing a drop in projected y3 gm due to fewer fields having viable crops using swt g60 t30 s60 caused crops on two more fields to fail compared to the baseline strategy while gm in y1 and y2 were similar to that of the baseline strategies using swt g60 t30 s30 performed worse than the baseline strategies in terms of gm and crop survival and was therefore not a good option to take short mild restriction 12mo x600 mm annum using swt g60 t30 s60 produced similar results to the baseline strategy not planting in y2 increased gm extending the drying off period in y2 saved one additional field compared to the baseline strategy using swt g60 t30 s30 succeeded in saving all fields including newly planted fields in y2 with only a small reduction in y2 gm compared to the baseline this suggest that deficit irrigation applied throughout the growing period could be a feasible option when the restrictions are not that severe and for a relatively short period short severe restriction 12mo x300 mm annum using swt g60 s30 t60 performed similarly or slightly worse than the baseline strategy extending the drying off period succeeded in saving one additional field using swt g60 t30 s30 also saved one additional field compared to corresponding baseline strategies overall using a swt g60 t20 s20 caused increased crop failure and large yield and gm reductions for all water allocation scenarios compared to the baseline strategies 5 concluding discussion a system was developed for assessing sugarcane farm irrigation strategies during drought periods when current and future water supply are expected to be insufficient it is designed to be applied on multiple fields with a shared water allocation to explore best ways of distributing the available supply spatially and temporally over two seasons previous work reported in the literature dealt with single fields and seasons only and spatial optimization has not been addressed sophisticated field and growth phase specific irrigation scheduling and field prioritization rules can be iteratively evaluated for assumed likely future weather and water supply scenarios as suggested by long term forecasts irrigation strategies can be re evaluated when new water supply and climate information becomes available the information generated by the system serves as a guide to support strategic irrigation and other crop management decisions during prolonged drought periods some features can be considered advancements on what have been used in limited irrigation management support systems reported in the literature the crop growth and water balance model is relatively sophisticated with high temporal resolution it makes use of a daily time step as opposed to weekly or growth phase time steps multi layer as opposed to single soil water balance with separation as opposed to combined simulation of soil evaporation e and transpiration t these features are important for realistic simulation of water balance as affected by large rainfall events different soil wetting patterns caused by different irrigation systems and rooting distribution with depth simulation of crop canopy responds dynamically to crop water status in addition to temperature and row spacing cane yield is driven by t and not et during the stalk growth phase and was shown to be accurate while sucrose yield is driven by crop water status and temperature these aspects enables more realistic simulations of crop response to water than simpler empirical models that have been used for sugarcane irrigation optimization some aspects of the program need further testing and possible refinement these include the simulation of canopy senescence and crop failure due to prolonged water deficit and the simulation of sucrose content management decision need to be based on financial information the system developed here combines biophysical and financial information through the calculation of gross margins these account for crop establishment costs and focus on fixed and variable irrigation costs as well as harvesting and transport costs estimated yields are used to determine feasibility of harvesting the cost of re establishing failed crops are calculated based on the ratoon stage of the failed crop the hypothetical case studies presented here suggest that the program produced realistic responses to irrigation applied and drought it has enough flexibility to accommodate site specific conditions and preferences typically the program will be run when a drought is looming or irrigation water supply is under threat the program will be set up to simulate the completion of the current season y1 as well as the next season y2 by assuming the most likely rainfall and water supply scenario based on long term forecasts the program can be used to provide broad guidelines for minimising the short and medium term impacts of protracted limited water supply on irrigated sugarcane production it can also be used to estimate impacts of a given water supply scenario on farm production and profitability it has the potential to be used for optimizing water distribution between farms as well as between regions by setting up and simulating virtual but representative cropping scenarios it also has the potential for supporting strategic agronomic decisions such as optimizing field deployment of cultivars and irrigation systems optimizing harvesting and planting schedules and assessing economic consequences of applying different harvesting and irrigation systems potential users include managers of large sugarcane farms and regional water use managers the latter can set up representative simulations to represent important agro climatic zones in a given water use district to explore impacts of spatial and temporal variation in water allocations over large areas work is underway to develop an algorithm to automate the iterative formulation of irrigation strategies for a given set of condition and subsequent evaluation of their impacts on crop status and profitability a simple queueing of fields for weekly water could also be upgraded to evaluate the impact of weekly distribution and refine it if needed but this will require a new simulation approach using object oriented programming acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge valuable inputs from sugarcane farmers sasri extension specialists and s a canegrowers

10967,tomato is one of the most widely grown vegetables in the world because of special nutritive value of its fruit regulated deficit irrigation rdi is widely applied in tomato production due to the water shortage a lot of studies demonstrated that certain degree of deficit irrigation decreased the tomato yield but improved the fruit quality the purpose of this paper is to use a meta analysis to 1 estimate the effect of rdi on processing tomato yield water use efficiency and fruit quality 2 identify soil texture growth stage and deficit severity that benefit yield and increase water use efficiency compared to full irrigation we analyzed 25 research articles with 561 experimental groups and 145 control groups overall rdi decreased processing tomato yield with mean difference of 18 61 t ha 1 increased water use efficiency with mean difference of 2 33 kg m 3 and improved fruit quality the yield decreased with mean difference of 19 79 t ha 1 in loamy soil and 14 26 t ha 1 in non loamy soil the soil texture had no significant effects on yield and water use efficiency under severe rdi application of rdi at the first stage is recommended because of no significant yield loss and significant increase of water use efficiency rdi can improve processing tomato total soluble solids and vitamin c moreover both of them were increased more when rdi was applied at the third stage than at previous two stages our findings can be helpful on how to use rdi correctly to balance the processing tomato yield water conservation and fruit quality keywords tomato yield regulated deficit

billion people all over the world at present mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 it is crucial to develop water saving practices with the potential to increase water use efficiency while maintaining yields and fruit quality or reducing yields a little to support a growing population water is an increasingly rare resource and agricultural irrigation consumes a large amount of water resources which is not efficiently used water security is the basis for food security water is a key factor to yield and crop quality but water resources become rare to agriculture due to the increasing demands of household and industry bogale et al 2016 deficit irrigation is beneficial to save water it s a practice that deliberately allows crops to maintain water deficit at some degree sometimes with losing yield lightly and significantly reducing irrigation water use english and raja 1996 kirda et al 2004 cantore et al 2016 giuliani et al 2016 regulated deficit irrigation rdi has been proved to potentially save water in agriculture and it allows crops to bear mild water stress with no or only minimal decline of yield and quality costa et al 2007 many investigations studied the potential advantages of deficit irrigation in increasing water use efficiency in crop production chai et al 2016 at the present time rdi is used as a strategy of water saving many studies reported that rdi was helpful to save water and improve crop quality wang et al 2005 li et al 2013 ji et al 2015 irrigation is thought to be one of the key factors to influence plant water status many studies have indicated that deficit irrigation can enhance tomato fruit quality mitchell et al 1991 pulupol et al 1996 veit köhler et al 1999 johnstone et al 2005 favati et al 2009 patanè and cosentino 2010 wang et al 2011

human health and pleasure it can lower the risk of developing some cancers giovannucci et al 1995 franceschi et al 1994 water deficit usually leads to decreased photosynthesis plant growth and crop productivity and beneficial effects on some fruit quality parameters for instance increased antioxidant compound levels and higher sugar accumulation ripoll et al 2016 given these benefits many efforts have been made to disseminate rdi particularly in china the definition of the influence of deficit irrigation on processing tomato fruit yield and quality are poor due to its complexity though there are lots of articles renquist and reid 2001 marouelli and silva 2007 favati et al 2009 what s more few studies patanè and cosentino 2010 quantified the effects of deficit irrigation on processing tomato at different growth stages in this regard we conducted a meta analysis with the following objectives 1 quantify the effect of rdi on processing tomato yield water use efficiency and fruit quality 2 identify soil texture growth stage and deficit severity that benefit yield and increase water use efficiency compared to full irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection a comprehensive literature search was conducted on isi web of science science direct and china national knowledge internet for articles published from april 1960 to february 2019 about tomato under deficit irrigation the literature search was conducted with a focus on the following keywords 1 tomato yield and regulated deficit irrigation 2 tomato quality and regulated deficit irrigation 3 water use efficiency and regulated deficit irrigation after preliminary collection we checked the varieties of tomato and the articles about tomato for processing were collected publications which consist of field experiments or pot experiments with contrast of rdi and the control without water deficit ck were chosen here rdi technique mainly refers to that the plant sensitivity to water stress is not continuous at stages of crops growth period costa et al 2007 in all situations experiments with rdi were included except for collecting yield data from each research we also recorded data on water use efficiency since the yield in each paper was a little different such as total yield total marketable yield and total fresh weight and so on we collected all of them as variable yield the ratio between photosynthesis and transpiration at physiological level is the definition of water use efficiency wue for agronomic evaluations zhang et al 2017 wue was calculated as i the ratio between dry above ground biomass and evapotranspiration i e biomass wue b wue and ii the ratio between marketable yield and evapotranspiration i e yield wue y wue cantore et al 2016 for this study we just collected the data of yield wue in addition to collecting the interesting response variables yield wue we also collected soil variables such as texture the general soil texture groups include three classes sandy loamy or clayey based on usda soil texture classes usda 1993 in our study loamy soil was one group and sandy and clayey soil was non loamy soil group moreover rdi timing data were also collected the rdi timing means when water deficit was applied at the different growing stage since the treatments about the time of rdi were different in each articles the rdi timing were divided into three stages 1 the first stage it begins from transplanting to first fruit setting it was abbreviated as v stage 2 the second stage it begins from first fruit setting to first fruit maturity it was abbreviated as f stage 3 the third stage it begins from first fruit maturity to uprooting crops and after all fruits are harvested it was abbreviated as r stage the rdi timing was classified into 1 water deficit happened only during one of the stage such as at the first the second or the third stage 2 water deficit occurred throughout the season and it meant water deficit last for a long time not just applied only during one of the growth stages referred above after the rigorous search and selection we identified 25 articles in the final document data bases the experiments reported on selected articles were different consisting of 561 experimental groups and 145 control groups table 1 the experimental groups stood for the rdi treatments and the control groups stood for no water deficit irrigation

study the outcome of variables yield water use efficiency total soluble solids and vitamin c were continuous so we used wmds to do the analysis because the units of variables in most articles

the p value following z stood for statistical significance the results were significant when the p value following z was smaller than 0 05 mean difference md was the difference between two means and it stood for the effect of absolute values between multiple studies 3 results 3 1 overall impact of rdi on yield water use efficiency 3 1 1 effect of rdi on yield studies with available data on processing tomato yield were gathered together for a visual representation of the results fig 1 the effect of rdi on yield had statistical significance z 5 26 p 0 00001 there was heterogeneity between the studies i2 100 p 0 00001 in general rdi decreased yield when comparing it with the control group md 18 61 95 ci 25 54 to 11 68 3 1 2 effect of rdi on water use efficiency as shown in fig 2 rdi resulted in a significant change in water use efficiency with overall effect size z of 3 25 p 0 001 however there was heterogeneity between the studies i2 95 p 0 00001 compared with ck rdi increased water use efficiency md 2 33 95 ci 0 92 to 3 74 3 2 soil texture and management practices affecting yield in rdi with respect to soil texture we have observed impact on rdi yield rdi yield decreased compared to ck in all situations fig 3 when rdi was applied in loamy soils yield decreased more md 19 79 95 ci 26 53 to 13 06 in contrast to the experiments md 14 26 95 ci 20 21 to 8 31 when practicing in non loamy soils about water management we checked the phenological stage at which the water deficit was imposed rdi timing and its severity these studies were significantly heterogeneous i2 100 p 0 00001 under the random effects model the ck favored yield compared to rdi md 18 61 95 ci 25 54 to 11 68 when rdi was carried out during the entire season yield decreased md 21 33 95 ci 31 36 to 11 29 it also made some difference when rdi was carried out at one of the three stages md 15 24 95 ci 20 44 to 10 03 from fig 4 we found out that the effects of rdi on yield were not so different in throughout season group and not throughout season group with the purpose of a detailed study on how the rdi affected yield at different growth stages we did an analysis on yield at three different stages we collected 249 experiments from 8 articles no significant difference in yield was found at v and f stage and the md were 1 49 95 ci 4 96 to 1 99 p 0 40 and 10 42 95 ci 22 29 to 1 45 p 0 09 respectively fig 5 however rdi caused significant changes on yield at r stage the yield decreased with the overall effect size z of 3 59 p 0 00001 the md was 14 77 95 ci 22 84 to 6 71 p 0 0003 in order to find the effect of rdi severity on tomato yield we classified data into two groups if the irrigation amount was less than 50 of the control group rdi was classified as severe rdi the rest was considered as mild rdi taking the soil texture into consideration we did a subgroup analysis on the basis of the rdi severity from fig 6 we discovered that yield decreased more in loamy soil than in non loamy soil the md was 25 94 95 ci 29 40 to 22 49 in loamy soil group and the md was 16 46 95 ci 31 48 to 1 43 in non loamy soil group the result was the same as that of fig 3 the purpose of the subgroup analysis was to find whether the severe water deficit responded differently in different soil textures compared to mild water deficit 3 3 soil texture and management practices affecting water use efficiency in rdi we took 387 experiments from 13 articles for comparison of the influence of soil texture on processing tomato water use efficiency from fig 7 we concluded that the soil texture significantly affected water use efficiency under rdi the md was 2 82 95 ci 0 02 to 5 65 in loamy soil however water use efficiency significantly increased in non loamy soil with the md of 2 48 95 ci 0 51 to 4 46 the effects of the rdi timing on water use efficiency was presented in fig 8 which was calculated from 387 experiment data wue significantly increased in groups throughout the season md 2 83 95 ci 0 70 to 4 95 the data of the groups not throughout the season showed wue did not significantly increase with the md was 2 08 95 ci 0 36 to 4 52 we gathered available data on studies about how water use efficiency responded in different growth stages when rdi was carried out one hundred and fifty six data were pooled from 4 articles fig 9 showed that water use efficiency displayed no significant change at all stages except for the first stage for the values of p were 0 04 at v stage 0 78 at f stage and 0 50 at r stage the result is the same as fig 8 in which we conducted a subgroup analysis about the timing of rdi with the same purpose of finding the effect of rdi severity on tomato yield we also divided the experiments into two groups to search out the effect of rdi severity on tomato water use efficiency the overall effect size z of loamy soil texture subgroup was 1 55 p 0 12 from fig 10 the result indicated that soil texture had no significant effect on water use efficiency under severe rdi the md was 4 87 95 ci 6 89 to 16 64 and 3 15 95 ci 1 41 to 7 71 respectively 3 4 effect of rdi on tomato quality 3 4 1 effect of rdi on tomato total soluble solids eleven studies reported on the relationship between total soluble solids and rdi the data from the 292 samples showed that rdi increased total soluble solids with mean difference of 0 80 95 ci 0 49 to 1 11 in processing tomato the overall effect size was 5 13 p 0 00001 the studies had heterogeneity because of i2 of 94 fig 11 during the growth stages tomato total soluble solids responded differently to rdi from the 118 samples we concluded that conducting rdi at r stage increased more total soluble solids than that at f stage however rdi had no significant effect on total soluble solids at v stage from fig 12 we learned that the md was 0 48 95 ci 0 22 to 1 18 at v stage 1 08 95 ci 0 20 to 1 96 at f stage and 1 15 95 ci 0 57 to 1 72 at r stage respectively 3 4 2 effect of rdi on tomato vitamin c the effect of rdi on tomato vitamin c was reported by 9 heterogeneous studies i2 97 p 0 00001 fig 13 so we took a random model to do the analysis rdi associated with increase in vitamin c md 2 96 95 ci 1 36 to 4 56 p 0 0003 vitamin c increased at r stage more than at f stage fig 14 and the result was similar as the effect of rdi on total soluble solids in different stages at v stage the md was 0 07 95 ci 0 85 to 0 99 p 0 89 at f stage the md was 1 09 95 ci 0 32 to 1 87 p 0 006 at r stage the md was 2 26 95 ci 1 48 to 3 04 p 0 00001 4 discussion 4 1 rdi influencing yield water is important to the growth of tomatoes rdi applied to tomato is helpful in declining production cost and protecting water resources the application of rdi decreased tomato yield it proved that tomato is one of the crops which need large water volumes peet 2005 a lot of studies had found that deficit irrigation to a certain degree declined tomato yield zegbe domínguez et al 2003 kirda et al 2004 patanè et al 2011 though depending on the period and the degree of water stress helyes and varga 1994 nuruddin et al 2003 zegbe et al 2006 whether the soil is loamy or not the yield decreased and it decreased more in loamy soil fig 3 different soil texture may have different effect on tomato root system development thus affects yield differently the effect of soil texture on root system development had been explored in previous studies konôpka et al 2008 tracy et al 2013 de pascale et al 2015 had done experiments about the effects of irrigation and soil type on grown tomatoes if we divided the experiment data into two subgroups according to the rdi timing we found the effects of rdi on tomato yield were a little different fig 4 for a deeper study we classified the time of rdi into three stages and we could find which stage affected tomato yield more from fig 5 we concluded that there was no significant yield penalty at the first stage early rdi did not significantly affect yield since water deficit at the vegetative stage is too early to influence tomato growth which agreed with the previous studies ngouajio et al 2007 marouelli et al 2004 furthermore the data showed that processing tomato yield decreased when carrying out rdi at the third stage this conclusion demonstrated that processing tomato was sensitive to water stress at fruit ripening stage moreover the sensitivity to water stress at the three growth stages were not equal in this study the yield at the third stage significantly decreased while the yield did not significantly decreased in other two stages fig 5 the possible reason was that the third stage was a key period for tomato plants and the fruit growth stage was most responsible to improve tomato yield kirda et al 2004 nuruddin et al 2003 reported that sensitivity to water stress occurred primarily during fruit growth rather than flowering and fruit set marouelli and silva 2007 found that yield decreased when regulated deficit irrigation occurred during fruit maturation growth stages primarily because of many small green fruits aborting or not enlarging under water deficit conditions the response of tomato to deficit irrigation not only depends on the period of water deficit but also on the degree of water deficit we grouped the experiment data into two categories according to irrigation water amount the severe rdi group included treatments in which the amount of irrigation water was less than 50 of that in the treatments without water deficit and the rest was mild rdi group compared to mild rdi group severe rdi group declined tomato yield with mean difference of 22 65 t ha 1 fig 6 the figure suggested that the irrigation amount should not be less than 50 of the irrigation water in treatments without water deficit if the water deficit was severe tomato yield decreased favati et al 2009 had indicated that the yield of processing tomatoes decreased when the irrigation water was only 50 of crop evapotranspiration in a mediterranean climate condition the result was in agreement with previous study wiertz and lenz 1987 which found yield was more negatively affected by low water supply deficit irrigation treatments received 1 3 or 2 3 irrigation amount of control group at three different growth stages of tomato were set in previous study wang et al 2011 and the yields in 1 3 irrigation amount of control group treatments were all less than that in 2 3 irrigation amount of control group treatments it may indicate that the degree of water deficit could not be too severe what s more tomato yield was more sensitive in loamy soil in contrast to non loamy soil in conclusion tomato tolerance of severe deficit irrigation was stronger in non loamy soil than in loamy soil as a suggestion we would better apply severe rdi in non loamy soil if water resources are rare and it could reduce the influence of water stress on tomato yield ezzo et al 2010 studied the effect of interaction between irrigation water levels and soil types on sweet pepper and found the interaction significantly affected plant length leaves and total fresh weight and root dry weight the same results were found by abo hussein 1995 on potato el zeiny and ibrahim 2006 applied irrigation water of 80 and 100 et0 to tomato grown in clay soil and found that the capability of plants to produce the vigorous vegetative growth was inspired however there are little studies about the effect of interaction between the water deficit severity and soil textures on tomato yield maybe later studies could study this aspect 4 2 rdi influencing water use efficiency the shortage of water is one of the limits to crop production in the world though rdi made tomato yield loss water use efficiency was positively affected by water deficit as fig 2 showed in other words it saved water which agreed with the results reported by topcu et al 2007 the possibility to save irrigation water and make water use efficiency rise was proved by the experimental results by benković and rakočević 2011 with water resources becoming scarcer this is an important advantage of rdi the fact that water use efficiency increased under deficit irrigation could be owed to the stomata closure zegbe et al 2007 factually the control of stomata aperture represents a key aspect in the regulation of the wue the soil texture had significant effect on water use efficiency fig 7 moreover wue significantly increased in non loamy soil while it didn t in loamy soil water use efficiency significantly increased when the application of rdi was throughout the whole growth stage on the other hand there was no significant change in water use efficiency when application of rdi was at one of the tomato growth stage or just for a period in a detailed analysis fig 9 wue significantly increased at the first stage while it did not significantly increase at the other two stages under rdi in order to find out how water use efficiency responded to severe water deficit in different soil texture we classified the treatments into two groups in each article the treatments in which the amount of irrigation water was less than 50 of that in the control group were severe rdi group and the rest were mild rdi group the md indicated water use efficiency under severe rdi group didn t significantly change in both soils fig 10 the result was a little different from that of fig 7 and the reason may be the severity of rdi a majority of studies patanè et al 2011 chen et al 2013 had reported the increases in water use efficiency of tomato crop under rdi what s more water use efficiency acted differently to soil textures with the same level of deficit irrigation the result was proved in the studies of katerji et al 2010 and turner 2004 there are many other factors affecting the water use efficiency varietal tolerance to water stress katerji et al 2008 the sensitivity of the growth stage to stress kirda et al 1999 the climate zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 from fig 6 the result showed that yield decreased less in non loamy soil than that in loamy soil under severe rdi and from fig 10 it showed that soil texture did not have significantly effects on wue under severe rdi taking yield and wue into consideration if water is in shortage it will be better for transplanting tomato in non loamy soil under severe rdi because of the less yield loss 4 3 rdi influencing quality even though rdi had an unsatisfactory effect on tomato yield fruit quality was improved to some extent fruit yield and soluble solids displayed a negative correlation in most cases as marouelli and silva 2007 also found the benefit of rdi on fruit quality has been largely reported in studies johnstone et al 2005 patanè and cosentino 2010 from fig 11 we concluded that deficit irrigation increased total soluble solids md 0 80 95 ci 0 49 to 1 11 in tomato compared to control groups vitamin c also increased cutting water down resulted in a reduction of fruit water content and thus increased the fruit soluble solids content some studies concluded that water stress could promote vitamin c and soluble solids zegbe domínguez et al 2003 favati et al 2009 patanè and cosentino 2010 patanè et al 2011 both total soluble solids and vitamin c were increased when rdi was applied at the second and the third stage fig 12 and fig 14 but both of them increased more when rdi was applied at the last stage it is anticipated that deficit irrigation at the first stage does not affect the content of total soluble solids and vitamin c evidently because it s too early to influence them total soluble solids were enhanced under rdi at the third stage it was mainly due to a declined water accumulation in fruits and the lower dilution of fruits components without any significant change in the quantity of accumulated sugars guichard et al 1999 quite a lot of studies observed that deficit irrigation positively affected vitamin c favati et al 2009 patanè et al 2011 veit köhler et al 1999 assumed that accumulating more sugar combined with providing less water helped vitamin c synthesis in the period of fruit ripening moreover leaf area index was reduced under deficit irrigation and hence the light intensity and duration was increased which favored the accumulation of vitamin c dumas et al 2003 the reason why tomato quality improved under deficit irrigation was that tomato fruit would be the strongest sink for assimilating nutrients among the plant s organs gamareldawla et al 2017 once the tomato crop was under water deficit the plant would control some metabolic activities such as osmotic adjustment to preferentially re allocate more sucrose to the sink organs and to increase the organic acid transformation rate consequently the gradient of sucrose concentration between the leaves and fruits would increase qi et al 2003 as a result fruits assimilate more to enhance vitamin c 5 conclusions the results of this study showed that soil texture had significant effect on tomato yield under severe rdi tomato yield decreased more in loamy soil than that in non loamy soil in terms of the growth stage the reduction of processing tomato yield was obvious under rdi at the third stage compared to other stages water use efficiency significantly increased in non loamy soil while not in loamy soil the timing affected the water use efficiency when the time was classified into three stages water use efficiency under rdi significantly increased at the first stage it is beneficial to tomato if rdi was applied in non loamy soil since yield decreased less and water use efficiency increased moreover it is also beneficial to tomato if severe rdi was applied in non loamy soil the implementation of rdi can improve tomato total soluble solids and vitamin c what s more both increased more under rdi at the third stage than at previous two stages application of rdi at the first stage is recommended because yield does not significantly decrease and water use efficiency significantly increases although application of rdi at the third stage could improve fruit quality it decreased fruit yield the application of rdi under severe conditions needs more study to balance the yield loss and the increase of water use efficiency acknowledgement the research was supported by key program granted by the national nature

10967,tomato is one of the most widely grown vegetables in the world because of special nutritive value of its fruit regulated deficit irrigation rdi is widely applied in tomato production due to the water shortage a lot of studies demonstrated that certain degree of deficit irrigation decreased the tomato yield but improved the fruit quality the purpose of this paper is to use a meta analysis to 1 estimate the effect of rdi on processing tomato yield water use efficiency and fruit quality 2 identify soil texture growth stage and deficit severity that benefit yield and increase water use efficiency compared to full irrigation we analyzed 25 research articles with 561 experimental groups and 145 control groups overall rdi decreased processing tomato yield with mean difference of 18 61 t ha 1 increased water use efficiency with mean difference of 2 33 kg m 3 and improved fruit quality the yield decreased with mean difference of 19 79 t ha 1 in loamy soil and 14 26 t ha 1 in non loamy soil the soil texture had no significant effects on yield and water use efficiency under severe rdi application of rdi at the first stage is recommended because of no significant yield loss and significant increase of water use efficiency rdi can improve processing tomato total soluble solids and vitamin c moreover both of them were increased more when rdi was applied at the third stage than at previous two stages our findings can be helpful on how to use rdi correctly to balance the processing tomato yield water conservation and fruit quality keywords tomato yield regulated deficit irrigation water use efficiency total soluble solids vitamin c 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l is one of the popular vegetables battilani et al 2012 as well as an important source of antioxidants such as lycopene phenolic and vitamin c in human diet toor et al 2006 the plant area of tomato was 4 8 106 ha worldwide in 2012 with an annual production 160 106 t faostat 2014 processing tomato principally provides source of significant phytonutrients such as β carotene and lycopene dorais et al 2008 the majority of tomatoes were consumed as tomato puree paste or sauce mirondo and barringer 2015 while tomato is important to ensure the security of global food traditional tomato irrigation demands a lot of water inputs due to the incremental threat of water scarcity influencing 4 billion people all over the world at present mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 it is crucial to develop water saving practices with the potential to increase water use efficiency while maintaining yields and fruit quality or reducing yields a little to support a growing population water is an increasingly rare resource and agricultural irrigation consumes a large amount of water resources which is not efficiently used water security is the basis for food security water is a key factor to yield and crop quality but water resources become rare to agriculture due to the increasing demands of household and industry bogale et al 2016 deficit irrigation is beneficial to save water it s a practice that deliberately allows crops to maintain water deficit at some degree sometimes with losing yield lightly and significantly reducing irrigation water use english and raja 1996 kirda et al 2004 cantore et al 2016 giuliani et al 2016 regulated deficit irrigation rdi has been proved to potentially save water in agriculture and it allows crops to bear mild water stress with no or only minimal decline of yield and quality costa et al 2007 many investigations studied the potential advantages of deficit irrigation in increasing water use efficiency in crop production chai et al 2016 at the present time rdi is used as a strategy of water saving many studies reported that rdi was helpful to save water and improve crop quality wang et al 2005 li et al 2013 ji et al 2015 irrigation is thought to be one of the key factors to influence plant water status many studies have indicated that deficit irrigation can enhance tomato fruit quality mitchell et al 1991 pulupol et al 1996 veit köhler et al 1999 johnstone et al 2005 favati et al 2009 patanè and cosentino 2010 wang et al 2011 patanè et al 2011 in recent years fruit quality has became a major concern for fruit production in response to the increasing demand of consumers guichard et al 2001 because of its significance to human health and pleasure it can lower the risk of developing some cancers giovannucci et al 1995 franceschi et al 1994 water deficit usually leads to decreased photosynthesis plant growth and crop productivity and beneficial effects on some fruit quality parameters for instance increased antioxidant compound levels and higher sugar accumulation ripoll et al 2016 given these benefits many efforts have been made to disseminate rdi particularly in china the definition of the influence of deficit irrigation on processing tomato fruit yield and quality are poor due to its complexity though there are lots of articles renquist and reid 2001 marouelli and silva 2007 favati et al 2009 what s more few studies patanè and cosentino 2010 quantified the effects of deficit irrigation on processing tomato at different growth stages in this regard we conducted a meta analysis with the following objectives 1 quantify the effect of rdi on processing tomato yield water use efficiency and fruit quality 2 identify soil texture growth stage and deficit severity that benefit yield and increase water use efficiency compared to full irrigation 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection a comprehensive literature search was conducted on isi web of science science direct and china national knowledge internet for articles published from april 1960 to february 2019 about tomato under deficit irrigation the literature search was conducted with a focus on the following keywords 1 tomato yield and regulated deficit irrigation 2 tomato quality and regulated deficit irrigation 3 water use efficiency and regulated deficit irrigation after preliminary collection we checked the varieties of tomato and the articles about tomato for processing were collected publications which consist of field experiments or pot experiments with contrast of rdi and the control without water deficit ck were chosen here rdi technique mainly refers to that the plant sensitivity to water stress is not continuous at stages of crops growth period costa et al 2007 in all situations experiments with rdi were included except for collecting yield data from each research we also recorded data on water use efficiency since the yield in each paper was a little different such as total yield total marketable yield and total fresh weight and so on we collected all of them as variable yield the ratio between photosynthesis and transpiration at physiological level is the definition of water use efficiency wue for agronomic evaluations zhang et al 2017 wue was calculated as i the ratio between dry above ground biomass and evapotranspiration i e biomass wue b wue and ii the ratio between marketable yield and evapotranspiration i e yield wue y wue cantore et al 2016 for this study we just collected the data of yield wue in addition to collecting the interesting response variables yield wue we also collected soil variables such as texture the general soil texture groups include three classes sandy loamy or clayey based on usda soil texture classes usda 1993 in our study loamy soil was one group and sandy and clayey soil was non loamy soil group moreover rdi timing data were also collected the rdi timing means when water deficit was applied at the different growing stage since the treatments about the time of rdi were different in each articles the rdi timing were divided into three stages 1 the first stage it begins from transplanting to first fruit setting it was abbreviated as v stage 2 the second stage it begins from first fruit setting to first fruit maturity it was abbreviated as f stage 3 the third stage it begins from first fruit maturity to uprooting crops and after all fruits are harvested it was abbreviated as r stage the rdi timing was classified into 1 water deficit happened only during one of the stage such as at the first the second or the third stage 2 water deficit occurred throughout the season and it meant water deficit last for a long time not just applied only during one of the growth stages referred above after the rigorous search and selection we identified 25 articles in the final document data bases the experiments reported on selected articles were different consisting of 561 experimental groups and 145 control groups table 1 the experimental groups stood for the rdi treatments and the control groups stood for no water deficit irrigation treatments in all articles searched all the groups were calculated including replications from the selected articles 44 0 were from asia and 24 0 from china most of the research used transplanted tomato crop water use efficiency was reported in 13 studies 387 observations 2 2 data analysis the meta analysis was performed by revman 5 0 software review manager revman is the cochrane collaboration s software for preparing and maintaining cochrane reviews revman facilitates preparation of protocols and full reviews including text characteristics of studies comparison tables and study data review manager version 5 0 2008 it can perform meta analysis of the data entered and present the results graphically for continuous variables we have used weighted mean differences wmds or standard mean difference smd for analysis for categorical variables we have applied the odds ratios ors for evaluation for binary variables we analyzed the risk ratio rr and hazard ratio hr the degree of heterogeneity which indicated variance between studies was assessed using the higgins i2 statistics and q test higgins et al 2003 the fixed effects model was performed for studies with low heterogeneity i2 50 and p 0 05 in the presence of significant heterogeneity i2 50 or p 0 05 the random effect model was used to pool the data tau2 was also presented in random effect model in this study the outcome of variables yield water use efficiency total soluble solids and vitamin c were continuous so we used wmds to do the analysis because the units of variables in most articles collected were the same we didn t use smd and excluded the data with different units the pooled results were expressed by forest plots wang et al 2017 in the forest plot ci stands for 95 confidence intervals an estimate of the effect magnitude was calculated for each study and then averaged to determine the overall effect size z index the p value following chi2 stood for the heterogeneity while the p value following z stood for statistical significance the results were significant when the p value following z was smaller than 0 05 mean difference md was the difference between two means and it stood for the effect of absolute values between multiple studies 3 results 3 1 overall impact of rdi on yield water use efficiency 3 1 1 effect of rdi on yield studies with available data on processing tomato yield were gathered together for a visual representation of the results fig 1 the effect of rdi on yield had statistical significance z 5 26 p 0 00001 there was heterogeneity between the studies i2 100 p 0 00001 in general rdi decreased yield when comparing it with the control group md 18 61 95 ci 25 54 to 11 68 3 1 2 effect of rdi on water use efficiency as shown in fig 2 rdi resulted in a significant change in water use efficiency with overall effect size z of 3 25 p 0 001 however there was heterogeneity between the studies i2 95 p 0 00001 compared with ck rdi increased water use efficiency md 2 33 95 ci 0 92 to 3 74 3 2 soil texture and management practices affecting yield in rdi with respect to soil texture we have observed impact on rdi yield rdi yield decreased compared to ck in all situations fig 3 when rdi was applied in loamy soils yield decreased more md 19 79 95 ci 26 53 to 13 06 in contrast to the experiments md 14 26 95 ci 20 21 to 8 31 when practicing in non loamy soils about water management we checked the phenological stage at which the water deficit was imposed rdi timing and its severity these studies were significantly heterogeneous i2 100 p 0 00001 under the random effects model the ck favored yield compared to rdi md 18 61 95 ci 25 54 to 11 68 when rdi was carried out during the entire season yield decreased md 21 33 95 ci 31 36 to 11 29 it also made some difference when rdi was carried out at one of the three stages md 15 24 95 ci 20 44 to 10 03 from fig 4 we found out that the effects of rdi on yield were not so different in throughout season group and not throughout season group with the purpose of a detailed study on how the rdi affected yield at different growth stages we did an analysis on yield at three different stages we collected 249 experiments from 8 articles no significant difference in yield was found at v and f stage and the md were 1 49 95 ci 4 96 to 1 99 p 0 40 and 10 42 95 ci 22 29 to 1 45 p 0 09 respectively fig 5 however rdi caused significant changes on yield at r stage the yield decreased with the overall effect size z of 3 59 p 0 00001 the md was 14 77 95 ci 22 84 to 6 71 p 0 0003 in order to find the effect of rdi severity on tomato yield we classified data into two groups if the irrigation amount was less than 50 of the control group rdi was classified as severe rdi the rest was considered as mild rdi taking the soil texture into consideration we did a subgroup analysis on the basis of the rdi severity from fig 6 we discovered that yield decreased more in loamy soil than in non loamy soil the md was 25 94 95 ci 29 40 to 22 49 in loamy soil group and the md was 16 46 95 ci 31 48 to 1 43 in non loamy soil group the result was the same as that of fig 3 the purpose of the subgroup analysis was to find whether the severe water deficit responded differently in different soil textures compared to mild water deficit 3 3 soil texture and management practices affecting water use efficiency in rdi we took 387 experiments from 13 articles for comparison of the influence of soil texture on processing tomato water use efficiency from fig 7 we concluded that the soil texture significantly affected water use efficiency under rdi the md was 2 82 95 ci 0 02 to 5 65 in loamy soil however water use efficiency significantly increased in non loamy soil with the md of 2 48 95 ci 0 51 to 4 46 the effects of the rdi timing on water use efficiency was presented in fig 8 which was calculated from 387 experiment data wue significantly increased in groups throughout the season md 2 83 95 ci 0 70 to 4 95 the data of the groups not throughout the season showed wue did not significantly increase with the md was 2 08 95 ci 0 36 to 4 52 we gathered available data on studies about how water use efficiency responded in different growth stages when rdi was carried out one hundred and fifty six data were pooled from 4 articles fig 9 showed that water use efficiency displayed no significant change at all stages except for the first stage for the values of p were 0 04 at v stage 0 78 at f stage and 0 50 at r stage the result is the same as fig 8 in which we conducted a subgroup analysis about the timing of rdi with the same purpose of finding the effect of rdi severity on tomato yield we also divided the experiments into two groups to search out the effect of rdi severity on tomato water use efficiency the overall effect size z of loamy soil texture subgroup was 1 55 p 0 12 from fig 10 the result indicated that soil texture had no significant effect on water use efficiency under severe rdi the md was 4 87 95 ci 6 89 to 16 64 and 3 15 95 ci 1 41 to 7 71 respectively 3 4 effect of rdi on tomato quality 3 4 1 effect of rdi on tomato total soluble solids eleven studies reported on the relationship between total soluble solids and rdi the data from the 292 samples showed that rdi increased total soluble solids with mean difference of 0 80 95 ci 0 49 to 1 11 in processing tomato the overall effect size was 5 13 p 0 00001 the studies had heterogeneity because of i2 of 94 fig 11 during the growth stages tomato total soluble solids responded differently to rdi from the 118 samples we concluded that conducting rdi at r stage increased more total soluble solids than that at f stage however rdi had no significant effect on total soluble solids at v stage from fig 12 we learned that the md was 0 48 95 ci 0 22 to 1 18 at v stage 1 08 95 ci 0 20 to 1 96 at f stage and 1 15 95 ci 0 57 to 1 72 at r stage respectively 3 4 2 effect of rdi on tomato vitamin c the effect of rdi on tomato vitamin c was reported by 9 heterogeneous studies i2 97 p 0 00001 fig 13 so we took a random model to do the analysis rdi associated with increase in vitamin c md 2 96 95 ci 1 36 to 4 56 p 0 0003 vitamin c increased at r stage more than at f stage fig 14 and the result was similar as the effect of rdi on total soluble solids in different stages at v stage the md was 0 07 95 ci 0 85 to 0 99 p 0 89 at f stage the md was 1 09 95 ci 0 32 to 1 87 p 0 006 at r stage the md was 2 26 95 ci 1 48 to 3 04 p 0 00001 4 discussion 4 1 rdi influencing yield water is important to the growth of tomatoes rdi applied to tomato is helpful in declining production cost and protecting water resources the application of rdi decreased tomato yield it proved that tomato is one of the crops which need large water volumes peet 2005 a lot of studies had found that deficit irrigation to a certain degree declined tomato yield zegbe domínguez et al 2003 kirda et al 2004 patanè et al 2011 though depending on the period and the degree of water stress helyes and varga 1994 nuruddin et al 2003 zegbe et al 2006 whether the soil is loamy or not the yield decreased and it decreased more in loamy soil fig 3 different soil texture may have different effect on tomato root system development thus affects yield differently the effect of soil texture on root system development had been explored in previous studies konôpka et al 2008 tracy et al 2013 de pascale et al 2015 had done experiments about the effects of irrigation and soil type on grown tomatoes if we divided the experiment data into two subgroups according to the rdi timing we found the effects of rdi on tomato yield were a little different fig 4 for a deeper study we classified the time of rdi into three stages and we could find which stage affected tomato yield more from fig 5 we concluded that there was no significant yield penalty at the first stage early rdi did not significantly affect yield since water deficit at the vegetative stage is too early to influence tomato growth which agreed with the previous studies ngouajio et al 2007 marouelli et al 2004 furthermore the data showed that processing tomato yield decreased when carrying out rdi at the third stage this conclusion demonstrated that processing tomato was sensitive to water stress at fruit ripening stage moreover the sensitivity to water stress at the three growth stages were not equal in this study the yield at the third stage significantly decreased while the yield did not significantly decreased in other two stages fig 5 the possible reason was that the third stage was a key period for tomato plants and the fruit growth stage was most responsible to improve tomato yield kirda et al 2004 nuruddin et al 2003 reported that sensitivity to water stress occurred primarily during fruit growth rather than flowering and fruit set marouelli and silva 2007 found that yield decreased when regulated deficit irrigation occurred during fruit maturation growth stages primarily because of many small green fruits aborting or not enlarging under water deficit conditions the response of tomato to deficit irrigation not only depends on the period of water deficit but also on the degree of water deficit we grouped the experiment data into two categories according to irrigation water amount the severe rdi group included treatments in which the amount of irrigation water was less than 50 of that in the treatments without water deficit and the rest was mild rdi group compared to mild rdi group severe rdi group declined tomato yield with mean difference of 22 65 t ha 1 fig 6 the figure suggested that the irrigation amount should not be less than 50 of the irrigation water in treatments without water deficit if the water deficit was severe tomato yield decreased favati et al 2009 had indicated that the yield of processing tomatoes decreased when the irrigation water was only 50 of crop evapotranspiration in a mediterranean climate condition the result was in agreement with previous study wiertz and lenz 1987 which found yield was more negatively affected by low water supply deficit irrigation treatments received 1 3 or 2 3 irrigation amount of control group at three different growth stages of tomato were set in previous study wang et al 2011 and the yields in 1 3 irrigation amount of control group treatments were all less than that in 2 3 irrigation amount of control group treatments it may indicate that the degree of water deficit could not be too severe what s more tomato yield was more sensitive in loamy soil in contrast to non loamy soil in conclusion tomato tolerance of severe deficit irrigation was stronger in non loamy soil than in loamy soil as a suggestion we would better apply severe rdi in non loamy soil if water resources are rare and it could reduce the influence of water stress on tomato yield ezzo et al 2010 studied the effect of interaction between irrigation water levels and soil types on sweet pepper and found the interaction significantly affected plant length leaves and total fresh weight and root dry weight the same results were found by abo hussein 1995 on potato el zeiny and ibrahim 2006 applied irrigation water of 80 and 100 et0 to tomato grown in clay soil and found that the capability of plants to produce the vigorous vegetative growth was inspired however there are little studies about the effect of interaction between the water deficit severity and soil textures on tomato yield maybe later studies could study this aspect 4 2 rdi influencing water use efficiency the shortage of water is one of the limits to crop production in the world though rdi made tomato yield loss water use efficiency was positively affected by water deficit as fig 2 showed in other words it saved water which agreed with the results reported by topcu et al 2007 the possibility to save irrigation water and make water use efficiency rise was proved by the experimental results by benković and rakočević 2011 with water resources becoming scarcer this is an important advantage of rdi the fact that water use efficiency increased under deficit irrigation could be owed to the stomata closure zegbe et al 2007 factually the control of stomata aperture represents a key aspect in the regulation of the wue the soil texture had significant effect on water use efficiency fig 7 moreover wue significantly increased in non loamy soil while it didn t in loamy soil water use efficiency significantly increased when the application of rdi was throughout the whole growth stage on the other hand there was no significant change in water use efficiency when application of rdi was at one of the tomato growth stage or just for a period in a detailed analysis fig 9 wue significantly increased at the first stage while it did not significantly increase at the other two stages under rdi in order to find out how water use efficiency responded to severe water deficit in different soil texture we classified the treatments into two groups in each article the treatments in which the amount of irrigation water was less than 50 of that in the control group were severe rdi group and the rest were mild rdi group the md indicated water use efficiency under severe rdi group didn t significantly change in both soils fig 10 the result was a little different from that of fig 7 and the reason may be the severity of rdi a majority of studies patanè et al 2011 chen et al 2013 had reported the increases in water use efficiency of tomato crop under rdi what s more water use efficiency acted differently to soil textures with the same level of deficit irrigation the result was proved in the studies of katerji et al 2010 and turner 2004 there are many other factors affecting the water use efficiency varietal tolerance to water stress katerji et al 2008 the sensitivity of the growth stage to stress kirda et al 1999 the climate zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 from fig 6 the result showed that yield decreased less in non loamy soil than that in loamy soil under severe rdi and from fig 10 it showed that soil texture did not have significantly effects on wue under severe rdi taking yield and wue into consideration if water is in shortage it will be better for transplanting tomato in non loamy soil under severe rdi because of the less yield loss 4 3 rdi influencing quality even though rdi had an unsatisfactory effect on tomato yield fruit quality was improved to some extent fruit yield and soluble solids displayed a negative correlation in most cases as marouelli and silva 2007 also found the benefit of rdi on fruit quality has been largely reported in studies johnstone et al 2005 patanè and cosentino 2010 from fig 11 we concluded that deficit irrigation increased total soluble solids md 0 80 95 ci 0 49 to 1 11 in tomato compared to control groups vitamin c also increased cutting water down resulted in a reduction of fruit water content and thus increased the fruit soluble solids content some studies concluded that water stress could promote vitamin c and soluble solids zegbe domínguez et al 2003 favati et al 2009 patanè and cosentino 2010 patanè et al 2011 both total soluble solids and vitamin c were increased when rdi was applied at the second and the third stage fig 12 and fig 14 but both of them increased more when rdi was applied at the last stage it is anticipated that deficit irrigation at the first stage does not affect the content of total soluble solids and vitamin c evidently because it s too early to influence them total soluble solids were enhanced under rdi at the third stage it was mainly due to a declined water accumulation in fruits and the lower dilution of fruits components without any significant change in the quantity of accumulated sugars guichard et al 1999 quite a lot of studies observed that deficit irrigation positively affected vitamin c favati et al 2009 patanè et al 2011 veit köhler et al 1999 assumed that accumulating more sugar combined with providing less water helped vitamin c synthesis in the period of fruit ripening moreover leaf area index was reduced under deficit irrigation and hence the light intensity and duration was increased which favored the accumulation of vitamin c dumas et al 2003 the reason why tomato quality improved under deficit irrigation was that tomato fruit would be the strongest sink for assimilating nutrients among the plant s organs gamareldawla et al 2017 once the tomato crop was under water deficit the plant would control some metabolic activities such as osmotic adjustment to preferentially re allocate more sucrose to the sink organs and to increase the organic acid transformation rate consequently the gradient of sucrose concentration between the leaves and fruits would increase qi et al 2003 as a result fruits assimilate more to enhance vitamin c 5 conclusions the results of this study showed that soil texture had significant effect on tomato yield under severe rdi tomato yield decreased more in loamy soil than that in non loamy soil in terms of the growth stage the reduction of processing tomato yield was obvious under rdi at the third stage compared to other stages water use efficiency significantly increased in non loamy soil while not in loamy soil the timing affected the water use efficiency when the time was classified into three stages water use efficiency under rdi significantly increased at the first stage it is beneficial to tomato if rdi was applied in non loamy soil since yield decreased less and water use efficiency increased moreover it is also beneficial to tomato if severe rdi was applied in non loamy soil the implementation of rdi can improve tomato total soluble solids and vitamin c what s more both increased more under rdi at the third stage than at previous two stages application of rdi at the first stage is recommended because yield does not significantly decrease and water use efficiency significantly increases although application of rdi at the third stage could improve fruit quality it decreased fruit yield the application of rdi under severe conditions needs more study to balance the yield loss and the increase of water use efficiency acknowledgement the research was supported by key program granted by the national nature

10968,soil physical and chemical properties can be amended by application of organic residues such as spent coffee grounds scg in this work we examined scg effects on the modification of some soil physical hydraulic properties such as soil water retention and aeration investigating beneficial uses for this waste product soil properties were evaluated using pots filled with a mixture of a sandy loam soil with the contents of 0 5 10 15 and 20 of scg the most relevant soil properties to the purposes were the moisture at container capacity θcc readily available water capacity rawc and drainable porosity ϕd additionally under the hypothesis that scg can be used as soil conditioner lettuce crop cultivar mimosa roxa roxanne was transplanted to the pots where the leaf area index and the cumulative biomass throughout the growing cycle were examined comparing to the absence of scg 0 soil scg contents of 5 10 15 and 20 presented larger values of θcc and consequently larger rawc and smaller ϕd although the increase of soil water storage from 43 2 0 to 53 3 20 mm crop development was prejudiced by the reduction on ϕd from 0 1595 0 to 0 0827 20 m3 m 3 which affected soil aeration this greater water availability obtained with the increase of θcc was promoted by the residue addition pointing out for a possible use of scg to increase water retention for other crops abbreviations

livestock and supply 2017 such scenario promotes a huge production on spent coffee grounds scg generated either by manufacturing soluble coffee or homemade and commercial consuming creating a residue without many established perspectives of reuse except incineration mata et al 2018 scg is generally constituted by small particles 20 μm of an organic material composed by fibers 50 and complex lignin structures with high specific surface area 7500 m2 kg 1 kim et al 2014 because of these physical properties small particle size and high specific surface area the use of scg arises as a viable alternative to help water management in soils with low cohesion as acidic soils which are more susceptible to erosion kasongo et al 2013 in arid or semiarid regions where water is a scarce resource or its availability to the concerning crop is scanty some practices can be used to improve water retention and therefore help in water management also in areas with occurrence of sandy soils or those with large particles aggregation and hydraulic conductivity the small specific surface area associated with other properties leads to adsorption of less water therefore the use of soil conditioners which are products from mineral industrial or organic origin e g plaster synthetic polymers tree pruning waste and sewage sludge is an option to decrease the surface evaporation and water percolation moraes et al 2001 these materials provide water absorption and increases retention capacity by thus modifying the soil physical hydraulic properties throughout soil depth as infiltration and water storage improving its availability to plants reynolds et al 2003 vale et al 2006 the quantification of soil available water storage can be performed based on the moisture at field capacity θfc cong et al 2014 turek et al 2018 or in case of artificially constructed environments on pot or container capacity θcc shimshi 1963 field capacity fc can be conceptualized as the amount of water held in the soil after excess gravitational water has drained away and after the rate of downward movement of water has materially decreased which usually takes place within 2 or 3 days in pervious soils of uniform structure and texture veihmeyer and hendrickson 1931 fc determination either in situ or in containers is performed with an internal drainage experiment where soil moisture is raised until saturation allowing free drainage afterwards until the flux becomes negligible romano and santini 2002 the considerable difference between θfc and θcc is due to sieved soil accommodation in containers which has no horizons and lower height than the soil profile moreover the atmospheric pressure potential acts on the bore base of containers being responsible for the quick drainage on the porous media to reach θcc casaroli and de jong van lier 2008 lettuce is one of the most yielded and consumed vegetable in brazil embrapa and sebrae 2010 and presents high hydric demand nunes et al 2009 generating the need of many farmers investing on irrigation systems usually sprinkler irrigation type these systems could have benefit with the addition of some soil conditioner since the increase of water storage depth might decrease the frequency of irrigation moreover in rainfed systems the rainwater availability to plants in some soils is also enlarged by increasing θfc or θcc extending thus the period without need of water supply scg addition into soils to improve the growing of lettuce plants has been evaluated in terms of physicochemical soil properties and biological plant properties gomes et al 2013 investigated the use of composted and fresh scg in the growing of lettuce lactuca sativa l looking for a content between 2 5 and 20 for fresh scg which would provide the maximum plant growth they found that both composted and uncomposted residues provide benefits to lettuce growing however some nutrients foliar n p and k were reduced by the residue application cruz et al 2012 evaluated concentrations of scg between 0 and 20 on carotenoid and chlorophyll content in lettuce lactuca sativa l var capitata the authors addressed increase of all pigments according to the increase on scg content however a reduction on organic nitrogen proportional to increase on scg content was also noticed pointing to possible induced stress cervera mata et al 2017 analyzed the use of scg contents from 0 to 10 as soil amendment in two clayey mediterranean agricultural soils also evaluating the effect on the growth of lettuce lactuca sativa l one of the soils presented increase in available water with larger scg content whereas in the other it decreased also the limitation to lettuce growth with the highest concentration of 10 of scg was identified cruz et al 2014 examined the antioxidant activity and individual bioactive compounds of lettuce cultivated with 2 5 30 of fresh and composted scg for fresh compounds a progressive increment on antioxidant capacity with the increment of scg contents was observed all these studies point for the potential use of scg for soil amendment however they lack on the information regarding the effect of scg in the hydraulic properties of the soil and how it can also affect the plant growth the objective in this work was to exam the effect of scg on some physical soil properties assessing how it modifies some soil hydraulic properties related to water retention and drainable porosity aiming for an alternative destination to this large generated biowaste furthermore under the hypothesis that scg may be used as a soil conditioner in a sandy loam soil the development and cumulative biomass of lettuce on an artificial porous medium with the characteristics of this soil were examined 2 material and methods 2 1 soil and site description the analyses were carried out at agricultural science sector sca from federal university of paraná ufpr located at curitiba pr brazil in order to evaluate the conditioner effect of the spent coffee grounds scg on hydraulic properties of a sandy soil 75 kg of soil were collected in a site located near to lapa city pr 25 43 13 5 s 49 42 7 5 w the disturbed material was collected at the top soil in the layer 0 0 3 m depth putting away the vegetal covering at the surface the soil is classified as an entisol soil survey staff 1999 not plastic not sticky with color 10yr 2 2 the geological formation of the sampled site is from itararé group being at 900 m of altitude with flat undulating relief fig 1 the textural analysis was carried out based on the bouyoucos hydrometer method gee and or 2002 obtaining the contents of 0 745 kg kg 1 of sand 0 105 kg kg 1 of silt and 0 15 kg kg 1 of clay thus according to the soil textural triangle recommended by the u s departament of agriculture usda the textural class of the used soil was identified as sandy loam soil survey staff 1999 2 2 adding the spent coffee grounds into the soil the collected soil was let to be air dried and then sieved through a 4 mm mesh then ph and nutrient analyses were carried out for soil chemical characterization in laboratory soil ph was determined using a solution of cacl2 0 01 mol dm 3 the potential acidity h al was obtained from smp with a phmeter the exchangeable cations of aluminum al3 were determined using a titration with bromothymol blue calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 were determined in an atomic absorption spectrometry by extraction using a kcl 1 mol dm 3 solution potassium k was determined with mehlich 1 extractive solution analyzed in flame spectrophotometer whereas phosphorus p was determined with the same extractive solution but in a spectrophotometer at 660 nm the organic carbon c content was measured using a cold digestion of na2cr2o7 with a spectrophotometer at 650 nm table 1 based on this soil chemical characterization ph and chemical fertility correction were carried out according to the guidelines to lettuce growth of the manual of fertilization and liming recommended to the states of rio grande do sul and santa catarina commission of soil chemistry and fertility rs sc 2004 thereby 0 177 kg of calcareous dolomite were incubated into 58 kg of soil during 40 days in order to obtain a blend with ph 6 0 this mineral was homogenized into small amounts of soil and then scrambled to the remaining soil with adequate mixing in order to increase the incubation efficiency water was added to soil fractions at every 5 days revolving them to keep soil wet and homogeneous after those 40 days the soil was oven dried at 60 c for 4 days soil fertility was adjusted by adding 100 mg dm 3 of p2o5 and 60 mg dm 3 of k2o since phosphorus content was considered small and potassium content was considered large based on soil carbon content the added amount of nitrogen to soil was 50 mg dm 3 the spent coffee grounds scg were obtained from a cafeteria and air dried before mixing to the soil in other to create the material that compound the studied porous medium thus scg amounts were added into the soil with the gravimetric contents of 0 without scg 5 10 15 and 20 table 2 2 3 experiment design the experiment was carried out using containers pots with dimension of 0 16 m height and total volume of 2 dm3 the soil material with 5 different scg contents treatments was inserted into these pots in a completely randomized design with 4 replicates to every treatment all pots were filled with 2 088 kg of dried material until the fullness of 1 74 dm3 reaching the bulk density ρb of 1 2 kg dm 3 equal to every container total porosity ϕ was calculated based on this information and solid particle density attaining ϕ 0 5472 m3 m 3 the values of ρb and ϕ were imposed on all treatments in order to maintain a standard porous medium thus diminishing the possible coefficient of variation cv among all pots although scg participation on particle composition becomes more expressive in the mass of 2 088 kg from 0 to 20 of residue the granulometric composition in the 4 replicates were kept constant minimizing the variance in the material arrangement for every analyzed scg content furthermore after uniformly accommodated in pots the material was submitted to wetting and drying cycles turning the arrangement even more uniform pot holes on the base were covered with geotextile cloth to avoid losing solid particles due to the water drainage lastly pots were saturated by capillary rise allowing free drainage afterwards monitoring the material moisture three times a day at 8 00 am 12 00 and 6 00 pm over three consecutive days during this period soil surface was covered to minimize evaporation effects 2 4 the analyzed soil hydraulic properties soil hydraulic properties as water content at container capacity θcc readily available water capacity rawc and drainable porosity range ϕd were analyzed to evaluate the effect of coffee sludge on soil hydraulic behavior pulling out the mass of every pot geotextile cloth arrangement the gravimetric material water content θg was monitored determining also the volumetric material water content θ using the following equation 1 θ θg ρb ρw in which θ is the volumetric water content m3 m 3 θg is the gravimetric water content kg kg 1 ρb is the bulk density kg m 3 and ρw is the specific mass of water 1000 kg m 3 the mean data of θ derived from 4 replicates varying over the time were fitted using non linear regression to obtain the values of water content at container capacity θcc the corresponding mean time tcc in which the function θ t reaches θcc was determined considering that the derivative of θ t generated from mean values of every scg content is null related to time when the minimum point from regressed function is attained dθ t dt 0 the mean θcc for every analyzed scg content was then determined by replacing tcc into the generated non linear regressions the parameter θr from van genuchten 1980 mualem model used to describe the soil water retention curve swrc was estimated by the first pedotransfer function from splintex 1 0 prevedello and loyola 2002 silva et al 2017 reis et al 2018 this function requires the sand silt and clay contents bulk and particle density to provide the values of swrc parameters because of the sandy texture of the studied soil the result of θr 0 0860 m3 m 3 was set to the permanent wilting point θpwp based on the results of θcc and θpwp the readily available water capacity rawc was calculated as the second evaluated hydraulic property by means of 2 rawc θcc θpwp p z in which rawc is the readily available water capacity mm θcc is the water content at container capacity m3 m 3 θpwp is the permanent wilting point m3 m 3 z is the root zone depth mm and p is the average fraction of available water that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress occurs by evapotranspiration reduction 0 1 in this work we used z for lettuce equal to 50 mm factor of water depletion p of 0 42 according to allen et al 1998 and θcc as the major value obtained from all evaluated scenarios to find the factor p of 0 42 we used the crop evapotranspiration etc calculated by the product of reference evapotranspiration et0 3 mm d 1 and the crop coefficient kc 1 recommended by fao allen et al 1998 the value of et0 was chosen accordingly to agronomic institute of paraná iapar 2017 to curitiba region during the period of the experiment thereby rawc was calculated as 9 11 mm which is equivalent to 160 ml of water by pot for every day of irrigation based on the values of etc and rawc the period of irrigation was estimated as 3 days in the initial strategy of irrigation schedule the third soil examined hydraulic property was the drainable porosity range ϕd which was analyzed under the effect of coffee sludge calculated by 3 ϕd ϕ θcc in which ϕ and ϕd are respectively total porosity and drainable porosity range m3 m 3 and θcc is the water content at container capacity m3 m 3 2 5 effects of spent coffee grounds on crop development aiming to examine whether the addition of scg as soil conditioner would affect the crop development on the studied soil or not the growing of lettuce seedlings of the crop mimosa roxa roxanne were monitored the prepared pots were moved to a greenhouse where the seedlings of lettuce were transplanted into them 32 days after sowing the irrigation practice at the first week started right after the plants transplanting and applied every 3 days as planned before irrigation period was then increased to 4 days after 7 days to 5 days after 14 days and to 6 days in the fourth week after transplanting diminishing the frequency of water supply 28 days after transplanting in order to monitor the behavior of the crop without water supply the last irrigation volume was decreased to 80 ml half the rawc and then finally ceased this last stage was the only one without water supply to the plants the development of lettuce plants was monitored by means of the leaf area index lai and the final wet and dry mass lai was determined by superficial images of every pot after the transplanting process taking pictures at the same hour every 2 days the camera was propped into a holder to ensure the same euclidean height 90 and consequently the same scale for all images reaching more accuracy on lai measures the images were then analyzed in a computer aided design software fig 2 to perform this analysis the crop growth development was divided into 4 phases phase i was from beginning until the 6th day after transplanting phase ii comprehended 7th to 14th day phase iii from 15th to 22th day and phase iv from 23th to 30th day the method of measuring areas by computer aided design software is precise and used in several fields such as in hydrology or mechanical engineering when the determination of perimeter and areas of watershed and small mechanical parts are need inasmuch as the lettuce leaves are curved this standardized method allowed us to determine the evolution of the growing cycle and recognize the patterns of improving decreasing development of the plant in actual experimental conditions which are the interest of the study lettuce plants were monitored throughout the entire growing cycle under irrigation plants were removed from the pots when lai decreased for more than 3 consecutive days the period between the ceasing on irrigation and the removal was defined as the lettuce survival time after this removal the wet mass of the plants was measured for every replicate and scg content then plants were oven dried at 60 c for 3 days for dry mass determination for posteriori statistical analysis of lai wet and dry mass 2 6 soil aeration the minimum required space or minimum drainable porosity ϕd min to allow oxygen diffusion can be estimated by a zero order oxygen consumption function ben noah and friedman 2018 boundary conditions for representing the oxygen concentration at the upper layer as an initial value χ0 and the zero downward flux at the bottom layer should be assumed for solving this function moreover the concentration at this point is zero for representing the total oxygen deficit at the bottom as described in prevedello and armindo 2015 from the diffusion equation in non transient condition this relationship can be written in a soil profile by 4 ϕd min l2φo2 2dχ0 in which ϕd min m3 m 3 is the minimum drainable porosity to favor soil aeration l m is the profile length φo2 kg m 3 s 1 is the respiration rate d m2 s 1 is soil diffusion coefficient and χ0 kg m 3 is the oxygen concentration at soil surface 2 7 statistical analysis all measurements were taken in 4 replicates and then the mean values were used to represent them the values of ρb and ϕ were imposed in all treatments in order to maintain a standardized porous media thus diminishing the coefficient of variation cv among all pots to evaluate the differences between treatments analysis of variance anova combined with tukey test setting significance level at 0 05 were used to compare the mean results 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil hydraulic properties modification the time to soil to reach container capacity tcc and their respective θcc value was determined based on regressions of the mean monitored values of the soil water content θ after free drainage in the pots the results from fitting non linear regressions to every treatment using mean values of θ are presented in fig 3 statistically significant differences were noticed in θcc among the evaluated contents of the soil conditioner confirming the effect of scg on water retention table 3 according to warrick and nielsen s 1980 criterion the coefficient of variation cv values can be considered small because they revealed values less than 12 for θcc among the four replicates this means that every assessed scg concentration shows uniformity in its four replicates the highest result for θcc was observed under the content of 15 of scg which generated consequently the lowest ϕd however there were not significant differences among t10 t15 and t20 casaroli and de jong van lier 2008 discuss that θcc is influenced by soil structure texture bulk density and organic matter content oc thus the addition of a material that promotes changes in oc may alter in some level the values of θcc result that was observed in this experiment with scg kasongo et al 2011 reported that many studies have been carried out about the use of organic waste as agents to improve physicochemical properties in soil with low oc content the authors verified that a mixture of coffee pulp and coffee husk added to a sandy soil has decreased the percolation and improved the water retention in levels of 55 60 regardless the mixture content this result corroborates to the ones in this work where an increase of 31 was observed between the treatments t1 and t15 according to the same authors that change in water retention is related to changes in soil structure due to oc increase the fitted regression based on results of θcc as a function of scg content is presented in fig 4 since this fitted cubic polynomial is valid only to the domain between 0 and 20 of scg in a sandy loam soil it is not applicable to estimate the behavior of values that are not within this range the results of θcc have increased from t0 0 vs 0 396 m3 m 3 until the critical maximum local point 15 07 vs 0 5197 m3 m 3 found out settling the first derivative of the cubic polynomial equal to zero from this point the regression line becomes descending the increasement in θcc until 15 of scg is related to the arrangement of the porous media obtained from the sandy loam soil with the addition of the soil conditioner the reason for the decreasing after 15 is associated with the geometry of pores which was molded with scg addition modifying their shape tortuosity continuity and conductivity this structure of pores can be further investigated using more specific techniques such as micromorphology by the images of tomography or microscopy analysis cruz et al 2014 assessed the antioxidant activity and individual bioactive of some lettuce compounds cultivated with the addition of scg contents from 2 5 to 30 into the soil the results of carotenoids chlorophylls and tocochromanols showed the same behaviour as found for θcc in this work they increased from 0 until 15 of scg and then decreased for 20 of scg thus it seems to have some relationship between this difference on water retention capacity and the development of the plants and its compounds caused by the addition of scg kondamudi et al 2008 evaluated the particle of scg from a cafeteria in nevada eua measuring an approximate diameter of 0 02 mm which is within the range of silt particle size 0 002 0 05 mm and kim et al 2014 commented that specific surface area for grains with this size is about 7500 m2 kg 1 the standard procedures of grinding and toasting coffee vary around the world however there is usually a coarse grind and a medium toast in countries where the high quality coffee is consumed on the other hand the toast in brazil is usually stronger whereas grind is fine so the specific surface area could be even larger than 7500 m2 kg 1 combining this wide value with other particle surface properties might contribute to enhance water retention due to the influence on adhesion adsorption and surface tension at the solid liquid interface prevedello and armindo 2015 therefore scg particles could play the role as silt particles or even as clay depending on the grinding being responsible for an improvement on water retention inferred by θcc the results of rawc table 3 are based on the hypothesis that this material does not alter the mineral composition of the soil by thus the retention in low potentials are not affected by its addition inasmuch as θpwp is mostly dependent on texture for this sandy loam soil cervera mata et al 2017 reported that the addition of scg contents of 2 5 and 10 increased the value of θfc on two mediterranean soils the same increasement behavior observed in this study these authors also evaluated θpwp addressing both decrease and increase in water retention for two different soils however in contrast with this study these two soils were clayey and the behavior of the dry range of the swrc is more affected by the addition of the residue than it is expected in the sandy loam soil all replicates without scg content have presented results of ϕd substantially larger than 0 12 m3 m 3 table 3 meanwhile the other containers have shown results smaller than this critical value although ϕd between 15 and 20 of scg contents did not reduce the value of 0 083 m3 m 3 is still bellow the limiting range of 0 10 0 12 m3 m 3 suggested to most agricultural crops jury et al 1991 prevedello and armindo 2015 reynolds et al 2009 according to these authors this minimum value is needed to occur the process of o2 difusion between the atmosphere and the porous media allowing o2 availability in enough amount to root development therefore even with the improvement on water retention by the increase on θcc and consequently on rawc the development of plants can be considerably impaired when retention and aeration are not balanced negatively affecting soil physical fertility as important as adequate water content the available air space in soil pores has direct influence on the availability of o2 to propitiate gas flux for aerobic activities of roots and microorganisms de jong van lier 2018 the expected o2 consumption rate in the pot was modelled with the measures of ϕd whereas ϕd min was obtained using the soil respiration rate φo2 measured by cervera mata et al 2017 for different scg contents profiles of o2 consumption rate are presented in fig 5 a considering that ϕd is constant throughout the whole soil section the differences on maximum φo2 between scg contents were only expressive in the thin layer from 0 to 0 01 m and reached the magnitude of 10 6 to 10 8 kg m 3 s 1 at the bottom of the pot it indicates that despite the larger available space in treatment t0 from the point of view of oxygen availability this difference matters only in the superficial layer the expected ϕd min for high and low o2 consumption rate based on measures of dommergues and mangenot 1970 in soils without scg and its comparison with the soil respiration rate measured by cervera mata et al 2017 in a soil with 2 5 and 10 of scg are presented in fig 5b results for respiration rate of about 10 8 are reported by dommergues and mangenot 1970 which are represented by means of ϕd min in fig 6 b as high and low consumption considering the order of 10 8 for φo2 measured ϕd was sufficient to allow high respiration rates even at the bottom of the pot and regardless the scg content reaching the minimum value of 8 2 10 8 for 15 of scg at 0 16 m of soil depth however the addition of scg increases the oxygen consumption in soils even without crop cultivation due to the increase on biological activity cervera mata et al 2017 thus while a ϕd min of about 0 05 m3 m 3 at the bottom for the treatment without scg is sufficient to ensure aerobic conditions this value overtake 0 40 m3 m 3 when 10 of scg is added those results indicates that the aerobic conditions could be compromised by the addition of scg so the gain by increasing θcc should be evaluated to not cause impact on ϕd and hence on aeration the lack of significant difference on the properties θcc and ϕd between the treatments t10 and t20 table 3 suggest that new experiments should be accomplished including more subdivisions on scg contents between 0 and 10 of scg contents for this soil 3 2 crop development according to results lettuce plants presented more leaf area index lai without scg addition than with the conditioner fig 6 to other treatments the highest lai was reached at t5 in the end of phase iv however without significant difference table 4 the pair ϕd 0 159 m3 m 3 vs θcc 0 388 m3 m 3 from t0 provided the greatest development of this cultivar 6 45 g and lai 0 7846 the poorest development presented from t5 to t20 can be associated with the reduction on ϕd which occurred with the increase of θcc compared to t0 table 3 corroborating with the reported limitations derived from addition of scg on crop development cervera mata et al 2017 hardgrove and livesley 2016 the increase on θcc affected lettuce development due to low ϕd levels which can directly affect soil aeration providing insufficient space to o2 diffusion jury et al 1991 kim et al 2016 studying scg application on dredged soils found out that fine scg particles prevented o2 permeability by covering soil surface showing up as an inhibiting plant growth factor thereby large results of θcc or even θfc can be adverse to irrigated systems when the critical value of ϕd for the specific crop is not considered significant differences were not observed on lai for phase i demonstrating that results of θcc and ϕd were suitable for all treatments whereas on the next phases the differences on lai wet and dry mass were obvious table 4 all restricted when ϕd was smaller than 0 12 m3 m 3 on the other phases even without significant difference the higher values of lai between t5 and t20 were observed when θcc varied from 0 42 to 0 49 m3 m 3 and ϕd from 0 06 to 0 12 m3 m 3 indeed there was a ϕd decrease with scg addition the lower lettuce yield according to scg addition can be associated with a combination of physical and chemical fertility influence and this effect can be visually observed on fig 7 despite that it was noticed a significant increase on water retention from t0 to t10 suggesting that this study could be performed using other crops lettuce surviving after ceased irrigation was different according to scg addition since scg has influenced the rawc and lai after the last water supply plants from t10 and t20 stayed without decrease on lai for 21 days whereas on t0 this occurred for only 8 days the larger results of rawc caused by the conditioner addition as well as the higher hydric demand in t0 due to evapotranspiration corroborates with that result 3 3 perspectives and considerations for spent coffee grounds as soil conditioner aiming mainly to evaluate the scg effects as conditioner to alter the soil physical hydraulic properties by promoting adequate discard to this waste material in the cheapest and easiest way its chemical correction was not performed after added into the soil therefore even in small contents scg could have negatively influenced the lettuce development as verified by hardgrove and livesley 2016 to the crops broccoli leek radish viola and sunflower it was also observed by cervera mata et al 2017 that lettuce development was suppress by scg addition although this residue has collaborated to change the electrical conductivity and the ratio between carbon and nitrogen this suppression also observed in this work should be better explained because even a small scg amount in t5 0 1044 kg table 2 was sufficient to significant decrease lai and biomass production these decreases were not significantly different on the other assessed contents table 4 indicating among other non studied factors the aeration deficit influence future studies should evaluate whether the chemical correction of soil after addition of scg is a suitable practice or not by analyzing its chemical effect on crop production the induction of hydric stress with less frequent irrigation depths larger than 6 days should be also evaluated additionally studies in less thickened soils to promote greater porosity with more scg contents between 0 and 10 to promote the increase of θcc without compromise ϕd could show peculiarities that was not entirely revealed with our experimental design this work corroborates with the need of research on the use of this residue currently with no costs as a conditioner to improve the physical fertility in soils with small water retention including pots with ornamental cultivation potential despite the lettuce development was spoiled by soil aeration on this work scg addition indeed promoted soil hydraulic properties changes this effect can positively benefit other porous medium and crops being therefore better explored in further studies since scg application has been reported to enable the development of arboreal trees in dredged soils kim et al 2016 and increases dry matter production in sandy soils in the humid tropics kasongo et al 2013 its application in soils with low retention capacity only on crop lines or in pits to tree species with large planting spacing should be evaluated to better reclamation of local rainfall or irrigation water in arid and semiarid regions 4 conclusions in this study the application of scg as soil conditioner was investigated together with its influence on lettuce growth changes on soil hydraulic properties were observed such as water retention and aeration evidencing scg as a potential conditioner to soils with poor retention capacity water content at container capacity increased from 0 to 15 of scg and decreased from 15 to 20 although 7 of increase on θcc from 10 to 15 of scg this gain was not significant suggesting that the application of scg contents larger than 10 for sandy loam soils should not be done high contents of scg spoiled the development of lettuce crop causing significantly decrease on leaf area index lai and cumulative mass indicating the excessive application the highest results for mass and lai were observed when drainable porosity overcame 0 118 m3 m 3 in the pot without scg since it was not induced hydric stress in any scg content plants cultivated under the contents of 10 and 15 survived through 21 days after the last irrigation due to a combination of less lai implying less evapotranspiration and larger rawc the application of this study in other soils and plants remains open enabling as an alternative destination to this organic waste yielded by coffee brews preparation 
10968,soil physical and chemical properties can be amended by application of organic residues such as spent coffee grounds scg in this work we examined scg effects on the modification of some soil physical hydraulic properties such as soil water retention and aeration investigating beneficial uses for this waste product soil properties were evaluated using pots filled with a mixture of a sandy loam soil with the contents of 0 5 10 15 and 20 of scg the most relevant soil properties to the purposes were the moisture at container capacity θcc readily available water capacity rawc and drainable porosity ϕd additionally under the hypothesis that scg can be used as soil conditioner lettuce crop cultivar mimosa roxa roxanne was transplanted to the pots where the leaf area index and the cumulative biomass throughout the growing cycle were examined comparing to the absence of scg 0 soil scg contents of 5 10 15 and 20 presented larger values of θcc and consequently larger rawc and smaller ϕd although the increase of soil water storage from 43 2 0 to 53 3 20 mm crop development was prejudiced by the reduction on ϕd from 0 1595 0 to 0 0827 20 m3 m 3 which affected soil aeration this greater water availability obtained with the increase of θcc was promoted by the residue addition pointing out for a possible use of scg to increase water retention for other crops abbreviations

leaf area index 1 introduction besides being currently the world major coffee producer and exporter brazil is also the second major consumer of this product according to ministry of agriculture livestock and supply 2017 such scenario promotes a huge production on spent coffee grounds scg generated either by manufacturing soluble coffee or homemade and commercial consuming creating a residue without many established perspectives of reuse except incineration mata et al 2018 scg is generally constituted by small particles 20 μm of an organic material composed by fibers 50 and complex lignin structures with high specific surface area 7500 m2 kg 1 kim et al 2014 because of these physical properties small particle size and high specific surface area the use of scg arises as a viable alternative to help water management in soils with low cohesion as acidic soils which are more susceptible to erosion kasongo et al 2013 in arid or semiarid regions where water is a scarce resource or its availability to the concerning crop is scanty some practices can be used to improve water retention and therefore help in water management also in areas with occurrence of sandy soils or those with large particles aggregation and hydraulic conductivity the small specific surface area associated with other properties leads to adsorption of less water therefore the use of soil conditioners which are products from mineral industrial or organic origin e g plaster synthetic polymers tree pruning waste and sewage sludge is an option to decrease the surface evaporation and water percolation moraes et al 2001 these materials provide water absorption and increases retention capacity by thus modifying the soil physical hydraulic properties throughout soil depth as infiltration and water storage improving its availability to plants reynolds et al 2003 vale et al 2006 the quantification of soil available water storage can be performed based on the moisture at field capacity θfc cong et al 2014 turek et al 2018 or in case of artificially constructed environments on pot or container capacity θcc shimshi 1963 field capacity fc can be conceptualized as the amount of water held in the soil after excess gravitational water has drained away and after the rate of downward movement of water has materially decreased which usually takes place within 2 or 3 days in pervious soils of uniform structure and texture veihmeyer and hendrickson 1931 fc determination either in situ or in containers is performed with an internal drainage experiment where soil moisture is raised until saturation allowing free drainage afterwards until the flux becomes negligible romano and santini 2002 the considerable difference between θfc and θcc is due to sieved soil accommodation in containers which has no horizons and lower height than the soil profile moreover the atmospheric pressure potential acts on the bore base of containers being responsible for the quick drainage on the porous media to reach θcc casaroli and de jong van lier 2008 lettuce is one of the most yielded and consumed vegetable in brazil embrapa and sebrae 2010 and presents high hydric demand nunes et al 2009 generating the need of many farmers investing on irrigation systems usually sprinkler irrigation type these systems could have benefit with the addition of some soil conditioner since the increase of water storage depth might decrease the frequency of irrigation moreover in rainfed systems the rainwater availability to plants in some soils is also enlarged by increasing θfc or θcc extending thus the period without need of water supply scg addition into soils to improve the growing of lettuce plants has been evaluated in terms of physicochemical soil properties and biological plant properties gomes et al 2013 investigated the use of composted and fresh scg in the growing of lettuce lactuca sativa l looking for a content between 2 5 and 20 for fresh scg which would provide the maximum plant growth they found that both composted and uncomposted residues provide benefits to lettuce growing however some nutrients foliar n p and k were reduced by the residue application cruz et al 2012 evaluated concentrations of scg between 0 and 20 on carotenoid and chlorophyll content in lettuce lactuca sativa l var capitata the authors addressed increase of all pigments according to the increase on scg content however a reduction on organic nitrogen proportional to increase on scg content was also noticed pointing to possible induced stress cervera mata et al 2017 analyzed the use of scg contents from 0 to 10 as soil amendment in two clayey mediterranean agricultural soils also evaluating the effect on the growth of lettuce lactuca sativa l one of the soils presented increase in available water with larger scg content whereas in the other it decreased also the limitation to lettuce growth with the highest concentration of 10 of scg was identified cruz et al 2014 examined the antioxidant activity and individual bioactive compounds of lettuce cultivated with 2 5 30 of fresh and composted scg for fresh compounds a progressive increment on antioxidant capacity with the increment of scg contents was observed all these studies point for the potential use of scg for soil amendment however they lack on the information regarding the effect of scg in the hydraulic properties of the soil and how it can also affect the plant growth the objective in this work was to exam the effect of scg on some physical soil properties assessing how it modifies some soil hydraulic properties related to water retention and drainable porosity aiming for an alternative destination to this large generated biowaste furthermore under the hypothesis that scg may be used as a soil conditioner in a sandy loam soil the development and cumulative biomass of lettuce on an artificial porous medium with the characteristics of this soil were examined 2 material and methods 2 1 soil and site description the analyses were carried out at agricultural science sector sca from federal university of paraná ufpr located at curitiba pr brazil in order to evaluate the conditioner effect of the spent coffee grounds scg on hydraulic properties of a sandy soil 75 kg of soil were collected in a site located near to lapa city pr 25 43 13 5 s 49 42 7 5 w the disturbed material was collected at the top soil in the layer 0 0 3 m depth putting away the vegetal covering at the surface the soil is classified as an entisol soil survey staff 1999 not plastic not sticky with color 10yr 2 2 the geological formation of the sampled site is from itararé group being at 900 m of altitude with flat undulating relief fig 1 the textural analysis was carried out based on the bouyoucos hydrometer method gee and or 2002 obtaining the contents of 0 745 kg kg 1 of sand 0 105 kg kg 1 of silt and 0 15 kg kg 1 of clay thus according to the soil textural triangle recommended by the u s departament of agriculture usda the textural class of the used soil was identified as sandy loam soil survey staff 1999 2 2 adding the spent coffee grounds into the soil the collected soil was let to be air dried and then sieved through a 4 mm mesh then ph and nutrient analyses were carried out for soil chemical characterization in laboratory soil ph was determined using a solution of cacl2 0 01 mol dm 3 the potential acidity h al was obtained from smp with a phmeter the exchangeable cations of aluminum al3 were determined using a titration with bromothymol blue calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 were determined in an atomic absorption spectrometry by extraction using a kcl 1 mol dm 3 solution potassium k was determined with mehlich 1 extractive solution analyzed in flame spectrophotometer whereas phosphorus p was determined with the same extractive solution but in a spectrophotometer at 660 nm the organic carbon c content was measured using a cold digestion of na2cr2o7 with a spectrophotometer at 650 nm table 1 based on this soil chemical characterization ph and chemical fertility correction were carried out according to the guidelines to lettuce growth of the manual of fertilization and liming recommended to the states of rio grande do sul and santa catarina commission of soil chemistry and fertility rs sc 2004 thereby 0 177 kg of calcareous dolomite were incubated into 58 kg of soil during 40 days in order to obtain a blend with ph 6 0 this mineral was homogenized into small amounts of soil and then scrambled to the remaining soil with adequate mixing in order to increase the incubation efficiency water was added to soil fractions at every 5 days revolving them to keep soil wet and homogeneous after those 40 days the soil was oven dried at 60 c for 4 days soil fertility was adjusted by adding 100 mg dm 3 of p2o5 and 60 mg dm 3 of k2o since phosphorus content was considered small and potassium content was considered large based on soil carbon content the added amount of nitrogen to soil was 50 mg dm 3 the spent coffee grounds scg were obtained from a cafeteria and air dried before mixing to the soil in other to create the material that compound the studied porous medium thus scg amounts were added into the soil with the gravimetric contents of 0 without scg 5 10 15 and 20 table 2 2 3 experiment design the experiment was carried out using containers pots with dimension of 0 16 m height and total volume of 2 dm3 the soil material with 5 different scg contents treatments was inserted into these pots in a completely randomized design with 4 replicates to every treatment all pots were filled with 2 088 kg of dried material until the fullness of 1 74 dm3 reaching the bulk density ρb of 1 2 kg dm 3 equal to every container total porosity ϕ was calculated based on this information and solid particle density attaining ϕ 0 5472 m3 m 3 the values of ρb and ϕ were imposed on all treatments in order to maintain a standard porous medium thus diminishing the possible coefficient of variation cv among all pots although scg participation on particle composition becomes more expressive in the mass of 2 088 kg from 0 to 20 of residue the granulometric composition in the 4 replicates were kept constant minimizing the variance in the material arrangement for every analyzed scg content furthermore after uniformly accommodated in pots the material was submitted to wetting and drying cycles turning the arrangement even more uniform pot holes on the base were covered with geotextile cloth to avoid losing solid particles due to the water drainage lastly pots were saturated by capillary rise allowing free drainage afterwards monitoring the material moisture three times a day at 8 00 am 12 00 and 6 00 pm over three consecutive days during this period soil surface was covered to minimize evaporation effects 2 4 the analyzed soil hydraulic properties soil hydraulic properties as water content at container capacity θcc readily available water capacity rawc and drainable porosity range ϕd were analyzed to evaluate the effect of coffee sludge on soil hydraulic behavior pulling out the mass of every pot geotextile cloth arrangement the gravimetric material water content θg was monitored determining also the volumetric material water content θ using the following equation 1 θ θg ρb ρw in which θ is the volumetric water content m3 m 3 θg is the gravimetric water content kg kg 1 ρb is the bulk density kg m 3 and ρw is the specific mass of water 1000 kg m 3 the mean data of θ derived from 4 replicates varying over the time were fitted using non linear regression to obtain the values of water content at container capacity θcc the corresponding mean time tcc in which the function θ t reaches θcc was determined considering that the derivative of θ t generated from mean values of every scg content is null related to time when the minimum point from regressed function is attained dθ t dt 0 the mean θcc for every analyzed scg content was then determined by replacing tcc into the generated non linear regressions the parameter θr from van genuchten 1980 mualem model used to describe the soil water retention curve swrc was estimated by the first pedotransfer function from splintex 1 0 prevedello and loyola 2002 silva et al 2017 reis et al 2018 this function requires the sand silt and clay contents bulk and particle density to provide the values of swrc parameters because of the sandy texture of the studied soil the result of θr 0 0860 m3 m 3 was set to the permanent wilting point θpwp based on the results of θcc and θpwp the readily available water capacity rawc was calculated as the second evaluated hydraulic property by means of 2 rawc θcc θpwp p z in which rawc is the readily available water capacity mm θcc is the water content at container capacity m3 m 3 θpwp is the permanent wilting point m3 m 3 z is the root zone depth mm and p is the average fraction of available water that can be depleted from the root zone before moisture stress occurs by evapotranspiration reduction 0 1 in this work we used z for lettuce equal to 50 mm factor of water depletion p of 0 42 according to allen et al 1998 and θcc as the major value obtained from all evaluated scenarios to find the factor p of 0 42 we used the crop evapotranspiration etc calculated by the product of reference evapotranspiration et0 3 mm d 1 and the crop coefficient kc 1 recommended by fao allen et al 1998 the value of et0 was chosen accordingly to agronomic institute of paraná iapar 2017 to curitiba region during the period of the experiment thereby rawc was calculated as 9 11 mm which is equivalent to 160 ml of water by pot for every day of irrigation based on the values of etc and rawc the period of irrigation was estimated as 3 days in the initial strategy of irrigation schedule the third soil examined hydraulic property was the drainable porosity range ϕd which was analyzed under the effect of coffee sludge calculated by 3 ϕd ϕ θcc in which ϕ and ϕd are respectively total porosity and drainable porosity range m3 m 3 and θcc is the water content at container capacity m3 m 3 2 5 effects of spent coffee grounds on crop development aiming to examine whether the addition of scg as soil conditioner would affect the crop development on the studied soil or not the growing of lettuce seedlings of the crop mimosa roxa roxanne were monitored the prepared pots were moved to a greenhouse where the seedlings of lettuce were transplanted into them 32 days after sowing the irrigation practice at the first week started right after the plants transplanting and applied every 3 days as planned before irrigation period was then increased to 4 days after 7 days to 5 days after 14 days and to 6 days in the fourth week after transplanting diminishing the frequency of water supply 28 days after transplanting in order to monitor the behavior of the crop without water supply the last irrigation volume was decreased to 80 ml half the rawc and then finally ceased this last stage was the only one without water supply to the plants the development of lettuce plants was monitored by means of the leaf area index lai and the final wet and dry mass lai was determined by superficial images of every pot after the transplanting process taking pictures at the same hour every 2 days the camera was propped into a holder to ensure the same euclidean height 90 and consequently the same scale for all images reaching more accuracy on lai measures the images were then analyzed in a computer aided design software fig 2 to perform this analysis the crop growth development was divided into 4 phases phase i was from beginning until the 6th day after transplanting phase ii comprehended 7th to 14th day phase iii from 15th to 22th day and phase iv from 23th to 30th day the method of measuring areas by computer aided design software is precise and used in several fields such as in hydrology or mechanical engineering when the determination of perimeter and areas of watershed and small mechanical parts are need inasmuch as the lettuce leaves are curved this standardized method allowed us to determine the evolution of the growing cycle and recognize the patterns of improving decreasing development of the plant in actual experimental conditions which are the interest of the study lettuce plants were monitored throughout the entire growing cycle under irrigation plants were removed from the pots when lai decreased for more than 3 consecutive days the period between the ceasing on irrigation and the removal was defined as the lettuce survival time after this removal the wet mass of the plants was measured for every replicate and scg content then plants were oven dried at 60 c for 3 days for dry mass determination for posteriori statistical analysis of lai wet and dry mass 2 6 soil aeration the minimum required space or minimum drainable porosity ϕd min to allow oxygen diffusion can be estimated by a zero order oxygen consumption function ben noah and friedman 2018 boundary conditions for representing the oxygen concentration at the upper layer as an initial value χ0 and the zero downward flux at the bottom layer should be assumed for solving this function moreover the concentration at this point is zero for representing the total oxygen deficit at the bottom as described in prevedello and armindo 2015 from the diffusion equation in non transient condition this relationship can be written in a soil profile by 4 ϕd min l2φo2 2dχ0 in which ϕd min m3 m 3 is the minimum drainable porosity to favor soil aeration l m is the profile length φo2 kg m 3 s 1 is the respiration rate d m2 s 1 is soil diffusion coefficient and χ0 kg m 3 is the oxygen concentration at soil surface 2 7 statistical analysis all measurements were taken in 4 replicates and then the mean values were used to represent them the values of ρb and ϕ were imposed in all treatments in order to maintain a standardized porous media thus diminishing the coefficient of variation cv among all pots to evaluate the differences between treatments analysis of variance anova combined with tukey test setting significance level at 0 05 were used to compare the mean results 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil hydraulic properties modification the time to soil to reach container capacity tcc and their respective θcc value was determined based on regressions of the mean monitored values of the soil water content θ after free drainage in the pots the results from fitting non linear regressions to every treatment using mean values of θ are presented in fig 3 statistically significant differences were noticed in θcc among the evaluated contents of the soil conditioner confirming the effect of scg on water retention table 3 according to warrick and nielsen s 1980 criterion the coefficient of variation cv values can be considered small because they revealed values less than 12 for θcc among the four replicates this means that every assessed scg concentration shows uniformity in its four replicates the highest result for θcc was observed under the content of 15 of scg which generated consequently the lowest ϕd however there were not significant differences among t10 t15 and t20 casaroli and de jong van lier 2008 discuss that θcc is influenced by soil structure texture bulk density and organic matter content oc thus the addition of a material that promotes changes in oc may alter in some level the values of θcc result that was observed in this experiment with scg kasongo et al 2011 reported that many studies have been carried out about the use of organic waste as agents to improve physicochemical properties in soil with low oc content the authors verified that a mixture of coffee pulp and coffee husk added to a sandy soil has decreased the percolation and improved the water retention in levels of 55 60 regardless the mixture content this result corroborates to the ones in this work where an increase of 31 was observed between the treatments t1 and t15 according to the same authors that change in water retention is related to changes in soil structure due to oc increase the fitted regression based on results of θcc as a function of scg content is presented in fig 4 since this fitted cubic polynomial is valid only to the domain between 0 and 20 of scg in a sandy loam soil it is not applicable to estimate the behavior of values that are not within this range the results of θcc have increased from t0 0 vs 0 396 m3 m 3 until the critical maximum local point 15 07 vs 0 5197 m3 m 3 found out settling the first derivative of the cubic polynomial equal to zero from this point the regression line becomes descending the increasement in θcc until 15 of scg is related to the arrangement of the porous media obtained from the sandy loam soil with the addition of the soil conditioner the reason for the decreasing after 15 is associated with the geometry of pores which was molded with scg addition modifying their shape tortuosity continuity and conductivity this structure of pores can be further investigated using more specific techniques such as micromorphology by the images of tomography or microscopy analysis cruz et al 2014 assessed the antioxidant activity and individual bioactive of some lettuce compounds cultivated with the addition of scg contents from 2 5 to 30 into the soil the results of carotenoids chlorophylls and tocochromanols showed the same behaviour as found for θcc in this work they increased from 0 until 15 of scg and then decreased for 20 of scg thus it seems to have some relationship between this difference on water retention capacity and the development of the plants and its compounds caused by the addition of scg kondamudi et al 2008 evaluated the particle of scg from a cafeteria in nevada eua measuring an approximate diameter of 0 02 mm which is within the range of silt particle size 0 002 0 05 mm and kim et al 2014 commented that specific surface area for grains with this size is about 7500 m2 kg 1 the standard procedures of grinding and toasting coffee vary around the world however there is usually a coarse grind and a medium toast in countries where the high quality coffee is consumed on the other hand the toast in brazil is usually stronger whereas grind is fine so the specific surface area could be even larger than 7500 m2 kg 1 combining this wide value with other particle surface properties might contribute to enhance water retention due to the influence on adhesion adsorption and surface tension at the solid liquid interface prevedello and armindo 2015 therefore scg particles could play the role as silt particles or even as clay depending on the grinding being responsible for an improvement on water retention inferred by θcc the results of rawc table 3 are based on the hypothesis that this material does not alter the mineral composition of the soil by thus the retention in low potentials are not affected by its addition inasmuch as θpwp is mostly dependent on texture for this sandy loam soil cervera mata et al 2017 reported that the addition of scg contents of 2 5 and 10 increased the value of θfc on two mediterranean soils the same increasement behavior observed in this study these authors also evaluated θpwp addressing both decrease and increase in water retention for two different soils however in contrast with this study these two soils were clayey and the behavior of the dry range of the swrc is more affected by the addition of the residue than it is expected in the sandy loam soil all replicates without scg content have presented results of ϕd substantially larger than 0 12 m3 m 3 table 3 meanwhile the other containers have shown results smaller than this critical value although ϕd between 15 and 20 of scg contents did not reduce the value of 0 083 m3 m 3 is still bellow the limiting range of 0 10 0 12 m3 m 3 suggested to most agricultural crops jury et al 1991 prevedello and armindo 2015 reynolds et al 2009 according to these authors this minimum value is needed to occur the process of o2 difusion between the atmosphere and the porous media allowing o2 availability in enough amount to root development therefore even with the improvement on water retention by the increase on θcc and consequently on rawc the development of plants can be considerably impaired when retention and aeration are not balanced negatively affecting soil physical fertility as important as adequate water content the available air space in soil pores has direct influence on the availability of o2 to propitiate gas flux for aerobic activities of roots and microorganisms de jong van lier 2018 the expected o2 consumption rate in the pot was modelled with the measures of ϕd whereas ϕd min was obtained using the soil respiration rate φo2 measured by cervera mata et al 2017 for different scg contents profiles of o2 consumption rate are presented in fig 5 a considering that ϕd is constant throughout the whole soil section the differences on maximum φo2 between scg contents were only expressive in the thin layer from 0 to 0 01 m and reached the magnitude of 10 6 to 10 8 kg m 3 s 1 at the bottom of the pot it indicates that despite the larger available space in treatment t0 from the point of view of oxygen availability this difference matters only in the superficial layer the expected ϕd min for high and low o2 consumption rate based on measures of dommergues and mangenot 1970 in soils without scg and its comparison with the soil respiration rate measured by cervera mata et al 2017 in a soil with 2 5 and 10 of scg are presented in fig 5b results for respiration rate of about 10 8 are reported by dommergues and mangenot 1970 which are represented by means of ϕd min in fig 6 b as high and low consumption considering the order of 10 8 for φo2 measured ϕd was sufficient to allow high respiration rates even at the bottom of the pot and regardless the scg content reaching the minimum value of 8 2 10 8 for 15 of scg at 0 16 m of soil depth however the addition of scg increases the oxygen consumption in soils even without crop cultivation due to the increase on biological activity cervera mata et al 2017 thus while a ϕd min of about 0 05 m3 m 3 at the bottom for the treatment without scg is sufficient to ensure aerobic conditions this value overtake 0 40 m3 m 3 when 10 of scg is added those results indicates that the aerobic conditions could be compromised by the addition of scg so the gain by increasing θcc should be evaluated to not cause impact on ϕd and hence on aeration the lack of significant difference on the properties θcc and ϕd between the treatments t10 and t20 table 3 suggest that new experiments should be accomplished including more subdivisions on scg contents between 0 and 10 of scg contents for this soil 3 2 crop development according to results lettuce plants presented more leaf area index lai without scg addition than with the conditioner fig 6 to other treatments the highest lai was reached at t5 in the end of phase iv however without significant difference table 4 the pair ϕd 0 159 m3 m 3 vs θcc 0 388 m3 m 3 from t0 provided the greatest development of this cultivar 6 45 g and lai 0 7846 the poorest development presented from t5 to t20 can be associated with the reduction on ϕd which occurred with the increase of θcc compared to t0 table 3 corroborating with the reported limitations derived from addition of scg on crop development cervera mata et al 2017 hardgrove and livesley 2016 the increase on θcc affected lettuce development due to low ϕd levels which can directly affect soil aeration providing insufficient space to o2 diffusion jury et al 1991 kim et al 2016 studying scg application on dredged soils found out that fine scg particles prevented o2 permeability by covering soil surface showing up as an inhibiting plant growth factor thereby large results of θcc or even θfc can be adverse to irrigated systems when the critical value of ϕd for the specific crop is not considered significant differences were not observed on lai for phase i demonstrating that results of θcc and ϕd were suitable for all treatments whereas on the next phases the differences on lai wet and dry mass were obvious table 4 all restricted when ϕd was smaller than 0 12 m3 m 3 on the other phases even without significant difference the higher values of lai between t5 and t20 were observed when θcc varied from 0 42 to 0 49 m3 m 3 and ϕd from 0 06 to 0 12 m3 m 3 indeed there was a ϕd decrease with scg addition the lower lettuce yield according to scg addition can be associated with a combination of physical and chemical fertility influence and this effect can be visually observed on fig 7 despite that it was noticed a significant increase on water retention from t0 to t10 suggesting that this study could be performed using other crops lettuce surviving after ceased irrigation was different according to scg addition since scg has influenced the rawc and lai after the last water supply plants from t10 and t20 stayed without decrease on lai for 21 days whereas on t0 this occurred for only 8 days the larger results of rawc caused by the conditioner addition as well as the higher hydric demand in t0 due to evapotranspiration corroborates with that result 3 3 perspectives and considerations for spent coffee grounds as soil conditioner aiming mainly to evaluate the scg effects as conditioner to alter the soil physical hydraulic properties by promoting adequate discard to this waste material in the cheapest and easiest way its chemical correction was not performed after added into the soil therefore even in small contents scg could have negatively influenced the lettuce development as verified by hardgrove and livesley 2016 to the crops broccoli leek radish viola and sunflower it was also observed by cervera mata et al 2017 that lettuce development was suppress by scg addition although this residue has collaborated to change the electrical conductivity and the ratio between carbon and nitrogen this suppression also observed in this work should be better explained because even a small scg amount in t5 0 1044 kg table 2 was sufficient to significant decrease lai and biomass production these decreases were not significantly different on the other assessed contents table 4 indicating among other non studied factors the aeration deficit influence future studies should evaluate whether the chemical correction of soil after addition of scg is a suitable practice or not by analyzing its chemical effect on crop production the induction of hydric stress with less frequent irrigation depths larger than 6 days should be also evaluated additionally studies in less thickened soils to promote greater porosity with more scg contents between 0 and 10 to promote the increase of θcc without compromise ϕd could show peculiarities that was not entirely revealed with our experimental design this work corroborates with the need of research on the use of this residue currently with no costs as a conditioner to improve the physical fertility in soils with small water retention including pots with ornamental cultivation potential despite the lettuce development was spoiled by soil aeration on this work scg addition indeed promoted soil hydraulic properties changes this effect can positively benefit other porous medium and crops being therefore better explored in further studies since scg application has been reported to enable the development of arboreal trees in dredged soils kim et al 2016 and increases dry matter production in sandy soils in the humid tropics kasongo et al 2013 its application in soils with low retention capacity only on crop lines or in pits to tree species with large planting spacing should be evaluated to better reclamation of local rainfall or irrigation water in arid and semiarid regions 4 conclusions in this study the application of scg as soil conditioner was investigated together with its influence on lettuce growth changes on soil hydraulic properties were observed such as water retention and aeration evidencing scg as a potential conditioner to soils with poor retention capacity water content at container capacity increased from 0 to 15 of scg and decreased from 15 to 20 although 7 of increase on θcc from 10 to 15 of scg this gain was not significant suggesting that the application of scg contents larger than 10 for sandy loam soils should not be done high contents of scg spoiled the development of lettuce crop causing significantly decrease on leaf area index lai and cumulative mass indicating the excessive application the highest results for mass and lai were observed when drainable porosity overcame 0 118 m3 m 3 in the pot without scg since it was not induced hydric stress in any scg content plants cultivated under the contents of 10 and 15 survived through 21 days after the last irrigation due to a combination of less lai implying less evapotranspiration and larger rawc the application of this study in other soils and plants remains open enabling as an alternative destination to this organic waste yielded by coffee brews preparation 
10969,the present study investigates alternative scenarios of timing and reduced water supply in terms of their impacts on agricultural land use farm revenue and food crop production it aims to evaluate the implications for the development of different farming systems in one of the most water scarce irrigation districts in the zayandeh rud river basin in central iran the roudasht irrigation district a modified version of positive mathematical programming pmp model was used to assess the scenarios the results from the scenario simulations illustrate that there is substantial potential for improving the management of the limited water supply in the roudasht irrigation network to reach higher water productivity agricultural output and gross margins from agricultural activities a management plan to target a limit in the irrigation water supply only for the month of peak demand e g 60 to 80 of the baseline water supply for may in roudasht may have less adverse effects than planning to limit the annual water supply by the same amount but without specifying the monthly timing of the water supply these results highlight the relevance and impact of the timing of water supply when devising adaptive measures related to the irrigation water supply keywords adaptation measures water supply timing water scarcity pmp zayandeh rud 1 introduction iran is located in one of the world s most water scarce regions i e the middle east and has experienced an unprecedented water shortage since the beginning of the 1990s yazdanpanah et al 2013 there are strong indications that this country now faces a continuing severe water crisis which is further exacerbated by the recent high population growth rates urbanization industrialization and expanding agriculture during last decades zobeidi et al 2016 madani et al 2016 boazar et al 2019 the full extent of this socio economic drought caused by water demand exceeding the natural water supply is not still apparent madani et al 2016 however the negative potentials for the country s future is a major concern for the policymakers and water resource managers madani et al 2016 nabavi 2018 continuation of the current status of water resources substantially threatens iran s economic development food security public health and upsets social and national stability michel 2017 boazar et al 2019 therefore the practical and sustainable management of water resources has currently become the primary concern for the iranian authorities and the top priority in the development plans hadizadeh et al 2018 like other semi arid countries irrigated agriculture claims the lion s share of renewable water resources in iran nazari et al 2018 estimations suggest that the agricultural sector consumes up to 92 equal to 81 6 bcm of water withdrawals while this sector only produces 10 of gdp saatsaz 2019 due to the growing demand for water by industry and municipalities combined with environmental problems agriculture is going to be the most affected sector in the future according to the national water conservation plan iran aims to reduce irrigation water use to about 80 percent withdrawals of total renewable freshwater by 2025 national strategic plan on water resources 2014 thus policymakers and society have an urgent need to understand what options exist to adapt to current and future developments of water resources and to mitigate the negative externalities of water scarcity particularly for the agricultural sector in response to the water crisis the iranian government strategy has undergone a change moving from mainly supply oriented management towards demand oriented management which was not a significant policy until recently yazdanpanah et al 2013 yazdanpanah et al 2015 boazar et al 2019 the supply oriented engineering based schemes mainly focused on increasing water availability by developing massive water transfer projects or inter basin water transfer madani 2014 mehta 2014 while the demand oriented schemes rely primarily on water conservation and or reallocation measures to reduce water demand mehta 2014 recognizing that the implemented supply oriented water policies namely water transfer have been ineffective in increasing the sustainability of the water resources the iranian officials have recently emphasized the goal of water conservation and water productivity as the binding obligations for the national water resource plans madani 2014 entekhab 2018 without considering the demand side causes of the water shortage supply side policies can only cure the symptoms of the water crisis in the short run rather than in the long run gohari et al 2013 madani 2014 nabavi et al 2017 the zayandeh rud basin one of the most complex basins in central iran is experiencing a severe water shortage the main share of the cultivated area in the basin relies on irrigation the supply of which has experienced drastic reductions in the last decades leading to social unrest iranian agriculture ministry 2018 mohajeri et al 2016 nabavi 2018 currently work is ongoing to implement an integrated water resource management system in the basin mohajeri and horlemann 2017 the uncertainty of water availability is a critical factor for the farming systems within the zayandeh rud basin not knowing when and how much water will be supplied the farmers prepare every year for the cultivation of the available land but if no or not enough water is allocated to the fields all the efforts and expenses e g seed fertilizer are for nothing thus policymakers on the one hand have an urgent need to understand how farmers react to adapt to current and future developments of water resources i e demand side management on the other hand farmers should know about when and how much water is available over the year in order to mitigate the negative externalities of water scarcity i e supply oriented management the present analysis extends the existing literature on water resource management and allocation in two dimensions first many studies have applied mathematical programming approaches to simulate the impacts of annual water shortage particularly in the zayandeh rud basin see e g rezaei et al 2017 anvari et al 2017 ahmadi et al 2018 however water availability not only varies on an annual basis but also over the different months of a year isfahan water authority 2016 it is quite apparent that irrigation water demand water is not equally distributed over the year surprisingly only a little attention has been given to changing the timing of water allocation or water consumption as a policy measure for adapting to water scarcity see karamouz et al 2004 bazargan lari et al 2009 wang et al 2019 changes in the timing of water supply may improve economic productivity evans and sadler 2008 second to our knowledge this is the first study in the literature on water resource management of the zayandeh rud basin using monthly disaggregated positive mathematical programming pmp to investigate water related policies so far pmp has been widely applied in the literature and proved to be a useful approach to investigate water related policies in the agriculture sector e g cortignani and severini 2011 medellin azuara et al 2012 howitt et al 2012 booker et al 2012 graveline and mérel 2014 pmp is the backbone of many agro and hydro economic models regarding water related issues around the world see table a in appendix a the present study applies a modified version of pmp which is able to identify monthly water allocation and monthly water requirements applying pmp based models has several advantages compared with the other applied optimization models in water resource management literature most importantly pmp has been proved to provide more realistic reaction change than similar alternatives like non linear mathematical programming booker et al 2012 lee et al 2019 pmp helps the approach avoid overspecialization due to the corner solution problem merel and howitt 2014 considering the multi faceted of agricultural related policies overspecialization is likely to be an unrealistic solution second pmp exactly reproduces the observed behaviour of farmers i e the crop mix in the base year without adding artificial constraints merel and howitt 2014 gómez limón et al 2016 whereas other types of optimization simulation models i e normative approach require extra subjective constraints in order to make solution close to the status quo gómez limón et al 2016 lee et al 2019 justifying a model which is based on an accurate calibration and a set of a priori constraints is a critical requirement for policy models to be accepted by policymakers merel and howitt 2014 the present study aims to investigate the role of water supply timing in improving irrigation water productivity in one of the most vulnerable districts in the zayandeh rud basin roudasht the most downstream irrigation district in the river basin which is currently faced with a water crisis nikouei and ward 2013 in our analysis we apply a modified version of pmp model to assess how reduced quantities and changes in the timing of water supply influences the choice of crops for cultivation and hence the irrigation water productivity and the farm revenue to do so we defined four scenarios with various annual water shortages and monthly water shortages during peak demand it aims to inform policymakers and public administrations on how farmers can adapt to alternative water supply practices furthermore it seeks to make an important contribution to help farmers cope with possible external challenges and the water resource manager to formalize a robust policy initiative 2 study area the closed semi arid zayandeh rud river basin is one of the most important river basins of iran which provides water for approximately 4 5 million residents and 270 000 ha of agricultural land in central iran schramm and sattary 2014 felmenden 2014 the zayandeh rud river relies substantially on the annual snowfall in the zagros mountains as its source mohajeri et al 2016 the river is regulated by an upstream dam which creates the chadegan reservoir and ends in the ecologically important gavkhuni wetland fig 1 the agricultural sector is the main user of water in the basin using 80 90 of the total water withdrawn of the rest 10 20 is distributed to the industry and household sectors leaving little to none for the gavkhuni wetland gohari et al 2013 raber 2017 the basin has approximately 11 main irrigation networks served by surface water from the zayandeh rud river and ground water in on going work in an iranian german consortium to implement integrated water resource management in the basin hydrological modeling of the complex surface and ground water flows throughout the basin which considers water use in the industrial agricultural and domestic sectors is being developed mohajeri and horlemann 2017 however the modeling is still under development so that only the data on water supply could be used here the focus of the paper here is on the roudasht irrigation network which is the furthest downstream it is located in the east of the province and is divided into two sub regions south and north fig 1 it has been particularly affected by the recent water crisis since the expansion of irrigation facilities in the upper basin has reduced the amount of water supplied to roudasht and gavkhuni wetland downstream molle and mamanpoush 2012 water shortages and water management issues in the roudasht network are in the focus of decision makers at all levels in particular because of its closeness to the water demanding industrial area of the city of isfahan as well as being the last district before the gavkhuni wetland thus in the present study we focused on roudasht district for our case study in the zayandeh rud basin more than 12 500 active farmers work on around 20 000 ha of irrigated land in the roudasht network raber 2017 isfahan agricultural organization 2016 although some dryland farming is practiced in the upper part of the basin due to the highly variable and low annual rainfall in roudasht of around 120 mm a farmers depend on the supply of irrigation water fig 2 shows the annual water inflows to the roudasht irrigation network during the period of 2004 2015 the average was 71 49 mcm however the data reveals that the water supply has been below the average in most years of the last decade moreover the distribution of water within the year varies strongly which shows there has not been a pre determined plan to supply water during different months see fig 3 lack of reliability in irrigation planning often causes more land to be planted than can be irrigated and harvested e g in 2010 half of the cultivated land could not be harvested raber et al 2018 the major crops in the region are wheat and barley followed by alfalfa safflower cotton and vegetables such as beet fig 4 shows the monthly water requirement of major crops in the area this figure demonstrates that the distribution of the water requirement over a year for each crop is quite diverse therefore changing land use can potentially change the total water demand in different months of the year 3 model and methods in this section we elaborate on the process by which our model is applied to analyze water availability scenarios fig 5 shows the conceptual framework used it is based on connecting the demand and supply side for water policy decisions by evaluating the effects such decisions would have on farmers and their revenues through simulation 1 first policy decisions regarding water supply and the agriculture sector are formulated by the government 2 scenarios are made to describe common policy decisions on water availability the four scenarios used in this paper are described in detail in section 3 4 below current resource constraints market and production data are used to describe the baseline case 3 then the reaction of farmers toward water availabilities is simulated by using pmp 4 based on the simulation results for crop mix input use and farm revenue 5 the annual and monthly water demand can be estimated continuing the loop the information from the demand side on the estimated water use provides policymakers with a basis to readjust the water supply for the next period the standard calibration of pmp models is achieved by a procedure in three steps cortignani and severini 2011 medellin azuara et al 2012 howitt et al 2012 as follow 3 1 step 1 base linear model we first specify a linear optimization problem subject to two types of constraints the regular resource constraints and calibration constraints the structure of pmp in our analysis is given by 1 m a x x s i z s i p i y s i x s i j a s i j x s i c s i j l i n e a r o b j e c t i v e f u n c t i o n 2 s i x s i t o l t o t a l l a n d c o n s t r a i n t 3 s i w u s i m x s i t w m monthly water constraint 4 m 1 12 t

for crop i wheat barley alfalfa cotton and beet and irrigation system s furrow and pressurized irrigation systems p i y s i are respectively price and average yield for crop i and irrigation system s a s i j and c s i j respectively indicate leontief coefficients and the unit cost of input j land irrigation labor machinery fertilizers for crop i and irrigation system s as in previous literature we assume water and land are the dominant constraints and they must be allocated optimally across alternative crops cortignani and severini 2011 medellin azuara et al 2012 accordingly eq 2 represents land constraint with tol as total agricultural land use in the case study as laid out above as a modification of our model we specify eqs 3 and 4 to capture monthly and annual water use in these constraints w u s i m and t w m are the water requirement of crop i irrigation system s and monthly water available in month m respectively we also define eq 4 to ensure that the sum of monthly water use is less than the annual water available i e taw a calibration constraint on land use will be included to find the unique dual shadow prices for each crop activities under different irrigation system i e λ s i medellin azuara et al 2012 as detailed in howitt 1995 the shadow values of calibration constraint are the cornerstone to the subsequent calibration process the aim of the first step is to predict the shadow price of calibration constraint to be used in the next step 3 2 step 2 yield parameter estimation with maximum entropy step two aims to estimate reproduce parameters for a quadratic pmp yield function using the shadow price i e lagrange multiplier obtained from the calibration constraints in eq 5 medellin azuara et al 2012 we specify a quadratic yield function as follow 6 n y s i α s i j n x s i j β s i j n x s i j 2 n o n l i n e a r y i e l d f u n c t i o n where α s i j and β s i j indicate intercept and slope of non linear yield function and n x s i j denotes the amount of input i used in crop j and irrigation system s despite α s i j β s i j is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix which is difficult to be recovered paris and howitt 1998 estimation of slope matrix i e β s i j by using shadow prices i e λ s i from the first step and the vector of realized input output information yields an ill posed problem this problem is not solvable by the traditional econometric approach following paris and howitt 1998 and howitt and msangi 2006 2014 we apply the maximum entropy technique 1 1 maximum entropy has some advantages compared to other alternatives for more detail see paris and howitt 1998 howitt and msangi 2014 and howitt and msangi 2019 to estimate reproduce the parameters of non linear yield function 3 3 step 3 non linear calibrated model in the third step the following non linear quadratic objective function is plugged into the linear model and the calibration land constraint is removed 7 m a x n x s i j nl z s i j α s i j n x s i j β s i j n x s i j 2 s i j c s i j n x s i j n o n l i n e a r o b j e c t i v e f u n c t i o n where n x s i j is the decision variable denoting the amount of input j which is used for crop i and irrigation system s the calibrated nonlinear model including eqs 7 2 4 is able to recover the base year information without adding calibration constraints besides the quadratic objective function of the final model is useful to avoid overspecialization solution and thereby the final calibrated model is more flexible to simulate policy changes lee et al 2019 policies entailing limited water availability either on a monthly basis or annually require changing the right hand sides of water constraints in eqs 3 and 4 we first determine the baseline situation reproduced by the calibrated model according to the land use in the reference year 2015 the calibrated model is run and the resulting distribution of water demand is taken as the baseline the model was run using the gams software the input data for the model including crop prices crop yields input requirements input prices and the current land use as the baseline was partly collected by the survey from local farmers within the basin the coefficients and parameters gathered include monthly water requirement per hectare machinery use cost per hour labor use fertilizer including nitrate and phosphate requirement per hectare and chemical use per hectare for all crops according to the criteria crop diversification the samples were divided into two clusters of less diversified farms cultivating 3 or less crops and more diversified farms cultivating more than 3 crops the land use of each farm type was calculated according to the average of samples of land use in each class appendix b displays the characteristics of each type of farm including average land use and crop yields besides the data on total land use was calculated according to the agriculture organization of isfahan agriculture organization of isfahan aoi 2015 dataset for the crop year of 2014 2015 the validity of data was assessed by comparing with other data set and also expert views further data was provided by official statistic institutes including aoi fao data on the crop yield respond function and agricultural support service co and regional water authority and ministry of energy 3 4 scenario development making decisions about water supply and distribution from the reservoir to the irrigation network during different months is a challenging issue for the managers of the water authorities in the zayandeh rud basin some experts have suggested that reallocating the water supply over the year may result in higher water productivity of agricultural production in the zayandeh rud basin by allowing farmers to react to alternative water supply practices nikouei and ward 2013 gohari et al 2014 redesigning the allocation of water may lead to reduced water use in some months of the year the saved water could be used to cover the water demands of crops during other months of the year when the water supply is more critical and consequently support farmers in the basin to react and adapt to drought conditions the effects of two possible approaches to reducing water supply were investigated in this study in the first approach a planned cut to the water supply in the month of the peak water demand was simulated as fig 6 illustrates the peak water demand for agricultural crop production in roudasht is often centered in the month of may the historical data fig 3 shows that water supply in may has varied in the last years within a broad range of between 10 to 23 mcm the water demand in may calculated for the baseline year on the basis of the crop production is 24 94 mcm fig 7 moreover during april and may competition among water users agriculture industry and household in the basin is particularly high due to increasing average temperature and decreasing rainfall in these months based on this information we considered alternative water supply scenarios for addressing the imbalance between the actual water supply and the desirable water supply in may from the perspective of crop production in the first two scenarios s1p20 and s2p40 a limitation in the water supply in may is simulated by limiting the water supply in that month t w m in the equation 8 to 80 s1p20 and 60 s2p40 of the water demand in the baseline scenario fig 6a however competition for water between the agricultural sector and other water users such as the industry sector and private households is not limited to certain months in the year but takes place throughout the whole year therefore we investigated a set of scenarios where the limitation of the water supply is not set monthly s3a20 and s4a40 but annually s3a20 and s4a40 simulate a limitation of the annual water supply for irrigation of agricultural crops to 80 and 60 of the total water annual demand in the baseline scenario fig 6b overall four scenarios were defined as follows scenario s1p20 limiting the water supply in may to 80 of the baseline water demand i e reducing the water supply for irrigation during may by at least 20 compared to the baseline water demand scenario s2p40 limiting the water supply in may to 60 of the baseline water demand i e reducing the water supply for irrigation during may by at least 40 compared to the baseline water demand scenario s3a20 limiting the water supply within a year to 80 of the baseline water demand i e reducing the water supply for irrigation within a year by at least 20 compared to the baseline water demand scenario s4a40 limiting the water supply within a year to 60 of the baseline water demand i e reducing the water supply for irrigation within a year by at least 40 compared to the baseline water demand the impacts of these four scenarios are examined separately for two clusters of farms i e one cluster with more diversified farms with more than 4 crops and one with less diversified farms with less than 4 crops in the farm this clustering was made to take into consideration different capacities for adaptation based on the diversity of cropping activities the average agricultural land size of the less diversified farms is smaller than that of the diversified farms we also analyze the implications of water supply scenarios on the land cropped by the farms in total to provide a more aggregated view of the total crop production in the basin 4 results and discussion in this section we present the results of the scenario simulations on changing the cultivation area of crops total water use and water productivity indices gross margin and agricultural employment the analysis shows the results are very farm type dependent therefore after discussing the results aggregated for all farms in the total irrigation district area the results for the two typical farm clusters i e diversified farms and less diversified farms are discussed individually 4 1 overview of all farms in general agricultural land use decreases in all scenarios when the water supply is reduced either in total or in the peak month the percentage change in the total cultivated area for each crop in the study area declines as a result of parameter changes in the four scenarios described in sections 3 2 fig 7 this is critical in view of the overall policy goal in iran to maintain production levels high and attain self sufficiency in food production however a reduction in the cultivated area does not necessarily mean production must decrease the results show that the percentage change in land use between the different scenarios varies the limitation of the water supply during the peak month of may scenario s1p20 and s2p40 results in a reduction in land for all crops though the reductions in the land used for wheat and barley are higher it explicitly shows that the production of wheat and barley is highly affected by water supply in may in contrast the results of the scenarios s3a20 and s4a40 show that the land used for cotton beet and alfalfa cultivation decreases over proportionally when the water supply reduction is not limited to a specific period of time within the year the land cultivated with wheat and barley decreases less in s3a20 and s4a40 than for the other crops due to their lower water requirements the timing of a reduction in the water supply may impact the land use allocation and production structure this offers some scope to decision makers and farmers to well aligned water supply and agricultural land use the findings displayed in table 1 demonstrate that the limitation of water supply in all scenarios results in different cropping patterns that are characterized by lower water use compared to the baseline scenario the reduction in water use is similar to the reduction in the water supply in all scenarios however the production does not decrease proportionally to the reduction in water use and water supply in the scenarios while water use is reduced by 18 8 and 37 9 in the scenarios s1p20 and s2p40 production only decreases by 9 4 in the scenario s1p20 and by 21 in the scenario s2p40 the physical water productivity pwp defined as the ratio of the fresh mass of production to water use kg m3 increased for both scenarios by 11 and 27 the same is true for the other two scenarios s3a20 and s4a40 economic water productivity ewp is defined by molden et al 2010 as the value gross margin derived per unit of water m3 used in our analysis we focus on ewp as the appropriate indicator since it considers not only the crop yield but also the variable costs of production the results in fig 8 show that ewp increases when the water supply is limited the increase in ewp is higher when the water supply is limited in the peak month of may only the increase in ewp is less pronounced when the water supply is not limited to a specific month or period of time within the year limiting water supply in the month of may can contribute to an increase in the average gross margin derived per unit of water the changes in agricultural gross margin and agricultural employment in the short run as shown in table 1 are indicators of changes in the farmer s and rural community s revenues the decreasing land use due to water supply reductions results in a short term decrease in the labor requirements for agricultural activities a trend confirmed by the simulation results in table 1 however under s1p20 the percentage reduction in agricultural employment is less than the percentage reduction in irrigation water supply and the percentage reduction in the cultivated land even a decrease in agricultural employment as a reduction in the water supply seems inevitable the impact on employment can be lessened by limiting the water supply in the peak month of may only fig 9 shows the monthly water distribution calculated by the model in the four scenarios as it was explained above limiting water supply in may leads to the reallocation of the water towards crops with lower water requirement in may consequently this scenario changes annual land use and crop production which consequently result in changes of the water demand in the other months of the year water demand changes in may are more pronounced in the scenarios s1p20 and s2p40 compared to s3p20 and s4p40 in contrast water demand changes more in other months of the year in the scenarios s3p20 and s4p40 compared to the scenarios s1p20 and s2p40 except in the months of november and april this may have some implications for the utilization of infrastructure and the public perception of water supply limitations 4 2 less diversified farms the percentage changes shown in fig 10 in crop cultivation of the farms with less diversified crop production indicate for the scenario s1p20 more pronounced changes in land used for wheat 25 1 followed by barley 14 4 and alfalfa 3 7 by decreasing water supply in may scenarios s1p20 and s2p40 the area under wheat and barley decreases drastically while the area under alfalfa decreases only slightly additionally in the scenarios s3a20 and s4a40 the area under alfalfa and barley decreases more compared with wheat this is due to the lower water productivity and higher water requirements of alfalfa and barley as a result certain activities and related value chains like animal husbandry based on alfalfa as forage may be more affected by a water supply reduction especially in the case of less diversified farms and if the water supply is reduced throughout the year in the farms with less diversified crop production a limitation of the water supply in the month of may has a similar impact on total land use and annual water use as if the water supply is limited to no specific month or period of time within the year table 2 the reductions in gross margin total production and employment are disproportionally lower than the reduction in the water supply this indicates that there is some scope for improvement in terms of economic water productivity the reduction in water and land use leads to decreases in agricultural production gross margin and input uses table 2 the decrease in production is lower than the reduction in land and water usage which indicates that farmers are able to compensate the impact of reduced water and land inputs by increasing the productivity of water and land and still produce the same output fig 11 also confirms that both ewp and pwp increase as water supply is reduced water productivity is slightly higher under s1p20 and s2p40 compared with s3a20 and s4a40 resulting in a preference for reducing the supply of water in the peak month of may only the cropping pattern changes due to decreasing water supply in may by 20 lead to changes in water demand in other months especially in january february march and april in these months the difference in water demand is less pronounced between a water supply reduction in the peak month may only compared to a water supply reduction with no specific month or period of time within the year in all other months water demand tends to be lower in the case of a reduction in water demand with no specific month or period of time within the year 4 3 more diversified farms and different irrigation systems the changes in the crop areas of more diversified farms in the four scenarios show similar to the case of less diversified farms that both a moderate and a stronger limitation of the water supply in the month of may s1p20 and s2p40 leads to decreased areas under alfalfa wheat and barley fig 13 the scenarios also result in a minor increase in the areas under cotton and beet with a reduction in the water supply in may of at least 40 the areas under all crops decline among the crops the land under barley and wheat decreases significantly due to the low water productivity of both crops as a result water supply reductions may lead to an increase in the cultivated area of certain crops in more diversified farms if water supply reductions are moderate more diversified farms have the means to overcompensate the impact of a reduced water supply by expanding the areas of crops with higher economic water productivities in the more diversified farms two different types of irrigation systems are being employed pressurized irrigation with higher efficiency and furrow flood irrigation with lower efficiency see appendix b the technical and economic coefficients of the two irrigation systems are significantly different therefore the cropping activities in the model were formulated in a disaggregated way including the two irrigation systems and their technical and economic coefficients for analyzing the distinct impacts on farms with different irrigation systems as fig 14 shows in a drought situation or limitation of water supply the area under pressurized irrigation system decreases less than the area under furrow technology this finding is in line with other studies in iran showing that water scarcity motivates farmers to implement efficient irrigation systems by replacing furrow irrigation zamani 2012 also under scenario s1p20 the percentage change in pressurized irrigation increases slightly this means that reduced water supply in the month of may can result in farmers favoring pressurized irrigation over furrow irrigation however due to technical constraints in particular the salinity of the water available for irrigation expanding pressurized irrigation systems should be considered carefully in any policy recommendations the total land use decreases due to a reduction in the water supply in all scenarios table 3 the reduction in total land and water use in more diversified farms is notably lower than the reductions in land and water use in less diversified farms this result calls for a differentiated approach for managing the water supply to more and less diversified farms it is also an argument for supporting diversification strategies for farms in the region the summary statistics for the changes in agricultural gross margin depict that the level of losses in gross margins increases as water availabilities monthly and annual decrease especially in the scenario s4a40 the results suggest that with respect to the baseline s1p20 requires the lowest and s4a40 scenarios require the lowest and the highest gm compensations by 0 51 and 2 3 2 2 it is computed by subtracting gm s4a40 gm baseline 9 63 11 95 2 32 thousand euro respectively fewer workers are employed in crop production as a result of decreasing land use due to water supply changes consequently the number of required workers decreases which is confirmed by the results in table 3 just like other sample groups less inputs are used water land and labor and less agricultural products are produced however in the more diversified farms the ewp in s1p20 and s2p40 is slightly lower than in s3a20 ands4a40 fig 15 this finding may be related to different cropping patterns and different water requirement over the year the result points towards a preference of more diversified farms for limiting the water supply without a limitation in a specific month or period in the year compared to the less diversified farms see fig 12 during spring and summer more water is demanded by the farmers with more diversified cropping patterns fig 16 just like other sample groups cropping pattern changes due to water supply limitation in may which again leads to changing water demand in other months as shown in fig 16 in addition any limitations in water supply in may have a substantial impact on water demand in february march and april whereas it has minor impacts on the water use during summer i e june july and august these results indicate the more diversified farms have a different pattern of adaptation to water supply reductions compared to less diversified farms water demand changes are less pronounced when farm have more options of crops for cultivation 5 conclusion and policy implications this paper investigates the impacts on agricultural production of various water conservation scenarios using different timings in water supply in the roudasht irrigation network of the zayandeh rud basin in iran to this end we use an agro economic model to compare the impacts of two types of water supply restrictions including 1 a limitation of water supply in the peak demand month of may within the dry season of the year and 2 a limitation of water supply distributed over the month of the year the impacts modeled include changes in land allocation for crop production total water and land use water productivity of the total cropped area economic water productivity employment and total production these impacts were analyzed separately for two groups of farms i e more diversified and less diversified farms as argued by wang et al 2019 findings show that water supply management should consider reducing the water supply in different timing periods of the year in a planned way the results for the roudasht irrigation network indicate that limiting water supply during the dry season where water demand is highest i e in the peak water demand month of may leads to a decrease in the total cultivated agricultural land a similar impact was found when reducing water supply throughout the year however the economic impacts measured as ewp economic water productivity are different when water supply reductions take place throughout the year or only within a specific period of time in the year i e during the dry season these findings are in line with evans and sadler 2008 who showed that adjusting the timing of water supply may lead to increased regional net economic returns further differences were found regarding the impact caused by targeted water supply reductions on land allocation and shares of single crops in the cultivated area the agricultural area cropped with wheat and barley decreases more than that of other crops which reflects the high sensitivity of these crops towards a reduced water supply in may the potential effects of water supply reductions and timing vary in the case of more diversified and less diversified farms even the land used for wheat cultivation decreases comparatively more than that of other crops in both farm types as a consequence of water supply reductions and timing our findings also indicate that the impact of limiting the water supply in may on the farm revenue is less pronounced in more diversified farms than in less diversified farms farmers in more diversified farms cultivate various crops with different monthly water requirements and therefore they have more options to adjust in case of a limitation of the water supply for the case of annual water supply limitation without specification of the timing crops with a higher annual water requirement are reduced more relative to wheat and barley which have a lower water requirement if farmers are aware of the targeted reduction of water supply in the peak demand period they may e g adapt by decreasing the share of crops in the rotation which has higher water requirement during that specific time period in general negative changes in performance parameters resulting from decreasing the water supply in the month of may were more pronounced in the less diversified farms compared to the more diversified farms the scope of adaptation to water supply reductions is assumed to be more limited in the case of less diversified farms compared to more diversified farms therefore our results indicate that robustness against water shortage and irregular water supply may be increased through diversification of crop production an implication of these results for the policy is to remove measures that limit a free crop selection by farmers this is closely related to the recommendation expressed by some authors not to push policywise the production of certain crops for self sufficiency like wheat and others gohari et al 2013 madani et al 2016 such policies may reduce the scope for adaptation to water supply reduction by giving preference to some crops with lower water productivity against others with higher productivity instead increasing the scope of adaptation by encouraging higher diversity in the selection of crops may contribute to reducing water demand while reducing the negative economic impact at the farm level of water supply limitation our findings have several important policy implications for managing water resources in line with previous literature e g gohari et al 2013 boazar et al 2019 our results indicate that advance planning and coordination of water management and especially water supply in accordance with water requirement at farm level can help to adapt and reduce physical and economic losses from water supply limitations the results underline the findings from gohari et al 2013 madani 2014 nabavi et al 2017 and hadizadeh et al 2018 that formulating supply oriented measures without scrutinizing demand side management options is an incomplete water policy design top down water supply management practices need to be replaced or complemented by bottom up practices considering the conditions at the farm level hadizadeh et al 2018 the success of water management practices highly depends on the willingness to accept and adapt by farmers boazar et al 2019 the reaction of farmers towards different water availability scenarios should be considered in policy evaluation our analysis highlights the importance of predictable water availability for effective water conservation policy by announcing the water supply plan in advance understanding how farmers behave and respond to water availability and water supply timing are crucial to estimating the potential irrigation water demand in a specific season or in total in order to implement such policy in practice the maximum and minimum of water availability with reasonable likelihoods needs to be determined for the agricultural sector in advance changes in the land use cropping pattern and monthly water requirements in response to a change in the water supply can be estimated using agro economic modeling on a regional scale adaptation plans and compensation schemes for cases of water shortage can be designed according to the model based estimates of seasonal water demand farmers suffering from water shortages and subsequent yield losses frequently demand some type of compensation measures that allows them to continue in farming appraisals of economic losses can be used as proxies to determine the level of compensation required for different types of farmers well aligned water supply practices can contribute to reducing the need for such compensatory measures if the farmers adapt their cropping patterns accordingly this study basically focused on timing and reduced water supply in terms of their impacts on agricultural land use the input uses and farm revenue further aspects that affect farmer revenues and their ability to adapt are not only the quantity of water delivered but also the quality of the water salinization of the soil is a major concern in water scarce areas and farmers often resort to reusing of brackish water from irrigation drainage canals and shallow groundwater layers inadequate water supply hinders salt leaching measures in the case study as we do not have detailed information on the irrigation water reuse and water quality we cannot disentangle these effects in our empirical study thus future research is recommended to incorporate the impacts of water quality and irrigation water reuse in the empirical model considering water quality is especially relevant in case farmers utilize shallow wells to extract irrigation water since this tends to be more polluted with residues from plant protection and fertilization other limitations of the present study are a the water supply timing at basin level could provide more information about the inter regional water transfer over different months b our model can be extended to include monthly water deficit c future plans are to combine the pmp model with the hydrological model being developed for the basin in order to estimate effects of policy changes and d the applicability of water supply restrictions should be validated using participatory modeling techniques conflict of interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary material

10969,the present study investigates alternative scenarios of timing and reduced water supply in terms of their impacts on agricultural land use farm revenue and food crop production it aims to evaluate the implications for the development of different farming systems in one of the most water scarce irrigation districts in the zayandeh rud river basin in central iran the roudasht irrigation district a modified version of positive mathematical programming pmp model was used to assess the scenarios the results from the scenario simulations illustrate that there is substantial potential for improving the management of the limited water supply in the roudasht irrigation network to reach higher water productivity agricultural output and gross margins from agricultural activities a management plan to target a limit in the irrigation water supply only for the month of peak demand e g 60 to 80 of the baseline water supply for may in roudasht may have less adverse effects than planning to limit the annual water supply by the same amount but without specifying the monthly timing of the water supply these results highlight the relevance and impact of the timing of water supply when devising adaptive measures related to the irrigation water supply keywords adaptation measures water supply timing water scarcity pmp zayandeh rud 1 introduction iran is located in one of the world s most water scarce regions i e the middle east and has experienced an unprecedented water shortage since the beginning of the 1990s yazdanpanah et al 2013 there are strong indications that this country now faces a continuing severe water crisis which is further exacerbated by the recent high population growth rates urbanization industrialization and expanding agriculture during last decades zobeidi et al 2016 madani et al 2016 boazar et al 2019 the full extent of this socio economic drought caused by water demand exceeding the natural water supply is not still apparent madani et al 2016 however the negative potentials for the country s future is a major concern for the policymakers and water resource managers madani et al 2016 nabavi 2018 continuation of the current status of water resources substantially threatens iran s economic development food security public health and upsets social and national stability michel 2017 boazar et al 2019 therefore the practical and sustainable management of water resources has currently become the primary concern for the iranian authorities and the top priority in the development plans hadizadeh et al 2018 like other semi arid countries irrigated agriculture claims the lion s share of renewable water resources in iran nazari et al 2018 estimations suggest that the agricultural sector consumes up to 92 equal to 81 6 bcm of water withdrawals while this sector only produces 10 of gdp saatsaz 2019 due to the growing demand for water by industry and municipalities combined with environmental problems agriculture is going to be the most affected sector in the future according to the national water conservation plan iran aims to reduce irrigation water use to about 80 percent withdrawals of total renewable freshwater by 2025 national strategic plan on water resources 2014 thus policymakers and society have an urgent need to understand what options exist to adapt to current and future developments of water resources and to mitigate the negative externalities of water scarcity particularly for the agricultural sector in response to the water crisis the iranian government strategy has undergone a change moving from mainly supply oriented management towards demand oriented management which was not a significant policy until recently yazdanpanah et al 2013 yazdanpanah et al 2015 boazar et al 2019 the supply oriented engineering based schemes mainly focused on increasing water availability by developing massive water transfer projects or inter basin water transfer madani 2014 mehta 2014 while the demand oriented schemes rely primarily on water conservation and or reallocation measures to reduce water demand mehta 2014 recognizing that the implemented supply oriented water policies namely water transfer have been ineffective in increasing the sustainability of the water resources the iranian officials have recently emphasized the goal of water conservation and water productivity as the binding obligations for the national water resource plans madani 2014 entekhab 2018 without considering the demand side causes of the water shortage supply side policies can only cure the symptoms of the water crisis in the short run rather than in the long run gohari et al 2013 madani 2014 nabavi et al 2017 the zayandeh rud basin one of the most complex basins in central iran is experiencing a severe water shortage the main share of the cultivated area in the basin relies on irrigation the supply of which has experienced drastic reductions in the last decades leading to social unrest iranian agriculture ministry 2018 mohajeri et al 2016 nabavi 2018 currently work is ongoing to implement an integrated water resource management system in the basin mohajeri and horlemann 2017 the uncertainty of water availability is a critical factor for the farming systems within the zayandeh rud basin not knowing when and how much water will be supplied the farmers prepare every year for the cultivation of the available land but if no or not enough water is allocated to the fields all the efforts and expenses e g seed fertilizer are for nothing thus policymakers on the one hand have an urgent need to understand how farmers react to adapt to current and future developments of water resources i e demand side management on the other hand farmers should know about when and how much water is available over the year in order to mitigate the negative externalities of water scarcity i e supply oriented management the present analysis extends the existing literature on water resource management and allocation in two dimensions first many studies have applied mathematical programming approaches to simulate the impacts of annual water shortage particularly in the zayandeh rud basin see e g rezaei et al 2017 anvari et al 2017 ahmadi et al 2018 however water availability not only varies on an annual basis but also over the different months of a year isfahan water authority 2016 it is quite apparent that irrigation water demand water is not equally distributed over the year surprisingly only a little attention has been given to changing the timing of water allocation or water consumption as a policy measure for adapting to water scarcity see karamouz et al 2004 bazargan lari et al 2009 wang et al 2019 changes in the timing of water supply may improve economic productivity evans and sadler 2008 second to our knowledge this is the first study in the literature on water resource management of the zayandeh rud basin using monthly disaggregated positive mathematical programming pmp to investigate water related policies so far pmp has been widely applied in the literature and proved to be a useful approach to investigate water related policies in the agriculture sector e g cortignani and severini 2011 medellin azuara et al 2012 howitt et al 2012 booker et al 2012 graveline and mérel 2014 pmp is the backbone of many agro and hydro economic models regarding water related issues around the world see table a in appendix a the present study applies a modified version of pmp which is able to identify monthly water allocation and monthly water requirements applying pmp based models has several advantages compared with the other applied optimization models in water resource management literature most importantly pmp has been proved to provide more realistic reaction change than similar alternatives like non linear mathematical programming booker et al 2012 lee et al 2019 pmp helps the approach avoid overspecialization due to the corner solution problem merel and howitt 2014 considering the multi faceted of agricultural related policies overspecialization is likely to be an unrealistic solution second pmp exactly reproduces the observed behaviour of farmers i e the crop mix in the base year without adding artificial constraints merel and howitt 2014 gómez limón et al 2016 whereas other types of optimization simulation models i e normative approach require extra subjective constraints in order to make solution close to the status quo gómez limón et al 2016 lee et al 2019 justifying a model which is based on an accurate calibration and a set of a priori constraints is a critical requirement for policy models to be accepted by policymakers merel and howitt 2014 the present study aims to investigate the role of water supply timing in improving irrigation water productivity in one of the most vulnerable districts in the zayandeh rud basin roudasht the most downstream irrigation district in the river basin which is currently faced with a water crisis nikouei and ward 2013 in our analysis we apply a modified version of pmp model to assess how reduced quantities and changes in the timing of water supply influences the choice of crops for cultivation and hence the irrigation water productivity and the farm revenue to do so we defined four scenarios with various annual water shortages and monthly water shortages during peak demand it aims to inform policymakers and public administrations on how farmers can adapt to alternative water supply practices furthermore it seeks to make an important contribution to help farmers cope with possible external challenges and the water resource manager to formalize a robust policy initiative 2 study area the closed semi arid zayandeh rud river basin is one of the most important river basins of iran which provides water for approximately 4 5 million residents and 270 000 ha of agricultural land in central iran schramm and sattary 2014 felmenden 2014 the zayandeh rud river relies substantially on the annual snowfall in the zagros mountains as its source mohajeri et al 2016 the river is regulated by an upstream dam which creates the chadegan reservoir and ends in the ecologically important gavkhuni wetland fig 1 the agricultural sector is the main user of water in the basin using 80 90 of the total water withdrawn of the rest 10 20 is distributed to the industry and household sectors leaving little to none for the gavkhuni wetland gohari et al 2013 raber 2017 the basin has approximately 11 main irrigation networks served by surface water from the zayandeh rud river and ground water in on going work in an iranian german consortium to implement integrated water resource management in the basin hydrological modeling of the complex surface and ground water flows throughout the basin which considers water use in the industrial agricultural and domestic sectors is being developed mohajeri and horlemann 2017 however the modeling is still under development so that only the data on water supply could be used here the focus of the paper here is on the roudasht irrigation network which is the furthest downstream it is located in the east of the province and is divided into two sub regions south and north fig 1 it has been particularly affected by the recent water crisis since the expansion of irrigation facilities in the upper basin has reduced the amount of water supplied to roudasht and gavkhuni wetland downstream molle and mamanpoush 2012 water shortages and water management issues in the roudasht network are in the focus of decision makers at all levels in particular because of its closeness to the water demanding industrial area of the city of isfahan as well as being the last district before the gavkhuni wetland thus in the present study we focused on roudasht district for our case study in the zayandeh rud basin more than 12 500 active farmers work on around 20 000 ha of irrigated land in the roudasht network raber 2017 isfahan agricultural organization 2016 although some dryland farming is practiced in the upper part of the basin due to the highly variable and low annual rainfall in roudasht of around 120 mm a farmers depend on the supply of irrigation water fig 2 shows the annual water inflows to the roudasht irrigation network during the period of 2004 2015 the average was 71 49 mcm however the data reveals that the water supply has been below the average in most years of the last decade moreover the distribution of water within the year varies strongly which shows there has not been a pre determined plan to supply water during different months see fig 3 lack of reliability in irrigation planning often causes more land to be planted than can be irrigated and harvested e g in 2010 half of the cultivated land could not be harvested raber et al 2018 the major crops in the region are wheat and barley followed by alfalfa safflower cotton and vegetables such as beet fig 4 shows the monthly water requirement of major crops in the area this figure demonstrates that the distribution of the water requirement over a year for each crop is quite diverse therefore changing land use can potentially change the total water demand in different months of the year 3 model and methods in this section we elaborate on the process by which our model is applied to analyze water availability scenarios fig 5 shows the conceptual framework used it is based on connecting the demand and supply side for water policy decisions by evaluating the effects such decisions would have on farmers and their revenues through simulation 1 first policy decisions regarding water supply and the agriculture sector are formulated by the government 2 scenarios are made to describe common policy decisions on water availability the four scenarios used in this paper are described in detail in section 3 4 below current resource constraints market and production data are used to describe the baseline case 3 then the reaction of farmers toward water availabilities is simulated by using pmp 4 based on the simulation results for crop mix input use and farm revenue 5 the annual and monthly water demand can be estimated continuing the loop the information from the demand side on the estimated water use provides policymakers with a basis to readjust the water supply for the next period the standard calibration of pmp models is achieved by a procedure in three steps cortignani and severini 2011 medellin azuara et al 2012 howitt et al 2012 as follow 3 1 step 1 base linear model we first specify a linear optimization problem subject to two types of constraints the regular resource constraints and calibration constraints the structure of pmp in our analysis is given by 1 m a x x s i z s i p i y

a s i j and c s i j respectively indicate leontief coefficients and the unit cost of input j land irrigation labor machinery fertilizers for crop i and irrigation system s as in previous literature we assume water and land are the dominant constraints and they must be allocated optimally across alternative crops cortignani and severini 2011 medellin azuara et al 2012 accordingly eq 2 represents land constraint with tol as total agricultural land use in the case study as laid out above as a modification of our model we specify eqs 3 and 4 to capture monthly and annual water use in these constraints w u s i m and t w m are the water requirement of crop i irrigation system s and monthly water available in month m respectively we also define eq 4 to ensure that the sum of monthly water use is less than the annual water available i e taw a calibration constraint on land use will be included to find the unique dual shadow prices for each crop activities under different irrigation system i e λ s i medellin azuara et al 2012 as detailed in howitt 1995 the shadow values of calibration constraint are the cornerstone to the subsequent calibration process the aim of the first step is to predict the shadow price of calibration constraint to be used in the next step 3 2 step 2 yield parameter estimation with maximum entropy step two aims to estimate reproduce parameters for a quadratic pmp yield function using the shadow price i e lagrange multiplier obtained from the calibration constraints in eq 5 medellin azuara et al 2012 we specify a quadratic yield function as follow 6 n y s i α s i j n x s i j β s i j n x s i j 2 n o n l i n e a r y i e l d f u n c t i o n where α s i j and β s i j indicate intercept and slope of non linear yield function and n x s i j denotes the amount of input i used in crop j and irrigation system s despite α s i j β s i j is a symmetric positive semidefinite matrix which is difficult to be recovered paris and howitt 1998 estimation of slope matrix i e β s i j by using shadow prices i e λ s i from the first step and the vector of realized input output information yields an ill posed problem this problem is not solvable by the traditional econometric approach following paris and howitt 1998 and howitt and msangi 2006 2014 we apply the maximum entropy technique 1 1 maximum entropy has some advantages compared to other alternatives for more detail see paris and howitt 1998 howitt and msangi 2014 and howitt and msangi 2019 to estimate reproduce the parameters of non linear yield function 3 3 step 3 non linear calibrated model in the third step the following non linear quadratic objective function is plugged into the linear model and the calibration land constraint is removed 7 m a x n x s i j nl z s i j α

for crop i and irrigation system s the calibrated nonlinear model including eqs 7 2 4 is able to recover the base year information without adding calibration constraints besides the quadratic objective function of the final model is useful to avoid overspecialization solution and thereby the final calibrated model is more flexible to simulate policy changes lee et al 2019 policies entailing limited water availability either on a monthly basis or annually require changing the right hand sides of water constraints in eqs 3 and 4 we first determine the baseline situation reproduced by the calibrated model according to the land use in the reference year 2015 the calibrated model is run and the resulting distribution of water demand is taken as the baseline the model was run using the gams software the input data for the model including crop prices crop yields input requirements input prices and the current land use as the baseline was partly collected by the survey from local farmers within the basin the coefficients and parameters gathered include monthly water requirement per hectare machinery use cost per hour labor use fertilizer including nitrate and phosphate requirement per hectare and chemical use per hectare for all crops according to the criteria crop diversification the samples were divided into two clusters of less diversified farms cultivating 3 or less crops and more diversified farms cultivating more than 3 crops the land use of each farm type was calculated according to the average of samples of land use in each class appendix b displays the characteristics of each type of farm including average land use and crop yields besides the data on total land use was calculated according to the agriculture organization of isfahan agriculture organization of isfahan aoi 2015 dataset for the crop year of 2014 2015 the validity of data was assessed by comparing with other data set and also expert views further data was provided by official statistic institutes including aoi fao data on the crop yield respond function and agricultural support service co and regional water authority and ministry of energy 3 4 scenario development making decisions about water supply and distribution from the reservoir to the irrigation network during different months is a challenging issue for the managers of the water authorities in the zayandeh rud basin some experts have suggested that reallocating the water supply over the year may result in higher water productivity of agricultural production in the zayandeh rud basin by allowing farmers to react to alternative water supply practices nikouei and ward 2013 gohari et al 2014 redesigning the allocation of water may lead to reduced water use in some months of the year the saved water could be used to cover the water demands of crops during other months of the year when the water supply is more critical and consequently support farmers in the basin to react and adapt to drought conditions the effects of two possible approaches to reducing water supply were investigated in this study in the first approach a planned cut to the water supply in the month of the peak water demand was simulated as fig 6 illustrates the peak water demand for agricultural crop production in roudasht is often centered in the month of may the historical data fig 3 shows that water supply in may has varied in the last years within a broad range of between 10 to 23 mcm the water demand in may calculated for the baseline year on the basis of the crop production is 24 94 mcm fig 7 moreover during april and may competition among water users agriculture industry and household in the basin is particularly high due to increasing average temperature and decreasing rainfall in these months based on this information we considered alternative water supply scenarios for addressing the imbalance between the actual water supply and the desirable water supply in may from the perspective of crop production in the first two scenarios s1p20 and s2p40 a limitation in the water supply in may is simulated by limiting the water supply in that month t w m in the equation 8 to 80 s1p20 and 60 s2p40 of the water demand in the baseline scenario fig 6a however competition for water between the agricultural sector and other water users such as the industry sector and private households is not limited to certain months in the year but takes place throughout the whole year therefore we investigated a set of scenarios where the limitation of the water supply is not set monthly s3a20 and s4a40 but annually s3a20 and s4a40 simulate a limitation of the annual water supply for irrigation of agricultural crops to 80 and 60 of the total water annual demand in the baseline scenario fig 6b overall four scenarios were defined as follows scenario s1p20 limiting the water supply in may to 80 of the baseline water demand i e reducing the water supply for irrigation during may by at least 20 compared to the baseline water demand scenario s2p40 limiting the water supply in may to 60 of the baseline water demand i e reducing the water supply for irrigation during may by at least 40 compared to the baseline water demand scenario s3a20 limiting the water supply within a year to 80 of the baseline water demand i e reducing the water supply for irrigation within a year by at least 20 compared to the baseline water demand scenario s4a40 limiting the water supply within a year to 60 of the baseline water demand i e reducing the water supply for irrigation within a year by at least 40 compared to the baseline water demand the impacts of these four scenarios are examined separately for two clusters of farms i e one cluster with more diversified farms with more than 4 crops and one with less diversified farms with less than 4 crops in the farm this clustering was made to take into consideration different capacities for adaptation based on the diversity of cropping activities the average agricultural land size of the less diversified farms is smaller than that of the diversified farms we also analyze the implications of water supply scenarios on the land cropped by the farms in total to provide a more aggregated view of the total crop production in the basin 4 results and discussion in this section we present the results of the scenario simulations on changing the cultivation area of crops total water use and water productivity indices gross margin and agricultural employment the analysis shows the results are very farm type dependent therefore after discussing the results aggregated for all farms in the total irrigation district area the results for the two typical farm clusters i e diversified farms and less diversified farms are discussed individually 4 1 overview of all farms in general agricultural land use decreases in all scenarios when the water supply is reduced either in total or in the peak month the percentage change in the total cultivated area for each crop in the study area declines as a result of parameter changes in the four scenarios described in sections 3 2 fig 7 this is critical in view of the overall policy goal in iran to maintain production levels high and attain self sufficiency in food production however a reduction in the cultivated area does not necessarily mean production must decrease the results show that the percentage change in land use between the different scenarios varies the limitation of the water supply during the peak month of may scenario s1p20 and s2p40 results in a reduction in land for all crops though the reductions in the land used for wheat and barley are higher it explicitly shows that the production of wheat and barley is highly affected by water supply in may in contrast the results of the scenarios s3a20 and s4a40 show that the land used for cotton beet and alfalfa cultivation decreases over proportionally when the water supply reduction is not limited to a specific period of time within the year the land cultivated with wheat and barley decreases less in s3a20 and s4a40 than for the other crops due to their lower water requirements the timing of a reduction in the water supply may impact the land use allocation and production structure this offers some scope to decision makers and farmers to well aligned water supply and agricultural land use the findings displayed in table 1 demonstrate that the limitation of water supply in all scenarios results in different cropping patterns that are characterized by lower water use compared to the baseline scenario the reduction in water use is similar to the reduction in the water supply in all scenarios however the production does not decrease proportionally to the reduction in water use and water supply in the scenarios while water use is reduced by 18 8 and 37 9 in the scenarios s1p20 and s2p40 production only decreases by 9 4 in the scenario s1p20 and by 21 in the scenario s2p40 the physical water productivity pwp defined as the ratio of the fresh mass of production to water use kg m3 increased for both scenarios by 11 and 27 the same is true for the other two scenarios s3a20 and s4a40 economic water productivity ewp is defined by molden et al 2010 as the value gross margin derived per unit of water m3 used in our analysis we focus on ewp as the appropriate indicator since it considers not only the crop yield but also the variable costs of production the results in fig 8 show that ewp increases when the water supply is limited the increase in ewp is higher when the water supply is limited in the peak month of may only the increase in ewp is less pronounced when the water supply is not limited to a specific month or period of time within the year limiting water supply in the month of may can contribute to an increase in the average gross margin derived per unit of water the changes in agricultural gross margin and agricultural employment in the short run as shown in table 1 are indicators of changes in the farmer s and rural community s revenues the decreasing land use due to water supply reductions results in a short term decrease in the labor requirements for agricultural activities a trend confirmed by the simulation results in table 1 however under s1p20 the percentage reduction in agricultural employment is less than the percentage reduction in irrigation water supply and the percentage reduction in the cultivated land even a decrease in agricultural employment as a reduction in the water supply seems inevitable the impact on employment can be lessened by limiting the water supply in the peak month of may only fig 9 shows the monthly water distribution calculated by the model in the four scenarios as it was explained above limiting water supply in may leads to the reallocation of the water towards crops with lower water requirement in may consequently this scenario changes annual land use and crop production which consequently result in changes of the water demand in the other months of the year water demand changes in may are more pronounced in the scenarios s1p20 and s2p40 compared to s3p20 and s4p40 in contrast water demand changes more in other months of the year in the scenarios s3p20 and s4p40 compared to the scenarios s1p20 and s2p40 except in the months of november and april this may have some implications for the utilization of infrastructure and the public perception of water supply limitations 4 2 less diversified farms the percentage changes shown in fig 10 in crop cultivation of the farms with less diversified crop production indicate for the scenario s1p20 more pronounced changes in land used for wheat 25 1 followed by barley 14 4 and alfalfa 3 7 by decreasing water supply in may scenarios s1p20 and s2p40 the area under wheat and barley decreases drastically while the area under alfalfa decreases only slightly additionally in the scenarios s3a20 and s4a40 the area under alfalfa and barley decreases more compared with wheat this is due to the lower water productivity and higher water requirements of alfalfa and barley as a result certain activities and related value chains like animal husbandry based on alfalfa as forage may be more affected by a water supply reduction especially in the case of less diversified farms and if the water supply is reduced throughout the year in the farms with less diversified crop production a limitation of the water supply in the month of may has a similar impact on total land use and annual water use as if the water supply is limited to no specific month or period of time within the year table 2 the reductions in gross margin total production and employment are disproportionally lower than the reduction in the water supply this indicates that there is some scope for improvement in terms of economic water productivity the reduction in water and land use leads to decreases in agricultural production gross margin and input uses table 2 the decrease in production is lower than the reduction in land and water usage which indicates that farmers are able to compensate the impact of reduced water and land inputs by increasing the productivity of water and land and still produce the same output fig 11 also confirms that both ewp and pwp increase as water supply is reduced water productivity is slightly higher under s1p20 and s2p40 compared with s3a20 and s4a40 resulting in a preference for reducing the supply of water in the peak month of may only the cropping pattern changes due to decreasing water supply in may by 20 lead to changes in water demand in other months especially in january february march and april in these months the difference in water demand is less pronounced between a water supply reduction in the peak month may only compared to a water supply reduction with no specific month or period of time within the year in all other months water demand tends to be lower in the case of a reduction in water demand with no specific month or period of time within the year 4 3 more diversified farms and different irrigation systems the changes in the crop areas of more diversified farms in the four scenarios show similar to the case of less diversified farms that both a moderate and a stronger limitation of the water supply in the month of may s1p20 and s2p40 leads to decreased areas under alfalfa wheat and barley fig 13 the scenarios also result in a minor increase in the areas under cotton and beet with a reduction in the water supply in may of at least 40 the areas under all crops decline among the crops the land under barley and wheat decreases significantly due to the low water productivity of both crops as a result water supply reductions may lead to an increase in the cultivated area of certain crops in more diversified farms if water supply reductions are moderate more diversified farms have the means to overcompensate the impact of a reduced water supply by expanding the areas of crops with higher economic water productivities in the more diversified farms two different types of irrigation systems are being employed pressurized irrigation with higher efficiency and furrow flood irrigation with lower efficiency see appendix b the technical and economic coefficients of the two irrigation systems are significantly different therefore the cropping activities in the model were formulated in a disaggregated way including the two irrigation systems and their technical and economic coefficients for analyzing the distinct impacts on farms with different irrigation systems as fig 14 shows in a drought situation or limitation of water supply the area under pressurized irrigation system decreases less than the area under furrow technology this finding is in line with other studies in iran showing that water scarcity motivates farmers to implement efficient irrigation systems by replacing furrow irrigation zamani 2012 also under scenario s1p20 the percentage change in pressurized irrigation increases slightly this means that reduced water supply in the month of may can result in farmers favoring pressurized irrigation over furrow irrigation however due to technical constraints in particular the salinity of the water available for irrigation expanding pressurized irrigation systems should be considered carefully in any policy recommendations the total land use decreases due to a reduction in the water supply in all scenarios table 3 the reduction in total land and water use in more diversified farms is notably lower than the reductions in land and water use in less diversified farms this result calls for a differentiated approach for managing the water supply to more and less diversified farms it is also an argument for supporting diversification strategies for farms in the region the summary statistics for the changes in agricultural gross margin depict that the level of losses in gross margins increases as water availabilities monthly and annual decrease especially in the scenario s4a40 the results suggest that with respect to the baseline s1p20 requires the lowest and s4a40 scenarios require the lowest and the highest gm compensations by 0 51 and 2 3 2 2 it is computed by subtracting gm s4a40 gm baseline 9 63 11 95 2 32 thousand euro respectively fewer workers are employed in crop production as a result of decreasing land use due to water supply changes consequently the number of required workers decreases which is confirmed by the results in table 3 just like other sample groups less inputs are used water land and labor and less agricultural products are produced however in the more diversified farms the ewp in s1p20 and s2p40 is slightly lower than in s3a20 ands4a40 fig 15 this finding may be related to different cropping patterns and different water requirement over the year the result points towards a preference of more diversified farms for limiting the water supply without a limitation in a specific month or period in the year compared to the less diversified farms see fig 12 during spring and summer more water is demanded by the farmers with more diversified cropping patterns fig 16 just like other sample groups cropping pattern changes due to water supply limitation in may which again leads to changing water demand in other months as shown in fig 16 in addition any limitations in water supply in may have a substantial impact on water demand in february march and april whereas it has minor impacts on the water use during summer i e june july and august these results indicate the more diversified farms have a different pattern of adaptation to water supply reductions compared to less diversified farms water demand changes are less pronounced when farm have more options of crops for cultivation 5 conclusion and policy implications this paper investigates the impacts on agricultural production of various water conservation scenarios using different timings in water supply in the roudasht irrigation network of the zayandeh rud basin in iran to this end we use an agro economic model to compare the impacts of two types of water supply restrictions including 1 a limitation of water supply in the peak demand month of may within the dry season of the year and 2 a limitation of water supply distributed over the month of the year the impacts modeled include changes in land allocation for crop production total water and land use water productivity of the total cropped area economic water productivity employment and total production these impacts were analyzed separately for two groups of farms i e more diversified and less diversified farms as argued by wang et al 2019 findings show that water supply management should consider reducing the water supply in different timing periods of the year in a planned way the results for the roudasht irrigation network indicate that limiting water supply during the dry season where water demand is highest i e in the peak water demand month of may leads to a decrease in the total cultivated agricultural land a similar impact was found when reducing water supply throughout the year however the economic impacts measured as ewp economic water productivity are different when water supply reductions take place throughout the year or only within a specific period of time in the year i e during the dry season these findings are in line with evans and sadler 2008 who showed that adjusting the timing of water supply may lead to increased regional net economic returns further differences were found regarding the impact caused by targeted water supply reductions on land allocation and shares of single crops in the cultivated area the agricultural area cropped with wheat and barley decreases more than that of other crops which reflects the high sensitivity of these crops towards a reduced water supply in may the potential effects of water supply reductions and timing vary in the case of more diversified and less diversified farms even the land used for wheat cultivation decreases comparatively more than that of other crops in both farm types as a consequence of water supply reductions and timing our findings also indicate that the impact of limiting the water supply in may on the farm revenue is less pronounced in more diversified farms than in less diversified farms farmers in more diversified farms cultivate various crops with different monthly water requirements and therefore they have more options to adjust in case of a limitation of the water supply for the case of annual water supply limitation without specification of the timing crops with a higher annual water requirement are reduced more relative to wheat and barley which have a lower water requirement if farmers are aware of the targeted reduction of water supply in the peak demand period they may e g adapt by decreasing the share of crops in the rotation which has higher water requirement during that specific time period in general negative changes in performance parameters resulting from decreasing the water supply in the month of may were more pronounced in the less diversified farms compared to the more diversified farms the scope of adaptation to water supply reductions is assumed to be more limited in the case of less diversified farms compared to more diversified farms therefore our results indicate that robustness against water shortage and irregular water supply may be increased through diversification of crop production an implication of these results for the policy is to remove measures that limit a free crop selection by farmers this is closely related to the recommendation expressed by some authors not to push policywise the production of certain crops for self sufficiency like wheat and others gohari et al 2013 madani et al 2016 such policies may reduce the scope for adaptation to water supply reduction by giving preference to some crops with lower water productivity against others with higher productivity instead increasing the scope of adaptation by encouraging higher diversity in the selection of crops may contribute to reducing water demand while reducing the negative economic impact at the farm level of water supply limitation our findings have several important policy implications for managing water resources in line with previous literature e g gohari et al 2013 boazar et al 2019 our results indicate that advance planning and coordination of water management and especially water supply in accordance with water requirement at farm level can help to adapt and reduce physical and economic losses from water supply limitations the results underline the findings from gohari et al 2013 madani 2014 nabavi et al 2017 and hadizadeh et al 2018 that formulating supply oriented measures without scrutinizing demand side management options is an incomplete water policy design top down water supply management practices need to be replaced or complemented by bottom up practices considering the conditions at the farm level hadizadeh et al 2018 the success of water management practices highly depends on the willingness to accept and adapt by farmers boazar et al 2019 the reaction of farmers towards different water availability scenarios should be considered in policy evaluation our analysis highlights the importance of predictable water availability for effective water conservation policy by announcing the water supply plan in advance understanding how farmers behave and respond to water availability and water supply timing are crucial to estimating the potential irrigation water demand in a specific season or in total in order to implement such policy in practice the maximum and minimum of water availability with reasonable likelihoods needs to be determined for the agricultural sector in advance changes in the land use cropping pattern and monthly water requirements in response to a change in the water supply can be estimated using agro economic modeling on a regional scale adaptation plans and compensation schemes for cases of water shortage can be designed according to the model based estimates of seasonal water demand farmers suffering from water shortages and subsequent yield losses frequently demand some type of compensation measures that allows them to continue in farming appraisals of economic losses can be used as proxies to determine the level of compensation required for different types of farmers well aligned water supply practices can contribute to reducing the need for such compensatory measures if the farmers adapt their cropping patterns accordingly this study basically focused on timing and reduced water supply in terms of their impacts on agricultural land use the input uses and farm revenue further aspects that affect farmer revenues and their ability to adapt are not only the quantity of water delivered but also the quality of the water salinization of the soil is a major concern in water scarce areas and farmers often resort to reusing of brackish water from irrigation drainage canals and shallow groundwater layers inadequate water supply hinders salt leaching measures in the case study as we do not have detailed information on the irrigation water reuse and water quality we cannot disentangle these effects in our empirical study thus future research is recommended to incorporate the impacts of water quality and irrigation water reuse in the empirical model considering water quality is especially relevant in case farmers utilize shallow wells to extract irrigation water since this tends to be more polluted with residues from plant protection and fertilization other limitations of the present study are a the water supply timing at basin level could provide more information about the inter regional water transfer over different months b our model can be extended to include monthly water deficit c future plans are to combine the pmp model with the hydrological model being developed for the basin in order to estimate effects of policy changes and d the applicability of water supply restrictions should be validated using participatory modeling techniques conflict of interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary material
