dimensionless γ range 1 introduction industrial solvents are chemical compounds used for dissolution and dilution of components used in the manufacture of goods azaarenes like 2 methylpyridine are nitroaromatics found in textile and pharmaceutical wastewater the two largescale manufacturing industries wastewaters from animal husbandry farms including poultry have also shown the presence of 2mp since it is used as a solvent in coccidiostats manufacture 1 2mp is used as a solvent in dyeing and rinsing baths of cotton compounds with 2mp pass completely unaltered through the conventional activated sludge processes of biological treatment due to non mineralization of refractory organics and poor bod removal 2 while one time exposure to low concentrations of 2mp 0 5 mg l 1 does not bio magnify repeated exposure to 2mp contaminated waters can lead to the bio accumulation of the neurotoxin in turn leading to endocrine disrupting activity and multiple organ failure in humans 3 acute exposure can lead to suppression of central nervous system severe depression and physical exhaustion 4 thus there arises the need to curb the presence of 2mp from waterbodies methylpyridine concentration of 12 26 mg l 1 has been found in coking wastewaters although a concentration lesser than 1 mg l 1 is recommended by the industry 5 wastewater from tar plants was recorded to compose of a high concentration of 2mp in the range of 54 140 mg l 1 6 for industrial workers a threshold limit value of 15 mg m 3 has been set for 2mp exposure on a daily basis 2mp is poorly degraded in the natural environment and its removal is made harder because it bears no net charges 7 8 it is pertinent to restrict the discharge of 2mp bearing wastewaters into subsurface water sources a concentration limit of 0 316 mg l 1 and 1 mg l 1 has been set in this regard by the us epa and the uk standards for heterocyclic bases another finding showed that even 0 5 mg l 1 of 2mp in waterbodies is enough to make fishes unsuitable for human consumption 3 the indian central pollution control board cpcb india addresses this point by labelling pyridinic pollutants as dangerous odorous nuisances in water classes sw i and sw ii regarding marine and coastal outfalls it also advises against presence of these pollutants in ecologically sensitive zones and bath waters 9 literature on 2mp removal focuses on removal of high concentration 100 500 mg l 1 of 2mp from aqueous solutions 7 8 such low volume high concentration lv hc discharge of 2mp is observed from industries where 2mp is used as a primary chemical component in manufacture for e g pharmaceuticals for textile industries utilizing 2mp as a solvent with a high volume low concentration discharge hv lc designing a lv hc system with a high safety coefficient is unnecessary resulting in over utilization of a large volume of adsorbent 8 10 this in turn leads to production of a large footprint of spent adsorbent drastically increasing hazards associated with disposal prior to conceptualization of this study hplc analysis of freshly discharged treated dye house effluent from a textile industry detected the presence of 2mp it was found to contain 2mp in concentrations greater than the recommended limit this finding is of concern because in developing and under developed countries textile plants of capacities greater than 1000 m3 per day consistently discharge effluents into storm drains that lead them directly to local water bodies government policies focus primarily on lv hc 2mp concentrations whilst not considering hv lc systems thus creating an exploitable loophole this study involving removal of hv lc 2mp concentrations from simulated synthetic solutions is thus of importance researchers have attempted to remove azaarenic alkylpyridines by the application of adsorptive methods using coconut shells amorphous silicon dioxide jordanian zeolites and kaolin 7 8 10 all of these materials require high adsorbent doses for the treatment of 2mp which in turn leads to production of a large volume of spent adsorbent 11 the large footprint of the spent adsorbent is hazardous to dispose of into landfills because of the greater surface area available for leaching of previously adsorbed species activated carbon is also structurally weak further increasing risk of structural disintegration and fouling 12 thus the need for development of an improved adsorbent with low dosage better performance and structural stability was felt new age sorbents like graphene nanocomposites have shown great promise in this field and their utilization in uptake of refractory industrial solvents has been lacking in literature 13 high adsorptive capacities have been observed in graphene based nanomaterials which contain sp2 hybridized carbon atoms as building blocks of honey comb like structures similar to fullerenes and carbon nanotubes 14 17 applications for similar products have been observed in electrochemical sensors with high selectivity towards a given species 18 21 electronics medicine and contamination curtailment 22 25 as an adsorbent graphene oxide has shown great potential in removal of emerging organic contaminants like nitroaromatics tetracyclines antibiotics and dyes 26 28 apart from having a hydrophobic effect on organic pollutants the presence of a π π interaction between the graphene oxide structure and an organic toxicant molecule results in their removal from solution 29 30 graphene nanoparticles have shown an ability to exhibit high theoretical exposed surface area 2620 m2 g 1 although a loss in observed surface area to 300 1000 m2 g 1 has been reported 31 35 to counteract the effect of accretion in graphene oxide the process of exfoliation is used to separate the layers by mechanical chemical or thermal means 36 graphene has displayed affinity towards functionalization 37 when functionalized it has shown remarkable capacity for sorption of toxic pollutants 38 carboxylic functionalization of exfoliated graphene oxide nanocomposite results in a mono layer of highly oxidized structure bearing carboxylic and hydroxylic functional group in the basal plane this has been known to increase efficiency of organic pollutant adsorption it is also reported to improve alignment of gon sheets in crystallites that helps in control of crystallite size better thermal control in gon synthesis also preserves structural integrity of basal planes of gon layers thermal control also helps to drastically make the synthesis process of graphene oxide safe with minimization of exothermicity of the reaction and so2 emission the use of carboxyl graphene has been very limited in industrial effluent extraction 39 optimal utilization of the sorbent is of prime importance for its conservation reuse and disposal in real life situations impact of factor interactions on removal efficiency of the sorbent hold greater importance than single factor batch studies these objectives are realized by mathematical modelling of sorption by the process of design of experiments doe analyzing the impact of each controllable factor affecting adsorption 40 41 full factorial method lays excessive stress on each individual factor interaction resulting in large number of experiments fractional factorial on the other hand is unable to gauge factor interactions with precision 42 another hindrance is the usage of a fixed number of levels per factor even though each factor affects adsorption to a different degree experimental data optimization by non linear doehlert design was thus deemed appropriate since it combines fewer experimental runs with relatively low error in output prediction and employs varying number of levels for each factor depending upon their impact on adsorption 43 in this study 2mp removal by gon was optimized by using doehlert design matrix formulation which utilizes uniform distribution of experimental points chosen from the predetermined four factor dd matrix 44 the predicted results from the developed mathematical model were corroborated by results of batch studies response surfaces and contours were plotted for visualization of multi factor effects on removal these studies establish gon as an effective adsorptive media with great potential in industrial solvent treatment this study was conducted to i detect the solvent 2mp in treated industrial effluent samples ii synthesize the advanced adsorbent exfoliated carboxyl graphene oxide nanocomposite and achieve thermal control in graphene oxide synthesis iii compare the sorption capacity adsorption mechanism and structural stability of gon with activated carbon sac for uptake of 2mp at low concentrations 2 5 20 mg l 1 and iv optimize the adsorption process by 4 factor doehlert design matrix for understanding single factor and interaction effects 2 experimental section 2 1 materials gon was synthesized in the laboratory along with all associated reagents reported elsewhere 45 2 methylpyridine was procured from sigma aldrich chemical co missouri usa sac was obtained from central drug house india ammonium hydroxide nh4oh graphite powder potassium permanganate kmno4 concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 orthophosphoric acid h3po4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and chloroacetic acid c2h3clo2 were obtained from merck germany textile dye house wastewater containing 2mp was procured from a 1500 m3 per day capacity plant situated in howrah district w b india 2 2 pre cooled synthesis of exfoliated carboxylic graphene oxide nanocomposite the initial ingredients used for making graphene oxide were referred to from modified hummers method 45 46 the hummers preparation process is extremely exothermic and partly explosive leading to expulsion of heat and highly toxic fumes thermal control is a vital process in ensuring safe synthesis of gon graphite powder with fine spherical particles was used in the synthesis for better exfoliation and high exposed surface area for carboxylization a 9 1 mixture of concentrated h2so4 h3po4 180 20 ml was prepared producing a slight exotherm of 323 k the mix was cooled to 283 k prior to addition of graphite powder 1 5 g 1 wt equiv and kmno4 6 wt equiv a very tame reaction was observed with the temperature rising to 303 k when this step was conducted without pre cooling of the acid mix an explosive reaction occurred with profuse so2 emission the reaction was stirred for 1 h and maintained at 293 k using an ice bath the ice bath was intermittently removed and continuous stirring was provided for 12 h at 328 k the reaction was cooled to room temperature and poured onto ice 400 ml with 30 h2o2 2 ml the brown coloured graphene oxide nanoparticles were allowed to settle and the excess supernatant was decanted then evaporated the graphene oxide nanoparticles were washed repeatedly with double distilled water on a whatman 42 filter paper then with 200 ml of 0 1 n naoh for ph neutralization carboxylic functionalization was undertaken by gradual addition of 0 03 m of naoh and 0 01 m of c2h3clo2 to the gon precipitate followed by mixing for 3 h fig s1 centrifugation of the gon suspension was carried out pr24 remi instruments at 4000 rpm for 4 h followed by washing the gon suspension was then washed in an efficient manner firstly using 30 hcl and ethanol to remove impurities and then using ddw this washing was again performed on a whatman 42 grade filter paper without multiple replacements leading to reuse of chemical reagents gon was then exfoliated by sonicating for 2 h and annealing it at 673 k for 2 h this exfoliated graphene was more perceptive to the effects of carboxylic functionalization 2 3 characterization the sorbents were characterized by different instrumental analyses to understand their physico chemical properties ftir ft ir 4700 jasco study was used for functional group determination and tentative reaction mechanism determination scanning electron microscopy sem joel6380a jeol ltd equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was used to define surface morphologies and chemical composition proximate analysis was carried out as per is 1350 1 1984 to understand physical characteristics of the sorbents the ph associated with the point of zero charge phzc of the sorbents was found using ph drift method 47 average particle size of sac was found by using gradation analysis for determining nanoscale crystallite particle size of gon x ray diffraction xrd vortex me7 hitachi with cuk α λ 1 54056 nm radiation was used stability of gon was tested under operating conditions by i measuring leaching of protons from the carboxyl groups on gon into solution in the optimum batch operating ph range of 5 7 and ii understanding thermal stability for estimating ph stability 200 ml ddw solutions with ph 5 6 and 7 were prepared gon 2 g l 1 was added to each solution and the solution ph was measured after stirring each system for 48 h at 400 rpm the gon was centrifuged and filtered out of the solution and ph of the filtrate was measured thermal stability under practical use was tested by checking the weight loss in a sample of gon in air using a muffle furnace with respect to every 10 k rise in temperature in the range of 298 k 498 k acid base titrimetric method was used to find the isoelectric point of 2mp solutions 0 01 m of both naoh and hcl were taken along with 20 mg l 1 of 2mp solution in the flask as sample a blank run was performed for charge variation detection potential was measured using the ph meter in mv mode ph 700 eutech instruments for biodegradability studies of 2mp cod cr 3200 digester wtw was used 2 4 2mp detection the uhplc used for detection of 2mp in effluent and synthetic samples ultimate 3000 thermo scientific was fitted with a hypersil gold 4 6 250 mm 5μm column a 55 45 eluent ratio of acetonitrile to hplc grade water was found to give the best peak characteristics when used at a flow rate 0 5 ml min 1 and an injection volume of 1 μl with the temperature set to 303 k and the detection wavelength to 262 nm λmax of 2mp in the uv region the time of detection of 2mp was found to be 7 4 min the system was calibrated by using 2mp concentrations in the range of 1 100 mg l 1 the industrial effluent was diluted multiple times before using in the hplc 2 5 2mp removal study batch equilibrium sorption studies were conducted to test the sorption efficiencies of gon and sac stock solutions of 2mp with concentration 1000 ppm were prepared in ddw a series of 50 ml stoppered borosil conical flasks were taken for batch studies and filled to the brim to prevent gas accumulation for the sorption experiments the flasks were half filled with ddw sorbent was then added and sonicated for 15 min for proper particle dissipation 2mp was added and ddw was filled to brim all experiments were carried out at room temperature 303 1 k unless mentioned otherwise aliquots were extracted and post sorption 2mp concentration was determined by the process mentioned in section 2 6 equilibrium sorbent dosage m ph ph0 contact time t initial 2mp concentration c0 and temperature t studies were completed 48 2mp solutions of 5 mg l 1 were studied unless specified separately the prepared samples were agitated at 150 rpm for the determined equilibrium time the initial ph values of aqueous solutions were kept near the natural ph of 2mp around 7 0 5 which consequently was also the ph that showed maximum removal permutations of initial 2mp loading and sorbent dosing were analysed to check the variation in sorbent efficiency optimum value of each parameter obtained from a particular set of batch studies was carried forward to the next set of experiments conducted for the following parameter specifically for dosage study the sorbent dosage was varied from 0 5 3 g l 1 for gon and 2 20 g l 1 for sac optimal adsorbent dose for 2mp removal was determined subsequently studies on ph were conducted by changing ph from 2 to 12 with increments of 2 units the required solution ph 2 12 was attuned by adding minute amounts of 1 n h2so4 and 0 1 n naoh solution using a ph meter contact time studies were conducted up to 240 min prior to which both sorbent systems had achieved equilibrium a temperature range of 293 k 313 k was considered for temperature studies and a concentration range of 2 5 20 mg l 1 of 2mp was studied for initial toxicant studies 2 6 sample analyses post sorption of 2mp onto sac and gon 10 ml samples were drawn and centrifugally separated from the sorbents followed by filtration through whatman grade 42 filter paper the 2mp filtrates obtained were then analysed to determine the 2mp concentration spectrophotometrically with the help of the double beam uv vis spectrophotometer 2203 systronics a wavelength of 262 nm was used for analysis to understand the significance of adsorbate loss during analyses blank 2mp solutions were prepared and examined the losses were found to be insignificant with an average absorbance error of 0 001 to insure data quality assurance and reproducibility all the experiments were conducted in duplicate and averages were noted fresh 2mp stock and samples were prepared for each study and analysis instruments were recalibrated if needed all glass apparatuses were acid washed cleansed and oven dried prior to use 2 7 doehlert design four factors chosen for analysis with their chosen range of values were ph 4 10 m 1 2 g l 1 c0 5 20 mg l 1 and t 293 308 k importance of each factor was gauged from batch studies and number of levels to each were assigned accordingly with larger number of levels indicating better resolution the dd matrix was prepared from the simplex table represented by first 5 rows of table 1 a 2d simplex is visualized as an isosceles triangle with unit length sides pivoted at the center the entire dd matrix is derived from the simplex by permutative subtraction of each corner from the pivoting point 43 a 4d matrix is harder to physically represent but may be mathematically expressed as an extension of lower level simplexes of dimension d 1 44 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 6 1 2 d 1 d 2 1 2 d d 1 d 1 2 d number of factors f influence the number of experimental runs n in accordance with the relation n f f 1 1 a dd model was developed consisting of linear and squared factor terms along with linear interaction effects 49 dd utilizes uniform shell design which suggests the uniform distribution of factor values in each experimental run reducing the number of experimental runs required in model development experimental runs were conducted in duplicate according to the design matrix in batch mode by assuming equilibration at t 90 min the 2mp removal percentages obtained were fit into a model equation of the form 50 2 removal r o i 1 4 a i x i i 1 4 b i x i 2 i j 1 4 c i j x i x j ε i j 100 where r0 ai bi and cij are regression coefficients and εij is the prediction error the yield obtained from the model is the removal of 2mp the dd design experimental 2mp removal dd predicted removal and model error are given in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbing materials the physico chemical properties of average particle size proximate analysis parameters and phzc for gon and sac are listed in table 2 gon showed higher fixed carbon content along with lower composition of other entities the phzc were found to lie in the acidic region with phzc gon phzc sac upon analysing other recorded studies of phzc of graphene oxide 51 52 while one study reported a similar phzc value another reported a lower phzc this difference in results could be attributed to the degree of washing and ph neutralization of the adsorbents post synthesis and prior to use in batch studies the use of strong acids in the synthesis process for activation and exfoliation of the adsorbents lowers the ph of the surface of the adsorbent directly affecting the results obtained for phzc scanning electron microscopy sem image of sac in fig 1 a shows macropores and certain mesopores of sac high surface irregularity is indicated by the presence of higher contrast in the image with bright and darker regions fig 1 b shows these pores densely coated with a dull smooth and uniform layer of the loaded 2mp which is indicated by circled region 2 virgin gon fig 1 c has a greasy looking gon layer with sprinkled particles on the surface showing successful exfoliation and composite formation region 1 shows one such composite particle of gon with particle size 2 μm sizes up to 0 5 μm were resolvable as bright spots in the image these particles stick to the parent particle via van der waals forces and form rough undulations gon coated with 2mp fig 1 d has a smooth texture with slight plateaus and coated gon particles which appear like granules in region 3 an observation reported by nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis suggests that activated carbon is mostly a microporous sorbent while gon employs both micropores and macropores 29 ftir study was conducted on both the sorbents in virgin and 2mp loaded conditions the presence of a trough at wavenumber 3406 cm 1 in both virgin gon vg and 2mp loaded gon lg represents strong and broad intermolecularly bonded oh group possibly due to the presence of moisture content the trough at 3012 cm 1 in vg is replaced by a smaller one at 3010 cm 1 in lg representing an oh bond of a cooh group there is also an attenuation in trough depth from vg to lg representing a reduction in free cooh groups present and cleavage in the oh bond this along with a simultaneous disappearance of alcohol groups oh phenolic 1339 cm 1 and c oh primary alcohol 1063 cm 1 from the vg spectrum were an indication to the change in the virgin gon structure on loading with 2mp these functional groups corroborates to gon structures previously proposed 53 as shown in fig 2 the dampened carboxylic acid and disappearing alcohol groups of vg are replaced by a co bonding due to an alkyl aryl ether group 1226 cm 1 suggesting successful carboxylic functionalization of graphene oxide and the involvement of the carboxylic group in capturing 2mp another observation in lg was the presence of cn oxime 1675 cm 1 indicating sp2 carbon nitrogen bonding upon comparison of the ftir spectra of vg used in this study to unfunctionalized graphene oxide ugo reported elsewhere 45 we saw that the vg carboxylic peak at 3012 cm 1 seems to be absent in ugo the carboxylic groups of vg were found to be responsible for formation of an ether bond with 2mp in lg at 1226 cm 1 this ether bonding occurs in conjunction with the π π stacking that occurs between graphene and aromatic hydrocarbons resulting in the cumulative removal of 2mp 54 this emerging mechanism for interaction of 2mp with gon is represented in fig s2 the slight amplification of the trough representing cyclic alkene cc 1590 cm 1 and the introduction of a trough showing ch3 group methyl 1446 cm 1 in the spectrum of lg are indicative of the groups found in the 2mp structure and thus assert sorption functional moieties containing oxygen had been reported to act as water congregating regions wcr on the surface of the sorbents these wcrs were found responsible for limiting the number of total sites available for sorption 55 selective functionalization of gon using carboxylic acid functional groups is predicted to reduce hinderances from wcrs and enhance sorption capabilities ftir spectra of sac not shown were represented as virgin sac vs and 2mp loaded sac ls the oh carboxylic acid 1440 cm 1 in vs is replaced by oh alcohol 1420 cm 1 this may be attributed to cleavage of co into ether form c o creating further sites for reaction this is corroborated by ether peaks present in the ls spectrum 1212 cm 1 eds analysis of vg fig 3 a showed presence of c kα 0 27 kev and o kα 0 52 kev in the graphene structure presence of s kα 2 31 kev and cl kα 2 62 kev in the form of impurities was observed because of the use of h2so4 and c2h3clo2 in gon synthesis lg confirmed successful loading with 2mp because of presence of n kα 0 39 kev in the structure fig 3 b c and o peaks were also subdued due to the 2mp coating observed in sem analysis lower s levels with missing cl peak were indicative of non homogenous distribution of impurities throughout gon structure particles of sac were suitable for average particle size to be determined by gradation analysis coefficients of uniformity and curvature were found as 6 5 and 1 3 respectively indicating a well graded material average particle size diameter was found to be 0 383 mm graphene oxide is made up of one dimensional layers that combine together to form a crystalline two dimensional structure gon has been known to show low magnetic moments when not crosslinked 56 thus use of xrd for gon crystallite size determination is expected to be accurate the xrd graph of gon is shown in fig 4 the xrd spectrum was measured within a range of 2θ 5 to 80 a major diffraction peak in the xrd graph was found at 2θ 12 7 and identified to be the 0 0 2 reflection the numbers in the parentheses signify miller indices of the crystallographic planes associated with that particular peak of the xrd spectrum the well formed and sharp natured peak indicated a highly crystalline structure of gon this peak was used to calculate the distance between graphene nano layers the peak at 2θ 43 2 was identified as the 0 1 0 graphene oxide peak the existence of the peak indicated presence of short range order amongst graphene oxide layers there is a trend of rightward shift in peak position compared to virgin graphene oxide as a result of carboxylic functionalization in the basal plane of gon a third peak was identified at 2θ 26 2 indicating the presence of a small quantity of unexfoliated graphite 54 57 the mean height of a crystallite of gon layers τ was found to be τ 3 19 nm applying scherrer s model to the 0 0 2 peak with a shape factor of 0 9 interplanar distance between gon layers h was found as h 0 7 nm applying bragg s model to the 0 0 2 peak the mean diameter of stacked gon layers d was found by analysing the 2 d particle reflection of the 0 1 0 peak with d 17 48 nm applying scherrer s model with a warren constant value of 1 84 58 gon thus consists of 4 5 layers of stacked graphene having an interlayer distance of 0 7 nm a ratio of crystalline height to diameter can be used to imagine the extent of an individual gon crystallite and get a tentative idea of aggregation characteristics of gon the mean crystalline height to diameter ratio was found as 3 19 nm 17 48 nm the leaching of protons from the carboxyl groups from gon was used as a measure of its stability under operating conditions the solution ph right after addition of gon was measured as 6 92 the optimum ph for adsorption of 2mp on gon lies in the range of 5 7 as seen from the batch studies aqueous solutions of 2mp show a ph of 6 96 thus the ph range 5 7 was chosen for testing ph based stability after 48 h of contact with gon if the final ph of the filtrate were to fall drastically it would indicate loss of protons into solution due to ionization of carboxylic groups 59 the filtrates showed a 2 5 change in ph with respect to initial solution ph indicating negligible dissociation of protons from gon solution ph 4 ph 10 was previously reported to have no effect on carboxyl groups of graphene oxide nanomaterials 59 although at any ph out of this range there was a noticeable change in electrophoretic mobility indicating destabilization of the carboxylic linkage thermal stability was analysed by measuring the weight loss of gon in air with variation of temperature in the range of 298 k 498 k beyond which practical applications are not observed from fig s3 we can see that gradual mass loss of 18 occurred between 298 453 k denoting loss of water from the gon structure from 453 498 k the slope steepened with mass loss at 28 this signified that the disintegration of oxygen containing carboxyl groups had begun rapidly a similar phenomenon had previously been reported for carboxylated graphene oxide subjected to thermogravimetric analysis 39 thus it was concluded that for all practical applications as an adsorbent medium gon is thermally stable 3 2 properties of 2mp 3 2 1 isoelectric point of 2mp the ph at which the molecule exhibits zero overall charge in solution is called the isoelectric point ph i upon comparing sample and blank values by plotting zeta potential mv against ph the ph i of 2mp point corresponding to 0 mv potential was found to be 6 71 the isoelectric point of the toxin along with phzc of the sorbent and the ph of the solution together affect the removal efficiency of a pollutant by an adsorbent 3 2 2 hplc analysis and biodegradability of 2mp in the effluent upon hplc analysis the concentration of 2mp in the raw dye house wastewater prior to biological treatment was found to be 10 5 mg l 1 while the biologically treated effluent had a 2mp concentration of 7 2 mg l 1 biodegradability tests provided similar results the raw effluent was found to have a mean seasonal pre treatment bod cod ratio of 0 33 the post biologically treated effluent had a bod cod ratio of 0 24 which was found to be close to the average bod cod ratio of 0 22 obtained from synthetic solutions of 2mp in the tested concentration range of 5 20 mg l 1 thus 2mp was found to be only partially biodegraded by the conventional treatment method 3 3 adsorption studies effect of different parameters on percent removal of 2mp from solution by gon was studied via batch experimentation adsorptive capacities of the sorbent were analysed and compared to sac 3 3 1 dosage of sorbent in fig 5 the initial concentration c0 of 2mp was set at 5 mg l 1 both the sorbents performed similarly with a maximum 2mp removal efficiency greater than 75 the equilibrium adsorbent dosage for gon was found to be nearly 1 10th that of sac being 1 5 g l 1 for gon and 14 g l 1 for sac at a comparable sorbent dosage m 2 g l 1 while sac removed 27 of 2mp qe 0 675 mg g 1 gon removed 75 86 qe 1 925 mg g 1 a drop in adsorptive capacity per gram of adsorbent with increase in dosage of the adsorbents was observed because of uniform distribution of 2mp onto greater surface area of adsorbent during experimentation upon increasing 2mp concentration up to 10 mg l 1 the optimum dosage of adsorbents remained unchanged similar trends in 2mp removal as in fig 5 have been recorded by researchers in case of adsorbents like zeolite and activated carbon although the dosage of gon in g l 1 was found to be lower than other adsorbents 7 8 3 3 2 contact time to attain equilibrium the time of contact to achieve equilibrium saw a decrease of 25 moving from sac to gon pointing towards a system that is more willing to achieve equilibrium gon was found achieve equilibrium much faster than due to greater exposed surface area available for sorption it was seen from fig 6 that sac had higher adsorption rate initially 0 10 min but took slightly greater time to achieve equilibrium 120 min when compared to gon less than 90 min due to difference in dosage values of the sorbents the massive difference in adsorption capacity qe values for the sorbents was evident 3 3 3 ph of solution the removal efficiency when using both gon and sac was maximum in the ph range 6 7 close to the natural ph of 2mp 6 9 with efficiency dropping on both sides of ph 6 here the natural ph of 2mp was a near constant value measured for aqueous 2mp solutions of varied concentrations from 5 to 20 mg l 1 as seen in fig 7 in case of sac the drop in removal prior to ph 7 is drastic while it is smooth after ph 7 for gon a gradual rise in removal was observed up to ph 6 followed by a gradual drop a similar trend in adsorptive capacity was seen peaking at 2 4 mg g 1 for gon and 0 25 mg g 1 for sac initial ph might influence the chemical charge carried by 2mp in solution as also the surface charge of the sorbents the zero charge point of gon is 5 32 at a ph below which its surface is positively charged the pka value for 2mp is 5 96 and it gets protonated when ph falls below this value 7 an electrostatic interaction reaction mechanism inferred from ftir studies and confirmed by batch ph experimentation has been shown in fig s2 at ph 5 32 sorption is nullified by a repelling effect between similar charges on gon and 2mp 10 when ph rises above 5 96 to reach ph 7 the protonation potential of 2mp starts to fall although still interacting with a negatively charged deprotonated carboxyl group on gon surface to remove 2mp from solution 13 as ph of solution rises above 7 carboxyl groups on gon r cooh neutralize the mild alkalinity of the solution releasing protons into the solution a reduced supply of protons due to neutralization of alkalinity results in a gradual decrease in 2mp sorption onto gon when ph is further increased above 8 5 gon is bombarded with hydroxyl ions resulting in formation of wcrs on carboxyl groups thus drastically reducing its sorption capacity to 1 1 mg g 1 55 thus the 2mp 2mph transition is ph dependent and affects the extent of 2mp adsorption onto gon 3 3 4 system temperature temperature was varied in the range of 293 313 k the variation of sorption capacity of gon and sac with temperature was observed to be opposite to each other lowering the temperature curbed 2mp activity in aqueous solution and promoted sorption onto gon with removal percentage decreasing from 78 at 293 k to 72 at 313 k at a 2mp concentration of 5 mg l 1 on the other hand disintegration of structural integrity of sac with increasing temperature resulted in formation of finer pores and thus better mixing with 2mp this resulted in better sorption of 2mp on sac with increasing temperatures with removal percentage increasing from 76 5 at 293 k to 79 5 at 313 k additionally spherical and convective diffusion phenomena could be responsible for endothermic pore transport of 2mp on sac 48 it was seen that gon has the better removal efficiency per gram adsorbent dosage the changes in adsorptive capacity of the adsorbents have been shown in fig 8 3 3 5 initial concentration of 2mp initial 2mp concentration c0 was varied in the range of 2 5 20 mg l 1 at a fixed temperature as seen from fig 8 in case of gon adsorption at 303 k there was a steady decrease in relative removal percentage from 77 to 65 as c0 of 2mp was increased from 2 5 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 the differences in 2mp uptake at equilibrium diminished due to repelling nature of intraparticle effects and π π stacking amongst the 2mp molecules at increasing 2mp loadings the wcrs might be replaced by 2mp molecules the adsorption capacity on the other hand increased with increase in c0 of 2mp from 1 33 mg g 1 at 2 5 mg l 1 c0 to 8 56 mg g 1 at 20 mg l 1 c0 the decrease in observed removal was because of the fact that a given mass of adsorbent adsorbs only a fixed amount of adsorbate however the amount of 2mp adsorbed per unit adsorbent mass increased with an increase in c0 this is because of the decrease in the resistance to mass transfer of the solute from the solution a similar trend was observed for sac with removal varying from 0 125 mg g 1 at 2 5 mg l 1 c0 to 0 802 mg g 1 at 20 mg l 1 c0 with removal percentages of 80 and 64 respectively 3 3 6 adsorption kinetics equilibrium and thermodynamics the models used for kinetics experiments were pseudo first order pseudo second order and weber morris intraparticle diffusion respectively shown in eq 3 5 48 3 d q t d t k 1 q e q t 4 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 5 q t k 3 i t 1 2 c the pseudo second order model fit the experimental data of both sorbents best with the modelled adsorption capacity value being in agreement with the experimental capacity higher values of second order rate constant at low 2mp concentrations 5 10 mg l 1 are indicative of a system that is able to achieve equilibrium at a faster pace this was confirmed by the time of contact batch study a ten fold difference in qe was observed between gon and sac intraparticle diffusion was illustrated by the weber morris wm equation in both sorption systems the model parameters and their values are mentioned in table 3 both the sorbent systems had an intercept c in their first diffusion stages implying distinct macro mesopore and meso micropore intraparticle diffusion phases corroborate the system state from initial sorption conditions to reaching equilibrium was modelled using various non linear isotherm equations including langmuir lan freundlich fre redlich peterson rep toth tot and radke prausnitz rap respectively in

their functioning application advantages and disadvantages have been discussed in previous works 60 61 the experimental adsorption data were plotted against predicted isotherm data obtained from different models and are represented in fig 9 a and b both plots showed concave curves with respect to x axis indicative of lower 2mp loadings used in the study residual analysis by chi square test x 2 for goodness of fit was undertaken to quantify the deviation in the predicted model results in comparison to batch studies and to decide which isotherm model closely replicated the sorption system 61 11 χ 2 k 1 d q e e q e p 2 q e p k the chi squared test is a very sensitive test since at lower residuals the value of x 2 is low and at high residuals its value rises steeply the residual calculation methods along with the obtained error values are mentioned in table 4 least values of residuals and highest value of correlation coefficient r2 at all temperatures are indicators of best fit it is evident after analysis of average residuals in table 4 and also from fig 9 a and b respectively that the 2mp gon system is best represented by the rep model while the 2mp sac system is best simulated by the lan model the langmuir model suggests a homogeneous single layer adsorption mechanism while the rep model suggests a hybrid multiple layer adsorption mechanism 60 for the gon 2mp system r p parameters at 303 k were found to be kir 10 0 l mg 1 β 0 311 and air 3 54 l mg 1 for the sac 2mp system we had langmuir parameters as qm 1 464 mg g 1 and kil 0 164 l mg 1 fig 10 shows the van t hoff thermodynamic plots for 2mp adsorption onto gon and sac gibb s free energy equation was modified to van t hoff equation shown in in eq 12 to find values of δh δs and δg 8 12 ln k a d δ g 0 r t δ s 0 r δ h 0 r 1 t results for thermodynamic studies were recorded in table 5 the negative and closely obtained values of δg0 in the range of 293 k 313 k indicated that sorption process was spontaneous and favourable for both the sorbent sorbate systems at all temperatures the free energy variation in gon 0 151 kj mol 1 between 293 k and 313 k seemed to be lesser affected by temperature extremes when compared to sac 1 578 kj mol 1 the kad for gon was also found to be one order of magnitude higher than sac implying better distribution and reaction efficiency based on δh0 the gon 2mp system was determined as exothermic and the sac 2mp system as endothermic the differing slope directions of the van t hoff plots for the adsorbents was an indication of this δh0 and δg0 values of both sorbents implied physical adsorption of 2mp taking place onto the surface the positive values of δs0 indicated randomness at the solid liquid interface with some structural changes in the adsorbate and adsorbent and an affinity of adsorbents towards 2mp free energy change was greater in case of gon because of higher surface area for sorption 3 3 7 understanding of selectivity the methyl group ch3 is non polar but when attached to pyridine ring has the ability to protonate a difference in electronegativity values of n 3 04 and the α c 2 55 in the pyridinic ring along with the sp2 hybridization of nc due to involvement of p orbitals results in development of polarity in the pyridinic ring which in turn affects the methyl group attached at α c the polarization potential of 2mp makes it more electropositive when compared to pyridine and benzene carboxylic group attached to the surface of gon has the greatest polarity so also group electronegativity compared to alcohols aldehydes and alkyl halides thus possessing the highest pulling potential of attracting a mildly polar protonated alkane methyl group 62 63 there is a stark decrease in polarity with increase in alkyl functional group chain length thus compared to alkanes and alkyl functionalized aromatics 2mp is expected to have higher polarity and better mobility thus we can see that in a purely organic matter environment 2mp has the potential to be selectively adsorbed onto gon 3 4 process optimization the coded factor values were chosen as x1 ph x2 m x3 c0 and x4 t the polynomial model developed for 2mp removal by gon can be written as eq 13 13 removal 71 815 1 801 x 1 6 208 x 2 5 2938 x 3 1 516 x 4 20 580 x 1 2 8 904 x 2 2 4 170 x 3 2 2 599 x 4 2 1 276 x 1 x 2 0 777 x 1 x 3 0 728 x 1 x 4 2 969 x 2 x 3 3 331 x 2 x 4 7 972 x 3 x 4 variance analysis showed that developing a model with terms greater than two factor linear interactions did not result in a good fit coded values cv are convertible to experimentally used values ev by using eq 14 14 c v e v u l 2 u l 2 γ a determination coefficient value of r2 0 992 mathematically confirmed the model s ability to simulate real world adsorption of 2mp onto gon with controlled variation lagrange s criterion was utilized for determination of optimum conditions for maximum 2mp removal predicted by the model and yielded a negative function value 43 gradient vectors with respect to each factor were developed and solved simultaneously to obtain optimal coded values of x1 0 013 x2 0 522 x3 0 478 and x4 0 704 experimental values relating to these codes are ph 7 04 m 1 80 g l 1 c0 16 89 mg l 1 and t 293 82 k the model successfully predicted 72 1 removal of 2mp upon applying these conditions to batch experimentation the removal percentage obtained was in excess of the model predicted removal by 0 71 thus corroborating with the findings 3 4 1 impact of factors the sign of each regression coefficient in the yield equation has either a constructive or a derogatory effect on 2mp removal the regression coefficients can gauge the impact of a unit change in variable value on the predicted removal a positive change in level of x1 and x2 had an incremental impact while x3 and x4 had a decremental impact a pareto chart was plotted using the absolute values of the coefficients in fig 11 the terms of ph x1 2 and m x2 2 aided in better 2mp removal contributing 21 and 7 to model yield respectively the factors shown in the plot accounted for 96 of the total impact on removal further a normal probability plot factor effects was plotted in fig s4 the central effects formed a straight line with a slight left skew to the plot implying normally distribution the linear x1 quadratic x1 2 x2 2 and interaction x3 x4 x1 x3 effects were most disruptive to process stability due to their sparse occurrence and notable deviation from the line 64 3 4 2 response surface analysis visual representation of 4d factor effects is difficult in a 3d space the representation of eq 13 was thus limited to effects occurring from factors taken two at a time resulting in the generation of 4c2 equations comprising of linear squared and interaction terms the factors omitted from change in a particular run were maintained at central values which are coded to zero the interaction effects observed from each combination of factors on the 2mp sorption is represented in fig 12 a f on analysis of each response surface generated and its associated contour it was seen that ph x1 had the most substantial impact on removal of 2mp by gon a small change in x1 manifested as an increase in surface curvature in fig 12 a c the most suitable result was attained at a coded value of x1 0 which corresponds to neutral ph of solution corroborating results obtained from batch experiments 3 4 3 adequacy of model formulation the change observed between experimental 2mp removal and model predicted removal is called the error in prediction upon plotting the normal probability graph of model errors it was seen that a randomly distributed cloud of points was formed not adhering to a particular trend fig 13 a this confirmed the normal distribution of modelled data implying good fit accuracy of the model was further put to test by plotting a graph of experimental and modelled removal data fig 13 b then running regression analysis a linear relation between the datasets was observed with regression analysis confirming that an accurate mathematical relation existed between the two datasets with an r2 0 986 3 4 4 model validation the model was run five times at zero centre levels of coded factors to test its stability in generating repeatable and reproducible results this data was compared to experimental adsorption results and noted in serial numbers 22 26 of table 1 further testing was carried out by with random values for factors chosen from within their range serial numbers 27 30 with the main aim of checking compatibility with experimental results the model successfully predicted percentages for 2mp removal with an average absolute error percentage of 0 871 the capability of the model to accurately predict experimental results was thus verified 4 conclusion this study concludes based on batch studies and mathematical optimization that gon can be used to replace traditional adsorbent sac in treatment of industrial solvent 2mp in the concentration range of 2 5 20 mg l 1 a safe thermally controlled process for synthesis of exfoliated carboxyl graphene oxide nanocomposite was suggested characterization of gon was used to enunciate the structure crystallite particle size and mechanism of 2mp sorption the exfoliation carboxyl functionalization and π π forces in gon are responsible for its increase in adsorption capacity sac on the other hand relies solely on electrostatic interactions for adsorption of 2mp gon showed ten times the adsorption capacity 8 78 mg g 1 at one tenth the sorbent dosage 1 5 g l 1 of sac reducing the footprint of spent adsorbent the adsorbent 2mp equilibrium was highly ph dependant with maximum removal occurring at ph 7 thermodynamic studies kinetics and equilibrium analyses all elucidate the structural and chemical superiority of gon as an adsorbent the doehlert optimization model showed that quadratic effects of ph and m most affected 2mp sorption onto gon solution ph of 7 was confirmed by modelling to be the optimal ph of operation experimental and predicted datasets were corelated by r2 0 986 resulting in low modeling error optimal factor conditions yielded a removal of 72 10 effects of the interaction between more than two factors on removal was found insignificant the success of the model was validated by comparing outcomes of repeated constant value experimental runs and random value runs gon was thus successful in removal of 2mp although for industrial application a study of interfering solvent interactions is necessary declaration of competing interest the

nitroaromatics found in textile and pharmaceutical wastewater the two largescale manufacturing industries wastewaters from animal husbandry farms including poultry have also shown the presence of 2mp since it is used as a solvent in coccidiostats manufacture 1 2mp is used as a solvent in dyeing and rinsing baths of cotton compounds with 2mp pass completely unaltered through the conventional activated sludge processes of biological treatment due to non mineralization of refractory organics and poor bod removal 2 while one time exposure to low concentrations of 2mp 0 5 mg l 1 does not bio magnify repeated exposure to 2mp contaminated waters can lead to the bio accumulation of the neurotoxin in turn leading to endocrine disrupting activity and multiple organ failure in humans 3 acute exposure can lead to suppression of central nervous system severe depression and physical exhaustion 4 thus there arises the need to curb the presence of 2mp from waterbodies methylpyridine concentration of 12 26 mg l 1 has been found in coking wastewaters although a concentration lesser than 1 mg l 1 is recommended by the industry 5 wastewater from tar plants was recorded to compose of a high concentration of 2mp in the range of 54 140 mg l 1 6 for industrial workers a threshold limit value of 15 mg m 3 has been set for 2mp exposure on a daily basis 2mp is poorly degraded in the natural environment and its removal is made harder because it bears no net charges 7 8 it is pertinent to restrict the discharge of 2mp bearing wastewaters into subsurface water sources a concentration limit of 0 316 mg l 1 and 1 mg l 1 has been set in this regard by the us epa and the uk standards for heterocyclic bases another finding showed that even 0 5 mg l 1 of 2mp in waterbodies is enough to make fishes unsuitable for human consumption 3 the indian central pollution control board cpcb india addresses this point by labelling pyridinic pollutants as dangerous odorous nuisances in water classes sw i and sw ii regarding marine and coastal outfalls it also advises against presence of these pollutants in ecologically sensitive zones and bath waters 9 literature on 2mp removal focuses on removal of high concentration 100 500 mg l 1 of 2mp from aqueous solutions 7 8 such low volume high concentration lv hc discharge of 2mp is observed from industries where 2mp is used as a primary chemical component in manufacture for e g pharmaceuticals for textile industries utilizing 2mp as a solvent with a high volume low concentration discharge hv lc designing a lv hc system with a high safety coefficient is unnecessary resulting in over utilization of a large volume of adsorbent 8 10 this in turn leads to production of a large footprint of spent adsorbent drastically increasing hazards associated with disposal prior to conceptualization of this study hplc analysis of freshly discharged treated dye house effluent from a textile industry detected the presence of 2mp it was found to contain 2mp in concentrations greater than the recommended limit this finding is of concern because in developing and under developed countries textile plants of capacities greater than 1000 m3 per day consistently discharge effluents into storm drains that lead them directly to local water bodies government policies focus primarily on lv hc 2mp concentrations whilst not considering hv lc systems thus creating an exploitable loophole this study involving removal of hv lc 2mp concentrations from simulated synthetic solutions is thus of importance researchers have attempted to remove azaarenic alkylpyridines by the application of adsorptive methods using coconut shells amorphous silicon dioxide jordanian zeolites and kaolin 7 8 10 all of these materials require high adsorbent doses for the treatment of 2mp which in turn leads to production of a large volume of spent adsorbent 11 the large footprint of the spent adsorbent is hazardous to dispose of into landfills because of the greater surface area available for leaching of previously adsorbed species activated carbon is also structurally weak further increasing risk of structural disintegration and fouling 12 thus the need for development of an improved adsorbent with low dosage better performance and structural stability was felt new age sorbents like graphene nanocomposites have shown great promise in this field and their utilization in uptake of refractory industrial solvents has been lacking in literature 13 high adsorptive capacities have been observed in graphene based nanomaterials which contain sp2 hybridized carbon atoms as building blocks of honey comb like structures similar to fullerenes and carbon nanotubes 14 17 applications for similar products have been observed in electrochemical sensors with high selectivity towards a given species 18 21 electronics medicine and contamination curtailment 22 25 as an adsorbent graphene oxide has shown great potential in removal of emerging organic contaminants like nitroaromatics tetracyclines antibiotics and dyes 26 28 apart from having a hydrophobic effect on organic pollutants the presence of a π π interaction between the graphene oxide structure and an organic toxicant molecule results in their removal from solution 29 30 graphene nanoparticles have shown an ability to exhibit high theoretical exposed surface area 2620 m2 g 1 although a loss in observed surface area to 300 1000 m2 g 1 has been reported 31 35 to counteract the effect of accretion in graphene oxide the process of exfoliation is used to separate the layers by mechanical chemical or thermal means 36 graphene has displayed affinity towards functionalization 37 when functionalized it has shown remarkable capacity for sorption of toxic pollutants 38 carboxylic functionalization of exfoliated graphene oxide nanocomposite results in a mono layer of highly oxidized structure bearing carboxylic and hydroxylic functional group in the basal plane this has been known to increase efficiency of organic pollutant adsorption it is also reported to improve alignment of gon sheets in crystallites that helps in control of crystallite size better thermal control in gon synthesis also preserves structural integrity of basal planes of gon layers thermal control also helps to drastically make the synthesis process of graphene oxide safe with minimization of exothermicity of the reaction and so2 emission the use of carboxyl graphene has been very limited in industrial effluent extraction 39 optimal utilization of the sorbent is of prime importance for its conservation reuse and disposal in real life situations impact of factor interactions on removal efficiency of the sorbent hold greater importance than single factor batch studies these objectives are realized by mathematical modelling of sorption by the process of design of experiments doe analyzing the impact of each controllable factor affecting adsorption 40 41 full factorial method lays excessive stress on each individual factor interaction resulting in large number of experiments fractional factorial on the other hand is unable to gauge factor interactions with precision 42 another hindrance is the usage of a fixed number of levels per factor even though each factor affects adsorption to a different degree experimental data optimization by non linear doehlert design was thus deemed appropriate since it combines fewer experimental runs with relatively low error in output prediction and employs varying number of levels for each factor depending upon their impact on adsorption 43 in this study 2mp removal by gon was optimized by using doehlert design matrix formulation which utilizes uniform distribution of experimental points chosen from the predetermined four factor dd matrix 44 the predicted results from the developed mathematical model were corroborated by results of batch studies response surfaces and contours were plotted for visualization of multi factor effects on removal these studies establish gon as an effective adsorptive media with great potential in industrial solvent treatment this study was conducted to i detect the solvent 2mp in treated industrial effluent samples ii synthesize the advanced adsorbent exfoliated carboxyl graphene oxide nanocomposite and achieve thermal control in graphene oxide synthesis iii compare the sorption capacity adsorption mechanism and structural stability of gon with activated carbon sac for uptake of 2mp at low concentrations 2 5 20 mg l 1 and iv optimize the adsorption process by 4

permanganate kmno4 concentrated sulfuric acid h2so4 orthophosphoric acid h3po4 hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and chloroacetic acid c2h3clo2 were obtained from merck germany textile dye house wastewater containing 2mp was procured from a 1500 m3 per day capacity plant situated in howrah district w b india 2 2 pre cooled synthesis of exfoliated carboxylic graphene oxide nanocomposite the initial ingredients used for making graphene oxide were referred to from modified hummers method 45 46 the hummers preparation process is extremely exothermic and partly explosive leading to expulsion of heat and highly toxic fumes thermal control is a vital process in ensuring safe synthesis of gon graphite powder with fine spherical particles was used in the synthesis for better exfoliation and high exposed surface area for carboxylization a 9 1 mixture of concentrated h2so4 h3po4 180 20 ml was prepared producing a slight exotherm of 323 k the mix was cooled to 283 k prior to addition of graphite powder 1 5 g 1 wt equiv and kmno4 6 wt equiv a very tame reaction was observed with the temperature rising to 303 k when this step was conducted without pre cooling of the acid mix an explosive reaction occurred with profuse so2 emission the reaction was stirred for 1 h and maintained at 293 k using an ice bath the ice bath was intermittently removed and continuous stirring was provided for 12 h at 328 k the reaction was cooled to room temperature and poured onto ice 400 ml with 30 h2o2 2 ml the brown coloured graphene oxide nanoparticles were allowed to settle and the excess supernatant was decanted then evaporated the graphene oxide nanoparticles were washed repeatedly with double distilled water on a whatman 42 filter paper then with 200 ml of 0 1 n naoh for ph neutralization carboxylic functionalization was undertaken by gradual addition of 0 03 m of naoh and 0 01 m of c2h3clo2 to the gon precipitate followed by mixing for 3 h fig s1 centrifugation of the gon suspension was carried out pr24 remi instruments at 4000 rpm for 4 h followed by washing the gon suspension was then washed in an efficient manner firstly using 30 hcl and ethanol to remove impurities and then using ddw this washing was again performed on a whatman 42 grade filter paper without multiple replacements leading to reuse of chemical reagents gon was then exfoliated by sonicating for 2 h and annealing it at 673 k for 2 h this exfoliated graphene was more perceptive to the effects of carboxylic functionalization 2 3 characterization the sorbents were characterized by different instrumental analyses to understand their physico chemical properties ftir ft ir 4700 jasco study was used for functional group determination and tentative reaction mechanism determination scanning electron microscopy sem joel6380a jeol ltd equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds was used to define surface morphologies and chemical composition proximate analysis was carried out as per is 1350 1 1984 to understand physical characteristics of the sorbents the ph associated with the point of zero charge phzc of the sorbents was found using ph drift method 47 average particle size of sac was found by using gradation analysis for determining nanoscale crystallite particle size of gon x ray diffraction xrd vortex me7 hitachi with cuk α λ 1 54056 nm radiation was used stability of gon was tested under operating conditions by i measuring leaching of protons from the carboxyl groups on gon into solution in the optimum batch operating ph range of 5 7 and ii understanding thermal stability for estimating ph stability 200 ml ddw solutions with ph 5 6 and 7 were prepared gon 2 g l 1 was added to each solution and the solution ph was measured after stirring each system for 48 h at 400 rpm the gon was centrifuged and filtered out of the solution and ph of the filtrate was measured thermal stability under practical use was tested by checking the weight loss in a sample of gon in air using a muffle furnace with respect to every 10 k rise in temperature in the range of 298 k 498 k acid base titrimetric method was used to find the isoelectric point of 2mp solutions 0 01 m of both naoh and hcl were taken along with 20 mg l 1 of 2mp solution in the flask as sample a blank run was performed for charge variation detection potential was measured using the ph meter in mv mode ph 700 eutech instruments for biodegradability studies of 2mp cod cr 3200 digester wtw was used 2 4 2mp detection the uhplc used for detection of 2mp in effluent and synthetic samples ultimate 3000 thermo scientific was fitted with a hypersil gold 4 6 250 mm 5μm column a 55 45 eluent ratio of acetonitrile to hplc grade water was found to give the best peak characteristics when used at a flow rate 0 5 ml min 1 and an injection volume of 1 μl with the temperature set to 303 k and the detection wavelength to 262 nm λmax of 2mp in the uv region the time of detection of 2mp was found to be 7 4 min the system was calibrated by using 2mp concentrations in the range of 1 100 mg l 1 the industrial effluent was diluted multiple times before using in the hplc 2 5 2mp removal study batch equilibrium sorption studies were conducted to test the sorption efficiencies of gon and sac stock solutions of 2mp with concentration 1000 ppm were prepared in ddw a series of 50 ml stoppered borosil conical flasks were taken for batch studies and filled to the brim to prevent gas accumulation for the sorption experiments the flasks were half filled with ddw sorbent was then added and sonicated for 15 min for proper particle dissipation 2mp was added and ddw was filled to brim all experiments were carried out at room temperature 303 1 k unless mentioned otherwise aliquots were extracted and post sorption 2mp concentration was determined by the process mentioned in section 2 6 equilibrium sorbent dosage m ph ph0 contact time t initial 2mp concentration c0 and temperature t studies were completed 48 2mp solutions of 5 mg l 1 were studied unless specified separately the prepared samples were agitated at 150 rpm for the determined equilibrium time the initial ph values of aqueous solutions were kept near the natural ph of 2mp around 7 0 5 which consequently was also the ph that showed maximum removal permutations of initial 2mp loading and sorbent dosing were analysed to check the variation in sorbent efficiency optimum value of each parameter obtained from a particular set of batch studies was carried forward to the next set of experiments conducted for the following parameter specifically for dosage study the sorbent dosage was varied from 0 5 3 g l 1 for gon and 2 20 g l 1 for sac optimal adsorbent dose for 2mp removal was determined subsequently studies on ph were conducted by changing ph from 2 to 12 with increments of 2 units the required solution ph 2 12 was attuned by adding minute amounts of 1 n h2so4 and 0 1 n naoh solution using a ph meter contact time studies were conducted up to 240 min prior to which both sorbent systems had achieved equilibrium a temperature range of 293 k 313 k was considered for temperature studies and a concentration range of 2 5 20 mg l 1 of 2mp was studied for initial toxicant studies 2 6 sample analyses post sorption of 2mp onto sac and gon 10 ml samples were drawn and centrifugally separated from the sorbents followed by filtration through whatman grade 42 filter paper the 2mp filtrates obtained were then analysed to determine the 2mp concentration spectrophotometrically with the help of the double beam uv vis spectrophotometer 2203 systronics a wavelength of 262 nm was used for analysis to understand the significance of adsorbate loss during analyses blank 2mp solutions were prepared and examined the losses were found to be insignificant with an average absorbance error of 0 001 to insure data quality assurance and reproducibility all the experiments were conducted in duplicate and averages were noted fresh 2mp stock and samples were prepared for each study and analysis instruments were recalibrated if needed all glass apparatuses were acid washed cleansed and oven dried prior to use 2 7 doehlert design four factors chosen for analysis with their chosen range of values were ph 4 10 m 1 2 g l 1 c0 5 20 mg l 1 and t 293 308 k importance of each factor was gauged from batch studies and number of levels to each were assigned accordingly with larger number of levels indicating better resolution the dd matrix was prepared from the simplex table represented by first 5 rows of table 1 a 2d simplex is visualized as an isosceles triangle with unit length sides pivoted at the center the entire dd matrix is derived from the simplex by permutative subtraction of each corner from the pivoting point 43 a 4d matrix is harder to physically represent but may be mathematically expressed as an extension of lower level simplexes of dimension d 1 44 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 6 1 2 d 1 d 2 1 2 d d 1 d 1 2 d number of factors f influence the number of experimental runs n in accordance with the relation n f f 1 1 a dd model was developed consisting of linear and squared factor terms along with linear interaction effects 49 dd utilizes uniform shell design which suggests the uniform distribution of factor values in each experimental run reducing the number of experimental runs required in model development experimental runs were conducted in duplicate according to the design matrix in batch mode by assuming equilibration at t 90 min the 2mp removal percentages obtained were fit into a model equation of the form 50 2 removal r o i 1 4 a i x i i 1 4 b i x i 2 i j 1 4 c i j x i x j ε i j 100 where r0 ai bi and cij are regression coefficients and εij is the prediction error the yield obtained from the model is the removal of 2mp the dd design experimental 2mp removal dd predicted removal and model error are given in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of adsorbing materials the physico chemical properties of average particle size proximate analysis parameters and phzc for gon and sac are listed in table 2 gon showed higher fixed carbon content along with lower composition of other entities the phzc were found to lie in the acidic region with phzc gon phzc sac upon analysing other recorded studies of phzc of graphene oxide 51 52 while one study reported a similar phzc value another reported a lower phzc this difference in results could be attributed to the degree of washing and ph neutralization of the adsorbents post synthesis and prior to use in batch studies the use of strong acids in the synthesis process for activation and exfoliation of the adsorbents lowers the ph of the surface of the adsorbent directly affecting the results obtained for phzc scanning electron microscopy sem image of sac in fig 1 a shows macropores and certain mesopores of sac high surface irregularity is indicated by the presence of higher contrast in the image with bright and darker regions fig 1 b shows these pores densely coated with a dull smooth and uniform layer of the loaded 2mp which is indicated by circled region 2 virgin gon fig 1 c has a greasy looking gon layer with sprinkled particles on the surface showing successful exfoliation and composite formation region 1 shows one such composite particle of gon with particle size 2 μm sizes up to 0 5 μm were resolvable as bright spots in the image these particles stick to the parent particle via van der waals forces and form rough undulations gon coated with 2mp fig 1 d has a smooth texture with slight plateaus and coated gon particles which appear like granules in region 3 an observation reported by nitrogen adsorption isotherm analysis suggests that activated carbon is mostly a microporous sorbent while gon employs both micropores and macropores 29 ftir study was conducted on both the sorbents in virgin and 2mp loaded conditions the presence of a trough at wavenumber 3406 cm 1 in both virgin gon vg and 2mp loaded gon lg represents strong and broad intermolecularly bonded oh group possibly due to the presence of moisture content the trough at 3012 cm 1 in vg is replaced by a smaller one at 3010 cm 1 in lg representing an oh bond of a cooh group there is also an attenuation in trough depth from vg to lg representing a reduction in free cooh groups present and cleavage in the oh bond this along with a simultaneous disappearance of alcohol groups oh phenolic 1339 cm 1 and c oh primary alcohol 1063 cm 1 from the vg spectrum were an indication to the change in the virgin gon structure on loading with 2mp these functional groups corroborates to gon structures previously proposed 53 as shown in fig 2 the dampened carboxylic acid and disappearing alcohol groups of vg are replaced by a co bonding due to an alkyl aryl ether group 1226 cm 1 suggesting successful carboxylic functionalization of graphene oxide and the involvement of the carboxylic group in capturing 2mp another observation in lg was the presence of cn oxime 1675 cm 1 indicating sp2 carbon nitrogen bonding upon comparison of the ftir spectra of vg used in this study to unfunctionalized graphene oxide ugo reported elsewhere 45 we saw that the vg carboxylic peak at 3012 cm 1 seems to be absent in ugo the carboxylic groups of vg were found to be responsible for formation of an ether bond with 2mp in lg at 1226 cm 1 this ether bonding occurs in conjunction with the π π stacking that occurs between graphene and aromatic hydrocarbons resulting in the cumulative removal of 2mp 54 this emerging mechanism for interaction of 2mp with gon is represented in fig s2 the slight amplification of the trough representing cyclic alkene cc 1590 cm 1 and the introduction of a trough showing ch3 group methyl 1446 cm 1 in the spectrum of lg are indicative of the groups found in the 2mp structure and thus assert sorption functional moieties containing oxygen had been reported to act as water congregating regions wcr on the surface of the sorbents these wcrs were found responsible for limiting the number of total sites available for sorption 55 selective functionalization of gon using carboxylic acid functional groups is predicted to reduce hinderances from wcrs and enhance sorption capabilities ftir spectra of sac not shown were represented as virgin sac vs and 2mp loaded sac ls the oh carboxylic acid 1440 cm 1 in vs is replaced by oh alcohol 1420 cm 1 this may be attributed to cleavage of co into ether form c o creating further sites for reaction this is corroborated by ether peaks present in the ls spectrum 1212 cm 1 eds analysis of vg fig 3 a showed presence of c kα 0 27 kev and o kα 0 52 kev in the graphene structure presence of s kα 2 31 kev and cl kα 2 62 kev in the form of impurities was observed because of the use of h2so4 and c2h3clo2 in gon synthesis lg confirmed successful loading with 2mp because of presence of n kα 0 39 kev in the structure fig 3 b c and o peaks were also subdued due to the 2mp coating observed in sem analysis lower s levels with missing cl peak were indicative of non homogenous distribution of impurities throughout gon structure particles of sac were suitable for average particle size to be determined by gradation analysis coefficients of uniformity and curvature were found as 6 5 and 1 3 respectively indicating a well graded material average particle size diameter was found to be 0 383 mm graphene oxide is made up of one dimensional layers that combine together to form a crystalline two dimensional structure gon has been known to show low magnetic moments when not crosslinked 56 thus use of xrd for gon crystallite size determination is expected to be accurate the xrd graph of gon is shown in fig 4 the xrd spectrum was measured within a range of 2θ 5 to 80 a major diffraction peak in the xrd graph was found at 2θ 12 7 and identified to be the 0 0 2 reflection the numbers in the parentheses signify miller indices of the crystallographic planes associated with that particular peak of the xrd spectrum the well formed and sharp natured peak indicated a highly crystalline structure of gon this peak was used to calculate the distance between graphene nano layers the peak at 2θ 43 2 was identified as the 0 1 0 graphene oxide peak the existence of the peak indicated presence of short range order amongst graphene oxide layers there is a trend of rightward shift in peak position compared to virgin graphene oxide as a result of carboxylic functionalization in the basal plane of gon a third peak was identified at 2θ 26 2 indicating the presence of a small quantity of unexfoliated graphite 54 57 the mean height of a crystallite of gon layers τ was found to be τ 3 19 nm applying scherrer s model to the 0 0 2 peak with a shape factor of 0 9 interplanar distance between gon layers h was found as h 0 7 nm applying bragg s model to the 0 0 2 peak the mean diameter of stacked gon layers d was found by analysing the 2 d particle reflection of the 0 1 0 peak with d 17 48 nm applying scherrer s model with a warren constant value of 1 84 58 gon thus consists of 4 5 layers of stacked graphene having an interlayer distance of 0 7 nm a ratio of crystalline height to diameter can be used to imagine the extent of an individual gon crystallite and get a tentative idea of aggregation characteristics of gon the mean crystalline height to diameter ratio was found as 3 19 nm 17 48 nm the leaching of protons from the carboxyl groups from gon was used as a measure of its stability under operating conditions the solution ph right after addition of gon was measured as 6 92 the optimum ph for adsorption of 2mp on gon lies in the range of 5 7 as seen from the batch studies aqueous solutions of 2mp show a ph of 6 96 thus the ph range 5 7 was chosen for testing ph based stability after 48 h of contact with gon if the final ph of the filtrate were to fall drastically it would indicate loss of protons into solution due to ionization of carboxylic groups 59 the filtrates showed a 2 5 change in ph with respect to initial solution ph indicating negligible dissociation of protons from gon solution ph 4 ph 10 was previously reported to have no effect on carboxyl groups of graphene oxide nanomaterials 59 although at any ph out of this range there was a noticeable change in electrophoretic mobility indicating destabilization of the carboxylic linkage thermal stability was analysed by measuring the weight loss of gon in air with variation of temperature in the range of 298 k 498 k beyond which practical applications are not observed from fig s3 we can see that gradual mass loss of 18 occurred between 298 453 k denoting loss of water from the gon structure from 453 498 k the slope steepened with mass loss at 28 this signified that the disintegration of oxygen containing carboxyl groups had begun rapidly a similar phenomenon had previously been reported for carboxylated graphene oxide subjected to thermogravimetric analysis 39 thus it was concluded that for all practical applications as an adsorbent medium gon is thermally stable 3 2 properties of 2mp 3 2 1 isoelectric point of 2mp the ph at which the molecule exhibits zero overall charge in solution is called the isoelectric point ph i upon comparing sample and blank values by plotting zeta potential mv against ph the ph i of 2mp point corresponding to 0 mv potential was found to be 6 71 the isoelectric point of the toxin along with phzc of the sorbent and the ph of the solution together affect the removal efficiency of a pollutant by an adsorbent 3 2 2 hplc analysis and biodegradability of 2mp in the effluent upon hplc analysis the concentration of 2mp in the raw dye house wastewater prior to biological treatment was found to be 10 5 mg l 1 while the biologically treated effluent had a 2mp concentration of 7 2 mg l 1 biodegradability tests provided similar results the raw effluent was found to have a mean seasonal pre treatment bod cod ratio of 0 33 the post biologically treated effluent had a bod cod ratio of 0 24 which was found to be close to the average bod cod ratio of 0 22 obtained from synthetic solutions of 2mp in the tested concentration range of 5 20 mg l 1 thus 2mp was found to be only partially biodegraded by the conventional treatment method 3 3 adsorption studies effect of different parameters on percent removal of 2mp from solution by gon was studied via batch experimentation adsorptive capacities of the sorbent were analysed and compared to sac 3 3 1 dosage of sorbent in fig 5 the initial concentration c0 of 2mp was set at 5 mg l 1 both the sorbents performed similarly with a maximum 2mp removal efficiency greater than 75 the equilibrium adsorbent dosage for gon was found to be nearly 1 10th that of sac being 1 5 g l 1 for gon and 14 g l 1 for sac at a comparable sorbent dosage m 2 g l 1 while sac removed 27 of 2mp qe 0 675 mg g 1 gon removed 75 86 qe 1 925 mg g 1 a drop in adsorptive capacity per gram of adsorbent with increase in dosage of the adsorbents was observed because of uniform distribution of 2mp onto greater surface area of adsorbent during experimentation upon increasing 2mp concentration up to 10 mg l 1 the optimum dosage of adsorbents remained unchanged similar trends in 2mp removal as in fig 5 have been recorded by researchers in case of adsorbents like zeolite and activated carbon although the dosage of gon in g l 1 was found to be lower than other adsorbents 7 8 3 3 2 contact time to attain equilibrium the time of contact to achieve equilibrium saw a decrease of 25 moving from sac to gon pointing towards a system that is more willing to achieve equilibrium gon was found achieve equilibrium much faster than due to greater exposed surface area available for sorption it was seen from fig 6 that sac had higher adsorption rate initially 0 10 min but took slightly greater time to achieve equilibrium 120 min when compared to gon less than 90 min due to difference in dosage values of the sorbents the massive difference in adsorption capacity qe values for the sorbents was evident 3 3 3 ph of solution the removal efficiency when using both gon and sac was maximum in the ph range 6 7 close to the natural ph of 2mp 6 9 with efficiency dropping on both sides of ph 6 here the natural ph of 2mp was a near constant value measured for aqueous 2mp solutions of varied concentrations from 5 to 20 mg l 1 as seen in fig 7 in case of sac the drop in removal prior to ph 7 is drastic while it is smooth after ph 7 for gon a gradual rise in removal was observed up to ph 6 followed by a gradual drop a similar trend in adsorptive capacity was seen peaking at 2 4 mg g 1 for gon and 0 25 mg g 1 for sac initial ph might influence the chemical charge carried by 2mp in solution as also the surface charge of the sorbents the zero charge point of gon is 5 32 at a ph below which its surface is positively charged the pka value for 2mp is 5 96 and it gets protonated when ph falls below this value 7 an electrostatic interaction reaction mechanism inferred from ftir studies and confirmed by batch ph experimentation has been shown in fig s2 at ph 5 32 sorption is nullified by a repelling effect between similar charges on gon and 2mp 10 when ph rises above 5 96 to reach ph 7 the protonation potential of 2mp starts to fall although still interacting with a negatively charged deprotonated carboxyl group on gon surface to remove 2mp from solution 13 as ph of solution rises above 7 carboxyl groups on gon r cooh neutralize the mild alkalinity of the solution releasing protons into the solution a reduced supply of protons due to neutralization of alkalinity results in a gradual decrease in 2mp sorption onto gon when ph is further increased above 8 5 gon is bombarded with hydroxyl ions resulting in formation of wcrs on carboxyl groups thus drastically reducing its sorption capacity to 1 1 mg g 1 55 thus the 2mp 2mph transition is ph dependent and affects the extent of 2mp adsorption onto gon 3 3 4 system temperature temperature was varied in the range of 293 313 k the variation of sorption capacity of gon and sac with temperature was observed to be opposite to each other lowering the temperature curbed 2mp activity in aqueous solution and promoted sorption onto gon with removal percentage decreasing from 78 at 293 k to 72 at 313 k at a 2mp concentration of 5 mg l 1 on the other hand disintegration of structural integrity of sac with increasing temperature resulted in formation of finer pores and thus better mixing with 2mp this resulted in better sorption of 2mp on sac with increasing temperatures with removal percentage increasing from 76 5 at 293 k to 79 5 at 313 k additionally spherical and convective diffusion phenomena could be responsible for endothermic pore transport of 2mp on sac 48 it was seen that gon has the better removal efficiency per gram adsorbent dosage the changes in adsorptive capacity of the adsorbents have been shown in fig 8 3 3 5 initial concentration of 2mp initial 2mp concentration c0 was varied in the range of 2 5 20 mg l 1 at a fixed temperature as seen from fig 8 in case of gon adsorption at 303 k there was a steady decrease in relative removal percentage from 77 to 65 as c0 of 2mp was increased from 2 5 mg l 1 to 20 mg l 1 the differences in 2mp uptake at equilibrium diminished due to repelling nature of intraparticle effects and π π stacking amongst the 2mp molecules at increasing 2mp loadings the wcrs might be replaced by 2mp molecules the adsorption capacity on the other hand increased with increase in c0 of 2mp from 1 33 mg g 1 at 2 5 mg l 1 c0 to 8 56 mg g 1 at 20 mg l 1 c0 the decrease in observed removal was because of the fact that a given mass of adsorbent adsorbs only a fixed amount of adsorbate however the amount of 2mp adsorbed per unit adsorbent mass increased with an increase in c0 this is because of the decrease in the resistance to mass transfer of the solute from the solution a similar trend was observed for sac with removal varying from 0 125 mg g 1 at 2 5 mg l 1 c0 to 0 802 mg g 1 at 20 mg l 1 c0 with removal percentages of 80 and 64 respectively 3 3 6 adsorption kinetics equilibrium and thermodynamics the models used for kinetics experiments were pseudo first order pseudo second order and weber morris intraparticle diffusion respectively shown in eq 3 5 48 3 d q t d t k 1 q e q t 4 d q t d t k 2 q e q t 2 5 q t k 3 i t 1 2 c the pseudo second order model fit the experimental data of both sorbents best with the modelled adsorption capacity value being in agreement with the experimental capacity higher values of second order rate constant at low 2mp concentrations 5 10 mg l 1 are indicative of a system that is able to achieve equilibrium at a faster pace this was confirmed by the time of contact batch study a ten fold difference in qe was observed between gon and sac intraparticle diffusion was illustrated by the weber morris wm equation in both sorption systems the model parameters and their values are mentioned in table 3 both the sorbent systems had an intercept c in their first diffusion stages implying distinct macro mesopore and meso micropore intraparticle diffusion phases corroborate the system state from initial sorption conditions to reaching equilibrium was modelled using various non linear isotherm equations including langmuir lan freundlich fre redlich peterson rep toth tot and radke prausnitz rap respectively in eq 6 10 6 q e q m k i l c e e 1 k i l c e e 7 q e k i f c e e n 1 8 q e k i r c e e 1 a i r c e e β 9 q e q m c e e 1 k i t c e e t o 1 t o 10 q e k i p k p c e e 1 k i p c e e p information about their functioning application advantages and disadvantages have been discussed in previous works 60 61 the experimental adsorption data were plotted against predicted isotherm data obtained from different models and are represented in fig 9 a and b both plots showed concave curves with respect to x axis indicative of lower 2mp loadings used in the study residual analysis by chi square test x 2 for goodness of fit was undertaken to quantify the deviation in the predicted model results in comparison to batch studies and to decide which isotherm model closely replicated the sorption system 61 11 χ 2 k 1 d q e e q e p 2 q e p k the chi squared test is a very sensitive test since at lower residuals the value of x 2 is low and at high residuals its value rises steeply the residual calculation methods along with the obtained error values are mentioned in table 4 least values of residuals and highest value of correlation coefficient r2 at all temperatures are indicators of best fit it is evident after analysis of average residuals in table 4 and also from fig 9 a and b respectively that the 2mp gon system is best represented by the rep model while the 2mp sac system is best simulated by the lan model the langmuir model suggests a homogeneous single layer adsorption mechanism while the rep model suggests a hybrid multiple layer adsorption mechanism 60 for the gon 2mp system r p parameters at 303 k were found to be kir 10 0 l mg 1 β 0 311 and air 3 54 l mg 1 for the sac 2mp system we had langmuir parameters as qm 1 464 mg g 1 and kil 0 164 l mg 1 fig 10 shows the van t hoff thermodynamic plots for 2mp adsorption onto gon and sac gibb s free energy equation was modified to van t hoff equation shown in in eq 12 to find values of δh δs and δg 8 12 ln k a d δ g 0 r t δ s 0 r δ h 0 r 1 t results for thermodynamic studies were recorded in table 5 the negative and closely obtained values of δg0 in the range of 293 k 313 k indicated that sorption process was spontaneous and favourable for both the sorbent sorbate systems at all temperatures the free energy variation in gon 0 151 kj mol 1 between 293 k and 313 k seemed to be lesser affected by temperature extremes when compared to sac 1 578 kj mol 1 the kad for gon was also found to be one order of magnitude higher than sac implying better distribution and reaction efficiency based on δh0 the gon 2mp system was determined as exothermic and the sac 2mp system as endothermic the differing slope directions of the van t hoff plots for the adsorbents was an indication of this δh0 and δg0 values of both sorbents implied physical adsorption of 2mp taking place onto the surface the positive values of δs0 indicated randomness at the solid liquid interface with some structural changes in the adsorbate and adsorbent and an affinity of adsorbents towards 2mp free energy change was greater in case of gon because of higher surface area for sorption 3 3 7 understanding of selectivity the methyl group ch3 is non polar but when attached to pyridine ring has the ability to protonate a difference in electronegativity values of n 3 04 and the α c 2 55 in the pyridinic ring along with the sp2 hybridization of nc due to involvement of p orbitals results in development of polarity in the pyridinic ring which in turn affects the methyl group attached at α c the polarization potential of 2mp makes it more electropositive when compared to pyridine and benzene carboxylic group attached to the surface of gon has the greatest polarity so also group electronegativity compared to alcohols aldehydes and alkyl halides thus possessing the highest pulling potential of attracting a mildly polar protonated alkane methyl group 62 63 there is a stark decrease in polarity with increase in alkyl functional group chain length thus compared to alkanes and alkyl functionalized aromatics 2mp is expected to have higher polarity and better mobility thus we can see that in a purely organic matter environment 2mp has the potential to be selectively adsorbed onto gon 3 4 process optimization the coded factor values were chosen as x1 ph x2 m x3 c0 and x4 t the polynomial model developed for 2mp removal by gon can be written as eq 13 13 removal 71 815 1 801 x 1 6 208 x 2 5 2938 x 3 1 516 x 4 20 580 x 1 2 8 904 x 2 2 4 170 x 3 2 2 599 x 4 2 1 276 x 1 x 2 0 777 x 1 x 3 0 728 x 1 x 4 2 969 x 2 x 3 3 331 x 2 x 4 7 972 x 3 x 4 variance analysis showed that developing a model with terms greater than two factor linear interactions did not result in a good fit coded values cv are convertible to experimentally used values ev by using eq 14 14 c v e v u l 2 u l 2 γ a determination coefficient value of r2 0 992 mathematically confirmed the model s ability to simulate real world adsorption of 2mp onto gon with controlled variation lagrange s criterion was utilized for determination of optimum conditions for maximum 2mp removal predicted by the model and yielded a negative function value 43 gradient vectors with respect to each factor were developed and solved simultaneously to obtain optimal coded values of x1 0 013 x2 0 522 x3 0 478 and x4 0 704 experimental values relating to these codes are ph 7 04 m 1 80 g l 1 c0 16 89 mg l 1 and t 293 82 k the model successfully predicted 72 1 removal of 2mp upon applying these conditions to batch experimentation the removal percentage obtained was in excess of the model predicted removal by 0 71 thus corroborating with the findings 3 4 1 impact of factors the sign of each regression coefficient in the yield equation has either a constructive or a derogatory effect on 2mp removal the regression coefficients can gauge the impact of a unit change in variable value on the predicted removal a positive change in level of x1 and x2 had an incremental impact while x3 and x4 had a decremental impact a pareto chart was plotted using the absolute values of the coefficients in fig 11 the terms of ph x1 2 and m x2 2 aided in better 2mp removal contributing 21 and 7 to model yield respectively the factors shown in the plot accounted for 96 of the total impact on removal further a normal probability plot factor effects was plotted in fig s4 the central effects formed a straight line with a slight left skew to the plot implying normally distribution the linear x1 quadratic x1 2 x2 2 and interaction x3 x4 x1 x3 effects were most disruptive to process stability due to their sparse occurrence and notable deviation from the line 64 3 4 2 response surface analysis visual representation of 4d factor effects is difficult in a 3d space the representation of eq 13 was thus limited to effects occurring from factors taken two at a time resulting in the generation of 4c2 equations comprising of linear squared and interaction terms the factors omitted from change in a particular run were maintained at central values which are coded to zero the interaction effects observed from each combination of factors on the 2mp sorption is represented in fig 12 a f on analysis of each response surface generated and its associated contour it was seen that ph x1 had the most substantial impact on removal of 2mp by gon a small change in x1 manifested as an increase in surface curvature in fig 12 a c the most suitable result was attained at a coded value of x1 0 which corresponds to neutral ph of solution corroborating results obtained from batch experiments 3 4 3 adequacy of model formulation the change observed between experimental 2mp removal and model predicted removal is called the error in prediction upon plotting the normal probability graph of model errors it was seen that a randomly distributed cloud of points was formed not adhering to a particular trend fig 13 a this confirmed the normal distribution of modelled data implying good fit accuracy of the model was further put to test by plotting a graph of experimental and modelled removal data fig 13 b then running regression analysis a linear relation between the datasets was observed with regression analysis confirming that an accurate mathematical relation existed between the two datasets with an r2 0 986 3 4 4 model validation the model was run five times at zero centre levels of coded factors to test its stability in generating repeatable and reproducible results this data was compared to experimental adsorption results and noted in serial numbers 22 26 of table 1 further testing was carried out by with random values for factors chosen from within their range serial numbers 27 30 with the main aim of checking compatibility with experimental results the model successfully predicted percentages for 2mp removal with an average absolute error percentage of 0 871 the capability of the model to accurately predict experimental results was thus verified 4 conclusion this study concludes based on batch studies and mathematical optimization that gon can be used to replace traditional adsorbent sac in treatment of industrial solvent 2mp in the concentration range of 2 5 20 mg l 1 a safe thermally controlled process for synthesis of exfoliated carboxyl graphene oxide nanocomposite was suggested characterization of gon was used to enunciate the structure crystallite particle size and mechanism of 2mp sorption the exfoliation carboxyl functionalization and π π forces in gon are responsible for its increase in adsorption capacity sac on the other hand relies solely on electrostatic interactions for adsorption of 2mp gon showed ten times the adsorption capacity 8 78 mg g 1 at one tenth the sorbent dosage 1 5 g l 1 of sac reducing the footprint of spent adsorbent the adsorbent 2mp equilibrium was highly ph dependant with maximum removal occurring at ph 7 thermodynamic studies kinetics and equilibrium analyses all elucidate the structural and chemical superiority of gon as an adsorbent the doehlert optimization model showed that quadratic effects of ph and m most affected 2mp sorption onto gon solution ph of 7 was confirmed by modelling to be the optimal ph of operation experimental and predicted datasets were corelated by r2 0 986 resulting in low modeling error optimal factor conditions yielded a removal of 72 10 effects of the interaction between more than two factors on removal was found insignificant the success of the model was validated by comparing outcomes of repeated constant value experimental runs and random value runs gon was thus successful in removal of 2mp although for industrial application a study of interfering solvent interactions is necessary declaration of competing interest the

13696,although the influence of salinity on the aggregation of anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox granules has been investigated the mechanism behind its effect remains poorly understood herein the changes in the surface characteristics extracellular polymeric substance eps components and eps surface groups of anammox granules were studied at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl salinity to elucidate this mechanism the results showed that as the salt concentration in wastewater increased 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the size of anammox granules decreased 2 85 0 20 mm 2 17 0 13 mm and 1 75 0 17 mm respectively the aggregation index ai of sludge decreased 21 3 1 5 14 6 0 8 and 7 1 0 9 respectively and the ratio of extracellular protein pn to extracellular polysaccharide ps decreased 8 8 6 2 and 4 2 respectively analysis of the surface free energy of the anammox granules based on extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo curves showed that increasing salinity decreased the zeta potential and hydrophobicity of the sludge but increased the repulsive barrier in the sludge fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy showed that increasing salinity decreased the anammox granule hydrophobicity by changing the eps surface groups and the reduction in hydrophobicity was not conducing to the aggregation of anammox granules these results provide further useful guidance for practical applications of the anammox process to saline wastewater treatment keywords anammox granules salinity aggregation performance surface characteristics xdlvo theory extracellular polymeric substance 1 introduction in comparison with traditional nitrification denitrification anammox is favored for wastewater treatment because of its higher denitrification efficiency lack of a need for an additional carbon source low energy consumption and low sludge production 1 however the complexity of wastewater composition and the sensitivity of anammox bacteria to their environment limit the application of the anammox process high salinity wastewater is commonly produced in many industries such as food processing pharmaceutical manufacturing textile printing and dyeing and livestock and poultry breeding 2 3 since nacl is the most common salt in nature nacl is often used as the main salt in the culture medium of salt tolerant sludge or halophilic microorganisms 4 and nacl was usually used to simulate saline wastewater to explore the impact of salinity on wastewater treatment 5 6 salinity can stress microorganisms by destroying their cell walls resulting in the inhibition of many enzyme activities and even causing cell lysis 7 8 due to the advantages of anammox granules such as its ability to retain large amounts of biomass good settling performance and strong impact resistance using anammox granules to treat saline wastewater has impressive application prospects it has been reported that anammox granules has a higher aggregation tendency than other types of sludge 9 sludge aggregation can efficiently increase the retention of anammox bacteria and reduce the adverse shock impact of environmental conditions 10 therefore anammox granules with high aggregation performance can be used to treat large amounts of high salinity wastewater however previous studies have shown that the aggregation performance of granular sludge was affected by salinity high salinity 30 g l nacl could reduce the hydrophobicity of sludge surface thereby inhibiting the granulation and aggregation of the anammox granules 11 in addition the salinity 20 g l nacl may increase repulsive electrostatic forces resulting in poor sludge aggregation and a swollen granular structure 12 oppositely some scholars hold the opinion that the aggregation of anammox granules was enhanced at 20 g l nacl salinity condition 13 and other scholars claimed that the effect of na on the aggregation of anaerobic granules was slight and the evolution of viscosity and zeta potential was also not significantly impacted by the increasing na concentration 14 in short the above results show that the effect of salinity on the aggregation performance of anammox granules is controversial and even contradictory some uncertainties still exist and limit the application of anammox to saline wastewater treatment therefore further investigations are needed to understand the mechanism of salinity affecting sludge aggregation extracellular polymeric substance eps generated from bacteria play a major role in sludge aggregation 9 researchers have studied the influence of salinity on eps formation and composition in anammox granules and the mechanism of action of eps in sludge aggregation 9 15 the salt concentration is considered an essential factor influencing eps formation and composition interestingly some studies have revealed that the eps contents compositions and protein structure can be adjusted to help alleviate salt stress 11 under high salinity conditions eps aggregate on the cell surface affecting the hydrophobicity of the cell surface and causing changes in water intake and salt secretion which in turn affect the cell aggregation state and promote granule formation 16 however few researchers have studied the associations among the cell surface properties hydrophobicity eps contents and functional groups of anammox granules under various salinity conditions to understand the changes in the aggregation of anammox granules caused by salt to fully understand the mechanism of action by evaluating the relationship of anammox granule characteristics with salinity granules were collected from an anammox expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor under various salinity conditions for analysis through expanded derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theoretical analysis the main functional forces involved in the aggregation process were determined at various salinities in addition the changes in eps components and functional groups were studied to explain the changes in the aggregation of anammox granules with changes in salinity this study is expected to provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for the efficient treatment of high salinity sewage with anammox granules 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors and synthetic wastewater the anammox reaction was carried out at three salinities of 0 15 and 30 g l nacl in three egsb reactors with the same specifications r1 r2 and r3 respectively each reactor was made of plexiglass and its total effective volume was 1 86 l including a reaction zone of 1 5 l and a sedimentation zone of 0 35 l a schematic diagram of an anammox egsb reactor is shown in fig s1 the influent and reflux water flowed into each reactor from the bottom via a peristaltic pump each reactor had a constant temperature water bath that controlled the temperature at 32 1 c and aluminum foil tape was wrapped outside the reactor to protect it from light synthetic wastewater was the influent to each reactor and had wastewater quality indexes matching those reported by fang 11 the ph of the influent was 7 8 8 0 the chemicals used to prepare the trace element solutions were of analytical grade and the other chemicals were of commercial grade saline wastewater was prepared with nacl commercial grade standard methods 17 were used to analyze indicators such as nh4 n no2 n total nitrogen tn and volatile suspended solids vss 2 2 granular sludge inoculation the seed sludges of r1 r2 and r3 were inoculated from the laboratory anammox egsb reactor r0 which was operated at 0 g l nacl and a nitrogen volume load of 2 58 kg m3 d for one year after r1 r2 and r3 were inoculated with granular sludge they were all stably operated under the conditions of 0 g l nacl and a total nitrogen load nlr of 2 39 kg m3 d the average removal rates of nh4 n no2 n and tn were 91 4 0 8 98 0 0 7 and 88 5 1 5 respectively then r1 r2 and r3 were adjusted to maintain stable operation at salinities of 0 g l 15 g l and 30 g l nacl respectively during stable reactor operation most of the anammox granules were concentrated within approximately the bottom 10 cm of the egsb reactor fig s1 samples of anammox granules were taken from r1 r2 and r3 via a sampling port located 5 cm away from the bottom of the egsb reactor fig s1 thus the anammox granules samples collected from reactors were representative and comparable 2 3 surface characteristics of the anammox granules 2 3 1 particle size because anammox granules are relatively large the particle size was analyzed by an image analysis method that is used in the measurement of large particles the method details are as follows sludge samples were spread onto 9 cm diameter petri dishes photographs were taken with a digital camera and then nano measurer 1 2 software was used to determine and calibrate the anammox granule diameter 11 18 finally the obtained sludge samples were sieved through a 12 mesh sieve and used for subsequent eps extraction and surface characteristic analysis 2 3 2 aggregation index ai an ai was introduced to characterize the aggregation of anammox granules in this study via the method of hou et al 9 which involves measuring changes in turbidity the details are described in text s1 of the supplementary material 2 3 3 zeta potential and contact angle the zeta potential of anammox granules was measured according to the method reported by hou et al 9 the anammox granule samples were ground and homogenized into a sludge suspension which was dispersed in 10 ml of 0 1 m nacl a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk was used to measure the zeta potential of the anammox granule samples at 25 c this test was repeated 10 times and the average was taken a contact angle measurement instrument dsa 100 kruss germany was used to measure the contact angles between the anammox granules and three liquids distilled water formamide and 1 bromonaphthalene the contact angle between anammox granules and distilled water was used to characterize the hydrophobicity of the granules the contact angles between the anammox granules and distilled water formamide and 1 bromonaphthalene were measured to calculate the surface tension and its different action items of anammox granules and then calculate the interface force and interface free energy of anammox granules the method followed that reported by liu et al 19 and each sample was measured 10 times to obtain the average 2 4 surface thermodynamics and xdlvo curve analysis based on the contact angles of the anammox granules obtained under three various salinity conditions a thermodynamic analysis method 20 could be used to obtain the surface thermodynamic calculation parameters including the hamaker constant a b l b the van der waals free energy δ g b l l w the lewis acid base hydration free energy δ g b l a b and the interface adsorption free energy δ g a d h by comparing these indicators the influence of salinity on the superficial characteristics of anammox granules could be further analyzed the measured zeta potential data combined with the above surface thermodynamic parameters were used to calculate the van der waals adsorption term w a static repulsion term w r and acid base hydration term w a b from the xdlvo theory 20 this method assumed that the bacterial cells were spheroids the detailed methodology and calculation steps are presented in texts s2 and s3 respectively of the supplementary material 2 5 eps extraction and measurement 2 5 1 extraction and contents determination of eps a cation exchange resin method 21 was used to extract eps from the anammox granules and the detailed method is described in text s4 of the supplementary material part of the eps extract was directly used to determine the contents of eps and for 3d eem test the other part was freeze dried at 35 c for one week prior to analysis by ftir spectroscopy studies of eps focus mostly on pn and ps which are the predominant constituents of eps 22 24 pn and ps represent 20 80 and 20 55 of the eps mass respectively and count for 70 80 of total organic carbon in eps 22 24 the surface charge hydrophobicity and spatial structure of the aggregates are mainly affected by the pn and ps in eps 25 the total amount of eps was calculated as the sum of the pn and ps contents the modified lowry colorimetric method was used to determine the pn content in eps 11 and the glucose based anthrone sulfate colorimetric method was used to determine the ps content in eps 9 the pn and ps contents were averaged over 5 parallel sample measurements 2 5 2 ftir and 3d eem spectral analyses eps powder 10 0 mg was mixed with ftir grade kbr in a mass ratio of 1 200 and then analyzed by ftir spectroscopy tensor 27 bruker germany all the ftir spectra were normalized after acquisition to a maximum emission of 1 0 the software peakfit 4 12 was used to analyze the amide i region of the infrared spectra to determine the secondary protein structures and relative protein content then according to the second derivative of the ftir bands various types of hydrogen bonds were identified after deconvolution of the broad peak at 3700 3000 cm 1 a gaussian fitting model was applied to the deconvoluted ftir peaks in origin 9 0 software the 3d eem spectra of eps were recorded with a fluorescence photometer f 7000 fl hitachi japan and the injection volume was 3 ml raman scattering of water was corrected using pure water as a blank during the measurement the excitation wavelength was scanned between 200 and 400 nm with a sampling interval of 5 nm and the emission spectrum was scanned between 220 and 500 nm in 5 nm increments with a scanning speed of 3000 nm min in order to more clearly reflect the 3d eem spectral characteristics of eps we have eliminated the rayleigh scattering from the 3d eem spectra of eps and have further optimized the data 3 results 3 1 reactor performance and granular sludge characteristics three anammox egsb reactors with different salinities were operated stably and sampled over the course of the study the average tn removal rates of r1 r2 and r3 were 88 0 0 7 87 8 0 4 and 87 1 0 6 respectively the reactors achieved good nitrogen removal under high salinity conditions indicating that the anammox granules were salt tolerant to some extent which was similar to the results of wang et al 3 during the stable operation of r1 r2 and r3 the ratio of ammonia nitrogen consumed to nitrite nitrogen consumed to nitrate nitrogen produced was 1 1 138 0 154 1 1 136 0 146 and 1 1 130 0 143 respectively these ratios were close to the value of 1 1 146 0 161 stoichiometry of the anammox reaction reported by lotti et al 26 revealing that high anammox activity led to tn removal at the three salinity levels in the anammox egsb reactors photographs of the anammox granules at the tested salinities are shown in fig s2 the appearance of the anammox granules was consistent most were ellipsoidal in shape with an uneven surface iron red color and dense structure as the salinity increased the color of the anammox bacteria darkened which was similar to the results of lu et al 15 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the average granule size was 2 85 0 20 mm 2 17 0 13 mm and 1 75 0 17 mm respectively the average granule size gradually decreased with increasing salt concentration 3 2 ai of anammox granules to investigate the influence of salinity on the aggregation capacity of anammox granules the aggregation degree of the granules at various salt concentrations was measured and the results are shown in fig 1 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the ai was 21 3 1 5 14 6 0 8 and 7 1 0 9 respectively it showed that the aggregation performance of anammox granules under salinity conditions was inhibited which is consistent with the change of particle size studies have reported that eps can change the surface chemical properties hydrophobicity and other physicochemical properties of granules 9 to reveal the mechanism behind the decrease in aggregation with increasing salinity the surface characteristics of anammox granules eps contents eps functional groups in anammox granules at various salinities were studied 3 3 zeta potential and contact angle the zeta potential of anammox granules at various salinities is shown in fig 2 at salinities of 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the zeta potential of anammox granules was 19 2 1 0 mv 22 5 1 2 mv and 23 6 1 8 mv respectively this shows that the surface of anammox granules is electronegative and that the electronegativity increases with increasing nacl salinity in addition the significant correlation between the ai and zeta potential p 0 01 table s1 indicates that an increase in electronegativity is not conducive to the aggregation of anammox granules the hydrophobicity of sludge can be expressed by the contact angle between sludge and distilled water and the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface is the driving force of granule aggregation 27 as shown in table 1 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the contact angles between anammox granules and distilled water were 85 56 0 67 73 82 0 13 and 70 30 1 24 respectively which indicates that the hydrophobicity of anammox granules decreases with increasing salinity in addition the significant correlation between ai and hydrophobicity p 0 01 table s1 indicates that the reduction in hydrophobicity is not conducive to the aggregation of anammox granules 3 4 analysis of the surface free energy of anammox granules based on the xdlvo curve the surface thermodynamic indexes of anammox granules at various salinities table 2 were calculated by substituting the zeta potential of the anammox granules and the contact angle between the anammox granules and distilled water formamide and 1 bromonaphthalene into the relevant formula given in the text s2 of the supplementary material the value of δ g a d h can characterize the interaction between microorganisms and water molecules 20 generally the interaction between water molecules has a δ g a d h value of 0 mj m2 a δ g a d h 0 indicates that the interaction between microorganisms and water molecules surpasses the interaction between water molecules microorganisms tend to bind with water thus showing a hydrophilic effect conversely when δ g a d h 0 the microorganisms exhibit a hydrophobic effect it can be seen from table 2 that the δ g a d h values of the anammox granules under the three salinities were all negative and as the salinity increased δ g a d h increased 66 18 2 04 mj m2 22 72 1 57 mj m2 and 19 32 1 11 mj m2 which indicated that the hydrophobic interaction of the anammox granules weakened as the salinity increased at the same salinity conditions the δ g b l a b of anammox granules were smaller than those of δ g b l l w δ g b l l w was a key factor for determining δ g a d h that is δ g b l a b played an important role in the aggregation process of anammox granules in addition with increasing salinity the δ g b l l w value and δ g b l a b value of the anammox granules gradually increased and the rate of increased in δ g b l a b was obviously larger than that in δ g b l l w to further study the aggregation mechanism under salinity conditions xdlvo theory was applied to analyze the relationship between various interaction energies and the separation distance h between the cells 9 the w a w r and w a b values of the anammox granules were calculated from the obtained thermodynamic index data and the w t equation for the anammox granules was obtained by adding these three terms fig 3 shows the xdlvo curves for the anammox granules under various salinities the aggregation characteristics of anammox granules are related to w t w a w r and w a b but various interaction energies are interdependent and significantly varied as shown in fig 3 the w t curves of anammox granules at all the tested salinities 0 15 and 30 g l nacl had potential energy barriers preventing mutual attraction between granules and the energy barrier increased with increasing salinity in this paper although the changes in the w a w r and w a b curves for the anammox granules were similar under the different salinity conditions notably the change in w a b was more obvious than that in w a and w r with an increase in salinity therefore w a b which determines the hydrophobic force played a key role in the aggregation of anammox granules at the tested salinities the w a b of anammox granules was negative and the w a b increased with increasing salinity indicating that the hydrophobic interactions among anammox granules weakened as the salinity increased thus salinity increases adversely impacted the aggregation of anammox granules which was consistent with the ai results fig 1 3 5 eps components and contents the adhesion and aggregation performance of microbial cells is closely related to eps 5 9 to further study the reasons for the decrease in sludge aggregation due to the surface characteristic changes as salinity increased the changes in the components and contents of eps in the reaction system were analyzed fig 4 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the pn content in eps was 90 45 2 11 mg g vss 76 90 1 70 mg g vss and 65 10 2 13 mg g vss the ps content was 10 26 0 16 mg g vss 12 31 0 09 mg g vss and 15 43 0 32 mg g vss the total eps content was 100 72 2 27 mg g vss 89 21 1 79 mg g vss 80 53 2 45 mg g vss and the pn ps ratio was 8 8 6 2 and 4 2 respectively these results indicated that salinity promoted the production of polysaccharides in anammox granules and inhibited the production of proteins thus changing the composition of eps fang et al 11 obtained similar results while researching the salinity influence on anammox granules 3 6 ftir spectra of eps although the above results indicated that the aggregation of anammox granules decreased as the salinity increased mainly as a result of changes in hydrophobic interactions the role of hydrophobicity in this mechanism needed to be further explored therefore ftir spectroscopy was used to observe the functional groups of anammox granule eps at different salinities and analyzed the changes an ftir spectrum of the anammox granule eps is shown in fig 5 the position and number of some eps functional groups changed with increasing salinity the hydrophobic c h groups in alkane organics and polysaccharides produced stretching vibrations near 2932 cm 1 28 and the ratio of the peak of anammox granules to 15 g l nacl or 30 g l nacl was less than that to 0 g l nacl the peak near 1635 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of co groups in proteins 9 and this peak was within the region corresponding to the β sheet secondary protein structure 29 β sheet structures promote aggregation in anammox sludge but the proportion of the peak at 1635 cm 1 decreased obviously with increasing salinity the peak near 1455 cm 1 indicated the presence of uronic acid 30 and the peak ratio of anammox granules at 30 g l nacl was higher than that at 0 g l nacl the peak near 1398 cm 1 was related to the bending vibration of hydrophobic ch2 groups 31 and the proportion of this peak decreased obviously with increasing salinity the peaks at approximately 1033 cm 1 were attributed to coh and co groups in polysaccharides 11 and this peak proportion increased obviously with increasing salinity it is also worth noting that the eps we extracted from anammox granules were mainly located at 3700 3000 cm 1 and the wide overlapping peaks in this area indicated the existence of hydrogen bonds within the eps 32 the higher the proportion of hydrogen bonds in the system is the stronger the interaction between molecules and the more viscous the system 33 34 fig 5 shows that the ratio of the peaks at approximately 3285 cm 1 decreased significantly with increasing salinity which indicated that the proportion of hydrogen bonds in the eps of anammox granules was reduced and the sludge did not easily agglomerate hydrogen bonds one of the main aggregation cohesion forces in eps have been reported to play an important role in promoting the aggregation of sludge and maintaining the structure of sludge 32 35 36 in the deconvoluted ftir spectra fig s3 the percentages of hydrogen bonds in the eps functional groups were 25 82 23 26 and 18 41 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl respectively the hydrogen bonds in the eps of anammox granules were divided into intermolecular hydrogen bonds molecular hydrogen bonds and free hydroxyl groups table s2 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the percentage of intermolecular hydrogen bonds to hydrogen bonds was 55 66 49 18 and 48 50 respectively the percentage of intermolecular hydrogen bonds decreases under salinity conditions which indicates that salinity is not conducive to the aggregation of anammox granules 35 36 the ftir spectroscopy results indicated the presence of uronic acid hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups in eps these groups are the main determinants of the electronegativity and hydrophilicity of eps 37 38 as the salinity increased the zeta potential and the number of hydrophilic functional groups increased while the number of hydrophobic functional groups decreased therefore sludge aggregation was inhibited the hydrophobicity of protein has an important influence on the surface hydrophobicity of granular sludge and the change of protein hydrophobicity can be well characterized by the analysis of protein secondary structure 9 the percentage of protein secondary structures in eps of anammox granules under various salinity conditions is shown in table s3 the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil ratio is often used to characterize secondary protein structures 9 39 a low ratio indicates a loose protein structure and easily exposed internal hydrophobic groups 9 as shown in table s3 the α helix β folding random coil ratio increased with increasing salinity this result indicated that the hydrophobic secondary protein structures in eps were affected by salinity in such a way that reduced the exposure of hydrophobic groups in eps and therefore the hydrophobicity of the eps adversely impacting the aggregation of the anammox granules 3 7 3d eem spectra of eps the boundaries of the fluorescent areas and the substances represented by each area in the 3d eem spectra are based on the research of chen et al 40 fig 6 shows that the eem spectra of eps at various salinities all contained four distinct peaks peak a was situated in region ii ex em 200 255 335 380 nm which corresponded to tryptophan protein substances peak b was situated in region i ex em 200 250 280 335 nm which corresponded to tyrosine protein substances peak c was situated in region v ex em 250 335 280 380 nm which corresponded to humic acid like substances and peak d was situated in region iv ex em 250 380 380 540 nm which corresponded to soluble microbial byproducts table 3 shows the eem spectral parameters of the eps of anammox granules at the three salinities as shown in table 3 with increasing salinity the emission wavelength of peak a blueshifted and the absorption wavelength redshifted and then blueshifted the emission wavelength of peak b was blueshifted and the absorption wavelength redshifted and then blueshifted the shifting of the maximum absorption peak wavelength of the absorption band for organic substances to longer wavelengths is called a redshift and the opposite shifting is called a blueshift 41 42 a redshift is generally due to an increase in carbonyl carboxyl hydroxyl and amine groups in the fluorophore 41 a blueshift is related to a decrease in the percentage of functional groups such as aromatic rings and conjugated bonds in the fluorophore 42 and the fragmentation of large organic particles into smaller fragments 43 the redshift and blueshift of the fluorescence peaks indicated that the increase in salinity altered the functional groups of microbial metabolites which further affected the sludge aggregation a fluorescence peak may be composed of superimposed signals from multiple groups and may contain multiple fluorescence peaks in the same fluorescence region but the fluorescence regional integration fri used by chen 40 can address possible overlaps in a spectrum the percentages of fri regions corresponding to eps in anammox granules at various salinities are shown in fig 7 φ1 n denotes the fluorescence region for tyrosine type proteins φ2 n denotes the fluorescence region for tryptophan type proteins φ3 n denotes the fluorescence region for fulvic acid φ4 n denotes the fluorescence region for lysoid like microorganism byproduct and φ5 n denotes the fluorescence region for humic substances fig 7 shows that the ratios of these eem fluorescence regions varied with salinity the ratios were ranked as φ4 n φ2 n φ1 n φ3 n φ5 n at 0 g l nacl and φ1 n φ4 n φ2 n φ3 n φ5 n at 15 g l and 30 g l nacl under the same salinity conditions the proportions of the eps fluorescence regions for the anammox granules were in the same order as the salinity increased the percentage of φ1 n species increased and the percentages of φ3 n and φ5 n species decreased 4 discussion aggregation mechanisms of granular sludge are very complex involving the influence of operating conditions and cooperation between bacteria aggregation is the result of a comprehensive effect of physicochemical interactions and biological interactions the physicochemical interactions include van der waals attraction electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic interactions caused by the electric double layer outside the cell 44 biological interactions mainly refer to the production of eps communication and competition between cells etc the physicochemical interactions can be characterized by the xdlvo theory which is considered to be the basic theory of cell aggregation 44 although this theory can explain the stability of a colloidal solution well it ignores the influence of biological interactions on the surface properties of sludge during sludge aggregation biological interactions can be characterized by the theory of eps action because the most important biological interaction that causes cell aggregation is the production of eps therefore this article discusses the mechanism of anammox granuler aggregation from two perspectives xdlvo theory and eps action theory metal cations are widely regarded as important factors affecting sludge aggregation based on xdlvo theory the surface of sludge is generally negatively charged according to the xdlvo theory when two surfaces carry the same charges there is a free energy barrier between them that acts as a repulsive force the repulsive force formed between the sludge granules is the main factor hindering their aggregation 45 this repulsion is reported to be affected by metallic cations 45 the increase in ionic strength 0 to about 0 1 0 2 m will reduce the electrostatic repulsion by compressing the electric double layer thereby facilitating the adhesion and aggregation of sludge 45 46 however if the system exceeds this ionic strength range this will either enhance or reduce the sludge aggregation performance 45 the repulsion potential of anammox granules increased and the hydrophobic interaction decreased with increasing nacl salinity based on the xdlvo theory described in this paper this result is consistent with the reduction in granular sludge zeta potential and hydrophobicity this may be due to the exchange of na in wastewater with multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 in granular sludge 47 48 so that the thickness of the diffusion layer increases resulting in the double layer thickening increasing the sludge repulsion potential which hinders the aggregation of granular sludge the aggregation of granular sludge is closely related to the biological effects mediated by eps which involve bacteria embedding in gel material with cross linked eps as the matrix 48 eps covering the surface of sludge can change the surface properties of microbial aggregates such as the hydrophobicity and zeta potential thereby affecting the sludge aggregation it is reported that ps has negatively charged and hydrophilic functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and phosphoric acid groups 25 49 while pn contains positively charged and hydrophobic amino acid functional groups such as alanine cysteine and valine 9 50 as the nacl salinity increases the reduction in pn ps may reduce the relative hydrophobicity and zeta potential of the sludge thereby hindering the aggregation of anammox granules in fact eps can effectively inhibit the interaction between hydrophilic groups and water molecules with the strong forces such as hydrogen bonds and improve the surface properties of granules by adhering and fixing hydrophobic substances 51 furthermore the ftir and 3d eem data showed that with increasing of nacl salinity the percentage of hydrophobic fulvic acid like substances and humic acid like substances in eps decreased while the percentages of more hydrophilic functional groups such as uronic acid hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups increased therefore salinity affects the hydrophobicity and electronegativity of the sludge surface by changing the protein secondary structure hydrogen bonding system and functional groups content thereby reducing the aggregation performance of granular sludge these results are important for studying the influence of salinity on the aggregation of anammox granules based on bacterial surface characteristics and the eps composition and functional groups first microbial aggregates formed by anammox bacteria through aggregation are central to ensuring effective aggregation an elucidated mechanism can provide a theoretical basis for aggregation in anammox sludge and the retention of functional bacteria in the anammox facilitated treatment of high salinity wastewater second it is possible to create environmental conditions that are more conducive to the aggregation of anammox granules by regulating the conditions of the reactor influent accelerating the aggregation of anammox granules and shortening the granulation time thus improving the efficiency of sewage treatment in addition a hydrophobic material or carrier to which bacteria can adhere can be developed thereby promoting the application of anammox treatment related research is underway to improve the aggregation performance of anammox sludge and to achieve better granulation of anammox bacteria 5 conclusion the changes in surface characteristics eps components and eps functional groups of anammox granules at various nacl salinity conditions were studied to investigate the influence of nacl salinity on the aggregation of anammox granules as the salinity increased the diameter aggregation index zeta potential and hydrophobicity of anammox granules decreased the analyses of the surface free energy based on xdlvo theory showed that an increase in salinity resulted in reducing the hydrophobic interactions and increasing the repulsive barrier of anammox granules aggregation furthermore the production of polysaccharides was promoted but the protein was inhibited at various nacl salinity conditions consequently the components of eps changed besides more proofs for reduction in aggregation performance due to high salinity from ftir and 3d eem experiments suggested that the percentages of intermolecular hydrogen bonds the secondary structure of hydrophobic proteins and hydrophobic fluorescent products in eps among anammox granules decreased with increasing salinity author contribution the first and corresponding authors contributed to the idea planning

13696,although the influence of salinity on the aggregation of anaerobic ammonia oxidation anammox granules has been investigated the mechanism behind its effect remains poorly understood herein the changes in the surface characteristics extracellular polymeric substance eps components and eps surface groups of anammox granules were studied at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl salinity to elucidate this mechanism the results showed that as the salt concentration in wastewater increased 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the size of anammox granules decreased 2 85 0 20 mm 2 17 0 13 mm and 1 75 0 17 mm respectively the aggregation index ai of sludge decreased 21 3 1 5 14 6 0 8 and 7 1 0 9 respectively and the ratio of extracellular protein pn to extracellular polysaccharide ps decreased 8 8 6 2 and 4 2 respectively analysis of the surface free energy of the anammox granules based on extended derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo curves showed that increasing salinity decreased the zeta potential and hydrophobicity of the sludge but increased the repulsive barrier in the sludge fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy and three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem fluorescence spectroscopy showed that increasing salinity decreased the anammox granule hydrophobicity by changing the eps surface groups and the reduction in hydrophobicity was not conducing to the aggregation of anammox granules these results provide further useful guidance for practical applications of the anammox process to saline wastewater treatment keywords anammox granules salinity aggregation performance surface characteristics xdlvo theory extracellular polymeric substance 1 introduction in comparison with traditional nitrification denitrification anammox is favored for wastewater treatment because of its higher denitrification efficiency lack of a need for an additional carbon source low energy consumption and low sludge production 1 however the complexity of wastewater composition and the sensitivity of anammox bacteria to their environment limit the application of the anammox process high salinity wastewater is commonly produced in many industries such as food processing pharmaceutical manufacturing textile printing and dyeing and livestock and poultry breeding 2 3 since nacl is the most common salt in nature nacl is often used as the main salt in the culture medium of salt tolerant sludge or halophilic microorganisms 4 and nacl was usually used to simulate saline wastewater to explore the impact of salinity on wastewater treatment 5 6 salinity can stress microorganisms by destroying their cell walls resulting in the inhibition of many enzyme activities and even causing cell lysis 7 8 due to the advantages of anammox granules such as its ability to retain large amounts of biomass good settling performance and strong impact resistance using anammox granules to treat saline wastewater has impressive application prospects it has been reported that anammox granules has a higher aggregation tendency than other types of sludge 9 sludge aggregation can efficiently increase the retention of anammox bacteria and reduce the adverse shock impact of environmental conditions 10 therefore anammox granules with high aggregation performance can be used to treat large amounts of high salinity wastewater however previous studies have shown that the aggregation performance of granular sludge was affected by salinity high salinity 30 g l nacl could reduce the hydrophobicity of sludge surface thereby inhibiting the granulation and aggregation of the anammox granules 11 in addition the salinity 20 g l nacl may increase repulsive electrostatic forces resulting in poor sludge aggregation and a swollen granular structure 12 oppositely some scholars hold the opinion that the aggregation of anammox granules was enhanced at 20 g l nacl salinity condition 13 and other scholars claimed that the effect of na on the aggregation of anaerobic granules was slight and the evolution of viscosity and zeta potential was also not significantly impacted by the increasing na concentration 14 in short the above results show that the effect of salinity on the aggregation performance of anammox granules is controversial and even contradictory some uncertainties still exist and limit the application of anammox to saline wastewater treatment therefore further investigations are needed to understand the mechanism of salinity affecting sludge aggregation extracellular polymeric substance eps generated from bacteria play a major role in sludge aggregation 9 researchers have studied the influence of salinity on eps formation and composition in anammox granules and the mechanism of action of eps in sludge aggregation 9 15 the salt concentration is considered an essential factor influencing eps formation and composition interestingly some studies have revealed that the eps contents compositions and protein structure can be adjusted to help alleviate salt stress 11 under high salinity conditions eps aggregate on the cell surface affecting the hydrophobicity of the cell surface and causing changes in water intake and salt secretion which in turn affect the cell aggregation state and promote granule formation 16 however few researchers have studied the associations among the cell surface properties hydrophobicity eps contents and functional groups of anammox granules under various salinity conditions to understand the changes in the aggregation of anammox granules caused by salt to fully understand the mechanism of action by evaluating the relationship of anammox granule characteristics with salinity granules were collected from an anammox expanded granular sludge bed egsb reactor under various salinity conditions for analysis through expanded derjaguin landau verwey overbeek xdlvo theoretical analysis the main functional forces involved in the aggregation process were determined at various salinities in addition the changes in eps components and functional groups were studied to explain the changes in the aggregation of anammox granules with changes in salinity this study is expected to provide a theoretical basis and practical reference for the efficient treatment of high salinity sewage with anammox granules 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactors and synthetic wastewater the anammox reaction was carried out at three salinities of 0 15 and 30 g l nacl in three egsb reactors with the same specifications r1 r2 and r3 respectively each reactor was made of plexiglass and its total effective volume was 1 86 l including a reaction zone of 1 5 l and a sedimentation zone of 0 35 l a schematic diagram of an anammox egsb reactor is shown in fig s1 the influent and reflux water flowed into each reactor from the bottom via a peristaltic pump each reactor had a constant temperature water bath that controlled the temperature at 32 1 c and aluminum foil tape was wrapped outside the reactor to protect it from light synthetic wastewater was the influent to each reactor and had wastewater quality indexes matching those reported by fang 11 the ph of the influent was 7 8 8 0 the chemicals used to prepare the trace element solutions were of analytical grade and the other chemicals were of commercial grade saline wastewater was prepared with nacl commercial grade standard methods 17 were used to analyze indicators such as nh4 n no2 n total nitrogen tn and volatile suspended solids vss 2 2 granular sludge inoculation the seed sludges of r1 r2 and r3 were inoculated from the laboratory anammox egsb reactor r0 which was operated at 0 g l nacl and a nitrogen volume load of 2 58 kg m3 d for one year after r1 r2 and r3 were inoculated with granular sludge they were all stably operated under the conditions of 0 g l nacl and a total nitrogen load nlr of 2 39 kg m3 d the average removal rates of nh4 n no2 n and tn were 91 4 0 8 98 0 0 7 and 88 5 1 5 respectively then r1 r2 and r3 were adjusted to maintain stable operation at salinities of 0 g l 15 g l and 30 g l nacl respectively during stable reactor operation most of the anammox granules were concentrated within approximately the bottom 10 cm of the egsb reactor fig s1 samples of anammox granules were taken from r1 r2 and r3 via a sampling port located 5 cm away from the bottom of the egsb reactor fig s1 thus the anammox granules samples collected from reactors were representative and comparable 2 3 surface characteristics of the anammox granules 2 3 1 particle size because anammox granules are relatively large the particle size was analyzed by an image analysis method that is used in the measurement of large particles the method details are as follows sludge samples were spread onto 9 cm diameter petri dishes photographs were taken with a digital camera and then nano measurer 1 2 software was used to determine and calibrate the anammox granule diameter 11 18 finally the obtained sludge samples were sieved through a 12 mesh sieve and used for subsequent eps extraction and surface characteristic analysis 2 3 2 aggregation index ai an ai was introduced to characterize the aggregation of anammox granules in this study via the method of hou et al 9 which involves measuring changes in turbidity the details are described in text s1 of the supplementary material 2 3 3 zeta potential and contact angle the zeta potential of anammox granules was measured according to the method reported by hou et al 9 the anammox granule samples were ground and homogenized into a sludge suspension which was dispersed in 10 ml of 0 1 m nacl a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer nano zs90 malvern uk was used to measure the zeta potential of the anammox granule samples at 25 c this test was repeated 10 times and the average was taken a contact angle measurement instrument dsa 100 kruss germany was used to measure the contact angles between the anammox granules and three liquids distilled water formamide and 1 bromonaphthalene the contact angle between anammox granules and distilled water was used to characterize the hydrophobicity of the granules the contact angles between the anammox granules and distilled water formamide and 1 bromonaphthalene were measured to calculate the surface tension and its different action items of anammox granules and then calculate the interface force and interface free energy of anammox granules the method followed that reported by liu et al 19 and each sample was measured 10 times to obtain the average 2 4 surface thermodynamics and xdlvo curve analysis based on the contact angles of the anammox granules obtained under three various salinity conditions a thermodynamic analysis method 20 could be used to obtain the surface thermodynamic calculation parameters including the hamaker constant a b l b the van der waals free energy δ g b l l w the lewis acid base hydration free energy δ g b l a b and the interface adsorption free energy δ g a d h by comparing these indicators the influence of salinity on the superficial characteristics of anammox granules could be further analyzed the measured zeta potential data combined with the above surface thermodynamic parameters were used to calculate the van der waals adsorption term w a static repulsion term w r and acid base hydration term w a b from the xdlvo theory 20 this method assumed that the bacterial cells were spheroids the detailed methodology and calculation steps are presented in texts s2 and s3 respectively of the supplementary material 2 5 eps extraction and measurement 2 5 1 extraction and contents determination of eps a cation exchange resin method 21 was used to extract eps from the anammox granules and the detailed method is described in text s4 of the supplementary material part of the eps extract was directly used to determine the contents of eps and for 3d eem test the other part was freeze dried at 35 c for one week prior to analysis by ftir spectroscopy studies of eps focus mostly on pn and ps which are the predominant constituents of eps 22 24 pn and ps represent 20 80 and 20 55 of the eps mass respectively and count for 70 80 of total organic carbon in eps 22 24 the surface charge hydrophobicity and spatial structure of the aggregates are mainly affected by the pn and ps in eps 25 the total amount of eps was calculated as the sum of the pn and ps contents the modified lowry colorimetric method was used to determine the pn content in eps 11 and the glucose based anthrone sulfate colorimetric method was used to determine the ps content in eps 9 the pn and ps contents were averaged over 5 parallel sample measurements 2 5 2 ftir and 3d eem spectral analyses eps powder 10 0 mg was mixed with ftir grade kbr in a mass ratio of 1 200 and then analyzed by ftir spectroscopy tensor 27 bruker germany all the ftir spectra were normalized after acquisition to a maximum emission of 1 0 the software peakfit 4 12 was used to analyze the amide i region of the infrared spectra to determine the secondary protein structures and relative protein content then according to the second derivative of the ftir bands various types of hydrogen bonds were identified after deconvolution of the broad peak at 3700 3000 cm 1 a gaussian fitting model was applied to the deconvoluted ftir peaks in origin 9 0 software the 3d eem spectra of eps were recorded with a fluorescence photometer f 7000 fl hitachi japan and the injection volume was 3 ml raman scattering of water was corrected using pure water as a blank during the measurement the excitation wavelength was scanned between 200 and 400 nm with a sampling interval of 5 nm and the emission spectrum was scanned between 220 and 500 nm in 5 nm increments with a scanning speed of 3000 nm min in order to more clearly reflect the 3d eem spectral characteristics of eps we have eliminated the rayleigh scattering from the 3d eem spectra of eps and have further optimized the data 3 results 3 1 reactor performance and granular sludge characteristics three anammox egsb reactors with different salinities were operated stably and sampled over the course of the study the average tn removal rates of r1 r2 and r3 were 88 0 0 7 87 8 0 4 and 87 1 0 6 respectively the reactors achieved good nitrogen removal under high salinity conditions indicating that the anammox granules were salt tolerant to some extent which was similar to the results of wang et al 3 during the stable operation of r1 r2 and r3 the ratio of ammonia nitrogen consumed to nitrite nitrogen consumed to nitrate nitrogen produced was 1 1 138 0 154 1 1 136 0 146 and 1 1 130 0 143 respectively these ratios were close to the value of 1 1 146 0 161 stoichiometry of the anammox reaction reported by lotti et al 26 revealing that high anammox activity led to tn removal at the three salinity levels in the anammox egsb reactors photographs of the anammox granules at the tested salinities are shown in fig s2 the appearance of the anammox granules was consistent most were ellipsoidal in shape with an uneven surface iron red color and dense structure as the salinity increased the color of the anammox bacteria darkened which was similar to the results of lu et al 15 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the average granule size was 2 85 0 20 mm 2 17 0 13 mm and 1 75 0 17 mm respectively the average granule size gradually decreased with increasing salt concentration 3 2 ai of anammox granules to investigate the influence of salinity on the aggregation capacity of anammox granules the aggregation degree of the granules at various salt concentrations was measured and the results are shown in fig 1 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the ai was 21 3 1 5 14 6 0 8 and 7 1 0 9 respectively it showed that the aggregation performance of anammox granules under salinity conditions was inhibited which is consistent with the change of particle size studies have reported that eps can change the surface chemical properties hydrophobicity and other physicochemical properties of granules 9 to reveal the mechanism behind the decrease in aggregation with increasing salinity the surface characteristics of anammox granules eps contents eps functional groups in anammox granules at various salinities were studied 3 3 zeta potential and contact angle the zeta potential of anammox granules at various salinities is shown in fig 2 at salinities of 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the zeta potential of anammox granules was 19 2 1 0 mv 22 5 1 2 mv and 23 6 1 8 mv respectively this shows that the surface of anammox granules is electronegative and that the electronegativity increases with increasing nacl salinity in addition the significant correlation between the ai and zeta potential p 0 01 table s1 indicates that an increase in electronegativity is not conducive to the aggregation of anammox granules the hydrophobicity of sludge can be expressed by the contact angle between sludge and distilled water and the hydrophobicity of the sludge surface is the driving force of granule aggregation 27 as shown in table 1 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the contact angles between anammox granules and distilled water were 85 56 0 67 73 82 0 13 and 70 30 1 24 respectively which indicates that the hydrophobicity of anammox granules decreases with increasing salinity in addition the significant correlation between ai and hydrophobicity p 0 01 table s1 indicates that the reduction in hydrophobicity is not conducive to the aggregation of anammox granules 3 4 analysis of the surface free energy of anammox granules based on the xdlvo curve the surface thermodynamic indexes of anammox granules at various salinities table 2 were calculated by substituting the zeta potential of the anammox granules and the contact angle between the anammox granules and distilled water formamide and 1 bromonaphthalene into the relevant formula given in the text s2 of the supplementary material the value of δ g a d h can characterize the interaction between microorganisms and water molecules 20 generally the interaction between water molecules has a δ g a d h value of 0 mj m2 a δ g a d h 0 indicates that the interaction between microorganisms and water molecules surpasses the interaction between water molecules microorganisms tend to bind with water thus showing a hydrophilic effect conversely when δ g a d h 0 the microorganisms exhibit a hydrophobic effect it can be seen from table 2 that the δ g a d h values of the anammox granules under the three salinities were all negative and as the salinity increased δ g a d h increased 66 18 2 04 mj m2 22 72 1 57 mj m2 and 19 32 1 11 mj m2 which indicated that the hydrophobic interaction of the anammox granules weakened as the salinity increased at the same salinity conditions the δ g b l a b of anammox granules were smaller than those of δ g b l l w δ g b l l w was a key factor for determining δ g a d h that is δ g b l a b played an important role in the aggregation process of anammox granules in addition with increasing salinity the δ g b l l w value and δ g b l a b value of the anammox granules gradually increased and the rate of increased in δ g b l a b was obviously larger than that in δ g b l l w to further study the aggregation mechanism under salinity conditions xdlvo theory was applied to analyze the relationship between various interaction energies and the separation distance h between the cells 9 the w a w r and w a b values of the anammox granules were calculated from the obtained thermodynamic index data and the w t equation for the anammox granules was obtained by adding these three terms fig 3 shows the xdlvo curves for the anammox granules under various salinities the aggregation characteristics of anammox granules are related to w t w a w r and w a b but various interaction energies are interdependent and significantly varied as shown in fig 3 the w t curves of anammox granules at all the tested salinities 0 15 and 30 g l nacl had potential energy barriers preventing mutual attraction between granules and the energy barrier increased with increasing salinity in this paper although the changes in the w a w r and w a b curves for the anammox granules were similar under the different salinity conditions notably the change in w a b was more obvious than that in w a and w r with an increase in salinity therefore w a b which determines the hydrophobic force played a key role in the aggregation of anammox granules at the tested salinities the w a b of anammox granules was negative and the w a b increased with increasing salinity indicating that the hydrophobic interactions among anammox granules weakened as the salinity increased thus salinity increases adversely impacted the aggregation of anammox granules which was consistent with the ai results fig 1 3 5 eps components and contents the adhesion and aggregation performance of microbial cells is closely related to eps 5 9 to further study the reasons for the decrease in sludge aggregation due to the surface characteristic changes as salinity increased the changes in the components and contents of eps in the reaction system were analyzed fig 4 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the pn content in eps was 90 45 2 11 mg g vss 76 90 1 70 mg g vss and 65 10 2 13 mg g vss the ps content was 10 26 0 16 mg g vss 12 31 0 09 mg g vss and 15 43 0 32 mg g vss the total eps content was 100 72 2 27 mg g vss 89 21 1 79 mg g vss 80 53 2 45 mg g vss and the pn ps ratio was 8 8 6 2 and 4 2 respectively these results indicated that salinity promoted the production of polysaccharides in anammox granules and inhibited the production of proteins thus changing the composition of eps fang et al 11 obtained similar results while researching the salinity influence on anammox granules 3 6 ftir spectra of eps although the above results indicated that the aggregation of anammox granules decreased as the salinity increased mainly as a result of changes in hydrophobic interactions the role of hydrophobicity in this mechanism needed to be further explored therefore ftir spectroscopy was used to observe the functional groups of anammox granule eps at different salinities and analyzed the changes an ftir spectrum of the anammox granule eps is shown in fig 5 the position and number of some eps functional groups changed with increasing salinity the hydrophobic c h groups in alkane organics and polysaccharides produced stretching vibrations near 2932 cm 1 28 and the ratio of the peak of anammox granules to 15 g l nacl or 30 g l nacl was less than that to 0 g l nacl the peak near 1635 cm 1 corresponded to the stretching vibration of co groups in proteins 9 and this peak was within the region corresponding to the β sheet secondary protein structure 29 β sheet structures promote aggregation in anammox sludge but the proportion of the peak at 1635 cm 1 decreased obviously with increasing salinity the peak near 1455 cm 1 indicated the presence of uronic acid 30 and the peak ratio of anammox granules at 30 g l nacl was higher than that at 0 g l nacl the peak near 1398 cm 1 was related to the bending vibration of hydrophobic ch2 groups 31 and the proportion of this peak decreased obviously with increasing salinity the peaks at approximately 1033 cm 1 were attributed to coh and co groups in polysaccharides 11 and this peak proportion increased obviously with increasing salinity it is also worth noting that the eps we extracted from anammox granules were mainly located at 3700 3000 cm 1 and the wide overlapping peaks in this area indicated the existence of hydrogen bonds within the eps 32 the higher the proportion of hydrogen bonds in the system is the stronger the interaction between molecules and the more viscous the system 33 34 fig 5 shows that the ratio of the peaks at approximately 3285 cm 1 decreased significantly with increasing salinity which indicated that the proportion of hydrogen bonds in the eps of anammox granules was reduced and the sludge did not easily agglomerate hydrogen bonds one of the main aggregation cohesion forces in eps have been reported to play an important role in promoting the aggregation of sludge and maintaining the structure of sludge 32 35 36 in the deconvoluted ftir spectra fig s3 the percentages of hydrogen bonds in the eps functional groups were 25 82 23 26 and 18 41 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl respectively the hydrogen bonds in the eps of anammox granules were divided into intermolecular hydrogen bonds molecular hydrogen bonds and free hydroxyl groups table s2 at 0 15 and 30 g l nacl the percentage of intermolecular hydrogen bonds to hydrogen bonds was 55 66 49 18 and 48 50 respectively the percentage of intermolecular hydrogen bonds decreases under salinity conditions which indicates that salinity is not conducive to the aggregation of anammox granules 35 36 the ftir spectroscopy results indicated the presence of uronic acid hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups in eps these groups are the main determinants of the electronegativity and hydrophilicity of eps 37 38 as the salinity increased the zeta potential and the number of hydrophilic functional groups increased while the number of hydrophobic functional groups decreased therefore sludge aggregation was inhibited the hydrophobicity of protein has an important influence on the surface hydrophobicity of granular sludge and the change of protein hydrophobicity can be well characterized by the analysis of protein secondary structure 9 the percentage of protein secondary structures in eps of anammox granules under various salinity conditions is shown in table s3 the ratio of α helix β sheet random coil ratio is often used to characterize secondary protein structures 9 39 a low ratio indicates a loose protein structure and easily exposed internal hydrophobic groups 9 as shown in table s3 the α helix β folding random coil ratio increased with increasing salinity this result indicated that the hydrophobic secondary protein structures in eps were affected by salinity in such a way that reduced the exposure of hydrophobic groups in eps and therefore the hydrophobicity of the eps adversely impacting the aggregation of the anammox granules 3 7 3d eem spectra of eps the boundaries of the fluorescent areas and the substances represented by each area in the 3d eem spectra are based on the research of chen et al 40 fig 6 shows that the eem spectra of eps at various salinities all contained four distinct peaks peak a was situated in region ii ex em 200 255 335 380 nm which corresponded to tryptophan protein substances peak b was situated in region i ex em 200 250 280 335 nm which corresponded to tyrosine protein substances peak c was situated in region v ex em 250 335 280 380 nm which corresponded to humic acid like substances and peak d was situated in region iv ex em 250 380 380 540 nm which corresponded to soluble microbial byproducts table 3 shows the eem spectral parameters of the eps of anammox granules at the three salinities as shown in table 3 with increasing salinity the emission wavelength of peak a blueshifted and the absorption wavelength redshifted and then blueshifted the emission wavelength of peak b was blueshifted and the absorption wavelength redshifted and then blueshifted the shifting of the maximum absorption peak wavelength of the absorption band for organic substances to longer wavelengths is called a redshift and the opposite shifting is called a blueshift 41 42 a redshift is generally due to an increase in carbonyl carboxyl hydroxyl and amine groups in the fluorophore 41 a blueshift is related to a decrease in the percentage of functional groups such as aromatic rings and conjugated bonds in the fluorophore 42 and the fragmentation of large organic particles into smaller fragments 43 the redshift and blueshift of the fluorescence peaks indicated that the increase in salinity altered the functional groups of microbial metabolites which further affected the sludge aggregation a fluorescence peak may be composed of superimposed signals from multiple groups and may contain multiple fluorescence peaks in the same fluorescence region but the fluorescence regional integration fri used by chen 40 can address possible overlaps in a spectrum the percentages of fri regions corresponding to eps in anammox granules at various salinities are shown in fig 7 φ1 n denotes the fluorescence region for tyrosine type proteins φ2 n denotes the fluorescence region for tryptophan type proteins φ3 n denotes the fluorescence region for fulvic acid φ4 n denotes the fluorescence region for lysoid like microorganism byproduct and φ5 n denotes the fluorescence region for humic substances fig 7 shows that the ratios of these eem fluorescence regions varied with salinity the ratios were ranked as φ4 n φ2 n φ1 n φ3 n φ5 n at 0 g l nacl and φ1 n φ4 n φ2 n φ3 n φ5 n at 15 g l and 30 g l nacl under the same salinity conditions the proportions of the eps fluorescence regions for the anammox granules were in the same order as the salinity increased the percentage of φ1 n species increased and the percentages of φ3 n and φ5 n species decreased 4 discussion aggregation mechanisms of granular sludge are very complex involving the influence of operating conditions and cooperation between bacteria aggregation is the result of a comprehensive effect of physicochemical interactions and biological interactions the physicochemical interactions include van der waals attraction electrostatic repulsion and hydrophobic interactions caused by the electric double layer outside the cell 44 biological interactions mainly refer to the production of eps communication and competition between cells etc the physicochemical interactions can be characterized by the xdlvo theory which is considered to be the basic theory of cell aggregation 44 although this theory can explain the stability of a colloidal solution well it ignores the influence of biological interactions on the surface properties of sludge during sludge aggregation biological interactions can be characterized by the theory of eps action because the most important biological interaction that causes cell aggregation is the production of eps therefore this article discusses the mechanism of anammox granuler aggregation from two perspectives xdlvo theory and eps action theory metal cations are widely regarded as important factors affecting sludge aggregation based on xdlvo theory the surface of sludge is generally negatively charged according to the xdlvo theory when two surfaces carry the same charges there is a free energy barrier between them that acts as a repulsive force the repulsive force formed between the sludge granules is the main factor hindering their aggregation 45 this repulsion is reported to be affected by metallic cations 45 the increase in ionic strength 0 to about 0 1 0 2 m will reduce the electrostatic repulsion by compressing the electric double layer thereby facilitating the adhesion and aggregation of sludge 45 46 however if the system exceeds this ionic strength range this will either enhance or reduce the sludge aggregation performance 45 the repulsion potential of anammox granules increased and the hydrophobic interaction decreased with increasing nacl salinity based on the xdlvo theory described in this paper this result is consistent with the reduction in granular sludge zeta potential and hydrophobicity this may be due to the exchange of na in wastewater with multivalent cations such as ca2 and mg2 in granular sludge 47 48 so that the thickness of the diffusion layer increases resulting in the double layer thickening increasing the sludge repulsion potential which hinders the aggregation of granular sludge the aggregation of granular sludge is closely related to the biological effects mediated by eps which involve bacteria embedding in gel material with cross linked eps as the matrix 48 eps covering the surface of sludge can change the surface properties of microbial aggregates such as the hydrophobicity and zeta potential thereby affecting the sludge aggregation it is reported that ps has negatively charged and hydrophilic functional groups such as hydroxyl carboxyl and phosphoric acid groups 25 49 while pn contains positively charged and hydrophobic amino acid functional groups such as alanine cysteine and valine 9 50 as the nacl salinity increases the reduction in pn ps may reduce the relative hydrophobicity and zeta potential of the sludge thereby hindering the aggregation of anammox granules in fact eps can effectively inhibit the interaction between hydrophilic groups and water molecules with the strong forces such as hydrogen bonds and improve the surface properties of granules by adhering and fixing hydrophobic substances 51 furthermore the ftir and 3d eem data showed that with increasing of nacl salinity the percentage of hydrophobic fulvic acid like substances and humic acid like substances in eps decreased while the percentages of more hydrophilic functional groups such as uronic acid hydroxyl groups and carbonyl groups increased therefore salinity affects the hydrophobicity and electronegativity of the sludge surface by changing the protein secondary structure hydrogen bonding system and functional groups content thereby reducing the aggregation performance of granular sludge these results are important for studying the influence of salinity on the aggregation of anammox granules based on bacterial surface characteristics and the eps composition and functional groups first microbial aggregates formed by anammox bacteria through aggregation are central to ensuring effective aggregation an elucidated mechanism can provide a theoretical basis for aggregation in anammox sludge and the retention of functional bacteria in the anammox facilitated treatment of high salinity wastewater second it is possible to create environmental conditions that are more conducive to the aggregation of anammox granules by regulating the conditions of the reactor influent accelerating the aggregation of anammox granules and shortening the granulation time thus improving the efficiency of sewage treatment in addition a hydrophobic material or carrier to which bacteria can adhere can be developed thereby promoting the application of anammox treatment related research is underway to improve the aggregation performance of anammox sludge and to achieve better granulation of anammox bacteria 5 conclusion the changes in surface characteristics eps components and eps functional groups of anammox granules at various nacl salinity conditions were studied to investigate the influence of nacl salinity on the aggregation of anammox granules as the salinity increased the diameter aggregation index zeta potential and hydrophobicity of anammox granules decreased the analyses of the surface free energy based on xdlvo theory showed that an increase in salinity resulted in reducing the hydrophobic interactions and increasing the repulsive barrier of anammox granules aggregation furthermore the production of polysaccharides was promoted but the protein was inhibited at various nacl salinity conditions consequently the components of eps changed besides more proofs for reduction in aggregation performance due to high salinity from ftir and 3d eem experiments suggested that the percentages of intermolecular hydrogen bonds the secondary structure of hydrophobic proteins and hydrophobic fluorescent products in eps among anammox granules decreased with increasing salinity author contribution the first and corresponding authors contributed to the idea planning

13697,this study identified plant rhizobacteria that have the capability to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and assist the plant in enhancing the phytoremediation process of pah contaminated wastewater rhizobacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere zone of lepironia articulata exposed to 1 2 and 3 diesel concentrations vdiesel vwater thirty colonies were isolated and after morphological and biochemical tests they were classified into 23 colonies these colonies were screened with a 3 diesel concentration vdiesel vwater and only nine rhizobacteria coded as a b c d e f g h and i were able to tolerate and sustain this the extensive biodegradation of pahs was carried out on the nine isolated rhizobacteria individually as a monoculture and it was found that the three rhizobacteria identified as pseudomonas toyotomiensis strain nd1 e microbacterium resistens strain nd2 g and bacillus pumilus train nd3 i were highly able to remove pahs 80 removal further biodegradation studies on the 16 components of pahs were conducted for mixed cultures e g i g e g i and e i and a mixed culture of g e was found to be the best group in degrading pahs 89 removal the existence of rhizobacteria either as a monoculture or mixed culture assisted the degradation of pahs thus enhancing the removal of pah from wastewater this study revealed the promising potential of the newly identified pah degraders as candidates in enhancing the phytoremediation efficiency of pah keywords rhizobacteria polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons biodegradation emergent plant phytotechnology 1 introduction pollution due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs has gained increasing attention worldwide due to the harm they cause to the environment pahs are aromatic hydrocarbons from benzene rings that are combined whether in a linear or clustered structure they are divided into light or heavy pahs light pahs comprise fewer than four benzene rings while heavy pahs are having more than three benzene rings 1 light pahs usually exist in the gaseous phase they are relatively water soluble whereas heavy pahs are usually associated with the particulate fraction and they are more stable and toxic than light ones and are the most carcinogenic 2 according to zhao et al 3 most of the 16 pahs are widespread and are categorized as priority organic contaminants in either soils water or wastewater these include both light pahs naphthalene acenaphthylene acenaphthene phenanthrene fluorene and anthracene and heavy pahs fluoranthene pyrene chrysene benz a anthracene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene dibenz a h anthracene dibenz a h anthracene and benzo g h i perylene the technologies available for the removal of pahs include physical chemical and biological methods such as chemical oxidation photo oxidation volatilization thermal decomposition bioaccumulation decomposition by indigenous and exogenous microorganisms and plants physicochemical treatment and adsorption 4 7 wastewater treatment facilities utilize vast amounts of energy and chemicals that are harmful to the environment 8 which needs to be accompanied by an additional treatment due to its chemical remnants 9 therefore it has been a driving force for the industry to develop more cost effective and friendly methods including biological treatment phytoremediation is one such biological treatment method an in situ remediation technology that uses the natural abilities of living plants to treat the contaminated medium it is a solar energy driven clean up technology that uses nature to cleanse nature which leads to an eco friendly technology 10 11 13 according to ji et al 14 a cost saving of 50 80 can be achieved when phytoremediation is applied compared to conventional technologies phytoremediation depends on the uptake capabilities of plant root systems which enable the translocation storage degradation and bioaccumulation of the contaminant 15 many research efforts have been directed towards the development of effective bioremediation processes through the application of different plants 16 18 the capabilities of plant root systems are governed by the relationship between the plants and microbial communities in the rhizosphere which has the advantages of being natural and releasing nothing into the environment 19 soil microorganisms such as rhizobacteria have a significant influence on the phytoremediation of hydrocarbons where the phytoremediation is presumed to be in accordance with the stimulation of the degrading root microbiome in the root area rhizodegradation this involves the process of breaking down organic pollutants by microbial action in the rhizosphere of the plants 20 al badawi et al 2017 hydrocarbon degradation depends on the activity of the bacteria in the rhizosphere rather than those within the plant due to the poor solubility of oil and hydrocarbons in water 21 according to penrose and glick 22 rhizodegradation was enhanced when high concentrations of bacteria were found in the rhizosphere zone and this can be attributed to the existence of high levels of nutrients that are excreted from the roots of most plants they consumed nutrients and multiplied to form a new cell 23 rhizodegradation has been studied and found to successfully remediate a broad range of organic chemicals such as petroleum hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs chlorinated solvents ethylbenzene benzene xylenes toluene and pesticides 20 24 26 however no study has yet been carried out using rhizobacteria isolated from l articulata to degrade pahs thus the objective of this study is to identify rhizobacteria from the rhizosphere of lepironia articulata that can degrade pahs contaminated with diesel where the isolation of rhizobacteria was done during a phytotoxicity study on l articulata 27 this study describes the characterization and grouping of isolated rhizobacteria colonies and the screening and selection of the rhizobacteria that are tolerant to diesel contamination through several levels of testing 2

in a rotary shaker at 37 c at 150 rpm for 18 24 h then the sample was centrifuged at 4000 rpm at 4 c for 10 min using an eppendorf centrifuge t type 5810 r usa and the supernatants were separated to prepare a standard inoculation from a pellet in a 250 ml conical flask the bacteria were grown with 50 ml of msm containing 10 standard inoculation rhizobacteria with 1 and 3 diesel concentration for screening and incubated at 37 c for five days on the fifth day the ability of the rhizobacteria to grow and survive in diesel was examined by the growth of the bacteria cfu ml on tsa using the ratings of good growth medium growth low growth and no growth 2 4 biodegradation test of selected rhizobacteria the biodegradation test used gas chromatography gc fid agilent technologies model 7890a gc system u s a to measure the ability of the selected rhizobacteria from the screening test to degrade pahs the pahs standard comprised 16 compounds which were naphthalene acenaphthylene acenaphthene

using centrifugation eppendorf centrifuge 5418 at 4000 rpm and 4 c for 10 min the pahs were extracted from the supernatant and analysed according to the water extraction for pahs procedure by al sbani et al 27 under subsection 2 6 the biodegradation of pahs in msm broth was done in two stages the first stage tested each bacterium alone monoculture to select the bacteria that can degrade pahs then these bacteria were tested in groups to select the best mixed culture for pah degradation subsequently 50 ml of msm containing a 3 diesel concentration 1 5 ml diesel and 10 v v bacterium inoculum for a mixed culture consisting of two rhizobacteria 2 5 ml of each bacterium was used for mixed culture of three rhizobacteria 1 67 ml of each bacterium was used was used with an optical density of 550 od550 the pah removal was determined by comparing the pah content on the fifth day with the initial pah 2 5 identification of selected rhizobacteria in this step the selected rhizobacteria that could remove and degrade pahs were identified using 16 s rrna the pure rhizobacteria were grown in tsb medium and incubated for 24 h at 37 c genomic dna was extracted from the rhizobacteria culture using the rtp bacteria dna mini kit after the genomic extraction the 16s rrna was amplified using ready to use polymerase chain reaction pcr master mix promega with the primer pair of universal primer 27 f

min purification of pcr products was done using the purelinktm quick pcr purification kit and the size and purity were determined through the agarose gel electrophoresis method using generuler 1 kb dna as the ladder marker an outsource company first base laboratories sdn bhd kuala lumpur malaysia was assigned to do the 16s rrna sequencing next sequence comparison with 21 bacterial 16s rrna was made through blast analysis available on the website of the national center for biotechnology information ncbi http blast ncbi nlm nih gov blast cgi multiple arrangements of 21 different 16s rrna gene sequences that were approximately similar to the strains were retrieved from the database and aligned using clustal w 35 the phylogenic trees of each 16s rrna sequence were constructed using the neighbour joining model in the software package mega 6 0 36 and bootstrapping was performed with 1000 replicates 2 6 statistical data analysis data were analysed statistically using spss version 16 spss inc u s a significant differences in the pahs removal were tested within the monoculture and mixed culture a significance level of p 0 05 was used for the paired samples t test 34 37 the samplings were triplicated and the results are presented as means standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolation and characterization of rhizobacteria as suggested by das and chandran 38 in their review article the microorganisms used for biodegradation need to be native to the contaminated area since they have higher tolerance and potential for hydrocarbon degradation about 30 different colonies of bacteria were isolated from the root zone of l articulata exposed to diesel concentrations of 1 2 3 and 5 vdiesel vwater 27 fig 1 summarises the results obtained from the biochemical tests of the colonies gram stain catalase oxidase and motility for the gram stain 63 3 of the l articulata rhizobacteria were positive and the rest were negative bacteria with gram positive has thicker peptidoglycan cell wall compared to gram negative bacteria which do not hold the blue dye used in the initial dying process due to the thinner peptidoglycan layer 39 in many studies the rodshaped strains are biochemically gram negative 40 in addition the isolated rhizobacteria were positive for the catalase 26 7 oxidase 30 and motility 23 3 tests bacteria with positive catalase test has the ability to produce catalase enzyme to convert hydrogen peroxide h2o2 produced during normal metabolism into water and oxygen 41 thus reducing the toxicity of this toxic compound bacteria with a positive oxidase test can donate or accept electrons from h2 electron acceptor in an aerobic respiratory mechanism which is composed of several enzymes that alternatively oxidize and reduce among them 42 a motility test was done to differentiate between motile and non motile bacteria bacteria with positive motility tests represent ones that can move by itself using flagella 43 according to rendueles and velicer 44 it is crucial for migration toward nutrient sources host colonization biofilm and fruiting body formation and predation after going through these biochemical tests the colony number was reduced to 23 isolates due to similarities in the characterizations 3 2 screening of rhizobacteria through diesel exposure based on the results of the bacteria growth on tsa on day 5 of the exposure to diesel nine out of the 23 isolated rhizobacteria had medium growth and good growth as shown in table 1 and these rhizobacteria were proceeded to the degradation test the 14 remaining bacteria showed low or no growth after exposure to diesel for five days 3 3 removal analysis of total pahs by selected rhizobacteria biodegradation is one decontamination method that can remove organic contaminants by natural biological activity in the substrate 45 46 in this test the nine bacteria coded as a b c d e f g h and i were exposed individually to a 3 diesel concentration in msm the samples were tested for pahs at zero and after five days and measured by gc fid the chromatograms after five days of exposure in control fig 2 a and in treatments with rhizobacteria coded as a until i fig 2 b j indicate the signal levels of pahs treatments with rhizobacteria displayed lower signal than the control the results indicate that all nine bacteria can degrade pahs upon diesel exposure fig 3 depicted the degradation percentages by all selected rhizobacteria where bacteria e g and i were having the best degradation percentages with values of 80 9 84 9 and 80 3 respectively while the removals by a b c d f and h were 52 1 58 1 48 8 48 5 46 and 53 6 respectively based on these findings e g and i as listed in table 2 were selected for the pah degradation study as monocultures and mixed cultures to determine which is the best to degrade pahs the images in this table represent the colour and shapes for the rhizobacteria selected based on their good growth in diesel exposure for the subsequent degradation studies it can be seen colony e has white colour as compared with g and i having yellowish rhizobacteria g has the smallest size compared to e and i and this colony has irregular shapes and rough surfaces 3 4 degradation of individual pah components by selected monoculture the degradation of the 16 components by each rhizobacterium after five days was measured by extracting the pahs on day zero and after five days of exposure the pah component degradation is different for each rhizobacterium because the enzymatic degradation of pah depends on both the structural and thermodynamic characteristics of the compounds 47 fig 4 a c shows the concentrations of the 16 components on day zero and the fifth day of exposure for bacteria e g and i respectively from the results the total removals of the pahs were 80 9 84 9 and 80 3 by bacteria e g and i respectively the bacteria are adept at utilizing pah components as a sole source of carbon and energy and the metabolic sequence and enzymatic reaction lead to the degradation of pahs 47 48 the products of the complete mineralization of the contaminant by the biodegradation process comprise co2 h2o and cell biomass 49 naphthalene can be entirely degraded by bacteria g and i and 98 8 by bacterium e according to hassanshahian and boroujeni 50 isolated strains of shewanella salegentibacter halomonas marinobacter oceanicola idiomarina and thalassospira have the potential to degrade half of the percentage of naphthalene in 10 days of incubation in a different study bacillus atrophaeus cn4 had successfully removed 69 of the initial concentration of naphthalene in the first 12 h of incubation 51 there are many bacteria containing enzymes that can be related to the conversion and degradation of this component 52 as an example when a highly enriched degrading co culture phen9 dominant bacteria was pseudomonas stutzeri at 91 7 relative abundance was developed by zhang et al 53 the ubie like enzyme had involved during the degradation of this toxic component naphthalene is extremely toxic to humans and animals because it binds covalently to molecules in the tissues of the liver kidney and lungs in addition it also has the toxic potential in the inhabitation of mitochondrial respiration 54 furthermore according to mastrangelo et al 55 workers who were exposed to this organic compound had dermal and ophthalmological changes causing acute naphthalene poisoning resulting in haemolytic anaemia and nephrotoxicity acenaphthene and fluorene were also completely degraded by rhizobacteria e and g whereas rhizobacterium i presented degradation efficiencies for acenaphthene and fluorene of up to 99 and 88 6 some studies have reported the degradation of acenaphthene and fluorene by bacterial species such as mycobacterium brevibacterium and pseudomonas 52 56 sphingomonas sp strain a4 can use this organic compound as a sole carbon and energy source but it was unable to grow on other pahs 57 light pahs such as naphthalene acenaphthene and fluorene are more soluble and readily degraded by bacteria than those are heavy pahs both in the soil and under laboratory conditions 58 besides the existence of a bay region and a k region which are extremely reactive chemically and biologically which can be formed metabolically also contribute to the degradation of these compounds 59 acenaphthene is highly carcinogenic genotoxic and cytotoxic 60 for heavy pahs the best degradation of fluoranthene was achieved by rhizobacterium g up to 98 9 in a microcosm study conducted by song et al 61 acidobacteria was reported to be the putative degraders for this component as compared to anthracene and phenanthrene rhizobacteria g and i had the ability to degrade dibenz a h anthracene completely after five days compared to 36 7 by rhizobacterium e these bacteria might facilitate aerobic degradation of pahs via oxygenase enzymes which include dioxygenases majorly than monooxygenases 62 all of the rhizobacteria had degraded indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene to 100 at the end of 5 days the ability of these bacteria in degrading this component is a success since there are no other studies reported about this matter by using spss statistics 21 and based on a paired samples t test analysis p 0 05 the pah degradations by all three rhizobacteria e g and i were significant p 0 05 further degradation studies were carried out for the mixed culture since it has been noticed that different species of bacteria plays a different role in degrading different components in pahs 3 5 pah degradation by mixed culture the rhizobacteria were mixed to observe whether doing so can achieve a higher degradation than the monocultures they were mixed as e i g g e g i and e i and used to degrade pahs the concentrations of the pahs were again measured at day zero and after five days to compare the results with the monoculture fig 5 represents the gc chromatograms of pahs components for the mixed culture of e i g fig 5 a g e fig 5 b g i fig 5 c and e i fig 5 d first these were compared with chromatograms in control fig 2 a it can be seen that all of the rhizobacteria mixed cultures had the ability to degrade all components to a different extent as a comparison the mixed culture of g e was the best group with the lowest peak level among other mixed cultures with degradation ability up to 89 1 this mixed culture can degrade pahs better than the monoculture of rhizobacterium g 84 9 only previous research conducted by isaac et al 2015 supported these findings at which naphthalene and phenanthrene were completely degraded by mixed culture while pyrene degradation was enhanced by two fold by mixed culture the other combination of mixed culture of e i g had the lowest degradation potential 65 6 followed by g i 80 9 and e i 82 1 fig 6 a d represents the concentrations of 16 components on day zero and the fifth day of exposure for mixed cultures of e i g g e g i and e i respectively the mixed cultures of e i g and e i could degrade naphthalene and acenaphthylene completely after day 5 whereas the mixed cultures of g e and g i could degrade only naphthalene to 100 g e can degrade fluoranthene to 100 but e i g g i and e i degraded the pahs by only 22 5 20 and 38 8 respectively degradation of fluoranthene was 100 when bacteria g and e combined rather than when monoculture of g 98 9 or e 30 28 each bacterium uses a different pathway to degrade the pah components 63 thus making each one suitable for the treatment of specific components where some are able to secrete degradative enzymes whereas others may produce biosurfactants which help in better utilization by microbes due to the enhanced solubilization of hydrophobic hydrocarbons 64 the consortium of rhizobacteria mimic the nature of their live in the environment and allow the occurrence of the symbiotic mechanism to achieve higher removal efficiency 65 66 a further grasp of the microorganism arbitrated mechanisms of the catalysis of pahs will assist the evolution of novel approaches to reinforce the bioremediation of pah contaminated medium 52 statistical analysis based on a paired samples t test analysis indicated that the pah degradation of all mixed bacterial cultures was significant p 0 05 3 6 identification of selected rhizobacteria the 16s rrna gene sequences of the amplified pcr products were determined for each isolate e g and i and a phylogenetic tree was constructed to understand the phylogenetic relationship among the species fig 7 the phylogenetic tree showed that the sequence of 16 s rrna for isolate e gram negative g gram negative and i gram positive related more to pseudomonas toyotomiensis strain cys p3 microbacterium resistens strain bc 05407 and bacillus pumilus strain ip14 respectively with a substantial bootstrap value 100 no detailed molecular and biochemical analysis is needed to identify the rhizobacterium species since the bootstrap values are above 75 67 thus bacteria e g and i are assigned tentatively as pseudomonas toyotomiensis strain nd1 microbacterium resistens strain nd2 and bacillus pumilus strain nd3 several microorganisms predominantly from the genera of pseudomonas and mycobacterium were identified to be able to transform and degrade pahs under aerobic environments 56 additionally according to peng et al 52 pyrene was mineralized by numerous mycobacterium sp strains and utilized it as their sole carbon and energy sources 52 the majority of the pah degrading mycobacteria are fast growing species 68 furthermore the aerobic bacterium bacillus thermoleovorans can grow on naphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy 63 4 conclusions a biodegradation study was performed to study the potential of pah degrading rhizobacteria isolated from the roots of l articulata to enhance the phytoremediation of diesel contaminated wastewater the findings have proven that the mixed cultures degraded long chain hydrocarbons into shorter chains more than the monocultures the consortium of microbacterium resistens strain nd2 coded as g and bacillus pumilus strain nd3 coded as i was the best group and superior to any monoculture rhizobacteria in degrading pahs at up to 89 1 phytoremediation of pahs was significantly better with l articulata and it is expected to be further enhanced with the addition of mixed cultures with the chemicals released by rhizobacteria allowing shorter chains of hydrocarbons to be adsorbed and accumulate in the upper part of the plants therefore the results gained from this study will be the basis for future study where microbacterium resistens strain nd2 and bacillus pumilus strain nd3 will be added into a pilot constructed wetlands planted with l articulata in optimized conditions this type of remediation is a green and sustainable alternative for enhancing the degradation of pahs requiring no toxic product post treatment declaration of

13697,this study identified plant rhizobacteria that have the capability to degrade polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and assist the plant in enhancing the phytoremediation process of pah contaminated wastewater rhizobacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere zone of lepironia articulata exposed to 1 2 and 3 diesel concentrations vdiesel vwater thirty colonies were isolated and after morphological and biochemical tests they were classified into 23 colonies these colonies were screened with a 3 diesel concentration vdiesel vwater and only nine rhizobacteria coded as a b c d e f g h and i were able to tolerate and sustain this the extensive biodegradation of pahs was carried out on the nine isolated rhizobacteria individually as a monoculture and it was found that the three rhizobacteria identified as pseudomonas toyotomiensis strain nd1 e microbacterium resistens strain nd2 g and bacillus pumilus train nd3 i were highly able to remove pahs 80 removal further biodegradation studies on the 16 components of pahs were conducted for mixed cultures e g i g e g i and e i and a mixed culture of g e was found to be the best group in degrading pahs 89 removal the existence of rhizobacteria either as a monoculture or mixed culture assisted the degradation of pahs thus enhancing the removal of pah from wastewater this study revealed the promising potential of the newly identified pah degraders as candidates in enhancing the phytoremediation efficiency of pah keywords rhizobacteria polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons biodegradation emergent plant phytotechnology 1 introduction pollution due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs has gained increasing attention worldwide due to the harm they cause to the environment pahs are aromatic hydrocarbons from benzene rings that are combined whether in a linear or clustered structure they are divided into light or heavy pahs light pahs comprise fewer than four benzene rings while heavy pahs are having more than three benzene rings 1 light pahs usually exist in the gaseous phase they are relatively water soluble whereas heavy pahs are usually associated with the particulate fraction and they are more stable and toxic than light ones and are the most carcinogenic 2 according to zhao et al 3 most of the 16 pahs are widespread and are categorized as priority organic contaminants in either soils water or wastewater these include both light pahs naphthalene acenaphthylene acenaphthene phenanthrene fluorene and anthracene and heavy pahs fluoranthene pyrene chrysene benz a anthracene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene benzo a pyrene indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene dibenz a h anthracene dibenz a h anthracene and benzo g h i perylene the technologies available for the removal of pahs include physical chemical and biological methods such as chemical oxidation photo oxidation volatilization thermal decomposition bioaccumulation decomposition by indigenous and exogenous microorganisms and plants physicochemical treatment and adsorption 4 7 wastewater treatment facilities utilize vast amounts of energy and chemicals that are harmful to the environment 8 which needs to be accompanied by an additional treatment due to its chemical remnants 9 therefore it has been a driving force for the industry to develop more cost effective and friendly methods including biological treatment phytoremediation is one such biological treatment method an in situ remediation technology that uses the natural abilities of living plants to treat the contaminated medium it is a solar energy driven clean up technology that uses nature to cleanse nature which leads to an eco friendly technology 10 11 13 according to ji et al 14 a cost saving of 50 80 can be achieved when phytoremediation is applied compared to conventional technologies phytoremediation depends on the uptake capabilities of plant root systems which enable the translocation storage degradation and bioaccumulation of the contaminant 15 many research efforts have been directed towards the development of effective bioremediation processes through the application of different plants 16 18 the capabilities of plant root systems are governed by the relationship between the plants and microbial communities in the rhizosphere which has the advantages of being natural and releasing nothing into the environment 19 soil microorganisms such as rhizobacteria have a significant influence on the phytoremediation of hydrocarbons where the phytoremediation is presumed to be in accordance with the stimulation of the degrading root microbiome in the root area rhizodegradation this involves the process of breaking down organic pollutants by microbial action in the rhizosphere of the plants 20 al badawi et al 2017 hydrocarbon degradation depends on the activity of the bacteria in the rhizosphere rather than those within the plant due to the poor solubility of oil and hydrocarbons in water 21 according to penrose and glick 22 rhizodegradation was enhanced when high concentrations of bacteria were found in the rhizosphere zone and this can be attributed to the existence of high levels of nutrients that are excreted from the roots of most plants they consumed nutrients and multiplied to form a new cell 23 rhizodegradation has been studied and found to successfully remediate a broad range of organic chemicals such as petroleum hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs chlorinated solvents ethylbenzene benzene xylenes toluene and pesticides 20

number was reduced to 23 isolates due to similarities in the characterizations 3 2 screening of rhizobacteria through diesel exposure based on the results of the bacteria growth on tsa on day 5 of the exposure to diesel nine out of the 23 isolated rhizobacteria had medium growth and good growth as shown in table 1 and these rhizobacteria were proceeded to the degradation test the 14 remaining bacteria showed low or no growth after exposure to diesel for five days 3 3 removal analysis of total pahs by selected rhizobacteria biodegradation is one decontamination method that can remove organic contaminants by natural biological activity in the substrate 45 46 in this test the nine bacteria coded as a b c d e f g h and i were exposed individually to a 3 diesel concentration in msm the samples were tested for pahs at zero and after five days and measured by gc fid the chromatograms after five days of exposure in control fig 2 a and in treatments with rhizobacteria coded as a until i fig 2 b j indicate the signal levels of pahs treatments with rhizobacteria displayed lower signal than the control the results indicate that all nine bacteria can degrade pahs upon diesel exposure fig 3 depicted the degradation percentages by all selected rhizobacteria where bacteria e g and i were having the best degradation percentages with values of 80 9 84 9 and 80 3 respectively while the removals by a b c d f and h were 52 1 58 1 48 8 48 5 46 and 53 6 respectively based on these findings e g and i as listed in table 2 were selected for the pah degradation study as monocultures and mixed cultures to determine which is the best to degrade pahs the images in this table represent the colour and shapes for the rhizobacteria selected based on their good growth in diesel exposure for the subsequent degradation studies it can be seen colony e has white colour as compared with g and i having yellowish rhizobacteria g has the smallest size compared to e and i and this colony has irregular shapes and rough surfaces 3 4 degradation of individual pah components by selected monoculture the degradation of the 16 components by each rhizobacterium after five days was measured by extracting the pahs on day zero and after five days of exposure the pah component degradation is different for each rhizobacterium because the enzymatic degradation of pah depends on both the structural and thermodynamic characteristics of the compounds 47 fig 4 a c shows the concentrations of the 16 components on day zero and the fifth day of exposure for bacteria e g and i respectively from the results the total removals of the pahs were 80 9 84 9 and 80 3 by bacteria e g and i respectively the bacteria are adept at utilizing pah components as a sole source of carbon and energy and the metabolic sequence and enzymatic reaction lead to the degradation of pahs 47 48 the products of the complete mineralization of the contaminant by the biodegradation process comprise co2 h2o and cell biomass 49 naphthalene can be entirely degraded by bacteria g and i and 98 8 by bacterium e according to hassanshahian and boroujeni 50 isolated strains of shewanella salegentibacter halomonas marinobacter oceanicola idiomarina and thalassospira have the potential to degrade half of the percentage of naphthalene in 10 days of incubation in a different study bacillus atrophaeus cn4 had successfully removed 69 of the initial concentration of naphthalene in the first 12 h of incubation 51 there are many bacteria containing enzymes that can be related to the conversion and degradation of this component 52 as an example when a highly enriched degrading co culture phen9 dominant bacteria was pseudomonas stutzeri at 91 7 relative abundance was developed by zhang et al 53 the ubie like enzyme had involved during the degradation of this toxic component naphthalene is extremely toxic to humans and animals because it binds covalently to molecules in the tissues of the liver kidney and lungs in addition it also has the toxic potential in the inhabitation of mitochondrial respiration 54 furthermore according to mastrangelo et al 55 workers who were exposed to this organic compound had dermal and ophthalmological changes causing acute naphthalene poisoning resulting in haemolytic anaemia and nephrotoxicity acenaphthene and fluorene were also completely degraded by rhizobacteria e and g whereas rhizobacterium i presented degradation efficiencies for acenaphthene and fluorene of up to 99 and 88 6 some studies have reported the degradation of acenaphthene and fluorene by bacterial species such as mycobacterium brevibacterium and pseudomonas 52 56 sphingomonas sp strain a4 can use this organic compound as a sole carbon and energy source but it was unable to grow on other pahs 57 light pahs such as naphthalene acenaphthene and fluorene are more soluble and readily degraded by bacteria than those are heavy pahs both in the soil and under laboratory conditions 58 besides the existence of a bay region and a k region which are extremely reactive chemically and biologically which can be formed metabolically also contribute to the degradation of these compounds 59 acenaphthene is highly carcinogenic genotoxic and cytotoxic 60 for heavy pahs the best degradation of fluoranthene was achieved by rhizobacterium g up to 98 9 in a microcosm study conducted by song et al 61 acidobacteria was reported to be the putative degraders for this component as compared to anthracene and phenanthrene rhizobacteria g and i had the ability to degrade dibenz a h anthracene completely after five days compared to 36 7 by rhizobacterium e these bacteria might facilitate aerobic degradation of pahs via oxygenase enzymes which include dioxygenases majorly than monooxygenases 62 all of the rhizobacteria had degraded indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene to 100 at the end of 5 days the ability of these bacteria in degrading this component is a success since there are no other studies reported about this matter by using spss statistics 21 and based on a paired samples t test analysis p 0 05 the pah degradations by all three rhizobacteria e g and i were significant p 0 05 further degradation studies were carried out for the mixed culture since it has been noticed that different species of bacteria plays a different role in degrading different components in pahs 3 5 pah degradation by mixed culture the rhizobacteria were mixed to observe whether doing so can achieve a higher degradation than the monocultures they were mixed as e i g g e g i and e i and used to degrade pahs the concentrations of the pahs were again measured at day zero and after five days to compare the results with the monoculture fig 5 represents the gc chromatograms of pahs components for the mixed culture of e i g fig 5 a g e fig 5 b g i fig 5 c and e i fig 5 d first these were compared with chromatograms in control fig 2 a it can be seen that all of the rhizobacteria mixed cultures had the ability to degrade all components to a different extent as a comparison the mixed culture of g e was the best group with the lowest peak level among other mixed cultures with degradation ability up to 89 1 this mixed culture can degrade pahs better than the monoculture of rhizobacterium g 84 9 only previous research conducted by isaac et al 2015 supported these findings at which naphthalene and phenanthrene were completely degraded by mixed culture while pyrene degradation was enhanced by two fold by mixed culture the other combination of mixed culture of e i g had the lowest degradation potential 65 6 followed by g i 80 9 and e i 82 1 fig 6 a d represents the concentrations of 16 components on day zero and the fifth day of exposure for mixed cultures of e i g g e g i and e i respectively the mixed cultures of e i g and e i could degrade naphthalene and acenaphthylene completely after day 5 whereas the mixed cultures of g e and g i could degrade only naphthalene to 100 g e can degrade fluoranthene to 100 but e i g g i and e i degraded the pahs by only 22 5 20 and 38 8 respectively degradation of fluoranthene was 100 when bacteria g and e combined rather than when monoculture of g 98 9 or e 30 28 each bacterium uses a different pathway to degrade the pah components 63 thus making each one suitable for the treatment of specific components where some are able to secrete degradative enzymes whereas others may produce biosurfactants which help in better utilization by microbes due to the enhanced solubilization of hydrophobic hydrocarbons 64 the consortium of rhizobacteria mimic the nature of their live in the environment and allow the occurrence of the symbiotic mechanism to achieve higher removal efficiency 65 66 a further grasp of the microorganism arbitrated mechanisms of the catalysis of pahs will assist the evolution of novel approaches to reinforce the bioremediation of pah contaminated medium 52 statistical analysis based on a paired samples t test analysis indicated that the pah degradation of all mixed bacterial cultures was significant p 0 05 3 6 identification of selected rhizobacteria the 16s rrna gene sequences of the amplified pcr products were determined for each isolate e g and i and a phylogenetic tree was constructed to understand the phylogenetic relationship among the species fig 7 the phylogenetic tree showed that the sequence of 16 s rrna for isolate e gram negative g gram negative and i gram positive related more to pseudomonas toyotomiensis strain cys p3 microbacterium resistens strain bc 05407 and bacillus pumilus strain ip14 respectively with a substantial bootstrap value 100 no detailed molecular and biochemical analysis is needed to identify the rhizobacterium species since the bootstrap values are above 75 67 thus bacteria e g and i are assigned tentatively as pseudomonas toyotomiensis strain nd1 microbacterium resistens strain nd2 and bacillus pumilus strain nd3 several microorganisms predominantly from the genera of pseudomonas and mycobacterium were identified to be able to transform and degrade pahs under aerobic environments 56 additionally according to peng et al 52 pyrene was mineralized by numerous mycobacterium sp strains and utilized it as their sole carbon and energy sources 52 the majority of the pah degrading mycobacteria are fast growing species 68 furthermore the aerobic bacterium bacillus thermoleovorans can grow on naphthalene as the sole source of carbon and energy 63 4 conclusions a biodegradation study was performed to study the potential of pah degrading rhizobacteria isolated from the roots of l articulata to enhance the phytoremediation of diesel contaminated wastewater the findings have proven that the mixed cultures degraded long chain hydrocarbons into shorter chains more than the monocultures the consortium of microbacterium resistens strain nd2 coded as g and bacillus pumilus strain nd3 coded as i was the best group and superior to any monoculture rhizobacteria in degrading pahs at up to 89 1 phytoremediation of pahs was significantly better with l articulata and it is expected to be further enhanced with the addition of mixed cultures with the chemicals released by rhizobacteria allowing shorter chains of hydrocarbons to be adsorbed and accumulate in the upper part of the plants therefore the results gained from this study will be the basis for future study where microbacterium resistens strain nd2 and bacillus pumilus strain nd3 will be added into a pilot constructed wetlands planted with l articulata in optimized conditions this type of remediation is a green and sustainable alternative for enhancing the degradation of pahs requiring no toxic product post treatment declaration of

13698,lake recovery from acidification and climatic drivers are causing increasing concentrations of natural organic matter nom in surface waters across north american and europe these shifts in source water quality have caused challenges in the drinking water treatment industry particularly in direct filtration plants which are sensitive to changes in influent water quality there is a need for immediate treatment strategies to address the increasing organic load while sustainable solutions are developed the presented research investigated the impacts of partially substituting aluminum sulphate alum with a high charge density cationic polyelectrolyte on nom removal and unit filter run volume ufrv in a direct filtration pilot plant various combinations of alum 10 12 mg l and polyelectrolyte 0 1 mg l were compared to the current full scale plant dose of 12 mg l of alum the impacts of increasing the effective size of the filter media from 0 9 mm to 1 3 mm on nom removal and ufrv were also studied the partial substitution of alum with polyelectrolyte did not significantly impact total organic carbon toc removal which was consistent around 35 40 or toc residual concentrations which were approximately 2 1 2 3 mg l the ufrv was not impacted by the partial substitution of alum with polyelectrolyte but increasing the effective size did improve the ufrv by 3 to 16 m3 m2 without impacting the effluent water quality additionally the research highlighted the importance of understanding projected trends in the concentration and character of source water nom for sustainable drinking water treatment design keywords natural organic matter direct filtration recovery from acidification coagulation cationic polyelectrolyte 1 introduction over the last few decades increasing concentrations of natural organic matter nom measured as dissolved organic carbon doc have been recorded in lakes across many regions in northern america and europe 1 3 this trend has often been associated with recovery from acidification a phenomenon defined as increasing acid neutralization capacity alkalinity or ph in response to reduced atmospheric acid deposition 4 5 the concentration and character of nom in surface waters are also impacted by climatic factors including extreme weather events e g heavy precipitation droughts and warming temperatures which often lead to increased seasonal fluctuation in surface water quality 6 10 increasing concentration of doc in water supplies has multiple design implications in the drinking water treatment industry as the primary precursor for disinfection by products dbps a higher concentration of organic material in the supply can result in higher concentrations of dbps in the treated water drinking water treatment plants have also reported concomitant increases in chemical dosing e g coagulants ph controlling chemicals disinfectants in response to the positive trend in source water doc concentrations 11 13 the efficacy of nom removal in treatment with aluminum sulphate alum depends on the nature of the nom in the source water and the concentration and character of the hydrolysis species formed from the alum however increased alum doses due to higher doc concentrations will result in greater concentrations of metal hydroxide precipitates and larger volumes of sludge produced in the treatment process in direct filtration treatment plants this can lead to shorter filter runs more frequent backwashing and reduced water production for this reason direct filtration plants are often designed for low turbidity low organic content source waters and thus are particularly vulnerable to changes in source water quality such as increasing concentration of doc 14 the partial substitution of alum with a high charge density cationic polyelectrolyte is a common practice in direct filtration as it offers the benefit of charge neutralization capacity without additional solid loading from a precipitating coagulant such as alum 15 17 consequently unit filter run volumes ufrv can be increased as a result of reduced production of sludge from lowered alum doses 18 20 the combination of high charge density cationic polyelectrolyte with alum has been successful in pilot and full scaled direct filtration plants where reduced effluent turbidity 20 increased removal of ultraviolet adsorbing material at 254 nm uv254 15 and extend filter runs 16 21 have been achieved another strategy used to extend filter cycles is to increase the effective size es of the filter media coarser media allows for deeper penetration of incoming particulates into the filter bed resulting in an extension of solids retention over larger depths of the filter bed and in turn reduced rates of head loss development 22 nearly all the direct filtration plants in north america were built prior to the 1990s 14 21 before noticeable shifts in source water quality 2 5 23 some of these plants were designed based on acidified water quality conditions and due to more recent shifts in source water quality are currently operating near or outside their design guidelines 11 24 given that treatment plant upgrades can span over a period of years there is a need for immediate strategies to account for the changing source water quality while more significant and sustainable upgrades are researched designed and constructed however there exists a gap in the literature pertaining to adaptive strategies for utilities facing these changes instead the majority of literature surrounding this topic is focused on the phenomenon and mechanisms of change in source water quality caused by lake recovery from acidification or climatic factors the presented work addresses the identified gap by investigating strategies to improve the efficacy and efficiency of direct filtration treatment plants facing the stress of increasing concentrations of doc first the efficacy of nom and dbp precursor material removal was assessed by studying combinations of cationic polyelectrolyte and alum in coagulation these coagulant dosing combinations were also evaluated for treatment efficiency based on water production second the impact of increasing the es of filter media and extending the filter bed depth on the effluent water quality and ufrv were determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 j d kline water supply plant and pockwock lake the j d kline water supply plant jdkwsp is a direct filtration drinking water treatment plant in the halifax regional municipality of nova scotia canada and consists of pre screening oxidation pre chlorination coagulation flocculation dual media filtration and chlorination it is operated by halifax water at an average flow of 85 megalitres per day mld the source water for the jdkwsp is pockwock lake a low turbidity 1 ntu low alkalinity 5 mg l as caco3 lake which drains a protected watershed raw water characteristics for the period of study based on weekly analysis are presented in table 1 the water quality of pockwock lake is approaching the upper thresholds of some design guidelines for direct filtration plants valade et al 14 recommended that water drawn for treatment with direct filtration have an average annual total organic carbon toc concentration less than 3 mg l a value that pockwock lake has surpassed since the jdkwsp was commissioned in 1977 11 consequently the alum dose recently increased from 8 to 12 mg l although this is within the range of maximum alum doses recommended for direct filtration plants 10 15 mg l 25 27 it leaves little room for adjustment in response to further fluctuations in source water quality additional treatment challenges at the jdkwsp include reduced filter run times and increased formation of dbps 2 2 jdkwsp pilot plant the jdkwsp is equipped with a research pilot plant intuitech inc fig 1 comprised of two identical and parallel direct filtration treatment trains that simulate the full scale plant treatment process 28 for the duration of the study one of the trains was continuously operated under baseline conditions that were equivalent to the chemical dosing applied at the full scale plant this dosing was consistent at 12 mg l of alum the second train was used to investigate the alternative coagulation conditions pockwock lake water was supplied to the pilot plant at an average flow rate of 10 l min in the pre mix tanks potassium permanganate kmno4 was added for the oxidation of iron and manganese and sodium hypochlorite naocl was applied for pre chlorination lime ca oh 2 and carbon dioxide co2 were used to maintain a coagulation ph of 5 8 alum and cationic polyelectrolyte were added simultaneously in the final stage of pre mixing which was followed by three stage tapered flocculation 30 20 and 10 s 1 the flocculated water was then pumped to the filtration skid each filtration skid consisted of three 200 mm dual media anthracite and sand filter columns through which the flow was evenly distributed at a constant loading rate of 4 5 m hr the first filter column f fsp or the baseline simulated the full scale plant filtration bed design and was comprised of 61 cm of anthracite es of 0 9 mm and 30 5 cm of silica sand the second filter media layout f es0 9 had 91 5 cm of anthracite es 0 9 mm and 30 5 cm of sand the third filter column f es1 3 had 91 5 cm of anthracite es 1 3 mm and 30 5 cm of sand filter runs were terminated when the effluent turbidity exceeded 0 2 ntu the head loss across the filter was greater than 2 15 m or the filter run exceeded 80 h the pilot plant was not equipped for additional treatment after filtration 2 3 chemical reagents the primary coagulant used was liquid aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 14h2o chemtrade and the cationic polyelectrolyte was floquant fl 2449 snf canada fl 2449 is a high charge density linear polyamine with approximately 50 active content it was selected due to its high charge density and low viscosity as compared to other cationic polyelectrolytes 2 4 experimental procedures the use of cationic polyelectrolyte in conjunction with alum was investigated by comparing alum doses of 10 and 12 mg l with polyelectrolyte doses of 0 5 and 1 mg l to baseline conditions of 12 mg l of alum with no polyelectrolyte each trial consisted of one complete filter run through each of the three filter columns filter runs were terminated due to turbidity breakthrough 0 2 ntu terminal head loss 2 15 m or after 80 h two trials were completed for each alternative dosing condition equating to a total of six data points per dosing condition when all three columns were considered the coagulation ph was consistent at 5 8 throughout the entire study grab samples were collected simultaneously from the pilot plant raw flow and from each filter effluent once the effluent water quality had reached an equilibrium typically after 24 h the samples were analyzed for toc doc uv254 and disinfection by product formation potential dbpfp flocculated water samples were also collected for analysis of zeta potential filter hydraulic performance was evaluated based on the ufrv and turbidity and head loss profiles the filter hydraulic performance of f fsp and f es1 3 were compared under identical chemical dosing described previously to determine the impact of increasing the es of the filter media and extending the depth of the filter effluent toc ufrv and head loss and turbidity profiles were used as response parameters the aforementioned experiments were conducted from april 2019 to july 2019 therefore the results have limited seasonal variation 2 5 analytical procedures when applicable laboratory analysis and procedures were completed in accordance with standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 29 toc and doc samples were prepared following standard methods 5310 and measured with a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph uv254 was measured on a hach dr5000 uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 254 nm and used for calculation of specific uv absorbance suva samples were prepped for dbpfp namely trihalomethane formation potential thmfp and haloacetic acid formation potential haafp following a modified version of standard methods 5710 the samples were buffered to a ph of 8 and chlorine was dosed such that the free chlorine residual was 1 0 0 4 mg l after a 24 h incubation period the concentrations of haas and thms in the incubated samples were measured using gas chromatography with electron capture us environmental protection agency methods 552 2 and 551 1 respectively zeta potential was measured on a malvern panalytical zetasizer nano zs in line water quality parameters temperature ph turbidity were measured at critical points throughout the pilot plant treatment process and filter hydraulic performance was evaluated with continuous head loss and flow monitoring across each filter bed 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted with r 30 31 paired t tests were used to compare the response of alternative coagulation conditions to baseline conditions analysis of variance anova was used to determine if the filter media layouts produced equivalent effluent water quality kendall s tau correlations were applied to understand relationships between treated water quality parameters tests for normality were conducted with the shapiro wilks test and the level of significance for all statistical tests was 0 05 3 results 3 1 combined use of cationic polyelectrolyte and alum as the majority of toc in both the raw 102 4 6 and treated 99 8 water was in the dissolved form toc measurements were used to represent nom in the presented analysis in comparing residual toc concentrations fig a 1 and toc removal fig a 2 for the three filter media layouts with anova the effluent water quality was equivalent and thus results from the three media layouts were summarized fig 2 toc removal ranged from 31 to 44 for all four dosing combinations shown in fig 2 at a constant alum dose of 12 mg l there was no statistically significant difference in the means of residual toc when 0 5 mg l of polyelectrolyte was added compared to when it was not p 0 24 likewise toc removal was consistent 38 at an alum dose of 12 mg l with or without the addition of polyelectrolyte p 0 59 when alum was partially substituted with polyelectrolyte i e comparing 12 mg l of alum to 10 mg l of alum with 0 5 and 1 mg l of polyelectrolyte there was again no significant improvement or reduction in toc removal p 0 36 and 0 11 respectively overall results indicated that partial substitution of alum with a high charge density neither improved nor reduced nom removal as compared to the current full scaled plant operations haafp and thmfp in the treated water ranged from 44 to 107 μg l and 24 97 μg l respectively for all dosing conditions applied fig 3 kendall s rank correlation tests found no relationship between residual toc concentration and haafp p 0 2518 however a weak positive correlation was identified with thmfp τ 0 26 p 0 0186 this indicates that as residual toc concentrations increased slight increases in thmfp were also recorded when the entire dataset was considered i e raw and treated water significant positive correlations were observed between residual toc concentrations and haafp and thmfp τ 0 34 and τ 0 53 respectively fig 4 shows the impacts of alternative coagulant dosing on the ufrv a negative value represented a decrease in the ufrv as compared to the baseline condition pilot plant baseline runs for this study averaged 270 75 m3 m2 and the average ufrv in the full scale plant was 250 50 m3 m2 the addition of 0 5 mg l polyelectrolyte at 12 mg l of alum did not significant impact the ufrv p 0 96 similarly supplementing a lowered alum dose 10 mg l with 0 5 mg l of polyelectrolyte also resulted in equivalent ufrv as compared to the baseline p 0 75 however when 1 mg l of polyelectrolyte was applied with a lowered alum dose there was a significant decrease in the urfv p 0 01 analysis of simplified head loss profiles for all trials fig 5 indicated increased rates of development with the addition of polyelectrolyte as compared to baseline conditions simplified turbidity profiles fig 5 showed improved effluent turbidity with the exception of trial 1 when comparing runs with polyelectrolyte to baseline conditions during trial 2 spikes in effluent turbidity were observed under baseline conditions but were minimized when polyelectrolyte was used as a coagulant aid fig a 3 improved effluent turbidity with polyelectrolyte was also recorded in preliminary trials where a lowered alum dose 10 mg l without polyelectrolyte resulted in high effluent turbidity such that the filters were unable to ripen fig a 4 the addition of polyelectrolyte 0 5 mg l at the same alum dose improved filter runs up to the maximum of 80 h fig a 4 the cause for termination of filter runs in the study were variable however in trials with higher coagulant doses i e 12 mg l alum with 0 5 mg l polyelectrolyte and 10 mg l alum and 1 mg l polyelectrolyte turbidity breakthrough was most common 3 2 increased effective size of filter media and extended filter bed depth results from a paired t test comparing filters f fsp and f es1 3 indicated that switching the filter media layout did not impact the toc removal 95 ci for the difference in the means was 1 173 to 0 223 conversely the ufrv improved by 3 16 to 16 19 m3 m2 when the es and bed depth were increased simplified head loss and effluent turbidity profiles for f fsp and f es1 3 are compared for identical dosing conditions in fig 5 a clear reduction in the rate of head loss development was observed with the higher es media and extended filter bed depth furthermore the alternative filter media layout f es1 3 produced equivalent turbidity profiles to the baseline f fsp filter runs in f es1 3 did not terminate due to head loss which was the cause of termination for five of the 11 runs in f fsp the majority of the filter runs in f es1 3 ended as a result of turbidity breakthrough 0 2 ntu and four reached the maximum run time of 80 h 4 discussion 4 1 combined use of cationic polyelectrolyte and alum toc removal and residual toc concentrations were not impacted by the changes in coagulant dosing studied fig 2 this was contradictory to previous findings that reported improved removal of organic matter with the addition of poly diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride polydadmac in doses ranging from 0 5 10 mg l 15 20 pernitsky et al 21 also reported improved removal of uv254 absorbing material by substituting 0 6 mg l as al of alum with 4 mg l of a high charge density cationic polyelectrolyte nonetheless the toc removal percentages measured in this study were consistent with expected values based on the nature of doc in the raw water raw water suva values for the period of study averaged 3 4 l mg m but values as low as 2 6 l mg m were recorded for suva values between 3 4 l mg m organic material is typically a mixture of hydrophobic hpo and hydrophilic hpi compounds and doc removal between 40 60 is expected 32 33 the toc removal recorded in this study ranged from 31 to 44 on the lower end of the expected values reported by awwa 33 however fractionation work completed by anderson 34 at the time of this study indicated that hydrophobic neutrals hon represented the largest fraction of the doc 55 in pockwock lake hons can be resistant towards coagulation and removal as low as 10 has been reported for this fraction 32 further a previous study at the jdkwsp compared doc fractions before and after treatment and reported that the hon fraction along with hydrophilic acid hia and hydrophilic base hib fractions were unchanged through the direct filtration treatment plant in the summer months 35 these three fractions represented 62 of the raw water doc during the period of study for the presented work 34 the resistance of the hon and hpi fractions to coagulation is associated to their lack of ionized and reactive carboxylic and phenolic functional groups which are more prominent in the acidic hpo fraction 32 36 consequently the hpi fraction is less likely to react with coagulants which is required for their effective removal 36 further the hpo fractions often dictate the charge demand of coagulation and thus the removal of hpi fractions typically only occurs once the colloidal charge from the hpo fraction is satisfied 36 additionally the hydrophilic neutral fraction hin which was 20 of the untreated doc at the time of this study 34 can have suva values between 3 5 4 l mg m this can cause a shift towards higher source water suva values and potential misinterpretation of expected doc removal because this fraction is not readily removed with coagulation 32 33 therefore despite a high fraction of hydrophobic nom in the raw water toc removal was expected to be on the lower end of the 40 60 range typical of supplies with suva values between 3 and 4 l mg m additional tests at 14 and 16 mg l of alum and no polyelectrolyte showed minimal improvement 5 in toc removal when compared to the initial tests conducted in this study table a 1 and removal was not improved by increasing the alum dose from 14 to 16 mg l furthermore the zeta potential measurements taken on flocculated water fig 6 were within the recommended 10 to 5 mv range for effective charge neutralization 21 it is therefore suggested that toc removal was near optimal values for the current concentration and character of nom in the surface water so increasing the coagulant dose will have minimal impact on the treated water quality the lack of improved treatment efficacy under the alternative coagulant dosing conditions was also highlighted by the concentration of dbps in the treated water samples which were consistent throughout the study it is widely cited that the hydrophobic fraction is the largest contributor to dbp precursor material in raw waters however this is also the fraction that is most readily removed with coagulation 37 40 therefore it is the fraction that is recalcitrant to coagulation that controls post coagulation nom concentrations 36 and in turn dbp formation 38 it is likely that the dbp precursor material persisting post coagulation was of this nature because dbpfp was not improved with lower residual toc concentrations fig 3 this theory was supported by the suva values of the treated water which were all 2 l mg m implying mainly hydrophilic nom 32 additionally montreuil 35 found similar results for treatment at the jdkwsp where the hydrophobic fraction had a large contribution to the dbpfp in the raw water but the treated water was dominated by hydrophilic dbp precursors increased removal of nom should therefore be targeting the dbp precursors that remain after coagulation under the current treatment conditions this targeted treatment may require additional plant upgrades application of technologies such as biofiltration 41 membrane filtration 38 42 adsorption with granular activated carbon 43 and magnetic ion exchange resin 39 44 have all previously been used to remove dbp precursors that are more resistant to treatment with coagulation however to achieve longevity in treatment plant design understanding the network of factors that impact the concentration and character of nom e g lake recovery from acidification changing climate land use and its reactivity with disinfectants is critical treatment strategies should be based on long term and seasonal trends in the amount and nature of nom identified through detailed high resolution monitoring further utilities observing shifts in the water quality of their supply should consider upgrading to adaptable treatment processes e g modular treatment units that can be periodically brought online for energy savings to mitigate seasonal or unexpected shifts in source water quality the second aspect of the cationic polyelectrolyte study was to investigate its impact on treatment efficiency as measured by the ufrv past work has shown that the partial substitution of alum with cationic polyelectrolyte can increase water production where combinations of the two coagulants have increased ufrv up to 50 21 and extended filter runs cycles 16 however such an effect was not observed in the presented work the lack of improvement in ufrv was likely due to the increased rate of head loss development observed with the addition of polyelectrolyte fig 5 one proposed mechanism for the increased rate of head loss is an increase in floc size when polyelectrolyte was used as a coagulant the addition of polyelectrolyte may have caused a degree of bridging between flocculated particles which occurs when the tails of the adsorbed polyelectrolyte extend outside the electrical double layer of the colloid and act as bridges between multiple flocs 18 bridged flocs are typically larger than those produced with charge neutralization as they are stronger and can resist breakage at higher shears 16 18 45 the larger flocs are less likely to have deep penetration into the filter bed increasing the rate of head loss development resulting in shorter filter runs 22 another possible mechanism for the reductions in ufrv is polymer carryover this occurs when polyelectrolyte is overdosed in coagulation and binds to the filter media carryover is represented by high positive zeta potentials indicating that the desired neutral surface charge of particles in the raw water has been achieved and polyelectrolyte was applied in excess 18 overdosing is also often indicated by increased effluent turbidity as the increased concentration of positively charged species can cause charge reversal and restabilization of nom colloids 18 as per fig 6 zeta potential measurements were near zero or negative and fig 5 indicates similar turbidity profiles for trials with and without polyelectrolyte it is therefore unlikely that polymer carryover was a significant cause for the increased head loss further investigation into the volume of sludge produced e g mass balance calculations floc penetration into the filter bed e g filter surveillance and the size of flocs e g image analysis laser diffraction formed under different coagulant dosing would give additional insight into the mechanisms affecting the filter hydraulic performance the use of polyelectrolyte may be a practical strategy for turbidity control when baseline alum doses are insufficient e g in the event of a turbidity spike from heavy precipitation windstorms or other weather events as seen in fig a 4 effluent turbidity was satisfactory with the addition of polyelectrolyte when alum doses alone were insufficient for filter ripening 0 2 ntu the use of polyelectrolyte instead of alum to control spikes in raw water turbidity could result in lowered sludge volumes and increased water production this may have beneficial implications as the frequency of extreme weather events is anticipated to increase with climate warming 46 on top of evaluating the functionality of cationic polyelectrolytes their financial impact should also be considered polyelectrolytes are more expensive than alum however the lower doses required for effective treatment and reduced dependence on ph controlling chemicals in coagulation may result in cost savings 17 18 47 48 for example nozaic et al 47 reported a 30 reduction in chemical costs when switching from alum to cationic polyelectrolyte additional factors such as reduced energy consumption in chemical pumping and backwashing have also resulted in cost savings 47 48 4 2 increased effective size of filter media and extended bed depth previous reports have found that the decline in filtrate water quality anticipated with a coarser media can be offset by extending the bed depth and maintaining the length to depth ratio l d 49 50 the adjustment in depth results in a greater total surface area available for particle contact 49 and total volume of pores in the filter bed 51 increasing the overall capacity for particle and turbidity removal the l d ratio in f fsp mimicking the full scale plant filter layout was 1288 where that of f es1 3 was 1315 therefore the equivalent toc removal and effluent turbidity profiles observed for the two filter designs figs a 2 and 5 respectively were expected results the extended filter run times and subsequent increase in ufrv in f es1 3 as compared to f fsp were associated to the slower rates of head loss development observed in f es1 3 with coarser media flocs penetrate deeper into the filter bed and the captured solids are spread over a larger volume of media reducing the head loss 22 49 this strategy has been successfully used in practice to reduce rates of filter clogging 52 further tchio et al 51 reported that coarse media es of 2 mm was more suitable as compared to fine media es of 0 4 mm for deep beds at lower filtration rates 5 m hr the filter loading rates used in this study 4 5 m hr were comparable to those reported by tchio et al 51 despite the hydraulic advantages of coarser filter media greater passage of flocs has been reported with an increased es as the passage of smaller particles through the filter bed is facilitated by the wider pores 51 this has the potential to cause increased effluent turbidity 26 51 coarser anthracite also leads to a greater deposit of solids in the sand layer of the dual media filter and can ultimately result in saturation of the sand media and turbidity breakthrough 16 it is likely that this mechanism was reflected in the findings as seven of the 11 trials in f es1 3 were terminated due to abrupt increases in effluent turbidity therefore when switching to coarser filter media as a strategy to increase the water production in direct filtration plants a pilot scaled investigation into the potential changes in effluent water quality and turbidity breakthrough should be completed 5 conclusions multiple strategies were assessed in attempts to improve the efficacy and efficiency of direct filtration treatment plants facing changing source water quality as a result of lake recovery from acidification and climatic factors combinations of alum 10 12 mg l and high charge density cationic polyelectrolyte 0 1 mg l were tested in a direct filtration pilot plant to evaluate nom removal and ufrv additionally the impacts of increasing the effective size of the filter media from 0 9 mm to 1 3 mm on effluent water quality and filter hydraulic performance were analyzed the addition of polyelectrolyte in coagulation did not improve nom removal as measured by toc which was consistent around 35 40 for all dosing combinations tested however it did show the potential for controlling spikes in raw water turbidity the partial substitution of alum with cationic polyelectrolyte did not improve treatment efficiency as measured by the ufrv on the other hand increasing the es of filter media did improve ufrv by 3 16 to 16 19 m3 m2 without compromising the treated water quality this strategy could be applied to increase treatment efficiency under current chemical dosing or maintain efficiency if increased coagulant doses are required in the future finally this research highlighted the importance of understanding projected trends in the concentration

13698,lake recovery from acidification and climatic drivers are causing increasing concentrations of natural organic matter nom in surface waters across north american and europe these shifts in source water quality have caused challenges in the drinking water treatment industry particularly in direct filtration plants which are sensitive to changes in influent water quality there is a need for immediate treatment strategies to address the increasing organic load while sustainable solutions are developed the presented research investigated the impacts of partially substituting aluminum sulphate alum with a high charge density cationic polyelectrolyte on nom removal and unit filter run volume ufrv in a direct filtration pilot plant various combinations of alum 10 12 mg l and polyelectrolyte 0 1 mg l were compared to the current full scale plant dose of 12 mg l of alum the impacts of increasing the effective size of the filter media from 0 9 mm to 1 3 mm on nom removal and ufrv were also studied the partial substitution of alum with polyelectrolyte did not significantly impact total organic carbon toc removal which was consistent around 35 40 or toc residual concentrations which were approximately 2 1 2 3 mg l the ufrv was not impacted by the partial substitution of alum with polyelectrolyte but increasing the effective size did improve the ufrv by 3 to 16 m3 m2 without impacting the effluent water quality additionally the research highlighted the importance of understanding projected trends in the concentration and character of source water nom for sustainable drinking water treatment design keywords natural organic matter direct filtration recovery from acidification coagulation cationic polyelectrolyte 1 introduction over the last few decades increasing concentrations of natural organic matter nom measured as dissolved organic carbon doc have been recorded in lakes across many regions in northern america and europe 1 3 this trend has often been associated with recovery from acidification a phenomenon defined as increasing acid neutralization capacity alkalinity or ph in response to reduced atmospheric acid deposition 4 5 the concentration and character of nom in surface waters are also impacted by climatic factors including extreme weather events e g heavy precipitation droughts and warming temperatures which often lead to increased seasonal fluctuation in surface water quality 6 10 increasing concentration of doc in water supplies has multiple design implications in the drinking water treatment industry as the primary precursor for disinfection by products dbps a higher concentration of organic material in the supply can result in higher concentrations of dbps in the treated water drinking water treatment plants have also reported concomitant increases in chemical dosing e g coagulants ph controlling chemicals disinfectants in response to the positive trend in source water doc concentrations 11 13 the efficacy of nom removal in treatment with aluminum sulphate alum depends on the nature of the nom in the source water and the concentration and character of the hydrolysis species formed from the alum however increased alum doses due to higher doc concentrations will result in greater concentrations of metal hydroxide precipitates and larger volumes of sludge produced in the treatment process in direct filtration treatment plants this can lead to shorter filter runs more frequent backwashing and reduced water production for this reason direct filtration plants are often designed for low turbidity low organic content source waters and thus are particularly vulnerable to changes in source water quality such as increasing concentration of doc 14 the partial substitution of alum with a high charge density cationic polyelectrolyte is a common practice in direct filtration as it offers the benefit of charge neutralization capacity without additional solid loading from a precipitating coagulant such as alum 15 17 consequently unit filter run volumes ufrv can be increased as a result of reduced production of sludge from lowered alum doses 18 20 the combination of high charge density cationic polyelectrolyte with alum has been successful in pilot and full scaled direct filtration plants where reduced effluent turbidity 20 increased removal of ultraviolet adsorbing material at 254 nm uv254 15 and extend filter runs 16 21 have been achieved another strategy used to extend filter cycles is to increase the effective size es of the filter media coarser media allows for deeper penetration of incoming particulates into the filter bed resulting in an extension of solids retention over larger depths of the filter bed and in turn reduced rates of head loss development 22 nearly all the direct filtration plants in north america were built prior to the 1990s 14 21 before noticeable shifts in source water quality 2 5 23 some of these plants were designed based on acidified water quality conditions and due to more recent shifts in source water quality are currently operating near or outside their design guidelines 11 24 given that treatment plant upgrades can span over a period of years there is a need for immediate strategies to account for the changing source water quality while more significant and sustainable upgrades are researched designed and constructed however there exists a gap in the literature pertaining to adaptive strategies for utilities facing these changes instead the majority of literature surrounding this topic is focused on the phenomenon and mechanisms of change in source water quality caused by lake recovery from acidification or climatic factors the presented work addresses the identified gap by investigating strategies to improve the efficacy and efficiency of direct filtration treatment plants facing the stress of increasing concentrations of doc first the efficacy of nom and dbp precursor material removal was assessed by studying combinations of cationic polyelectrolyte and alum in coagulation these coagulant dosing combinations were also evaluated for treatment efficiency based on water production second the impact of increasing the es of filter media and extending the filter bed depth on the effluent water quality and ufrv were determined 2 materials and methods 2 1 j d kline water supply plant and pockwock lake the j d kline water supply plant jdkwsp is a direct filtration drinking water treatment plant in the halifax regional municipality of nova scotia canada and consists of pre screening oxidation pre chlorination coagulation flocculation dual media filtration and chlorination it is operated by halifax water at an average flow of 85 megalitres per day mld the source water for the jdkwsp is pockwock lake a low turbidity 1 ntu low alkalinity 5 mg l as caco3 lake which drains a protected watershed raw water characteristics for the period of study based on weekly analysis are presented in table 1 the water quality of pockwock lake is approaching the upper thresholds of some design guidelines for direct filtration plants valade et al 14 recommended that water drawn for treatment with direct filtration have an average annual total organic carbon toc concentration less than 3 mg l a value that pockwock lake has surpassed since the jdkwsp was commissioned in 1977 11 consequently the alum dose recently increased from 8 to 12 mg l although this is within the range of maximum alum doses recommended for direct filtration plants 10 15 mg l 25 27 it leaves little room for adjustment in response to further fluctuations in source water quality additional treatment challenges at the jdkwsp include reduced filter run times and increased formation of dbps 2 2 jdkwsp pilot plant the jdkwsp is equipped with a research pilot plant intuitech inc fig 1 comprised of two identical and parallel direct filtration treatment trains that simulate the full scale plant treatment process 28 for the duration of the study one of the trains was continuously operated under baseline conditions that were equivalent to the chemical dosing applied at the full scale plant this dosing was consistent at 12 mg l of alum the second train was used to investigate the alternative coagulation conditions pockwock lake water was supplied to the pilot plant at an average flow rate of 10 l min in the pre mix tanks potassium permanganate kmno4 was added for the oxidation of iron and manganese and sodium hypochlorite naocl was applied for pre chlorination lime ca oh 2 and carbon dioxide co2 were used to maintain a coagulation ph of 5 8 alum and cationic polyelectrolyte were added simultaneously in the final stage of pre mixing which was followed by three stage tapered flocculation 30 20 and 10 s 1 the flocculated water was then pumped to the filtration skid each filtration skid consisted of three 200 mm dual media anthracite and sand filter columns through which the flow was evenly distributed at a constant loading rate of 4 5 m hr the first filter column f fsp or the baseline simulated the full scale plant filtration bed design and was comprised of 61 cm of anthracite es of 0 9 mm and 30 5 cm of silica sand the second filter media layout f es0 9 had 91 5 cm of anthracite es 0 9 mm and 30 5 cm of sand the third filter column f es1 3 had 91 5 cm of anthracite es 1 3 mm and 30 5 cm of sand filter runs were terminated when the effluent turbidity exceeded 0 2 ntu the head loss across the filter was greater than 2 15 m or the filter run exceeded 80 h the pilot plant was not equipped for additional treatment after filtration 2 3 chemical reagents the primary coagulant used was liquid aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 14h2o chemtrade and the cationic polyelectrolyte was floquant fl 2449 snf canada fl 2449 is a high charge density linear polyamine with approximately 50 active content it was selected due to its high charge density and low viscosity as compared to other cationic polyelectrolytes 2 4 experimental procedures the use of cationic polyelectrolyte in conjunction with alum was investigated by comparing alum doses of 10 and 12 mg l with polyelectrolyte doses of 0 5 and 1 mg l to baseline conditions of 12 mg l of alum with no polyelectrolyte each trial consisted of one complete filter run through each of the three filter columns filter runs were terminated due to turbidity breakthrough 0 2 ntu terminal head loss 2 15 m or after 80 h two trials were completed for each alternative dosing condition equating to a total of six data points per dosing condition when all three columns were considered the coagulation ph was consistent at 5 8 throughout the entire study grab samples were collected simultaneously from the pilot plant raw flow and from each filter effluent once the effluent water quality had reached an equilibrium typically after 24 h the samples were analyzed for toc doc uv254 and disinfection by product formation potential dbpfp flocculated water samples were also collected for analysis of zeta potential filter hydraulic performance was evaluated based on the ufrv and turbidity and head loss profiles the filter hydraulic performance of f fsp and f es1 3 were compared under identical chemical dosing described previously to determine the impact of increasing the es of the filter media and extending the depth of the filter effluent toc ufrv and head loss and turbidity profiles were used as response parameters the aforementioned experiments were conducted from april 2019 to july 2019 therefore the results have limited seasonal variation 2 5 analytical procedures when applicable laboratory analysis and procedures were completed in accordance with standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 29 toc and doc samples were prepared following standard methods 5310 and measured with a toc analyzer shimadzu toc vcph uv254 was measured on a hach dr5000 uv vis spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 254 nm and used for calculation of specific uv absorbance suva samples were prepped for dbpfp namely trihalomethane formation potential thmfp and haloacetic acid formation potential haafp following a modified version of standard methods 5710 the samples were buffered to a ph of 8 and chlorine was dosed such that the free chlorine residual was 1 0 0 4 mg l after a 24 h incubation period the concentrations of haas and thms in the incubated samples were measured using gas chromatography with electron capture us environmental protection agency methods 552 2 and 551 1 respectively zeta potential was measured on a malvern panalytical zetasizer nano zs in line water quality parameters temperature ph turbidity were measured at critical points throughout the pilot plant treatment process and filter hydraulic performance was evaluated with continuous head loss and flow monitoring across each filter bed 2 6 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted with r 30 31 paired t tests were used to compare the response of alternative coagulation conditions to baseline conditions analysis of variance anova was used to determine if the filter media layouts produced equivalent effluent water quality kendall s tau correlations were applied to understand relationships between treated water quality parameters tests for normality were conducted with the shapiro wilks test and the level of significance for all statistical tests was 0 05 3 results 3 1 combined use of cationic polyelectrolyte and alum as the majority of toc in both the raw 102 4 6 and treated 99 8 water was in the dissolved form toc measurements were used to represent nom in the presented analysis in comparing residual toc concentrations fig a 1 and toc removal fig a 2 for the three filter media layouts with anova the effluent water quality was equivalent and thus results from the three media layouts were summarized fig 2 toc removal ranged from 31 to 44 for all four dosing combinations shown in fig 2 at a constant alum dose of 12 mg l there was no statistically significant difference in the means of residual toc when 0 5 mg l of polyelectrolyte was added compared to when it was not p 0 24 likewise toc removal was consistent 38 at an alum dose of 12 mg l with or without the addition of polyelectrolyte p 0 59 when alum was partially substituted with polyelectrolyte i e comparing 12 mg l of alum to 10 mg l of alum with 0 5 and 1 mg l of polyelectrolyte there was again no significant improvement or reduction in toc removal p 0 36 and 0 11 respectively overall results indicated that partial substitution of alum with a high charge density neither improved nor reduced nom removal as compared to the current full scaled plant operations haafp and thmfp in the treated water ranged from 44 to 107 μg l and 24 97 μg l respectively for all dosing conditions applied fig 3 kendall s rank correlation tests found no relationship between residual toc concentration and haafp p 0 2518 however a weak positive correlation was identified with thmfp τ 0 26 p 0 0186 this indicates that as residual toc concentrations increased slight increases in thmfp were also recorded when the entire dataset was considered i e raw and treated water significant positive correlations were observed between residual toc concentrations and haafp and thmfp τ 0 34 and τ 0 53 respectively fig 4 shows the impacts of alternative coagulant dosing on the ufrv a negative value represented a decrease in the ufrv as compared to the baseline condition pilot plant baseline runs for this study averaged 270 75 m3 m2 and the average ufrv in the full scale plant was 250 50 m3 m2 the addition of 0 5 mg l polyelectrolyte at 12 mg l of alum did not significant impact the ufrv p 0 96 similarly supplementing a lowered alum dose 10 mg l with 0 5 mg l of polyelectrolyte also resulted in equivalent ufrv as compared to the baseline p 0 75 however when 1 mg l of polyelectrolyte was applied with a lowered alum dose there was a significant decrease in the urfv p 0 01 analysis of simplified head loss profiles for all trials fig 5 indicated increased rates of development with the addition of polyelectrolyte as compared to baseline conditions simplified turbidity profiles fig 5 showed improved effluent turbidity with the exception of trial 1 when comparing runs with polyelectrolyte to baseline conditions during trial 2 spikes in effluent turbidity were observed under baseline conditions but were minimized when polyelectrolyte was used as a coagulant aid fig a 3 improved effluent turbidity with polyelectrolyte was also recorded in preliminary trials where a lowered alum dose 10 mg l without polyelectrolyte resulted in high effluent turbidity such that the filters were unable to ripen fig a 4 the addition of polyelectrolyte 0 5 mg l at the same alum dose improved filter runs up to the maximum of 80 h fig a 4 the cause for termination of filter runs in the study were variable however in trials with higher coagulant doses i e 12 mg l alum with 0 5 mg l polyelectrolyte and 10 mg l alum and 1 mg l polyelectrolyte turbidity breakthrough was most common 3 2 increased effective size of filter media and extended filter bed depth results from a paired t test comparing filters f fsp and f es1 3 indicated that switching the filter media layout did not impact the toc removal 95 ci for the difference in the means was 1 173 to 0 223 conversely the ufrv improved by 3 16 to 16 19 m3 m2 when the es and bed depth were increased simplified head loss and effluent turbidity profiles for f fsp and f es1 3 are compared for identical dosing conditions in fig 5 a clear reduction in the rate of head loss development was observed with the higher es media and extended filter bed depth furthermore the alternative filter media layout f es1 3 produced equivalent turbidity profiles to the baseline f fsp filter runs in f es1 3 did not terminate due to head loss which was the cause of termination for five of the 11 runs in f fsp the majority of the filter runs in f es1 3 ended as a result of turbidity breakthrough 0 2 ntu and four reached the maximum run time of 80 h 4 discussion 4 1 combined use of cationic polyelectrolyte and alum toc removal and residual toc concentrations were not impacted by the changes in coagulant dosing studied fig 2 this was contradictory to previous findings that reported improved removal of organic matter with the addition of poly diallyldimethyl ammonium chloride polydadmac in doses ranging from 0 5 10 mg l 15 20 pernitsky et al 21 also reported improved removal of uv254 absorbing material by substituting 0 6 mg l as al of alum with 4 mg l of a high charge density cationic polyelectrolyte nonetheless the toc removal percentages measured in this study were consistent with expected values based on the nature of doc in the raw water raw water suva values for the period of study averaged 3 4 l mg m but values as low as 2 6 l mg m were recorded for suva values between 3 4 l mg m organic material is typically a mixture of hydrophobic hpo and hydrophilic hpi compounds and doc removal between 40 60 is expected 32 33 the toc removal recorded in this study ranged from 31 to 44 on the lower end of the expected values reported by awwa 33 however fractionation work completed by anderson 34 at the time of this study indicated that hydrophobic neutrals hon represented the largest fraction of the doc 55 in pockwock lake hons can be resistant towards coagulation and removal as low as 10 has been reported for this fraction 32 further a previous study at the jdkwsp compared doc fractions before and after treatment and reported that the hon fraction along with hydrophilic acid hia and hydrophilic base hib fractions were unchanged through the direct filtration treatment plant in the summer months 35 these three fractions represented 62 of the raw water doc during the period of study for the presented work 34 the resistance of the hon and hpi fractions to coagulation is associated to their lack of ionized and reactive carboxylic and phenolic functional groups which are more prominent in the acidic hpo fraction 32 36 consequently the hpi fraction is less likely to react with coagulants which is required for their effective removal 36 further the hpo fractions often dictate the charge demand of coagulation and thus the removal of hpi fractions typically only occurs once the colloidal charge from the hpo fraction is satisfied 36 additionally the hydrophilic neutral fraction hin which was 20 of the untreated doc at the time of this study 34 can have suva values between 3 5 4 l mg m this can cause a shift towards higher source water suva values and potential misinterpretation of expected doc removal because this fraction is not readily removed with coagulation 32 33 therefore despite a high fraction of hydrophobic nom in the raw water toc removal was expected to be on the lower end of the 40 60 range typical of supplies with suva values between 3 and 4 l mg m additional tests at 14 and 16 mg l of alum and no polyelectrolyte showed minimal improvement 5 in toc removal when compared to the initial tests conducted in this study table a 1 and removal was not improved by increasing the alum dose from 14 to 16 mg l furthermore the zeta potential measurements taken on flocculated water fig 6 were within the recommended 10 to 5 mv range for effective charge neutralization 21 it is therefore suggested that toc removal was near optimal values for the current concentration and character of nom in the surface water so increasing the coagulant dose will have minimal impact on the treated water quality the lack of improved treatment efficacy under the alternative coagulant dosing conditions was also highlighted by the concentration of dbps in the treated water samples which were consistent throughout the study it is widely cited that the hydrophobic fraction is the largest contributor to dbp precursor material in raw waters however this is also the fraction that is most readily removed with coagulation 37 40 therefore it is the fraction that is recalcitrant to coagulation that controls post coagulation nom concentrations 36 and in turn dbp formation 38 it is likely that the dbp precursor material persisting post coagulation was of this nature because dbpfp was not improved with lower residual toc concentrations fig 3 this theory was supported by the suva values of the treated water which were all 2 l mg m implying mainly hydrophilic nom 32 additionally montreuil 35 found similar results for treatment at the jdkwsp where the hydrophobic fraction had a large contribution to the dbpfp in the raw water but the treated water was dominated by hydrophilic dbp precursors increased removal of nom should therefore be targeting the dbp precursors that remain after coagulation under the current treatment conditions this targeted treatment may require additional plant upgrades application of technologies such as biofiltration 41 membrane filtration 38 42 adsorption with granular activated carbon 43 and magnetic ion exchange resin 39 44 have all previously been used to remove dbp precursors that are more resistant to treatment with coagulation however to achieve longevity in treatment plant design understanding the network of factors that impact the concentration and character of nom e g lake recovery from acidification changing climate land use and its reactivity with disinfectants is critical treatment strategies should be based on long term and seasonal trends in the amount and nature of nom identified through detailed high resolution monitoring further utilities observing shifts in the water quality of their supply should consider upgrading to adaptable treatment processes e g modular treatment units that can be periodically brought online for energy savings to mitigate seasonal or unexpected shifts in source water quality the second aspect of the cationic polyelectrolyte study was to investigate its impact on treatment efficiency as measured by the ufrv past work has shown that the partial substitution of alum with cationic polyelectrolyte can increase water production where combinations of the two coagulants have increased ufrv up to 50 21 and extended filter runs cycles 16 however such an effect was not observed in the presented work the lack of improvement in ufrv was likely due to the increased rate of head loss development observed with the addition of polyelectrolyte fig 5 one proposed mechanism for the increased rate of head loss is an increase in floc size when polyelectrolyte was used as a coagulant the addition of polyelectrolyte may have caused a degree of bridging between flocculated particles which occurs when the tails of the adsorbed polyelectrolyte extend outside the electrical double layer of the colloid and act as bridges between multiple flocs 18 bridged flocs are typically larger than those produced with charge neutralization as they are stronger and can resist breakage at higher shears 16 18 45 the larger flocs are less likely to have deep penetration into the filter bed increasing the rate of head loss development resulting in shorter filter runs 22 another possible mechanism for the reductions in ufrv is polymer carryover this occurs when polyelectrolyte is overdosed in coagulation and binds to the filter media carryover is represented by high positive zeta potentials indicating that the desired neutral surface charge of particles in the raw water has been achieved and polyelectrolyte was applied in excess 18 overdosing is also often indicated by increased effluent turbidity as the increased concentration of positively charged species can cause charge reversal and restabilization of nom colloids 18 as per fig 6 zeta potential measurements were near zero or negative and fig 5 indicates similar turbidity profiles for trials with and without polyelectrolyte it is therefore unlikely that polymer carryover was a significant cause for the increased head loss further investigation into the volume of sludge produced e g mass balance calculations floc penetration into the filter bed e g filter surveillance and the size of flocs e g image analysis laser diffraction formed under different coagulant dosing would give additional insight into the mechanisms affecting the filter hydraulic performance the use of polyelectrolyte may be a practical strategy for turbidity control when baseline alum doses are insufficient e g in the event of a turbidity spike from heavy precipitation windstorms or other weather events as seen in fig a 4 effluent turbidity was satisfactory with the addition of polyelectrolyte when alum doses alone were insufficient for filter ripening 0 2 ntu the use of polyelectrolyte instead of alum to control spikes in raw water turbidity could result in lowered sludge volumes and increased water production this may have beneficial implications as the frequency of extreme weather events is anticipated to increase with climate warming 46 on top of evaluating the functionality of cationic polyelectrolytes their financial impact should also be considered polyelectrolytes are more expensive than alum however the lower doses required for effective treatment and reduced dependence on ph controlling chemicals in coagulation may result in cost savings 17 18 47 48 for example nozaic et al 47 reported a 30 reduction in chemical costs when switching from alum to cationic polyelectrolyte additional factors such as reduced energy consumption in chemical pumping and backwashing have also resulted in cost savings 47 48 4 2 increased effective size of filter media and extended bed depth previous reports have found that the decline in filtrate water quality anticipated with a coarser media can be offset by extending the bed depth and maintaining the length to depth ratio l d 49 50 the adjustment in depth results in a greater total surface area available for particle contact 49 and total volume of pores in the filter bed 51 increasing the overall capacity for particle and turbidity removal the l d ratio in f fsp mimicking the full scale plant filter layout was 1288 where that of f es1 3 was 1315 therefore the equivalent toc removal and effluent turbidity profiles observed for the two filter designs figs a 2 and 5 respectively were expected results the extended filter run times and subsequent increase in ufrv in f es1 3 as compared to f fsp were associated to the slower rates of head loss development observed in f es1 3 with coarser media flocs penetrate deeper into the filter bed and the captured solids are spread over a larger volume of media reducing the head loss 22 49 this strategy has been successfully used in practice to reduce rates of filter clogging 52 further tchio et al 51 reported that coarse media es of 2 mm was more suitable as compared to fine media es of 0 4 mm for deep beds at lower filtration rates 5 m hr the filter loading rates used in this study 4 5 m hr were comparable to those reported by tchio et al 51 despite the hydraulic advantages of coarser filter media greater passage of flocs has been reported with an increased es as the passage of smaller particles through the filter bed is facilitated by the wider pores 51 this has the potential to cause increased effluent turbidity 26 51 coarser anthracite also leads to a greater deposit of solids in the sand layer of the dual media filter and can ultimately result in saturation of the sand media and turbidity breakthrough 16 it is likely that this mechanism was reflected in the findings as seven of the 11 trials in f es1 3 were terminated due to abrupt increases in effluent turbidity therefore when switching to coarser filter media as a strategy to increase the water production in direct filtration plants a pilot scaled investigation into the potential changes in effluent water quality and turbidity breakthrough should be completed 5 conclusions multiple strategies were assessed in attempts to improve the efficacy and efficiency of direct filtration treatment plants facing changing source water quality as a result of lake recovery from acidification and climatic factors combinations of alum 10 12 mg l and high charge density cationic polyelectrolyte 0 1 mg l were tested in a direct filtration pilot plant to evaluate nom removal and ufrv additionally the impacts of increasing the effective size of the filter media from 0 9 mm to 1 3 mm on effluent water quality and filter hydraulic performance were analyzed the addition of polyelectrolyte in coagulation did not improve nom removal as measured by toc which was consistent around 35 40 for all dosing combinations tested however it did show the potential for controlling spikes in raw water turbidity the partial substitution of alum with cationic polyelectrolyte did not improve treatment efficiency as measured by the ufrv on the other hand increasing the es of filter media did improve ufrv by 3 16 to 16 19 m3 m2 without compromising the treated water quality this strategy could be applied to increase treatment efficiency under current chemical dosing or maintain efficiency if increased coagulant doses are required in the future finally this research highlighted the importance of understanding projected trends in the concentration and character of source water nom and dbp precursor material caused by factors such as lake recovery and climate change in sustainable plant design as these drivers will ultimately determine future

13699,water soluble dyes are common persistent organic pollutants present in textile wastewater which are associated with environmental pollution and health hazards the conventional effluent treatment methods are not efficient to remove these dyes from textile wastewater heat activated persulfate based wastewater treatment is a promising advanced oxidation process aop for the treatment of textile wastewater therefore the main objective of the present work was to study the degradation of sudan black b sbb dye in aqueous solution by varying activation temperature 40 60 c kps dosage 250 750 ppm and initial dye concentration 20 50 ppm the dye degradation was found in a range of 35 100 for varied experimental conditions removal percentages were improved by the increase of temperature time and persulfate concentration but decreased with the increase of initial dye concentration the kinetic study indicated that the degradation of sbb dye using kps followed first order model with rate constants varied in a range of 0 15 10 2 40 5 10 2 min 1 standard reaction enthalpies δh standard gibbs free energies δg activation energies ea standard entropies δs were found in a range of 190 505 kj mole 1 33 0 0 6 kj 73 222 kj mole 1 0 6 1 6 kj k for different sets of experimental conditions respectively degradation reactions of sbb dye were endothermic δh ve non spontaneous δg ve at 40 c but spontaneous δg ve at other temperatures 50 c and 60 c therefore it can be predicted that heat activated persulfate is an efficient method to achieve faster degradation of dye in the treatment of industrial wastewaters containing sbb dye keywords persulfate oxidation advanced oxidation process kinetics thermodynamics sudan black b gibbs free energy 1 introduction industrial wastewater pollution is one of the biggest challenges of the twenty first century according to the world bank 17 to 20 of total industrial wastewater is generated from textile industries 34 and every year around 280 000 tons of dyestuffs are discharged into water sinks through textile effluents 6 these effluents are composed of a high concentration of salts and dyestuffs intense color high chemical oxygen demand cod relatively low biological oxygen demand bod high concentration of total dissolved solids tds and suspended solids ss 12 13 literature reported that the wastewater containing azo dyestuffs is toxic and carcinogenic to humans animals and all aquatic living organisms and therefore an environment friendly innovative and efficient treatment technique is urgently required to dispose of this wastewater into the water receiving body with minimal interruption of the ecosystem conventional biological and chemical processes coagulation flocculation are not efficient 4 62 50 however advanced oxidation processes aops are effective and efficient for the treatment of textile wastewater furthermore an aop aop is sometimes integrated with other processes like biological treatment for cost effective textile wastewater treatment 59 in order to degrade and mineralize the organic pollutants in aqueous solution highly reactive and unselective radical hydroxyl radicals oh highest oxidation potential 2 80 ev is generated in the aops 48 different aops including fenton 19 electro fenton 66 uv hydrogen peroxide 57 ozone 61 solar tio2 54 and activated persulfate 42 43 have been applied successfully in the treatment of textile wastewater among them the activated persulfate oxidation potential e 2 01 v process is one of the emerging processes that can mineralize organics through so4 e 2 6 v and oh e 2 8 v 79 21 22 these radicals are created from potassium peroxymonosulfate khso5 pms potassium persulfate k2s2o8 kps or sodium persulfate na2s2o8 sps using thermal transition metal and uv activation methods 80 44 70 so4 is selective in reactions with organic compounds via electron transfer 15 16 but oh is non selective and is capable to mineralize all organic compounds 39 81 24 recently so4 has drawn attention to the removal of organic pollutants from groundwater and wastewater efficiently 23 63 72 the reasons for choosing the activated persulfate are related to high reactivity in the reaction medium stability in room temperature subtle selectivity towards any particular pollutant strong oxidation potential widespread range of reactive operation high aqueous solubility simple operating process availability and cost effectivity 35 49 60 69 the production of a highly reactive so4 and oh radicals are presented in eqns 1 5 15 16 26 1 s2o82 heat 2so4 or 2so4 2 2 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 3 so4 oh so4 2 oh 4 2 oh h2o2 5 h2o2 2 oh from from eqn 1 it can be stated that heat assistance can break down the persulfate into so4 radicals therefore thermal activation or increasing temperature up to an optimum level can increase the reaction rate by increasing persulfate usage rate 30 47 68 however heat activation is preferred because it is an environment friendly in situ chemical oxidation process 51 30 sudan dyes are extensively used in the textile and food industries for coloring purposes and therefore a huge volume of wastewater containing sudan dyes is generated each year previously sudan black b sbb dye degradation using biological processes i e mycoflora 52 microflora 76 bacteria 77 fungus 64 have been studied moreover treatment of sudan dyes using adsorption 67 uv h2o2 11 solar uv tio2 9 electrochemical reduction 45 have been studied to the best of our knowledge no previous research has been performed on the degradation of sbb dye using activated persulfate process yet although the degradation of acid blue 92 3 naphthalene 5 methylene blue 35 ponceau 6r dye 10 sulfamethazine 14 41 trichloroethane 21 carbamazepine 22 propylparaben 32 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 7 metronidazole 53 and other dyes have been studied by the activated persulfate process therefore the main objective of the study was the assessment of the performance of activated potassium persulfate kps on sbb dye degradation in aqueous solution the impact of the activation temperature kps dosage time and dye concentration was investigated in addition degradation kinetics and thermodynamic studies including gibbs free energy activation energy and reaction entropies were also assessed the performances were assessed based on the removal of concentration and color from the dye solution 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials the chemicals and reagents sudan black b c29h24n6 also known as ceres black bn fat black hb and solvent black 3 potassium persulfate k2s2o8 acs reagent grade 99 0 and sulfuric acid acs reagent 95 0 98 0 were purchased from sigma aldrich stock solutions of 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm 50 ppm sbb dye and 250 ppm 500 ppm 750 ppm kps were made in distilled water were preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c and used to prepare the working reaction mixtures 2 2 experimental methods oxidation reactions were conducted in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks placing in a thermostatically controlled water bath certain volumes of sbb stock solution and kps stock solution were mixed to a predefined volume of distilled water in order to get the desired concentration of sbb dye and kps solutions for a particular experiment the effect of kps dosage temperature initial dye concentration and reaction time on the degradation of sbb dye was studied three different temperatures 40 c 50 c and 60 c three kps concentration 250 ppm 500 ppm and 750 ppm and four dye concentrations 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm and 50 ppm were used as experimental parameters here the ph was maintained at 3 by the addition of reagent grade sulfuric acid previously researchers found that a ph around 3 was optimum for dye degradation using persulfate also with increasing ph degradation efficiency decreased 78 80 the temperature was maintained by using a thermostatically controlled water bath and a thermometer was placed in each conical flask to read the temperature of the solution the reaction time was selected 120 min and samples were collected in 20 min intervals after the treatment absorbance and color of the samples were analyzed using shimadzu uv 2600 uv vis spectrophotometer and hach dr6000tm uv vis spectrophotometer respectively the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 598 nm to determine the dye degradation as the maximum peak of sbb dye was observed at this wavelength while the color was measured in pt co unit 2 3 data analysis the removal percentage of dye and color degradations were calculated using eqn 6 7 6 dye degradation dye 0 dye dye 0 100 7 color degradation color 0 color color 0 100 where dye o and dye are the initial and final dye concentrations ppm and color o and color are the initial and final color pt co unit of dye respectively 2 4 kinetic and thermodynamic study the kinetics of the degradation of sbb dye by heat activated potassium persulfate were studied for zeroth order first order and second order process with respect to dye concentration the equations for zeroth order first order and second order models are presented by eqns 8 9 and 10 respectively 8 c 0 c k 0 t 9 ln c 0 c k 1 t 10 1 c 1 c 0 k 2 t where ca ppm and co ppm represent final and initial dye concentration and ko ppm min 1 k1 min 1 and k2 ppm 1 min 1 are zeroth first and second order rate constants respectively 66 the rate constant of the best fitted kinetic model was applied for evaluation of activation energy ea to calculate the ea j mol 1 at different experimental conditions the arrhenius equation given in eqn 11 was used 2 11 k a e e a rt here a is the arrhenius constant k is the reaction rate constant t k is the absolute temperature and r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the molar gas constant this equation was applied in the ln k vs 1 t format where the slope gives the value of e a r from where activation energy ea can be calculated the thermodynamic parameters gibbs free energy δg standard entropy δ s standard reaction enthalpy δ h were evaluated using the following eqn 12 14 12 k e c ae c se 13 δg rt ln ke 14 lnk e δs r δh rt where ke is the equilibrium constant unitless cae and cse are the dye concentration degraded ppm and remained in solution ppm in equilibrium respectively for the solutions where total degradation was achieved the second last data were chosen for calculation eqn 13 is also known as the van t hoff equation 25 38 δg was calculated from eqn 13 and from the plot of ln ke vs 1 t δs and δh were determined eqn 14 3 results and discussion 3 1 dye degradation the impact of temperature initial dye concentration time and kps concentration were studied on the degradation of sbb dye the results have been discussed in the subsequent sections sequentially 3 1 1 temperature effect to study the effect of temperature on the dye degradation the initial dye concentration and kps concentration were kept fixed and the temperature was varied to observe the degradation of dye the concentrations of dye before and after treatment were measured and the results are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 it can be seen that the temperature played an important role in the decomposition of dye using persulfate the degradation of the dye was increased with the increase of temperature for instance the initial dye concentration of 20 ppm was reduced to 11 3 ppm after 120 min of experimental time at 40 c fig 1a which was reduced to 0 7 ppm after 80 min of treatment at 60 c indicating the dye degrading rate was increased with the increase of temperature the percentage of dye removal for 20 ppm dye degradation is presented in fig 2 a after 80 min of treatment the dye removal at 40 c was only 37 which was increased to 97 with the increase of temperature to 60 c previously 100 degradation of the organics aniline 60 c atrazine 90 c 2 4 dichlorophenol 60 c etc was observed after 300 min 120 min and 180 min of treatment respectively using heat activated persulfate 31 33 37 49 in addition the efficiency of acid blue 92 dye degradation was increased linearly with the increase of the bond fission of o o in sps caused by an increase of temperature 58 46 which leading to the production of the active radicals so4 e 2 6 v selective and oh e 2 8 v unselective 18 therefore the possible mechanisms of increased rate of degradation of dye was observed because of the production of more so4 and oh radicals at a higher temperature accoriding to the previous studies the probable mechanisms of production of so4 and oh radicals have been presented by eqns 1 5 5 29 3 in the current study we didn t measure the so4 and oh radicals however we studied the reactions thermodynamics and kinetics the results indicated that the reactions are faster and spontaneous at higher temperature 50 and 60 c however at room temperature the reaction was a sluggish and nonspontaneous the detailed discussion has been provided in subsections 3 3 and 3 4 the 60 c temperature was high enough to degrade more than 96 of sbb dye for a specified concentration of 20 ppm dye and a constant dose 250 ppm of kps therefore further study was carried out to see the impact of temperature on other dye concentrations of 30 40 and 50 ppm and the results are shown in fig 1b d respectively the degradation trends were similar for 30 40 and 50 ppm of dye as we observed for 20 ppm fig 1a however the dye removal rates were decreased fig 2b d as compared to fig 2a indicating that the generated so4 and oh radicals might not be enough in the dye solution to degrade the dye at the increased concentration for a specified 250 ppm of kps dose fig 1e h and i l shows the results for dye degradation of 20 30 40 and 50 mg l for two other fixed dosages of kps concentrations of 500 ppm and 750 ppm respectively for both 500 ppm and 750 ppm kps concentrations the dye degrading trends were similar to the increase of temperature as we observed for kps concentration of 250 ppm for all dye concentrations the dye removal rates were increased with temperature for a fixed dye concentration for instance at a dose of 500 ppm of kps in 20 ppm dye the removal was increased from 57 to 98 for the increase of temperature from 40 to 60 c after 80 min of operation however with the increase of dye concentration the percentage removal of dye was decreased fig 2e h similar trends of dye concentration degradation and percentages removal were observed for 750 ppm kps figs 1i l and 2i l overall the dye degradation rate was increased with temperature and decreased with the increase in dye concentration however it was observed that the increase of kps concentration the degradation rate was increased and faster removal of dye was observed the impact of dye concentration and the addition of kps solution have been discussed further in the subsequent sections 3 1 2 impact of time the operating time is an influential parameter in the sizing and design of the treatment units which influence the energy cost and the investment of a wastewater treatment plant as we observed in figs 1 and 2 the effect of time on the removal efficiency had a pronounced impact on dye degradation under all the conditions the removal efficiencies of dye were increased with time the temperature kps dose and dye concentration affected the degradation time substantially for instance at 60 c 100 dye degradation time for 750 ppm kps 500 ppm kps and 250 ppm kps dose were 17 40 and 100 min respectively for 20 ppm dye treatment these results might be due to the generation of a larger amount of so4 and oh by the higher persulfate dose which accelerated the reaction rate and thus faster degradation of dye this indicates that the operation time required to attain a particular level of treatment can be reduced at a higher kps dose and therefore the designing of an experiment for optimal time can yield a better result in the sizing and designing of the unit 3 1 3 impact of initial dye concentration at an isothermal condition and fixed kps concentration the initial dye concentration had a pronounced effect on dye degradation fig 3 from fig 3 and it is seen that the dye concentration degradation efficiency was decreased with the increase of the initial sbb dye concentration when the other input variables were unchanged for instance at 40 c and 250 ppm kps concentration 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm and 50 ppm initial sbb dye concentrations reduced to 11 3 ppm 20 5 ppm 28 5 ppm and 37 3 ppm respectively after 120 min of operation that is 44 32 29 and 26 concentration degradation was achieved for 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm and 50 ppm initial dye concentration correspondingly fig 3a this decrease in degradation efficiency for a fixed kps concentration and temperature with increasing dye concentration might be caused by three reasons i presence of more dye substrate in the solution with an increase in dye concentration as compared to a fixed number of so4 and oh radicals 56 ii high initial dye concentration can decrease the probability of the reaction between the dye and reactive species as the number of active radical species generated is assumed constant but the decolorization efficiency decreases with the increase in molecules to be oxidized for the same operating condition 65 82 8 and iii reactive free radicals might have been consumed by the intermediates causing competitive parallel reactions of these free radicals with sbb dye and intermediates 28 42 43 a similar decreasing pattern of dye concentration was also observed for other 40 c operations for 500 ppm kps dose fig 3d and 750 ppm kps fig 3g however the decreasing pattern was different when the temperature was varied the impact of dye concentration at 50 c is shown in fig 3b e and h and at 60 c are shown in fig 3c f and i for a low concentration of kps the degradation pattern was highly dependent on initial dye concentration and higher degradation percentages were obtained at lower concentrations 20 to 30 ppm on the other hand with increasing temperature or kps concentration rapid degradation was observed for all dye concentrations for instance at 50 c and 250 ppm kps 91 degradation was achieved for 20 ppm dye which was decreased to 63 for 50 ppm dye fig 3b however the degradation was increased with an increase of kps concentration fig 3e andh a further increase in temperature to 60 c the impact of dye concentration was decreased as shown in fig 3c f and i there was no impact of dye concentration on the degradation after a specified time about 100 removal for all dye concentrations was observed after 100 min for 250 ppm kps concentration fig 3c after 40 min for 500 ppm kps concentration fig 3f and after 15 min for 750 ppm concentration fig 3i respectively these are the evidence for the minimal initial concentration dependence of dye degradation for higher kps concentration at higher temperatures the results indicate that the dye degradation was very fast at 750 ppm kps dose and 60 c as compared to other temperatures and kps doses fig 3c hossein panahi 27 observed a maximum of 75 degradation at 500 ppm persulfate concentration for real dairy wastewater and kusic et al obtained 54 degradation of reactive red 45 using chemically activated persulfate 27 36 it has shown 100 degradation of 50 ppm sbb dye at 750 ppm kps dose within 17 minutes fig 2i 3 1 4 impact of addition of potassium persulfate the consumption of oxidant is the main parameter related to the cost of any aop therefore the optimization of the amount of oxidant is essential for industrial wastewater treatment economically in this study kps was the main oxidant which produced the free radicals for dye degradation in the treatment and thus investigation of the impact of kps concentration on dye degradation at the isothermal condition and at constant initial dye concentration was assessed fig 4 the lowest dye degradation was observed for 40 c and 250 ppm kps solution for all dye concentration fig 4a d whereas the highest and the fastest dye degradation was observed for 60 c and 750 ppm kps solution for all dye concentrations as shown in fig 4a d kps solution doesn t have a pronounced impact on dye degradation because the kps at 40 c might not be active enough to generate so4 and oh radicals to decompose sbb dye effectively the maximum removal 44 of dye at this temperature was observed for 250 ppm kps concentration and 20 ppm dye concentration in contrast 750 ppm showed a better degradation efficiency fig 4i l and 100 dye removal was observed within 17 min at 60 c irrespective of dye concentration this might be an indication of faster production of a sufficient number of so4 and oh radicals from the dual impacts ie an increase of temperature and kps concentration which increased the reaction rate to a very high value instantly at 60 c and 750 ppm kps solution than other kps concentration and temperature kps concentration of 500 ppm fig 4e h also showed around 100 dye removal and can be considered as effective for the treatment of sbb dye however the reaction rate was slower than that observed for kps concentration of 750 ppm more than 96 of dye degradation was observed after 40 min of operation time which was only 13 min for 750 ppm kps concentration overall with increasing kps concentration the sbb dye degradation increased fig 4e l because kps itself reacts with dye as mentioned previously besides there is a possibility of generation of the amount of reactive so4 and oh radicals proportionally with increasing kps concentration at higher temperature as reported previously 29 these are the probable mechanisms of sluggish reaction at a lower temperature as compared to the faster reaction at a higher temperature 3 2 color removal the color degradation with time was measured in pt co units and the color change and percentage of color removal with time are shown in fig s1 and fig 5 respectively fig s1 shows the different patterns of dye color change with time at low temperature 40 c similar patterns of color change were observed for all kps concentrations fig s1a s1d and s1g 40 c and 50 c color degradation patterns were also found similar for 250 ppm fig s1a and s1b and 500 ppm kps concentration fig s1c and s1d 750 ppm 50 c and 60 c color degradation values were concave down and the rate was increasing with time fig s1h and s1i the color removal was time dependent and it was increased with the increase of time in contrast it was decreased with the increase of dye concentration for a specified temperature and a specified kps dose for instance as shown in fig 5a 250 ppm kps and at 40 c the color removal was decreased with the increase of dye concentration however it was increased with time after 120 min of operation the color degradation of 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm and 50 ppm dyes were 37 33 18 and 22 respectively a similar trend was observed for 500 ppm kps dose and 40 c fig 5d and 750 ppm kps and 40 c fig 5g this indicates that lower concentration of dye can produce higher color degradation efficiency temperature plays a key role in color removal efficiency the effect of increasing activation temperature on color removal highly notices worthy in fig 5d f where at 40 c the color removal percentage for 50 ppm dye was 13 after 120 min of treatment increased to 15 and 98 respectively at 50 c and 60 c thus the color degradation percentage is pronouncedly affected by the activation temperature also though for 40 c the kps concentration increment showed an adverse effect for elevated temperature operations it could not adversely affect the degradation for example from fig 5b e and h the final color removal percentages for 50 ppm dye were 45 250 ppm kps 75 500 ppm kps 100 750 ppm kps respectively at 50 c the reason behind this is that the elevated temperature increases the possibility of so4 generation which in turn starts the chain breakage reaction of dye degradation and color removal 55 75 74 the impact of increasing kps concentration is also clearly visible from fig 5 from fig 5g 250 ppm kps 60 c 5h 500 ppm kps 60 c and 5i 750 ppm kps 60 c the color removal percentages for 50 ppm dye were 15 72 and 100 respectively after 120 min this implies that the color removal was increased with the increase of kps doses the removal mechanisms of color are similar to dye removal which has been explained in earlier paragraphs a similar phenomenon was also observed by wang et al for the degradation of acid orange 7 71 thus the discoloration of sbb dye is dependent on all three parameters activation temperature kps concentration and initial dye concentration lower dye concentration and elevated temperatures were favorable however a higher kps dose was effective in the degradation of higher dye concentration 3 3 degradation kinetics analysis the reaction kinetics study was performed for zeroth order first order and second order processes with respect to dye concentration and fig s2 s10 show the plots the reaction rates and the regression values r2 have been summarized in table 1 from the kinetic study among the total of 36 datasets 24 showed higher values of the regression coefficient r2 for first order process therefore the reaction was considered as the first order reaction without a few exceptions most of the regression values r2 were above 0 9 which indicates a good fit a ffew trend lines i e 500 ppm kps 60 c 30 ppm and 40 ppm dye didn t fit for first order reaction the first order rate constant values ranged between 0 15 10 2 min 1 to 40 5 10 2 min 1 for 250 ppm and 500 ppm kps the first order rate constants increased with increasing temperature for instance for 250 ppm kps and 50 ppm dye first order rate constant value for 60 c was 3 40 10 2 min 1 which was 0 79 10 2 min 1 for 50 c and 0 28 10 2 min 1 for 40 c table 1 as the temperature increases the collision among the reactant molecule increases and hence the reaction becomes faster and that is why the rate constants increased with increasing the temperature in most cases at 750 ppm kps dose and at 60 c the first order rate constant values were found to be extremely higher than the other temperature values from table 1 the rate constant values for 750 ppm kps and 50 ppm dye were 24 5 10 2 min 1 60 c 3 56 10 2 min 1 50 c and 0 15 10 2 min 1 40 c here the first order rate constant at 60 c was 6 169 times higher than that of 40 c likewise this study it was found that organic compound degradation using persulfate followed a first order model 3 5 10 14 40 which was found second order kinetics by other researchers 17 2 1 the arrhenius plots for the experiments run at different kps concentrations are given in fig 6 the activation energy values found calculated from slope ea r were in a range of 73 223 kj mol 1 and the mean activation energy was 140 kj mol which indicates the temperature dependence of sbb degradation using kps was quite high at higher temperatures vibrational levels energy of the molecules increases which in turn increases in molecular collision frequency 73 which results in a higher rate of dye degradation the values of the activation energy obtained are listed in table 1 from table 1 it can be seen that the lowest activation energy was obtained for the lowest dye concentration 20 ppm indicating the dye at lower concentration would easily degrade this is because the energy barrier to overcome by the reactants was lower ahmadi et al for acid blue 92 ghauch and tuqan for bisoprolol decomposition and li et al for mdea found that degradation using heat activated persulfate requires activation energy of 17 kj mol 1 120 kj mol 1 87 kj mol 1 respectively 38 3 20 the high value of activation energy obtained from this research also indicates that degradation is definitely sensitive to temperature changes 3 4 degradation thermodynamics analysis the δh δg and δs were determined to understand the degradation favourability and possibility thermodynamically these parameters basically depict the effect of temperature on degradation the values of these parameters calculated for different experimental conditions are listed in table 2 it is evident that at 40 c the degradation of sbb using activated kps is non spontaneous because of the positive value of δg calculated in all cases except for 500 ppm kps 20 and 30 ppm dye in all the conditions at 50 c and 60 c the reaction was found to be spontaneous as the values of δg spontaneous condition ranged between 0 6 to 33 kj negative the van t hoff plot was used to calculate δh and δs and the plots for 250 ppm kps 500 ppm kps and 750 ppm kps are shown in fig s11 all the plots in fig s11 exhibited negative slopes and positive y axis intercepts indicating the equilibrium constant values were decreased with the decrease of temperature increasing 1 t therefore the degradation reaction was clearly an endothermic one as the δh values were positive for every reaction conditions calculated using the van t hoff plots the reaction enthalpy values were in the range of 190 kj mol to 505 kj mol table 2 the δs values were found to be positive in all cases indicates that the degree of disorderliness was increased and thus phase contact between the reactants increased the standard entropy values calculated for sbb dye degradation using kps ranged from 0 6 to 1 6 kj k previously ahmadi et al 3 and li et al 38 also found positive reaction values of enthalpy and entropy 4 conclusions the extent of sbb dye degradation was dependent on the reaction temperature dye concentration time and potassium persulfate dose at the highest kps dose 750 ppm and at 60 c the most rapid dye degradation was observed and 100 dye degradation was achieved within 17 min of reaction time for all the applied dye concentrations the first order kinetics was more favorable for the dye degradation and the reaction rate was 6 to 169 times higher at 60 c than 40 c the dye degradation was nonspontaneous at 40 c because of the positive values of δg which was spontaneous δg 0 6 to 33 kj at other temperatures 50 c and 60 c therefore it can be concluded that kps based aop can be applied effectively for the treatment of dye containing industrial wastewater authors contribution all authors have participated in a

13699,water soluble dyes are common persistent organic pollutants present in textile wastewater which are associated with environmental pollution and health hazards the conventional effluent treatment methods are not efficient to remove these dyes from textile wastewater heat activated persulfate based wastewater treatment is a promising advanced oxidation process aop for the treatment of textile wastewater therefore the main objective of the present work was to study the degradation of sudan black b sbb dye in aqueous solution by varying activation temperature 40 60 c kps dosage 250 750 ppm and initial dye concentration 20 50 ppm the dye degradation was found in a range of 35 100 for varied experimental conditions removal percentages were improved by the increase of temperature time and persulfate concentration but decreased with the increase of initial dye concentration the kinetic study indicated that the degradation of sbb dye using kps followed first order model with rate

pollution is one of the biggest challenges of the twenty first century according to the world bank 17 to 20 of total industrial wastewater is generated from textile industries 34 and every year around 280 000 tons of dyestuffs are discharged into water sinks through textile effluents 6 these effluents are composed of a high concentration of salts and dyestuffs intense color high chemical oxygen demand cod relatively low biological oxygen demand bod high concentration of total dissolved solids tds and suspended solids ss 12 13 literature reported that the wastewater containing azo dyestuffs is toxic and carcinogenic to humans animals and all aquatic living organisms and therefore an environment friendly innovative and efficient treatment technique is urgently required to dispose of this

successfully in the treatment of textile wastewater among them the activated persulfate oxidation potential e 2 01 v process is one of the emerging processes that can mineralize organics through so4 e 2 6 v and oh e 2 8 v 79 21 22 these radicals are created from potassium peroxymonosulfate khso5 pms potassium persulfate k2s2o8 kps or sodium persulfate na2s2o8 sps using thermal transition metal and uv activation methods 80 44 70 so4 is selective in reactions with organic compounds via electron transfer 15 16 but oh is non selective and is capable to mineralize all organic compounds 39 81 24 recently so4 has drawn attention to the removal of organic pollutants from groundwater and wastewater efficiently 23 63 72 the reasons for choosing the activated persulfate are related to high reactivity in the reaction medium stability in room temperature subtle selectivity towards any particular pollutant strong oxidation potential widespread range of reactive operation high aqueous solubility simple operating process availability and cost effectivity 35 49 60 69 the production of a highly reactive so4 and oh radicals are presented in eqns 1 5 15 16 26 1 s2o82 heat 2so4 or 2so4 2 2 so4 h2o so4 2 oh h 3 so4 oh so4 2 oh 4 2 oh h2o2 5 h2o2 2 oh from from eqn 1 it can be stated that heat assistance can break down the persulfate into so4 radicals therefore thermal activation or increasing temperature up to an optimum level can increase the reaction rate by increasing persulfate usage rate 30 47 68 however heat activation is preferred because it is an environment friendly in situ chemical oxidation process 51 30 sudan dyes are extensively used in the textile and food industries for coloring purposes and therefore a huge volume of wastewater containing sudan dyes is generated each year previously sudan black b sbb dye degradation using biological processes i e mycoflora 52 microflora 76 bacteria 77 fungus 64 have been studied moreover treatment of sudan dyes using adsorption 67 uv h2o2 11 solar uv tio2 9 electrochemical reduction 45 have been studied to the best of our knowledge no previous research has been performed on the degradation of sbb dye using activated persulfate process yet although the degradation of acid blue 92 3 naphthalene 5 methylene blue 35 ponceau 6r dye 10 sulfamethazine 14 41 trichloroethane 21 carbamazepine 22 propylparaben 32 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 7 metronidazole 53 and other dyes have been studied by the activated persulfate process therefore the main objective of the study was the assessment of the performance of activated potassium persulfate kps on sbb dye degradation in aqueous solution the impact of the activation temperature kps dosage time and dye concentration was investigated in addition degradation kinetics and thermodynamic studies including gibbs free energy activation energy and reaction entropies were also assessed the performances were assessed based on the removal of concentration and color from the dye solution 2 materials and methodology 2 1 materials the chemicals and reagents sudan black b c29h24n6 also known as ceres black bn fat black hb and solvent black 3 potassium persulfate k2s2o8 acs reagent grade 99 0 and sulfuric acid acs reagent 95 0 98 0 were purchased from sigma aldrich stock solutions of 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm 50 ppm sbb dye and 250 ppm 500 ppm 750 ppm kps were made in distilled water were preserved in a refrigerator at 4 c and used to prepare the working reaction mixtures 2 2 experimental methods oxidation reactions were conducted in 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks placing in a thermostatically controlled water bath certain volumes of sbb stock solution and kps stock solution were mixed to a predefined volume of distilled water in order to get the desired concentration of sbb dye and kps solutions for a particular experiment the effect of kps dosage temperature initial dye concentration and reaction time on the degradation of sbb dye was studied three different temperatures 40 c 50 c and 60 c three kps concentration 250 ppm 500 ppm and 750 ppm and four dye concentrations 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm and 50 ppm were used as experimental parameters here the ph was maintained at 3 by the addition of reagent grade sulfuric acid previously researchers found that a ph around 3 was optimum for dye degradation using persulfate also with increasing ph degradation efficiency decreased 78 80 the temperature was maintained by using a thermostatically controlled water bath and a thermometer was placed in each conical flask to read the temperature of the solution the reaction time was selected 120 min and samples were collected in 20 min intervals after the treatment absorbance and color of the samples were analyzed using shimadzu uv 2600 uv vis spectrophotometer and hach dr6000tm uv vis spectrophotometer respectively the absorbance was measured at a wavelength of 598 nm to determine the dye degradation as the maximum peak of sbb dye was observed at this wavelength while the color was measured in pt co unit 2 3 data analysis the removal percentage of dye and color degradations were calculated using eqn 6 7 6 dye degradation dye 0 dye dye 0 100 7 color degradation color 0 color color 0 100 where dye o and dye are the initial and final dye concentrations ppm and color o and color are the initial and final color pt co unit of dye respectively 2 4 kinetic and thermodynamic study the kinetics of the degradation of sbb dye by heat activated potassium persulfate were studied for zeroth order first order and second order process with respect to dye concentration the equations for zeroth order first order and second order models are presented by eqns 8 9 and 10 respectively 8 c 0 c k 0 t 9 ln c 0 c k 1 t 10 1 c 1 c 0 k 2 t where ca ppm and co ppm represent final and initial dye concentration and ko ppm min 1 k1 min 1 and k2 ppm 1 min 1 are zeroth first and second order rate constants respectively 66 the rate constant of the best fitted kinetic model was applied for evaluation of activation energy ea to calculate the ea j mol 1 at different experimental conditions the arrhenius equation given in eqn 11 was used 2 11 k a e e a rt here a is the arrhenius constant k is the reaction rate constant t k is the absolute temperature and r 8 314 j mol 1 k 1 is the molar gas constant this equation was applied in the ln k vs 1 t format where the slope gives the value of e a r from where activation energy ea can be calculated the thermodynamic parameters gibbs free energy δg standard entropy δ s standard reaction enthalpy δ h were evaluated using the following eqn 12 14 12 k e c ae c se 13 δg rt ln ke 14 lnk e δs r δh rt where ke is the equilibrium constant unitless cae and cse are the dye concentration degraded ppm and remained in solution ppm in equilibrium respectively for the solutions where total degradation was achieved the second last data were chosen for calculation eqn 13 is also known as the van t hoff equation 25 38 δg was calculated from eqn 13 and from the plot of ln ke vs 1 t δs and δh were determined eqn 14 3 results and discussion 3 1 dye degradation the impact of temperature initial dye concentration time and kps concentration were studied on the degradation of sbb dye the results have been discussed in the subsequent sections sequentially 3 1 1 temperature effect to study the effect of temperature on the dye degradation the initial dye concentration and kps concentration were kept fixed and the temperature was varied to observe the degradation of dye the concentrations of dye before and after treatment were measured and the results are shown in fig 1 as shown in fig 1 it can be seen that the temperature played an important role in the decomposition of dye using persulfate the degradation of the dye was increased with the increase of temperature for instance the initial dye concentration of 20 ppm was reduced to 11 3 ppm after 120 min of experimental time at 40 c fig 1a which was reduced to 0 7 ppm after 80 min of treatment at 60 c indicating the dye degrading rate was increased with the increase of temperature the percentage of dye removal for 20 ppm dye degradation is presented in fig 2 a after 80 min of treatment the dye removal at 40 c was only 37 which was increased to 97 with the increase of temperature to 60 c previously 100 degradation of the organics aniline 60 c atrazine 90 c 2 4 dichlorophenol 60 c etc was observed after 300 min 120 min and 180 min of treatment respectively using heat activated persulfate 31 33 37 49 in addition the efficiency of acid blue 92 dye degradation was increased linearly with the increase of the bond fission of o o in sps caused by an increase of temperature 58 46 which leading to the production of the active radicals so4 e 2 6 v selective and oh e 2 8 v unselective 18 therefore the possible mechanisms of increased rate of degradation of dye was observed because of the production of more so4 and oh radicals at a higher temperature accoriding to the previous studies the probable mechanisms of production of so4 and oh radicals have been presented by eqns 1 5 5 29 3 in the current study we didn t measure the so4 and oh radicals however we studied the reactions thermodynamics and kinetics the results indicated that the reactions are faster and spontaneous at higher temperature 50 and 60 c however at room temperature the reaction was a sluggish and nonspontaneous the detailed discussion has been provided in subsections 3 3 and 3 4 the 60 c temperature was high enough to degrade more than 96 of sbb dye for a specified concentration of 20 ppm dye and a constant dose 250 ppm of kps therefore further study was carried out to see the impact of temperature on other dye concentrations of 30 40 and 50 ppm and the results are shown in fig 1b d respectively the degradation trends were similar for 30 40 and 50 ppm of dye as we observed for 20 ppm fig 1a however the dye removal rates were decreased fig 2b d as compared to fig 2a indicating that the generated so4 and oh radicals might not be enough in the dye solution to degrade the dye at the increased concentration for a specified 250 ppm of kps dose fig 1e h and i l shows the results for dye degradation of 20 30 40 and 50 mg l for two other fixed dosages of kps concentrations of 500 ppm and 750 ppm respectively for both 500 ppm and 750 ppm kps concentrations the dye degrading trends were similar to the increase of temperature as we observed for kps concentration of 250 ppm for all dye concentrations the dye removal rates were increased with temperature for a fixed dye concentration for instance at a dose of 500 ppm of kps in 20 ppm dye the removal was increased from 57 to 98 for the increase of temperature from 40 to 60 c after 80 min of operation however with the increase of dye concentration the percentage removal of dye was decreased fig 2e h similar trends of dye concentration degradation and percentages removal were observed for 750 ppm kps figs 1i l and 2i l overall the dye degradation rate was increased with temperature and decreased with the increase in dye concentration however it was observed that the increase of kps concentration the degradation rate was increased and faster removal of dye was observed the impact of dye concentration and the addition of kps solution have been discussed further in the subsequent sections 3 1 2 impact of time the operating time is an influential parameter in the sizing and design of the treatment units which influence the energy cost and the investment of a wastewater treatment plant as we observed in figs 1 and 2 the effect of time on the removal efficiency had a pronounced impact on dye degradation under all the conditions the removal efficiencies of dye were increased with time the temperature kps dose and dye concentration affected the degradation time substantially for instance at 60 c 100 dye degradation time for 750 ppm kps 500 ppm kps and 250 ppm kps dose were 17 40 and 100 min respectively for 20 ppm dye treatment these results might be due to the generation of a larger amount of so4 and oh by the higher persulfate dose which accelerated the reaction rate and thus faster degradation of dye this indicates that the operation time required to attain a particular level of treatment can be reduced at a higher kps dose and therefore the designing of an experiment for optimal time can yield a better result in the sizing and designing of the unit 3 1 3 impact of initial dye concentration at an isothermal condition and fixed kps concentration the initial dye concentration had a pronounced effect on dye degradation fig 3 from fig 3 and it is seen that the dye concentration degradation efficiency was decreased with the increase of the initial sbb dye concentration when the other input variables were unchanged for instance at 40 c and 250 ppm kps concentration 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm and 50 ppm initial sbb dye concentrations reduced to 11 3 ppm 20 5 ppm 28 5 ppm and 37 3 ppm respectively after 120 min of operation that is 44 32 29 and 26 concentration degradation was achieved for 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm and 50 ppm initial dye concentration correspondingly fig 3a this decrease in degradation efficiency for a fixed kps concentration and temperature with increasing dye concentration might be caused by three reasons i presence of more dye substrate in the solution with an increase in dye concentration as compared to a fixed number of so4 and oh radicals 56 ii high initial dye concentration can decrease the probability of the reaction between the dye and reactive species as the number of active radical species generated is assumed constant but the decolorization efficiency decreases with the increase in molecules to be oxidized for the same operating condition 65 82 8 and iii reactive free radicals might have been consumed by the intermediates causing competitive parallel reactions of these free radicals with sbb dye and intermediates 28 42 43 a similar decreasing pattern of dye concentration was also observed for other 40 c operations for 500 ppm kps dose fig 3d and 750 ppm kps fig 3g however the decreasing pattern was different when the temperature was varied the impact of dye concentration at 50 c is shown in fig 3b e and h and at 60 c are shown in fig 3c f and i for a low concentration of kps the degradation pattern was highly dependent on initial dye concentration and higher degradation percentages were obtained at lower concentrations 20 to 30 ppm on the other hand with increasing temperature or kps concentration rapid degradation was observed for all dye concentrations for instance at 50 c and 250 ppm kps 91 degradation was achieved for 20 ppm dye which was decreased to 63 for 50 ppm dye fig 3b however the degradation was increased with an increase of kps concentration fig 3e andh a further increase in temperature to 60 c the impact of dye concentration was decreased as shown in fig 3c f and i there was no impact of dye concentration on the degradation after a specified time about 100 removal for all dye concentrations was observed after 100 min for 250 ppm kps concentration fig 3c after 40 min for 500 ppm kps concentration fig 3f and after 15 min for 750 ppm concentration fig 3i respectively these are the evidence for the minimal initial concentration dependence of dye degradation for higher kps concentration at higher temperatures the results indicate that the dye degradation was very fast at 750 ppm kps dose and 60 c as compared to other temperatures and kps doses fig 3c hossein panahi 27 observed a maximum of 75 degradation at 500 ppm persulfate concentration for real dairy wastewater and kusic et al obtained 54 degradation of reactive red 45 using chemically activated persulfate 27 36 it has shown 100 degradation of 50 ppm sbb dye at 750 ppm kps dose within 17 minutes fig 2i 3 1 4 impact of addition of potassium persulfate the consumption of oxidant is the main parameter related to the cost of any aop therefore the optimization of the amount of oxidant is essential for industrial wastewater treatment economically in this study kps was the main oxidant which produced the free radicals for dye degradation in the treatment and thus investigation of the impact of kps concentration on dye degradation at the isothermal condition and at constant initial dye concentration was assessed fig 4 the lowest dye degradation was observed for 40 c and 250 ppm kps solution for all dye concentration fig 4a d whereas the highest and the fastest dye degradation was observed for 60 c and 750 ppm kps solution for all dye concentrations as shown in fig 4a d kps solution doesn t have a pronounced impact on dye degradation because the kps at 40 c might not be active enough to generate so4 and oh radicals to decompose sbb dye effectively the maximum removal 44 of dye at this temperature was observed for 250 ppm kps concentration and 20 ppm dye concentration in contrast 750 ppm showed a better degradation efficiency fig 4i l and 100 dye removal was observed within 17 min at 60 c irrespective of dye concentration this might be an indication of faster production of a sufficient number of so4 and oh radicals from the dual impacts ie an increase of temperature and kps concentration which increased the reaction rate to a very high value instantly at 60 c and 750 ppm kps solution than other kps concentration and temperature kps concentration of 500 ppm fig 4e h also showed around 100 dye removal and can be considered as effective for the treatment of sbb dye however the reaction rate was slower than that observed for kps concentration of 750 ppm more than 96 of dye degradation was observed after 40 min of operation time which was only 13 min for 750 ppm kps concentration overall with increasing kps concentration the sbb dye degradation increased fig 4e l because kps itself reacts with dye as mentioned previously besides there is a possibility of generation of the amount of reactive so4 and oh radicals proportionally with increasing kps concentration at higher temperature as reported previously 29 these are the probable mechanisms of sluggish reaction at a lower temperature as compared to the faster reaction at a higher temperature 3 2 color removal the color degradation with time was measured in pt co units and the color change and percentage of color removal with time are shown in fig s1 and fig 5 respectively fig s1 shows the different patterns of dye color change with time at low temperature 40 c similar patterns of color change were observed for all kps concentrations fig s1a s1d and s1g 40 c and 50 c color degradation patterns were also found similar for 250 ppm fig s1a and s1b and 500 ppm kps concentration fig s1c and s1d 750 ppm 50 c and 60 c color degradation values were concave down and the rate was increasing with time fig s1h and s1i the color removal was time dependent and it was increased with the increase of time in contrast it was decreased with the increase of dye concentration for a specified temperature and a specified kps dose for instance as shown in fig 5a 250 ppm kps and at 40 c the color removal was decreased with the increase of dye concentration however it was increased with time after 120 min of operation the color degradation of 20 ppm 30 ppm 40 ppm and 50 ppm dyes were 37 33 18 and 22 respectively a similar trend was observed for 500 ppm kps dose and 40 c fig 5d and 750 ppm kps and 40 c fig 5g this indicates that lower concentration of dye can produce higher color degradation efficiency temperature plays a key role in color removal efficiency the effect of increasing activation temperature on color removal highly notices worthy in fig 5d f where at 40 c the color removal percentage for 50 ppm dye was 13 after 120 min of treatment increased to 15 and 98 respectively at 50 c and 60 c thus the color degradation percentage is pronouncedly affected by the activation temperature also though for 40 c the kps concentration increment showed an adverse effect for elevated temperature operations it could not adversely affect the degradation for example from fig 5b e and h the final color removal percentages for 50 ppm dye were 45 250 ppm kps 75 500 ppm kps 100 750 ppm kps respectively at 50 c the reason behind this is that the elevated temperature increases the possibility of so4 generation which in turn starts the chain breakage reaction of dye degradation and color removal 55 75 74 the impact of increasing kps concentration is also clearly visible from fig 5 from fig 5g 250 ppm kps 60 c 5h 500 ppm kps 60 c and 5i 750 ppm kps 60 c the color removal percentages for 50 ppm dye were 15 72 and 100 respectively after 120 min this implies that the color removal was increased with the increase of kps doses the removal mechanisms of color are similar to dye removal which has been explained in earlier paragraphs a similar phenomenon was also observed by wang et al for the degradation of acid orange 7 71 thus the discoloration of sbb dye is dependent on all three parameters activation temperature kps concentration and initial dye concentration lower dye concentration and elevated temperatures were favorable however a higher kps dose was effective in the degradation of higher dye concentration 3 3 degradation kinetics analysis the reaction kinetics study was performed for zeroth order first order and second order processes with respect to dye concentration and fig s2 s10 show the plots the reaction rates and the regression values r2 have been summarized in table 1 from the kinetic study among the total of 36 datasets 24 showed higher values of the regression coefficient r2 for first order process therefore the reaction was considered as the first order reaction without a few exceptions most of the regression values r2 were above 0 9 which indicates a good fit a ffew trend lines i e 500 ppm kps 60 c 30 ppm and 40 ppm dye didn t fit for first order reaction the first order rate constant values ranged between 0 15 10 2 min 1 to 40 5 10 2 min 1 for 250 ppm and 500 ppm kps the first order rate constants increased with increasing temperature for instance for 250 ppm kps and 50 ppm dye first order rate constant value for 60 c was 3 40 10 2 min 1 which was 0 79 10 2 min 1 for 50 c and 0 28 10 2 min 1 for 40 c table 1 as the temperature increases the collision among the reactant molecule increases and hence the reaction becomes faster and that is why the rate constants increased with increasing the temperature in most cases at 750 ppm kps dose and at 60 c the first order rate constant values were found to be extremely higher than the other temperature values from table 1 the rate constant values for 750 ppm kps and 50 ppm dye were 24 5 10 2 min 1 60 c 3 56 10 2 min 1 50 c and 0 15 10 2 min 1 40 c here the first order rate constant at 60 c was 6 169 times higher than that of 40 c likewise this study it was found that organic compound degradation using persulfate followed a first order model 3 5 10 14 40 which was found second order kinetics by other researchers 17 2 1 the arrhenius plots for the experiments run at different kps concentrations are given in fig 6 the activation energy values found calculated from slope ea r were in a range of 73 223 kj mol 1 and the mean activation energy was 140 kj mol which indicates the temperature dependence of sbb degradation using kps was quite high at higher temperatures vibrational levels energy of the molecules increases which in turn increases in molecular collision frequency 73 which results in a higher rate of dye degradation the values of the activation energy obtained are listed in table 1 from table 1 it can be seen that the lowest activation energy was obtained for the lowest dye concentration 20 ppm indicating the dye at lower concentration would easily degrade this is because the energy barrier to overcome by the reactants was lower ahmadi et al for acid blue 92 ghauch and tuqan for bisoprolol decomposition and li et al for mdea found that degradation using heat activated persulfate requires activation energy of 17 kj mol 1 120 kj mol 1 87 kj mol 1 respectively 38 3 20 the high value of activation energy obtained from this research also indicates that degradation is definitely sensitive to temperature changes 3 4 degradation thermodynamics analysis the δh δg and δs were determined to understand the degradation favourability and possibility thermodynamically these parameters basically depict the effect of temperature on degradation the values of these parameters calculated for different experimental conditions are listed in table 2 it is evident that at 40 c the degradation of sbb using activated kps is non spontaneous because of the positive value of δg calculated in all cases except for 500 ppm kps 20 and 30 ppm dye in all the conditions at 50 c and 60 c the reaction was found to be spontaneous as the values of δg spontaneous condition ranged between 0 6 to 33 kj negative the van t hoff plot was used to calculate δh and δs and the plots for 250 ppm kps 500 ppm kps and 750 ppm kps are shown in fig s11 all the plots in fig s11 exhibited negative slopes and positive y axis intercepts indicating the equilibrium constant values were decreased with the decrease of temperature increasing 1 t therefore the degradation reaction was clearly an endothermic one as the δh values were positive for every reaction conditions calculated using the van t hoff plots the reaction enthalpy values were in the range of 190 kj mol to 505 kj mol table 2 the δs values were found to be positive in all cases indicates that the degree of disorderliness was increased and thus phase contact between the reactants increased the standard entropy values calculated for sbb dye degradation using kps ranged from 0 6 to 1 6 kj k previously ahmadi et al 3 and li et al 38 also found positive reaction values of enthalpy and entropy 4 conclusions the extent of sbb dye degradation was dependent on the reaction temperature dye concentration time and potassium persulfate dose at the highest kps dose 750 ppm and at 60 c the most rapid dye degradation was observed and 100 dye degradation was achieved within 17 min of reaction time for all the applied dye concentrations the first order kinetics was more favorable for the dye degradation and the reaction rate was 6 to 169 times higher at 60 c than 40 c the dye degradation was nonspontaneous at 40 c because of the positive values of δg which was spontaneous δg 0 6 to 33 kj at other temperatures 50 c and 60 c therefore it can be concluded that kps based aop can be applied effectively for the treatment of dye containing industrial wastewater authors contribution all authors have participated in a
