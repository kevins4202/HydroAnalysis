22180,ship collision is one of the major contributors of maritime accidents quantitative risk analysis of such accidents is an effective tool for maritime safety administrations to understand the current risk level and propose risk mitigation measures in this paper an improved time discretized non linear velocity obstacle td nlvo algorithm is proposed to detect multiple ship encounter situations using historical ais data boolean operation on the individual nlvo is integrated with td nlvo using the union of the velocity obstacle sets to determine a dangerous encounter situation according to the pre set criteria two case studies are implemented to illustrate the capability of the proposed algorithm a comparison is conducted between the previous and the improved methods the results indicate that the improved method can effectively identify a multiple ship encounter which satisfies the pre set criteria the improved method has the potential to provide more detailed information for stakeholders e g maritime safety administration etc to propose risk mitigation measures as well as to improve the accuracy of geometric probability analysis for ship collision risk keywords risk analysis ship collision collision candidate velocity obstacle ais 1 introduction currently the world economy is closely connected to the maritime transport system with its advantages in large volume of transportation and low cost etc however ship collision as one of the major contributors to maritime accidents poses an unneglectable risk to the societies and environment in terms of its consequences of loss of human life property and environmental pollution emsa 2017 goerlandt and montewka 2014 goerlandt and montewka 2015 the occurrence of ship collision accident and its consequences may also induce unexpected impacts on the various stakeholders that participate in the complex network e g port authorities maritime safety administrations etc chen et al 2019b it is therefore important to conduct research on risk analysis and management of such accidents in order to reduce their occurrence and provide a safer environment for maritime traffic quantitative risk analysis qra is one of the most popular risk analysis and management methodologies in the maritime industry as it can provide a quantified measurement of risk and its consequences and thus facilitate decision makers to propose risk mitigation measures e g baksh et al 2018 goerlandt and montewka 2015 pedersen 1995 in maritime traffic discipline the framework proposed by fujii fujii and shiobara 1971 and macduff 1974 has gained much attention from both the academia and industry which is shown in eq 1 1 p c o l l i s i o n p g e o m e t r i c p c a u s a t i o n where probability of ship collision is estimated from two aspects 1 geometric probability also known as the number of collision candidate which is the description of the probability of ship encounters that have the potential for collision and 2 causation probability which is the description of the probability of the dangerous ship encounters that finally results in accident due to various factors e g human and mechanical failures extreme weather conditions etc the two elements jointly estimate the probability of ship collision accident from the aspects of dangerous encounters and the failure of collision avoidance due to multiple contributing factors respectively under this framework obtaining the geometric probability is the first step for collision risk analysis identification of the ship encounters that have potential of collision based on their spatial temporal proximity is the critical process for the estimation of geometric probability due to the scarce occurrence of collision accidents however it is challenging to conduct research by totally relying on historical accident records under this situation the dangerous encounters often defined as collision candidates or near misses i e the encounters that have the potential of a collision have become one of the key research interests in the field therefore the work in this research is of potential significance in geometric probability estimation to detect this type of ship encounters from historical traffic data various researches have been conducted in general these works fall within three major categories 1 synthetic indicator approach 2 safety boundary approach and 3 velocity based approach respectively according to the criteria utilized in the research to determine the encounter interested readers can refer to the literature review work by the authors chen et al 2019b for detailed information spatial and temporal proximities are the critical elements these approaches measure for synthetic indicator approaches cpa values dcpa tcpa relative speed course relative distance etc are used to measure spatial temporal proximity directly or construct mathematical models based on these indices debnath and chin 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhen et al 2017 on the other hand the safety boundary approach utilizes a pre set boundary in space to determine if the spatial temporal relationship between ships violate the pre set criteria chai et al 2017 montewka et al 2010 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 in both these approaches the spatial and temporal proximities between ships are often considered separately or combined as certain numerical values as indices to determine the collision candidate one of the critics for these approaches would be the difficulty to determine and express a physical meaning of such values in this context the velocity based approach aims to unify spatiotemporal proximity and transform the spatial temporal relationship between own ship and target ship into the velocity domain this is introduced to determine the criterion of collision risk and to measure the risk e g chen et al 2018b huang and van gelder 2019 huang et al 2018 lenart 1983 lenart 2015 etc the detection of a collision candidate or near miss situation has been well developed with the aforementioned works however there are still some issues which compromised the accuracy and reliability of the results 1 the potential of under overestimation of collision candidate due to the analysis method that only considered the data at certain time intervals 2 no consideration of multi ship encounter situations during collision candidate near miss detection for the traditional methods the collision candidate is usually identified via pairwise analysis which in practice however is not always realistic as for areas where maritime traffic is heavy and congested the encounters could be complicated in the sense that multiple ships may participate for aforementioned situations the pairwise analysis may have influence on the accuracy and reliability of the results secondly the causation risk probability risk for two ship encounter and multi ship encounter may be different in regard to their encounter complexity chen et al 2019c van westrenen and ellerbroek 2017 wen et al 2015 as in some accident the own ship intended to avoid collision with one ship ts1 but collided with the another ship ts2 without the influence of ts1 the ship might not collide with ts2 vice versa to further facilitate the development of a method for estimating the geometric probability of ship collision for multiple ship encounter situations the key research problem in this paper is to design a method that can detect multiple ship encounters that satisfy the pre set criteria of collision candidate although recently new researches have been conducted with useful insights on identifying collision candidate near miss in an area the above research problem remains to be addressed for instance fang et al 2019 improved the parameter robustness of the model proposed by zhang et al 2017 and conducted a risk analysis of collision candidate in xiamen port zhao et al 2019 conducted agent based modelling to analyse the encounter rate in the region which is similar to work done by goerlandt and kujala 2011 all these works rely on the existing methods for collision candidate detection in pairwise encounters which lack consideration of the multi encounter situation this paper presents one step forward to identify and analyse the multi ship encounters from historical ais data to further facilitate collision risk analysis in the waterways in previous work by the authors chen et al 2018b a novel collision candidate detection method following velocity based approach is proposed named as time discretized non linear velocity obstacle td nlvo where the encounter is considered as a process instead of a set of time slices allowing to reduce the possible under overestimation of the results as the successor work this research aims to propose an improved ship collision near miss detection method which can identify multiple encounter situations from the historical automatic identification system ais data based on an improved td nlvo i td nlvo to do this the combination of multiple velocity obstacle vo sets induced by different target ships is introduced the contents of this paper are as follows section 2 illustrates the framework of the method proposed this is followed by a detailed introduction to the components of the methods in section 3 a detailed introduction to the design of the algorithm is shown in section 4 section 5 is the case study to verify the efficacy of the improved method and determine whether it can identify the dangerous encounters and differentiate between single encounter and multiple encounters in section 6 a comparison between the improved algorithm and previous work is conducted followed by a detailed discussion on the combination of individual velocity obstacles the conclusions of this research are presented in section 7 2 the framework of the method when a ship navigates in the waterway she may encounter many target ships and get involved in a complicated encounter situation where the velocity of own ship has the violation of individual vo sets of multiple targets at the same time such an encounter scenario is termed as multiple ship encounter in this paper fig 1 gives the frameworks of the core algorithms in previous td nlvo and the improved method respectively in the previous work by the authors chen et al 2018b the detection of collision candidate was conducted by analyzing each pair of ships in the predefined area if a violation of the non linear velocity obstacle induced by the target ship is detected the pair of ships will be considered as a collision candidate fig 1 a however during this process situations where the own ship could encounter with many target ships was decomposed into many two ships sub situations which could result in potential overestimation of the number of collision candidate moreover for the situation where more than 3 ships are involved the computational burden will be increased due to this decomposition besides compared with the ordinary situation where only two ships are involved multiple ship encounter situation would be difficult for the decision making process of the collision avoidance of the own ship since no clear rules or regulations are adopted for such a scenario therefore it should not be considered equivalent to the simple encounter situation where only two ships are involved when modelling the risk for these situations to fulfil the goal of identifying multiple ship encounter in this paper a two step encounter situation analysis process is proposed firstly the nlvo induced by each target ship at each time spot of the own ship s trajectory is obtained with the same algorithm in the previous work secondly the individual velocity obstacles induced by target ships are integrated as a combined nlvo using the boolean operations of the polygon e g union a violation detection on the combined nlvo is then conducted if there is a violation of the combined nlvo a detailed violation analysis is conducted to identify which target ships are the contributors to the situation with this operation the multi ship encounter which satisfies the pre set criterion of collision candidate can be detected from the historical ais data 3 collision candidate detection methods to identify the dangerous encounters that have the potential for collision the indices or models that can reflect the spatial temporal proximity between ships have been widely introduced as the instruments e g cpa and its values etc however when in the application the spatial temporal proximity is often considered separately or combined as a numeric indicator which lacks physical meaning in certain situations e g when dcpa and tcpa offer contradictory results it would be difficult to determine the risk level of encounter situation velocity meanwhile is an indicator that can unify the spatial and temporal proximity in one dimension therefore in this research we utilized the velocity obstacle based approach to detect the encounters that can be considered as collision candidates 3 1 time discrete non linear velocity obstacle algorithm vo algorithm is an effective and intuitive method for collision avoidance in many disciplines e g motion planning e g fiorini and shiller 1998 autonomous ships e g zhao et al 2016 navigational assistant for the oows e g huang et al 2019b etc it describes sets of velocities where if the velocity of the chosen object e g own ship in maritime domain falls into a set a certain spatiotemporal proximity situation will happen in the future of the detection time i e the dangerous encounter can be identified with the indicator of velocity with its inherent nature that can express such spatial temporal proximity simultaneously this set is also called a vo set in chen et al 2018b the authors proposed a td nlvo algorithm to detect collision candidate using historical ais data as mentioned in section 1 the collision candidate in this case is identified from the perspective of a process rather than of certain time instances and velocity obstacle set is introduced as the criterion to determine the collision candidate the basic principle of td nlvo is shown in fig 2 suppose that ship a and b are in an encounter situation fig 2 a and their kinematic information e g position velocity heading etc are known the state of ship a and b is expressed as a l a p a t v a t and b l b p b t v b t respectively where l p t v t are the length position and velocity of each ship at time t the spatial relationships between the two ships can be transformed into the velocity domain of the own ship ship a which is shown in fig 2b the circular area in fig 2 denotes an area around the own ship where ship b could possibly be when the collision happens which is defined as confp huang et al 2018 and can be obtained according to eq 1 2 c o n f p p a t p b t r where p denotes the position of ships at time t and is the euclidean distance between them r is the pre set safety distance threshold from the perspective of the own ship eq 1 can be rewritten into eq 2 3 p a t c p b t c c o n f p where p t c is the position of ship a and b when the collision happens and is the minkowski addition considering the assumption that kinematic information of both ships is known eq 2 can be substituted with eq 3 4 vo a b t p b t p a t 0 t t 0 c o n f p t t 0 where vo a b denotes the velocity sets of the own ship induced by ship b and t 0 is the time of detection this equation is considered as the criterion of collision candidate near miss identification i e if the velocity of the own ship satisfies eq 3 the pre set spatial relationship between own ship and target ship will be satisfied if the own ship maintains her velocity 3 2 determination of multiple ship encounter situation for ships navigating in water areas with heavy maritime traffic e g busy ports and important waterways the encounter situations are complicated when multiple ships more than 2 are involved due to the fact that the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs only provides rules and guidance for collision avoidance between two ships such situations require the officers on watch oows to evaluate and prioritize the risk of collision caused by each individual encounter and propose and execute a global avoidance manoeuvre to safely pass the target ships during this process the decision making process and their room to manoeuvre is also constrained by the influence of multiple target ships which increases the risk of collision in such situation compared with the simple encounter where only 2 ships are involved to better grasp the picture of the collision risk in certain regions it is necessary to analyse the collision candidate near miss with more detail a multiple encounter situation detection procedure is proposed based on the boolean operation union on the polygons a simple illustration is shown in fig 3 suppose that ship a b and c are in an encounter situation shown in fig 3a and their kinematic information is known based on the traditional td nlvo such situation will be decomposed into two situations and be analysed separately which will result in a redundant record in the collision candidate list to solve this problem here the boolean operation on polygons is introduced the velocity obstacles of ship a induced by b and c can be merged as one as indicated by fig 3b which allows ship a to evaluate if her velocity has violated the combined nlvo the individual nlvo induced by each target ship will be utilized to determine which target ship has contributed to such violation the boolean operation on polygons is a popular technique in computational graphics and geosciences a complicated shape can be generated with multiple polygons using the boolean operation such as union combine intersect etc martínez et al 2009 in this research such a technique is introduced to perform the combination of nlvo sets with open software libraries such as polyboolcs 1 1 https github com stagpoint polyboolcs polybooljs 2 2 https github com voidqk polybooljs to do this each vo induced by the data point of a target ship is first discretized as a polygon shape of 20 points then the union operation is performed to combine the separated vos as a large area which represents the individual nlvo induced by a target ship on the basis of the individual nlvos one or multiple combined nlvo will be obtained to represent the multiple encounter situation in the velocity domain of the own ship 4 implementation of the improved td nlvo as one of the critical elements in probabilistic risk analysis of ship collision accident identification of collision candidate near miss is the first step to quantify the risk and its characteristics for that purpose the td nlvo and boolean operation on polygons are integrated into this research a modified criterion of collision candidate as shown in eq 4 is introduced as the basis of the algorithm 5 vo a j 1 n vo a s hip j t i vo a s hip j t i p s h i p j t i p a t 0 t i t 0 c o n f p s h i p j t i t 0 where vo a is the non linear velocity obstacle sets of the own ship ship a induced by the other ships in the encounter situation which is the union of all non linear velocity obstacle sets induced by each target individually t 0 is the time of detection and t i is the future time step each non linear velocity obstacle set induced by one target ship s hip j is obtained following the criterion in the previous work with the circular shape of confp in principle one can also use other shapes of criteria for collision candidate detection e g elliptical ship domain etc however since the goal of this paper is to propose the method that can detect multiple ship encounter the basic shape of the criteria is considered here it is also plausible to apply other complicated shapes of the criteria e g elliptical ship domain etc into the algorithm considering the local ship traffic characteristics when in practices to make a comparison with the previous work the parameter of the confp is indicatively set to be 500 m in the proposed method and previous td nlvo based on the criteria of eq 4 an improved td nlvo for the multi ship encounter is proposed as algorithm 1 illustrates for a three ships encounter scenario algorithm 1 ship domain based time discrete non linear velocity obstacle for multi ship encounter detection image 1 the principle of the algorithm is as follows suppose that ship a and multiple ships are in an encounter situation ship a is selected as the own ship for each data point p i of ship a s trajectory set p i t i m e as the detection time for this point all the ais data of the target ships whose time is later than p i t i m e are collected and are transformed into nlvos induced by them according to eq 4 for each target ship j each discrete confp induced by the data point in the ais data will be obtained using eq 4 and all the confp are combined as one individual nlvo using boolean operation on polygons to represent the nlvo induced by the target ship j at p i t i m e during the process the confp are firstly discretized as polygons with 20 points and then developed with the boolean operation when all the individual nlvo induced by target ships are obtained the combined nlvo which represents the multiple encounter situation at p i t i m e is obtained with the help of the union operation the velocity of own ship will be analysed to determine if there is a violation of the combined nlvo if so the time and the ship name which caused the nlvo violation will be recorded for further analysis the individual nlvo violation detection will be further performed to decompose the multi ship encounters into pairwise analysis between the own ship and each of the target ship to verify if there are multiple violations with target ships and determine the contributor to the encounter situation with such design the encounters with the participation of multiple ships more than 2 can be identified from the historical ais data to facilitate the estimation of the geometric collision probability in the waterways with more insights on the characteristics of ship encounters in the meantime the analysis of the multi ship encounter could also be beneficial for the collision avoidance of the individual ships however due to the scope of this research interested readers on such a topic please be referred to huang et al 2019b for details 5 case study in this section two case studies were performed to verify the capability of the proposed method for detecting multi ship encounter process case 1 is an encounter situation where four ships are involved and the own ship has a multiple encounter situation with two of the target ships case 2 is a more complicated encounter situation where multiple ships are involved and the own ship has vo violation processes with multiple target ships at the same time to do this historical ais data from the open access of the danish maritime authority was utilized as the test datasets the velocity information speed and course in this research utilizes the speed over ground and course over ground to represent the movements of ship in regards to the true ground coordinate system and to represent the scenario detecting the traffic situation form a third party e g msa view based on the observation of the data however to utilize the velocity based approach for individual collision avoidance on board the speed over water and heading should be used the objective of these case studies is to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm here we utilized two different sets of data for 15 min each as test data sets the description of the data sets is shown in table 1 to keep the name of the ships anonymous the middle three digits of the mmsis maritime mobile service identifier mmsi is replaced with xxx 5 1 encounter scenario 1 in this case 15 min of ais data are utilized to test the proposed method where 219xxx307 219xxx172 304xxx000 578xxx100 are the ships involved in the duration 219xxx172 was chosen as the research object own ship to apply the proposed algorithm the radius of the safety region is set as 500 m based on the results of the method a multi ship encounter between the own ship 219xxx172 and target ships 578xxx100 and 304xxx000 was detected table 2 and fig 4 illustrate the results of encounter detection and a snapshot of positions of ships combined nlvo of own ship induced by target ships and violated nlvo of the target ship from table 2 one can see that the own ship has the violation of the combined non linear velocity obstacle sets and individual violations with both two target ships within the detection time span respectively the duration of detected nlvo violation for the two ships is different and they share an overlap in time which means that during the encounter process there was a period of time the own ship has violated the individual nlvos at the same time these findings can be confirmed in fig 4 in fig 4 the positions of ships at each time step and the combined nlvo of target ships are shown in the column a and b respectively the decomposed nlvo to represent the violation of nlvo induced by each target ship are shown in column c it is clear that the combined nlvo of target ships is composed of multiple individual nlvos of each target ship from fig 5 1 b and 1 c one can see that the violated nlvo induced by ship 578xxx100 is smaller than combined nlvo and the results indicate that own ship only has violation with 578xxx100 this indicates that the nlvo of other targets is combined into the large nlvo during the boolean operation union and the velocity of own ship does not have violation with them as for fig 4 2 b and 2 c one can see clearly the combined nlvo is made by two different individual nlvos showed in 2 c and the own ship has the violation of each individual nlvos as for fig 4 3 b and 3 c one can see that the velocity space of the own ship is filled by the nlvo this indicates that the current spatial temporal proximity already satisfied the pre set criteria with this design of algorithm the collision candidate detection process can be processed in this manner firstly determine if there is a violation of combined nlvo at each step if there is a violation then determine which individual ship caused such violation with the own ship in this way a detailed analysis of the encounter process can be conducted 5 2 encounter scenario 2 in the previous section a case scenario where the own ship has velocity violation of the non linear velocity obstacle sets induced by two target ships is illustrated here a more complicated situation where multiple ships are involved in the encounter scenario is utilized to illustrate the capability of the proposed algorithm to detect multi ship encounter process the results of collision detection and a snapshot of positions of ships combined nlvo and violated individual nlvo or target ships are shown in table 3 and fig 5 respectively during the detection period 9 ships participate in navigation in the water area the own ship has violated the individual nlvos of three target ships successively as table 3 indicates one can see that during the process there are overlaps of time for the individual nlvos violation period which indicates that during such an encounter process the velocity of the own ship has violated the nlvo induced by the multiple target ships simultaneously the combined nlvo induced by the multiple target ships is decomposed and shown in the sub figures in column c of fig 5 for example during 04 45 07 to 04 50 33 the own ship and target ships 219xxx903 231xxx000 304 xxx 000 formulated a four ship encounter that satisfied the criterion of collision candidate during the encounter process this can also be proved in fig 5 from fig 5 1 b and 1 c one can see at time step 04 46 27 the velocity of own ship violated the combined nlvo and especially violated the nlvo induced by the ships 219xxx903 231xxx000 304 xxx 000 fig 5 1 c while at time step 04 53 46 one can see the velocity of own ship violated the vos of the ship 231xxx000 304 xxx 000 simultaneously fig 5 2 c at time step 04 58 18 the own ship only had velocity violation with target ship 304 xxx 000 based on the results one can see that the proposed method has successfully detected the multiple encounter situation during the encounter process the detailed record of such an encounter can be utilized for further analysis of the characteristics of each phase of the encounter e g single encounter multiple encounter single encounter etc the evolution of the encounter process in the velocity domain of own ship can be found in gif 1 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 106718 the following is the supplementary data related to this article gif 1 gif gif 1 gif 5 3 multi ship encounter detection to further verify the proposed method another data set which are ais data from 09 00 to 21 00 on oct 15th are utilized to identify the multi ship encounter situations in the area of the case study the original td nlvo are also introduced to make the comparison the detailed information and their corresponding data obtained from td nlvo are also shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively as table 4 indicates in total 6 cases of multi ship encounter situations are identified from the ais data the start and end of the detection time are also included according to the results and the aforementioned two cases of detailed illustration one can see that the proposed improved td nlvo can identify the encounter situation where multiple ships are involved besides as table 5 shows for each case of a multi ship encounter the previous method has separately determined if the encounter between two ships violate the pre set threshold to obtain the information of possible multi ship encounter additional work has to be done to search for which ships have encounter with multiple targets although such work could be conducted by searching in the results in table 5 there is a fundamental difference between the two methods within the design of the original td nlvo the multi ship encounter situation is decomposed into pairwise analysis as the other existing models for collision candidate detection do to simplify the detection process however the potential influence of other targets on the two encountered ships which can be represented in the form of a united velocity obstacle in the velocity domain of the own ship is also ignored as the method treats the encounters independently and equally the difference may not be significant on obtaining the number of collision candidate however as the framework shows in eq 1 the probability of collision also considers the causation factors which can be influenced by the complexity level of the encounter situation as shown in chen et al 2019c by considering the multi ship encounter situation and identifying them with historical ais data the information can be integrated into the causation risk modelling of collision from this perspective we think the consideration of multi ship encounter within the design of the method is an improvement for probabilistic risk modelling of ship collision 6 discussions in this section a comparison between the improved algorithm and previous td nlvo is conducted from the design of the method and comparison of results respectively besides some detailed analysis of the union of vo sets are is also illustrated 6 1 validation the essence of vo and its variations is to project the spatial temporal relationships between ships into the velocity domain of the own ship it provides a different perspective to interpret the encounter situation which does not change the nature of the encounter therefore one of the alternatives to verify the validity of the proposed method is to determine if the process of encounter also contains a period of time when the parameter such as dcpa violates the pre set threshold we utilized the traditional indicators distance to closest point of approach dcpa the relative distances and the tcpa on the two case studies to verify the validity of the proposed method the results are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively as can be seen from figs 6 and 7 all the indicators dcpa tcpa and relative distance fluctuate during the encounter process as for encounter case 1 at time step 09 46 11 the dcpa between the own ship and target ship 578xxx000 is below the threshold while the corresponding tcpa and relative distance are above the threshold these results indicate that the own ship and 578xxx000 could reach closer than threshold if they perform no avoidance manoeuvre which is in consistence with the content in fig 4 1 b and 4 1 c at time step 09 47 19 both the dcpa between own ship and target ship 578xxx000 and 304xxx000 violate the threshold while their tcpas are positive which indicate that the own ship will reach closer than threshold between both of them if they perform no avoidance manoeuvre which is also in consistence with the content in fig 4 2 b and 4 2 c as for time step 09 52 31 the dcpa tcpa and relative distance between own ship and target 304xxx000 are all below the threshold which indicate they have pass clear from each other as for the own ship and target 578xxx000 although the tcpa is negative the relative distance between them is less than 500 m which indicate they violate the pre set safety boundary which is still in consistence with the content in fig 4 3 b and 4 3 c as for encounter scenario 2 similar results can be interpreted from the figures one thing should be noted is that the indicators fluctuate significantly during the encounter process which is also presented in huang and gelder 2017 with the help of simulations as the previous research chen et al 2018b indicates that such process could be detected for multiple times if the encounter situation is analysed at certain time interval instead of the whole process fig 7 shows that although the dcpas fluctuate significantly their relative distances still smoothly reduce and then increase which indicate that the encounter belongs to one process based on the comparison between traditional indicators and improved td nlvo the validity of the proposed method is verified 6 2 comparison between the previous and the improved td nlvo in the previous work by the authors chen et al 2018b the vo sets of own ship induced by target ship at certain time step are represented as a family of discrete vos which is shown in fig 8 a this is caused by the discrete nature of historical ais data i e for each data point of target ship which is later than the detection time step a vo is calculated and is collected into the vo sets for further violation analysis the advantages of doing so are related to the simplicity of implementation however such procedure also introduced redundant calculation burden of violation detection at each time step for each discrete vo in the nlvo set it must be determined if the velocity of own ship falls into this nlvo or not one solution to this problem is to first combine the discrete vos as one united shape which is the actual nlvo of the own ship induced by the target and then utilize this combined nlvo to perform collision candidate detection e g the combined nlvo shown in fig 8 b to do this the boolean operation on the polygon in section 3 2 is introduced the advantages of such procedure are as follows 1 compared with the previous td nlvo the combined nlvo is more intuitive to understand the criterion of collision candidate 2 for each time step of detection only one determination of nlvo violation must be performed another improvement in this work is the consideration of multiple ship encounter scenarios in collision candidate detection to realize the functionality to detect the multiple ship encounter the boolean operation is utilized again to combine the vos induced by each target ships at each detection time step to make the comparison between the functionality of the core algorithm between the previous td nlvo and the improved version in this research the case 1 is processed with the td nlvo the results are shown in table 6 and fig 9 respectively one can notice in table 6 that the detection of the individual nlvos is the same as results in table 2 this is reasonable because of the same nlvo approach utilized in the two algorithms however as indicated in table 6 the td nlvo is incapable of detecting the multiple ship encounter situation due to the decomposition process as indicated in fig 9 such a design also could lead to misinterpretation e g in fig 9 ships 3 case the figure shows that there is space outside the vo that the own ship is safe to choose actually it is otherwise because one large vo is not included in the figure based on the comparison between the previous td nlvo and the improved core algorithm the advantage the improved method are as follows 1 the encounter situation is considered as a whole in the form of combined nlvo s 2 for the combined nlvo s firstly the violation of nlvo i e collision candidate can be determined secondly with the individual nlvo of each target ship the participant which contributes to such a violation their duration in detection time and other information e g ship name ship particulars etc can be furtherly obtained however there are also some disadvantages of the proposed algorithm 1 due to the union operation of individual vo induced by each data point of the target ship the estimated duration of vo violation is no longer available in this new algorithm 2 due to the computational load on the boolean operations the time of calculation is increased to a certain extent e g for current not optimized algorithm it would take hours to process the one day dataset as for point 1 since the goal of the algorithm is to detect the collision candidate and multiple ship encounter situation and such algorithm does not measure the actual distance between ships the omission of this information is acceptable as for point 2 the computational time can be improved with the trade off between the accuracy on promoting the confp with points of polygon and optimization on the efficiency of the program e g introducing a data compression algorithm such as douglas peucker algorithm to accelerate the computation speed while maintaining the accuracy of the computation 6 3 detailed analysis of the union of nlvo sets for a ship having encounters with multiple target ships each target ship will induce an individual nlvo at the detection time boolean operation among these individual nlvos is performed to obtain the combined nlvo which can reflect the encounter situation in the velocity domain of the own ship during this process multiple scenarios could happen which are illustrated in fig 10 respectively fig 10 illustrates the examples of four typical combined nlvos which are detected by the algorithm 1 one combined nlvo where the contour of it is the largest individual nlvo and other individual nlvos are absorbed within 2 one combined nlvo where the contour of it is the combination of certain individual nlvos 3 multiple combined nlvo where individual nlvos are combined into multiple groups and 4 one combined nlvo where there is one or multiple holes inside for scenario 1 2 and 3 it is easy to determine if the velocity of own ship falls into the one of combined nlvo s or not however for scenario 4 it is otherwise due to the complicated situations when individual nlvos overlapping with each other in certain cases that within the combined nlvo there will be certain regions where the velocity within the region are safe for the own ship to choose i e if the velocity of own ship falls into the hole within the combined nlvo the criterion of collision candidate will not be satisfied within the design of the algorithm every polygon generated during the boolean operation is stored separately therefore there should be a method that can avoid potential false detection in this situation we designed a criterion to avoid such false detection that only the situation where the velocity of the own ship falls into one of the combined polygons will be considered a violation of nlvo i e for velocity of own ship that falls into the combined nlvo and the hole within at the same time it will not be considered as a violation 6 4 potential for risk measurement of encounter scenarios for probabilistic risk analysis of ship collision accident identifying the encounters which have the potential for collision candidate is the first step fujii and shiobara 1971 macduff 1974 with the development of the methods for obtaining the collision candidate near miss not only the number of it its characteristics e g spatial temporal distribution composition in terms of indices such as ship type etc can be further analysed to facilitate decision making for stakeholders such as maritime safety authorities and port authorities to propose risk mitigation measures moreover the developed td nlvo method is capable for researchers to learn the time of the evasive action taken by the oow which might facilitate the researchers to analyse the distribution of time for taking evasive actions from historical ais data and detects the abnormal behaviours based on the distribution du et al 2019 with the consideration of multiple ship encounter situation during the collision candidate detection process it provides a potential to measure the risk level of each encounter using the coverage of combined vos which is similar to the idea proposed by huang et al huang and van gelder 2019 such potential can be further integrated with the analysis on causation probability of ship collision accident in the meantime there are also some factors should be considered for the application of the proposed in collision risk analysis firstly due to the diversity of the regional traffic characteristics e g density and characteristics of the waterway the criteria of collision candidate when applying the methods should consider the influence of these factors to improve the accuracy and reliability of the results one of the possible solutions to this issue would be to design a to design a flexible and fuzzy based safety boundary as the safety region i e a safety region which is based on the characteristics of the own ship e g ship type length velocity etc and the traffic characteristics e g density complexity etc of the regional traffic into consideration ship domain and its variations szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 e g fuzzy ship domain zhou and zheng 2019 quaternion ship domain wang 2010 etc can be a good starting point to conduct the research however according to the experience of the authors with more complicated shape introduced the computing burden is growing the method to accelerate the computation should also be considered to improve the efficiency of the algorithm besides although with consideration of the multi ship encounter situations into the risk analysis in waterways the deeper insights can be obtained in terms of simple and complicated encounter and information about their characteristics e g spatial temporal distribution etc within the multi ship encounter a prioritization could also be considered to extract the information on which type of behaviour in the waterways could contribute more to the risk of collision to achieve such objective some analysis of traditional indicators e g cpa can be utilized secondly for collision risk analysis in the waterways collision candidate analysis or encounter analysis is only one step towards to comprehensive risk analysis i e the analysis of this step only provides the results on which encounter have the potential for collision based on the indicators of spatial temporal proximity between ships another aspect that is the causal factors should also be considered in the analysis process to obtain the deeper insights on which encounter situation is more likely to results in an accident to achieve this goal various methods can be introduced e g fault tree analysis fta bayesian network bn hänninen 2014 and its variations e g credal network cn chen et al 2019b zhang et al 2018 can be a good starting point to integrate the information for risk analysis 6 5 application of the improved td nlvo on collision candidate detection and collision avoidance in the previous sections the core algorithm for detecting multiple ship encounter process using the improved td nlvo combined with boolean operation on polygons has been proposed the two case studies also illustrate the capability of the core algorithm and some typical situations when combining the individual nlvos are also presented the results indicate that this method is capable of detecting the multiple ship encounter and has the potential to be utilized for an estimate the geometric probability for ship collision risk analysis and provide detailed analysis on the encounters that satisfied the pre set criteria however due to the limited access of ais data in our research only the open and free access to historical ais data provided by the danish maritime authority are introduced to verify the algorithm we note that there is an area related influence on our findings due to navigational conditions which in some situations could result in different results as for the application of the improved td nlvo on estimating the number of collision candidate there are some issues that need further research 1 how to deal with the complicated situation where own ship has multiple nlvo violations with target ships at different time steps for the situation where the own ship has nlvo violation with one target ship and meanwhile another nlvo violation occurred within the duration of the previous one e g the situation demonstrated in case 2 where the own ship has multiple violations of individual nlvos at a certain period of time and the participators were dynamically varying 2 definition of collision candidate for the previous researches the collision candidate usually refers to pairs of encountered ships that satisfied the pre set criteria however such a definition would not be suitable when taking the multiple ship encounter into consideration since the goal of this paper is to propose the core algorithm for detecting the multiple ship encounters these issues will be the research questions for future work the velocity based approaches have already been applied in the collision risk analysis and collision avoidance research although which have not been formally defined as velocity obstacle based approach before fiorini and shiller 1998 e g the concept of collision threat parameter area ctpa lenart 1983 and the traffic conflict technique proposed by van westrenen et al westrenen and baldauf 2019 van westrenen and ellerbroek 2017 which are equivalent to linear velocity obstacle lvo method from these researches the capability of velocity based approach on detecting collision candidate and risk of collision is shown although the objective of this research is to propose an improved version of td nlvo for ship collision candidate detection for risk analysis in waterways the proposed methods also have the potential for application in collision avoidance for individual ship e g autonomous ship also known as maritime autonomous surface ship mass for collision avoidance of individual ships the process usually contains two steps 1 conflict detection which is to determine if the risk exists and 2 conflict resolution which is to determine the collision free solution and control the ship to safely execute the solution huang et al 2019a the proposed method together with its variations e g gvo huang et al 2019b can facilitate the officer on watch oow or the controller on mass to identify the potential risk of collision in the meantime these methods can also provide more intuitive conflict resolution proposals to the controller of the own ship to avoid the collision i e the solution can be given in the form of the desired velocity speed and course change with facilitation of considering the ship dynamic during the process as for the development of vo in this direction huang et al have conducted extensive research on application vo algorithm on collision avoidance e g huang et al 2018 2019b where the gvo is utilized to conduct the collision avoidance of autonomous ship in a cooperative multi ship situation and a solution for collision avoidance in multi ship encounter situation is proposed 1 ships broadcast their trajectory information sequentially 2 the own ship chooses collision avoidance solution and broadcast the updated trajectory 3 the next ship updates its own trajectory information based on the new inputs 4 repeat the process until all the ships find their solution chen et al 2019a also proposed a cooperative multi ship system for the urban waterway network where velocity obstacle method are utilized as a benchmark considering these developments of vo and its variations we think it is also promising to utilize vo for future collision avoidance facilitation of mass 7 conclusion analysing ship encounters and identifying collision candidates or near misses that have the potential for ship collision accident is a critical element for quantitative risk analysis of ship collision to do this various approaches have been proposed in this paper based on the previous work on time discrete nonlinear velocity obstacle td nlvo method an improved multiple ship encounter detection algorithm is proposed to overcome the discrete nature of historical automatic identification system ais data and its influence on the velocity obstacles the boolean operation on polygons is introduced to combine the non linear velocity obstacles vos induced by the target ship at each data point based on the union operation an integral nlvo for each individual target ship is generated the consideration of multiple ships when performing the detection is achieved in a similar manner with such improvement the multiple ship encounter situation can be considered as a whole instead of decomposing such situation into multiple two ship encounter scenarios two sets of ais data were utilized as test data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods the results indicate that the boolean operation on the individual nlvos has successfully combined them as a whole and the algorithm is capable of detecting the violation of the combined nlvo as well as the individual violations based on the results the multiple encounter situation is also identified a comparison between the previous td nlvo and the proposed method is conducted and it shows that the combined nlvo set is intuitive to understand and reduced the redundant calculations moreover potential scenarios of combined nlvos are illustrated and analysed a simple method to avoid potential false identification due to holes in the combined nlvo is proposed and implemented in the algorithm with this improved td nlvo the multiple ship encounters that satisfied the pre set criteria for collision candidate can be detected using the historical ais data which has the potential to be utilized for estimation of geometric probability for ship collision risk analysis however further research on determining the number of collision candidates considering the complicated multiple ship scenario should be made in the future with the improvement in this research it provides a potential for new risk measurement of encounter situations where the coverage of the combined nlvo can be utilized as an indicator huang and van gelder 2019 the proposed method provides a new perspective to consider multiple encounter situation which can provide more detailed information to the relevant stakeholders e g port authorities and maritime safety administration etc to understand the collision risk in the region and facilitate the decision making process of safety measures in the meantime to conduct a more comprehensive risk analysis of ship collision accident in the waterways the consequence aspects could also be integrated as an indicator that reflects the level of severity of the accident to do so more research on the ship structure energy of collision and etc could be utilized acknowledgement this work is supported by the china scholarship council under grant 201606950005 and the national science foundation of

22180,ship collision is one of the major contributors of maritime accidents quantitative risk analysis of such accidents is an effective tool for maritime safety administrations to understand the current risk level and propose risk mitigation measures in this paper an improved time discretized non linear velocity obstacle td nlvo algorithm is proposed to detect multiple ship encounter situations using historical ais data boolean operation on the individual nlvo is integrated with td nlvo using the union of the velocity obstacle sets to determine a dangerous encounter situation according to the pre set criteria two case studies are implemented to illustrate the capability of the proposed algorithm a comparison is conducted between the previous and the improved methods the results indicate that the improved method can effectively identify a multiple ship encounter which satisfies the pre set criteria the improved method has the potential to provide more detailed information for stakeholders e g maritime safety administration etc to propose risk mitigation measures as well as to improve the accuracy of geometric probability analysis for ship collision risk keywords risk analysis ship collision collision candidate velocity obstacle ais 1 introduction currently the world economy is closely connected to the maritime transport system with its advantages in large volume of transportation and low cost etc however ship collision as one of the major contributors to maritime accidents poses an unneglectable risk to the societies and environment in terms of its consequences of loss of human life property and environmental pollution emsa 2017 goerlandt and montewka 2014 goerlandt and montewka 2015 the occurrence of ship collision accident and its consequences may also induce unexpected impacts on the various stakeholders that participate in the complex network e g port authorities maritime safety administrations etc chen et al 2019b it is therefore important to conduct research on risk analysis and management of such accidents in order to reduce their occurrence and provide a safer environment for maritime traffic quantitative risk analysis qra is one of the most popular risk analysis and management methodologies in the maritime industry as it can provide a quantified measurement of risk and its consequences and thus facilitate decision makers to propose risk mitigation measures e g baksh et al 2018 goerlandt and montewka 2015 pedersen 1995 in maritime traffic discipline the framework proposed by fujii fujii and shiobara 1971 and macduff 1974 has gained much attention from both the academia and industry which is shown in eq 1 1 p c o l l i s i o n p g e o m e t r i c p c a u s a t i o n where probability of ship collision is estimated from two aspects 1 geometric probability also known as the number of collision candidate which is the description of the probability of ship encounters that have the potential for collision and 2 causation probability which is the description of the probability of the dangerous ship encounters that finally results in accident due to various factors e g human and mechanical failures extreme weather conditions etc the two elements jointly estimate the probability of ship collision accident from the aspects of dangerous encounters and the failure of collision avoidance due to multiple contributing factors respectively under this framework obtaining the geometric probability is the first step for collision risk analysis identification of the ship encounters that have potential of collision based on their spatial temporal proximity is the critical process for the estimation of geometric probability due to the scarce occurrence of collision accidents however it is challenging to conduct research by totally relying on historical accident records under this situation the dangerous encounters often defined as collision candidates or near misses i e the encounters that have the potential of a collision have become one of the key research interests in the field therefore the work in this research is of potential significance in geometric probability estimation to detect this type of ship encounters from historical traffic data various researches have been conducted in general these works fall within three major categories 1 synthetic indicator approach 2 safety boundary approach and 3 velocity based approach respectively according to the criteria utilized in the research to determine the encounter interested readers can refer to the literature review work by the authors chen et al 2019b for detailed information spatial and temporal proximities are the critical elements these approaches measure for synthetic indicator approaches cpa values dcpa tcpa relative speed course relative distance etc are used to measure spatial temporal proximity directly or construct mathematical models based on these indices debnath and chin 2016 zhang et al 2017 zhen et al 2017 on the other hand the safety boundary approach utilizes a pre set boundary in space to determine if the spatial temporal relationship between ships violate the pre set criteria chai et al 2017 montewka et al 2010 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 in both these approaches the spatial and temporal proximities between ships are often considered separately or combined as certain numerical values as indices to determine the collision candidate one of the critics for these approaches would be the difficulty to determine and express a physical meaning of such values in this context the velocity based approach aims to unify spatiotemporal proximity and transform the spatial temporal relationship between own ship and target ship into the velocity domain this is introduced to determine the criterion of collision risk and to measure the risk e g chen et al 2018b huang and van gelder 2019 huang et al 2018 lenart 1983 lenart 2015 etc the detection of a collision candidate or near miss situation has been well developed with the aforementioned works however there are still some issues which compromised the accuracy and reliability of the results 1 the potential of under overestimation of collision candidate due to the analysis method that only considered the data at certain time intervals 2 no consideration of multi ship encounter situations during collision candidate near miss detection for the traditional methods the collision candidate is usually identified via pairwise analysis which in practice however is not always realistic as for areas where maritime traffic is heavy and congested the encounters could be complicated in the sense that multiple ships may participate for aforementioned situations the pairwise analysis may have influence on the accuracy and reliability of the results secondly the causation risk probability risk for two ship encounter and multi ship encounter may be different in regard to their encounter complexity chen et al 2019c van westrenen and ellerbroek 2017 wen et al 2015 as in some accident the own ship intended to avoid collision with one ship ts1 but collided with the another ship ts2 without the influence of ts1 the ship might not collide with ts2 vice versa to further facilitate the development of a method for estimating the geometric probability of ship collision for multiple ship encounter situations the key research problem in this paper is to design a method that can detect multiple ship encounters that satisfy the pre set criteria of collision candidate although recently new researches have been conducted with useful insights on identifying collision candidate near miss in an area the above research problem remains to be addressed for instance fang et al 2019 improved the parameter robustness of the model proposed by zhang et al 2017 and conducted a risk analysis of collision candidate in xiamen port zhao et al 2019 conducted agent based modelling to analyse the encounter rate in the region which is similar to work done by goerlandt and kujala 2011 all these works rely on the existing methods for collision candidate detection in pairwise encounters which lack consideration of the multi encounter situation this paper presents one step forward to identify and analyse the multi ship encounters from historical ais data to further facilitate collision risk analysis in the waterways in previous work by the authors chen et al 2018b a novel collision candidate detection method following velocity based approach is proposed named as time discretized non linear velocity obstacle td nlvo where the encounter is considered as a process instead of a set of time slices allowing to reduce the possible under overestimation of the results as the successor work this research aims to propose an improved ship collision near miss detection method which can identify multiple encounter situations from the historical automatic identification system ais data based on an improved td nlvo i td nlvo to do this the combination of multiple velocity obstacle vo sets induced by different target ships is introduced the contents of this paper are as follows section 2 illustrates the framework of the method proposed this is followed by a detailed introduction to the components of the methods in section 3 a detailed introduction to the design of the algorithm is shown in section 4 section 5 is the case study to verify the efficacy of the improved method and determine whether it can identify the dangerous encounters and differentiate between single encounter and multiple encounters in section 6 a comparison between the improved algorithm and previous work is conducted followed by a detailed discussion on the combination of individual velocity obstacles the conclusions of this research are presented in section 7 2 the framework of the method when a ship navigates in the waterway she may encounter many target ships and get involved in a complicated encounter situation where the velocity of own ship has the violation of individual vo sets of multiple targets at the same time such an encounter scenario is termed as multiple ship encounter in this paper fig 1 gives the frameworks of the core algorithms in previous td nlvo and the improved method respectively in the previous work by the authors chen et al 2018b the detection of collision candidate was conducted by analyzing each pair of ships in the predefined area if a violation of the non linear velocity obstacle induced by the target ship is detected the pair of ships will be considered as a collision candidate fig 1 a however during this process situations where the own ship could encounter with many target ships was decomposed into many two ships sub situations which could result in potential overestimation of the number of collision candidate moreover for the situation where more than 3 ships are involved the computational burden will be increased due to this decomposition besides compared with the ordinary situation where only two ships are involved multiple ship encounter situation would be difficult for the decision making process of the collision avoidance of the own ship since no clear rules or regulations are adopted for such a scenario therefore it should not be considered equivalent to the simple encounter situation where only two ships are involved when modelling the risk for these situations to fulfil the goal of identifying multiple ship encounter in this paper a two step encounter situation analysis process is proposed firstly the nlvo induced by each target ship at each time spot of the own ship s trajectory is obtained with the same algorithm in the previous work secondly the individual velocity obstacles induced by target ships are integrated as a combined nlvo using the boolean operations of the polygon e g union a violation detection on the combined nlvo is then conducted if there is a violation of the combined nlvo a detailed violation analysis is conducted to identify which target ships are the contributors to the situation with this operation the multi ship encounter which satisfies the pre set criterion of collision candidate can be detected from the historical ais data 3 collision candidate detection methods to identify the dangerous encounters that have the potential for collision the indices or models that can reflect the spatial temporal proximity between ships have been widely introduced as the instruments e g cpa and its values etc however when in the application the spatial temporal proximity is often considered separately or combined as a numeric indicator which lacks physical meaning in certain situations e g when dcpa and tcpa offer contradictory results it would be difficult to determine the risk level of encounter situation velocity meanwhile is an indicator that can unify the spatial and temporal proximity in one dimension therefore in this research we utilized the velocity obstacle based approach to detect the encounters that can be considered as collision candidates 3 1 time discrete non linear velocity obstacle algorithm vo algorithm is an effective and intuitive method for collision avoidance in many disciplines e g motion planning e g fiorini and shiller 1998 autonomous ships e g zhao et al 2016 navigational assistant for the oows e g huang et al 2019b etc it describes sets of velocities where if the velocity of the chosen object e g own ship in maritime domain falls into a set a certain spatiotemporal proximity situation will happen in the future of the detection time i e the dangerous encounter can be identified with the indicator of velocity with its inherent nature that can express such spatial temporal proximity simultaneously this set is also called a vo set in chen et al 2018b the authors proposed a td nlvo algorithm to detect collision candidate using historical ais data as mentioned in section 1 the collision candidate in this case is identified from the perspective of a process rather than of certain time instances and velocity obstacle set is introduced as the criterion to determine the collision candidate the basic principle of td nlvo is shown in fig 2 suppose that ship a and b are in an encounter situation fig 2 a and their kinematic information e g position velocity heading etc are known the state of ship a and b is expressed as a l a p a t v a t and b l b p b t v b t respectively where l p t v t are the length position and velocity of each ship at time t the spatial relationships between the two ships can be transformed into the velocity domain of the own ship ship a which is shown in fig 2b the circular area in fig 2 denotes an area around the own ship where ship b could possibly be when the collision happens which is defined as confp huang et al 2018 and can be obtained according to eq 1 2 c o n f p p a t p b t r where p denotes the position of ships at time t and is the euclidean distance between them r is the pre set safety distance threshold from the perspective of the own ship eq 1 can be rewritten into eq 2 3 p a t c p b t c c o n f p where p t c is the position of ship a and b when the collision happens and is the minkowski addition considering the assumption that kinematic information of both ships is known eq 2 can be substituted with eq 3 4 vo a b t p b t p a t 0 t t 0 c o n f p t t 0 where vo a b denotes the velocity sets of the own ship induced by ship b and t 0 is the time of detection this equation is considered as the criterion of collision candidate near miss identification i e if the velocity of the own ship satisfies eq 3 the pre set spatial relationship between own ship and target ship will be satisfied if the own ship maintains her velocity 3 2 determination of multiple ship encounter situation for ships navigating in water areas with heavy maritime traffic e g busy ports and important waterways the encounter situations are complicated when multiple ships more than 2 are involved due to the fact that the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea colregs only provides rules and guidance for collision avoidance between two ships such situations require the officers on watch oows to evaluate and prioritize the risk of collision caused by each individual encounter and propose and execute a global avoidance manoeuvre to safely pass the target ships during this process the decision making process and their room to manoeuvre is also constrained by the influence of multiple target ships which increases the risk of collision in such situation compared with the simple encounter where only 2 ships are involved to better grasp the picture of the collision risk in certain regions it is necessary to analyse the collision candidate near miss with more detail a multiple encounter situation detection procedure is proposed based on the boolean operation union on the polygons a simple illustration is shown in fig 3 suppose that ship a b and c are in an encounter situation shown in fig 3a and their kinematic information is known based on the traditional td nlvo such situation will be decomposed into two situations and be analysed separately which will result in a redundant record in the collision candidate list to solve this problem here the boolean operation on polygons is introduced the velocity obstacles of ship a induced by b and c can be merged as one as indicated by fig 3b which allows ship a to evaluate if her velocity has violated the combined nlvo the individual nlvo induced by each target ship will be utilized to determine which target ship has contributed to such violation the boolean operation on polygons is a popular technique in computational graphics and geosciences a complicated shape can be generated with multiple polygons using the boolean operation such as union combine intersect etc martínez et al 2009 in this research such a technique is introduced to perform the combination of nlvo sets with open software libraries such as polyboolcs 1 1 https github com stagpoint polyboolcs polybooljs 2 2 https github com voidqk polybooljs to do this each vo induced by the data point of a target ship is first discretized as a polygon shape of 20 points then the union operation is performed to combine the separated vos as a large area which represents the individual nlvo induced by a target ship on the basis of the individual nlvos one or multiple combined nlvo will be obtained to represent the multiple encounter situation in the velocity domain of the own ship 4 implementation of the improved td nlvo as one of the critical elements in probabilistic risk analysis of ship collision accident identification of collision candidate near miss is the first step to quantify the risk and its characteristics for that purpose the td nlvo and boolean operation on polygons are integrated into this research a modified criterion of collision candidate as shown in eq 4 is introduced as the basis of the algorithm 5 vo a j 1 n vo a s hip j t i vo a s hip j t i p s h i p j t i p a t 0 t i t 0 c o n f p s h i p j t i t 0 where vo a is the non linear velocity obstacle sets of the own ship ship a induced by the other ships in the encounter situation which is the union of all non linear velocity obstacle sets induced by each target individually t 0 is the time of detection and t i is the future time step each non linear velocity obstacle set induced by one target ship s hip j is obtained following the criterion in the previous work with the circular shape of confp in principle one can also use other shapes of criteria for collision candidate detection e g elliptical ship domain etc however since the goal of this paper is to propose the method that can detect multiple ship encounter the basic shape of the criteria is considered here it is also plausible to apply other complicated shapes of the criteria e g elliptical ship domain etc into the algorithm considering the local ship traffic characteristics when in practices to make a comparison with the previous work the parameter of the confp is indicatively set to be 500 m in the proposed method and previous td nlvo based on the criteria of eq 4 an improved td nlvo for the multi ship encounter is proposed as algorithm 1 illustrates for a three ships encounter scenario algorithm 1 ship domain based time discrete non linear velocity obstacle for multi ship encounter detection image 1 the principle of the algorithm is as follows suppose that ship a and multiple ships are in an encounter situation ship a is selected as the own ship for each data point p i of ship a s trajectory set p i t i m e as the detection time for this point all the ais data of the target ships whose time is later than p i t i m e are collected and are transformed into nlvos induced by them according to eq 4 for each target ship j each discrete confp induced by the data point in the ais data will be obtained using eq 4 and all the confp are combined as one individual nlvo using boolean operation on polygons to represent the nlvo induced by the target ship j at p i t i m e during the process the confp are firstly discretized as polygons with 20 points and then developed with the boolean operation when all the individual nlvo induced by target ships are obtained the combined nlvo which represents the multiple encounter situation at p i t i m e is obtained with the help of the union operation the velocity of own ship will be analysed to determine if there is a violation of the combined nlvo if so the time and the ship name which caused the nlvo violation will be recorded for further analysis the individual nlvo violation detection will be further performed to decompose the multi ship encounters into pairwise analysis between the own ship and each of the target ship to verify if there are multiple violations with target ships and determine the contributor to the encounter situation with such design the encounters with the participation of multiple ships more than 2 can be identified from the historical ais data to facilitate the estimation of the geometric collision probability in the waterways with more insights on the characteristics of ship encounters in the meantime the analysis of the multi ship encounter could also be beneficial for the collision avoidance of the individual ships however due to the scope of this research interested readers on such a topic please be referred to huang et al 2019b for details 5 case study in this section two case studies were performed to verify the capability of the proposed method for detecting multi ship encounter process case 1 is an encounter situation where four ships are involved and the own ship has a multiple encounter situation with two of the target ships case 2 is a more complicated encounter situation where multiple ships are involved and the own ship has vo violation processes with multiple target ships at the same time to do this historical ais data from the open access of the danish maritime authority was utilized as the test datasets the velocity information speed and course in this research utilizes the speed over ground and course over ground to represent the movements of ship in regards to the true ground coordinate system and to represent the scenario detecting the traffic situation form a third party e g msa view based on the observation of the data however to utilize the velocity based approach for individual collision avoidance on board the speed over water and heading should be used the objective of these case studies is to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm here we utilized two different sets of data for 15 min each as test data sets the description of the data sets is shown in table 1 to keep the name of the ships anonymous the middle three digits of the mmsis maritime mobile service identifier mmsi is replaced with xxx 5 1 encounter scenario 1 in this case 15 min of ais data are utilized to test the proposed method where 219xxx307 219xxx172 304xxx000 578xxx100 are the ships involved in the duration 219xxx172 was chosen as the research object own ship to apply the proposed algorithm the radius of the safety region is set as 500 m based on the results of the method a multi ship encounter between the own ship 219xxx172 and target ships 578xxx100 and 304xxx000 was detected table 2 and fig 4 illustrate the results of encounter detection and a snapshot of positions of ships combined nlvo of own ship induced by target ships and violated nlvo of the target ship from table 2 one can see that the own ship has the violation of the combined non linear velocity obstacle sets and individual violations with both two target ships within the detection time span respectively the duration of detected nlvo violation for the two ships is different and they share an overlap in time which means that during the encounter process there was a period of time the own ship has violated the individual nlvos at the same time these findings can be confirmed in fig 4 in fig 4 the positions of ships at each time step and the combined nlvo of target ships are shown in the column a and b respectively the decomposed nlvo to represent the violation of nlvo induced by each target ship are shown in column c it is clear that the combined nlvo of target ships is composed of multiple individual nlvos of each target ship from fig 5 1 b and 1 c one can see that the violated nlvo induced by ship 578xxx100 is smaller than combined nlvo and the results indicate that own ship only has violation with 578xxx100 this indicates that the nlvo of other targets is combined into the large nlvo during the boolean operation union and the velocity of own ship does not have violation with them as for fig 4 2 b and 2 c one can see clearly the combined nlvo is made by two different individual nlvos showed in 2 c and the own ship has the violation of each individual nlvos as for fig 4 3 b and 3 c one can see that the velocity space of the own ship is filled by the nlvo this indicates that the current spatial temporal proximity already satisfied the pre set criteria with this design of algorithm the collision candidate detection process can be processed in this manner firstly determine if there is a violation of combined nlvo at each step if there is a violation then determine which individual ship caused such violation with the own ship in this way a detailed analysis of the encounter process can be conducted 5 2 encounter scenario 2 in the previous section a case scenario where the own ship has velocity violation of the non linear velocity obstacle sets induced by two target ships is illustrated here a more complicated situation where multiple ships are involved in the encounter scenario is utilized to illustrate the capability of the proposed algorithm to detect multi ship encounter process the results of collision detection and a snapshot of positions of ships combined nlvo and violated individual nlvo or target ships are shown in table 3 and fig 5 respectively during the detection period 9 ships participate in navigation in the water area the own ship has violated the individual nlvos of three target ships successively as table 3 indicates one can see that during the process there are overlaps of time for the individual nlvos violation period which indicates that during such an encounter process the velocity of the own ship has violated the nlvo induced by the multiple target ships simultaneously the combined nlvo induced by the multiple target ships is decomposed and shown in the sub figures in column c of fig 5 for example during 04 45 07 to 04 50 33 the own ship and target ships 219xxx903 231xxx000 304 xxx 000 formulated a four ship encounter that satisfied the criterion of collision candidate during the encounter process this can also be proved in fig 5 from fig 5 1 b and 1 c one can see at time step 04 46 27 the velocity of own ship violated the combined nlvo and especially violated the nlvo induced by the ships 219xxx903 231xxx000 304 xxx 000 fig 5 1 c while at time step 04 53 46 one can see the velocity of own ship violated the vos of the ship 231xxx000 304 xxx 000 simultaneously fig 5 2 c at time step 04 58 18 the own ship only had velocity violation with target ship 304 xxx 000 based on the results one can see that the proposed method has successfully detected the multiple encounter situation during the encounter process the detailed record of such an encounter can be utilized for further analysis of the characteristics of each phase of the encounter e g single encounter multiple encounter single encounter etc the evolution of the encounter process in the velocity domain of own ship can be found in gif 1 supplementary video related to this article can be found at https doi org 10 1016 j oceaneng 2019 106718 the following is the supplementary data related to this article gif 1 gif gif 1 gif 5 3 multi ship encounter detection to further verify the proposed method another data set which are ais data from 09 00 to 21 00 on oct 15th are utilized to identify the multi ship encounter situations in the area of the case study the original td nlvo are also introduced to make the comparison the detailed information and their corresponding data obtained from td nlvo are also shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively as table 4 indicates in total 6 cases of multi ship encounter situations are identified from the ais data the start and end of the detection time are also included according to the results and the aforementioned two cases of detailed illustration one can see that the proposed improved td nlvo can identify the encounter situation where multiple ships are involved besides as table 5 shows for each case of a multi ship encounter the previous method has separately determined if the encounter between two ships violate the pre set threshold to obtain the information of possible multi ship encounter additional work has to be done to search for which ships have encounter with multiple targets although such work could be conducted by searching in the results in table 5 there is a fundamental difference between the two methods within the design of the original td nlvo the multi ship encounter situation is decomposed into pairwise analysis as the other existing models for collision candidate detection do to simplify the detection process however the potential influence of other targets on the two encountered ships which can be represented in the form of a united velocity obstacle in the velocity domain of the own ship is also ignored as the method treats the encounters independently and equally the difference may not be significant on obtaining the number of collision candidate however as the framework shows in eq 1 the probability of collision also considers the causation factors which can be influenced by the complexity level of the encounter situation as shown in chen et al 2019c by considering the multi ship encounter situation and identifying them with historical ais data the information can be integrated into the causation risk modelling of collision from this perspective we think the consideration of multi ship encounter within the design of the method is an improvement for probabilistic risk modelling of ship collision 6 discussions in this section a comparison between the improved algorithm and previous td nlvo is conducted from the design of the method and comparison of results respectively besides some detailed analysis of the union of vo sets are is also illustrated 6 1 validation the essence of vo and its variations is to project the spatial temporal relationships between ships into the velocity domain of the own ship it provides a different perspective to interpret the encounter situation which does not change the nature of the encounter therefore one of the alternatives to verify the validity of the proposed method is to determine if the process of encounter also contains a period of time when the parameter such as dcpa violates the pre set threshold we utilized the traditional indicators distance to closest point of approach dcpa the relative distances and the tcpa on the two case studies to verify the validity of the proposed method the results are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively as can be seen from figs 6 and 7 all the indicators dcpa tcpa and relative distance fluctuate during the encounter process as for encounter case 1 at time step 09 46 11 the dcpa between the own ship and target ship 578xxx000 is below the threshold while the corresponding tcpa and relative distance are above the threshold these results indicate that the own ship and 578xxx000 could reach closer than threshold if they perform no avoidance manoeuvre which is in consistence with the content in fig 4 1 b and 4 1 c at time step 09 47 19 both the dcpa between own ship and target ship 578xxx000 and 304xxx000 violate the threshold while their tcpas are positive which indicate that the own ship will reach closer than threshold between both of them if they perform no avoidance manoeuvre which is also in consistence with the content in fig 4 2 b and 4 2 c as for time step 09 52 31 the dcpa tcpa and relative distance between own ship and target 304xxx000 are all below the threshold which indicate they have pass clear from each other as for the own ship and target 578xxx000 although the tcpa is negative the relative distance between them is less than 500 m which indicate they violate the pre set safety boundary which is still in consistence with the content in fig 4 3 b and 4 3 c as for encounter scenario 2 similar results can be interpreted from the figures one thing should be noted is that the indicators fluctuate significantly during the encounter process which is also presented in huang and gelder 2017 with the help of simulations as the previous research chen et al 2018b indicates that such process could be detected for multiple times if the encounter situation is analysed at certain time interval instead of the whole process fig 7 shows that although the dcpas fluctuate significantly their relative distances still smoothly reduce and then increase which indicate that the encounter belongs to one process based on the comparison between traditional indicators and improved td nlvo the validity of the proposed method is verified 6 2 comparison between the previous and the improved td nlvo in the previous work by the authors chen et al 2018b the vo sets of own ship induced by target ship at certain time step are represented as a family of discrete vos which is shown in fig 8 a this is caused by the discrete nature of historical ais data i e for each data point of target ship which is later than the detection time step a vo is calculated and is collected into the vo sets for further violation analysis the advantages of doing so are related to the simplicity of implementation however such procedure also introduced redundant calculation burden of violation detection at each time step for each discrete vo in the nlvo set it must be determined if the velocity of own ship falls into this nlvo or not one solution to this problem is to first combine the discrete vos as one united shape which is the actual nlvo of the own ship induced by the target and then utilize this combined nlvo to perform collision candidate detection e g the combined nlvo shown in fig 8 b to do this the boolean operation on the polygon in section 3 2 is introduced the advantages of such procedure are as follows 1 compared with the previous td nlvo the combined nlvo is more intuitive to understand the criterion of collision candidate 2 for each time step of detection only one determination of nlvo violation must be performed another improvement in this work is the consideration of multiple ship encounter scenarios in collision candidate detection to realize the functionality to detect the multiple ship encounter the boolean operation is utilized again to combine the vos induced by each target ships at each detection time step to make the comparison between the functionality of the core algorithm between the previous td nlvo and the improved version in this research the case 1 is processed with the td nlvo the results are shown in table 6 and fig 9 respectively one can notice in table 6 that the detection of the individual nlvos is the same as results in table 2 this is reasonable because of the same nlvo approach utilized in the two algorithms however as indicated in table 6 the td nlvo is incapable of detecting the multiple ship encounter situation due to the decomposition process as indicated in fig 9 such a design also could lead to misinterpretation e g in fig 9 ships 3 case the figure shows that there is space outside the vo that the own ship is safe to choose actually it is otherwise because one large vo is not included in the figure based on the comparison between the previous td nlvo and the improved core algorithm the advantage the improved method are as follows 1 the encounter situation is considered as a whole in the form of combined nlvo s 2 for the combined nlvo s firstly the violation of nlvo i e collision candidate can be determined secondly with the individual nlvo of each target ship the participant which contributes to such a violation their duration in detection time and other information e g ship name ship particulars etc can be furtherly obtained however there are also some disadvantages of the proposed algorithm 1 due to the union operation of individual vo induced by each data point of the target ship the estimated duration of vo violation is no longer available in this new algorithm 2 due to the computational load on the boolean operations the time of calculation is increased to a certain extent e g for current not optimized algorithm it would take hours to process the one day dataset as for point 1 since the goal of the algorithm is to detect the collision candidate and multiple ship encounter situation and such algorithm does not measure the actual distance between ships the omission of this information is acceptable as for point 2 the computational time can be improved with the trade off between the accuracy on promoting the confp with points of polygon and optimization on the efficiency of the program e g introducing a data compression algorithm such as douglas peucker algorithm to accelerate the computation speed while maintaining the accuracy of the computation 6 3 detailed analysis of the union of nlvo sets for a ship having encounters with multiple target ships each target ship will induce an individual nlvo at the detection time boolean operation among these individual nlvos is performed to obtain the combined nlvo which can reflect the encounter situation in the velocity domain of the own ship during this process multiple scenarios could happen which are illustrated in fig 10 respectively fig 10 illustrates the examples of four typical combined nlvos which are detected by the algorithm 1 one combined nlvo where the contour of it is the largest individual nlvo and other individual nlvos are absorbed within 2 one combined nlvo where the contour of it is the combination of certain individual nlvos 3 multiple combined nlvo where individual nlvos are combined into multiple groups and 4 one combined nlvo where there is one or multiple holes inside for scenario 1 2 and 3 it is easy to determine if the velocity of own ship falls into the one of combined nlvo s or not however for scenario 4 it is otherwise due to the complicated situations when individual nlvos overlapping with each other in certain cases that within the combined nlvo there will be certain regions where the velocity within the region are safe for the own ship to choose i e if the velocity of own ship falls into the hole within the combined nlvo the criterion of collision candidate will not be satisfied within the design of the algorithm every polygon generated during the boolean operation is stored separately therefore there should be a method that can avoid potential false detection in this situation we designed a criterion to avoid such false detection that only the situation where the velocity of the own ship falls into one of the combined polygons will be considered a violation of nlvo i e for velocity of own ship that falls into the combined nlvo and the hole within at the same time it will not be considered as a violation 6 4 potential for risk measurement of encounter scenarios for probabilistic risk analysis of ship collision accident identifying the encounters which have the potential for collision candidate is the first step fujii and shiobara 1971 macduff 1974 with the development of the methods for obtaining the collision candidate near miss not only the number of it its characteristics e g spatial temporal distribution composition in terms of indices such as ship type etc can be further analysed to facilitate decision making for stakeholders such as maritime safety authorities and port authorities to propose risk mitigation measures moreover the developed td nlvo method is capable for researchers to learn the time of the evasive action taken by the oow which might facilitate the researchers to analyse the distribution of time for taking evasive actions from historical ais data and detects the abnormal behaviours based on the distribution du et al 2019 with the consideration of multiple ship encounter situation during the collision candidate detection process it provides a potential to measure the risk level of each encounter using the coverage of combined vos which is similar to the idea proposed by huang et al huang and van gelder 2019 such potential can be further integrated with the analysis on causation probability of ship collision accident in the meantime there are also some factors should be considered for the application of the proposed in collision risk analysis firstly due to the diversity of the regional traffic characteristics e g density and characteristics of the waterway the criteria of collision candidate when applying the methods should consider the influence of these factors to improve the accuracy and reliability of the results one of the possible solutions to this issue would be to design a to design a flexible and fuzzy based safety boundary as the safety region i e a safety region which is based on the characteristics of the own ship e g ship type length velocity etc and the traffic characteristics e g density complexity etc of the regional traffic into consideration ship domain and its variations szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2016 szlapczynski and szlapczynska 2017 e g fuzzy ship domain zhou and zheng 2019 quaternion ship domain wang 2010 etc can be a good starting point to conduct the research however according to the experience of the authors with more complicated shape introduced the computing burden is growing the method to accelerate the computation should also be considered to improve the efficiency of the algorithm besides although with consideration of the multi ship encounter situations into the risk analysis in waterways the deeper insights can be obtained in terms of simple and complicated encounter and information about their characteristics e g spatial temporal distribution etc within the multi ship encounter a prioritization could also be considered to extract the information on which type of behaviour in the waterways could contribute more to the risk of collision to achieve such objective some analysis of traditional indicators e g cpa can be utilized secondly for collision risk analysis in the waterways collision candidate analysis or encounter analysis is only one step towards to comprehensive risk analysis i e the analysis of this step only provides the results on which encounter have the potential for collision based on the indicators of spatial temporal proximity between ships another aspect that is the causal factors should also be considered in the analysis process to obtain the deeper insights on which encounter situation is more likely to results in an accident to achieve this goal various methods can be introduced e g fault tree analysis fta bayesian network bn hänninen 2014 and its variations e g credal network cn chen et al 2019b zhang et al 2018 can be a good starting point to integrate the information for risk analysis 6 5 application of the improved td nlvo on collision candidate detection and collision avoidance in the previous sections the core algorithm for detecting multiple ship encounter process using the improved td nlvo combined with boolean operation on polygons has been proposed the two case studies also illustrate the capability of the core algorithm and some typical situations when combining the individual nlvos are also presented the results indicate that this method is capable of detecting the multiple ship encounter and has the potential to be utilized for an estimate the geometric probability for ship collision risk analysis and provide detailed analysis on the encounters that satisfied the pre set criteria however due to the limited access of ais data in our research only the open and free access to historical ais data provided by the danish maritime authority are introduced to verify the algorithm we note that there is an area related influence on our findings due to navigational conditions which in some situations could result in different results as for the application of the improved td nlvo on estimating the number of collision candidate there are some issues that need further research 1 how to deal with the complicated situation where own ship has multiple nlvo violations with target ships at different time steps for the situation where the own ship has nlvo violation with one target ship and meanwhile another nlvo violation occurred within the duration of the previous one e g the situation demonstrated in case 2 where the own ship has multiple violations of individual nlvos at a certain period of time and the participators were dynamically varying 2 definition of collision candidate for the previous researches the collision candidate usually refers to pairs of encountered ships that satisfied the pre set criteria however such a definition would not be suitable when taking the multiple ship encounter into consideration since the goal of this paper is to propose the core algorithm for detecting the multiple ship encounters these issues will be the research questions for future work the velocity based approaches have already been applied in the collision risk analysis and collision avoidance research although which have not been formally defined as velocity obstacle based approach before fiorini and shiller 1998 e g the concept of collision threat parameter area ctpa lenart 1983 and the traffic conflict technique proposed by van westrenen et al westrenen and baldauf 2019 van westrenen and ellerbroek 2017 which are equivalent to linear velocity obstacle lvo method from these researches the capability of velocity based approach on detecting collision candidate and risk of collision is shown although the objective of this research is to propose an improved version of td nlvo for ship collision candidate detection for risk analysis in waterways the proposed methods also have the potential for application in collision avoidance for individual ship e g autonomous ship also known as maritime autonomous surface ship mass for collision avoidance of individual ships the process usually contains two steps 1 conflict detection which is to determine if the risk exists and 2 conflict resolution which is to determine the collision free solution and control the ship to safely execute the solution huang et al 2019a the proposed method together with its variations e g gvo huang et al 2019b can facilitate the officer on watch oow or the controller on mass to identify the potential risk of collision in the meantime these methods can also provide more intuitive conflict resolution proposals to the controller of the own ship to avoid the collision i e the solution can be given in the form of the desired velocity speed and course change with facilitation of considering the ship dynamic during the process as for the development of vo in this direction huang et al have conducted extensive research on application vo algorithm on collision avoidance e g huang et al 2018 2019b where the gvo is utilized to conduct the collision avoidance of autonomous ship in a cooperative multi ship situation and a solution for collision avoidance in multi ship encounter situation is proposed 1 ships broadcast their trajectory information sequentially 2 the own ship chooses collision avoidance solution and broadcast the updated trajectory 3 the next ship updates its own trajectory information based on the new inputs 4 repeat the process until all the ships find their solution chen et al 2019a also proposed a cooperative multi ship system for the urban waterway network where velocity obstacle method are utilized as a benchmark considering these developments of vo and its variations we think it is also promising to utilize vo for future collision avoidance facilitation of mass 7 conclusion analysing ship encounters and identifying collision candidates or near misses that have the potential for ship collision accident is a critical element for quantitative risk analysis of ship collision to do this various approaches have been proposed in this paper based on the previous work on time discrete nonlinear velocity obstacle td nlvo method an improved multiple ship encounter detection algorithm is proposed to overcome the discrete nature of historical automatic identification system ais data and its influence on the velocity obstacles the boolean operation on polygons is introduced to combine the non linear velocity obstacles vos induced by the target ship at each data point based on the union operation an integral nlvo for each individual target ship is generated the consideration of multiple ships when performing the detection is achieved in a similar manner with such improvement the multiple ship encounter situation can be considered as a whole instead of decomposing such situation into multiple two ship encounter scenarios two sets of ais data were utilized as test data to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods the results indicate that the boolean operation on the individual nlvos has successfully combined them as a whole and the algorithm is capable of detecting the violation of the combined nlvo as well as the individual violations based on the results the multiple encounter situation is also identified a comparison between the previous td nlvo and the proposed method is conducted and it shows that the combined nlvo set is intuitive to understand and reduced the redundant calculations moreover potential scenarios of combined nlvos are illustrated and analysed a simple method to avoid potential false identification due to holes in the combined nlvo is proposed and implemented in the algorithm with this improved td nlvo the multiple ship encounters that satisfied the pre set criteria for collision candidate can be detected using the historical ais data which has the potential to be utilized for estimation of geometric probability for ship collision risk analysis however further research on determining the number of collision candidates considering the complicated multiple ship scenario should be made in the future with the improvement in this research it provides a potential for new risk measurement of encounter situations where the coverage of the combined nlvo can be utilized as an indicator huang and van gelder 2019 the proposed method provides a new perspective to consider multiple encounter situation which can provide more detailed information to the relevant stakeholders e g port authorities and maritime safety administration etc to understand the collision risk in the region and facilitate the decision making process of safety measures in the meantime to conduct a more comprehensive risk analysis of ship collision accident in the waterways the consequence aspects could also be integrated as an indicator that reflects the level of severity of the accident to do so more research on the ship structure energy of collision and etc could be utilized acknowledgement this work is supported by the china scholarship council under grant 201606950005 and the national science foundation of

22181,interceptor is widely adopted by planing boat but adopted by deep vee vessel rarely this study focuses on the general rules of the influence caused by interceptor on the viscous flow field around deep vee vessel a series of simplified deep vee vessels of different deadrise angles are designed and the lift force of them are calculated in the condition that six degree of freedom is constrained a set of numerical simulation scheme was established through the comparison of the numerical results and experimental data in the conditions of different mesh sizes then the viscous flow field around the deep vee vessel in the conditions of different interceptor height deadrise angles and velocities are simulated by cfd approach the results of drag lift force wave profiles and pressure distribution on the bottom and velocity distribution at the stern are analyzed according to the results the virtual length height of rooster tail flow pressure distribution on the bottom lift force coefficient were proportional to velocity and interceptor height but decreased when the deadrise angle is increased in the condition of the same velocity and interceptor height the resistance cannot be reduced by interceptor if the motion of the deep vee vessel was constrained a continuous distributed vortex was induced and another vortex of small scale was found located ahead of it in some special conditions keywords interceptor deep vee vessel viscous flow field deadrise angle vortex 1 introduction reducing ship resistance is a permanent goal for naval architects and it is an important way for energy saving compared with the effectiveness caused by ship hull optimization cheng et al 2019 some appendages are much more effective in drag reduction peláez et al 2010 stefano brizzolara 2003 was the first researcher who found that the direction of streamlines could be changed caused by an appendage called interceptor and an added lift was therefore derived in the next year an investigation indicated that the hydrodynamic performance of two mono hull ship are optimized after introducing interceptor tsai and hwang 2004 after that many researchers were attracted by interceptor and they considered it as a new way to improve hydrodynamic performance of vessels by this small appendage owing to their more convenient installation and economical feasibility compared with other appendages interceptor is considered as a useful appendage in drag reduction and motion controlling for high speed vessels until today fridman et al 2007 mansoori and fernandes 2016a ertogana et al 2017 interceptors are small appendages mounted on the vessel and it is difficult to investigate their effect by cfd approach in the past therefore nearly all researches were carried out by model test an important research is performed by sverre steen 2007 in the research a series of model tests about the effect of interceptors on prismatic planing hulls has been studied the test covers different deadrise angles different trim angles draughts and speeds as well as different interceptor heights a formula used to obtain the added lift and drag is proposed but only three parameters which are length of waterline beam and inceptor height were taken into account in the formula although some numerical calculation are adopted in the research the dominating method is still experimental approach day and cooper 2011 the variations for being functional the interceptor s effectiveness induced by form of cross section longitudinal center of gravity and inceptor s geometry are investigated by model test of three 2 8 m long prismatic hulls luca and pensa 2011 it is indicated that deadrise angle has a strong influence on interceptors effectiveness a further study by luca and pensa 2014 found that the scale effects have a significant influence on the correlation procedure to investigate the effect of automatically controlled interceptors on vertical motion reduction of the vessel a high speed planing catamaran model is tested with and without controllable aft interceptors in calm water and regular head waves karimi et al 2015 the model test suggests that application of the controlled aft interceptors can give remarkable reduction in vertical motions and acceleration model test is an important method to investigate the effect of interceptor until today avci and barlas 2019 in recent years numerical method is adopted on the investigation of the effect induced by interceptor with the development of computers rans simulation is adopted to study the effect of interceptor on longitudinal motion of planing catamarans najafi et al 2015 and the results indicate that the effect on hydrodynamic coefficients is negligible except for a few cases both cfd and experiments are used to study hydrodynamics of the interceptor on a 2 d flat plate by mansoori and fernandes 2015 and an important conclusion is the increase of pressure at the end of the flat plate was proportional to the interceptor height this conclusion is more or less the same as the one pointed out by sverre steen which is about 10 years before but both of them make sure the interceptor height is an important parameter in the meantime they pointed out a better trim control is possible within a range by introducing interceptors on fast vessels and the height of interceptor has an important effect on interceptor efficiency mansoori and fernandes 2016b from that time on some researchers investigated new types of appendages based on interceptor talaat et al 2017 mansoori and fernandes 2017 jangam et al 2018 ke wei et al 2018 and how to design a proper interceptor for a specified ship mansoori et al 2017 although the researchers are eager to design new appendages based on interceptor for motion controlling or energy saving two problems are still remaining first of all the hydrodynamic performance of high speed vessels is improved by interceptor but the variation of the flow field is not clear especially the viscous flow field around interceptor deng et al 2011a deng et al 2012 which are necessary for design the other problem is that nearly all researches on interceptor are about the induced effect on the planing boat while it necessary to be investigated for other types of vessel deep vee vessel is widely used by navies all over the world barbato s research barbato et al 2005 indicates that the hydrodynamic performance of deep vee vessels can be improved obviously by interceptor although more details are still needed in the present research a series of simplified deep vee vessels are designed both numerical and experimental methods are adopted in the conditions of different velocities interceptor height deadrise angles the hydrodynamic performance of the deep vee vessels are investigated and the viscous flow field is analyzed by numerical approach in detail the derived conclusions gave a systematical understanding of the effect induced by interceptor on deep vee vessels 2 govering equations this research adopts the reynolds average navier stokes equations rans for the simulation with following forms 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 ρ u i

respectively y k y ω represents the divergence term of k and k ω respectively g ω represents the orthogonal divergence term in order to simulate the details of the viscous flow field the distance between the first layer of grids and hull surface is set to 0 15 mm and y is about 20 in the condition that velocity is 4 0 m s 3 models and experiment most of the existed researches on the influences induced by interceptor were focused on planing boats and other types of vessels are rarely involved for the deep vee hull form is widely used it is very important to investigate the influence induced by interceptor on the hydrodynamics of deep vee vessel in this research a series of deep vee ship models with deadrise angle ranging from 0 to 20 are designed which have covered almost all the characteristics of this type of ship and the influence induced by interceptor on the viscous flow field around the vessel have been studied in order to reduce the effect of other factors a unification of the length of waterline and width for all designed ship models are performed that is the length and width are set as 3 000 m and 0 375 m respectively therefore the length width ratio l b of the serial ship models are taken as 8 and the configuration and the areas of the waterline plane for all models are the same at the same time the bottom and the sides of models are flat design and the bow of the models are the same the models have transom stern and the sides and transom plate are perpendicular to the horizontal plane the numerical and experimental models are shown in fig 1 the difference between the three models is that the deadrise angle α are 0 model 1 10 model 2 and 20 model 3 respectively and cross section is changed from deep vee type to u shaped type corresponding in order to avoid the influence of the free surface on the flow field around the interceptor and reduce the differences of displacement among the three ship models the draught at the bilge corners of the three models are all set to 0 050 m therefore due to the difference in the deadrise angle α the draft t of three models are 0 050 m model 1 0 083 m model 2 and 0 118 m model 3 respectively the cross sections of the designed models are shown in fig 2 and the main parameters of the three models are shown in table 1 as shown in table 1 l represents the length of waterline b represents the maximum width of the ship model t represents the maximum moulded depth of the hull and α represents the deadrise angle as shown in fig 2 represents the model s displacement the interceptor is fixed on the plane where the transom plate is located and perpendicular to the horizontal plane it also has the consistent width with the vessel s width and extends outwardly along the contour of the transom plate the bottom of the hull is flat plates the distance that the interceptor extends from the bottom is defined as the height of interceptor h the form and position of the interceptor are shown in fig 3 the most important effect caused by interceptor is the induced lift force as well as the modification of hull attitude and viscous flow field almost all the researches on the effect of interceptor have been carried out by free model test which possesses the advantage that the final state of the hull with interceptor can be obtained directly however due to the lackness of constraint the disadvantage of free model test is thatthe initial sinkage and trimming will be changed by the induced lift force resulting in changes of the attack angle and draught of the interceptor and then the lift force will be changed according to a new hull attitude this interaction will repeat until the equilibrium state is achieved but the attack angle and draught of the interceptor in the final equilibrium state are differed from the initial state significantly and it is not reasonable to consider the effect of interceptor as a function of the initial state in such condition therefore it is feasible to adopt the free model test when studying the hydrodynamic and attitude changes of the hull with interceptor but it not feasible when investigating the flow field by the interceptor in order to solve this problem the 6 dof is constrained both in numerical calculation and model test so that the interceptor is always in the initial state and the effect of the interceptor on the flow field could be obtained accurately in the model test see fig 4 the ship model is connected to the six component force and moment sensor directly which are fixed at the intersection of the longitudinal section the middle section and the waterline plane of the ship model to reduce the effect caused by the uncertainties the model test is performed at least two times for the same condition and an average value is obtained from the test data the sensors are connected to the trailer via a rigid connecting rod 4 mesh sensitivity analysis 4 1 verification in this research model 1 is selected to perform the investigation of mesh sensitivity the origin is selected at the intersection of the central longitudinal section the middle plane and the waterline plane of the hull the bow is directed to the negative x axis direction the y axis is directed to the starboard of the hull the z axis is opposite to the direction of gravity and the coordinate system is the right hand cartesian coordinates system as the flow field around the hull is considered symmetrical with respect to the central plane of the hull only the right half of flow field is chosen and the boundary condition of central plane is set as the symmetry plane the size of numerical domain is as follows 1 5l x 3 5l 0 y l 1l z l where l indicates the length of waterline the hull surface is set as rigid wall with no slip condition and the other boundary conditions including velocity inlet and pressure outlet the numerical flow field is discretized by structured meshes three types of mesh are generated on the hull surface of model 1 fine medium and coarse with mesh size s 3 0 mm 5 0 mm and 10 0 mm respectively and the ratios of mesh size to the length of waterline s l are 1 1000 1 600 and 1 300 the y of the mesh generated close to the bottom is taken as 20 in order to capture the flow around the interceptor and the quantities of mesh in the flow field for the three conditions are 20 25 9 54 and 4 10 million respectively for the influence of the turbulence intensity on the calculation of the force acting on high speed deep vee vessel is not remarkable the turbulence intensity adopted in the investigation is 1 the dimensions and boundary conditions of flow field as well as the mesh distribution on the hull surface and near the aft are shown in fig 5 where s represents the mesh size on the hull surface the size of the mesh generated on the hull surface is 3 0 mm the amount of mesh already reaches the maximum limit that the used computer can withstand 1 cpu pc intel core 3 10 ghz 16 gb ram and about 96 h 4 days are needed for each condition when the mesh size on the hull surface is 10 0 mm the meshes are quite sparse and a larger size of mesh will not guarantee the fitness of the meshes on the bow the convection term is calculated by the second order upwind scheme and the sst k ω model is adopted as the turbulence model the ship speed is 3 0 m s the method adopted in the investigation to calculate the free surface and the wave making by the deep vee vessel is vof method to prevent wave reflection a numerical wave beach was established at the outlet boundary of the tank waves can be damped by introducing resistance to their vertical motion the method devised by choi and yoon 2009 the coefficients of vertical force of the hull calculated in each condition are shown in table 2 where cl is the lift coefficient which is calculated using the wetted area of the hull surface and the wetted area of model 1 is 1 375 m2 the lift force is the resultant force along z direction the positive direction of the vertical force is defined along the opposite direction of gravity it can be seen that in the case that the 6 dof motion is constrained the vertical resultant force acting on the hull is an adsorption force when the speed is 3 0 m s and its direction is consistent with the direction of gravity the numerical results above are analyzed and the convergence rate r k is calculated as follow 11 r k ε 21 ε 32 where ε 21 and ε 32 are the difference between the results of fine mesh and medium mesh medium mesh and coarse mesh it can be determined that the solution above is monotonically convergent when the mesh size is reduced the first term of error expansion and its precision p k are calculated as follows 12 δ k 1 δ r e k 1 ε 21 k r k p k 1 13 p k l n ε 32 k ε 21 k l n r k and a correction factor c k is introduced to improve the accuracy 14 c k r k p k 1 r k p k e s t 1 where r k represents the mesh refinement ratio p est is the empirical constant taken as 2 c k 1 indicates that the high order term is negative while c k 1 indicates positive it only needs to analyze the first item in the error expansion for three sets of meshes correcting the equation 11 by considering the influence of the high order term the error obtained is 15 δ k 1 c k δ r e k 1 c k ε 21 k r k p k 1 equation 14 evaluates both the sign and numerical value of the error the assessment of credibility u k depends on how close c k is to 1 c k 0 341 satisfies the condition 1 c k 0 125 and 1 c k 0 25 and the credibility u k and its correction form u kc are as follows 16 u k 2 1 c k 1 δ r e c 17 u k c 1 c k δ r e c 18 s c s 1 δ k 1 according to the method above the values in table 2 are calculated and the verification results are as follows it can be seen from the results in the table that the numerical results are monotonic convergence and meet the necessary criteria 4 2 validation numerical validation is used to evaluate the uncertainty of the model primarily to estimate the sign and value of the model s own error δ s m in addition to the numerical errors experiment data errors must be considered in the analysis of error and uncertainty the validation of the calculation results is as follows 19 d δ d s δ s 20 e d s 1 δ d δ s δ d δ s m a δ s p d δ s n 1 349 where d is the experiment value δ d is the experiment error s is the simulation results δ s is the simulation error e indicates the comparison error δ s m a is the error caused by hypothesis δ s p d is the error caused by adopting empirical data validation is performed by investigation of the uncertainty u v of the results 21 u v 2 u d 2 u s n 2 10 968 2 22 u s n 2 u i 2 u k 2 10 634 23 u i s c f where u i represents the iterative uncertainty u k is the uncertainty of cfd verification cf is the maximum number of iteration steps uncertainty caused by iteration u i approximately equals to zero and the uncertainty of experiment u d 2 5 d the corrected relative error and uncertainty are as follows 24 ec d sc 25 u v c 2 u d 2 u s c n 2 u d 2 u k c 2 the results of validation are shown in table 4 the corrected result satisfies e c uv c indicating that the calculated results are validated effectively through the verification and validation above the independence of mesh have been analyzed therefore the lift of the hull at different speeds are calculated in the conditions of different mesh sizes and compared with experimental data as shown in fig 6 in the fig 6 c l is lift coefficient obtained by non dimensionalization between lift and projected total force in gravitational direction it is shown in the comparison of the lift coefficients calculated by different mesh sizes at each speed that there is no significant difference between the numerical results the results suggest that the simulation of the flow field close to the bottom is the key point to obtain an accurate vertical resultant force of the hull three sets of meshes have been generated in the condition that the y values of the grids at the bottom of the hull are kept consistent therefore even if the amount of mesh element is varied about 4 times the difference between numerical results in each condition and experimental data does not exceed 5 based on the comparison above the mesh size of s l 1 1000 s 10 0 mm is selected to generate mesh on the hull surface in this research the dimensions of the computing domain is 1 5l x 3 5l 0 y l 1l z l where l denotes the length of waterline the computational domain is discretized by multi block structured grids the y value is 20 for the grids close to the bottom considering that the size of the interceptor is too small relative to the hull in order to capture the details of the viscous flow around the interceptor accurately mesh are refined by the size of s l 1 6000 s 0 5 mm in the range of 5 l around the interceptor the amount of structured mesh is about 12 12 million supposing the flow field is symmetrical to the central plane of the hull only a half of the flow field is simulated the convection term was discretized by second order upwind scheme and a time step that equals to 0 005s was adopted the meshes in the computing domain is shown in fig 7 compared with the mesh distribution used in verification and validation the same mesh size and y value are adopted in the improved scheme which makes the numerical results possess sufficient accuracy in addition the mesh is refined in a large area covering the influenced area of the interceptor which means more details of the flow field in the local region can be obtained 4 3 influence on the wave profile the interceptor is mounted on the bottom near stern and induces an effect on the wave profile of the wake flow in fact the drag reduction caused by the interceptor is also inseparable with the improvement of the wave profile of the flow field in order to study the influence on the wave profile of the deep vee vessels the wave profiles in the conditions of different ship cross sections interceptor height and speeds are calculated four sections s1 s2 s3 and s4 in the region the dimension of which is 0 5l x 1 5l and 0 y 0 5l the transom plate is located at x 0 5l are selected and the wave profiles on those four sections are analyzed in detail section s1 is located on the symmetry plane s2 s3 and s4 are parallel to s1 with distance of 1 6l 1 3l and 1 2l respectively the position of the selected sections are shown in fig 8 with reference to the speed of the general types of deep vee vessel two velocities which are 1 5 and 4 0 m s corresponding fr number are 0 277 and 0 737 are selected comparison of the results in each condition is shown in fig 9 in the fig 9 ζ indicates wave amplitude t is the draft and the draughts of the three models are 0 050 m model 1 0 083 m model 2 and 0 118 m model 3 respectively it can be seen that remarkable influence caused by interceptor on the wave profile existed in the wake flow of deep vee vessels at the speed of fr 0 277 v 1 5 m s the difference of wave profiles between the conditions without interceptor h l 0 and with three kinds of interceptors with the height are h l 0 01 0 02 and 0 05 respectively is not obvious the difference decreases when the distance between the section and the longitudinal central plane is increased for ships of different deadrise angles the difference of wave profiles caused by the height of the interceptor is negligible at section s3 on section s4 only for the deadrise angle is α 20 the influence induced by interceptor on wake flow can be distinguished in the conditions that deadrise angle are α 0 and 10 there is basically no remarkable influence on the waveforms that is to say at fr 0 277 the dimension of the influenced domain of the wave profile does not exceed 1 3l in the direction normal to speed on section s1 the virtual length of the ship is increased by the interceptor and no significant changes in the height of the rooster tail flow which is caused by the interceptor the comparison of the wave profiles on section s1 and s2 suggests that the amplitude of the wave increases with the height of the interceptor with the same interceptor the wave amplitude decreases with the deadrise angle α when fr 0 737 v 4 0 m s the influence induced by the interceptor on the wake flow field is quite remarkable even on section s4 the differences in wave amplitude between models with different deadrise angles are still obvious which indicates that speed is an important factor affecting the influence of the interceptor on section s1 it is very clear that there is a significant increase in virtual length when the interceptor is mounted for each model the virtual length increases with the interceptor height and decreases with the deadrise angle which indicates that the effect induced by interceptor on wave profile is sensitive to the form of hull cross section for model 1 with a deadrise angle α 0 the height of rooster tail changes significantly when the height of the interceptor is varied however for model 2 and model 3 even if the height of the interceptor increases from h l 0 001 to 0 002 the height of the rooster tail flow is not changed obviously an obvious variation arises until the interceptor height is increased to h l 0 005 therefore for the model the deadrise angle of which is α 0 the height of the rooster tail flow is sensitive to the variation of the interceptor height but when the deadrise angle is α 0 the rooster tail flow is less sensitive to the interceptor height no significant variation is found when the interceptor height is in a certain range this phenomenon is completely different from the result in literature ke wei et al 2018 in which the hull s motion is not restrained the height of the rooster tail flow and the virtual length decreases with the height of interceptor as shown in fig 10 the major difference between the previously published data and the present results is free model is adopted in the previously research while captured model is adopted in the present investigation for the free model the hull will be lifted up by the force induced by the interceptor which means the draught is reduced and the length of the ship wave can be reduced for the captured model the attitude of the hull will not be changed and the effect of the interceptor can be obtained directly it can be seen that it is unreasonable to use free model when discussing the influence of the interceptor on the flow field since the state of the interceptor has changed by the variation of the hull attitude which is dramatically different from the initial state and affect the influence generally the increase in the virtual length is helpful to reduce resistance for deep vee vessels but the increase in the wave amplitude of flow field is unfavorable for ship resistance as the wave amplitude and the virtual length of wake flow are both increased when the interceptor is mounted therefore the influence induced by the interceptor on resistance of the deep vee vessels will become much more complicated the height of the interceptor used in this study already covers the range that may be applied to the full scale vessel therefore qualitative conclusions can be obtained by analysis the resistance of the ship the calculated speeds are 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 4 0 m s and the corresponding fr numbers are 0 092 0 184 0 277 0 369 0 461 0 553 0 645 and 0 737 the results of the resistance of the three models with different interceptors are shown below in fig 11 ct represents the drag coefficient which is calculated using the wet area of the hull surface and the wet areas of model 1 to model 3 are 1 375 1 401 and 1 460 m2 respectively it can be seen that no matter of the deadrise angle and the height of the interceptor are the resistance coefficients of the constrained models possess the same trend compared with the results which has no interceptor however with interceptor the hull resistance is greater than that without interceptor in other literatures the drag of deep vee vessels whose 6 dof motion isn t constrained can be reduced with a reasonable height of the interceptor ke wei et al 2018 barbato et al 2005 therefore for the deep vee vessels although the interceptor has a certain influence on the waveform of wake flow field such as increasing the virtual length without remarkable increasing the height of the rooster tail flow the deep vee vessels with the interceptor mainly achieves drag reduction by modifying the attitude of the hull if the motion of the hull is constrained the resistance cannot be reduced only by the optimization of the wave profiles 4 4 influence on the pressure distribution on the bottom the influence of the interceptor on the flow field of deep vee vessel is not only on the wave profiles but also on the pressure field around the hull especially the pressure distribution on the bottom of the hull most of the researches have only found that the lift force of the hull can be increased by the interceptor some studies also found that the pressure in front of the interceptor is increased but there is no detailed conclusions on the variation of pressure distribution on the bottom of the hull caused by the interceptor and no related research on deep vee vessels therefore in order to obtain the general rules and details of the pressure distribution variation caused by the interceptor the pressure distribution on the bottom of the three designed models with different speeds and interceptor heights are analyzed the velocities adopted in the calculation are fr 0 092 v 0 5 m s fr 0 277 v 1 5 m s and fr 0 737 v 4 0 m s the extent of the area in which the pressure distribution is analyzed is 1 2 l in front of the interceptor as shown in fig 12 a the pressure distribution on the bottom in each case is compared as shown in fig 12 b d in fig 12 the bow is heading left and the pressure is the relative total pressure in the case of fr 0 092 v 0 5 m s and without the interceptor as well as the deadrise angle of which is α 0 the rule of the pressure distribution on the bottom of model 1 is quite clear the high pressure area is located in the front and middle of the selected region and the pressure gradually decreases towards the stern for model 2 and 3 the deadrise angles of which are α 10 and α 20 in the condition of without interceptor although the pressure distribution is more uniform due to the increase of draught the pressure still gradually decreases toward the stern when the interceptor is installed a significant change of pressure distribution occurs a high pressure zone is formed in front of the interceptor and the maximum pressure is greater than that without the interceptor in the same condition the extent of the high pressure area increased with the interceptor height increases at the same speed this phenomenon is consistent with mansoori and fernandes 2016b and the results in mansoori and fernandes 2016b are shown in fig 13 when the speed is fr 0 277 v 1 5 m s and without the interceptor the phenomenon that the high pressure zone is located in the front and middle of the region while decreasing toward the stern is clear with interceptor a strip shaped high pressure zone is formed in the front of the interceptor for model 1 the deadrise angle of which is 0 for model 2 and 3 it is difficult to generate a strip shaped high pressure zone due to the presence of the deadrise angle a triangular high pressure zone is formed in front of the interceptor and the pressure at the sides of the area is decreased rapidly the pressure and the area of high pressure zone is increased with the interceptor height when the speed is fr 0 737 v 4 0 m s the pressure and area of strip shaped high pressure zone on the bottom of model 1 and the triangular high pressure zone on the bottom of model 2 and model 3 are further increased therefore it can be confirmed that speed is an important factor affecting the effect of the interceptor at the same time the increase of the interceptor height will result in a rapid increase in the extent of the high pressure zone it is found that the pressure distribution on the bottom of the hull has been completely changed by the interceptor but the influence of the interceptor on the total lift force is still unknown therefore the lift coefficients of the three models without and with different interceptors are calculated and the speeds are 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 4 0 m s the corresponded fr numbers are 0 092 0 184 0 277 0 3 69 0 461 0 553 0 645 and 0 737 the results are compared as shown in fig 14 the projected areas used to non dimensionalize the total lift force of three models are the same which is 1 068 m2 the positive direction of the lift is defined as the opposite direction of gravity and the negative value in fig 14 indicates that the hull is subjected to the fluid force along the direction of the gravity when the 6 dof motion of the hull is constrained when the ship is without the interceptor the vertical resultant force decrease with the speed and increase with the deadrise angle when the ship hull is with the interceptor the resultant lift force is improved significantly it is demonstrated in fig 14 that the lift force induced by the interceptor is increased with the speed and the interceptor height for each designed model meanwhile the lift force is decrease with the increase of deadrise angle at the same velocity it is observed that not only the pressure distribution on the bottom is modified by the interceptor but also the resultant lift force is increased obviously which is an important factor for hull attitude in addition there is a linear relationship between the lift coefficient and fr number as well as the interceptor height when fr 0 2 in order to determine the extent of the high pressure area 436 pressure monitoring points were set on the bottom from the midship section to the interceptor on the central longitudinal plane and the variation of the pressure at the monitoring points were compared in each case the pressure comparison at the monitoring points for the three models with different interceptors at speeds of fr 0 092 0 277 and 0 737 v 0 5 1 5 and 4 0 m s are shown in fig 15 in fig 15 the origin of the abscissa is set at the midship cross section and p is the relative pressure consistent with that in fig 12 as can be seen without the interceptor the relative pressure is decreasing rapidly toward the stern due to fluid separation the extent of the pressure decaying zone generated is about 10 l in front of the stern and it is insusceptible to the speed and deadrise angle but the rate of pressure decay is increased with the speed and deadrise angle with interceptor the pressure distribution on the bottom is changed completely and the pressure decaying zone close to the stern is eliminated completely at the same time the relative pressure gradually increases towards the stern until a maximum pressure is reached in front of the interceptor that is a high pressure zone is formed in front of the interceptor it is interesting that as the height of the interceptor increases the maximum pressure in the high pressure zone is not located on the interceptor but at the vicinity of the interceptor this phenomenon was found in this research when the mesh size of s l 1 6000 was adopted to refine the area of 5 l in front and back of the interceptor which has not been found in the other literatures as can be seen from the figure the extent of the high pressure zone is insusceptible to the speed and interceptor height for model 1 with a deadrise angle of α 0 the maximum pressure induced by the interceptor with a height of h 15 mm in the condition that velocity is v 4 0 m s fr 0 737 is about 10 times of the pressure outside the high pressure zone but for model 3 in the same condition the maximum pressure is about 4 times of the one outside the zone therefore in the condition of the same speed and interceptor height it is indicated that the pressure in front of the interceptor is reduced by the deadrise angle i e the lift is reduced which is consistent with the conclusion in fig 14 5 influence on the velocity distribution from the previous analysis it is found that the pressure decaying zone close to the stern is changed to high pressure zone in front of the interceptor the extent of which is about 10 l and a nonlinear increase of pressure is caused which result in a maximum value of pressure in the zone but the extent of the region in which pressure is increased significantly is about 1 25 l 45 0 mm in front of the interceptor a detailed study on the flow field in this sub region is carried out to analyze such nonlinear phenomenon in which five parallel sections were set in the vicinity of the stern the length and height of these sections are 0 09 m and 0 11 m covering the area where the pressure changes nonlinearly these sections are parallel to the central longitudinal plane and the distance between the two adjacent sections is 1 8b where b is the width of the ship and p1 section is located on the central longitudinal section the sections are shown in fig 16 longitudinal velocity distributions on the selected sections of three models with different interceptors in the conditions of different velocities which are v 0 5 m s v 1 5 m s and v 4 0 m s fr is 0 092 0 277 and 0 737 are shown in fig 17 the velocity demonstrated in fig 17 is the component along longitudinal direction it can be observed that without the interceptor h l 0 the velocity is uniform distributed on all the sections for each model at the three speeds when the interceptor was installed the influence on the flow field is significant even at the lower speed fr 0 092 it can be seen that the velocity is reduced significantly in the area in front of the interceptor and this phenomenon is remarkable when the speed and the height of the interceptor is increased in the condition of fr 0 737 and the height of the interceptor is h l 0 005 an approximate triangular area is formed on the bottom of the hull in front of the interceptor in this area not only the velocity is decayed significantly but also a reverse flow is generated in the condition that deadrise angle α 0 the effect of the interceptor on decaying the flow velocity is reduced from p1 to p5 section i e to the sides of the hull and is influenced by the deadrise angle for model 1 with deadrise angle α 0 fr 0 737 and h l 0 the velocity distribution is not varied obviously from p1 to p5 section however for model 3 with α 20 there is a significant difference in the velocity distribution between the p1 and p5 sections the phenomenon coincides with the pressure distribution on the bottom of the hull in the previous part that is the high pressure generated in front of the interceptor of model 2 and model 3 is reduced rapidly in addition at the high speed of fr 0 737 it can be found that the extent of the influenced area of the interceptor in the longitudinal direction is larger than that in the direction of depth in order to analysis this phenomenon the flow field around the interceptor on the central longitudinal plane of model 1 are compared in the conditions of fr 0 092 0 277 and 0 737 v 0 5 m s v 1 5 m s and v 4 0 m s and the flow details are shown in fig 18 it is demonstrated in the figure that a vortex is generated in front of the interceptor at any speed as long as the interceptor is mounted and the streamlines around the vortexes are deflected and bypass the vortex this phenomenon is consistent with the phenomenon obtained in the literature mansoori and fernandes 2015 completely that is shown in fig 19 but much more details about the flow field is offered in the present paper it can be seen from fig 18 that the vortex is oblate which is different from the results in fig 19 the dimension of the vortex is related to the height of the interceptor significantly but little of the speed the vertical dimension of the vortex is about 2 3 of the height of the interceptor while the horizontal scale is about 1 times of it due to the existence of the vortex the streamline is forced to bypass and a vertical velocity component is generated combined with the velocity distribution shown in fig 17 it is indicated that a strip shaped vortexes which is continuous distributed along the width of the interceptor is formed in front of the interceptor the maximum vortex intensity is obtained on the central longitudinal plane and the intensity is decreased towards both sides due to the influence of the external flow field the width of the interceptor adopted in this study equals to the width of the hull therefore the vortex possesses the maximum intensity on the central longitudinal plane in front of the interceptor and decaying towards the sides of the hull rapidly in addition in the case of high speed and larger interceptor height it can be found that a smaller vortex is derived in front of the strip shaped vortexes the dimension of which is about 1 10 of the larger vortex in front of the interceptor the smaller vortex and the larger vortex formed a tandem vortex of various scales attaching on the bottom which leads to an enlargement of the extent of the influenced area induced by the interceptor along the direction of the ship length due to the limits of computer used in this research it is difficult to simulate the flow field around the hull with a finer grids therefore the existence of the tandem vortices can only be found in the condition of high speed and high interceptor height in the present paper in the further study an interesting research whether or not a series of vortices of decreasing scales will be found in the affected area in front of the interceptor when the speed is not zero can be performed the influence induced by the interceptor can be regarded as an integral of the influence caused by the serial vortices which is helpful to the researches investigating the viscous flow field around interceptor by potential method 6 conclusions in this research a series of simplified models of deep vee vessels were designed in the study numerical calculation and experimental research were carried out the wave profiles of wake flow the hull resistance the pressure distribution on the bottom and the central longitudinal section the total lift as well as the velocity distribution and streamline around the interceptor were analyzed and compared between the serial models the 6 dof motion of which are constrained in the conditions of different interceptor heights speed and deadrise angles the following conclusions were obtained a the effect induced by the interceptor on the aft flow field is mainly concentrated on the virtual length and the height of rooster tail flow in the case of restraining the 6 dof motion of the hull the virtual length increases with the speed of the ship and the height of the interceptor at the same speed the height of rooster tail flow is sensitive to the height of interceptor when the deadrise angle is 0 but the sensitivity become weak when the deadrise angle α 0 b for deep vee vessels drag reduction induced by the interceptor is mainly achieved by changing the attitude of the hull in the case of restraining the 6 dof motion of the hull even if the wave profiles of the wake flow is optimized it is still difficult to reduce the drag c with the interceptor the pressure distribution on the bottom of the deep vee vessel has changed significantly a high pressure zone in the area the extent of which is about 10 l in front of the interceptor was formed the pressure in the middle of the region is higher and is decayed towards the sides and it increases rapidly with the speed and the height of the interceptor in the case of fr 0 2 the lift coefficient induced by the interceptor is approximate a linear relationship with both the fr number and the interceptor height when the speed and the interceptor height are the same the lift induced by the interceptor decreases as the deadrise angle is increasing d a continuous distributed vortices is induced by the interceptor in front of it the shape of the cross section of the vortex is oblate the vertical dimension of the vortex is about 2 3 times of the interceptor height and the horizontal dimension is about 1 time the vortex intensity is decayed from the middle of the interceptor to its sides and its decaying ratio is increased with the speed and the deadrise angle in the cases of higher speed and larger interceptor height a small scale vortex is formed in front of the larger vortex induced and formed tandem vortices the general rule of the influence induced by the interceptor on the viscous flow field of the deep vee vessel is given in this research the obtained conclusions are helpful for the designing of the interceptor of deep vee vessel and simulating the flow field which is of viscous effect by potential method acknowledgements these financial support has been provided by the national natural science foundation of china grant

22181,interceptor is widely adopted by planing boat but adopted by deep vee vessel rarely this study focuses on the general rules of the influence caused by interceptor on the viscous flow field around deep vee vessel a series of simplified deep vee vessels of different deadrise angles are designed and the lift force of them are calculated in the condition that six degree of freedom is constrained a set of numerical simulation scheme was established through the comparison of the numerical results and experimental data in the conditions of different mesh sizes then the viscous flow field around the deep vee vessel in the conditions of different interceptor height deadrise angles and velocities are simulated by cfd approach the results of drag lift force wave profiles and pressure distribution on the bottom and velocity distribution at the stern are analyzed according to the results the virtual length height of rooster tail flow pressure distribution on the bottom lift force coefficient were proportional to velocity and interceptor height but decreased when the deadrise angle is increased in the condition of the same velocity and interceptor height the resistance cannot be reduced by interceptor if the motion of the deep vee vessel was constrained a continuous distributed vortex was induced and another vortex of small scale was found located ahead of it in some special conditions keywords interceptor deep vee vessel viscous flow field deadrise angle vortex 1 introduction reducing ship resistance is a permanent goal for naval architects and it is an important way for energy saving compared with the effectiveness caused by ship hull optimization cheng et al 2019 some appendages are much more effective in drag reduction peláez et al 2010 stefano brizzolara 2003 was the first researcher who found that the direction of streamlines could be changed caused by an appendage called interceptor and an added lift was therefore derived in the next year an investigation indicated that the hydrodynamic performance of two mono hull ship are optimized after introducing interceptor tsai and hwang 2004 after that many researchers were attracted by interceptor and they considered it as a new way to improve hydrodynamic performance of vessels by this small appendage owing to their more convenient installation and economical feasibility compared with other appendages interceptor is considered as a useful appendage in drag reduction and motion controlling for high speed vessels until today fridman et al 2007 mansoori and fernandes 2016a ertogana et al 2017 interceptors are small appendages mounted on the vessel and it is difficult to investigate their effect by cfd approach in the past therefore nearly all researches were carried out by model test an important research is performed by sverre steen 2007 in the research a series of model tests about the effect of interceptors on prismatic planing hulls has been studied the test covers different deadrise angles different trim angles draughts and speeds as well as different interceptor heights a formula used to obtain the added lift and drag is proposed but only three parameters which are length of waterline beam and inceptor height were taken into account in the formula although some numerical calculation are adopted in the research the dominating method is still experimental approach day and cooper 2011 the variations for being functional the interceptor s effectiveness induced by form of cross section longitudinal center of gravity and inceptor s geometry are investigated by model test of three 2 8 m long prismatic hulls luca and pensa 2011 it is indicated that deadrise angle has a strong influence on interceptors effectiveness a further study by luca and pensa 2014 found that the scale effects have a significant influence on the correlation procedure to investigate the effect of automatically controlled interceptors on vertical motion reduction of the vessel a high speed planing catamaran model is tested with and without controllable aft interceptors in calm water and regular head waves karimi et al 2015 the model test suggests that application of the controlled aft interceptors can give remarkable reduction in vertical motions and acceleration model test is an important method to investigate the effect of interceptor until today avci and barlas 2019 in recent years numerical method is adopted on the investigation of the effect induced by interceptor with the development of computers rans simulation is adopted to study the effect of interceptor on longitudinal motion of planing catamarans najafi et al 2015 and the results indicate that the effect on hydrodynamic coefficients is negligible except for a few cases both cfd and experiments are used to study hydrodynamics of the interceptor on a 2 d flat plate by mansoori and fernandes 2015 and an important conclusion is the increase of pressure at the end of the flat plate was proportional to the interceptor height this conclusion is more or less the same as the one pointed out by sverre steen which is about 10 years before but both of them make sure the interceptor height is an important parameter in the meantime they pointed out a better trim control is possible within a range by introducing interceptors on fast vessels and the height of interceptor has an important effect on interceptor efficiency mansoori and fernandes 2016b from that time on some researchers investigated new types of appendages based on interceptor talaat et al 2017 mansoori and fernandes 2017 jangam et al 2018 ke wei et al 2018 and how to design a proper interceptor for a specified ship mansoori et al 2017 although the researchers are eager to design new appendages based on interceptor for motion controlling or energy saving two problems are still remaining first of all the hydrodynamic performance of high speed vessels is improved by interceptor but the variation of the flow field is not clear especially the viscous flow field around interceptor deng et al 2011a deng et al 2012 which are necessary for design the other problem is that nearly all researches on interceptor are about the induced effect on the planing boat while it necessary to be investigated for other types of vessel deep vee vessel is widely used by navies all over the world barbato s research barbato et al 2005 indicates that the hydrodynamic performance of deep vee vessels can be improved obviously by interceptor although more details are still needed in the present research a series of simplified deep vee vessels are designed both numerical and experimental methods are adopted in the conditions of different velocities interceptor height deadrise angles the hydrodynamic performance of the deep vee vessels are investigated and the viscous flow field is analyzed by numerical approach in detail the derived conclusions gave a systematical understanding of the effect

respectively y k y ω represents the divergence term of k and k ω respectively g ω represents the orthogonal divergence term in order to simulate the details of the viscous flow field the distance between the first layer of grids and hull surface is set to 0 15 mm and y is about 20 in the condition that velocity is 4 0 m s 3 models and experiment most of the existed researches on the influences induced by interceptor were focused on planing boats and other types of vessels are rarely involved for the deep vee hull form is widely used it is very important to investigate the influence induced by interceptor on the hydrodynamics of deep vee vessel in this research a series of deep vee ship models with deadrise angle ranging from 0 to 20 are designed which have covered almost all the characteristics of this type of ship and the influence induced by interceptor on the viscous flow field around the vessel have been studied in order to reduce the effect of other factors a unification of the length of waterline and width for all designed ship models are performed that is the length and width are set as 3 000 m and 0 375 m respectively therefore the length width ratio l b of the serial ship models are taken as 8 and the configuration and the areas of the waterline plane for all models are the same at the same time the bottom and the sides of models are flat design and the bow of the models are the same the models have transom stern and the sides and transom plate are perpendicular to the horizontal plane the numerical and experimental models are shown in fig 1 the difference between the three models is that the deadrise angle α are 0 model 1 10 model 2 and 20 model 3 respectively and cross section is changed from deep vee type to u shaped type corresponding in order to avoid the influence of the free surface on the flow field around the interceptor and reduce the differences of displacement among the three ship models the draught at the bilge corners of the three models are all set to 0 050 m therefore due to the difference in the deadrise angle α the draft t of three models are 0 050 m model 1 0 083 m model 2 and 0 118 m model 3 respectively the cross sections of the designed models are shown in fig 2 and the main parameters of the three models are shown in table 1 as shown in table 1 l represents the length of waterline b represents the maximum width of the ship model t represents the maximum moulded depth of the hull and α represents the deadrise angle as shown in fig 2 represents the model s displacement the interceptor is fixed on the plane where the transom plate is located and perpendicular to the horizontal plane it also has the consistent width with the vessel s width and extends outwardly along the contour of the transom plate the bottom of the hull is flat plates the distance that the interceptor extends from the bottom is defined as the height of interceptor h the form and position of the interceptor are shown in fig 3 the most important effect caused by interceptor is the induced lift force as well as the modification of hull attitude and viscous flow field almost all the researches on the effect of interceptor have been carried out by free model test which possesses the advantage that the final state of the hull with interceptor can be obtained directly however due to the lackness of constraint the disadvantage of free model test is thatthe initial sinkage and trimming will be changed by the induced lift force resulting in changes of the attack angle and draught of the interceptor and then the lift force will be changed according to a new hull attitude this interaction will repeat until the equilibrium state is achieved but the attack angle and draught of the interceptor in the final equilibrium state are differed from the initial state significantly and it is not reasonable to consider the effect of interceptor as a function of the initial state in such condition therefore it is feasible to adopt the free model test when studying the hydrodynamic and attitude changes of the hull with interceptor but it not feasible when investigating the flow field by the interceptor in order to solve this problem the 6 dof is constrained both in numerical calculation and model test so that the interceptor is always in the initial state and the effect of the interceptor on the flow field could be obtained accurately in the model test see fig 4 the ship model is connected to the six component force and moment sensor directly which are fixed at the intersection of the longitudinal section the middle section and the waterline plane of the ship model to reduce the effect caused by the uncertainties the model test is performed at least two times for the same condition and an average value is obtained from the test data the sensors are connected to the trailer via a rigid connecting rod 4 mesh sensitivity analysis 4 1 verification in this research model 1 is selected to perform the investigation of mesh sensitivity the origin is selected at the intersection of the central longitudinal section the middle plane and the waterline plane of the hull the bow is directed to the negative x axis direction the y axis is directed to the starboard of the hull the z axis is opposite to the direction of gravity and the coordinate system is the right hand cartesian coordinates system as the flow field around the hull is considered symmetrical with respect to the central plane of the hull only the right half of flow field is chosen and the boundary condition of central plane is set as the symmetry plane the size of numerical domain is as follows 1 5l x 3 5l 0 y l 1l z l where l indicates the length of waterline the hull surface is set as rigid wall with no slip condition and the other boundary conditions including velocity inlet and pressure outlet the numerical flow field is discretized by structured meshes three types of mesh are generated on the hull surface of model 1 fine medium and coarse with mesh size s 3 0 mm 5 0 mm and 10 0 mm respectively and the ratios of mesh size to the length of waterline s l are 1 1000 1 600 and 1 300 the y of the mesh generated close to the bottom is taken as 20 in order to capture the flow around the interceptor and the quantities of mesh in the flow field for the three conditions are 20 25 9 54 and 4 10 million respectively for the influence of the turbulence intensity on the calculation of the force acting on high speed deep vee vessel is not remarkable the turbulence intensity adopted in the investigation is 1 the dimensions and boundary conditions of flow field as well as the mesh distribution on the hull surface and near the aft are shown in fig 5 where s represents the mesh size on the hull surface the size of the mesh generated on the hull surface is 3 0 mm the amount of mesh already reaches the maximum limit that the used computer can withstand 1 cpu pc intel core 3 10 ghz 16 gb ram and about 96 h 4 days are needed for each condition when the mesh size on the hull surface is 10 0 mm the meshes are quite sparse and a larger size of mesh will not guarantee the fitness of the meshes on the bow the convection term is calculated by the second order upwind scheme and the sst k ω model is adopted as the turbulence model the ship speed is 3 0 m s the method adopted in the investigation to calculate the free surface and the wave making by the deep vee vessel is vof method to prevent wave reflection a numerical wave beach was established at the outlet boundary of the tank waves can be damped by introducing resistance to their vertical motion the method devised by choi and yoon 2009 the coefficients of vertical force of the hull calculated in each condition are shown in table 2 where cl is the lift coefficient which is calculated using the wetted area of the hull surface and the wetted area of model 1 is 1 375 m2 the lift force is the resultant force along z direction the positive direction of the vertical force is defined along the opposite direction of gravity it can be seen that in the case that the 6 dof motion is constrained the vertical resultant force acting on the hull is an adsorption force when the speed is 3 0 m s and its direction is consistent with the direction of gravity the numerical results above are analyzed and the convergence rate r k is calculated as follow 11 r k ε 21 ε 32 where ε 21 and ε 32 are the difference between the results of fine mesh and medium mesh medium mesh and coarse mesh it can be determined that the solution above is monotonically convergent when the mesh size is reduced the first term of error expansion and its precision p k are calculated as follows 12 δ k 1 δ r e k 1 ε 21 k r k p k 1 13 p k l n ε 32 k ε 21 k l n r k and a correction factor c k is introduced to improve the accuracy 14 c k r k p k 1 r k p k e s t 1 where r k represents the mesh refinement ratio p est is the empirical constant taken as 2 c k 1 indicates that the high order term is negative while c k 1 indicates positive it only needs to analyze the first item in the error expansion for three sets of meshes correcting the equation 11 by considering the influence of the high order term the error obtained is 15 δ k 1 c k δ r e k 1 c k ε 21 k r k p k 1 equation 14 evaluates both the sign and numerical value of the error the assessment of credibility u k depends on how close c k is to 1 c k 0 341 satisfies the condition 1 c k 0 125 and 1 c k 0 25 and the credibility u k and its correction form u kc are as follows 16 u k 2 1 c k 1 δ r e c 17 u k c 1 c k δ r e c 18 s c s 1 δ k 1 according to the method above the values in table 2 are calculated and the verification results are as follows it can be seen from the results in the table that the numerical results are monotonic convergence and meet the necessary criteria 4 2 validation numerical validation is used to evaluate the uncertainty of the model primarily to estimate the sign and value of the model s own error δ s m in addition to the numerical errors experiment data errors must be considered in the analysis of error and uncertainty the validation of the calculation results is as follows 19 d δ d s δ s 20 e d s 1 δ d δ s δ d δ s m a δ s p d δ s n 1 349 where d is the experiment value δ d is the experiment error s is the simulation results δ s is the simulation error e indicates the comparison error δ s m a is the error caused by hypothesis δ s p d is the error caused by adopting empirical data validation is performed by investigation of the uncertainty u v of the results 21 u v 2 u d 2 u s n 2 10 968 2 22 u s n 2 u i 2 u k 2 10 634 23 u i s c f where u i represents the iterative uncertainty u k is the uncertainty of cfd verification cf is the maximum number of iteration steps uncertainty caused by iteration u i approximately equals to zero and the uncertainty of experiment u d 2 5 d the corrected relative error and uncertainty are as follows 24 ec d sc 25 u v c 2 u d 2 u s c n 2 u d 2 u k c 2 the results of validation are shown in table 4 the corrected result satisfies e c uv c indicating that the calculated results are validated effectively through the verification and validation above the independence of mesh have been analyzed therefore the lift of the hull at different speeds are calculated in the conditions of different mesh sizes and compared with experimental data as shown in fig 6 in the fig 6 c l is lift coefficient obtained by non dimensionalization between lift and projected total force in gravitational direction it is shown in the comparison of the lift coefficients calculated by different mesh sizes at each speed that there is no significant difference between the numerical results the results suggest that the simulation of the flow field close to the bottom is the key point to obtain an accurate vertical resultant force of the hull three sets of meshes have been generated in the condition that the y values of the grids at the bottom of the hull are kept consistent therefore even if the amount of mesh element is varied about 4 times the difference between numerical results in each condition and experimental data does not exceed 5 based on the comparison above the mesh size of s l 1 1000 s 10 0 mm is selected to generate mesh on the hull surface in this research the dimensions of the computing domain is 1 5l x 3 5l 0 y l 1l z l where l denotes the length of waterline the computational domain is discretized by multi block structured grids the y value is 20 for the grids close to the bottom considering that the size of the interceptor is too small relative to the hull in order to capture the details of the viscous flow around the interceptor accurately mesh are refined by the size of s l 1 6000 s 0 5 mm in the range of 5 l around the interceptor the amount of structured mesh is about 12 12 million supposing the flow field is symmetrical to the central plane of the hull only a half of the flow field is simulated the convection term was discretized by second order upwind scheme and a time step that equals to 0 005s was adopted the meshes in the computing domain is shown in fig 7 compared with the mesh distribution used in verification and validation the same mesh size and y value are adopted in the improved scheme which makes the numerical results possess sufficient accuracy in addition the mesh is refined in a large area covering the influenced area of the interceptor which means more details of the flow field in the local region can be obtained 4 3 influence on the wave profile the interceptor is mounted on the bottom near stern and induces an effect on the wave profile of the wake flow in fact the drag reduction caused by the interceptor is also inseparable with the improvement of the wave profile of the flow field in order to study the influence on the wave profile of the deep vee vessels the wave profiles in the conditions of different ship cross sections interceptor height and speeds are calculated four sections s1 s2 s3 and s4 in the region the dimension of which is 0 5l x 1 5l and 0 y 0 5l the transom plate is located at x 0 5l are selected and the wave profiles on those four sections are analyzed in detail section s1 is located on the symmetry plane s2 s3 and s4 are parallel to s1 with distance of 1 6l 1 3l and 1 2l respectively the position of the selected sections are shown in fig 8 with reference to the speed of the general types of deep vee vessel two velocities which are 1 5 and 4 0 m s corresponding fr number are 0 277 and 0 737 are selected comparison of the results in each condition is shown in fig 9 in the fig 9 ζ indicates wave amplitude t is the draft and the draughts of the three models are 0 050 m model 1 0 083 m model 2 and 0 118 m model 3 respectively it can be seen that remarkable influence caused by interceptor on the wave profile existed in the wake flow of deep vee vessels at the speed of fr 0 277 v 1 5 m s the difference of wave profiles between the conditions without interceptor h l 0 and with three kinds of interceptors with the height are h l 0 01 0 02 and 0 05 respectively is not obvious the difference decreases when the distance between the section and the longitudinal central plane is increased for ships of different deadrise angles the difference of wave profiles caused by the height of the interceptor is negligible at section s3 on section s4 only for the deadrise angle is α 20 the influence induced by interceptor on wake flow can be distinguished in the conditions that deadrise angle are α 0 and 10 there is basically no remarkable influence on the waveforms that is to say at fr 0 277 the dimension of the influenced domain of the wave profile does not exceed 1 3l in the direction normal to speed on section s1 the virtual length of the ship is increased by the interceptor and no significant changes in the height of the rooster tail flow which is caused by the interceptor the comparison of the wave profiles on section s1 and s2 suggests that the amplitude of the wave increases with the height of the interceptor with the same interceptor the wave amplitude decreases with the deadrise angle α when fr 0 737 v 4 0 m s the influence induced by the interceptor on the wake flow field is quite remarkable even on section s4 the differences in wave amplitude between models with different deadrise angles are still obvious which indicates that speed is an important factor affecting the influence of the interceptor on section s1 it is very clear that there is a significant increase in virtual length when the interceptor is mounted for each model the virtual length increases with the interceptor height and decreases with the deadrise angle which indicates that the effect induced by interceptor on wave profile is sensitive to the form of hull cross section for model 1 with a deadrise angle α 0 the height of rooster tail changes significantly when the height of the interceptor is varied however for model 2 and model 3 even if the height of the interceptor increases from h l 0 001 to 0 002 the height of the rooster tail flow is not changed obviously an obvious variation arises until the interceptor height is increased to h l 0 005 therefore for the model the deadrise angle of which is α 0 the height of the rooster tail flow is sensitive to the variation of the interceptor height but when the deadrise angle is α 0 the rooster tail flow is less sensitive to the interceptor height no significant variation is found when the interceptor height is in a certain range this phenomenon is completely different from the result in literature ke wei et al 2018 in which the hull s motion is not restrained the height of the rooster tail flow and the virtual length decreases with the height of interceptor as shown in fig 10 the major difference between the previously published data and the present results is free model is adopted in the previously research while captured model is adopted in the present investigation for the free model the hull will be lifted up by the force induced by the interceptor which means the draught is reduced and the length of the ship wave can be reduced for the captured model the attitude of the hull will not be changed and the effect of the interceptor can be obtained directly it can be seen that it is unreasonable to use free model when discussing the influence of the interceptor on the flow field since the state of the interceptor has changed by the variation of the hull attitude which is dramatically different from the initial state and affect the influence generally the increase in the virtual length is helpful to reduce resistance for deep vee vessels but the increase in the wave amplitude of flow field is unfavorable for ship resistance as the wave amplitude and the virtual length of wake flow are both increased when the interceptor is mounted therefore the influence induced by the interceptor on resistance of the deep vee vessels will become much more complicated the height of the interceptor used in this study already covers the range that may be applied to the full scale vessel therefore qualitative conclusions can be obtained by analysis the resistance of the ship the calculated speeds are 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 4 0 m s and the corresponding fr numbers are 0 092 0 184 0 277 0 369 0 461 0 553 0 645 and 0 737 the results of the resistance of the three models with different interceptors are shown below in fig 11 ct represents the drag coefficient which is calculated using the wet area of the hull surface and the wet areas of model 1 to model 3 are 1 375 1 401 and 1 460 m2 respectively it can be seen that no matter of the deadrise angle and the height of the interceptor are the resistance coefficients of the constrained models possess the same trend compared with the results which has no interceptor however with interceptor the hull resistance is greater than that without interceptor in other literatures the drag of deep vee vessels whose 6 dof motion isn t constrained can be reduced with a reasonable height of the interceptor ke wei et al 2018 barbato et al 2005 therefore for the deep vee vessels although the interceptor has a certain influence on the waveform of wake flow field such as increasing the virtual length without remarkable increasing the height of the rooster tail flow the deep vee vessels with the interceptor mainly achieves drag reduction by modifying the attitude of the hull if the motion of the hull is constrained the resistance cannot be reduced only by the optimization of the wave profiles 4 4 influence on the pressure distribution on the bottom the influence of the interceptor on the flow field of deep vee vessel is not only on the wave profiles but also on the pressure field around the hull especially the pressure distribution on the bottom of the hull most of the researches have only found that the lift force of the hull can be increased by the interceptor some studies also found that the pressure in front of the interceptor is increased but there is no detailed conclusions on the variation of pressure distribution on the bottom of the hull caused by the interceptor and no related research on deep vee vessels therefore in order to obtain the general rules and details of the pressure distribution variation caused by the interceptor the pressure distribution on the bottom of the three designed models with different speeds and interceptor heights are analyzed the velocities adopted in the calculation are fr 0 092 v 0 5 m s fr 0 277 v 1 5 m s and fr 0 737 v 4 0 m s the extent of the area in which the pressure distribution is analyzed is 1 2 l in front of the interceptor as shown in fig 12 a the pressure distribution on the bottom in each case is compared as shown in fig 12 b d in fig 12 the bow is heading left and the pressure is the relative total pressure in the case of fr 0 092 v 0 5 m s and without the interceptor as well as the deadrise angle of which is α 0 the rule of the pressure distribution on the bottom of model 1 is quite clear the high pressure area is located in the front and middle of the selected region and the pressure gradually decreases towards the stern for model 2 and 3 the deadrise angles of which are α 10 and α 20 in the condition of without interceptor although the pressure distribution is more uniform due to the increase of draught the pressure still gradually decreases toward the stern when the interceptor is installed a significant change of pressure distribution occurs a high pressure zone is formed in front of the interceptor and the maximum pressure is greater than that without the interceptor in the same condition the extent of the high pressure area increased with the interceptor height increases at the same speed this phenomenon is consistent with mansoori and fernandes 2016b and the results in mansoori and fernandes 2016b are shown in fig 13 when the speed is fr 0 277 v 1 5 m s and without the interceptor the phenomenon that the high pressure zone is located in the front and middle of the region while decreasing toward the stern is clear with interceptor a strip shaped high pressure zone is formed in the front of the interceptor for model 1 the deadrise angle of which is 0 for model 2 and 3 it is difficult to generate a strip shaped high pressure zone due to the presence of the deadrise angle a triangular high pressure zone is formed in front of the interceptor and the pressure at the sides of the area is decreased rapidly the pressure and the area of high pressure zone is increased with the interceptor height when the speed is fr 0 737 v 4 0 m s the pressure and area of strip shaped high pressure zone on the bottom of model 1 and the triangular high pressure zone on the bottom of model 2 and model 3 are further increased therefore it can be confirmed that speed is an important factor affecting the effect of the interceptor at the same time the increase of the interceptor height will result in a rapid increase in the extent of the high pressure zone it is found that the pressure distribution on the bottom of the hull has been completely changed by the interceptor but the influence of the interceptor on the total lift force is still unknown therefore the lift coefficients of the three models without and with different interceptors are calculated and the speeds are 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 and 4 0 m s the corresponded fr numbers are 0 092 0 184 0 277 0 3 69 0 461 0 553 0 645 and 0 737 the results are compared as shown in fig 14 the projected areas used to non dimensionalize the total lift force of three models are the same which is 1 068 m2 the positive direction of the lift is defined as the opposite direction of gravity and the negative value in fig 14 indicates that the hull is subjected to the fluid force along the direction of the gravity when the 6 dof motion of the hull is constrained when the ship is without the interceptor the vertical resultant force decrease with the speed and increase with the deadrise angle when the ship hull is with the interceptor the resultant lift force is improved significantly it is demonstrated in fig 14 that the lift force induced by the interceptor is increased with the speed and the interceptor height for each designed model meanwhile the lift force is decrease with the increase of deadrise angle at the same velocity it is observed that not only the pressure distribution on the bottom is modified by the interceptor but also the resultant lift force is increased obviously which is an important factor for hull attitude in addition there is a linear relationship between the lift coefficient and fr number as well as the interceptor height when fr 0 2 in order to determine the extent of the high pressure area 436 pressure monitoring points were set on the bottom from the midship section to the interceptor on the central longitudinal plane and the variation of the pressure at the monitoring points were compared in each case the pressure comparison at the monitoring points for the three models with different interceptors at speeds of fr 0 092 0 277 and 0 737 v 0 5 1 5 and 4 0 m s are shown in fig 15 in fig 15 the origin of the abscissa is set at the midship cross section and p is the relative pressure consistent with that in fig 12 as can be seen without the interceptor the relative pressure is decreasing rapidly toward the stern due to fluid separation the extent of the pressure decaying zone generated is about 10 l in front of the stern and it is insusceptible to the speed and deadrise angle but the rate of pressure decay is increased with the speed and deadrise angle with interceptor the pressure distribution on the bottom is changed completely and the pressure decaying zone close to the stern is eliminated completely at the same time the relative pressure gradually increases towards the stern until a maximum pressure is reached in front of the interceptor that is a high pressure zone is formed in front of the interceptor it is interesting that as the height of the interceptor increases the maximum pressure in the high pressure zone is not located on the interceptor but at the vicinity of the interceptor this phenomenon was found in this research when the mesh size of s l 1 6000 was adopted to refine the area of 5 l in front and back of the interceptor which has not been found in the other literatures as can be seen from the figure the extent of the high pressure zone is insusceptible to the speed and interceptor height for model 1 with a deadrise angle of α 0 the maximum pressure induced by the interceptor with a height of h 15 mm in the condition that velocity is v 4 0 m s fr 0 737 is about 10 times of the pressure outside the high pressure zone but for model 3 in the same condition the maximum pressure is about 4 times of the one outside the zone therefore in the condition of the same speed and interceptor height it is indicated that the pressure in front of the interceptor is reduced by the deadrise angle i e the lift is reduced which is consistent with the conclusion in fig 14 5 influence on the velocity distribution from the previous analysis it is found that the pressure decaying zone close to the stern is changed to high pressure zone in front of the interceptor the extent of which is about 10 l and a nonlinear increase of pressure is caused which result in a maximum value of pressure in the zone but the extent of the region in which pressure is increased significantly is about 1 25 l 45 0 mm in front of the interceptor a detailed study on the flow field in this sub region is carried out to analyze such nonlinear phenomenon in which five parallel sections were set in the vicinity of the stern the length and height of these sections are 0 09 m and 0 11 m covering the area where the pressure changes nonlinearly these sections are parallel to the central longitudinal plane and the distance between the two adjacent sections is 1 8b where b is the width of the ship and p1 section is located on the central longitudinal section the sections are shown in fig 16 longitudinal velocity distributions on the selected sections of three models with different interceptors in the conditions of different velocities which are v 0 5 m s v 1 5 m s and v 4 0 m s fr is 0 092 0 277 and 0 737 are shown in fig 17 the velocity demonstrated in fig 17 is the component along longitudinal direction it can be observed that without the interceptor h l 0 the velocity is uniform distributed on all the sections for each model at the three speeds when the interceptor was installed the influence on the flow field is significant even at the lower speed fr 0 092 it can be seen that the velocity is reduced significantly in the area in front of the interceptor and this phenomenon is remarkable when the speed and the height of the interceptor is increased in the condition of fr 0 737 and the height of the interceptor is h l 0 005 an approximate triangular area is formed on the bottom of the hull in front of the interceptor in this area not only the velocity is decayed significantly but also a reverse flow is generated in the condition that deadrise angle α 0 the effect of the interceptor on decaying the flow velocity is reduced from p1 to p5 section i e to the sides of the hull and is influenced by the deadrise angle for model 1 with deadrise angle α 0 fr 0 737 and h l 0 the velocity distribution is not varied obviously from p1 to p5 section however for model 3 with α 20 there is a significant difference in the velocity distribution between the p1 and p5 sections the phenomenon coincides with the pressure distribution on the bottom of the hull in the previous part that is the high pressure generated in front of the interceptor of model 2 and model 3 is reduced rapidly in addition at the high speed of fr 0 737 it can be found that the extent of the influenced area of the interceptor in the longitudinal direction is larger than that in the direction of depth in order to analysis this phenomenon the flow field around the interceptor on the central longitudinal plane of model 1 are compared in the conditions of fr 0 092 0 277 and 0 737 v 0 5 m s v 1 5 m s and v 4 0 m s and the flow details are shown in fig 18 it is demonstrated in the figure that a vortex is generated in front of the interceptor at any speed as long as the interceptor is mounted and the streamlines around the vortexes are deflected and bypass the vortex this phenomenon is consistent with the phenomenon obtained in the literature mansoori and fernandes 2015 completely that is shown in fig 19 but much more details about the flow field is offered in the present paper it can be seen from fig 18 that the vortex is oblate which is different from the results in fig 19 the dimension of the vortex is related to the height of the interceptor significantly but little of the speed the vertical dimension of the vortex is about 2 3 of the height of the interceptor while the horizontal scale is about 1 times of it due to the existence of the vortex the streamline is forced to bypass and a vertical velocity component is generated combined with the velocity distribution shown in fig 17 it is indicated that a strip shaped vortexes which is continuous distributed along the width of the interceptor is formed in front of the interceptor the maximum vortex intensity is obtained on the central longitudinal plane and the intensity is decreased towards both sides due to the influence of the external flow field the width of the interceptor adopted in this study equals to the width of the hull therefore the vortex possesses the maximum intensity on the central longitudinal plane in front of the interceptor and decaying towards the sides of the hull rapidly in addition in the case of high speed and larger interceptor height it can be found that a smaller vortex is derived in front of the strip shaped vortexes the dimension of which is about 1 10 of the larger vortex in front of the interceptor the smaller vortex and the larger vortex formed a tandem vortex of various scales attaching on the bottom which leads to an enlargement of the extent of the influenced area induced by the interceptor along the direction of the ship length due to the limits of computer used in this research it is difficult to simulate the flow field around the hull with a finer grids therefore the existence of the tandem vortices can only be found in the condition of high speed and high interceptor height in the present paper in the further study an interesting research whether or not a series of vortices of decreasing scales will be found in the affected area in front of the interceptor when the speed is not zero can be performed the influence induced by the interceptor can be regarded as an integral of the influence caused by the serial vortices which is helpful to the researches investigating the viscous flow field around interceptor by potential method 6 conclusions in this research a series of simplified models of deep vee vessels were designed in the study numerical calculation and experimental research were carried out the wave profiles of wake flow the hull resistance the pressure distribution on the bottom and the central longitudinal section the total lift as well as the velocity distribution and streamline around the interceptor were analyzed and compared between the serial models the 6 dof motion of which are constrained in the conditions of different interceptor heights speed and deadrise angles the following conclusions were obtained a the effect induced by the interceptor on the aft flow field is mainly concentrated on the virtual length and the height of rooster tail flow in the case of restraining the 6 dof motion of the hull the virtual length increases with the speed of the ship and the height of the interceptor at the same speed the height of rooster tail flow is sensitive to the height of interceptor when the deadrise angle is 0 but the sensitivity become weak when the deadrise angle α 0 b for deep vee vessels drag reduction induced by the interceptor is mainly achieved by changing the attitude of the hull in the case of restraining the 6 dof motion of the hull even if the wave profiles of the wake flow is optimized it is still difficult to reduce the drag c with the interceptor the pressure distribution on the bottom of the deep vee vessel has changed significantly a high pressure zone in the area the extent of which is about 10 l in front of the interceptor was formed the pressure in the middle of the region is higher and is decayed towards the sides and it increases rapidly with the speed and the height of the interceptor in the case of fr 0 2 the lift coefficient induced by the interceptor is approximate a linear relationship with both the fr number and the interceptor height when the speed and the interceptor height are the same the lift induced by the interceptor decreases as the deadrise angle is increasing d a continuous distributed vortices is induced by the interceptor in front of it the shape of the cross section of the vortex is oblate the vertical dimension of the vortex is about 2 3 times of the interceptor height and the horizontal dimension is about 1 time the vortex intensity is decayed from the middle of the interceptor to its sides and its decaying ratio is increased with the speed and the deadrise angle in the cases of higher speed and larger interceptor height a small scale vortex is formed in front of the larger vortex induced and formed tandem vortices the general rule of the influence induced by the interceptor on the viscous flow field of the deep vee vessel is given in this research the obtained conclusions are helpful for the designing of the interceptor of deep vee vessel and simulating the flow field which is of viscous effect by potential method acknowledgements these financial support has been provided by the national natural science foundation of china grant

consists of two envelopes one is to stabilize the individual vessel to the virtual vessel moving along with the predefined path the other is to synchronize the surge speed of virtual vehicles to guarantee the desired geometric formation within the design framework a nonlinear disturbance observer dob is constructed to estimate the lumped disturbance which includes the model uncertainty and the unknown disturbance by virtue of the auxiliary system and the novel tan type barrier lyapunov function blf the observer based control law is designed to eliminate the effect of the input and velocity constraints furthermore on the basis of the undirected graph the speed agreement is presented to ensure the motion synchronization of networked underactuated vessels compared with the existing results the proposed algorithm is more applicable to the marine practice e g the collaborative search and rescue scene through the lyapunov analysis it is proved that all the variables of the closed loop system are with the uniform ultimate bounded stability finally the scaling formation example and comparison simulation are conducted to illustrate the effective of the proposed algorithm keywords underactuated surface vessels coordinated path following input and velocity constraints disturbance observer undirected graph 1 introduction compared with the individual agent multiple agents are with higher efficiency and flexibility in the practical tasks successful application of networked agents can be found in diverse areas e g the marine surface vehicle the underwater unmanned vehicle and the unmanned aerial vehicle xu et al 2019 in order to meet requirements of different applications there are four typical approaches to address the corresponding engineering problem such as the leader follower approach chen et al 2010 peng et al 2013 das et al 2002 the virtual structure approach ren 2004 zhang et al 2013 xu and authoranonymous 2018 the behavioral based approach balch 1998 lawton et al 2003 and the artificial potential approach ghommam et al 2010 nguyen et al 2017 in particular the coordinated path following control of multiple vehicles is to steer a group of networked vehicles to follow the predefined path while keeping a desired formation over the past decades the coordinated path following control of underactuated marine vehicles has been greatly developed and widely employed to solve various formation control difficulties in almeida et al 2010 an adaptive coordinated path following algorithm is proposed for the multiple surface vehicles and the dynamic impact of the ocean current is implicitly compensated without the prior knowledge of the current disturbance for the output feedback cases an observer based control algorithm is presented in vanni et al 2008 aguiar and pascoal 2007 to implement the coordinated path following task of multiple underactuated surface vehicles in the algorithm an improved communication strategy is employed to eliminate the effect of the time delays between the networked vehicles using only the attitude information of the leader ship including the position coordinate and the yaw angle the drifting effect produced by ocean currents could be stabilized effectively by employing the nns and dob in lu et al 2018 lyapunov theory is used to guarantee that the error states of the closed loop system are semi global uniformly ultimately bounded sguub in zong and shao 2016 a novel terminal sliding mode disturbance observer is developed on the basis of the adaptive parameter estimation strategy unlike previous work the proposed disturbance observer needs no upper bound information of the lumped disturbance similar research can be found in xia and huo 2016 a robust nonlinear control algorithm is presented to address the spacecraft cooperative rendezvous task and a second order disturbance observer is employed to estimate and compensate the lumped disturbance the aforementioned work is mainly dedicated to guarantee the robustness of the closed loop system with the model uncertainty and the unknown environmental disturbance though the system state constraint is another critical factor that could affect the system performance in the engineering practice even lead to invalidation of the conventional control schemes actually the system constraint is induced mainly by the physical limitation of the servo actuator that is for underactuated surface vehicle the main engine propeller or the rudder servo system cannot provide the unlimited energy to implement the ship maneuvering task in chen et al 2009 xu and shou 2018 a traditional adaptive control algorithm is developed for the multi input and multi output mimo system in the presence of the amplitude and rate saturation furthermore the proposed scheme has been extended in jin and kwong 2015 to deal with the problem of the actuator fault in practical system and experiment has been conduct to illustrate the excellent performance of the algorithm considering both the thruster fault and error constraint a novel distributed finite time containment control algorithm is presented for multiple ocean bottom flying node obfn systems in qin et al 2019a b by converting error variable into a suitable form the error constraint strategy is developed to improve the steady and transient state performance of the closed loop system in chwa 2011 a robust control law is designed for the underactuated ship with velocity constraint the proposed algorithm is with a simplifier form that is more applicable in the marine practice in jin 2016 zheng et al 2018 zheng and feroskhan 2017 the constraint around the line of sight los range and angle is addressed in the algorithm and the formation control system is with the finite time convergence and predetermined guidance performance as for the path following task of the individual underactuated vehicle liu et al 2017 presents a concise robust adaptive control algorithm to eliminate the effect of the input saturation which could reduce the abrasion of the actuator effectively in ghommam et al 2018 a robust adaptive algorithm is developed for the marine vessel with actuator saturation and external disturbance the blf is employed to address the time varying constraint on the off track error of the path motivated by the above observations an improved robust coordinated path following control algorithm is developed for multiple underactuated surface vessels with the actuator constraint and the unknown environmental disturbance compared with the existing results the robust coordinated path following control algorithm is developed by using the blf and auxiliary system to deal with the input and velocity constraint simultaneously the corresponding controller is with characteristics of the lumped disturbance rejection capability and only the local information communication requirement therefore the proposed is more applicable to the marine practice the main contribution of the manuscript can be summarized as follows 1 an improved nonlinear dob is developed to estimate the lumped disturbance which includes the model uncertainty and the unknown external disturbance different from the traditional dobs the proposed dob is easy to be constructed and could acquire the lumped disturbance information effectively and accurately 2 the observer based constrained control algorithm is proposed for multiple surface vehicles to perform coordinated path following task for merits of the auxiliary system the effect of the input and velocity constraints are eliminated simultaneously by employing the tan type blf the proposed control law could guarantee that the limitation requirement on actuators would not be violated during the operation that could facilitate the implementation of the proposed algorithm in the practical engineering 2 problem formulation and preliminaries throughout this note indicates the absolute operator

respect to θ i 2 1 algebraic and graph theory consider the networked formation system which includes n homogeneous underactuated surface vessels the information exchange between the n underactuated surface vessels can be modeled by the undirected graph g g ν ε where ν υ 1 υ 2 υ n denotes a finite set with n nodes ε denotes the set of edges with elements e i j υ i υ j υ i υ j ε means that υ i and υ j are adjacent if there is communication between any two nodes in g then g is connected the adjacency matrix a a i j r n n is a square matrix with nonnegative elements a i j 1 if e i j ε and a i j 0 if e i j ε the degree matrix of g is d d i j r n n which is a diagonal matrix with elements d i j n i a i j where n i υ j ν υ i υ j ε denotes the set of neighbors for υ i the laplacian matrix of graph g is denoted as l and can be obtained by l d a 2 2 underactuated ship dynamics consider n homogeneous underactuated vessels that driven by two independent actuators as the common configuration such as the marine surface vessels employed in zhang et al 2015 li et al 2008 in this configuration only the surge and yaw degree of freedom dof is directly controlled thus the dynamics of the vessel is underactuated to avoid the coupling effect between the yaw and sway dof the origin of the body fixed frame is chosen properly such that it is on the centerline of the vessel the kinematic model for the ith underactuated vessel is defined as 1 1 x i u i c o s ψ i v i s i n ψ i y i u i s i n ψ i v i c o s ψ i ψ i r i where x i y i ψ i denote the position and heading angle of the ith vessel in earth fixed frame u i v i r i are the ship velocities in surge sway and yaw dof in the body fixed frame the dynamic model for the ith underactuated vessel is formulated as follows 2 m u i u i f u i τ u i τ w u i m v i v i f v i τ w v i m r i r i f r i τ r i τ w r i where m u i m v i m r i are all inertial coefficients f u i m v i v i r i d u i u i f v i m u i u i r i d v i v i f r i m v i m u i u i v i d r i r i are nonlinear functions d u i d v i d r i are hydrodynamic damping coefficients τ u i τ r i are control inputs produced by propeller and rudder τ w u i τ w v i τ w r i are marine environmental disturbances induced by wind wave and current in the surge sway and yaw directions assumption 1 in practice the actual control inputs are restricted due to the physical limitation of actuators therefore the effective control actions on the ship s hull are not equal to the control command for ℓ i u i v i r i the control input constraint can be defined by the saturation function as follows 3 s a t τ ℓ i τ ℓ i m a x i f τ ℓ i τ ℓ i m a x τ ℓ i i f τ ℓ i m i n τ ℓ i τ ℓ i m a x τ ℓ i m i n i f τ ℓ i τ ℓ i m i n where τ ℓ i is the control command without considering the input constraint τ ℓ i m a x τ ℓ i m i n are upper and lower bounds of the physical limitation assumption 2 due to the limited revolution rate of propeller and deflection angle of rudder there always exist constraint on the velocity of ship which can be described as follows 4 ℓ i t k ℓ i where ℓ i u i v i r i denotes the ship velocity k ℓ i r is the constraint on the ship velocity in addition that there exist α ℓ i k d ℓ i where α ℓ i denotes the virtual controller k d ℓ i r is a continuous function and k ℓ i k d ℓ i assumption 3 in 2 the disturbance τ w ℓ i ℓ i u i v i r i is bounded due to the limited energy of marine environment i e there exist positive constant c 0 such that τ w ℓ i c in addition the ship model parameters are not known exactly and bounded i e m ℓ i m ℓ i d ℓ i d ℓ i 2 3 coordinated path following problem for a group of n underactuated surface vessels the moving virtual vehicles are introduced to generate reference path information for multiple underactuated vessels the original virtual vehicle which defined in the center of the geometric pattern is used to generated the original reference path information for the whole formation while the original virtual vehicle is setup with desired speed assignment n sets of path information for multiple underactuated vessels can be generated by introducing offset vector l i i 1 2 n let η d 0 θ 0 c o l p d 0 θ 0 ψ d 0 θ 0 be the original reference path see fig 1 parameterized by a continuous variable θ 0 r where p d 0 θ 0 x d 0 θ 0 y d 0 θ 0 denotes the position of the original virtual vehicle in the earth fixed plane ψ d 0 θ 0 denotes the heading angle then the reference path η d i θ i c o l p d i θ i ψ d i θ i for the ith vessel in the formation system can be obtained by introducing a offset vector l i x d i θ i y d i θ i where p d i θ i x d i θ i y d i θ i is the position and ψ d i θ i is the heading of virtual vehicle for the ith vessel and can be defined as 5 p d i θ i p d 0 θ 0 r i s l i x d i θ i y d i θ i the rotation matrix is 6 r i c o s ψ i s i n ψ i s i n ψ i c o s ψ i where ψ i is the rotation angle the scaling matrix is 7 s s 1 t 0 0 s 2 t where s 1 s 2 are scaling factors this means that the desired formation is with scaling ability over time the geometric pattern shrinks when the scaling factors decrease and expands when the scaling factors increase 8 l i x d i θ i y d i θ i f x i x d i θ i y d i θ i f y i x d i θ i y d i θ i where f x i f y i are the offset functions related to different formation constraint remark 1 for conventional coordinated path following problem the offset vector l i x d i θ i y d i θ i is generally selected as a constant parameter in order to achieve fixed geometric pattern however the offset functions f x i f y i may be time varying which result in time varying geometric pattern the control objective of this note is to develop a control algorithm for networked underactuated vessels to build and maintain a desired geometric pattern under environmental disturbance i e all vessels in the formation system should converge to their virtual vehicles which moving along with the predefined paths at the same surge speed 9 lim t η di θ i η i t δ i 1 10 lim t θ i v d i θ i δ i 2 11 lim t θ i θ j δ i 3 where η i is the position of the ith vessel v d i θ r is the speed assignment δ i 1 δ i 2 δ i 3 r are small constants 3 coordinated path following controller design the coordinated path following control for multiple underactuated vessels can be realized by two envelope control design see fig 2 for the individual path following envelop the nonlinear disturbance observer is first presented to reconstruct the information about the lumped disturbance which comprised of the environmental disturbance and model uncertainty then the observer based path following controller is designed for the individual vessel to follow its virtual vehicle with consideration of physical limitation for the coordinated path following envelop the speed agreement is developed to synchronize the surge speed of virtual vehicles based on the local information finally the coordinated path following for multiple underactuated vessels is realized with desired geometric pattern under the ingenious design of the two envelopes 3 1 construction of the dob in this section a novel dob is constructed to improve the disturbance rejection capability of the underactuated vessel by observing the lumped disturbance which includes the model uncertainty and environmental disturbance the designed dob is with the advantages of high observation accuracy and concise form define m ℓ i m ℓ i m ℓ i f ℓ i f ℓ i f ℓ i ℓ i u i v i r i m ℓ i f ℓ i are known nominal values of m ℓ i f ℓ i the ship dynamic can be re rewritten as 12 m ℓ i ℓ i f ℓ i τ ℓ i d f ℓ i where d f ℓ i τ w ℓ i m ℓ i ℓ i f ℓ i is the lumped disturbance design the dob as follows 13 d ˆ f ℓ i ξ ℓ i k o i m ℓ i ℓ i ξ ℓ i k o i ξ ℓ i k o i τ ℓ i k o i m ℓ i ℓ i f ℓ i where ξ ℓ i is the

trajectory of v d f ℓ i can be bounded by 18 v d f ℓ i σ o i 2 β o i v d f ℓ i 0 σ o i 2 β o i e 2 β o i t obviously we have lim t v d f ℓ i t σ o i 2 β o i which indicates that the disturbance error d f ℓ i can converge to the origin with the radius σ o i 2 β o i exponentially furthermore the radius σ o i 2 β o i can be made small enough by adjusting parameters k o i appropriately this completes

control of multiple vessels in this section in order to achieve control objectives 10 and 11 it is necessary to synchronize the surge speed of virtual vehicles and path parameters the undirected graph

22182,this note proposed a practical coordinated path following algorithm for a group of underactuated surface vessels to achieve and maintain the desired formation pattern the developed scheme consists of two envelopes one is to stabilize the individual vessel to the virtual vessel moving along with the predefined path the other is to synchronize the surge speed of virtual vehicles to guarantee the desired geometric formation within the design framework a nonlinear disturbance observer dob is constructed to estimate the lumped disturbance which includes the model uncertainty and the unknown disturbance by virtue of the auxiliary system and the novel tan type barrier lyapunov function blf the observer based control law is designed to eliminate the effect of the input and velocity constraints furthermore on the basis of the undirected graph the speed agreement is presented to ensure the motion synchronization of networked underactuated vessels compared with the existing results the proposed algorithm is more applicable to the marine practice e g the collaborative search and rescue scene through the lyapunov analysis it is proved that all the variables of the closed loop system are with the uniform ultimate bounded stability finally the scaling formation example and comparison simulation are conducted to illustrate the effective of the proposed algorithm keywords underactuated surface vessels coordinated path following input and velocity constraints disturbance observer undirected graph 1 introduction compared with the individual agent multiple agents are with higher efficiency and flexibility in the practical tasks successful application of networked agents can be found in diverse areas e g the marine surface vehicle the underwater unmanned vehicle and the unmanned aerial vehicle xu et al 2019 in order to meet requirements of different applications there are four typical approaches to address the corresponding engineering problem such as the leader follower approach chen et al 2010 peng et al 2013 das et al 2002 the virtual structure approach ren 2004 zhang et al 2013 xu and authoranonymous 2018 the behavioral based approach balch 1998 lawton et al 2003 and the artificial potential approach ghommam et al 2010 nguyen et al 2017 in particular the coordinated path following control of multiple vehicles is to steer a group of networked vehicles to follow the predefined path while keeping a desired formation over the past decades the coordinated path following control of underactuated marine vehicles has been greatly developed and widely employed to solve various formation control difficulties in almeida et al 2010 an adaptive coordinated path following algorithm is proposed for the multiple surface vehicles and the dynamic impact of the ocean current is implicitly compensated without the prior knowledge of the current disturbance for the output feedback cases an observer based control algorithm is presented in vanni et al 2008 aguiar and pascoal 2007 to implement the coordinated path following task of multiple underactuated surface vehicles in the algorithm an improved communication strategy is employed to eliminate the effect of the time delays between the networked vehicles using only the attitude information of the leader ship including the position coordinate and the yaw angle the drifting effect produced by ocean currents could be stabilized effectively by employing the nns and dob in lu et al 2018 lyapunov theory is used to guarantee that the error states of the closed loop system are semi global uniformly ultimately bounded sguub in zong and shao 2016 a novel terminal sliding mode disturbance observer is developed on the basis of the adaptive parameter estimation strategy unlike previous work the proposed disturbance observer needs no upper bound information of the lumped disturbance similar research can be found in xia and huo 2016 a robust nonlinear control algorithm is presented to address the spacecraft cooperative rendezvous task and a second order disturbance observer is employed to estimate and compensate the lumped disturbance the aforementioned work is mainly dedicated to guarantee the robustness of the closed loop system with the model uncertainty and the unknown environmental disturbance though the system state constraint is another critical factor that could affect the system performance in the engineering practice even lead to invalidation of the conventional control schemes actually the system constraint is induced mainly by the physical limitation of the servo actuator that is for underactuated surface vehicle the main engine propeller or the rudder servo system cannot provide the unlimited energy to implement the ship maneuvering task in chen et al 2009 xu and shou 2018 a traditional adaptive control algorithm is developed for the multi input and multi output mimo system in the presence of the amplitude and rate saturation furthermore the proposed scheme has been extended in jin and kwong 2015 to deal with the problem of the actuator fault in practical system and experiment has been conduct to illustrate the excellent performance of the algorithm considering both the thruster fault and error constraint a novel distributed finite time containment control algorithm is presented for multiple ocean bottom flying node obfn systems in qin et al 2019a b by converting error variable into a suitable form the error constraint strategy is developed to improve the steady and transient state performance of the closed loop system in chwa 2011 a robust control law is designed for the underactuated ship with velocity constraint the proposed algorithm is with a simplifier form that is more applicable in the marine practice in jin 2016 zheng et al 2018 zheng and feroskhan 2017 the constraint around the line of sight los range and angle is addressed in the algorithm and the formation control system is with the finite time convergence and predetermined guidance performance as for the path following task of the individual underactuated vehicle liu et al 2017 presents a concise robust adaptive control algorithm to eliminate the effect of the input saturation which could reduce the abrasion of the actuator effectively in ghommam et al 2018 a robust adaptive algorithm is developed for the marine vessel with actuator saturation and external disturbance the blf is employed to address the time varying constraint on the off track error of the path motivated by the above observations an improved robust coordinated path following control algorithm is developed for multiple underactuated surface vessels with the actuator constraint and the unknown environmental disturbance compared with the existing results the robust coordinated path following control algorithm is developed by using the blf and auxiliary system to deal with the input and velocity constraint simultaneously the corresponding controller is with characteristics of the lumped disturbance rejection capability and only the local information communication requirement therefore the proposed is more applicable to the marine practice the main contribution of the manuscript can be summarized as follows 1 an improved nonlinear dob is developed to estimate the lumped disturbance which includes the model uncertainty and the unknown external disturbance different from the traditional dobs the proposed dob is easy to be constructed and could acquire the lumped disturbance information effectively and accurately 2 the observer based constrained control algorithm is proposed for multiple surface vehicles to perform coordinated path following task for merits of the auxiliary system the effect of the input and velocity constraints are eliminated simultaneously by employing the tan type blf the proposed control law could guarantee that the limitation requirement on actuators would not be violated during the operation that could facilitate the implementation of the proposed algorithm in the practical engineering 2 problem formulation and preliminaries throughout this note indicates the absolute operator

respect to θ i 2 1 algebraic and graph theory consider the networked formation system which includes n homogeneous underactuated surface vessels the information exchange between the n underactuated surface vessels can be modeled by the undirected graph g g ν ε where ν υ 1 υ 2 υ n denotes a finite set with n nodes ε denotes the set of edges with elements e i j υ i υ j υ i υ j ε means that υ i and υ j are adjacent if there is communication between any two nodes in g then g is connected the adjacency matrix a a i j r n n is a square matrix with nonnegative elements a i j 1 if e i j ε and a i j 0 if e i j ε the degree matrix of g is d d i j r n n which is a diagonal matrix with elements d i j n i a i j where n i υ j ν υ i υ j ε denotes the set of neighbors for υ i the laplacian matrix of graph g is denoted as l and can be obtained by l d a 2 2 underactuated ship dynamics consider n homogeneous underactuated vessels that driven by two independent actuators as the common configuration such as the marine surface vessels employed in zhang et al 2015 li et al 2008 in this configuration only the surge and yaw degree of freedom dof is directly controlled thus the dynamics of the vessel is underactuated to avoid the coupling effect between the yaw and sway dof the origin of the body fixed frame is chosen properly such that it is on the centerline of the vessel the kinematic model for the ith underactuated vessel is defined as 1 1 x i u i c o s ψ i v i s i n ψ i y i u i s i n ψ i v i c o s ψ i ψ i r i where x i y i ψ i denote the position and heading angle of the ith vessel in earth fixed frame u i v i r i are the ship velocities in surge sway and yaw dof in the body fixed frame the dynamic model for the ith underactuated vessel is formulated as follows 2 m u i u i f u i τ u i τ w u i m v i v i f v i τ w v i m r i r i f r i τ r i τ w r i where m u i m v i m r i are all inertial coefficients f u i m v i v i r i d u i u i f v i m u i u i r i d v i v i f r i m v i m u i u i v i d r i r i are nonlinear functions d u i d v i d r i are hydrodynamic damping coefficients τ u i τ r i are control inputs produced by propeller and rudder τ w u i τ w v i τ w r i are marine environmental disturbances induced by wind wave and current in the surge sway and yaw directions assumption 1 in practice the actual control inputs are restricted due to the physical limitation of actuators therefore the effective control actions on the ship s hull are not equal to the control command for ℓ i u i v i r i the control input constraint can be defined by the saturation function as follows 3 s a t τ ℓ i τ ℓ i m a x i f τ ℓ i τ ℓ i m a x τ ℓ i i f τ ℓ i m i n τ ℓ i τ ℓ i m a x τ ℓ i m i n i f τ ℓ i τ ℓ i m i n where τ ℓ i is the control command without considering the input constraint τ ℓ i m a x τ ℓ i m i n are upper and lower bounds of the physical limitation assumption 2 due to the limited revolution rate of propeller and deflection angle of rudder there always exist constraint on the velocity of ship which can be described as follows 4 ℓ i t k ℓ i where ℓ i u i v i r i denotes the ship velocity k ℓ i r is the constraint on the ship velocity in addition that there exist α ℓ i k d ℓ i where α ℓ i denotes the virtual controller k d ℓ i r is a continuous function and k ℓ i k d ℓ i assumption 3 in 2 the disturbance τ w ℓ i ℓ i u i v i r i is bounded due to the limited energy of marine environment i e there exist positive constant c 0 such that τ w ℓ i c in addition the ship model parameters are not known exactly and bounded i e m ℓ i m ℓ i d ℓ i d ℓ i 2 3 coordinated path following problem for a group of n underactuated surface vessels the moving virtual vehicles are introduced to generate reference path information for multiple underactuated vessels the original virtual vehicle which defined in the center of the geometric pattern is used to generated the original reference path information for the whole formation while the original virtual vehicle is setup with desired speed assignment n sets of path information for multiple underactuated vessels can be generated by introducing offset vector l i i 1 2 n let η d 0 θ 0 c o l p d 0 θ 0 ψ d 0 θ 0 be the original reference path see fig 1 parameterized by a continuous variable θ 0 r where p d 0 θ 0 x d 0 θ 0 y d 0 θ 0 denotes the position of the original virtual vehicle in the earth fixed plane ψ d 0 θ 0 denotes the heading angle then the reference path η d i θ i c o l p d i θ i ψ d i θ i for the ith vessel in the formation system can be obtained by introducing a offset vector l i x d i θ i y d i θ i where p d i θ i x d i θ i y d i θ i is the position and ψ d i θ i is the heading of virtual vehicle for the ith vessel and can be defined as 5 p d i θ i p d 0 θ 0 r i s l i x d i θ i y d i θ i the rotation matrix is 6 r i c o s ψ i s i n ψ i s i n ψ i c o s ψ i where ψ i is the rotation angle the scaling matrix is 7 s s 1 t 0 0 s 2 t where s 1 s 2 are scaling factors this means that the desired formation is with scaling ability over time the geometric pattern shrinks when the scaling factors decrease and expands when the scaling factors increase 8 l i x d i θ i y d i θ i f x i x d i θ i y d i θ i f y i x d i θ i y d i θ i where f x i f y i are the offset functions related to different formation constraint remark 1 for conventional coordinated path following problem the offset vector l i x d i θ i y d i θ i is generally selected as a constant parameter in order to achieve fixed geometric pattern however the offset functions f x i f y i may be time varying which result in time varying geometric pattern the control objective of this note is to develop a control algorithm for networked underactuated vessels to build and maintain a desired geometric pattern under environmental disturbance i e all vessels in the formation system should converge to their virtual vehicles which moving along with the predefined paths at the same surge speed 9 lim t η di θ i η i t δ i 1 10 lim t θ i v d i θ i δ i 2 11 lim t θ i θ j δ i 3 where η i is the position of the ith vessel v d i θ r is the speed assignment δ i 1 δ i 2 δ i 3 r are small constants 3 coordinated path following controller design the coordinated path following control for multiple underactuated vessels can be realized by two envelope control design see fig 2 for the individual path following envelop the nonlinear disturbance observer is first presented to reconstruct the information about the lumped disturbance which comprised of the environmental disturbance and model uncertainty then the observer based path following controller is designed for the individual vessel to follow its virtual vehicle with consideration of physical limitation for the coordinated path following envelop the speed agreement is developed to synchronize the surge speed of virtual vehicles based on the local information finally the coordinated path following for multiple underactuated vessels is realized with desired geometric pattern under the ingenious design of the two envelopes 3 1 construction of the dob in this section a novel dob is constructed to improve the disturbance rejection capability of the underactuated vessel by observing the lumped disturbance which includes the model uncertainty and environmental disturbance the designed dob is with the advantages of high observation accuracy and concise form define m ℓ i m ℓ i m ℓ i f ℓ i f ℓ i f ℓ i ℓ i u i v i r i m ℓ i f ℓ i are known nominal values of m ℓ i f ℓ i the ship dynamic can be re rewritten as 12 m ℓ i ℓ i f ℓ i τ ℓ i d f ℓ i where d f ℓ i τ w ℓ i m ℓ i ℓ i f ℓ i is the lumped disturbance design the dob as follows 13 d ˆ f ℓ i ξ ℓ i k o i m ℓ i ℓ i ξ ℓ i k o i ξ ℓ i k o i τ ℓ i k o i m ℓ i ℓ i f ℓ i where ξ ℓ i is the

is employed to model the information exchange between the underactuated vessels therefore the coordinated control law for vessel i is developed by its own state and the information from its neighbors for vessel i the coordinated control law can be designated as 39 ω i k 7 i 1 j g a i j θ i θ j ψ i γ i γ i k 7 i k 8 i γ i j g a i j θ i θ j ψ i where ω i θ i v d i θ i k 7 i r k 8 i r are positive

following results can be achieved 1 the constraint requirement on the vessel velocity 4 will not be violated during operation 2 error signals x e i y e i ψ e i ℓ e i ω i of the formation closed loop

result of the stability analysis means that all of the underactuated vessels in the formation coincide with their corresponding virtual vehicles moving along with parameterized paths i e the position requirement 9 and speed requirement 10 are satisfied the multiple vessel formation is well built and maintained since the along path synchronized motion of virtual vehicles are achieved i e the synchronization requirement 11 is satisfied 4 numerical simulations in this section numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated path following control algorithm for networked underactuated vessels the underactuated vessel cybership ii skjetne et al 2004 which is 1 25 m in length and 0 29 m in breadth is selected as the individual model of the ship formation system the detail physical parameters of the ship model can be referred from table 1 for the disturbance the time varying ocean environmental disturbance is modeled by triangle function and chosen as follows d w u i 11 12 1 0 35 sin 0 3 t 0 15 cos 0 5 t d w v i 26 17 76 1 0 3 sin 0 4 t 0 2 cos 0 1 t d w r i 950 636 1 0 3 sin 0 3 t 0 1 cos 0 5 t in this example a networked team of 5 identical underactuated marine vessels is considered as the control plant to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the presence of time varying disturbance the shrunk pentagon formation is developed according to the positions and orientations of virtual vehicles in 5 the scaling matrix is selected as follows s a 1 k t t 0 0 b 1 k t t where a b 1 k 0 7 t 120 main

plotted by red solid line in fig 3 for the underactuated formation system is defined as η 0 θ 0 θ 0 10 sin 0 1 θ 0 atan 2 cos 0 1 θ 0 t the offset vector from the ith reference path to the original reference path is defined as l i x d i θ i y d i θ i 10 sin 2 π i 1 n 10 cos 2 π i 1 n where i 1 2 n the laplacian matrix of the networked underactated ships is denoted as l 2 1 0 0 1 1 2 1 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 0 1 2 1 1 0 0 1 2 fig 3 shows the paths of the networked underactuated ships where the initial positions are chosen randomly as we can see the desired pentagon formation can be built and maintained well by underactuated ships under the proposed coordinated path following control algorithm meanwhile the shrinking pentagon formation is realized over time fig 4 shows that the position error and heading error of each ship to their virtual vehicles could converge to the neighborhood of the origin from fig 5 we can learn that the networked ships proceed along their predefined path at the same surge speed i e the velocities of the underactuated ships abide by the consensus agreement fig 6 shows the constrained control inputs of the underactuated ships and illustrate that the physical operation range of actuators will not be violated during the coordinated path following control task fig 7 shows that the lumped disturbance of ship formation system could be estimated well by the proposed observer 2 comparison simulation for individual ship in this section comparison simulation is conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed path following algorithm for individual ship the proposed algorithm plotted in blue solid line is compared with the robust adaptive formation control rafc plotted in red dash line algorithm in lu et al 2018 in the presence of time varying disturbance the reference path is generated by triangle function fig 8 indicates that the position error signals could converge to the neighborhood of the origin ultimately under both control algorithm with the consideration of physical limitation the proposed algorithm achieves better tracking performance than the rafc from fig 9 we can learn that the velocities are more steady under the proposed algorithm which contribute to less abrasion of actuators for the control inputs of individual ship fig 10 shows that the proposed control algorithm is satisfied with physical constraint requirement for further comparison two popular specifications are employed to evaluate the superiority of the algorithms quantitatively the simulation is conducted on the industrial pc with intel r core tm i7 6700 cpu 3 40 ghz and 8 gb ram detailed comparison is illustrated in table 2 where the integrated absolute error iae and integrated time absolute error itae are introduced to evaluate the transient and steady state performance i a e 0 t e i t d t i t a e 0 t t e i t d t where e i t denotes the position variables x e i y e i ψ e i of i the vessel it is obvious that the proposed algorithm achieves higher convergence accuracy than the rafc lu et al 2018 in both iae and itae therefore the proposed algorithm possessed better performance in path following control and disturbance rejection capability 5 conclusions this note addressed the coordinated path following control problem of multiple underactuated surface vessels in the presence of lumped disturbance and actuator constraint a novel dob is firstly proposed to reconstruct the information of lumped disturbance which includes the environmental disturbance and model uncertainty by fusion of the auxiliary system and blf the observer based path following controller is developed for individual vessel with the consideration of input and velocity constraints second a speed agreement is presented to ensure the motion synchronization of the ship formation system by the undirected graph rigorous theoretical analysis is proved to guarantee that all the closed loop signals are uniformly ultimately bounded

22183,principal stress rotation psr is one of the main stress conditions for a soil element subject to cyclic waves it is one of the main causes behind generation of excess pore water pressure and cumulative plastic strain in soil deposits when drainage conditions are impeded and thus compromises the stability of any supported marine structures this paper aims to investigate the influence of psr on the cyclic characteristics of soil under standing waves that are partially reflected in which a generalized plasticity model considering the effect of psr was adopted to model the soil behavior comparisons between the present model previous hollow cylinder apparatus tests and geotechnical centrifugal wave tests all show good agreement numerical results indicate that ignoring the psr involved in the standing wave seabed interactions will significantly underestimate the build up of pore water pressure particularly at the standing wave nodes furthermore the exclusion of the effect of psr may lead to contradictory results in terms of susceptibility to liquefaction between the antinode and the node when compared to the wave flume test and geotechnical centrifuge test numerical simulation results also demonstrate that while considering the impact of psr a sandy seabed exhibits higher liquefaction resistance when subjected to standing waves compared to the case when subjected to progressive waves with an equivalent wave height parametric studies show that the coefficient of wave reflection wave characteristics wave height period and water depth and soil properties permeability and saturation significantly affect the liquefaction characteristics of soil under partially reflected standing waves keywords standing wave sandy seabed partial reflection liquefaction general plasticity theory principal stress rotation 1 introduction over the past few decades numerous marine structures e g breakwaters pipelines caisson structures and oil platforms have been constructed in offshore areas due to the rapid development of worldwide offshore energy activities the foundation design of these structures encounters a series of difficulties due to the complexity of stress conditions for soil elements subject to cyclic waves as a typical wave forms in an oceanic environment a partially reflected standing wave commonly occurs in front of marine structures e g caisson type breakwaters rubble mound breakwaters with steep foreshore slope as a result of wave interference between the incident and reflected waves studies on soil responses induced by standing waves have been conducted for years mainly involving analytical approximations sekiguchi et al 1995 tsai 1995 jeng 1997 numerical modeling mase et al 1994 yang and ye 2017 ulker et al 2010 and physical experiments tsai and lee 1995 sassa and sekiguchi 1999 kirca et al 2013 among these sekiguchi et al 1995 derived a closed form analytical solution which considers one dimensional poro elastoplasticity to analyze the liquefaction characteristics of loosely deposited soils under a standing wave loading mase et al 1994 proposed a finite element model for calculating the soil response under the action of standing waves tsai 1995 evaluated the potential for momentary liquefaction in a poro elastic seabed which may be the only research on partially reflected standing waves in published literature tsai and lee 1995 performed experiments in a wave flume to investigate the soil response under fully reflected standing wave loading jeng 1997 presented an analytical solution for the standing wave induced soil response in a cross anisotropic seabed of infinite thickness for physical experiments sassa and sekiguchi 1999 conducted a range of centrifugal wave tank tests to investigate the behavior of a fine grained sand seabed under progressive wave loading and standing wave loading the results showed that the liquefaction potential under progressive wave loading was much stronger than that under standing wave loading when the standing wave loading was identical in magnitude to the progressive wave height especially at the antinode kirca et al 2013 performed several experiments in a wave flume to study the liquefaction characteristics of a seabed beneath standing waves they found that the pore water pressure was most likely to accumulate at the node owing to significant wave induced shear strain and then propagate toward the antinode recently yang and ye 2017 tried to apply a generalized plasticity model the pastor zienkiewicz model mark iii pziii initially proposed by zienkiewicz and mroz 1984 and later extended to soils by pastor et al 1990 to capture the cyclic characteristics of loose seabed floors under a standing wave loading their simulated results showed that liquefaction at the antinode occurred prior to liquefaction at the node which was contradictory to the experimental findings kirca et al 2013 sassa and sekiguchi 1999 discussed above a possible reason is that the original pziii model neglects the deformation induced by principal stress rotation psr and therefore is incapable of capturing the liquefaction characteristics of the seabed foundation under standing waves especially at the standing wave nodes where the wave induced shear strains are the most significant when ocean waves propagate over a porous seabed the magnitudes of principal stresses in the soil element are cyclically altered this may further lead to a continuous rotation of the principal stress orientation due to the alternating changeover of the horizontal shear stress and the stress difference between the vertical and horizontal normal stresses in general the deformation characteristics of the soil deposits are primarily related to the change in the principal stress direction and its magnitude in particular may be purely related to the psr even without a change in the principal stress magnitude under wave loading ishihara and towhata 1983 continuous psr can also generate excess pore water pressure and cumulative plastic strain when the drainage condition is impeded towhata and ishihara 1985 nakata et al 1998 sassa and sekiguchi 1999 jafarian et al 2012 konstadinou and georgiannou 2013 xiao et al 2014 wang et al 2017 such an effect has not been considered in most previous studies on liquefaction around marine infrastructure in the literature tsai 1995 yoshimine et al 1998 sumer et al 2012 guo et al 2014 ye et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 leng et al 2018 liao et al 2018 2019 zhao et al 2017 understanding the effects of psr on the mechanism of wave seabed interactions could be beneficial for offshore geotechnical engineers involved in marine foundation design based on experimental results for monotonic loading symes et al 1984 and cyclic rotational shear tests towhata and ishihara 1985 as well as geotechnical centrifugal wave tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 sassa and sekiguchi 2001 proposed a modified version of pziii that considers the impact of psr in which the loading functions plastic potential functions and plastic modulus were defined with a new major principal stress angle parameter ψ however this model only uses two dimensional mean effective stress and maximum shear stress as stress variables but neglects out of plane stress despite its importance for determining plastic flow conditions perić and ayari 2002a 2002b rodriguez and lade 2014 moreover the major principal stress angle ψ is not a stress tensor invariant so it may not be reasonable for sassa and sekiguchi 2001 to have considered the effect of psr by taking the derivative of the plastic flow and loading function with respect to ψ therefore zhu et al 2019 developed a novel constitutive model which considers psr in which the psr induced plastic soil deformation is considered independently li et al 2011 and the relationship between the normalized loading direction and the plastic flow direction is established solely with the stress tensor invariants in the present research the effects of psr on the susceptibility to liquefaction of a sandy seabed under partially reflected standing waves is investigated by adopting the constitutive model developed by zhu et al 2019 the difference in the cyclic characteristics of the soil beneath standing waves and progressive waves while considering the impact of psr is also investigated finally the sensitivity of wave induced soil liquefaction to the coefficient of wave reflection the parameters of the soil and the parameters of the waves are analyzed through a parametric study 2 theoretical formulations 2 1 seabed model in this study biot s u p approximation biot 1956 in two dimensions under plane strain idealization is adopted to demonstrate the

from triaxial tests with small strain measurement zienkiewicz et al 1998 for a more detailed description of the modified pziii model with psr the readers can refer to zhu et al 2019 since a sandy seabed will become increasingly dense when subjected to long term wave loading in each time step the void ratio e and corresponding permeability coefficient k s of the seabed soil are assumed to be modified as follows miyamoto et al 2004 18 e n 1 1 e n exp β s δ p δ ε v 1 k s n 1 k s 0 e 0 3 1 e 0 e n 1 3 1 e n 1 where e n 1 and e n are void ratios at the n 1 th and n th time steps respectively δ ε v is the incremental volume strain of the soil δp is the incremental pore water pressure k sn 1 is the permeability coefficient of seabed soil at the n 1 th time step and k s0 is the initial condition and e 0 is the initial void ratio 2 2 boundary conditions to solve the boundary value problem involved in wave seabed interactions the following initial and boundary conditions were set as shown in fig 1 a both lateral sea side boundaries of the seabed are fixed in the horizontal direction b zero soil displacement is assumed for soil resting on an impermeable rigid base and pore water pressure is applied with zero gradient boundary conditions and c at the mudline the pore water pressure is equal to the wave induced dynamic water pressure which is dependent on the wave types such as partially reflected standing wave and progressive wave and no soil displacement constraints are considered 2 3 integration model of a wave and a porous seabed as displayed in fig 2 based on the wave parameters the analytical or numerical wave is first generated and propagated along the extension direction of the seabed surface and exerts dynamic water pressure on the seabed surface then the one way coupling methodology is adopted by equating the pore water pressure to the wave induced dynamic water pressure after the data exchange between the wave model and soil model the dynamic response of the sandy seabed under wave loading including pore water pressure effective stress shear stress volumetric strain and shear strain can ultimately be addressed in accordance with the elastic or elasto plastic model of soil within the framework of the fem 3 verifications 3 1 hollow cylinder apparatus element test within the framework of diana swandyne ii the module sm2d focuses on testing a developed constitutive soil model chan 1995 here a hollow cylinder apparatus hca element test concerning pure psr conducted by towhata and ishihara 1985 was adopted to validate the reliability of the present constitutive model developed by zhu et al 2019 in which the test material is japanese standard sand i e toyoura sand with its corresponding constitutive model parameters listed in table 1 in the hca test both the deviator stress σ 1 σ 3 2 and the amplitude of the shear stress were held constant at 65 1 kpa and the direction of the major principal stress ψ was rotated continuously with ψ ranging from 0 to π with a circular stress path as shown in fig 3 the stress path simulated by sm2d also follows a circle with a 65 1 kpa radius which agrees well with the aimed stress path of the hca test consequently the hca test concerning pure psr can be well reproduced by sm2d fig 4 shows the p ψ relationship of the soil element when subject to the undrained shear test concerning the pure psr it can be clearly seen that there is a remarkable decrease in the mean effective stress p under continuous pure rotation in the principal stress direction it is also found that the simulated results show good agreement with the measured data indicating that psr induced deformation can be well captured using the present model 3 2 geotechnical centrifuge tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 carried out geotechnical centrifuge tests to understand the liquefaction characteristics of a sandy seabed under different types of waves including progressive and standing waves to verify the present model an identical case used by sassa and sekiguchi will be reproduced in this section using the developed model both simulated results under progressive and standing waves will be compared with the centrifuge tests the parameters of the wave and soil used in the validation are given in table 2 in the centrifuge test a bed of saturated loose leighton buzzard sand subjected to sinusoidal wave loading with one wave length l and one wave period t is considered sassa and sekiguchi 1999 all these wave tests were performed under a steady state centrifugal acceleration of 50 g the soil bed is 200 mm in width and 100 mm in depth as shown in fig 5 the boundary condition has already been applied in section 2 3 the pore water pressure at the mudline is equal to the wave induced dynamic water pressure which is dependent on the type of wave loading here the submerged unit weight of the soil γ was equal to 425 kn m3 and the wave number κ 2π l was 12 2 m 1 the soil tension is assumed to be positive in both progressive and standing wave cases 3 2 1 progressive wave loading first a linear sinusoidal progressive wave was applied on the seabed as a pressure boundary condition of the following form ye and jeng 2011 19 σ z p e p b x 0 t p 0 cos κ x ω t τ x z 0 at z 0 where p b is the dynamic wave pressure at the seabed surface p 0 γ w h 2cosh κd is the amplitude of the wave pressure at the seabed surface h is the wave height d is the water depth and ω 2π t is the angular frequency of the waves as demonstrated by jeng and zhao 2015 there is no significant discrepancy in the horizontal distribution of accumulated pore pressure in the case of progressive waves as an example the centerline with a centroid at z 15 mm marked as point d in fig 5 is taken as the representative location for verification of the responses of a soil element as listed in table 3 a total of eight cases of progressive wave loading are used to investigate the maximum residual pore pressures p max under different cyclic stress ratios χ 0 p 0 κ γ the associated results marked in red line predicted by the present model are shown in fig 6 in which the centrifugal wave tank test data for loose leighton buzzard sand sassa and sekiguchi 1999 marked with the solid circles are also depicted for comparison as seen the predicted curve of the present model show good consistency with the measured values of p max σ v 0 and χ 0 under progressive wave loading the maximum residual pore pressure p max shows s shaped growth with the increase of the cyclic stress ratio χ 0 when χ 0 is equal to or greater than 0 14 the ratio p max σ v 0 approaches unity which implies that liquefaction occurs as observed in the centrifuge tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 3 2 2 standing wave loading to further validate the feasibility of the integrated model the soil responses under ten cyclic stress ratios in the case of standing wave loading shown in table 4 are presented with comparison to the measured results of sassa and sekiguchi 1999 as shown in fig 7 the numerical setup is identical to the experimental one with the same boundary conditions as the progressive wave case except that the pressure boundary condition at the mudline is expressed as follows 20 σ z p e p b x 0 t p 0 cos κ x cos ω t τ x z 0 at z 0 fig 8 shows the measured values of p max σ v 0 and χ 0 in the centrifugal standing wave tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 in which the predicted curves of the present model are also illustrated for comparison as can be seen the simulated results show good consistency with the centrifuge tests especially near the standing wave nodes similar to the findings for the progressive waves the p max also shows s shaped growth with an increase of the cyclic stress ratio χ 0 as observed in the centrifuge tests liquefaction occurs when χ 0 is equal to or greater than 0 2 and the ratio p max σ v 0 approaches unity unfortunately the predicted soil responses for the antinode are much less than the measured ones which are similar to the predicted results from sassa and sekiguchi 2001 this is likely attributable to the lateral soil movement in the sediment trench during the centrifuge test owing to its limited length which gives rise to pore pressure accumulation at both lateral sides close to the standing wave nodes and subsequently affects the performance of the antinode in the middle test section 4 application after validation the model was extended to a real scale and applied for the standing wave seabed interactions in the computation the incident wave was assumed to be partially reflected forming a series of partial standing waves in front of a breakwater as shown in fig 1 the corresponding dynamic pressure generated at the seafloor which was simplified from a 3d short crested wave tsai 1995 to a 2d standing wave with some algebraic manipulation can be determined in the following form 21 σ z τ x z 0 σ z p e p 0 1 r cos κ x cos ω t 1 r sin κ x sin ω t at z 0 where p 0 p 0 γ w h i 2cosh κd is the amplitude of the wave pressure at the seabed surface h i is the height of the incident wave κ 2π l is the wave number equal to 0 0887 m 1 and l 70 873 m is the length of the incident wave r is the coefficient of wave reflection in this study the following wave parameters in table 5 were used in the numerical examples the seabed was filled with loose leighton buzzard sand and the associated parameters for the present model are presented in table 2 the model parameters for the original pziii model can be also found in table 2 with a b 0 the seabed s saturation thickness and length were listed in table 5 for the computation of the nonlinear standing wave the line of symmetry x 0 m was located underneath the antinode the computational results of two lines x 0 m located at the antinode and x 17 7 m located at the node are taken as representative of the dynamics of loose seabed soil beneath a standing wave the initial conditions were determined from a pre consolidation analysis of the seabed foundation under gravitational forces tension is considered to be positive in this study the stress state in the final consolidation was taken as the initial condition for the following dynamic analysis to further demonstrate the effects of psr on the wave induced soil response the simulated results from the original pziii model are also incorporated into the analysis for comparison 4 1 variation of seabed response under partially reflected standing waves figs 9 and 10 show the time history of pore water pressure and vertical effective stress at the standing wave antinode and node respectively the results indicate that the model is capable of reproducing the elasto plastic behavior of the sandy seabed under cyclic wave loading involving the rotation of principal stress axes the predicted results are consistent with experimental findings in wave flume kirca et al 2013 and geotechnical centrifuge tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 in which the pore water pressure not surprisingly is more likely to build up and accumulate to a large value at the standing wave node as compared to at the antinode psr induced deformations become increasingly pronounced at the standing wave node owing to the large shear strain induced by the waves which subsequently enhances the plastic strain and build up of the pore pressure in the area on the other hand the original pziii ignores the effects of psr and significantly underestimates the build up of the pore pressure and the reduction of the vertical effective stress in the seabed foundation particularly at the standing wave node at the antinode no rotation in the major principal stress direction is involved and hence no significant difference in the dynamic soil response between the two models can be observed in the region it can also be observed that the cyclic amplitudes of p e are negatively related to the buried depth of the seabed because the transmission of wave loading always shows a progressive attenuation as the buried depth of the seabed increases however the residual pore pressure p e 2 zen and yamazaki 1990 sumer 2014 is more likely to build up in deeper areas z h 0 5 or 0 9 this is due to the fact that the pore water near the seabed surface can drain out from the soil and is therefore less likely to build up in this region in addition at the antinode the discrepancy of the accumulation of p e 2 predicted by the present model and the original pziii is not apparent especially at a shallow buried depth such as location a with z h 0 1 as shown in fig 1 the p e 2 increases with increasing embedment depth whereas at the standing wave nodes regardless of the embedment depth the discrepancy of p e 2 between the two models is significant during the whole computation fig 11 shows snapshots of the dynamic pore pressure at times t 10t and t 45t predicted by the present model and the original pziii it can be observed that the effects of psr on the wave induced soil response are significant giving rise to a larger build up of pore pressure in the present model over the original pziii particularly at the standing wave node in the early loading stage the cumulative plastic strain and subsequent build up of pore pressure in the seabed foundation mainly comes from the wave induced hydro dynamic water pressures acting on the seabed which are most significant at the antinode of the standing wave consequently for both models the seabed foundation which is located at the antinode is the area where the pore water pressure is most likely to build up in the first several loading periods i e t 10t as the wave repetition increases in the present model the effect of psr on the cyclic behavior of the seabed at the standing wave node becomes increasingly important dominating the accumulation of pore water pressure in the area even causing it to exceed the accumulation at the antinode after 45 wave repetitions for the original pziii neglecting the effect of psr the pore pressure at the antinode is always greater than that at the node throughout the whole computation this further confirms the necessity of including psr in numerical simulations of standing wave and seabed interactions otherwise the simulation may lead to contradictory predictions ye et al 2015 yang and ye 2017 a stress path is another way to characterize the liquefaction susceptibility of the seabed under cyclic waves fig 12 shows the effective stress paths at six monitored points marked as points a b and c for line x 0 and a b and c for line x 17 7 m in fig 1 in the seabed foundation under a partially reflected standing wave it is observed that there is a high rate of decrease in p and q at point a and a predicted by the present model until p reaches zero and the soil liquefies the model also predicts a similar trend at other locations however according to the original pziii model the sandy seabed is far from reaching the liquefaction point as p at all the monitored points is greater than zero during the whole computation the effect of psr is well reflected in the marked reduction in the mean effective stress as described above it can also be observed that the results predicted by the present model show a more significant reduction of p at the node compared to at the antinode which is contradictory to the prediction of the original pziii moreover the reduction of p predicted by the original pziii model at the antinode is quicker than that at the node at a deeper buried depth under partially reflected standing waves the predicted deviatoric stress paths in both models show a series of smooth ellipses as shown in fig 13 in addition a remarkable decrease in the deviatoric stress and a progressive liquefaction tendency can be anticipated σ z σ x however the reduction speed predicted by the present model shown as the blue solid line is quicker than the simulated results of the original pziii model shown as the red dashed line especially at the standing wave node for wave induced shear stress however at all soil depths there is no significant discrepancy between the predictions the accumulation of τ xz at the antinode is far less than that at the node which results in a smaller major principal stress angle ψ seen in eq 9 at the antinode therefore the rate of reduction in the deviatoric stress at the node is apparently quicker than that at the antinode as shown in fig 13 cyclic mobility plays an important role in characterizing the soil behavior under wave loading when the present model is adopted the soil behaves similarly to the predictions of the original pziii model at the early stage at the node and during the whole process at the antinode however after specific wave cycles there is a remarkable increase in shear strain at the node predicted by the present model unfortunately the degradation of the shear stiffness at the node cannot be observed in the simulated results of the original pziii model it also can be observed that the development of shear strain predicted by the present model at the node is stronger than that at the antinode because of the effect of psr as introduced earlier the angle of orientation ψ is a key parameter for differentiating the present model and the original pziii in terms of psr induced shear deformations the effects of psr on the standing wave induced soil response can be demonstrated somewhat in the time variations of ψ as shown in fig 14 as seen not surprisingly there is not a large effect of psr at the antinode owing to the small shear strain induced by the waves hence the amplitude of ψ shows little difference between the present model and the original pziii whereas at the wave node the discrepancy is much more obvious especially at deeper locations where the wave induced shear strain is significant the amplitude of ψ predicted by the present model shows a more significant increase when compared with the original pziii which in turn affects the plastic soil deformation and subsequent build up of pore pressure the results further confirm that ignoring the psr induced deformations will significantly underestimate the instability of soil under partially reflected standing waves especially at the node 4 2 progressive liquefaction it has been well recognized that loose sand deposits are likely to become compacted when subject to cyclic shearing i e waves earthquakes or structural vibrations due to the drainage of pore water and the pore pressure tends to accumulate when the drainage condition is impeded during this process the soil skeleton continuously loses its inter granular contact and liquefies when the accumulated pore pressure overcomes the overburdened soil weight here the residual liquefaction potential denoted l p is defined to demonstrate the liquefaction characteristics of a sandy seabed ye et al 2015 22 l p σ z d σ z 0 where σ z d σ z σ z 0 is the wave induced vertical effective stress and σ z and σ z 0 are the current and initial effective stresses respectively okusa 1985 proposed a criterion of liquefaction based on the vertical effective stress σ z 0 and σ z d 23 σ z d σ z 0 according to okusa s liquefaction criterion eq 23 the sandy soil liquefies only when l p is equal to or greater than 1 0 however the value of l p in sandy soil cannot exceed 1 0 in laboratory tests ishihara 1993 wu et al 2004 or numerical simulations ye and jeng 2012 because sandy soil lacks cohesion and unlike silty or clay soil cannot bear any tensile stress wu et al 2004 suggested that sandy soil can be considered liquefied when l p is equal to or greater than 0 78 0 99 in this study the loose leighton buzzard sand is considered to be liquefied when l p is equal to or greater than 0 86 ye et al 2015 fig 15 shows the vertical distribution characteristics of residual pore pressure predicted by the present model and the original pziii model at different times here l r represents the liquefaction resistance line of sandy soil which is equal to 0 86 σ z 0 as seen in the figure p e 2 increases with increasing wave repetitions and approaches the liquefaction resistance line but is incapable of exceeding it liquefaction occurs when p e 2 l r it is found that the liquefaction potential exhibits a significant difference between the present model and the original pziii the current model shows liquefaction is more likely to be observed at the standing wave node owing to the significant wave induced shear strain and the associated psrs rather than at the antinode the original pziii shows the opposite prediction which is contradictory to the experimental findings in the wave flume test kirca et al 2013 and geotechnical wave test sassa and sekiguchi 1999 the main reason is that the original pziii neglects psr induced deformations which significantly underestimate the liquefaction resistance of the sandy seabed at the standing wave node ye et al 2015 yang and ye 2017 leading to unsafe engineering designs 4 3 comparison of standing waves and progressive waves in this section the difference between the dynamic response of the seabed to progressive and standing waves is further investigated by adopting the developed model in the computation the seabed is again considered to be loose leighton buzzard sand sassa and sekiguchi 1999 with the characteristics displayed in table 2 furthermore the boundary condition is the same as that defined in section 2 3 except that a linear progressive wave as shown in eq 19 is applied on the seabed as a pressure boundary condition six representative soil elements as shown in fig 1 on the centerline x 0 and the line x 17 7 m at z h 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 were chosen to study the soil responses under different types of wave loading to ensure a robust comparison a fully reflected standing wave r 1 with identical peak wave components to the progressive wave is used in the calculation the boundary condition is also the same as that illustrated in section 2 3 except that the pressure boundary condition applied on the seabed is a fully reflected standing wave as shown in eq 21 with r 1 the parameters for both the progressive wave and the fully reflected standing wave are listed in table 6 fig 16 shows snapshots of the accumulated pore pressure of the different wave types at the times t 10t and t 22t it was again observed that the standing wave induced pore pressure is strongly dependent on the x direction peaking in the area underneath the standing wave nodes and reaching a minimum at the antinodes as discussed previously whereas no significant difference in the horizontal distribution of the dynamic pore pressure can be observed under progressive waves this is likely attributable to the moveable nature of the progressive wave since the amplitude of each point of a propagating wave is the same as the wave induced shear strain and the rotation of the principal stress axes are uniform in the seabed foundation as shown in fig 17 there is an obvious difference in the soil responses between the two types of waves especially at the antinode such as the accumulation of pore pressure and liquefaction potential first of all as shown in fig 17 because of the static characteristic of the standing wave loading the development of the residual pore pressure p e 2 with depth at the node is quite different from that at the antinode during the first five wave cycles the development of p e 2 at the antinode is stronger than at the node however after 15t a reverse occurs at a shallow depth where the speed of liquefaction becomes much faster at the node than that at the antinode as shown in fig 17 this is due to the fact that p e 2 at the antinode is mainly produced by the vertical cyclic wave pressure without psr occurring at the location as illustrated earlier in fig 14 however results show that there is only shear stress applied at the node and the accumulation of p e 2 there is mainly dependent on the psr as shown in fig 14 the development of the major principal stress angle ψ is positively related to the wave cycles therefore the effect of psr is very limited at the first five wave cycles and the build up of p e 2 at the node is less than that at the antinode after a certain period of time 15t in this case the effect of psr is so strong that the amplitude of p e 2 at the node exceeds that at the antinode at the shallow depth after approximately 17t the sandy seabed at the node begins to liquefy and eventually reaches a liquefied depth of 8 m however the sandy seabed at the antinode does not liquefy until 22t and reaches a corresponding liquefied depth of 3 5 m which is less than half of that at the node moreover at the middle and bottom depths of the seabed the accumulation of p e 2 at the antinode is stronger than that at the node this is due to the fact that the development of ψ is negatively related to the buried depth as shown in fig 14 the effect of psr is inferior to the vertical wave pressure which leads the middle and bottom depths having a lower amplitude of p e 2 at the node than at the antinode there is no obvious difference in the characteristics of progressive liquefaction between the node and the antinode for progressive wave loading in which the symbol presents the location in progressive wave is associated with the node and antinode in fully reflected standing wave rather than the true node and antinode this is due to the moveable characteristic of the progressive wave any location along the seabed undergoes the same loading which has the coupled effects of the vertical wave pressure and shear stress therefore even at the node the liquefied depth and the speed of liquefaction under fully reflected standing wave loading are much less than those under progressive wave loading during the same time period 4 4 parametric studies from the above comparison it can be found that there is a significant distinction between the predicted dynamic responses of sandy soil at the antinodes and at the nodes under partial standing wave loading in this section the sensitivity analysis on the coefficient of wave reflection r wave parameters incident wave height hi wave period t water depth d and seabed characteristics saturability sr permeability coefficient ks0 is addressed in which the baseline values of model parameters of seabed were displayed in table 2 and the reference values of wave and seabed parameters were listed in table 5 the parameter r which can range from 0 to 1 is an important factor to control the reflection efficiency of a progressive wave acting on a marine structure on the one hand if r 0 no reflection occurs and the wave will have the characteristics of a progressive wave on the other hand if r 1 a full reflection occurs and the wave will have the characteristics of a fully reflected standing wave as discussed above the soil response under progressive wave loading is different from that under standing wave loading therefore it is necessary to examine the effect of r on the progressive liquefaction process as illustrated in fig 18 both the speed and depth of liquefaction at the antinode and the node are positive with every value of r in which the region on left and right side of the liquefication depth curve present the no liquefaction and liquefied zone respectively this is because the wave intensity is dependent on the value of parameter r as shown in eq 21 a larger value of the wave intensity leads to an easier liquefaction of the sandy seabed moreover it can also be observed that the liquefaction response at the node is stronger than that at the antinode for most values of r shown in fig 18 the influence of the wave and seabed characteristics on the liquefaction process of a sandy seabed under partially reflected wave loading are shown in fig 19 and fig 20 respectively the most significant wave characteristic is the incident wave height hi shown in fig 19 after 15 time periods of cyclic wave loading the depths of liquefaction at the node and the antinode approach 10 m and 8 m respectively for hi 3 m while no liquefaction occurs at the node or the antinode for hi 1 m in addition both the partial standing wave induced liquefaction depths at the node and the antinode have a positive relationship to the wave height of the incident wave and the wave period but they show a negative relationship to the water depth as shown in fig 20 both the permeability and the saturation of the soil have a significant influence on the liquefaction of the sandy soil it appears that no liquefaction occurs in a very loose seabed when the permeability coefficient ks0 is greater than 1 5 10 2 m s this is because of the fast dissipation of pore pressure in the seabed the maximum liquefaction depth increases with a reduction in ks0 which demonstrates a negative relationship between liquefaction depth and ks0 however the difference is not distinct when ks0 is less than 1 5 10 5 m s therefore the influence of ks0 on the liquefaction depth of sandy soil is limited in a certain range in addition the liquefaction depth is positively related to the saturation of the sandy soil this is because the pure fluid in unsaturated sandy soil always displays significant compressibility because of the presence of gas moreover the liquefaction depth at the node is much greater than that at the antinode for the same wave and seabed characteristics as shown in figs 19 and 20 5 conclusions soil liquefaction in sandy seabed under partially reflected standing waves has become a concern because of its potential weaken effects on the resistance of sediment and the stability of breakwaters seawalls and large caisson structures as an important characteristic of the dynamic response of soil under cyclic wave loading the effect of principal stress rotation psr should be considered in the numerical analysis of wave seabed interaction in this study a modified version of pastor zienkiewicz model mark iii pziii with psr was adopted for investigating the stress strain behavior of sandy soil under wave loading the focus of this study was the effects of psr on the liquefaction potential of interactions between partially reflected standing waves and a seabed based on the numerical examples the following conclusions can be drawn 1 for partially reflected wave loading both the predicted results of the present model and the original pziii model show that the development of the dynamic response under the antinode and the node are negatively related to the buried depth however a large discrepancy between the two models was found for the development of excess pore pressure vertical effective stress the angle of psr and the speed and scale of progressive liquefaction moreover the effects of psr on the liquefaction susceptibility of sandy soils are concentrated in the region under the standing wave node at the antinodes where there is no psr the difference in the predicted soil response between the two models is not significant 2 the predicted results of the original pziii model show that the development of the liquefaction potential around the antinode is always stronger than that around the node this is inconsistent with the experimental results of kirca et al 2013 the simulated results of the present model indicate that the development of the liquefaction potential around the antinodes is stronger than that around the nodes during the initial phase of the experiment however this phenomenon will reverse after a certain period of time owing to the effect of psr therefore it is important to consider the effect of psr in any numerical analysis of the soil response under partially reflected standing wave loading otherwise it will result in discrepancies in the liquefied response such as the liquefied depth and speed of liquefaction between the antinode and the node which is extremely dangerous in practical coastal and offshore engineering 3 the soil response of a loose sandy seabed is dependent on the loading characteristics of the wave for standing wave loading the residual pore pressure p e 2 at the antinode is mainly produced by the vertical cyclic wave pressure with no effect from psr however there is only shear stress existing at the node and the accumulation of p e 2 is mainly dependent on the psr which causes the speed of liquefaction at the node to be much faster than at the antinode for progressive wave loading there is no obvious difference in the characteristics of progressive liquefaction between the node and the antinode because of its moveable nature in addition the liquefaction potential under progressive wave loading is stronger than that under standing wave loading especially at the antinode 4 parametric studies show that the coefficient of wave reflection has a significant influence on the development of progressive liquefaction at the node and the antinode in a sandy seabed additionally the wave induced liquefaction depth has in general a positive relationship with the incident wave height and the wave period but it shows a negative relationship with the water depth the properties of the soil also have a remarkable influence on the liquefaction depth of sandy soil therefore liquefaction is more likely to be observed in a fully saturated seabed when drainage conditions are impeded acknowledgement the national nature fund of china grant nos 51879133 51409142 41502285 51909077 the nature fund

22183,principal stress rotation psr is one of the main stress conditions for a soil element subject to cyclic waves it is one of the main causes behind generation of excess pore water pressure and cumulative plastic strain in soil deposits when drainage conditions are impeded and thus compromises the stability of any supported marine structures this paper aims to investigate the influence of psr on the cyclic characteristics of soil under standing waves that are partially reflected in which a generalized plasticity model considering the effect of psr was adopted to model the soil behavior comparisons between the present model previous hollow cylinder apparatus tests and geotechnical centrifugal wave tests all show good agreement numerical results indicate that ignoring the psr involved in the standing wave seabed interactions will significantly underestimate the build up of pore water pressure particularly at the standing wave nodes furthermore the exclusion of the effect of psr may lead to contradictory results in terms of susceptibility to liquefaction between the antinode and the node when compared to the wave flume test and geotechnical centrifuge test numerical simulation results also demonstrate that while considering the impact of psr a sandy seabed exhibits higher liquefaction resistance when subjected to standing waves compared to the case when subjected to progressive waves with an equivalent wave height parametric studies show that the coefficient of wave reflection wave characteristics wave height period and water depth and soil properties permeability and saturation significantly affect the liquefaction characteristics of soil under partially reflected standing waves keywords standing wave sandy seabed partial reflection liquefaction general plasticity theory principal stress rotation 1 introduction over the past few decades numerous marine structures e g breakwaters pipelines caisson structures and oil platforms have been constructed in offshore areas due to the rapid development of worldwide offshore energy activities the foundation design of these structures encounters a series of difficulties due to the complexity of stress conditions for soil elements subject to cyclic waves as a typical wave forms in an oceanic environment a partially reflected standing wave commonly occurs in front of marine structures e g caisson type breakwaters rubble mound breakwaters with steep foreshore slope as a result of wave interference between the incident and reflected waves studies on soil responses induced by standing waves have been conducted for years mainly involving analytical approximations sekiguchi et al 1995 tsai 1995 jeng 1997 numerical modeling mase et al 1994 yang and ye 2017 ulker et al 2010 and physical experiments tsai and lee 1995 sassa and sekiguchi 1999 kirca et al 2013 among these sekiguchi et al 1995 derived a closed form analytical solution which considers one dimensional poro elastoplasticity to analyze the liquefaction characteristics of loosely deposited soils under a standing wave loading mase et al 1994 proposed a finite element model for calculating the soil response under the action of standing waves tsai 1995 evaluated the potential for momentary liquefaction in a poro elastic seabed which may be the only research on partially reflected standing waves in published literature tsai and lee 1995 performed experiments in a wave flume to investigate the soil response under fully reflected standing wave loading jeng 1997 presented an analytical solution for the standing wave induced soil response in a cross anisotropic seabed of infinite thickness for physical experiments sassa and sekiguchi 1999 conducted a range of centrifugal wave tank tests to investigate the behavior of a fine grained sand seabed under progressive wave loading and standing wave loading the results showed that the liquefaction potential under progressive wave loading was much stronger than that under standing wave loading when the standing wave loading was identical in magnitude to the progressive wave height especially at the antinode kirca et al 2013 performed several experiments in a wave flume to study the liquefaction characteristics of a seabed beneath standing waves they found that the pore water pressure was most likely to accumulate at the node owing to significant wave induced shear strain and then propagate toward the antinode recently yang and ye 2017 tried to apply a generalized plasticity model the pastor zienkiewicz model mark iii pziii initially proposed by zienkiewicz and mroz 1984 and later extended to soils by pastor et al 1990 to capture the cyclic characteristics of loose seabed floors under a standing wave loading their simulated results showed that liquefaction at the antinode occurred prior to liquefaction at the node which was contradictory to the experimental findings kirca et al 2013 sassa and sekiguchi 1999 discussed above a possible reason is that the original pziii model neglects the deformation induced by principal stress rotation psr and therefore is incapable of capturing the liquefaction characteristics of the seabed foundation under standing waves especially at the standing wave nodes where the wave induced shear strains are the most significant when ocean waves propagate over a porous seabed the magnitudes of principal stresses in the soil element are cyclically altered this may further lead to a continuous rotation of the principal stress orientation due to the alternating changeover of the horizontal shear stress and the stress difference between the vertical and horizontal normal stresses in general the deformation characteristics of the soil deposits are primarily related to the change in the principal stress direction and its magnitude in particular may be purely related to the psr even without a change in the principal stress magnitude under wave loading ishihara and towhata 1983 continuous psr can also generate excess pore water pressure and cumulative plastic strain when the drainage condition is impeded towhata and ishihara 1985 nakata et al 1998 sassa and sekiguchi 1999 jafarian et al 2012 konstadinou and georgiannou 2013 xiao et al 2014 wang et al 2017 such an effect has not been considered in most previous studies on liquefaction around marine infrastructure in the literature tsai 1995 yoshimine et al 1998 sumer et al 2012 guo et al 2014 ye et al 2018 zhu et al 2017 leng et al 2018 liao et al 2018 2019 zhao et al 2017 understanding the effects of psr on the mechanism of wave seabed interactions could be beneficial for offshore geotechnical engineers involved in marine foundation design based on experimental results for monotonic loading symes et al 1984 and cyclic rotational shear tests towhata and ishihara 1985 as well as geotechnical centrifugal wave tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 sassa and sekiguchi 2001 proposed a modified version of pziii that considers the impact of psr in which the loading functions plastic potential functions and plastic modulus were defined with a new major principal stress angle parameter ψ however this model only uses two dimensional mean effective stress and maximum shear stress as stress variables but neglects out of plane stress despite its importance for determining plastic flow conditions perić and ayari 2002a 2002b rodriguez and lade 2014 moreover the major principal stress angle ψ is not a stress tensor invariant so it may not be reasonable for sassa and sekiguchi 2001 to have considered the effect of psr by taking the derivative of the plastic flow and loading function with respect to ψ therefore zhu et al 2019 developed a novel constitutive model which considers psr in which the psr induced plastic soil deformation is considered independently li et al 2011 and the relationship between the normalized loading direction and the plastic flow direction is established solely with the stress tensor invariants in the present research the effects of psr on the susceptibility to liquefaction of a sandy seabed under partially reflected standing waves is investigated by adopting the constitutive model developed by zhu et al 2019 the difference in the cyclic characteristics of the soil beneath standing waves and progressive waves while considering the impact of psr is also investigated finally the sensitivity of wave induced soil liquefaction to the coefficient of wave reflection the parameters of the soil and the parameters of the waves are analyzed through a

from triaxial tests with small strain measurement zienkiewicz et al 1998 for a more detailed description of the modified pziii model with psr the readers can refer to zhu et al 2019 since a sandy seabed will become increasingly dense when subjected to long term wave loading in each time step the void ratio e and corresponding permeability coefficient k s of the seabed soil are assumed to be modified as follows miyamoto et al 2004 18 e n 1 1 e n exp β s δ p δ ε v 1 k s n 1 k s 0 e 0 3 1 e 0 e n 1 3 1 e n 1 where e n 1 and e n are void ratios at the n 1 th and n th time steps respectively δ ε v is the incremental volume strain of the soil δp is the incremental pore water pressure k sn 1 is the permeability coefficient of seabed soil at the n 1 th time step and k s0 is the initial condition and e 0 is the initial void ratio 2 2 boundary conditions to solve the boundary value problem involved in wave seabed interactions the following initial and boundary conditions were set as shown in fig 1 a both lateral sea side boundaries of the seabed are fixed in the horizontal direction b zero soil displacement is assumed for soil resting on an impermeable rigid base and pore water pressure is applied with zero gradient boundary conditions and c at the mudline the pore water pressure is equal to the wave induced dynamic water pressure which is dependent on the wave types such as partially reflected standing wave and progressive wave and no soil displacement constraints are considered 2 3 integration model of a wave and a porous seabed as displayed in fig 2 based on the wave parameters the analytical or numerical wave is first generated and propagated along the extension direction of the seabed surface and exerts dynamic water pressure on the seabed surface then the one way coupling methodology is adopted by equating the pore water pressure to the wave induced dynamic water pressure after the data exchange between the wave model and soil model the dynamic response of the sandy seabed under wave loading including pore water pressure effective stress shear stress volumetric strain and shear strain can ultimately be addressed in accordance with the elastic or elasto plastic model of soil within the framework of the fem 3 verifications 3 1 hollow cylinder apparatus element test within the framework of diana swandyne ii the module sm2d focuses on testing a developed constitutive soil model chan 1995 here a hollow cylinder apparatus hca element test concerning pure psr conducted by towhata and ishihara 1985 was adopted to validate the reliability of the present constitutive model developed by zhu et al 2019 in which the test material is japanese standard sand i e toyoura sand with its corresponding constitutive model parameters listed in table 1 in the hca test both the deviator stress σ 1 σ 3 2 and the amplitude of the shear stress were held constant at 65 1 kpa and the direction of the major principal stress ψ was rotated continuously with ψ ranging from 0 to π with a circular stress path as shown in fig 3 the stress path simulated by sm2d also follows a circle with a 65 1 kpa radius which agrees well with the aimed stress path of the hca test consequently the hca test concerning pure psr can be well reproduced by sm2d fig 4 shows the p ψ relationship of the soil element when subject to the undrained shear test concerning the pure psr it can be clearly seen that there is a remarkable decrease in the mean effective stress p under continuous pure rotation in the principal stress direction it is also found that the simulated results show good agreement with the measured data indicating that psr induced deformation can be well captured using the present model 3 2 geotechnical centrifuge tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 carried out geotechnical centrifuge tests to understand the liquefaction characteristics of a sandy seabed under different types of waves including progressive and standing waves to verify the present model an identical case used by sassa and sekiguchi will be reproduced in this section using the developed model both simulated results under progressive and standing waves will be compared with the centrifuge tests the parameters of the wave and soil used in the validation are given in table 2 in the centrifuge test a bed of saturated loose leighton buzzard sand subjected to sinusoidal wave loading with one wave length l and one wave period t is considered sassa and sekiguchi 1999 all these wave tests were performed under a steady state centrifugal acceleration of 50 g the soil bed is 200 mm in width and 100 mm in depth as shown in fig 5 the boundary condition has already been applied in section 2 3 the pore water pressure at the mudline is equal to the wave induced dynamic water pressure which is dependent on the type of wave loading here the submerged unit weight of the soil γ was equal to 425 kn m3 and the wave number κ 2π l was 12 2 m 1 the soil tension is assumed to be positive in both progressive and standing wave cases 3 2 1 progressive wave loading first a linear sinusoidal progressive wave was applied on the seabed as a pressure boundary condition of the following form ye and jeng 2011 19 σ z p e p b x 0 t p 0 cos κ x ω t τ x z 0 at z 0 where p b is the dynamic wave pressure at the seabed surface p 0 γ w h 2cosh κd is the amplitude of the wave pressure at the seabed surface h is the wave height d is the water depth and ω 2π t is the angular frequency of the waves as demonstrated by jeng and zhao 2015 there is no significant discrepancy in the horizontal distribution of accumulated pore pressure in the case of progressive waves as an example the centerline with a centroid at z 15 mm marked as point d in fig 5 is taken as the representative location for verification of the responses of a soil element as listed in table 3 a total of eight cases of progressive wave loading are used to investigate the maximum residual pore pressures p max under different cyclic stress ratios χ 0 p 0 κ γ the associated results marked in red line predicted by the present model are shown in fig 6 in which the centrifugal wave tank test data for loose leighton buzzard sand sassa and sekiguchi 1999 marked with the solid circles are also depicted for comparison as seen the predicted curve of the present model show good consistency with the measured values of p max σ v 0 and χ 0 under progressive wave loading the maximum residual pore pressure p max shows s shaped growth with the increase of the cyclic stress ratio χ 0 when χ 0 is equal to or greater than 0 14 the ratio p max σ v 0 approaches unity which implies that liquefaction occurs as observed in the centrifuge tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 3 2 2 standing wave loading to further validate the feasibility of the integrated model the soil responses under ten cyclic stress ratios in the case of standing wave loading shown in table 4 are presented with comparison to the measured results of sassa and sekiguchi 1999 as shown in fig 7 the numerical setup is identical to the experimental one with the same boundary conditions as the progressive wave case except that the pressure boundary condition at the mudline is expressed as follows 20 σ z p e p b x 0 t p 0 cos κ x cos ω t τ x z 0 at z 0 fig 8 shows the measured values of p max σ v 0 and χ 0 in the centrifugal standing wave tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 in which the predicted curves of the present model are also illustrated for comparison as can be seen the simulated results show good consistency with the centrifuge tests especially near the standing wave nodes similar to the findings for the progressive waves the p max also shows s shaped growth with an increase of the cyclic stress ratio χ 0 as observed in the centrifuge tests liquefaction occurs when χ 0 is equal to or greater than 0 2 and the ratio p max σ v 0 approaches unity unfortunately the predicted soil responses for the antinode are much less than the measured ones which are similar to the predicted results from sassa and sekiguchi 2001 this is likely attributable to the lateral soil movement in the sediment trench during the centrifuge test owing to its limited length which gives rise to pore pressure accumulation at both lateral sides close to the standing wave nodes and subsequently affects the performance of the antinode in the middle test section 4 application after validation the model was extended to a real scale and applied for the standing wave seabed interactions in the computation the incident wave was assumed to be partially reflected forming a series of partial standing waves in front of a breakwater as shown in fig 1 the corresponding dynamic pressure generated at the seafloor which was simplified from a 3d short crested wave tsai 1995 to a 2d standing wave with some algebraic manipulation can be determined in the following form 21 σ z τ x z 0 σ z p e p 0 1 r cos κ x cos ω t 1 r sin κ x sin ω t at z 0 where p 0 p 0 γ w h i 2cosh κd is the amplitude of the wave pressure at the seabed surface h i is the height of the incident wave κ 2π l is the wave number equal to 0 0887 m 1 and l 70 873 m is the length of the incident wave r is the coefficient of wave reflection in this study the following wave parameters in table 5 were used in the numerical examples the seabed was filled with loose leighton buzzard sand and the associated parameters for the present model are presented in table 2 the model parameters for the original pziii model can be also found in table 2 with a b 0 the seabed s saturation thickness and length were listed in table 5 for the computation of the nonlinear standing wave the line of symmetry x 0 m was located underneath the antinode the computational results of two lines x 0 m located at the antinode and x 17 7 m located at the node are taken as representative of the dynamics of loose seabed soil beneath a standing wave the initial conditions were determined from a pre consolidation analysis of the seabed foundation under gravitational forces tension is considered to be positive in this study the stress state in the final consolidation was taken as the initial condition for the following dynamic analysis to further demonstrate the effects of psr on the wave induced soil response the simulated results from the original pziii model are also incorporated into the analysis for comparison 4 1 variation of seabed response under partially reflected standing waves figs 9 and 10 show the time history of pore water pressure and vertical effective stress at the standing wave antinode and node respectively the results indicate that the model is capable of reproducing the elasto plastic behavior of the sandy seabed under cyclic wave loading involving the rotation of principal stress axes the predicted results are consistent with experimental findings in wave flume kirca et al 2013 and geotechnical centrifuge tests sassa and sekiguchi 1999 in which the pore water pressure not surprisingly is more likely to build up and accumulate to a large value at the standing wave node as compared to at the antinode psr induced deformations become increasingly pronounced at the standing wave node owing to the large shear strain induced by the waves which subsequently enhances the plastic strain and build up of the pore pressure in the area on the other hand the original pziii ignores the effects of psr and significantly underestimates the build up of the pore pressure and the reduction of the vertical effective stress in the seabed foundation particularly at the standing wave node at the antinode no rotation in the major principal stress direction is involved and hence no significant difference in the dynamic soil response between the two models can be observed in the region it can also be observed that the cyclic amplitudes of p e are negatively related to the buried depth of the seabed because the transmission of wave loading always shows a progressive attenuation as the buried depth of the seabed increases however the residual pore pressure p e 2 zen and yamazaki 1990 sumer 2014 is more likely to build up in deeper areas z h 0 5 or 0 9 this is due to the fact that the pore water near the seabed surface can drain out from the soil and is therefore less likely to build up in this region in addition at the antinode the discrepancy of the accumulation of p e 2 predicted by the present model and the original pziii is not apparent especially at a shallow buried depth such as location a with z h 0 1 as shown in fig 1 the p e 2 increases with increasing embedment depth whereas at the standing wave nodes regardless of the embedment depth the discrepancy of p e 2 between the two models is significant during the whole computation fig 11 shows snapshots of the dynamic pore pressure at times t 10t and t 45t predicted by the present model and the original pziii it can be observed that the effects of psr on the wave induced soil response are significant giving rise to a larger build up of pore pressure in the present model over the original pziii particularly at the standing wave node in the early loading stage the cumulative plastic strain and subsequent build up of pore pressure in the seabed foundation mainly comes from the wave induced hydro dynamic water pressures acting on the seabed which are most significant at the antinode of the standing wave consequently for both models the seabed foundation which is located at the antinode is the area where the pore water pressure is most likely to build up in the first several loading periods i e t 10t as the wave repetition increases in the present model the effect of psr on the cyclic behavior of the seabed at the standing wave node becomes increasingly important dominating the accumulation of pore water pressure in the area even causing it to exceed the accumulation at the antinode after 45 wave repetitions for the original pziii neglecting the effect of psr the pore pressure at the antinode is always greater than that at the node throughout the whole computation this further confirms the necessity of including psr in numerical simulations of standing wave and seabed interactions otherwise the simulation may lead to contradictory predictions ye et al 2015 yang and ye 2017 a stress path is another way to characterize the liquefaction susceptibility of the seabed under cyclic waves fig 12 shows the effective stress paths at six monitored points marked as points a b and c for line x 0 and a b and c for line x 17 7 m in fig 1 in the seabed foundation under a partially reflected standing wave it is observed that there is a high rate of decrease in p and q at point a and a predicted by the present model until p reaches zero and the soil liquefies the model also predicts a similar trend at other locations however according to the original pziii model the sandy seabed is far from reaching the liquefaction point as p at all the monitored points is greater than zero during the whole computation the effect of psr is well reflected in the marked reduction in the mean effective stress as described above it can also be observed that the results predicted by the present model show a more significant reduction of p at the node compared to at the antinode which is contradictory to the prediction of the original pziii moreover the reduction of p predicted by the original pziii model at the antinode is quicker than that at the node at a deeper buried depth under partially reflected standing waves the predicted deviatoric stress paths in both models show a series of smooth ellipses as shown in fig 13 in addition a remarkable decrease in the deviatoric stress and a progressive liquefaction tendency can be anticipated σ z σ x however the reduction speed predicted by the present model shown as the blue solid line is quicker than the simulated results of the original pziii model shown as the red dashed line especially at the standing wave node for wave induced shear stress however at all soil depths there is no significant discrepancy between the predictions the accumulation of τ xz at the antinode is far less than that at the node which results in a smaller major principal stress angle ψ seen in eq 9 at the antinode therefore the rate of reduction in the deviatoric stress at the node is apparently quicker than that at the antinode as shown in fig 13 cyclic mobility plays an important role in characterizing the soil behavior under wave loading when the present model is adopted the soil behaves similarly to the predictions of the original pziii model at the early stage at the node and during the whole process at the antinode however after specific wave cycles there is a remarkable increase in shear strain at the node predicted by the present model unfortunately the degradation of the shear stiffness at the node cannot be observed in the simulated results of the original pziii model it also can be observed that the development of shear strain predicted by the present model at the node is stronger than that at the antinode because of the effect of psr as introduced earlier the angle of orientation ψ is a key parameter for differentiating the present model and the original pziii in terms of psr induced shear deformations the effects of psr on the standing wave induced soil response can be demonstrated somewhat in the time variations of ψ as shown in fig 14 as seen not surprisingly there is not a large effect of psr at the antinode owing to the small shear strain induced by the waves hence the amplitude of ψ shows little difference between the present model and the original pziii whereas at the wave node the discrepancy is much more obvious especially at deeper locations where the wave induced shear strain is significant the amplitude of ψ predicted by the present model shows a more significant increase when compared with the original pziii which in turn affects the plastic soil deformation and subsequent build up of pore pressure the results further confirm that ignoring the psr induced deformations will significantly underestimate the instability of soil under partially reflected standing waves especially at the node 4 2 progressive liquefaction it has been well recognized that loose sand deposits are likely to become compacted when subject to cyclic shearing i e waves earthquakes or structural vibrations due to the drainage of pore water and the pore pressure tends to accumulate when the drainage condition is impeded during this process the soil skeleton continuously loses its inter granular contact and liquefies when the accumulated pore pressure overcomes the overburdened soil weight here the residual liquefaction potential denoted l p is defined to demonstrate the liquefaction characteristics of a sandy seabed ye et al 2015 22 l p σ z d σ z 0 where σ z d σ z σ z 0 is the wave induced vertical effective stress and σ z and σ z 0 are the current and initial effective stresses respectively okusa 1985 proposed a criterion of liquefaction based on the vertical effective stress σ z 0 and σ z d 23 σ z d σ z 0 according to okusa s liquefaction criterion eq 23 the sandy soil liquefies only when l p is equal to or greater than 1 0 however the value of l p in sandy soil cannot exceed 1 0 in laboratory tests ishihara 1993 wu et al 2004 or numerical simulations ye and jeng 2012 because sandy soil lacks cohesion and unlike silty or clay soil cannot bear any tensile stress wu et al 2004 suggested that sandy soil can be considered liquefied when l p is equal to or greater than 0 78 0 99 in this study the loose leighton buzzard sand is considered to be liquefied when l p is equal to or greater than 0 86 ye et al 2015 fig 15 shows the vertical distribution characteristics of residual pore pressure predicted by the present model and the original pziii model at different times here l r represents the liquefaction resistance line of sandy soil which is equal to 0 86 σ z 0 as seen in the figure p e 2 increases with increasing wave repetitions and approaches the liquefaction resistance line but is incapable of exceeding it liquefaction occurs when p e 2 l r it is found that the liquefaction potential exhibits a significant difference between the present model and the original pziii the current model shows liquefaction is more likely to be observed at the standing wave node owing to the significant wave induced shear strain and the associated psrs rather than at the antinode the original pziii shows the opposite prediction which is contradictory to the experimental findings in the wave flume test kirca et al 2013 and geotechnical wave test sassa and sekiguchi 1999 the main reason is that the original pziii neglects psr induced deformations which significantly underestimate the liquefaction resistance of the sandy seabed at the standing wave node ye et al 2015 yang and ye 2017 leading to unsafe engineering designs 4 3 comparison of standing waves and progressive waves in this section the difference between the dynamic response of the seabed to progressive and standing waves is further investigated by adopting the developed model in the computation the seabed is again considered to be loose leighton buzzard sand sassa and sekiguchi 1999 with the characteristics displayed in table 2 furthermore the boundary condition is the same as that defined in section 2 3 except that a linear progressive wave as shown in eq 19 is applied on the seabed as a pressure boundary condition six representative soil elements as shown in fig 1 on the centerline x 0 and the line x 17 7 m at z h 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 were chosen to study the soil responses under different types of wave loading to ensure a robust comparison a fully reflected standing wave r 1 with identical peak wave components to the progressive wave is used in the calculation the boundary condition is also the same as that illustrated in section 2 3 except that the pressure boundary condition applied on the seabed is a fully reflected standing wave as shown in eq 21 with r 1 the parameters for both the progressive wave and the fully reflected standing wave are listed in table 6 fig 16 shows snapshots of the accumulated pore pressure of the different wave types at the times t 10t and t 22t it was again observed that the standing wave induced pore pressure is strongly dependent on the x direction peaking in the area underneath the standing wave nodes and reaching a minimum at the antinodes as discussed previously whereas no significant difference in the horizontal distribution of the dynamic pore pressure can be observed under progressive waves this is likely attributable to the moveable nature of the progressive wave since the amplitude of each point of a propagating wave is the same as the wave induced shear strain and the rotation of the principal stress axes are uniform in the seabed foundation as shown in fig 17 there is an obvious difference in the soil responses between the two types of waves especially at the antinode such as the accumulation of pore pressure and liquefaction potential first of all as shown in fig 17 because of the static characteristic of the standing wave loading the development of the residual pore pressure p e 2 with depth at the node is quite different from that at the antinode during the first five wave cycles the development of p e 2 at the antinode is stronger than at the node however after 15t a reverse occurs at a shallow depth where the speed of liquefaction becomes much faster at the node than that at the antinode as shown in fig 17 this is due to the fact that p e 2 at the antinode is mainly produced by the vertical cyclic wave pressure without psr occurring at the location as illustrated earlier in fig 14 however results show that there is only shear stress applied at the node and the accumulation of p e 2 there is mainly dependent on the psr as shown in fig 14 the development of the major principal stress angle ψ is positively related to the wave cycles therefore the effect of psr is very limited at the first five wave cycles and the build up of p e 2 at the node is less than that at the antinode after a certain period of time 15t in this case the effect of psr is so strong that the amplitude of p e 2 at the node exceeds that at the antinode at the shallow depth after approximately 17t the sandy seabed at the node begins to liquefy and eventually reaches a liquefied depth of 8 m however the sandy seabed at the antinode does not liquefy until 22t and reaches a corresponding liquefied depth of 3 5 m which is less than half of that at the node moreover at the middle and bottom depths of the seabed the accumulation of p e 2 at the antinode is stronger than that at the node this is due to the fact that the development of ψ is negatively related to the buried depth as shown in fig 14 the effect of psr is inferior to the vertical wave pressure which leads the middle and bottom depths having a lower amplitude of p e 2 at the node than at the antinode there is no obvious difference in the characteristics of progressive liquefaction between the node and the antinode for progressive wave loading in which the symbol presents the location in progressive wave is associated with the node and antinode in fully reflected standing wave rather than the true node and antinode this is due to the moveable characteristic of the progressive wave any location along the seabed undergoes the same loading which has the coupled effects of the vertical wave pressure and shear stress therefore even at the node the liquefied depth and the speed of liquefaction under fully reflected standing wave loading are much less than those under progressive wave loading during the same time period 4 4 parametric studies from the above comparison it can be found that there is a significant distinction between the predicted dynamic responses of sandy soil at the antinodes and at the nodes under partial standing wave loading in this section the sensitivity analysis on the coefficient of wave reflection r wave parameters incident wave height hi wave period t water depth d and seabed characteristics saturability sr permeability coefficient ks0 is addressed in which the baseline values of model parameters of seabed were displayed in table 2 and the reference values of wave and seabed parameters were listed in table 5 the parameter r which can range from 0 to 1 is an important factor to control the reflection efficiency of a progressive wave acting on a marine structure on the one hand if r 0 no reflection occurs and the wave will have the characteristics of a progressive wave on the other hand if r 1 a full reflection occurs and the wave will have the characteristics of a fully reflected standing wave as discussed above the soil response under progressive wave loading is different from that under standing wave loading therefore it is necessary to examine the effect of r on the progressive liquefaction process as illustrated in fig 18 both the speed and depth of liquefaction at the antinode and the node are positive with every value of r in which the region on left and right side of the liquefication depth curve present the no liquefaction and liquefied zone respectively this is because the wave intensity is dependent on the value of parameter r as shown in eq 21 a larger value of the wave intensity leads to an easier liquefaction of the sandy seabed moreover it can also be observed that the liquefaction response at the node is stronger than that at the antinode for most values of r shown in fig 18 the influence of the wave and seabed characteristics on the liquefaction process of a sandy seabed under partially reflected wave loading are shown in fig 19 and fig 20 respectively the most significant wave characteristic is the incident wave height hi shown in fig 19 after 15 time periods of cyclic wave loading the depths of liquefaction at the node and the antinode approach 10 m and 8 m respectively for hi 3 m while no liquefaction occurs at the node or the antinode for hi 1 m in addition both the partial standing wave induced liquefaction depths at the node and the antinode have a positive relationship to the wave height of the incident wave and the wave period but they show a negative relationship to the water depth as shown in fig 20 both the permeability and the saturation of the soil have a significant influence on the liquefaction of the sandy soil it appears that no liquefaction occurs in a very loose seabed when the permeability coefficient ks0 is greater than 1 5 10 2 m s this is because of the fast dissipation of pore pressure in the seabed the maximum liquefaction depth increases with a reduction in ks0 which demonstrates a negative relationship between liquefaction depth and ks0 however the difference is not distinct when ks0 is less than 1 5 10 5 m s therefore the influence of ks0 on the liquefaction depth of sandy soil is limited in a certain range in addition the liquefaction depth is positively related to the saturation of the sandy soil this is because the pure fluid in unsaturated sandy soil always displays significant compressibility because of the presence of gas moreover the liquefaction depth at the node is much greater than that at the antinode for the same wave and seabed characteristics as shown in figs 19 and 20 5 conclusions soil liquefaction in sandy seabed under partially reflected standing waves has become a concern because of its potential weaken effects on the resistance of sediment and the stability of breakwaters seawalls and large caisson structures as an important characteristic of the dynamic response of soil under cyclic wave loading the effect of principal stress rotation psr should be considered in the numerical analysis of wave seabed interaction in this study a modified version of pastor zienkiewicz model mark iii pziii with psr was adopted for investigating the stress strain behavior of sandy soil under wave loading the focus of this study was the effects of psr on the liquefaction potential of interactions between partially reflected standing waves and a seabed based on the numerical examples the following conclusions can be drawn 1 for partially reflected wave loading both the predicted results of the present model and the original pziii model show that the development of the dynamic response under the antinode and the node are negatively related to the buried depth however a large discrepancy between the two models was found for the development of excess pore pressure vertical effective stress the angle of psr and the speed and scale of progressive liquefaction moreover the effects of psr on the liquefaction susceptibility of sandy soils are concentrated in the region under the standing wave node at the antinodes where there is no psr the difference in the predicted soil response between the two models is not significant 2 the predicted results of the original pziii model show that the development of the liquefaction potential around the antinode is always stronger than that around the node this is inconsistent with the experimental results of kirca et al 2013 the simulated results of the present model indicate that the development of the liquefaction potential around the antinodes is stronger than that around the nodes during the initial phase of the experiment however this phenomenon will reverse after a certain period of time owing to the effect of psr therefore it is important to consider the effect of psr in any numerical analysis of the soil response under partially reflected standing wave loading otherwise it will result in discrepancies in the liquefied response such as the liquefied depth and speed of liquefaction between the antinode and the node which is extremely dangerous in practical coastal and offshore engineering 3 the soil response of a loose sandy seabed is dependent on the loading characteristics of the wave for standing wave loading the residual pore pressure p e 2 at the antinode is mainly produced by the vertical cyclic wave pressure with no effect from psr however there is only shear stress existing at the node and the accumulation of p e 2 is mainly dependent on the psr which causes the speed of liquefaction at the node to be much faster than at the antinode for progressive wave loading there is no obvious difference in the characteristics of progressive liquefaction between the node and the antinode because of its moveable nature in addition the liquefaction potential under progressive wave loading is stronger than that under standing wave loading especially at the antinode 4 parametric studies show that the coefficient of wave reflection has a significant influence on the development of progressive liquefaction at the node and the antinode in a sandy seabed additionally the wave induced liquefaction depth has in general a positive relationship with the incident wave height and the wave period but it shows a negative relationship with the water depth the properties of the soil also have a remarkable influence on the liquefaction depth of sandy soil therefore liquefaction is more likely to be observed in a fully saturated seabed when drainage conditions are impeded acknowledgement the national nature fund of china grant nos 51879133 51409142 41502285 51909077 the nature fund

generally about wave diffraction wave resonance may also happen in radiation problems such as two structures in forced oscillations wang and wu 2008 considered a second order problem of two rectangular cylinders in specified vertical and horizontal motions at the natural frequencies ω i i 1 2 in the time domain they found that the first order resonances happened at ω 2 i i 1 2 and the second order happened at ω 2 i 2 i 1 2 in heaving motions or swaying motions in opposite directions for horizontal motions toward the same direction the first order resonance happened at ω 2 i 1 i 1 2 and the second order is at ω 2 i 2 i 1 2 which is similar to that by wu 2007 on a liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank li and zhang 2016 conducted 2d simulation on water wave radiations by two identical and non identical bodies through a boundary element method with linear element and the response amplitude operator has been obtained at the resonant frequencies through changing the draft of each body and the distance between them the works mentioned above do not consider the effect of a current however ships and ocean structures are not only acted by the wave but also by the current the existence of current may significantly change the magnitudes of wave amplitude wave length and frequency and hence can further change loads and the corresponding response of the ship and the platform therefore wave loads on these ocean structures and their corresponding motions may be very different by the wave and current from those by the wave only which may have important influence on the design of these structures an extensive works on wave current body interactions may be found buchmanna skourup and cheung 1998 considered wave runups on a bottom mounted cylinder acted by second order waves and in a steady current this method was then used in studying wave loads on the same cylinder skourup et al 2000 liu teng nin and gou 2010 employed a higher order panel element method to simulate second order interactions between wave current and a semisphere and a vertical cylinder in the time domain an alterative for studying wave current problems is to use the fully nonlinear potential model such as buchmanna et al 2000 celebi 2001 ryu et al 2003 koo and kim 2007 the fully potential model is efficient for lager amplitude waves if viscid effect is not important the shortage of this model is that much computer resource is required shao and faltinsen 2013 used a domain decomposition based method to simulated second order wave problems including both diffraction and radiation by a body in a steady current of small speed it is known from motioned above that quite a few works on wave resonance by two bodies or wave current body interactions by using the potential flow theory including the second order and fully nonlinear models however very little work is done for wave resonance with considering a current fredriksen kristiansen and faltinsen 2014 considered a moonpool in vertical motions at low forward speed and experimental tests and numerical simulations are made to investigate the piston type resonant behavior in their study the effects of the current and the viscosity are considered in this paper we extend the work of wang and wu 2008 to the situation of two bodies in forced excitations in a steady current which is sloshing type resonance and hence it differs from that by fredriksen et al 2014 it is expected that the resonant behaviour may also happen for the two bodies in a current on the other hand the current may have some difference from that without current and may even have important influence on the resonance including waves and hydrodynamic forces the study in this paper is to investigate second order wave resonance and detailed simulations are made through a finite element method with 12 node elements which includes two rectangular cylinders in identically vertical and horizontal motions in a steady current and the effect of current speed on waves and hydrodynamics forces has been analyzed 2 theoretical formulation the full nonlinear problem of two cylinders undergoing forced oscillations in a steady current in the fluid domain is first considered as shown in fig 1 two cartesian coordinate systems are defined in this problem the spaced fixed system oxy in which x axis is on the still water surface and y axis is upwards and perpendicular to the x axis the other is o x k y k which is fixed in cylinder k we denote the cylinder surface as s b k and its unit normal vector is n k n x k n y k which points to the inward of the cylinder and its corresponding mean surface and normal vector are s b k 0 and n k n x k n y k respectively the free surface is denoted as s f and its mean position or still water level is s f 0 the water bottom is along y h we use 0 to represent the fluid domain surrounded by all mean boundary surfaces with the assumption that the fluid is potential flow a velocity potential φ is defined to describe the problem of fluid motion in a steady current with forward speed u 0 along the x axis and it satisfies the laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 in and it may split into two parts 2 φ u 0 x φ where φ is the disturbed potential and it also satisfies 3 2 φ 0 in the free surface conditions for the total potential φ on s f are 4 η t φ x η x φ y 0 on s f and 5 φ t g η 1 2 φ 2 0 on s f where t η and g are the time the wave elevation and the gravity acceleration respectively the condition on the cylinder surface is 6 φ n k φ n k u 0 n x k on s b k on the water bottom the potential satisfies 7 φ n 0 on y h on the truncated surface s c a radiation condition should be imposed see fig 1 through a damping zone method which will be given later the mentioned above boundary conditions or eq 4 7 can also be written with the disturbed potential ϕ as 8 η t u 0 φ x η x φ y 0 on s f 9 φ t g η 1 2 φ 2 u 0 φ x 0 on s f 10 φ n k v n on s b k 11 φ n 0 on y h where v n u 0 n x k n k v k ω k r k is the normal velocity v k is the translational velocity of cylinder k at x c k 0 and ω k is the angular velocity around an axis z k which passes through x c k 0 and is perpendicular to the xoy plane r k x x c k y is the location vector the initial conditions on free surface is 12 η x y t 0 0 φ x y t 0 u 0 x or 13 η x y t 0 0 φ x y t 0 0 based on the perturbation method the cylinder motion is small when compared with its principal dimension we can expand the free surface and body surface conditions to their mean positions s f 0 and s b k 0 respectively the resultant movement of a point x k y k on the cylinder surface is written as 14 x k x k y k δ x k x k cos θ k y k sin θ k δ y k x k sin θ k y k cos θ k x k y k where δ k δ x k δ y k is the translational displacement and θ k is the rotation angle about z k using the taylor series expansion the free surface conditions 8 9 then become 15 η t u 0 φ x η x φ y η y η t u 0 φ x η x φ y 0 on y 0 16 φ t g η 1 2 φ 2 u 0 φ x η y φ t g η 1 2 φ 2 u 0 φ x 0 on y 0 and the normal velocity on the cylinder surface is 17 x k n k φ n k φ x k φ n k on s b k 0 where s f 0 is the mean water level and the over dot of x k means the time derivative based on the stokes expansion we write the potential φ as 18 φ φ 0 ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 where ε is a small parameter and chosen to be the first order wave slope φ 0 is the disturbed potential due to the current and φ i i 1 2 is the i th order potential similarly we write the wave elevation η displacement δ k and rotation angle θ k as 19 f ε f 1 ε 2 f 2 where f represents η δ k or θ k the disturbed wave due to current only is omitted eq 14 can be written as 20 x k x k y k δ x k x k θ k 2 2 y k θ k δ y k x k θ k y k θ k 2 2 o ε 3 in above equation we have dropped superscript 1 of δ x k δ y k and θ k for convenience of writing since we consider first order motion only the terms related to θ 2 in eq 20 are dropped thus eq 20 becomes 21 x k x k y k δ x k y k θ k δ y k x k θ k similarly the unit normal vector n is 22 n k n x k n x k n x k n y k θ k n y k n x k θ k substituting eqs 18 19 into 3 8 11 and eqs 21 22 into 17 and comparing the identical order of ε between the left and right hand sides of every equations the governing equations for φ l l 0 1 2 become 23 2 φ l 0 in 0 and the corresponding l th order boundary conditions become 24 φ l y 0 on y 0 25 φ l n u 0 n x k on s b k 0 26 φ l y 0 on y h for l 0 and 27 η l t φ l y f 1 l on y 0 28 φ l t g η l f 2 l on y 0 29 φ l n g l on s b k 0 30 φ l y 0 on y h for l 1 2 the terms f l f l and g l in these equations can be written as f 1 1 u 0 φ 0 x η

through a higher order finite element method with 12 node quadrilateral elements and it will addressed in detail in section 3 the pressure on the cylinder surface is given as follow by using the bernoulli equation 31 p ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 u 0 φ x u 0 2 2 g y using the perturbation method and stokes expansion y in eq 31 is given as follow 32 y k y k y k x k θ k y k θ k 2 2 the force f k and moment m k on s b k are 33 f k s b k p n k d s 34 m k s b k p r k n k d s substitute eqs 18 and 32 into 31 and then eqs 31 and 22 into 33 we obtain 35 f f k 0 f k 1 f k 2 where f k 0 is the force due to the current f k 1 and f k 2 are the first and second order forces respectively and their expressions are 36 f k 0 ρ s b k 0 1 2 φ 0 2 u 0 φ 0 x u 0 2 2 n k d s 37 f k 1 ρ s b k 0 φ 1 t u 0 φ 1 x φ 0 φ 1 n

the x coordinate of the centre of flotation when the cylinder is at rest η l and η r are wave elevations at left and right points of intersection between the mean water surface and the cylinder surface respectively the calculation of moments m k 0 m k 1 and m k 2 is similar to eq 36 38 respectively 3 finite element solution and numerical techniques a finite element method is employed to solve eq 23 30 for obtaining φ k k 0 1 2 a mesh is necessary for the finite element analysis and a type of quadrilateral 12 node element see fig 2 is used in the present numerical simulation a local coordinate system ρ ξ η is defined in a square element with side length equal to 2 and it can be mapped to the global coordinate system r x y with 12 node element the mapping can be expressed as 39 r i 1 12 r i e n i ξ η where r i e is the global coordinate vector of any node of element e and n i ξ η i 1 2 12 are shape or interpolation functions and may be expressed as 40 n i ξ η 1 32 1 ξ ξ i 1 η η i 10 9 ξ 2 η 2 i 1 2 3 4 n i ξ η 9 32 1 η η i 1 9 ξ ξ i 1 ξ 2 i 5 6 9 10 n i ξ η 9 32 1 ξ ξ i 1 9 η η i 1 η 2 i 7 8 11 12 similarly the velocity potential φ k k 0 1 2 are 41 φ k x y i 1 12 φ i k n i ξ η where φ i k is the potential at nodes i of element e respectively a mesh with 12 node elements for two rectangular cylinders is shown in fig 3 based on the mesh generation and element mapping by interpolation functions the following finite element equation can be obtained by the galerkin method 42 m φ k f k k 0 1 2 where m i j 0 n i n j d f i k s b k 0 n j φ k n d s i j in above equations are the global serial numbers of i j respectively the global coefficient matrix m is a sparse symmetric and positive definite and non zero elements are stored only an iteration method based on the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm is used to solve eq 42 to obtain the potentials φ k k 0 1 2 eqs 27 29 contain some derivatives of φ 0 φ 1 with respect to x y such as φ 1 x φ 1 y 2 φ 0 y 2 2 φ 1 x 2 2 φ 1 x y and 2 φ 1 y 2 we calculate them through differencing the shape functions which is very similar to that a 8 node quadrilateral element used by wang and wu 2008 the difference is that 12 node element with cubic shape functions is used in the present simulation which may be better than using the 8 node elements since their second order derivatives are continuous between different elements the derivatives mentioned above can be easily obtained by using eq 39 41 43 φ x j 1 12 φ j n j x φ y j 1 12 φ j n j y 44 2 φ x 2 j 1 12 φ j 2 n j x 2 2 φ x y j 1 12 φ j 2 n j x y 2 φ y 2 j 1 12 φ j 2 n j y 2 an important factor for long time simulations is to impose a proper radiation condition on the truncated boundary s c to avoid the arising of reflected waves as far as possible we use a damping zone method with an artificial viscous coefficient added to eqs 27 and 28 cointe et al 1990 45 η l t φ l y f 1 l ν η l 46 φ l t g η l f 2 l ν φ l with ν x α ω x x 0 λ 2 x 0 x x 1 x 0 β λ 0 0 x x 0 or x x 1 where ω is the linear wave frequency λ the linear wave length the damping zone starts from a point at x 0 and extends to x 0 β λ parameters α and β control the strength and the length of the damping zone respectively according to tanizawa 1996 we chose α 1 in the simulations β is chosen as 1 for longer wave and 2 for shorter wave respectively the information on mean free surface at a new time step should be updated since the simulation is in the time domain we use the fourth order adams bashforth equation to calculate wave elevation η l l 1 2 and potential φ l l 1 2 at the next time step based on eq 45 46 with considering the artificial viscous coefficient 4 results and discussions in the simulation a ramp function r t isaacson ng 1993 is applied in eq 29 for letting the wave development to be gradual and smooth which is useful for the stability of the numerical simulation eq 29 becomes 47 φ l n r t g l l 1 2 where r t 1 cos π t 2 t 2 t 2 t 1 t 2 t and t 2 π ω is the linear wave period we consider two identical rectangular cylinders in forced motions the breadth of each cylinder is 2b and its draught in undisturbed water is d in the simulations d is chosen to be b the centre lines of the two cylinders are located x c 1 l and x c 2 l respectively the nondimensional water depth is h d 10 both cylinders are subjected to the following sinusoidal oscillation in horizontal or vertical direction 48 δ a sin ω t where a is the oscillational amplitude and ω is the oscillational frequency in all simulations the default value of nondimensional amplitude a d 0 0125 if it is not assigned when there is no current the real resonant frequency is ω i c ω i i 1 2 wang and wu 2008 where c is a constant and can be obtained by numerical tests ω n is the resonant or natural frequency of a sloshing tank with 2 l b in width and great depth of water and it is expressed as 49 ω i i π 2 l b g i 1 2 wang and wu 2008 simulated vertical oscillations of two identical cylinders at resonant frequencies without a current the resonant motion occurs at the even natural frequencies ω 2 i i 1 2 or ω 2 i 2 i 1 2 in eq 49 in vertical motions we now consider some cases related to ω 2 as discussed in wang and wu 2008 the real resonant frequency is ω 2 1 01 ω 2 in the simulation the distance between the truncated surface s c and the origin point are four time linear wavelength there are 14 segments on s c and 50 segments on the still water surface outside both cylinders and 24 segments between them 6 segments are used on each cylinder wall and 12 segments on its bottom thus a mesh of 10163 nodes and 1928 elements are generated it should be noted that more nodes are required near the water surface and cylinder surface which can be carried out through an exponential function chung 2002 the time step is chosen to be dt t 200 we denote the left and right sides of cylinder one left cylinder as p l1 p r1 and those of cylinder two right cylinder as p l2 p r2 respectively fig 4 shows histories of waves at p r1 at ω 2 1 01 ω 2 together with those at 0 5 ω 2 0 9 ω 2 and 1 1 ω 2 results are provided only for cylinder one due to symmetry it is shown that the first order or linear runup always increases with the time and becomes very large at ω ω 2 and the second order wave runup also shows a similar variation with time at ω 0 5 ω 2 however both first and second order runups are quite small at ω 0 9 ω 2 and 1 1 ω 2 it is known from mentioned above that the runups between the two cylinders are abnormally large at the resonant frequency ω ω 2 or even at ω 0 5 ω 2 in the cases of no current we now consider some cases at ω ω 2 and froude number f n 0 064 0 128 to see how the current affects the wave the froude number f n is defined as f n u 0 g b comparisons are made for f n 0 0 064 and 0 128 and the results of waves at p r1 and p l2 are given in fig 5 it is seen from the figure that the runups at 0 064 is just a little smaller than that at f n 0 but it finally declines while the runup at f n 0 keeps increasing the runups at f n 0 128 however increase when t t 22 and then gradually decreases the maximum value of wave peaks within 50 cycles reaches to 20 2 at f n 0 17 2 at f n 0 064 and 9 0 at f n 0 128 for the wave at p r1 and 20 2 at f n 0 17 0 at f n 0 064 and 9 0 at f n 0 128 for the wave at p l2 respectively this is because the wave frequency without current or at f n 0 is identical to the oscilaltional or resonant frequency ω ω 2 however it is different from ω 2 at f n 0 064 and 0 128 a larger froude number lead to its wave frequency with current to be more deviated from that without current or the natural frequency and hence the runup at f n 0 128 become much smaller than that at f n 0 with the development of time numerical tests are now made to determine the oscillational frequencies ω 2 of both cylinders in a current when the resonance happens the result is given in fig 6 for f n 0 064 it is shown that ω 2 1 005 ω 2 is a better approximation since its wave runup is the largest similarly it is found that ω 2 0 99 ω 2 is the best for f n 0 128 which means that the oscillational frequency declines as the increase of the froude number a comparison of linear wave runups at f n 0 0 064 and 0 128 is given in fig 7 at their own oscillational frequencies ω 2 1 01 ω 2 1 005 ω 2 and 0 99 ω 2 respectively and it is found that the runups at f n 0 are the largest at both locations of p r1 p l2 and those at f n 0 128 are the smallest which indicates that the wave runup at each intersection point between cylinders decreases at resonance when froude number increases in these cases the linear wave and its superposition with the second order at f n 0 064 and 0 128 are given in fig 8 similar to the situation without current or f n 0 the second order wave is much smaller than the linear since it is the first order resonance fig 9 gives the corresponding forces acting on cylinder one at f n 0 0 064 and 0 128 similar to the linear wave the peaks or troughs of horizontal and vertical force components decrease as f n increases for both the linear and its superposition with the second order we can also see that the horizontal force has no visible difference between the linear and the superposition at each froude number the vertical forces are however clearly different between them this is because the horizontal force has bigger first order component and smaller second order component see fig 10 a and b at each f n relatively the first order component of vertical force is smaller and the second order is bigger see fig 10c and d it can also be seen from fig 9b d 9f that the superposition or linear plus second order obviously deviates from the linear and the difference is even clearer at smaller f n and hence has stronger nonlinearity and this indicates the nonlinearity of vertical force becomes weaker as the increase of froude number when resonance happens a comparison of linear hydrodynamic forces on cylinders one and two are depicted in fig 11 the forces on both cylinders has identical phase in the vertical direction and opposite phase in the horizontal when f n 0 see fig 11a and b due to symmetry the amplitude of horizontal force on cylinder one is a little smaller than that on cylinder two at f n 0 064 and 0 128 because the former becomes smaller and the latter becomes larger as f n increases in contrast to this the vertical force shows an opposite variation in addition the phases of forces in both horizontal and vertical direction clearly change with the f n due to the current effect similarity can be found for the second order forces on both cylinders in fig 12 the difference is the horizontal second order forces are always negative for cylinder one and positive for cylinder two fig 13 shows free surface profiles at f n 0 128 a d 0 05 from t 45t 45 5t with a time interval δ t 0 1 t t is the first order wave period without current in the figure λis the first order wave length without current similar to the situation at f n 0 the resonant waves for both linear and superposition of linear and second order between both cylinders are much larger than those outside the difference is that they are nonsymmetrical about x 0 at f n 0 128 due to the existence of current while they are symmetrical about x 0 at f n 0 in vertical motions the second order effect of the waves between cylinders is also seen to be evident through comparing fig 13b with 13a furthermore the doppler effect can be observed the wave length in the left region of cylinder one is shorter than that in the right region of cylinder two because the former is adverse to the current and the latter is coplanar to the current direction the work mentioned above is about the situation at the first order resonance we now consider second order resonance at oscillational frequencies ω 2 2 fig 14 shows the first and second order wave runups at p r1 p l2 with f n 0 0 064 and 0 128 in which k is the wave number which is obtained through solving equation ω k g tanh k h we can see from fig 14a and c that the amplitudes of linear wave at both locations almost remain constant and their corresponding phases are identical to each other at three froude numbers the second order waves shown in fig 14b and d however exhibit clear resonant characteristic at each froude number and the wave runup decreases as the froude number increases which is similar to those at the first order resonance shown in fig 7 further results for the total waves at p r1 are given in fig 15 the nonlinearity is quite strong at each froude number f n and it becomes weaker as f n increases since the second order wave runup becomes smaller as f n increases see fig 14b and d while the first order almost keeps unchanged see fig 14a and c fig 16 gives the corresponding hydrodynamic forces on cylinder one similar to the linear waves in fig 14a and c the amplitudes of linear components in both horizontal and vertical directions remain almost constant at each f n and there is a little discrepancy between different f n the second order force however keeps increasing with the development of time at each f n and decreases as f n increases fig 16b andd and fig 17 gives the corresponding linear and linear plus second order hydrodynamic forces on cylinder one compared with those at the first order resonance infig 9 their similarity and difference can be clearly seen comparisons of hydrodynamic forces on cylinders one and two are also made see fig 18 we give the results about the second order force only since the linear force almost remains constant at each f n when f n increases the amplitudes of force components in x and y direction decreases for each cylinder and they are smaller for cylinder two than those for cylinder one fig 19 shows wave profiles of the linear and its superposition with the second order from t 46t 50t with a time interval δt 0 1t at ω 2 2 the wave development with time can be clearly seen between both cylinders and outside of them it is observed that the linear and the superposed waves between both cylinders differ from each other at each froude number and they change as the increase of f n it can also be observed that the nonlinear effect of waves between both cylinders is very clear through comparing the linear and the superposed waves at each f n just like the first order resonance at ω 2 see fig 13 the linear and the superposed waves outside both cylinders also have clear doppler effect at larger f n smaller wave length larger wave amplitude within the left region of cylinder one and bigger wave length smaller wave amplitude within the right region of cylinder two further simulations have been made at oscillational frequencies ω ω 4 and ω ω 4 2 and the results are given in fig 20 numerical tests are made and it is found that ω 4 0 99 ω 4 0 96 ω 4 are good approximation for ω 4 at f n 0 0 064 and 0 128 respectively fig 20 gives the linear and second order waves at ω 4 and ω 4 2 the effect of current on them is very clear we know from above discussion that the wave and force generally become smaller as f n increases in the case at ω 4 2 the second order wave peaks and troughs are however are generally increase as f n increase which is obviously different from the situation at ω ω 2 2 see fig 14b d we also undertake some simulations at f n 0 064 and 0 128 which means a current toward the negative x direction numerical tests show their resonant frequencies are equal to their absolute values of froude number or f n 0 064 and 0 128 respectively the results are completely identical to those at f n 0 064 and 0 128 if we exchange cylinders one and two further simulations are made for both cylinders in horizontal motions or anti symmetrical swaying motions defined in eq 48 the first and second order resonances happens at ω ω 2 i 1 i 1 2 and ω ω 2 i 2 i 1 2 respectively wu 2007 as discussed in wang and wu 2008 the resonant or oscillational frequencies ω 1 1 068 ω 1 ω 2 1 01 ω 2 ω 3 ω 3 and ω 4 ω 4 when not considering current effect similar to aforementioned analysis in the vertical motions the oscillational frequencies ω i i 1 2 3 4 are a little different when the current is considered and they are summarized in table 1 at f n 0 0 064 0 128 through numerical tests fig 21 23 give results at ω ω 1 in the simulations we also consider some cases at f n 0 064 0 128 besides 0 0 064 0 128 similar to the vertical motions the linear waves at f n 0 are the largest and they generally decrease as the absolute value of f n increases for both cylinders shown in fig 21 fig 22 gives the corresponding linear forces on cylinders the variation of horizontal forces with f n resembles the situation of the first order wave however the amplitude of vertical force becomes larger as f n increases and it is largest at f n 0 128 fig 22b for cylinder one however its change with f n is opposite for cylinder two fig 22d the corresponding linear force and resultant force of linear and second order on cylinder one is given in fig 23 in which the results at f n 0 128 0 0 128 are given only the second order contribution to the total forces especially for the vertical component can be clearly seen the nonlinearity of force at f n 0 128 0 128 is stronger than that at f n 0 for horizontal component and is weaker for the vertical fig 24 gives the linear hydrodynamic forces on both cylinders at ω 3 it is seen that the difference between five froude numbers is very evident and the forces at f n 0 are the largest for both horizontal and vertical components fig 25 shows the second order waves at ω ω 2 2 and the corresponding second order forces on both cylinders are depicted in fig 26 it is also interesting to see that the amplitudes of second order waves at p r1 p l2 become larger with the increase of f n which is completely different from the situation in vertical motions shown in fig 14b and d however the second order forces on both cylinders generally become larger as the increase of the absolute value of f n also the force amplitudes on cylinder one at f n 0 064 0 128 are larger than those at f n 0 064 0 128 respectively while the situation is just opposite for cylinder two simulations are also made at ω ω 4 2 and the results are given in fig 27 the current effect on the second order force is also evident in this case the current causes dramatic drop in amplitude with the increase of the absolute value f n for the horizontal forces their maximum values are 3 39 21 0 33 1 18 7 2 44 for cylinder one and 3 47 21 5 36 2 24 0 4 2 for cylinder two at f n 0 128 0 064 0 0 064 0 128 respectively the work mentioned above is on the distance between two cylinders l 8b we also simulate some cases at different l some results are given in fig 28 30 for ω ω 2 in vertical motions and ω ω 1 in horizontal motions in the same direction fig 28 is the oscillational frequencies ω 2 ω 2 in vertical motions and ω 1 ω 1 in horizontal motions as functions of l b the oscillational frequency is generally linearly increases as l b increases for the horizontal motions within the whole range of l b and for the vertical motions when l b 6 and it is becomes smaller as f n increases at each l b fig 29 gives first order waves at p r1 at ω ω 2 and f n 0 0 064 0 128 with different l b and results in vertical motions are given only we can see that the wave amplitude at around l b 9 is the largest at each f n fig 30 gives corresponding first order forces on cylinder one and the horizontal component show similar variation to the wave given in fig 29 5 conclusions a second order theory has been employed to investigate wave resonance between two cylinders in specified motions in a steady current in time domain a higher order finite element method with 12 node element is employed in the simulation the i th i 0 1 2 order potentials are obtained through solving the finite element system based on the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm the shape functions are used to calculate each order derivatives with respect to the space in boundary conditions directly a damping zone method is used for satisfying the radiation condition numerical simulations have been made for two rectangular cylinders in free surface in vertical and horizontal motions in a steady current the wave and the hydrodynamic force have been computed at ω i i 1 2 3 4 and ω 2 i 2 i 1 2 at different current speeds and comparisons are made the current effect on wave and force has been analyzed and the nonlinearity of waves and forces for each cylinder has also been discussed the simulation shows the current has important influence on the waves and forces for the cylinders at resonant frequencies in both vertical and horizontal oscillations the amplitudes of wave and force at first order resonant frequencies are found to generally decrease as the froude number increases but not necessary for second order resonance such as the vertical motions at ω 4 2 and the horizontal motions at ω 2 2 their nonlinearities are also clearly affected by the current and they generally become weaker as froude number increases when resonance happens the effect of spacing between both cylinders on the waves and hydrodynamic forces at different froude numbers are also investigated at resonant frequencies and it is shown that the oscillational frequencies of cylinders generally increase as the increase of spacing when resonance happens all these have direct implications for the design ship and ocean structures with two or more bodies such as catamaran and other similar structures in a current acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural

22184,wave resonance by forced motions of two bodies in a steady current is investigated in this paper the work is based on second order theory of potential flow and the simulation is through a higher order finite element method with 12 node elements in time domain boundary conditions are imposed on mean positions of all boundaries the i th i 1 2 order potentials in the fluid domain at each time step are obtained by solving the finite element system and the spatial derivatives of the potential are calculated by differencing the shape functions directly numerical cases are given for two rectangular cylinders undergoing in specified oscillations in a steady current the first and second order resonances have been captured at their resonant frequencies at different current speeds which does not seem to have been studied yet the numerical result shows that the current speed has important influence on the wave and force at both first and second order resonances keywords resonance radiation current second order theory higher order finite element method 1 introduction wave resonance is a very interesting problem in ship and ocean structure such as sloshing in a tank and multiple bodies in waves at resonant frequencies e g wu et al 1998 wu 2007 zhang et al 2014 maniar and newman 1997 malenica et al 1999 wang and wu 2007 kagemoto et al 2014 bai et al 2014 within recent years wave resonance by two close bodies in waves received extensive attention due to practical operation in offshore engineering and quite a lot works may be found sun eatock taylor taylor 2010 2015 investigated three dimensional 3d frequency domain second order wave diffraction by two adjacent barges or tanker and an flng barge and resonant waves between them were analyzed ning et al 2015 and feng and bai 2015 consider similar fully nonlinear problems for 2d two dimensional and 3d wave resonance by multiple bodies in narrow gap watai et al 2015 made numerical and experimental studies for two side by side ships in waves shivaji ganesan and sen 2016 studied 3d gap resonance by side by side floating bodies using a panel method a similar study on wave resonance by side by side structures was made by zhao et al 2018 besides some works on wave resonance by two bodies based on the viscous flow theory can be found eg lu et al 2011 chua et al 2017 jiang et al 2018 all aforementioned are generally about wave diffraction wave resonance may also happen in radiation problems such as two structures in forced oscillations wang and wu 2008 considered a second order problem of two rectangular cylinders in specified vertical and horizontal motions at the natural frequencies ω i i 1 2 in the time domain they found that the first order resonances happened at ω 2 i i 1 2 and the second order happened at ω 2 i 2 i 1 2 in heaving motions or swaying motions in opposite directions for horizontal motions toward the same direction the first order resonance happened at ω 2 i 1 i 1 2 and the second order is at ω 2 i 2 i 1 2 which is similar to that by wu 2007 on a liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank li and zhang 2016 conducted 2d simulation on water wave radiations by two identical and non identical bodies through a boundary element method with linear element and the response amplitude operator has been obtained at the resonant frequencies through changing the draft of each body and the distance between them the works mentioned above do not consider the effect of a current however ships and ocean structures are not only acted by the wave but also by the current the existence of current may significantly change the magnitudes of wave amplitude wave length and frequency and hence can further change loads and the corresponding response of the ship and the platform therefore wave loads on these ocean structures and their corresponding motions may be very different by the wave and current from those by the wave only which may have important influence on the design of these structures an extensive works on wave current body interactions may be found buchmanna skourup and cheung 1998 considered wave runups on a bottom mounted cylinder acted by second order waves and in a steady current this method was then used in studying wave loads on the same cylinder skourup et al 2000 liu teng nin and gou 2010 employed a higher order panel element method to simulate second order interactions between wave current and a semisphere and a vertical cylinder in the time domain an alterative for studying wave current problems is to use the fully nonlinear potential model such as buchmanna et al 2000 celebi 2001 ryu et al 2003 koo and kim 2007 the fully potential model is efficient for lager amplitude waves if viscid effect is not important the shortage of this model is that much computer resource is required shao and faltinsen 2013 used a domain decomposition based method to simulated second order wave problems including both diffraction and radiation by a body in a steady current of small speed it is known from motioned above that quite a few works on wave resonance by two bodies or wave current body interactions by using the potential flow theory including the second order and fully nonlinear models however very little work is done for wave resonance with considering a current fredriksen kristiansen and faltinsen 2014 considered a moonpool in vertical motions at low forward speed and experimental tests and numerical simulations are made to investigate the piston type resonant behavior in their study the effects of the current and the viscosity are considered in this paper we extend the work of wang and wu 2008 to the situation of two bodies in forced excitations in a steady current which is sloshing type resonance and hence it differs from that by fredriksen et al 2014 it is expected that the resonant behaviour may also happen for the two bodies in a current on the other hand the current may have some difference from that without current and may even have important influence on the resonance including waves and hydrodynamic forces the study in this paper is to investigate second order wave resonance and detailed simulations are made through a finite element method with 12 node elements which includes two rectangular cylinders in identically vertical and horizontal motions in a steady current and the effect of current speed on waves and hydrodynamics forces has been analyzed 2 theoretical formulation the full nonlinear problem of two cylinders undergoing forced oscillations in a steady current in the fluid domain is first considered as shown in fig 1 two cartesian coordinate systems are defined in this problem the spaced fixed system oxy in which x axis is on the still water surface and y axis is upwards and perpendicular to the x axis the other is o x k y k which is fixed in cylinder k we denote the cylinder surface as s b k and its unit normal vector is n k n x k n y k which points to the inward of the cylinder and its corresponding mean surface and normal vector are s b k 0 and n k n x k n y k respectively the free surface is denoted as s f and its mean position or still water level is s f 0 the water bottom is along y h we use 0 to represent the fluid domain surrounded by all mean boundary surfaces with the assumption that the fluid is potential flow a velocity potential φ is defined to describe the problem of fluid motion in a steady current with forward speed u 0 along the x axis and it satisfies the laplace equation 1 2 φ 0 in and it may split into two parts 2 φ u 0 x φ where φ is the disturbed potential and it also satisfies 3 2 φ 0 in the free surface conditions for the total potential φ on s f are 4 η t φ x η x φ y 0 on s f and 5 φ t g η 1 2 φ 2 0 on s f where t η and g are the time the wave elevation and the gravity acceleration respectively the condition on the cylinder surface is 6 φ n k φ n k u 0 n x k on s b k on the water bottom the potential satisfies 7 φ n 0 on y h on the truncated surface s c a radiation condition should be imposed see fig 1 through a damping zone method which will be given later the mentioned above boundary conditions or eq 4 7 can also be written with the disturbed potential ϕ as 8 η t u 0 φ x η x φ y 0 on s f 9 φ t g η 1 2 φ 2 u 0 φ x 0 on s f 10 φ n k v n on s b k 11 φ n 0 on y h where v n u 0 n x k n k v k ω k r k is the normal velocity v k is the translational velocity of cylinder k at x c k 0 and ω k is the angular velocity around an axis z k which passes through x c k 0 and is perpendicular to the xoy plane r k x x c k y is the location vector the initial conditions on free surface is 12 η x y t 0 0 φ x y t 0 u 0 x or 13 η x y t 0 0 φ x y t 0 0 based on the perturbation method the cylinder motion is small when compared with its principal dimension we can expand the free surface and body surface conditions to their mean positions s f 0 and s b k 0 respectively the resultant movement of a point x k y k on the cylinder surface is written as 14 x k x k y k δ x k x k cos θ k y k sin θ k δ y k x k sin θ k y k cos θ k x k y k where δ k δ x k δ y k is the translational displacement and θ k is the rotation angle about z k using the taylor series expansion the free surface conditions 8 9 then become 15 η t u 0 φ x η x φ y η y η t u 0 φ x η x φ y 0 on y 0 16 φ t g η 1 2 φ 2 u 0 φ x η y φ t g η 1 2 φ 2 u 0 φ x 0 on y 0 and the normal velocity on the cylinder surface is 17 x k n k φ n k φ x k φ n k on s b k 0 where s f 0 is the mean water level and the over dot of x k means the time derivative based on the stokes expansion we write the potential φ as 18 φ φ 0 ε φ 1 ε 2 φ 2 where ε is a small parameter and chosen to be the first order wave slope φ 0 is the disturbed potential due to the current and φ i i 1 2 is the i th order potential similarly we write the wave elevation η displacement δ k and rotation angle θ k as 19 f ε f 1 ε 2 f 2 where f represents η δ k or θ k the disturbed wave due to current only is omitted eq 14 can be written as 20 x k x k y k δ x k x k θ k 2 2 y k θ k δ y k x k θ k y k θ k 2 2 o ε 3 in above equation we have dropped superscript 1 of δ x k δ y k and θ k for convenience of writing since we consider first order motion only the terms related to θ 2 in eq 20 are dropped thus eq 20 becomes 21 x k x k y k δ x k y k θ k δ y k x k θ k similarly the unit normal vector n is 22 n k n x k n x k n x k n y k θ k n y k n x k θ k substituting eqs 18 19 into 3 8 11 and eqs 21 22 into 17 and comparing the identical order of ε between the left and right hand sides of every equations the governing equations for φ l l 0 1 2 become 23 2 φ l 0 in 0 and the corresponding l th order boundary conditions become 24 φ l y 0 on y 0 25 φ l n u 0 n x k on s b k 0 26 φ l y 0 on y h

through a higher order finite element method with 12 node quadrilateral elements and it will addressed in detail in section 3 the pressure on the cylinder surface is given as follow by using the bernoulli equation 31 p ρ φ t 1 2 φ 2 u 0 φ x u 0 2 2 g y using the perturbation method and stokes expansion y in eq 31 is given as follow 32 y k y k y k x k θ k y k θ k 2 2 the force f k and moment m k on s b k are 33 f k s b k p n k d s 34 m k s b k p r k n k d s substitute eqs 18 and 32 into 31 and then eqs 31 and 22 into 33 we obtain 35 f f k 0 f k 1 f k 2 where f k 0 is the force due to the current f k 1 and f k 2 are the first and second order forces respectively and their expressions are 36 f k 0 ρ s b k 0 1 2 φ 0 2 u 0 φ 0 x u 0 2 2 n k d s 37 f k 1 ρ s b k 0 φ 1 t u 0 φ 1 x φ 0 φ 1 n

the x coordinate of the centre of flotation when the cylinder is at rest η l and η r are wave elevations at left and right points of intersection between the mean water surface and the cylinder surface respectively the calculation of moments m k 0 m k 1 and m k 2 is similar to eq 36 38 respectively 3 finite element solution and numerical techniques a finite element method is employed to solve eq 23 30 for obtaining φ k k 0 1 2 a mesh is necessary for the finite element analysis and a type of quadrilateral 12 node element see fig 2 is used in the present numerical simulation a local coordinate system ρ ξ η is defined in a square element with side length equal to 2 and it can be mapped to the global coordinate system r x y with 12 node element the mapping can be expressed as 39 r i 1 12 r i e n i ξ η where r i e is the global coordinate vector of any node of element e and n i ξ η i 1 2 12 are shape or interpolation functions and may be expressed as 40 n i ξ η 1 32 1 ξ ξ i 1 η η i 10 9 ξ 2 η 2 i 1 2 3 4 n i ξ η 9 32 1 η η i 1 9 ξ ξ i 1 ξ 2 i 5 6 9 10 n i ξ η 9 32 1 ξ ξ i 1 9 η η i 1 η 2 i 7 8 11 12 similarly the velocity potential φ k k 0 1 2 are 41 φ k x y i 1 12 φ i k n i ξ η where φ i k is the potential at nodes i of element e respectively a mesh with 12 node elements for two rectangular cylinders is shown in fig 3 based on the mesh generation and element mapping by interpolation functions the following finite element equation can be obtained by the galerkin method 42 m φ k f k k 0 1 2 where m i j 0 n i n j d f i k s b k 0 n j φ k n d s i j in above equations are the global serial numbers of i j respectively the global coefficient matrix m is a sparse symmetric and positive definite and non zero elements are stored only an iteration method based on the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm is used to solve eq 42 to obtain the potentials φ k k 0 1 2 eqs 27 29 contain some derivatives of φ 0 φ 1 with respect to x y such as φ 1 x φ 1 y 2 φ 0 y 2 2 φ 1 x 2 2 φ 1 x y and 2 φ 1 y 2 we calculate them through differencing the shape functions which is very similar to that a 8 node quadrilateral element used by wang and wu 2008 the difference is that 12 node element with cubic shape functions is used in the present simulation which may be better than using the 8 node elements since their second order derivatives are continuous between different elements the derivatives mentioned above can be easily obtained by using eq 39 41 43 φ x j 1 12 φ j n j x φ y j 1 12 φ j n j y 44 2 φ x 2 j 1 12 φ j 2 n j x 2 2 φ x y j 1 12 φ j 2 n j x y 2 φ y 2 j 1 12 φ j 2 n j y 2 an important factor for long time simulations is to impose a proper radiation condition on the truncated boundary s c to avoid the arising of reflected waves as far as possible we use a damping zone method with an artificial viscous coefficient added to eqs 27 and 28 cointe et al 1990 45 η l t φ l y f 1 l ν η l 46 φ l t g η l f 2 l ν φ l with ν x α ω x x 0 λ 2 x 0 x x 1 x 0 β λ 0 0 x x 0 or x x 1 where ω is the linear wave frequency λ the linear wave length the damping zone starts from a point at x 0 and extends to x 0 β λ parameters α and β control the strength and the length of the damping zone respectively according to tanizawa 1996 we chose α 1 in the simulations β is chosen as 1 for longer wave and 2 for shorter wave respectively the information on mean free surface at a new time step should be updated since the simulation is in the time domain we use the fourth order adams bashforth equation to calculate wave elevation η l l 1 2 and potential φ l l 1 2 at the next time step based on eq 45 46 with considering the artificial viscous coefficient 4 results and discussions in the simulation a ramp function r t isaacson ng 1993 is applied in eq 29 for letting the wave development to be gradual and smooth which is useful for the stability of the numerical simulation eq 29 becomes 47 φ l n r t g l l 1 2 where r t 1 cos π t 2 t 2 t 2 t 1 t 2 t and t 2 π ω is the linear wave period we consider two identical rectangular cylinders in forced motions the breadth of each cylinder is 2b and its draught in undisturbed water is d in the simulations d is chosen to be b the centre lines of the two cylinders are located x c 1 l and x c 2 l respectively the nondimensional water depth is h d 10 both cylinders are subjected to the following sinusoidal oscillation in horizontal or vertical direction 48 δ a sin ω t where a is the oscillational amplitude and ω is the oscillational frequency in all simulations the default value of nondimensional amplitude a d 0 0125 if it is not assigned when there is no current the real resonant frequency is ω i c ω i i 1 2 wang and wu 2008 where c is a constant and can be obtained by numerical tests ω n is the resonant or natural frequency of a sloshing tank with 2 l b in width and great depth of water and it is expressed as 49 ω i i π 2 l b g i 1 2 wang and wu 2008 simulated vertical oscillations of two identical cylinders at resonant frequencies without a current the resonant motion occurs at the even natural frequencies ω 2 i i 1 2 or ω 2 i 2 i 1 2 in eq 49 in vertical motions we now consider some cases related to ω 2 as discussed in wang and wu 2008 the real resonant frequency is ω 2 1 01 ω 2 in the simulation the distance between the truncated surface s c and the origin point are four time linear wavelength there are 14 segments on s c and 50 segments on the still water surface outside both cylinders and 24 segments between them 6 segments are used on each cylinder wall and 12 segments on its bottom thus a mesh of 10163 nodes and 1928 elements are generated it should be noted that more nodes are required near the water surface and cylinder surface which can be carried out through an exponential function chung 2002 the time step is chosen to be dt t 200 we denote the left and right sides of cylinder one left cylinder as p l1 p r1 and those of cylinder two right cylinder as p l2 p r2 respectively fig 4 shows histories of waves at p r1 at ω 2 1 01 ω 2 together with those at 0 5 ω 2 0 9 ω 2 and 1 1 ω 2 results are provided only for cylinder one due to symmetry it is shown that the first order or linear runup always increases with the time and becomes very large at ω ω 2 and the second order wave runup also shows a similar variation with time at ω 0 5 ω 2 however both first and second order runups are quite small at ω 0 9 ω 2 and 1 1 ω 2 it is known from mentioned above that the runups between the two cylinders are abnormally large at the resonant frequency ω ω 2 or even at ω 0 5 ω 2 in the cases of no current we now consider some cases at ω ω 2 and froude number f n 0 064 0 128 to see how the current affects the wave the froude number f n is defined as f n u 0 g b comparisons are made for f n 0 0 064 and 0 128 and the results of waves at p r1 and p l2 are given in fig 5 it is seen from the figure that the runups at 0 064 is just a little smaller than that at f n 0 but it finally declines while the runup at f n 0 keeps increasing the runups at f n 0 128 however increase when t t 22 and then gradually decreases the maximum value of wave peaks within 50 cycles reaches to 20 2 at f n 0 17 2 at f n 0 064 and 9 0 at f n 0 128 for the wave at p r1 and 20 2 at f n 0 17 0 at f n 0 064 and 9 0 at f n 0 128 for the wave at p l2 respectively this is because the wave frequency without current or at f n 0 is identical to the oscilaltional or resonant frequency ω ω 2 however it is different from ω 2 at f n 0 064 and 0 128 a larger froude number lead to its wave frequency with current to be more deviated from that without current or the natural frequency and hence the runup at f n 0 128 become much smaller than that at f n 0 with the development of time numerical tests are now made to determine the oscillational frequencies ω 2 of both cylinders in a current when the resonance happens the result is given in fig 6 for f n 0 064 it is shown that ω 2 1 005 ω 2 is a better approximation since its wave runup is the largest similarly it is found that ω 2 0 99 ω 2 is the best for f n 0 128 which means that the oscillational frequency declines as the increase of the froude number a comparison of linear wave runups at f n 0 0 064 and 0 128 is given in fig 7 at their own oscillational frequencies ω 2 1 01 ω 2 1 005 ω 2 and 0 99 ω 2 respectively and it is found that the runups at f n 0 are the largest at both locations of p r1 p l2 and those at f n 0 128 are the smallest which indicates that the wave runup at each intersection point between cylinders decreases at resonance when froude number increases in these cases the linear wave and its superposition with the second order at f n 0 064 and 0 128 are given in fig 8 similar to the situation without current or f n 0 the second order wave is much smaller than the linear since it is the first order resonance fig 9 gives the corresponding forces acting on cylinder one at f n 0 0 064 and 0 128 similar to the linear wave the peaks or troughs of horizontal and vertical force components decrease as f n increases for both the linear and its superposition with the second order we can also see that the horizontal force has no visible difference between the linear and the superposition at each froude number the vertical forces are however clearly different between them this is because the horizontal force has bigger first order component and smaller second order component see fig 10 a and b at each f n relatively the first order component of vertical force is smaller and the second order is bigger see fig 10c and d it can also be seen from fig 9b d 9f that the superposition or linear plus second order obviously deviates from the linear and the difference is even clearer at smaller f n and hence has stronger nonlinearity and this indicates the nonlinearity of vertical force becomes weaker as the increase of froude number when resonance happens a comparison of linear hydrodynamic forces on cylinders one and two are depicted in fig 11 the forces on both cylinders has identical phase in the vertical direction and opposite phase in the horizontal when f n 0 see fig 11a and b due to symmetry the amplitude of horizontal force on cylinder one is a little smaller than that on cylinder two at f n 0 064 and 0 128 because the former becomes smaller and the latter becomes larger as f n increases in contrast to this the vertical force shows an opposite variation in addition the phases of forces in both horizontal and vertical direction clearly change with the f n due to the current effect similarity can be found for the second order forces on both cylinders in fig 12 the difference is the horizontal second order forces are always negative for cylinder one and positive for cylinder two fig 13 shows free surface profiles at f n 0 128 a d 0 05 from t 45t 45 5t with a time interval δ t 0 1 t t is the first order wave period without current in the figure λis the first order wave length without current similar to the situation at f n 0 the resonant waves for both linear and superposition of linear and second order between both cylinders are much larger than those outside the difference is that they are nonsymmetrical about x 0 at f n 0 128 due to the existence of current while they are symmetrical about x 0 at f n 0 in vertical motions the second order effect of the waves between cylinders is also seen to be evident through comparing fig 13b with 13a furthermore the doppler effect can be observed the wave length in the left region of cylinder one is shorter than that in the right region of cylinder two because the former is adverse to the current and the latter is coplanar to the current direction the work mentioned above is about the situation at the first order resonance we now consider second order resonance at oscillational frequencies ω 2 2 fig 14 shows the first and second order wave runups at p r1 p l2 with f n 0 0 064 and 0 128 in which k is the wave number which is obtained through solving equation ω k g tanh k h we can see from fig 14a and c that the amplitudes of linear wave at both locations almost remain constant and their corresponding phases are identical to each other at three froude numbers the second order waves shown in fig 14b and d however exhibit clear resonant characteristic at each froude number and the wave runup decreases as the froude number increases which is similar to those at the first order resonance shown in fig 7 further results for the total waves at p r1 are given in fig 15 the nonlinearity is quite strong at each froude number f n and it becomes weaker as f n increases since the second order wave runup becomes smaller as f n increases see fig 14b and d while the first order almost keeps unchanged see fig 14a and c fig 16 gives the corresponding hydrodynamic forces on cylinder one similar to the linear waves in fig 14a and c the amplitudes of linear components in both horizontal and vertical directions remain almost constant at each f n and there is a little discrepancy between different f n the second order force however keeps increasing with the development of time at each f n and decreases as f n increases fig 16b andd and fig 17 gives the corresponding linear and linear plus second order hydrodynamic forces on cylinder one compared with those at the first order resonance infig 9 their similarity and difference can be clearly seen comparisons of hydrodynamic forces on cylinders one and two are also made see fig 18 we give the results about the second order force only since the linear force almost remains constant at each f n when f n increases the amplitudes of force components in x and y direction decreases for each cylinder and they are smaller for cylinder two than those for cylinder one fig 19 shows wave profiles of the linear and its superposition with the second order from t 46t 50t with a time interval δt 0 1t at ω 2 2 the wave development with time can be clearly seen between both cylinders and outside of them it is observed that the linear and the superposed waves between both cylinders differ from each other at each froude number and they change as the increase of f n it can also be observed that the nonlinear effect of waves between both cylinders is very clear through comparing the linear and the superposed waves at each f n just like the first order resonance at ω 2 see fig 13 the linear and the superposed waves outside both cylinders also have clear doppler effect at larger f n smaller wave length larger wave amplitude within the left region of cylinder one and bigger wave length smaller wave amplitude within the right region of cylinder two further simulations have been made at oscillational frequencies ω ω 4 and ω ω 4 2 and the results are given in fig 20 numerical tests are made and it is found that ω 4 0 99 ω 4 0 96 ω 4 are good approximation for ω 4 at f n 0 0 064 and 0 128 respectively fig 20 gives the linear and second order waves at ω 4 and ω 4 2 the effect of current on them is very clear we know from above discussion that the wave and force generally become smaller as f n increases in the case at ω 4 2 the second order wave peaks and troughs are however are generally increase as f n increase which is obviously different from the situation at ω ω 2 2 see fig 14b d we also undertake some simulations at f n 0 064 and 0 128 which means a current toward the negative x direction numerical tests show their resonant frequencies are equal to their absolute values of froude number or f n 0 064 and 0 128 respectively the results are completely identical to those at f n 0 064 and 0 128 if we exchange cylinders one and two further simulations are made for both cylinders in horizontal motions or anti symmetrical swaying motions defined in eq 48 the first and second order resonances happens at ω ω 2 i 1 i 1 2 and ω ω 2 i 2 i 1 2 respectively wu 2007 as discussed in wang and wu 2008 the resonant or oscillational frequencies ω 1 1 068 ω 1 ω 2 1 01 ω 2 ω 3 ω 3 and ω 4 ω 4 when not considering current effect similar to aforementioned analysis in the vertical motions the oscillational frequencies ω i i 1 2 3 4 are a little different when the current is considered and they are summarized in table 1 at f n 0 0 064 0 128 through numerical tests fig 21 23 give results at ω ω 1 in the simulations we also consider some cases at f n 0 064 0 128 besides 0 0 064 0 128 similar to the vertical motions the linear waves at f n 0 are the largest and they generally decrease as the absolute value of f n increases for both cylinders shown in fig 21 fig 22 gives the corresponding linear forces on cylinders the variation of horizontal forces with f n resembles the situation of the first order wave however the amplitude of vertical force becomes larger as f n increases and it is largest at f n 0 128 fig 22b for cylinder one however its change with f n is opposite for cylinder two fig 22d the corresponding linear force and resultant force of linear and second order on cylinder one is given in fig 23 in which the results at f n 0 128 0 0 128 are given only the second order contribution to the total forces especially for the vertical component can be clearly seen the nonlinearity of force at f n 0 128 0 128 is stronger than that at f n 0 for horizontal component and is weaker for the vertical fig 24 gives the linear hydrodynamic forces on both cylinders at ω 3 it is seen that the difference between five froude numbers is very evident and the forces at f n 0 are the largest for both horizontal and vertical components fig 25 shows the second order waves at ω ω 2 2 and the corresponding second order forces on both cylinders are depicted in fig 26 it is also interesting to see that the amplitudes of second order waves at p r1 p l2 become larger with the increase of f n which is completely different from the situation in vertical motions shown in fig 14b and d however the second order forces on both cylinders generally become larger as the increase of the absolute value of f n also the force amplitudes on cylinder one at f n 0 064 0 128 are larger than those at f n 0 064 0 128 respectively while the situation is just opposite for cylinder two simulations are also made at ω ω 4 2 and the results are given in fig 27 the current effect on the second order force is also evident in this case the current causes dramatic drop in amplitude with the increase of the absolute value f n for the horizontal forces their maximum values are 3 39 21 0 33 1 18 7 2 44 for cylinder one and 3 47 21 5 36 2 24 0 4 2 for cylinder two at f n 0 128 0 064 0 0 064 0 128 respectively the work mentioned above is on the distance between two cylinders l 8b we also simulate some cases at different l some results are given in fig 28 30 for ω ω 2 in vertical motions and ω ω 1 in horizontal motions in the same direction fig 28 is the oscillational frequencies ω 2 ω 2 in vertical motions and ω 1 ω 1 in horizontal motions as functions of l b the oscillational frequency is generally linearly increases as l b increases for the horizontal motions within the whole range of l b and for the vertical motions when l b 6 and it is becomes smaller as f n increases at each l b fig 29 gives first order waves at p r1 at ω ω 2 and f n 0 0 064 0 128 with different l b and results in vertical motions are given only we can see that the wave amplitude at around l b 9 is the largest at each f n fig 30 gives corresponding first order forces on cylinder one and the horizontal component show similar variation to the wave given in fig 29 5 conclusions a second order theory has been employed to investigate wave resonance between two cylinders in specified motions in a steady current in time domain a higher order finite element method with 12 node element is employed in the simulation the i th i 0 1 2 order potentials are obtained through solving the finite element system based on the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm the shape functions are used to calculate each order derivatives with respect to the space in boundary conditions directly a damping zone method is used for satisfying the radiation condition numerical simulations have been made for two rectangular cylinders in free surface in vertical and horizontal motions in a steady current the wave and the hydrodynamic force have been computed at ω i i 1 2 3 4 and ω 2 i 2 i 1 2 at different current speeds and comparisons are made the current effect on wave and force has been analyzed and the nonlinearity of waves and forces for each cylinder has also been discussed the simulation shows the current has important influence on the waves and forces for the cylinders at resonant frequencies in both vertical and horizontal oscillations the amplitudes of wave and force at first order resonant frequencies are found to generally decrease as the froude number increases but not necessary for second order resonance such as the vertical motions at ω 4 2 and the horizontal motions at ω 2 2 their nonlinearities are also clearly affected by the current and they generally become weaker as froude number increases when resonance happens the effect of spacing between both cylinders on the waves and hydrodynamic forces at different froude numbers are also investigated at resonant frequencies and it is shown that the oscillational frequencies of cylinders generally increase as the increase of spacing when resonance happens all these have direct implications for the design ship and ocean structures with two or more bodies such as catamaran and other similar structures in a current acknowledgement this work is supported by the national natural
