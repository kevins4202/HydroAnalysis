14935,in recent years the concern with emerging pollutants in water has become more prominent especially pharmaceutical residues such as antibiotics due to the influence to increase antibacterial resistance further conventional wastewater treatment methods have not demonstrated efficiency for the complete degradation of these compounds or they have limitations to treat a large volume of waste in this sense this study aims to investigate the degradation of amoxicillin one of the most prescribed antibiotics in wastewater via supercritical water gasification scwg using a continuous flow reactor for this purpose the process operating conditions of temperature feed flow rate and concentration of h2o2 was evaluated using experimental design and response surface methodology techniques and optimized by differential evolution methodology total organic carbon toc removal chemical oxygen demand cod degradability reaction time amoxicillin degradation rate toxicity of degradation by products and gaseous products were evaluated the use of scwg for treatment achieved 78 4 of the toc removal for the industrial wastewater in the gaseous products hydrogen was the majority component furthermore high performance liquid chromatography analyses demonstrated that the antibiotic amoxicillin was degraded for a mass flow rate of 15 mg min of amoxicillin fed into the reaction system 14 4 mg min was degraded toxicity tests with microcrustacean artemia salina showed slight toxicity to treated wastewater despite that the outcomes reveal the scwg has great potential to degrade amoxicillin and may be applied to treat several pharmaceutical pollutants aside from this carbon rich effluents may lead to a significant energy gaseous product especially hydrogen and syngas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords industrial effluent pharmaceutical residues supercritical water wastewater treatment emergent pollutants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction amoxicillin is an antibiotic used to prevent and treat bacterial infections in humans the metabolic rate of amoxicillin is low and about 70 to 90 of this drug is released unchanged into the environment verma et al 2022 exposure to antibiotics stimulates bacterial resistance to antibiotics and consequently can cause inefficiency in the treatment of diseases and infections caused by bacteria pei et al 2019 in recent years the presence of antibiotics and their fragments has been determined in the environment specifically in drinking water zhong et al 2022 seas gonzález gaya et al 2018 fish xiao et al 2021 milk li et al 2021 food écija arenas et al 2021 hospital waste hassoun kheir et al 2020 water treatment plants sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 and sewage treatment plants zou et al 2022 thus under these circumstances antibiotics are considered emerging pollutants and their presence in the environment has negative impacts on human health and the ecosystem richardson and ternes 2022 emerging pollutants are synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals or any microorganisms that are not commonly monitored in the environment but have the potential to enter the environment and cause known or suspected adverse ecological and or human health effects rosenfeld and feng 2011 several methods involving physical chemical and biological processes have been used for the treatment of emerging pollutants among which are chlorination ultraviolet irradiation ozonation photocatalytic oxidation fenton reactions electrocatalysis adsorption separation membranes sandboxes bioreactors and etc akbari et al 2021 alnajrani and alsager 2020 brillas 2022 choudhary et al 2021 gadipelly et al 2014 li et al 2022 pei et al 2019 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 zou et al 2022 although several studies have successfully reported the use of these processes for the treatment of antibiotics at some point the application of these approaches present low degradability instability high cost benefit or are often unfeasible for large scale effluent treatment given this scenario it is necessary to develop efficient processes or even complement existing processes for the treatment of waste containing antibiotics the process of gasification by water in supercritical condition in other words supercritical water gasification scwg first reported in 1982 proved to be an excellent technology for the treatment of organic waste bermejo and cocero 2006 briefly scwg reactions occur between oxidizable materials and water at temperatures and pressures above the critical point of water 374 c and 25 mpa respectively tester et al 1993 this technology has been successfully applied for the treatment of a wide variety of effluents and sludges reaching high efficiency fast reaction complete degradation and clean products souza et al 2022 the treatment of wastewater contaminated with pharmaceutical pollutants using scwg is still few reported this amount is even smaller when restricted to the degradation of antibiotics by scwg the degradation of carbamazepine 90 5 metoprolol 99 9 and sulfamethoxazole 98 8 at temperatures of 350 c 400 c 300 c respectively was shown by falamarzian et al 2014 using batch reactor in the study by stavbar et al 2017 amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin were degraded by approximately 98 after treatment in a continuous flow reactor with a residence time of 60 min and a temperature of 500 c the degradation study of pharmaceutical industrial effluent that contained antifungals antibiotics and antipyretics was reported by mylapilli and reddy 2019 they achieved 97 8 of toc removal using a continuous flow reactor at 60 s 550 c and in the presence of 100 excess oxidant h2o2 in another case evaluating the degradation of hospital effluent in a continuous flow reactor 90 of removal was achieved for both total organic carbon toc and carbon organic demand cod for the 9 drugs determined in the effluent the highest removal rate was obtained for paracetamol 99 9 while the lowest removal rate was obtained for warfarin 72 removal rates for other pollutants such as carbamazepine ciprofloxacin cyclophosphamide ampicillin naproxen diclofenac and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate ranged from 73 to 97 6 top et al 2020 in view of this panorama studies that evaluate the degradation of antibiotics using scwg in particular amoxicillin were reported a few times in the literature pollutants mechanisms of degradations using scwg are an area of study with many gaps and little understanding since the chemistry involved in the process is quite complex despite that chen et al 2023 have proposed detailed mechanisms of amoxicillin degradation by molecular dynamics simulation although some authors have reported success for antibiotic degradation some aspects can be improved and vigorously evaluated such as drug degradation rates toc and cod degradability reaction time the toxicity of degradation by products and evaluation of real effluent to reiterate the outcome achieved in the tests with an aqueous solution another relevant aspect is the evaluation of the gasses produced during the treatment process therefore in view of these gaps we sought to evaluate and systematize the use of scwg in the treatment of aqueous residue simulated with amoxicillin then the optimized process was applied in the treatment of industrial pharmaceutical wastewater containing the antibiotic amoxicillin related to the treatment process it showed temperature residence time related to feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration effects in the toc removal results reiterated the potential of scwg technology applied for wastewater treatment containing amoxicillin beyond producing gaseous with energetic value 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemical reagents the reagents used were acetonitrile neon brazil phosphoric acid êxodo científica brazil amoxicillin 500 mg readily available at drug stores unichem farmacêutica do brasil ltda brazil amoxicillin trihydrate 98 9 laboratorio teuto brasileiro s a brazil and hydrogen peroxide 30 êxodo científica brazil industrial wastewater initial toc 477 3 mg l collected exclusively from the antibiotic production line was supplied by a local pharmaceutical industry 16 23 25 6128 s 48 56 22 6068 w 2 2 preparation of simulated wastewater to simulate an extreme case of contamination the wastewater solution was prepared with commercial pills of amoxicillin to reach the final concentration of 1000 mg l of the active ingredient then the solution was filtered to remove magnesium stearate which was the only excipient presented in the pill the concentration of oxidizing agent h2o2 added as a promoter to induce oxidation was evaluated during the treatment process for that h2o2 was previously added to the feed solution before entering the reaction system in a range of concentration from 0 to 100 w w related to amoxicillin concentration the maximum h2o2 concentration used equivalent to oxidation coefficient 0 7 is lower than the stoichiometric amount of oxidant o2 required for the complete oxidation of amoxicillin all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 0 0 2 mω cm at 25 c millipore milli q usa 2 3 reaction unit reaction tests were carried out in a continuous flow reactor system at a pressure of 25 mpa the components of the reaction unit are detailed in fig 1 adapted from ribeiro et al 2021 they are a high pressure isocratic pump agilent technologies 1260 to introduce sample into the system a helical preheater composed of a split furnace a reactor which is a tube in inconel 625 l 30 cm id 1 1 cm also heated by a split furnace to reach the desired reaction temperatures a helical heat exchanger a back pressure regulator swagelok and a phase separator where products in both liquid and gaseous phases were collected the heat exchanger and phase separator were cooled by water circulation using a thermostatic bath cole parmer polystat with a temperature set at 5 c liquid flow rates correspond to the accumulation of fluid over time and gas flow rates were measured using a glass bubble meter all measurements and product collections were performed after the reaction system reached a steady state it is important to note that measurements were performed in the ambient conditions of goiania 16 36 11 1492 s 49 15 43 2684 w however to standardize the measurements the parameters established by the standard ambient temperature and pressure satp were considered which are 25 c and 1 013 bar respectively apart from the reactor the other components of the reaction system preheater condenser phase separator and other connections are made of 316 stainless steels 2 4 experimental conditions and central composite design initially experimental tests were performed using the simulated effluent for that the central composite design was used to evaluate the effects and interactions of temperature t feed flow rate f and h2o2 concentration c parameters on the toc removal the parameters were chosen for the following reasons i temperature is significant for organic matter oxidation and or gasification even above the supercritical point as supported by various studies casademont et al 2020 ghasemi et al 2022 ii feed flow rate is linked to the residence time of the work solution inside the reactor iii the concentrations of h2o2 because it is an aid in organic matter degradation the intervals for each parameter investigated were defined based on the operating capacity of the reaction unit respecting the upper and lower limits of temperature feed flow rate and oxidant concentration that do not compromise the stability of the system therefore the temperature feed flow rate and concentration of h2o2 rage screened were 287 683 c 5 1 24 9 ml min and 0 0 94 5 w w in relation to the amoxicillin mass respectively combined with that response surface methodology was used to evaluate the profiles of the parameters studied in the response the experimental conditions based on the central composite design for three variables presented 18 configurations divided into 8 factorial points 6 axial points α 1 41 and 4 repetitions of the central point the parameter s significance was determined by an analysis of variance anova using the software r version 4 1 2 variables were evaluated considering their influence on the response with a 90 confidence level p 0 10 2 5 optimization of the oxidation process the differential evolution algorithm methodology was used to maximize the toc remotion for that this approach whose population based optimization inspired by darwin s theory of evolution was used to solve the reduced quadratic model equation obtained from experimental tests designed by central composite design thus an adapted version of the code developed by vieira et al 2011 was used the code implementation took place in software scilab 6 0 2 the classic de rand 1 bin method was used and the parameters were defined as population size n of 50 individuals disturbance rate fr of 0 8 crossover probability cr of 0 8 and as a stopping criterion the reach of 250 generations 2 6 chemical

chromatography gc high resolution mass spectrometry nitrite nitrate and sulfate determinations all equipment details and methods used are reported in supplementary material 2 7 toxicity test with brine shrimp artemia salina the effects of the treatment process were evaluated by toxicity tests using artemia salina in a short term analysis in relation to mortality assays were performed according to the method described by meyer et al 1982 with adaptations artemia salina eggs 50 mg supplied by maramarpet rio de janeiro brazil were incubated in a glass container filled with 1 l of artificial saline water in the presence of light for a period of 48 h the artificial saline solution was prepared with natural mineral water supplied by pura goias brazil and 0 035 w v of cooking salt supplied by dunas rio grande do norte brazil the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 with the addition of 0 1 mol l naoh after hatching ten crustaceans were transferred using a pipette to a test tube with artificial saline water then samples were added into a tube whose preparation consisted of dilution in ultrapure water to make up concentrations of 0 25 50 75 and 100 v v for a total volume of 10 ml to make it clear raw and treated effluent was investigated both in five concentration levels where 100 v v corresponds to the sample without dilution assays were performed in triplicate and monitored by a negative control ultrapure water crustaceans were counted after 24 h those that were sedimented and without movement were considered dead toxicity was expressed as the mean lethal concentration necessary to kill 50 of a population of crustaceans tested lc50 for that reason mortality data were analyzed statistically via probit usepa 2002 in addition a pearson chi square test was performed to assess meaningful differences from the control test all analyzes were performed in r software version 4 1 2 using the function code described by pacheco et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated wastewater 3 1 1 effect of multivariate conditions of process on the total organic carbon removal and gas production the efficiency of the treatment process was evaluated with the goal of optimizing temperature t feed flow rate f and concentration of h2o2 c conditions to maximize organic matter degradation for this reason the rate of total organic carbon removal rtoc was the parameter considered for evaluating the process efficiency as this covers amoxicillin degradation damox which has also been evaluated which were defined using eqs 1 and 2 1 r t o c 1 t o c o u t t o c i n x 100 2 d a m o x 1 d o u t d i n x 100 where t o c i n and t o c o u t are the total organic concentrations of wastewater samples at the inlet and outlet of the reaction system respectively to refer to amoxicillin concentrations in inlet and outlet d i n and d o u t were termed to understand the effect of multivariate conditions on the treatment process 18 tests designed by composite central design were performed using pharmaceutical industry simulated wastewater the results achieved are shown in table 1 based on the experimental data presented the reduced quadratic polynomial regression model that predicts the rtoc as a function of the independent variables decoded is given in eq 3 regression coefficients of linear temperature t and quadratic temperature t2 were significant p 0 10 along with feed flow rate f and h2o2 concentration c also a slight linear interaction between feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration was noted fc the coefficients values of the mathematical model that reflect experimental results are displayed in table s1 in the supplementary material the p value of model was satisfactorily meaningful p 3 931 10 6 with multiple r squared of 0 9182 3 r toc 66 426 0 157 t 1 513 f 0 065 c 0 012 fc 0 0002 t 2 anova results for rtoc show a p value of the lack of fit of 0 0012 that replies to the reliability of the model and combined with the r2 value indicates that 91 82 of the data variability for this reaction unity and within the range of the parameters assessed can be expressed by the model this enhances the model is reasonably adequate since the process involves complex and diverse reactions as shown in table 2 furthermore statistical analysis revealed random and independent residuals with a normal distribution in other words a mean of zero and constant variance the histogram of distribution can be seen in fig s1 the response surface method was used to grasp the effects of process experimental conditions using eq 3 the behavior of toc removal in the function of three multivariable was assessed considering the third variable at the central level consequently three situations were deemed as shown in fig 2 in the first situation the response surface for the rtoc was considered with concentration at the central level as shown in fig 2a the temperature was the variable with the most significant effect on the response its increase enhanced the treatment while the feed flow rate increase led to a decrease in rtoc as expected higher feed flow rates lead to decreased reactor residence time thus the rtoc reduces together with reaction time in the second situation analyzing the response surface for the rtoc assuming the feed flow rate at the central level fig 2b it can be observed that the oxidation of organic matter was favored by the increase in temperature and concentration of h2o2 the use of h2o2 as an oxidation inducer demonstrated an increase of approximately 24 in the treatment efficiency in the third situation the response surface for the rtoc is analyzed considering the temperature at the central level fig 2c the oxidation of organic matter was favored when operating conditions of lower feed flow rate and higher h2o2 concentration were used it was also possible to reach the same rtoc using low flow rate and low h2o2 concentration that is to say that the increase in residence time associated with low h2o2 content also favored oxidation degradation therefore it is noted that the presence of oxidizing agent was not the most significant effect which may be a direct result of the short range of h2o2 concentration evaluated at the last the temperature was the variable with the most significant effect on the oxidation of organic matter followed by the feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration the effect of multivariate conditions of process in the gas production also was observed considering that the removal of organic matter in the liquid phase is directly associated with gasification table 3 shows the results of molar fraction and volumetric flow for the gaseous products the highest molar fractions were determined for hydrogen followed by carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide ethane ethylene and methane had very low and even negligible molar fractions the highest volumetric flows were determined for tests 4 8 12 and 14 where temperatures of 625 625 683 and 485 c respectively for these same tests h2o2 concentrations of 13 9 80 7 47 3 and 47 3 respectively these results reveal that the increase in temperature combined with the presence of h2o2 favored the oxidation process due to the action of hydroxyl radicals and consequently the gasification of organic matter the smallest volumetric flows were determined for tests 1 5 and 13 where temperatures of 345 345 and 485 c were used respectively the low temperatures associated with low feed flow rates justify the low gas produced the production of gasses involves a complex process which occurs through a sequence of physical transformations and chemical reactions inside the reactor the organic matter suffers oxidation due to the presence of radical species in the reaction medium then the remaining organic material reacts with co2 and steam to produce co and h2 hantoko et al 2018 wei et al 2021 the overall simplified gasification reaction is given in the chemical equation below 4 chxoy 2 y h2o co2 2 y x 2 h2 before that simultaneous reactions can take place in the gaseous phase including water gas shift eq 5 steam reforming eq 6 and dry reforming by co2 eq 7 which can have favored h2 production the predominance of a specific reaction can depend on the process conditions such as temperature pressure mean residence time reagent availability and catalyst characteristic if applicable 5 co h2o co2 h2 6 ch4 h2o 2co 3h2 7 ch4 co2 co 3h2 hydrogen selectivity was predominant in all tests in test 1 both the selectivity for h2 and co2 were approximately equal due to the low temperature and low flow rate 8 n ml min in test 5 carried out at a temperature of 287 c and a feed rate of 15 n ml min the selectivity for co was greater than for co2 in contrast to the other tests this fact is due to the increase in feed flow rate which decreases the residence time furthermore the reverse water gas displacement reaction may have been favored in subcritical condition susanti et al 2014 tests 15 and 16 were performed at the same temperature and feed flow rate 485 c and 15 ml min respectively in these tests the minimum 0 and maximum 94 5 h2o2 concentrations were investigated the results showed that the concentration of h2o2 had no significant effect on the volumetric flow of the gaseous products on the other hand it was observed that this independent variable impacts the selectivity of the gasses produced the presence of h2o2 caused a reduction of h2 production and an increase in the production of co2 this is due to the action of the hydroxyl radicals of the oxidant which tend to complete oxidation degradation of organic matter leading to the formation of only carbon dioxide and water he et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 3 1 2 optimization of total organic carbon removal the treatment process using scwg was optimized to determine the best conditions of temperature feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration to reach the maximum of rtoc for this reason the reduced quadratic model eq 3 which predicts the rtoc was applied to the code of the search algorithm for differential evolution developed by vieira et al 2011 the results of the optimization study found the following optimal operating conditions temperature 682 c flow rate 5 1 ml min and h2o2 9 2 w w the rtoc calculated was 65 02 the confirmatory experiment carried out at the optimum condition achieved a rtoc of 60 1 which means a relative error of approximately 8 between calculated and predicted responses thus the model proved to be adequate in describing the behavior of multivariable parameters in the degradation of organic matter related to amoxicillin moreover within acceptable error since this process involves numerous chemical reactions of high complexity the results corroborate with the profile shown by the response surface graphs where it was evidenced that carbon oxidation is favored by high temperatures low feed flow rates and low h2o2 concentrations with a significance level exactly in that order that said the validation of this model is reiterated considering the evaluated limits 3 1 3 degradation of antibiotic amoxicillin regarding amoxicillin degradation the industry wastewater simulated treated by scwg was analyzed by hplc uv calibration curve and typical chromatogram of analysis are displayed in fig s2 results are shown in table 1 as can be seen damox for all tests were higher than 90 that suggest potentiality of the treatment process to degrade amoxicillin moreover enhancing the evidence of antibiotic degradation high resolution mass spectrometry analyzes were performed fig 3 shows the spectra of untreated and treated samples the results show a complex spectrum with numerous fragments in the untreated sample the low intensity signal with a m z ratio of 388 09 was assign to amoxicillin c16h19o5n3nas in the form of sodium adduct m na as can be seen in fig 3a the presence of the ion c15 13ch20o5n3s at m z of 367 11 in the spectrum which corresponds to the natural proportion of 13c in the amoxicillin molecule was decisive to confirm the determination of amoxicillin in the untreated samples after scwg treatment a significant reduction in the fragmentation profile was observed and amoxicillin was not detected fig 3b the lowest and highest damox was observed in entries 3 and 12 table 1 respectively run 3 reaction was performed with an h2o2 concentration 13 9 a feed flow rate of 22 ml min and a temperature of 345 c run 12 reaction was performed with an h2o2 concentration of 47 3 a temperature of 683 c and a feed flow rate of 15 0 ml min this indicates that temperature is the most influential parameter for the oxidation and or degradation of amoxicillin thus considering the best result of degradation run 12 and that the inlet solution concentration was 1000 mg l of amoxicillin it was observed that for an amoxicillin mass flow rate of 15 mg min fed into the reaction system 14 4 mg min of antibiotic was degraded dogan and kidak 2016 investigated the oxidation of amoxicillin based on uv and uv h2o2 radiation into a plug flow reactor with a volume of 680 cm3 the higher damox was obtained using uv h2o2 a solution with an amoxicillin concentration of 25 mg l reached damox of 92 corresponds to 23 mg degradation per l and rtoc of 55 after 67 min of treatment thus amoxicillin was processed at approximately 0 23 mg min the treatment of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin using scwg in a continuous flow reactor l 2 m v 4 6 ml was shown by stavbar et al 2017 the concentration for both antibiotics was 80 μg l results showed that the best treatment conditions occurred at a temperature of 500 c and a flow rate of 5 ml min under these conditions the concentrations of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin decreased to 21 and 28 ng l respectively thus an approximate rate of processing degradation for both antibiotics was 79 9 μg min despite demonstrating efficiency in the treatment of antibiotics especially for amoxicillin both the process using photodegradation and scwg showed a relatively low degradation rate compared to the processing performance presented by this study which was 14 4 mg min dogan and kidak 2016 stavbar et al 2017 3 2 industry pharmaceutical wastewater 3 2 1 treatment of wastewater and chemical characterization the wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry was treated via scwg at the optimized operational conditions of temperature feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration 682 c 5 1 ml min and 9 2 w w respectively results of sample characterization before and after treatment were compared with environmental agency s regulations that play a role in wastewater and water quality of treatment such as companhia de desenvolvimento econômico de goiás codego 2016 conselho nacional do meio ambiente conama 2011 european environment agency eea 2018 and united states environmental agency usepa 2020 comparison details can be found in table s2 in short after treatment toc concentrations decreased from 543 0 to 116 6 mg l which means a rtoc of 78 4 national legislation conama and codego does not establish any parameter related to the toc content on the other hand the eea indicates that no less than 95 of removal must occur for the effluent to be disposed of in a collection network in this regard the treatment was not sufficient to comply with this regulation it is worth mentioning in this case that an adjustment of the residence time either by reducing the feed flow rate or by increasing the dimensions of the reactor will possibly lead to compliance with the regulations and complete organic matter degradation nonetheless such alternatives have not been tested due to technical operational limitations the results showed a significant reduction in cod after treatment the cod concentration decreased from 7300 to 719 mg l representing a 90 reduction this value agrees with codego s regional legislation as expected nitrate nitrite and sulfate concentrations had significant decay after treatment this can be explained due to the low solubility of inorganic compounds in a medium containing water in a supercritical condition and consequently favoring the precipitation of salts and oxides he et al 2014 in summary metals analysis revealed low concentrations for the treated effluent with reservations regarding molybdenum nickel and titanium concentrations which had a significant increase although that their concentrations agree with the parameters established by the legislation this concentration increase is due to the wear of the reaction system used in the treatment process given that boron molybdenum and nickel make up the metal alloy used in the manufacture of the reactor stainless steel vcr 625 the increase in selenium and boron concentrations is also related to the mechanical wear suffered by other parts of the reaction system in this case 316 stainless steels it is common for these metals to be used in the composition of 316 stainless steel to improve machinability and strength xu and guo 2022 samples of untreated and treated industrial effluent were analyzed by direct injection in a high resolution mass spectrometer the results revealed the presence of the antibiotics amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin in raw effluent which correspond to the signals detected at m z of 366 11 and 332 14 respectively as can be seen in fig 4 after treatment via scwg it was observed reduction in the number of detected peaks showing a cleaner spectrum furthermore the peaks that remained after the treatment process had a significant reduction in intensity such as the signals at m z 333 23 317 24 and 301 40 which indicate the degradation of organic molecules corroborating the results of toc removal on the other hand the signal intensity at m z 241 06 increased in the treated effluent possibly due to the break of antibiotic molecules into a common fragment however this signal could not be accurately correlated to any molecular formula assigned by the xcalibur software the fragments that had the highest intensity and attribution of m z ratios with a deviation less than 3 ppm from the measured mass in relation to the theoretical mass had their molecular formula shown in table s3 given the complexity of the samples the interpretation of the spectra by means of deduction considering the fragmentation route is not feasible 3 2 2 evaluation of toxic activity in the brine shrimp artemia salina toxicity bioassays investigate the effects of a chemical on a living organism in this study the effluent contaminated with antibiotics from the pharmaceutical industry was evaluated against the microcrustacean artemia salina various toxicity tests with brine shrimp are commonly used including methods to assess short and long term effects libralato et al 2016 the use of brine shrimp in toxicity tests has been frequently applied in the evaluation of various chemical substances there are reports of this type of bioassay used successfully in the study of antibiotics nanomaterials plant extracts drugs effluents oils pesticides phenolic compounds and phthalates pecoraro et al 2021 reddy and osborne 2020 thiagarajan et al 2022 thus considering these reports brine shrimp were used to evaluate the toxicity of industrial effluent treated by scwg the results are shown in table 4 the experimental data allowed the calculation of lc50 for brine shrimp exposed to effluent for 24 h the results revealed high lethality for brine shrimp these microcrustaceans had 50 of the dead population lc50 when exposed to a concentration of 4 2 v v of antibiotic wastewater as shown in table 4 this result was calculated with 95 confidence intervals 15 degrees of freedom the goodness of fit was a chi square χ2 of 62 31 and a p value of 2 41 10 28 after treatment the lc50 increased from 4 2 to 12 3 which means an increase of 293 in the lethal concentration thus there was a reduction in toxicity in other words lc50 is inversely proportional to toxicity a substance with a lower lc50 is more toxic than one with a higher lc50 the lc50 of the treated effluent was calculated with confidence intervals of 95 and upper and lower limits of 3 41 and 20 95 respectively the goodness of fit was calculated with 15 degrees of freedom the χ2 value was 64 08 and the p value was 8 59 10 17 despite being treated the effluent is still highly toxic to brine shrimp this toxicity may be related to the amoxicillin degradation by products since the maximum of rtoc was 78 4 the absence of amoxicillin in the mass spectrometry results for treated samples further supports this possibility it is crucial to reiterate that introducing an excess of oxidizing agent reducing the feed flow rate or enlarging the reactor dimensions may result in the complete removal of total organic carbon and consequently lead to a notable reduction in toxicity levels thiagarajan et al 2022 evaluated the toxicity of tio2 nanoparticles associated with the antibiotic tetracycline against artemia salina this combination has been evaluated due to the increasing use of nanomaterials and pharmaceuticals that are uninterruptedly released into the marine ecosystem and represent a serious concern the reported results indicated that the presence of tetracycline additively increased the toxic effects of nanoparticles on brine shrimp alone tetracycline intermediates accounted for 28 7 3 5 of microcrustacean mortality thiagarajan et al 2022 although this parallel is made by comparing only the antibiotic tetracycline to other antibiotics and pollutants present in industrial effluent it can be inferred that antibiotics have an impact on toxicity consequently this factor can increase mortality rates 3 2 3 analysis of the gaseous product the composition of the gaseous product generated during the industrial effluent treatment process was evaluated and the results are shown in fig 5 the effluent was treated under the optimal conditions of temperature feed flow rate and concentration of h2o2 682 c 5 1 ml min and 9 2 w w respectively under such treatment conditions the gasses carbon dioxide ethane ethylene hydrogen methane and carbon monoxide were determined without the presence of any other unidentified peak in the chromatograms hydrogen was the major constituent and represented 37 68 of the molar fraction of the gasses produced the composition of c1 type compounds was superior to that of c2 type compounds this indicates that although total mineralization of organic compounds and complete gasification have not occurred this treatment process demonstrates a great capacity for oxidation in the conversion of complex molecules into simpler molecules furthermore the total volumetric flow of gasses was approximately 6 45 n ml min a reasonable value since the feed flow was only 5 1 ml min and both the cod and toc values in the industrial effluent samples indicate a low number of organic compounds susceptible to gasification in this study although it was not possible to provide a mass balance for the process due to the analytical complexity quali and quantitative determination a carbon balance to verify the process data accuracy was performed considering the optimal treatment condition for this purpose the carbon amount of the inlet liquid phase and outlet both liquid and gaseous phase of the process were considered as shown in table 5 results show a slight increase in the mass after the process which is inconsistent with the principles of mass conservation such a discrepancy could be a sign of process fluctuation wherein measurements were taken during a system pulse and carbon inside the reactor was released in any case the carbon balance error 2 was deemed acceptable and it might also reflect the experimental measurement errors the molar ratios of h2 co2 and h2 co were approximately 2 and 2 9 respectively according to the national energy technology laboratory netl under the united states department of energy in such proportions of composition this gas can be used as synthesis gas to produce methanol hydrogen and combustible gasses netl 2022 thus it appears that this technology applied to the treatment of this effluent showed efficiency to gasify the organic matter while synthesis gas was produced 4 conclusion the use of scwg technology under optimized conditions for the response rtoc 682 c 5 1 ml min and 9 2 w w for temperature feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration respectively it was efficient for amoxicillin degradation despite the rtoc achieved being only 60 1 the damox varied between 90 85 and 99 99 in the 18 experimental tests performed in a sample of effluent from the pharmaceutical industry after scwg treatment the rtoc was 78 4 in addition most of the criteria that attest to the quality of water are following the established by regulatory agencies however toxicity tests against artemia salina revealed high toxicity for these microcrustaceans among the gaseous products hydrogen gas was the major component and represented 37 68 of the total molar fraction the total volumetric flow of gasses was approximately 6 45 n ml min thus the supercritical water oxidation technology proved to be efficient for the degradation of the antibiotic amoxicillin with potential for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluent in addition the amount of amoxicillin processed per minute 14 4 mg min is an advantage that deserves to be highlighted when compared to other treatment techniques therefore the results revealed that the application of scwg is a promising

14935,in recent years the concern with emerging pollutants in water has become more prominent especially pharmaceutical residues such as antibiotics due to the influence to increase antibacterial resistance further conventional wastewater treatment methods have not demonstrated efficiency for the complete degradation of these compounds or they have limitations to treat a large volume of waste in this sense this study aims to investigate the degradation of amoxicillin one of the most prescribed antibiotics in wastewater via supercritical water gasification scwg using a continuous flow reactor for this purpose the process operating conditions of temperature feed flow rate and concentration of h2o2 was evaluated using experimental design and response surface methodology techniques and optimized by differential evolution methodology total organic carbon toc removal chemical oxygen demand cod degradability reaction time amoxicillin degradation rate toxicity of degradation by products and gaseous products were evaluated the use of scwg for treatment achieved 78 4 of the toc removal for the industrial wastewater in the gaseous products hydrogen was the majority component furthermore high performance liquid chromatography analyses demonstrated that the antibiotic amoxicillin was degraded for a mass flow rate of 15 mg min of amoxicillin fed into the reaction system 14 4 mg min was degraded toxicity tests with microcrustacean artemia salina showed slight toxicity to treated wastewater despite that the outcomes reveal the scwg has great potential to degrade amoxicillin and may be applied to treat several pharmaceutical pollutants aside from this carbon rich effluents may lead to a significant energy gaseous product especially hydrogen and syngas graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords industrial effluent pharmaceutical residues supercritical water wastewater treatment emergent pollutants data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction amoxicillin is an antibiotic used to prevent and treat bacterial infections in humans the metabolic rate of amoxicillin is low and about 70 to 90 of this drug is released unchanged into the environment verma et al 2022 exposure to antibiotics stimulates bacterial resistance to antibiotics and consequently can cause inefficiency in the treatment of diseases and infections caused by bacteria pei et al 2019 in recent years the presence of antibiotics and their fragments has been determined in the environment specifically in drinking water zhong et al 2022 seas gonzález gaya et al 2018 fish xiao et al 2021 milk li et al 2021 food écija arenas et al 2021 hospital waste hassoun kheir et al 2020 water treatment plants sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 and sewage treatment plants zou et al 2022 thus under these circumstances antibiotics are considered emerging pollutants and their presence in the environment has negative impacts on human health and the ecosystem richardson and ternes 2022 emerging pollutants are synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals or any microorganisms that are not commonly monitored in the environment but have the potential to enter the environment and cause known or suspected adverse ecological and or human health effects rosenfeld and feng 2011 several methods involving physical chemical and biological processes have been used for the treatment of emerging pollutants among which are chlorination ultraviolet irradiation ozonation photocatalytic oxidation fenton reactions electrocatalysis adsorption separation membranes sandboxes bioreactors and etc akbari et al 2021 alnajrani and alsager 2020 brillas 2022 choudhary et al 2021 gadipelly et al 2014 li et al 2022 pei et al 2019 sanganyado and gwenzi 2019 zou et al 2022 although several studies have successfully reported the use of these processes for the treatment of antibiotics at some point the application of these approaches present low degradability instability high cost benefit or are often unfeasible for large scale effluent treatment given this scenario it is necessary to develop efficient processes or even complement existing processes for the treatment of waste containing antibiotics the process of gasification by water in supercritical condition in other words supercritical water gasification scwg first reported in 1982 proved to be an excellent technology for the treatment of organic waste bermejo and cocero 2006 briefly scwg reactions occur between oxidizable materials and water at temperatures and pressures above the critical point of water 374 c and 25 mpa respectively tester et al 1993 this technology has been successfully applied for the treatment of a wide variety of effluents and sludges reaching high efficiency fast reaction complete degradation and clean products souza et al 2022 the treatment of wastewater contaminated with pharmaceutical pollutants using scwg is still few reported this amount is even smaller when restricted to the degradation of antibiotics by scwg the degradation of carbamazepine 90 5 metoprolol 99 9 and sulfamethoxazole 98 8 at temperatures of 350 c 400 c 300 c respectively was shown by falamarzian et al 2014 using batch reactor in the study by stavbar et al 2017 amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin were degraded by approximately 98 after treatment in a continuous flow reactor with a residence time of 60 min and a temperature of 500 c the degradation study of pharmaceutical industrial effluent that contained antifungals antibiotics and antipyretics was reported by mylapilli and reddy 2019 they achieved 97 8 of toc removal using a continuous flow reactor at 60 s 550 c and in the presence of 100 excess oxidant h2o2 in another case evaluating the degradation of hospital effluent in a continuous flow reactor 90 of removal was achieved for both total organic carbon toc and carbon organic demand cod for the 9 drugs determined in the effluent the highest removal rate was obtained for paracetamol 99 9 while the lowest removal rate was obtained for warfarin 72 removal rates for other pollutants such as carbamazepine ciprofloxacin cyclophosphamide ampicillin naproxen diclofenac and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate ranged from 73 to 97 6 top et al 2020 in view of this panorama studies that evaluate the degradation of antibiotics using scwg in particular amoxicillin were reported a few times in the literature pollutants mechanisms of degradations using scwg are an area of study with many gaps and little understanding since the chemistry involved in the process is quite complex despite that chen et al 2023 have proposed detailed mechanisms of amoxicillin degradation by molecular dynamics simulation although some authors have reported success for antibiotic degradation some aspects can be improved and vigorously evaluated such as drug degradation rates toc and cod degradability reaction time the toxicity of degradation by products and evaluation of real effluent to reiterate the outcome achieved in the tests with an aqueous solution another relevant aspect is the evaluation of the gasses produced during the treatment process therefore in view of these gaps we sought to evaluate and systematize the use of scwg in the treatment of aqueous residue simulated with amoxicillin then the optimized process was applied in the treatment of industrial pharmaceutical wastewater containing the antibiotic amoxicillin related to the treatment process it showed temperature residence time related to feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration effects in the toc removal results reiterated the potential of scwg technology applied for wastewater treatment containing amoxicillin beyond producing gaseous with energetic value 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and chemical reagents the reagents used were acetonitrile neon brazil phosphoric acid êxodo científica brazil amoxicillin 500 mg readily available at drug stores unichem farmacêutica do brasil ltda brazil amoxicillin trihydrate 98 9 laboratorio teuto brasileiro s a brazil and hydrogen peroxide 30 êxodo científica brazil industrial wastewater initial toc 477 3 mg l collected exclusively from the antibiotic production line was supplied by a local pharmaceutical industry 16 23 25 6128 s 48 56 22 6068 w 2 2 preparation of simulated wastewater to simulate an extreme case of contamination the wastewater solution was prepared with commercial pills of amoxicillin to reach the final concentration of 1000 mg l of the active ingredient then the solution was filtered to remove magnesium stearate which was the only excipient presented in the pill the concentration of oxidizing agent h2o2 added as a promoter to induce oxidation was evaluated during the treatment process for that h2o2 was previously added to the feed solution before entering the reaction system in a range of concentration from 0 to 100 w w related to amoxicillin concentration the maximum h2o2 concentration used equivalent to oxidation coefficient 0 7 is lower than the stoichiometric amount of oxidant o2 required for the complete oxidation of amoxicillin all solutions were prepared with ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18 0 0 2 mω cm at 25 c millipore milli q usa 2 3 reaction unit reaction tests were carried out in a continuous flow reactor system at a pressure of 25 mpa the components of the reaction unit are detailed in fig 1 adapted from ribeiro et al 2021 they are a high pressure isocratic pump agilent technologies 1260 to introduce sample into the system a helical preheater composed of a split furnace a reactor which is a tube in inconel 625 l 30 cm id 1 1 cm also heated by a split furnace to reach the desired reaction temperatures a helical heat exchanger a back pressure regulator swagelok and a phase separator where products in both liquid and gaseous phases were collected the heat exchanger and phase separator were cooled by water circulation using a thermostatic bath cole parmer polystat with a temperature set at 5 c liquid flow rates correspond to the accumulation of fluid over time and gas flow rates were measured using a glass bubble meter all measurements and product collections were performed after the reaction system reached a steady state it is important to note that measurements were performed in the ambient conditions of goiania 16 36 11 1492 s 49 15 43 2684 w however to standardize the measurements the parameters established by the standard ambient temperature and pressure satp were considered which are 25 c and 1 013 bar respectively apart from the reactor the other components of the reaction system preheater condenser phase separator and other connections are made of 316 stainless steels 2 4 experimental conditions and central composite design initially experimental tests were performed using the simulated effluent for that the central composite design was used to evaluate the effects and interactions of temperature t feed flow rate f and h2o2 concentration c parameters on the toc removal the parameters were chosen for the following reasons i temperature is significant for organic matter oxidation and or gasification even above the supercritical point as supported by various studies casademont et al 2020 ghasemi et al 2022 ii feed flow rate is linked to the residence time of the work solution inside the reactor iii the concentrations of h2o2 because it is an aid in organic matter degradation the intervals for each parameter investigated were defined based on the operating capacity of the reaction unit respecting the upper and lower limits of temperature feed flow rate and oxidant concentration that do not compromise the stability of the system therefore the temperature feed flow rate and concentration of h2o2 rage screened were 287 683 c 5 1 24 9 ml min and 0 0 94 5 w w in relation to the amoxicillin mass respectively combined with that response surface methodology was used to evaluate the profiles of the parameters studied in the response the experimental conditions based on the central composite design for three variables presented 18 configurations divided into 8 factorial points 6 axial points α 1 41 and 4 repetitions of the central point the parameter s significance was determined by an analysis of variance anova using the software r version 4 1 2 variables were evaluated considering their influence on the response with a 90 confidence level p 0 10 2 5 optimization of the oxidation process the differential evolution algorithm methodology was used to maximize the toc remotion for that this approach whose population based optimization inspired by darwin s theory of evolution was used to solve the reduced quadratic model equation obtained from experimental tests designed by central composite design thus an adapted version of the code developed by vieira et al 2011 was used the code implementation took place in software scilab 6 0 2 the classic de rand 1 bin method was used and the parameters were defined as population size n of 50 individuals disturbance rate fr of 0 8 crossover probability cr of 0 8 and as a stopping criterion the reach of 250 generations 2 6 chemical

brine shrimp artemia salina the effects of the treatment process were evaluated by toxicity tests using artemia salina in a short term analysis in relation to mortality assays were performed according to the method described by meyer et al 1982 with adaptations artemia salina eggs 50 mg supplied by maramarpet rio de janeiro brazil were incubated in a glass container filled with 1 l of artificial saline water in the presence of light for a period of 48 h the artificial saline solution was prepared with natural mineral water supplied by pura goias brazil and 0 035 w v of cooking salt supplied by dunas rio grande do norte brazil the ph of the solution was adjusted to 8 with the addition of 0 1 mol l naoh after hatching ten crustaceans were transferred using a pipette to a test tube with artificial saline water then samples were added into a tube whose preparation consisted of dilution in ultrapure water to make up concentrations of 0 25 50 75 and 100 v v for a total volume of 10 ml to make it clear raw and treated effluent was investigated both in five concentration levels where 100 v v corresponds to the sample without dilution assays were performed in triplicate and monitored by a negative control ultrapure water crustaceans were counted after 24 h those that were sedimented and without movement were considered dead toxicity was expressed as the mean lethal concentration necessary to kill 50 of a population of crustaceans tested lc50 for that reason mortality data were analyzed statistically via probit usepa 2002 in addition a pearson chi square test was performed to assess meaningful differences from the control test all analyzes were performed in r software version 4 1 2 using the function code described by pacheco et al 2013 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated wastewater 3 1 1 effect of multivariate conditions of process on the total organic carbon removal and gas production the efficiency of the treatment process was evaluated with the goal of optimizing temperature t feed flow rate f and concentration of h2o2 c conditions to maximize organic matter degradation for this reason the rate of total organic carbon removal rtoc was the parameter considered for evaluating the process efficiency as this covers amoxicillin degradation damox which has also been evaluated which were defined using eqs 1 and 2 1 r t o c 1 t o c o u t t o c i n x 100 2 d a m o x 1 d o u t d i n x 100 where t o c i n and t o c o u t are the total organic concentrations of wastewater samples at the inlet and outlet of the reaction system respectively to refer to amoxicillin concentrations in inlet and outlet d i n and d o u t were termed to understand the effect of multivariate conditions on the treatment process 18 tests designed by composite central design were performed using pharmaceutical industry simulated wastewater the results achieved are shown in table 1 based on the experimental data presented the reduced quadratic polynomial regression model that predicts the rtoc as a function of the independent variables decoded is given in eq 3 regression coefficients of linear temperature t and quadratic temperature t2 were significant p 0 10 along with feed flow rate f and h2o2 concentration c also a slight linear interaction between feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration was noted fc the coefficients values of the mathematical model that reflect experimental results are displayed in table s1 in the supplementary material the p value of model was satisfactorily meaningful p 3 931 10 6 with multiple r squared of 0 9182 3 r toc 66 426 0 157 t 1 513 f 0 065 c 0 012 fc 0 0002 t 2 anova results for rtoc show a p value of the lack of fit of 0 0012 that replies to the reliability of the model and combined with the r2 value indicates that 91 82 of the data variability for this reaction unity and within the range of the parameters assessed can be expressed by the model this enhances the model is reasonably adequate since the process involves complex and diverse reactions as shown in table 2 furthermore statistical analysis revealed random and independent residuals with a normal distribution in other words a mean of zero and constant variance the histogram of distribution can be seen in fig s1 the response surface method was used to grasp the effects of process experimental conditions using eq 3 the behavior of toc removal in the function of three multivariable was assessed considering the third variable at the central level consequently three situations were deemed as shown in fig 2 in the first situation the response surface for the rtoc was considered with concentration at the central level as shown in fig 2a the temperature was the variable with the most significant effect on the response its increase enhanced the treatment while the feed flow rate increase led to a decrease in rtoc as expected higher feed flow rates lead to decreased reactor residence time thus the rtoc reduces together with reaction time in the second situation analyzing the response surface for the rtoc assuming the feed flow rate at the central level fig 2b it can be observed that the oxidation of organic matter was favored by the increase in temperature and concentration of h2o2 the use of h2o2 as an oxidation inducer demonstrated an increase of approximately 24 in the treatment efficiency in the third situation the response surface for the rtoc is analyzed considering the temperature at the central level fig 2c the oxidation of organic matter was favored when operating conditions of lower feed flow rate and higher h2o2 concentration were used it was also possible to reach the same rtoc using low flow rate and low h2o2 concentration that is to say that the increase in residence time associated with low h2o2 content also favored oxidation degradation therefore it is noted that the presence of oxidizing agent was not the most significant effect which may be a direct result of the short range of h2o2 concentration evaluated at the last the temperature was the variable with the most significant effect on the oxidation of organic matter followed by the feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration the effect of multivariate conditions of process in the gas production also was observed considering that the removal of organic matter in the liquid phase is directly associated with gasification table 3 shows the results of molar fraction and volumetric flow for the gaseous products the highest molar fractions were determined for hydrogen followed by carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide ethane ethylene and methane had very low and even negligible molar fractions the highest volumetric flows were determined for tests 4 8 12 and 14 where temperatures of 625 625 683 and 485 c respectively for these same tests h2o2 concentrations of 13 9 80 7 47 3 and 47 3 respectively these results reveal that the increase in temperature combined with the presence of h2o2 favored the oxidation process due to the action of hydroxyl radicals and consequently the gasification of organic matter the smallest volumetric flows were determined for tests 1 5 and 13 where temperatures of 345 345 and 485 c were used respectively the low temperatures associated with low feed flow rates justify the low gas produced the production of gasses involves a complex process which occurs through a sequence of physical transformations and chemical reactions inside the reactor the organic matter suffers oxidation due to the presence of radical species in the reaction medium then the remaining organic material reacts with co2 and steam to produce co and h2 hantoko et al 2018 wei et al 2021 the overall simplified gasification reaction is given in the chemical equation below 4 chxoy 2 y h2o co2 2 y x 2 h2 before that simultaneous reactions can take place in the gaseous phase including water gas shift eq 5 steam reforming eq 6 and dry reforming by co2 eq 7 which can have favored h2 production the predominance of a specific reaction can depend on the process conditions such as temperature pressure mean residence time reagent availability and catalyst characteristic if applicable 5 co h2o co2 h2 6 ch4 h2o 2co 3h2 7 ch4 co2 co 3h2 hydrogen selectivity was predominant in all tests in test 1 both the selectivity for h2 and co2 were approximately equal due to the low temperature and low flow rate 8 n ml min in test 5 carried out at a temperature of 287 c and a feed rate of 15 n ml min the selectivity for co was greater than for co2 in contrast to the other tests this fact is due to the increase in feed flow rate which decreases the residence time furthermore the reverse water gas displacement reaction may have been favored in subcritical condition susanti et al 2014 tests 15 and 16 were performed at the same temperature and feed flow rate 485 c and 15 ml min respectively in these tests the minimum 0 and maximum 94 5 h2o2 concentrations were investigated the results showed that the concentration of h2o2 had no significant effect on the volumetric flow of the gaseous products on the other hand it was observed that this independent variable impacts the selectivity of the gasses produced the presence of h2o2 caused a reduction of h2 production and an increase in the production of co2 this is due to the action of the hydroxyl radicals of the oxidant which tend to complete oxidation degradation of organic matter leading to the formation of only carbon dioxide and water he et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 3 1 2 optimization of total organic carbon removal the treatment process using scwg was optimized to determine the best conditions of temperature feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration to reach the maximum of rtoc for this reason the reduced quadratic model eq 3 which predicts the rtoc was applied to the code of the search algorithm for differential evolution developed by vieira et al 2011 the results of the optimization study found the following optimal operating conditions temperature 682 c flow rate 5 1 ml min and h2o2 9 2 w w the rtoc calculated was 65 02 the confirmatory experiment carried out at the optimum condition achieved a rtoc of 60 1 which means a relative error of approximately 8 between calculated and predicted responses thus the model proved to be adequate in describing the behavior of multivariable parameters in the degradation of organic matter related to amoxicillin moreover within acceptable error since this process involves numerous chemical reactions of high complexity the results corroborate with the profile shown by the response surface graphs where it was evidenced that carbon oxidation is favored by high temperatures low feed flow rates and low h2o2 concentrations with a significance level exactly in that order that said the validation of this model is reiterated considering the evaluated limits 3 1 3 degradation of antibiotic amoxicillin regarding amoxicillin degradation the industry wastewater simulated treated by scwg was analyzed by hplc uv calibration curve and typical chromatogram of analysis are displayed in fig s2 results are shown in table 1 as can be seen damox for all tests were higher than 90 that suggest potentiality of the treatment process to degrade amoxicillin moreover enhancing the evidence of antibiotic degradation high resolution mass spectrometry analyzes were performed fig 3 shows the spectra of untreated and treated samples the results show a complex spectrum with numerous fragments in the untreated sample the low intensity signal with a m z ratio of 388 09 was assign to amoxicillin c16h19o5n3nas in the form of sodium adduct m na as can be seen in fig 3a the presence of the ion c15 13ch20o5n3s at m z of 367 11 in the spectrum which corresponds to the natural proportion of 13c in the amoxicillin molecule was decisive to confirm the determination of amoxicillin in the untreated samples after scwg treatment a significant reduction in the fragmentation profile was observed and amoxicillin was not detected fig 3b the lowest and highest damox was observed in entries 3 and 12 table 1 respectively run 3 reaction was performed with an h2o2 concentration 13 9 a feed flow rate of 22 ml min and a temperature of 345 c run 12 reaction was performed with an h2o2 concentration of 47 3 a temperature of 683 c and a feed flow rate of 15 0 ml min this indicates that temperature is the most influential parameter for the oxidation and or degradation of amoxicillin thus considering the best result of degradation run 12 and that the inlet solution concentration was 1000 mg l of amoxicillin it was observed that for an amoxicillin mass flow rate of 15 mg min fed into the reaction system 14 4 mg min of antibiotic was degraded dogan and kidak 2016 investigated the oxidation of amoxicillin based on uv and uv h2o2 radiation into a plug flow reactor with a volume of 680 cm3 the higher damox was obtained using uv h2o2 a solution with an amoxicillin concentration of 25 mg l reached damox of 92 corresponds to 23 mg degradation per l and rtoc of 55 after 67 min of treatment thus amoxicillin was processed at approximately 0 23 mg min the treatment of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin using scwg in a continuous flow reactor l 2 m v 4 6 ml was shown by stavbar et al 2017 the concentration for both antibiotics was 80 μg l results showed that the best treatment conditions occurred at a temperature of 500 c and a flow rate of 5 ml min under these conditions the concentrations of amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin decreased to 21 and 28 ng l respectively thus an approximate rate of processing degradation for both antibiotics was 79 9 μg min despite demonstrating efficiency in the treatment of antibiotics especially for amoxicillin both the process using photodegradation and scwg showed a relatively low degradation rate compared to the processing performance presented by this study which was 14 4 mg min dogan and kidak 2016 stavbar et al 2017 3 2 industry pharmaceutical wastewater 3 2 1 treatment of wastewater and chemical characterization the wastewater from the pharmaceutical industry was treated via scwg at the optimized operational conditions of temperature feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration 682 c 5 1 ml min and 9 2 w w respectively results of sample characterization before and after treatment were compared with environmental agency s regulations that play a role in wastewater and water quality of treatment such as companhia de desenvolvimento econômico de goiás codego 2016 conselho nacional do meio ambiente conama 2011 european environment agency eea 2018 and united states environmental agency usepa 2020 comparison details can be found in table s2 in short after treatment toc concentrations decreased from 543 0 to 116 6 mg l which means a rtoc of 78 4 national legislation conama and codego does not establish any parameter related to the toc content on the other hand the eea indicates that no less than 95 of removal must occur for the effluent to be disposed of in a collection network in this regard the treatment was not sufficient to comply with this regulation it is worth mentioning in this case that an adjustment of the residence time either by reducing the feed flow rate or by increasing the dimensions of the reactor will possibly lead to compliance with the regulations and complete organic matter degradation nonetheless such alternatives have not been tested due to technical operational limitations the results showed a significant reduction in cod after treatment the cod concentration decreased from 7300 to 719 mg l representing a 90 reduction this value agrees with codego s regional legislation as expected nitrate nitrite and sulfate concentrations had significant decay after treatment this can be explained due to the low solubility of inorganic compounds in a medium containing water in a supercritical condition and consequently favoring the precipitation of salts and oxides he et al 2014 in summary metals analysis revealed low concentrations for the treated effluent with reservations regarding molybdenum nickel and titanium concentrations which had a significant increase although that their concentrations agree with the parameters established by the legislation this concentration increase is due to the wear of the reaction system used in the treatment process given that boron molybdenum and nickel make up the metal alloy used in the manufacture of the reactor stainless steel vcr 625 the increase in selenium and boron concentrations is also related to the mechanical wear suffered by other parts of the reaction system in this case 316 stainless steels it is common for these metals to be used in the composition of 316 stainless steel to improve machinability and strength xu and guo 2022 samples of untreated and treated industrial effluent were analyzed by direct injection in a high resolution mass spectrometer the results revealed the presence of the antibiotics amoxicillin and ciprofloxacin in raw effluent which correspond to the signals detected at m z of 366 11 and 332 14 respectively as can be seen in fig 4 after treatment via scwg it was observed reduction in the number of detected peaks showing a cleaner spectrum furthermore the peaks that remained after the treatment process had a significant reduction in intensity such as the signals at m z 333 23 317 24 and 301 40 which indicate the degradation of organic molecules corroborating the results of toc removal on the other hand the signal intensity at m z 241 06 increased in the treated effluent possibly due to the break of antibiotic molecules into a common fragment however this signal could not be accurately correlated to any molecular formula assigned by the xcalibur software the fragments that had the highest intensity and attribution of m z ratios with a deviation less than 3 ppm from the measured mass in relation to the theoretical mass had their molecular formula shown in table s3 given the complexity of the samples the interpretation of the spectra by means of deduction considering the fragmentation route is not feasible 3 2 2 evaluation of toxic activity in the brine shrimp artemia salina toxicity bioassays investigate the effects of a chemical on a living organism in this study the effluent contaminated with antibiotics from the pharmaceutical industry was evaluated against the microcrustacean artemia salina various toxicity tests with brine shrimp are commonly used including methods to assess short and long term effects libralato et al 2016 the use of brine shrimp in toxicity tests has been frequently applied in the evaluation of various chemical substances there are reports of this type of bioassay used successfully in the study of antibiotics nanomaterials plant extracts drugs effluents oils pesticides phenolic compounds and phthalates pecoraro et al 2021 reddy and osborne 2020 thiagarajan et al 2022 thus considering these reports brine shrimp were used to evaluate the toxicity of industrial effluent treated by scwg the results are shown in table 4 the experimental data allowed the calculation of lc50 for brine shrimp exposed to effluent for 24 h the results revealed high lethality for brine shrimp these microcrustaceans had 50 of the dead population lc50 when exposed to a concentration of 4 2 v v of antibiotic wastewater as shown in table 4 this result was calculated with 95 confidence intervals 15 degrees of freedom the goodness of fit was a chi square χ2 of 62 31 and a p value of 2 41 10 28 after treatment the lc50 increased from 4 2 to 12 3 which means an increase of 293 in the lethal concentration thus there was a reduction in toxicity in other words lc50 is inversely proportional to toxicity a substance with a lower lc50 is more toxic than one with a higher lc50 the lc50 of the treated effluent was calculated with confidence intervals of 95 and upper and lower limits of 3 41 and 20 95 respectively the goodness of fit was calculated with 15 degrees of freedom the χ2 value was 64 08 and the p value was 8 59 10 17 despite being treated the effluent is still highly toxic to brine shrimp this toxicity may be related to the amoxicillin degradation by products since the maximum of rtoc was 78 4 the absence of amoxicillin in the mass spectrometry results for treated samples further supports this possibility it is crucial to reiterate that introducing an excess of oxidizing agent reducing the feed flow rate or enlarging the reactor dimensions may result in the complete removal of total organic carbon and consequently lead to a notable reduction in toxicity levels thiagarajan et al 2022 evaluated the toxicity of tio2 nanoparticles associated with the antibiotic tetracycline against artemia salina this combination has been evaluated due to the increasing use of nanomaterials and pharmaceuticals that are uninterruptedly released into the marine ecosystem and represent a serious concern the reported results indicated that the presence of tetracycline additively increased the toxic effects of nanoparticles on brine shrimp alone tetracycline intermediates accounted for 28 7 3 5 of microcrustacean mortality thiagarajan et al 2022 although this parallel is made by comparing only the antibiotic tetracycline to other antibiotics and pollutants present in industrial effluent it can be inferred that antibiotics have an impact on toxicity consequently this factor can increase mortality rates 3 2 3 analysis of the gaseous product the composition of the gaseous product generated during the industrial effluent treatment process was evaluated and the results are shown in fig 5 the effluent was treated under the optimal conditions of temperature feed flow rate and concentration of h2o2 682 c 5 1 ml min and 9 2 w w respectively under such treatment conditions the gasses carbon dioxide ethane ethylene hydrogen methane and carbon monoxide were determined without the presence of any other unidentified peak in the chromatograms hydrogen was the major constituent and represented 37 68 of the molar fraction of the gasses produced the composition of c1 type compounds was superior to that of c2 type compounds this indicates that although total mineralization of organic compounds and complete gasification have not occurred this treatment process demonstrates a great capacity for oxidation in the conversion of complex molecules into simpler molecules furthermore the total volumetric flow of gasses was approximately 6 45 n ml min a reasonable value since the feed flow was only 5 1 ml min and both the cod and toc values in the industrial effluent samples indicate a low number of organic compounds susceptible to gasification in this study although it was not possible to provide a mass balance for the process due to the analytical complexity quali and quantitative determination a carbon balance to verify the process data accuracy was performed considering the optimal treatment condition for this purpose the carbon amount of the inlet liquid phase and outlet both liquid and gaseous phase of the process were considered as shown in table 5 results show a slight increase in the mass after the process which is inconsistent with the principles of mass conservation such a discrepancy could be a sign of process fluctuation wherein measurements were taken during a system pulse and carbon inside the reactor was released in any case the carbon balance error 2 was deemed acceptable and it might also reflect the experimental measurement errors the molar ratios of h2 co2 and h2 co were approximately 2 and 2 9 respectively according to the national energy technology laboratory netl under the united states department of energy in such proportions of composition this gas can be used as synthesis gas to produce methanol hydrogen and combustible gasses netl 2022 thus it appears that this technology applied to the treatment of this effluent showed efficiency to gasify the organic matter while synthesis gas was produced 4 conclusion the use of scwg technology under optimized conditions for the response rtoc 682 c 5 1 ml min and 9 2 w w for temperature feed flow rate and h2o2 concentration respectively it was efficient for amoxicillin degradation despite the rtoc achieved being only 60 1 the damox varied between 90 85 and 99 99 in the 18 experimental tests performed in a sample of effluent from the pharmaceutical industry after scwg treatment the rtoc was 78 4 in addition most of the criteria that attest to the quality of water are following the established by regulatory agencies however toxicity tests against artemia salina revealed high toxicity for these microcrustaceans among the gaseous products hydrogen gas was the major component and represented 37 68 of the total molar fraction the total volumetric flow of gasses was approximately 6 45 n ml min thus the supercritical water oxidation technology proved to be efficient for the degradation of the antibiotic amoxicillin with potential for the treatment of pharmaceutical effluent in addition the amount of amoxicillin processed per minute 14 4 mg min is an advantage that deserves to be highlighted when compared to other treatment techniques therefore the results revealed that the application of scwg is a promising technology in the treatment of industrial effluents and their emerging pollutants supplementary data the supplementary material is available free of charge on elsevier equipment details and methods

14936,the yangtze river the largest river in asia plays a crucial role in linking continental and oceanic ecosystems however the impact of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on composition and transformation of dissolved organic matter dom during long distance transport and seasonal cycle is not fully understood by using a combination of elemental isotopic and optical techniques as well as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms we investigated dom abundance and composition along the whole mainstream at highly spatial resolution in the dry and early wet seasons our findings showed that the concentration and flux of dissolved organic carbon doc in the yangtze river was much lower compared with other worldwide larger rivers the distribution of δ 13cdoc and higher abundance of humic like fluorescent component and highly unsaturated and phenolics hups compound reflected a prominent contribution of allochthonous dom further optical and molecular analysis revealed humic like fluorescent components were coupled with cho molecules and hups compound with higher aromatic unsaturated molecular weight and stable characteristics between upstream and midstream reaches with increasing agricultural and urban land downstream there were more heteroatomic formulae and labile aliphatic and protein like compounds which were derived from human activities and in situ primary production meanwhile dom gradually accumulates with slow water flow and additional autochthonous organics weaker solar radiation and water dilution during the dry cold season favours highly aromatic unsaturated and oxygenated dom compositions conversely higher discharge during the wet warm season diluted the terrestrial dom but warm temperatures could promote phytoplankton growth that releases labile aliphatic and protein like dom besides chemical sulfurization hydrogenation and oxygenation were found during molecular cycling processes our research emphasizes the active response of riverine dom to natural and anthropogenic controls and provides a valuable preliminary background to better understand the biogeochemical cycling of dom in a larger river graphical abstract highlighted characteristics and compositions of riverine dom pool of three reaches and two seasons image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter optical properties molecular composition driving factors yangtze river data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction as major land ocean ecosystem connectors inland waters are key sites for transport transformation and burial of carbon and nutrients kattner et al 1999 zhou et al 2021 dissolved organic matter dom comprises the largest pool of active and exchangeable organic carbon on earth and plays a profound role in carbon cycling hansell and carlson 2014 most organic carbon in aquatic environments is in the dissolved form and the global dissolved organic carbon doc flux from worldwide rivers into the ocean is estimated at approximately 0 25 pg c yr 1 hedges et al 1997 raymond and spencer 2015 riverine doc fluxes are usually higher in large rivers with larger discharge greenhouse gas emissions biological activity and ecological stability of fluvial systems are closely related to the elemental optical and molecular characteristics of dom medeiros et al 2015 remington et al 2011 therefore the spatial and temporal variability of the quantity and quality of dom in large rivers has become a research hotspot in recent years bianchi et al 2004 spencer et al 2009 zhao et al 2021a riverine dom is derived from multiple sources including allochthonous dom from soil and plant litters along tributaries and main river channels autochthonous dom from in situ primary production and anthropogenic dom from agricultural runoff urban wastewater and fossil fuel combustion begum et al 2022 cleveland et al 2004 gonsior et al 2011 spencer et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the construction of dams and land use changes may also indirectly regulate source distributions for riverine dom du et al 2021 kraus et al 2011 for instance agriculture can stimulate phytoplankton biomass growth and reduce dissolved oxygen concentration by increasing nutrient loadings which leads to a higher proportion of autochthonous dom in receiving waters chen et al 2021 due to inherent absorbance and fluorescence properties ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy eem combined with parallel factor analysis parafac have been widely used to track dom sources and components helms et al 2008 li et al 2020 osburn et al 2016 however traditional optical techniques have unavoidable limitations to explain the behavior of non chromophoric and specific compounds within the dom pool in recent years fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been revealed as a powerful tool for identifying dom compositions at the molecular level by detecting and assigning unique molecular formulae to thousands of mass spectra peaks behnke et al 2021 kellerman et al 2015 spencer et al 2014 ft icr ms is also useful to trace photo bio degradation and other chemical reactions e g methylation sulfurization hydrogenation and oxidation during dom cycling processes berg et al 2019 miranda et al 2020 schmitt kopplin et al 2010 furthermore changes in stable carbon isotopic ratios δ 13c are induced by photosynthesis diagenetic and metabolic fractionation thus δ 13c is a useful tool for tracking sources and biogeochemical transformation of organic carbon andrews et al 1998 nkoue ndondo et al 2021 wu et al 2007 δ 13c values for terrestrial c3 plant 30 to 20 are significantly lower than for plankton in eutrophic lakes and seawater 22 to 19 but are more positive than for plankton in freshwater 32 to 26 derrien et al 2018 lamb et al 2006 zhao et al 2021b additionally the development of the mixsiar model in r software based on a bayesian framework allows quantification of the contribution of these diverse sources of organic matter in inland aquatic ecosystems meng et al 2021 stock et al 2018 the yangtze river china is the largest river in asia and links mainland china with the east china sea the largest marginal sea in the north western pacific previous studies estimated doc transport and air water co2 fluxes in the yangtze river and found they were mainly controlled by temperature river discharge and precipitation liu et al 2015 zhai et al 2007 recently the removal of riverine doc via photo and microbial degradation and flocculation mechanisms has also been reported figueroa et al 2021 waiser and robarts 2004 however it remains unclear how the dom characteristics at elemental optical and molecular levels change across the land ocean continuum of this large river expected modifications in the ratios of allochthonous v autochthonous sources and stable vs labile compounds commonly caused different dynamics of riverine dom roth et al 2019 spencer et al 2019 moreover previous studies were based on a limited number of sampling sites near the existing hydrological stations or short reaches of the yangtze river bai et al 2015 wang et al 2021 due to various landform types and intense local human activities in the yangtze river basin the amount and quality of dom have been possibly altered dramatically over time therefore it is necessary to conduct more precise investigations along the entire stream with higher spatial and temporal resolution in this study surface water samples were collected from upstream to estuary of the yangtze river total distance 2300 km during two contrasting seasons due to chemical complexity and diversity of dom in a large river we combined a set of analytical methods including hydrological measurements elemental optical absorbance and fluorescence carbon isotope and molecular ft icr ms techniques our objectives were to 1 investigate the abundance sources and compositions of dom at highly spatial resolution in two seasons 2 clarify the transport and transformation of riverine dom at spatial and temporal scales and 3 explore the impacts of natural and anthropogenic forces on dom cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site sample collection and in situ data the yangtze river has a total length of 6300 km and a drainage basin area of 1808 500 km2 from the qinghai tibetan plateau to the east china sea fig 1 based on hydrologic and geographical characteristics we divided the yangtze river into three reaches upstream reach

precipitation of 1054 mm average years 1961 2019 zhou et al 2021 due to asian ocean monsoons and anticyclone anomalies 70 of annual rainwater relatively higher temperature and uv radiation occur

half of the gross national product of china detailed climatic and economic information is provided in fig s1 this study was conducted along the main stream of the yangtze river from upstream near chongqing city to the estuary fig 1 surface water samples were collected with a 10 l niskin bottle pre cleaned by ph 2 hcl acidified water and ultrapure water in december 2020 samples yzd1 to 71 and in may 2021 samples yzm1 to 114 from a research vessel the two sampling periods had significant differences in monthly rainfall air temperature and river discharge wang and wu 2021 the first

quartz cuvette was 1 cm and ultrapure water was used as blank the eem data of dom samples were measured with a fs5 spectrofluorometer edinburgh instruments using ultrapure water as a blank the excitation ex and emission em scans were 200 450 nm interval 5 nm and 250 600 nm interval 1 nm respectively details on correction procedures for eem results are shown in supporting information 1 1 and

analysis and comparison with the openflour database murphy et al 2014 five fluorescence components were identified including three humic like components c1 c3 and two protein like components c4 c5 fig s5 and table s2 the relative abundance of each component was calculated by dividing the fluorescent intensity f max of each component by total the fluorescent intensity f max of ct 2 3 stable carbon isotopic analysis the wet oxidation method combining persulfate and heat has been previously employed for measuring the δ 13c of doc δ 13cdoc lang et al 2012 zhou et al 2015 the isotopic carbon composition of the co2 resulting from organic matter oxidation was determined with a mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific bremen germany coupled with a gasbench on line high precision gas headspace sampler thermo fisher scientific details can be found in the supporting information 1 2 we selected usgs 40 l glutamic acid nist whose true δ 13c value is 26 39 0 09 as organic carbon standard each sample and standard were measured five times and the standard deviation of δ 13cdoc was less than 0 4 finally all measurements were calibrated based on modified single point anchoring normalization to remove the influence of the isotopic composition of the blank paul et al 2007 2 4 pre treatment measurement and data analysis of ft icr ms a total of 37 dom samples 11 samples from the dry season and 26 samples from the wet season were prepared for ft icr ms analysis by solid phase extraction spe with bond elut ppl cartridges 6 ml 500 mg agilent as previously described dittmar et al 2008 details can be found in the supporting information 1 3 molecular analysis of extracted dom was performed on a 21 tesla ft icr ms with negative electrospray ionization located at the national high magnetic field laboratory in tallahassee florida usa smith et al 2018 the broadband mass spectrum was collected from 100 averaged time domain transients molecular formulae were assigned from mass spectral peaks with signals 6σ baseline root mean square noise behnke et al 2021 spencer et al 2019 using the petroorg software corilo 2015 elemental combinations of c1 45h1

anova and kruskal wallis test were performed to assess the significance of dom differences among seasons and river reaches in spss 19 0 software significance was reported as p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 spearman correlation analysis was conducted in r 4 2 0 with the hmisc package principal component analysis pca was used to further examine dom variability in r 4 2 0 with the factoextra package and all variables were scaled to unit variance before pca 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations fluxes and sources of doc in the yangtze river the doc concentration along the yangtze river ranged from 1 30 mg c l 1 to 3 20 mg c l 1 average standard deviation 1 83 0 40 mg c l 1 in the dry season and 1 15 mg c l 1 to 3 43 mg c l 1 1 68 0 26 mg c l 1 in the wet season fig s3a b the doc concentration was not significantly different between the two seasons implying that the impoundment of the three gorges dam during the dry season did not lead to more doc decomposition though it could increase time residence of river water according to daily field records at hydrometric stations the doc flux was estimated to be approximately 0 038 0 094 tg c for the dry season month and 0 063 0 19 tg c for the early wet season month respectively higher doc flux during the wet season supports previous studies showing that discharge could control doc dynamics in lakes or rivers bao et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the doc flux in this study is much lower than other large rivers such as the mississippi amazon and congo rivers which is attributed to comparatively low doc concentration in the yangtze river liu et al 2015 the average doc value was highest downstream 1 94 0 37 mg c l 1 followed by upstream 1 60 0 19 mg c l 1 and midstream 1 60 0 23 mg c l 1 fig s6a the significant increase of doc from upstream reach to estuary reflected carbon accumulation with water flow although the dense population and rapid urbanization downstream likely increased doc inputs to the river fig s1a b the added doc was relatively low 4 mg c l 1 due to green development performed in china since 2016 zhou et al 2021 moreover the significantly positive relationship between doc concentration and water turbidity indicated that particulate organic carbon poc could be a source of doc which makes river browner impacting light penetration depth into water p 0 001 fig s3d δ 13cdoc varied between 26 90 and 21 06 with an average value of 25 24 1 13 in the dry season and between 27 69 and 22 12 with an average of 25 05 1 16 in the wet season fig 2 a there was no significant difference in δ 13cdoc values between the two seasons p 0 05 δ 13cdoc slightly increased with distance from the estuary which was higher upstream 24 34 1 20 than midstream 25 04 1 01 and downstream 25 76 0 79 based on the δ 13cdoc values the samples from different seasons and river reaches might have the same sources and or the intense mixing of river water made the δ 13cdoc signature to be more homogeneous along the yangtze river here we found that riverine doc was mainly originated from allochthonous and autochthonous organics the δ 13c distribution of allochthonous organics included terrestrial soil and plants litters around the watershed range 28 9 23 1 average 26 2 1 9 fig 2b are close to our samples δ 13cdoc values sun et al 2021 wu et al 2007 but the δ 13c values of autochthonous sources were more negative range 33 3 28 1 average 30 8 1 7 fig 2b because hydrophyte preferentially utilized dissolved 12c rich co2 δ 13c 7 during photosynthesis marty and planas 2008 since marine algae preferred bicarbonate δ 13c 0 as carbon sources instead of dissolved co2 their δ 13c increased to a relatively high average value 20 9 1 9 lamb et al 2006 the higher δ 13c value of autochthonous sources was also found in some eutrophic inland lakes e g taihu lake and dianchi lake because dissolved co2 was depleted to near zero value li et al 2022 meng et al 2021 but the phenonmenon was rare in the yangtze river therefore we suggested that allochthonous organic matter played a prominent contribution for the riverine dom pool which is consistent with some previous study results wen et al 2021 wu et al 2007 conversely autochthonous carbon sources did not contribute significantly due to high flow turbidity water depth and rocky bottom in situ phytoplankton and submerged plants growth in the yangtze river is limited wang et al 2014 some overlaps among the δ 13c ranges of allochthonous and autochthonous end members likely affect the accuracy of estimated results by bayesian mixing model therefore we should combine other techniques to provide more evidence for the diverse origins of riverine dom as will be discussed in next sections 3 2 variations in optical properties of riverine dom optical properties of dom showed obvious spatial difference along the yangtze river fig 3 4 and fig s6 a254 gradually increased downstream varying between 4 94 m 1 and 12 90 m 1 fig 3a suva254 had a significantly higher value downstream 2 38 0 33 l mg 1 m 1 than midstream 2 04 0 24 l mg 1 m 1 and upstream 1 96 0 38 l mg 1 m 1 p 0 001 fig s6c the average s 275 295 value was closed among downstream 0 016 0 002 midstream 0 016 0 003 and upstream 0 016 0 003 fig 4b and the difference didn t show statistical significance p 0 05 fig s6d these suggested that chromophoric dom cdom was constantly resupplied by surface runoff between midstream and downstream reaches the highest abundance of terrestrial t humic like components c2 and c3 range 0 22 2 35 r u and the low fi value range 1 22 1 76 indicated that the yangtze river was mainly associated with imported terrestrial humus leached from soils and litters from the notably higher f max value of t humic like components midstream 0 68 0 53 r u p 0 05 fig s6g we inferred that the additional terrestrial fluorescent dom fdom was transported by the han river which is the longest tributary of the yangtze river meanwhile hix was obviously higher midstream 6 99 3 30 than upstream 3 82 1 17 and downstream 3 47 1 58 p 0 001 fig s6l but fi decreased midstream 1 40 0 07 fig 4c increased amounts of t humic like components elevated the humification degree and terrestrial signal of dom the f max of the microbial m humic like component c1 and two protein like components c4 and c5 gradually increased downstream fig 3c and e f reflecting enhanced microbial metabolism and primary production which were closely related to densely agricultural and urban activities downstream chen et al 2021 tang et al 2020 the significantly higher bix downstream 1 06 0 39 p 0 01 fig s6k also pointed to a greater contribution of freshly autochthonous inputs however the autochthonous production was still lower throughout the whole river based on average bix 1 and a ratio of t humic like component to protein like component 1 consequently terrestrial organic matter possibly became the dominant organic carbon source to for the aquatic food web the c3 c4 grasses and invertebrates derived nutrients on land could be continuously assimilated by primary consumers contributing to consumers at higher trophic levels allan et al 2003 leite et al 2002 furthermore the characteristics of both cdom and fdom significantly changed from dry to wet seasons fig 3 4 a254 and f max of ct m humic like c1 and t humic like components c2 and c3 significantly increased by 0 97 m 1 0 11 r u and 0 30 r u on average in the dry season compared with those in the wet season p 0 01 despite terrestrial inputs would increase into yangtze river via high runoff during wet season pang et al 2021 increased river discharge eventually diluted cdom and humic like fdom concentrations fig s1c on the other hand enhanced solar uv radiation in summer promoted the penetration of light in water and rapidly decomposed photo reactive substances for example cdom and terrestrial humic like fdom in contrast the f max of tryptophan like c4 and bix had significantly higher values in the wet season p 0 01 phytoplankton growth and intense microbial activities would promote in situ primary production under warm temperature in the wet season fig s1d which released freshly protein like fractions s 275 295 and fi significantly decreased by 0 002 and 0 04 on average from wet season to dry season p 0 001 and hix significantly increased by 1 84 on average from wet season to dry season p 0 001 the seasonal cycle and hydrologic change left relatively more cdom and humic like fdom and meanwhile reduced protein like fdom in the dry season which increased the humification degree and terrestrial signal of riverine dom overall the total content of optical substance tended to accumulate downstream or in dry season but natural and anthropogenic factors directly or indirectly impacted the complexity of optical structures and components 3 3 general molecular signatures by ft icr ms the number of molecular formulae detected via ft icr ms analysis was in the range of 11 468 to 16 750 depending on the 37 samples the total number of formulae was 27 590 and the formulae pool would be gradually more saturated with increasing samples suggesting these riverine samples were highly representative the number of molecular formulae in the yangtze river is higher than in greenland glacier streams and a pacific temperate lake and similar to the mississippi river johnston et al 2022 kellerman et al 2021 vaughn et al 2021 larger rivers crossing complex watersheds generally show a higher number of dom formulae the majority of molecular mass covered the range of 200 1000 da fig s7a and showed a normal distribution centered at 630 30 da median value a total of 6895 common formulae was ubiquitous among all samples and usually appeared in the core of the van krevelen v k plot o c 0 50 0 12 h c 1 14 0 22 fig s7b the calculation of the relative abundance of elemental compositions fig s8 indicated that cho molecules 64 14 2 74 ra dominated followed by chon 24 18 2 21 ra chos 10 69 2 29 ra and chons molecules 0 99 0 34 ra based on o c h c and aimod molecular formulae were further divided into relatively stable compound groups i

o c followed by aliphatic 5 39 1 54 ra and polyphenolics compound 5 00 0 79 ra fig s8 the other compounds represented less than 1 ra hups compounds were mainly derived from lignin metabolism and polyphenolics compounds were derived from terrestrial vascular plants but aliphatic compounds were usually produced by the fatty acids of phytoplankton behnke et al 2021 these further supported our isotopic and optical results on the overwhelming contribution of allochthonous dom throughout the yangtze river medeiros et al 2016 identified a set of 184 specific formulae referred as t peaks as plausibly indicative of the presence of terrigenous dom based on ft icr ms data from four rivers from different regions around the world including the arctic kolyma river subtropical altamaha river and equatorial amazon and congo rivers regions these t peaks were also found along the yangtze river n 142 177 and 139 t peaks were continuously observed from upstream to downstream reaches in both seasons table s3 worldwide large rivers have been confirmed to be important pools of terrigenous carbon on earth and could export the part that escaped from photo bio degradation and flocculation to coastal region and even the deep ocean the different proportions of compounds with different elemental compositions could control the inherent structural characteristics e g reactivity and persistence to compare them we calculated weight averaged wa values of all ft icr ms parameters based on their initial values divided by the relative intensity of each peak table s4 the masswa ranged from 518 55 to 567 10 da with an average value of 540 95 11 03 da aimod wa ranged from 0 25 to 0 29 and the average value was almost 2 7 fold higher than that of algal extracts aimod 0 11 lee et al 2019 dbewa varied between 11 07 and 12 54 with an average value of 11 67 0 42 these reflected that the abundant terrestrial materials e g hups and polyphenolic compounds raised the overall molecular weight aromaticity and unsaturated degree of dom in the yangtze river the average noscwa value of 0 12 0 03 was more positive than that of protein like substance 0 7 but fit with the nosc range of lignin like substance 0 2 to 0 1 indicating a reduced state of carbon zhou et al 2019 o cwa and h cwa ranged from 0 47 to 0 51 and 1 14 1 22 and had an average value of 0 50 0 01 and 1 18 0 02 respectively the relatively higher o c ratio and lower h c ratio indicated that our dom samples were less active due to a lower contribution of freshly autochthonous organic matter e g aliphatic and peptide like compounds 3 4 highlighted formulae selected from different riverine reaches and seasons the total number of molecular formulae assigned upstream 14 samples midstream 15 samples and downstream 8 samples was 23 531 24 866 and 22 686 respectively to better understand pronounced variations of dom molecules during the stream longitudinal process we screened out the highlighted molecular formulae of three reaches by comparing their average relative abundance of all mass peaks the results showed downstream samples had the highest number of highlighted formulae n 11 650 followed by midstream samples n 9190 and upstream samples n 6750 due to abundant common formulae these highlighted formulae of different reaches piled together in v k plots fig s9 however the average mass of the highlighted formulae midstream 713 03 da was higher than that upstream 621 93 da and downstream 581 91 da fig 5 a for molecule compound fractions table s5 the highlighted formulae upstream was mostly consisted of cho molecules 29 91 ra and hups with high o c compound 23 58 ra chos and chon molecules with hups with low o c polyphenolics and aliphatic compounds also had a significant contribution 1 ra molecular formulae were characterised as highly oxidized and aromatic the island of stability ios occupying a narrow range of molecular formulae o c 0 52 0 10 h c 1 17 0 13 mass 360 28 and 497 51 da was considered to be the most stable fraction kellerman et al 2018 ios had a higher abundance among the highlighted formulae upstream and was positively correlated with hups with high o c compound fig 6 and s10 suggesting that they are recalcitrant compounds with abundant carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules mainly originated upstream and could be long distance transported by river and finally stored in east china sea in the midstream reach the highlighted formulae were rich in cho molecules 22 22 ra and hups with low o c compound 20 84 ra table s5 resulting in highly unsaturated reduced and higher molecular weight dom meanwhile the relative abundance of chon molecules increased to 4 61 ra but the relative abundance of hups with high o c and polyphenolic compounds decreased greatly the consumption of oxygen rich and aromatic molecules between upstream and midstream reaches might be caused by photodegradation dilution and precipitation with iron minerals kamjunke et al 2019 in the highlighted formulae downstream the relative abundance of heteroatomic molecules markedly increased chon 17 18 ra chos 6 71 ra but cho molecules decreased to 12 01 ra table s5 hups compound still had the highest abundance but the added aliphatic compound 3 92 ra reduced dom unsaturation higher h c and lower dbe fig 6 moreover molecules above the microbial lability boundary mlbl h c 1 5 d andrilli et al 2015 were abundant downstream reflecting that the overall lability of molecules usually increased with more aliphatic and peptide like compounds regarding seasonality the total number of molecular formulae assigned in the dry season 11 samples and wet season 26 samples was 19 751 and 24 074 respectively we also compared average relative abundance of all mass peaks to find the highlighted molecular formulae which could better reflect seasonality samples in the dry season had less numbers of highlighted formulae n 11 694 than samples in the wet season n 15 896 fig s11 the mass distributions major elemental compositions and molecular compositions of highlighted formulae were different among the two seasons fig 5b and table s6 the relative abundance of cho and chon molecules was higher in the dry season and most of them were hups and polyphenolic compounds but chos molecules had a higher relative abundance in the wet season and most of them were hups and aliphatic compounds these compositional changes from dry to wet seasons also influenced the structural characteristics of molecules in the wet season highlighted formulae showed a higher h c ratio and lability by addition of aliphatic or mlbl compounds but that in dry season had relatively higher oxidized aromatic unsaturated and molecular weight characteristics fig 7 we also found that increased discharge during the wet season contributed more ios in the yangtze river fig 7 which was consistent with previous report kurek et al 2022 as a highly degraded refractory product ios was likely independent of its initial properties and sources 3 5 compositional assembly of riverine dom as determined by pca to explore the differences of dom pool in diverse riverine reaches or seasons we conducted five pca using isotopic and optical data in conjunction with abundant molecules ra 1 with highlighted formulae pc2 loading fig 8 a indicated the cho molecules and hups with high o c and polyphenolic compounds which had highest abundance in the highlighted formulae upstream were positively related to m humic like component and δ 13cdoc but were negatively correlated with a254 suva254 tp and tn additionally there was a significantly negative relationship between pc2 scores and distance from the estuary p 0 001 fig 8b we inferred that the dom pool upstream had low cdom content but was enrich in highly oxygenated aromatic and less hydrogenated molecules and microbial fdom components comprehensive ecological restoration in the yangtze river basin has increased the forest coverage upstream to approximately 50 a previous study reported molecular assemblages in forest stream had high o c ratio and aromatic fingerprints due to the dominance of hups and polyphenolic compounds from terrestrial surface soils and litter layers spencer et al 2019 however longitudinally higher flow along the river possibly limited the accumulation of terrestrial organic rich materials leading to lower cdom content upstream the dominant molecules e g cho ra and compounds e g hups with low o c ra midstream were strongly correlated with t humic like component in pc1 negative loading fig 8c and pc1 scores had a significantly negative correlation with hix value p 0 001 fig 8d the inflow of the han river contributed to greater amounts of terrestrial humic rich fractions coupled with low oxidized and high molecular weight hups compounds they were more concentrated midstream than in other two reaches and were considered as typical compositions of the dom pool midstream the major elemental composition and molecules of the highlighted formulae downstream with a254 suva254 protein like component tp and tn appeared in the pc1 positive loading fig 8e pc1 scores also had a significantly negative correlation with the distance from the estuary p 0 001 fig 8f as cropland and urban land increased agricultural practices anthropogenic sewage and associated enhanced primary productivity resulted in more heteroatomic formulae and labile aliphatic and protein like compounds in the dom pool downstream one of the most widely used surfactants for detergents in china is linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las which are composed of o3s compounds and can be degraded into o5s compounds under aerobic condition gong et al 2022 gonsior et al 2011 in this study these o3s and o5s compounds had a significantly positive correlation with chos molecules p 0 001 fig s12 on the other hand reductive sulfurization reaction probably also increased the abundance of chos molecules by exchanging one o atom by one s atom gomez saez et al 2016 moreover cdom content gradually increased downstream due to slow river flow and additional autochthonous organics major molecules and compounds of highlighted formulae in the dry season were strongly correlated with hix and t humic like component in pc1 negative loading fig 9 a b major molecules and compounds of highlighted formulae in the wet season were closely correlated with protein like component no3 n tn and tp in pc1 positive loading fig 9c d during the cold dry seasons the relatively weaker solar radiation and water dilution left more aromatic oxygenated higher unsaturated and molecular weight compounds e g hups and polyphenolics and terrestrial humic like components and meanwhile the autochthonous contribution was very low due to the absence of biological processes a few aliphatic and peptide like compounds derived from the microbial metabolism in soils were possibly transported to the river via surface runoff and groundwater and could be preserved due to cold temperatures in winter behnke et al 2021 during the warm and wet season increased temperature and nutrients inputs from agricultural activities promoted phytoplankton growth and microbial activities that released some freshly autochthonous dom fractions such as aliphatic and protein like compounds these bio available substances could serve as an additional substrate for primary production and microbial communities in the aquatic environment while their degradation would produce some greenhouse gasses emission overall our findings well demonstrated that rapid response of dom pool in a large river to surrounding conditions which play a greater influence on biogeochemical cycling of riverine and even coastal environments 4 conclusion the δ 13cdoc values indicated the dominance of allochthonous over autochthonous dom as confirmed by the high fluorescence intensity of the humic like components identified by eem parafac and the high relative abundance of hups compounds detected by ft icr ms riverine dom displayed significantly spatial and seasonal differences in the forest dominated upstream reach hups with high o c and polyphenolic compounds as well as microbial humic like component were relatively abundant however the accumulation of cdom content was limited due to higher flow these highly oxygenated aromatic and less hydrogenated dom fractions would also be partially degraded during longitudinal transport process the dom pool midstream was mainly consisted of hups with low o c compound and terrestrial humic like component with higher molecular weight unsaturation and humification degree the increasing cropland and urban land uses downstream contributed an amount of heteroatomic molecules and labile compounds to dom pool during dry cold seasons highly unsaturated aromatic and humified dom fractions were preserved due to weaker dilution and photo degradation the abundance of these fractions would decrease with increasing river discharge and solar irradiance during wet and warm season and meanwhile phytoplankton growth under warm temperature released some aliphatic and protein like compounds our findings revealed that riverine dom chemo diversity could be mainly caused by the hydrologic meteorological conditions and anthropogenic activities throughout the whole basin which improved our ability to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics and cycle of dom in a larger river in the future we will extend the study region to the east china sea to investigate biogeochemical cycling of dom in a changing hydrology region and further estimated specific terrestrial carbon injection into the ocean moreover laboratory based incubation experiments should be performed to provide insights on

14936,the yangtze river the largest river in asia plays a crucial role in linking continental and oceanic ecosystems however the impact of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on composition and transformation of dissolved organic matter dom during long distance transport and seasonal cycle is not fully understood by using a combination of elemental isotopic and optical techniques as well as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms we investigated dom abundance and composition along the whole mainstream at highly spatial resolution in the dry and early wet seasons our findings showed that the concentration and flux of dissolved organic carbon doc in the yangtze river was much lower compared with other worldwide larger rivers the distribution of δ 13cdoc and higher abundance of humic like fluorescent component and highly unsaturated and phenolics hups compound reflected a prominent contribution of allochthonous dom further optical and molecular analysis revealed humic like fluorescent components were coupled with cho molecules and hups compound with higher aromatic unsaturated molecular weight and stable characteristics between upstream and midstream reaches with increasing agricultural and urban land downstream there were more heteroatomic formulae and labile aliphatic and protein like compounds which were derived from human activities and in situ primary production meanwhile dom gradually accumulates with slow water flow and additional autochthonous organics weaker solar radiation and water dilution during the dry cold season favours highly aromatic unsaturated and oxygenated dom compositions conversely higher discharge during the wet warm season diluted the terrestrial dom but warm temperatures could promote phytoplankton growth that releases labile aliphatic and protein like dom besides chemical sulfurization hydrogenation and oxygenation were found during molecular cycling processes our research emphasizes the active response of riverine dom to natural and anthropogenic controls and provides a valuable preliminary background to better understand the biogeochemical cycling of dom in a larger river graphical

transport transformation and burial of carbon and nutrients kattner et al 1999 zhou et al 2021 dissolved organic matter dom comprises the largest pool of active and exchangeable organic carbon on earth and plays a profound role in carbon cycling hansell and carlson 2014 most organic carbon in aquatic environments is in the dissolved form and the global dissolved organic carbon doc flux from worldwide rivers into the ocean is estimated at approximately 0 25 pg c yr 1 hedges et al 1997 raymond and spencer 2015 riverine doc fluxes are usually higher in large rivers with larger discharge greenhouse gas emissions biological activity and ecological stability of fluvial systems are closely related to the elemental optical and molecular characteristics of dom medeiros et al 2015 remington et al 2011 therefore the spatial and temporal variability of the quantity and quality of dom in large rivers has become a research hotspot in recent years bianchi et al 2004 spencer et al 2009 zhao et al 2021a riverine dom is derived from multiple sources including allochthonous dom from soil and plant litters along tributaries and main river channels autochthonous dom from in situ primary production and anthropogenic dom from agricultural runoff urban wastewater and fossil fuel combustion begum et al 2022 cleveland et al 2004 gonsior et al 2011 spencer et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 the construction of dams and land use changes may also indirectly regulate source distributions for riverine dom du et al 2021 kraus et al 2011 for instance agriculture can stimulate phytoplankton biomass growth and reduce dissolved oxygen concentration by increasing nutrient loadings which leads to a higher proportion of autochthonous dom in receiving waters chen et al 2021 due to inherent absorbance and fluorescence properties ultraviolet visible spectroscopy uv vis and excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy eem combined with parallel factor analysis parafac have been widely used to track dom sources and components helms et al 2008 li et al 2020 osburn et al 2016 however traditional optical techniques have unavoidable limitations to explain the behavior of non chromophoric and specific compounds within the dom pool in recent years fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms has been revealed as a powerful tool for identifying dom compositions at the molecular level by detecting and assigning unique molecular formulae to thousands of mass spectra peaks behnke et al 2021 kellerman et al 2015 spencer et al 2014 ft icr ms is also useful to trace photo bio degradation and other chemical reactions e g methylation sulfurization hydrogenation and oxidation during dom cycling processes berg et al 2019 miranda et al 2020 schmitt kopplin et al 2010 furthermore changes in stable carbon isotopic ratios δ 13c are induced by photosynthesis diagenetic and metabolic fractionation thus δ 13c is a useful tool for tracking sources and biogeochemical transformation of organic carbon andrews et al 1998 nkoue ndondo et al 2021 wu et al 2007 δ 13c values for terrestrial c3 plant 30 to 20 are significantly lower than for plankton in eutrophic lakes and seawater 22 to 19 but are more positive than for plankton in freshwater 32 to 26 derrien et al 2018 lamb et al 2006 zhao et al 2021b additionally the development of the mixsiar model in r software based on a bayesian framework allows quantification of the contribution of these diverse sources of organic matter in inland aquatic ecosystems meng et al 2021 stock et al 2018 the yangtze river china is the largest river in asia and links mainland china with the east china sea the largest marginal sea in the north western pacific previous studies estimated doc transport and air water co2 fluxes in the yangtze river and found they were mainly controlled by temperature river discharge and precipitation liu et al 2015 zhai et al 2007 recently the removal of riverine doc via photo and microbial degradation and flocculation mechanisms has also been reported figueroa et al 2021 waiser and robarts 2004 however it remains unclear how the dom characteristics at elemental optical and molecular levels change across the land ocean continuum of this large river expected modifications in the ratios of allochthonous v autochthonous sources and stable vs labile compounds commonly caused different dynamics of riverine dom roth et al 2019 spencer et al 2019 moreover previous studies were based on a limited number of sampling sites near the existing hydrological stations or short reaches of the yangtze river bai et al 2015 wang et al 2021 due to various landform types and intense local human activities in the yangtze river basin the amount and quality of dom have been possibly altered dramatically over time therefore it is necessary to conduct more precise investigations along the entire stream with higher spatial and temporal resolution in this study surface water samples were collected from upstream to estuary of the yangtze river total distance 2300 km during two contrasting seasons due to chemical complexity and diversity of dom in a large river we combined a set of analytical methods including hydrological measurements elemental optical absorbance and fluorescence carbon isotope and molecular ft icr ms techniques our objectives were to 1 investigate the abundance sources and compositions of dom at highly spatial resolution in two seasons 2 clarify the transport and transformation of riverine dom at spatial and temporal scales and 3 explore the impacts of natural and anthropogenic forces on dom cycle 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site sample collection and in situ data the yangtze river has a total length of 6300 km and a drainage basin area of 1808 500 km2 from the qinghai tibetan plateau to the east china sea fig 1 based on hydrologic and geographical characteristics we divided the yangtze river into three reaches upstream reach

precipitation of 1054 mm average years 1961 2019 zhou et al 2021 due to asian ocean monsoons and anticyclone anomalies 70 of annual rainwater relatively higher temperature and uv radiation occur

half of the gross national product of china detailed climatic and economic information is provided in fig s1 this study was conducted along the main stream of the yangtze river from upstream near chongqing city to the estuary fig 1 surface water samples were collected with a 10 l niskin bottle pre cleaned by ph 2 hcl acidified water and ultrapure water in december 2020 samples yzd1 to 71 and in may 2021 samples yzm1 to 114 from a research vessel the two sampling periods had significant differences in monthly rainfall air temperature and river discharge wang and wu 2021 the first

organic carbon standard each sample and standard were measured five times and the standard deviation of δ 13cdoc was less than 0 4 finally all measurements were calibrated based on modified single point anchoring normalization to remove the influence of the isotopic composition of the blank paul et al 2007 2 4 pre treatment measurement and data analysis of ft icr ms a total of 37 dom samples 11

described dittmar et al 2008 details can be found in the supporting information 1 3 molecular analysis of extracted dom was performed on a 21 tesla ft icr ms with negative electrospray ionization located at the national high magnetic field laboratory in tallahassee florida usa smith et al 2018 the broadband mass spectrum was collected from 100 averaged time domain transients molecular formulae were assigned from mass spectral peaks with signals 6σ baseline root mean square noise behnke et al 2021 spencer et al 2019 using the petroorg software corilo 2015 elemental combinations of c1 45h1

anova and kruskal wallis test were performed to assess the significance of dom differences among seasons and river reaches in spss 19 0 software significance was reported as p 0 05 p 0 01 p 0 001 spearman correlation analysis was conducted in r 4 2 0 with the hmisc package principal component analysis pca was used to further examine dom variability in r 4 2 0 with the factoextra package and all variables were scaled to unit variance before pca 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentrations fluxes and sources of doc in the yangtze river the doc concentration along the yangtze river ranged from 1 30 mg c l 1 to 3 20 mg c l 1 average standard deviation 1 83 0 40 mg c l 1 in the dry season and 1 15 mg c l 1 to 3 43 mg c l 1 1 68 0 26 mg c l 1 in the wet season fig s3a b the doc concentration was not significantly different between the two seasons implying that the impoundment of the three gorges dam during the dry season did not lead to more doc decomposition though it could increase time residence of river water according to daily field records at hydrometric stations the doc flux was estimated to be approximately 0 038 0 094 tg c for the dry season month and 0 063 0 19 tg c for the early wet season month respectively higher doc flux during the wet season supports previous studies showing that discharge could control doc dynamics in lakes or rivers bao et al 2015 liu et al 2015 the doc flux in this study is much lower than other large rivers such as the mississippi amazon and congo rivers which is attributed to comparatively low doc concentration in the yangtze river liu et al 2015 the average doc value was highest downstream 1 94 0 37 mg c l 1 followed by upstream 1 60 0 19 mg c l 1 and midstream 1 60 0 23 mg c l 1 fig s6a the significant increase of doc from upstream reach to estuary reflected carbon accumulation with water flow although the dense population and rapid urbanization downstream likely increased doc inputs to the river fig s1a b the added doc was relatively low 4 mg c l 1 due to green development performed in china since 2016 zhou et al 2021 moreover the significantly positive relationship between doc concentration and water turbidity indicated that particulate organic carbon poc could be a source of doc which makes river browner impacting light penetration depth into water p 0 001 fig s3d δ 13cdoc varied between 26 90 and 21 06 with an average value of 25 24 1 13 in the dry season and between 27 69 and 22 12 with an average of 25 05 1 16 in the wet season fig 2 a there was no significant difference in δ 13cdoc values between the two seasons p 0 05 δ 13cdoc slightly increased with distance from the estuary which was higher upstream 24 34 1 20 than midstream 25 04 1 01 and downstream 25 76 0 79 based on the δ 13cdoc values the samples from different seasons and river reaches might have the same sources and or the intense mixing of river water made the δ 13cdoc signature to be more homogeneous along the yangtze river here we found that riverine doc was mainly originated from allochthonous and autochthonous organics the δ 13c distribution of allochthonous organics included terrestrial soil and plants litters around the watershed range 28 9 23 1 average 26 2 1 9 fig 2b are close to our samples δ 13cdoc values sun et al 2021 wu et al 2007 but the δ 13c values of autochthonous sources were more negative range 33 3 28 1 average 30 8 1 7 fig 2b because hydrophyte preferentially utilized dissolved 12c rich co2 δ 13c 7 during photosynthesis marty and planas 2008 since marine algae preferred bicarbonate δ 13c 0 as carbon sources instead of dissolved co2 their δ 13c increased to a relatively high average value 20 9 1 9 lamb et al 2006 the higher δ 13c value of autochthonous sources was also found in some eutrophic inland lakes e g taihu lake and dianchi lake because dissolved co2 was depleted to near zero value li et al 2022 meng et al 2021 but the phenonmenon was rare in the yangtze river therefore we suggested that allochthonous organic matter played a prominent contribution for the riverine dom pool which is consistent with some previous study results wen et al 2021 wu et al 2007 conversely autochthonous carbon sources did not contribute significantly due to high flow turbidity water depth and rocky bottom in situ phytoplankton and submerged plants growth in the yangtze river is limited wang et al 2014 some overlaps among the δ 13c ranges of allochthonous and autochthonous end members likely affect the accuracy of estimated results by bayesian mixing model therefore we should combine other techniques to provide more evidence for the diverse origins of riverine dom as will be discussed in next sections 3 2 variations in optical properties of riverine dom optical properties of dom showed obvious spatial difference along the yangtze river fig 3 4 and fig s6 a254 gradually increased downstream varying between 4 94 m 1 and 12 90 m 1 fig 3a suva254 had a significantly higher value downstream 2 38 0 33 l mg 1 m 1 than midstream 2 04 0 24 l mg 1 m 1 and upstream 1 96 0 38 l mg 1 m 1 p 0 001 fig s6c the average s 275 295 value was closed among downstream 0 016 0 002 midstream 0 016 0 003 and upstream 0 016 0 003 fig 4b and the difference didn t show statistical significance p 0 05 fig s6d these suggested that chromophoric dom cdom was constantly resupplied by surface runoff between midstream and downstream reaches the highest abundance of terrestrial t humic like components c2 and c3 range 0 22 2 35 r u and the low fi value range 1 22 1 76 indicated that the yangtze river was mainly associated with imported terrestrial humus leached from soils and litters from the notably higher f max value of t humic like components midstream 0 68 0 53 r u p 0 05 fig s6g we inferred that the additional terrestrial fluorescent dom fdom was transported by the han river which is the longest tributary of the yangtze river meanwhile hix was obviously higher midstream 6 99 3 30 than upstream 3 82 1 17 and downstream 3 47 1 58 p 0 001 fig s6l but fi decreased midstream 1 40 0 07 fig 4c increased amounts of t humic like components elevated the humification degree and terrestrial signal of dom the f max of the microbial m humic like component c1 and two protein like components c4 and c5 gradually increased downstream fig 3c and e f reflecting enhanced microbial metabolism and primary production which were closely related to densely agricultural and urban activities downstream chen et al 2021 tang et al 2020 the significantly higher bix downstream 1 06 0 39 p 0 01 fig s6k also pointed to a greater contribution of freshly autochthonous inputs however the autochthonous production was still lower throughout the whole river based on average bix 1 and a ratio of t humic like component to protein like component 1 consequently terrestrial organic matter possibly became the dominant organic carbon source to for the aquatic food web the c3 c4 grasses and invertebrates derived nutrients on land could be continuously assimilated by primary consumers contributing to consumers at higher trophic levels allan et al 2003 leite et al 2002 furthermore the characteristics of both cdom and fdom significantly changed from dry to wet seasons fig 3 4 a254 and f max of ct m humic like c1 and t humic like components c2 and c3 significantly increased by 0 97 m 1 0 11 r u and 0 30 r u on average in the dry season compared with those in the wet season p 0 01 despite terrestrial inputs would increase into yangtze river via high runoff during wet season pang et al 2021 increased river discharge eventually diluted cdom and humic like fdom concentrations fig s1c on the other hand enhanced solar uv radiation in summer promoted the penetration of light in water and rapidly decomposed photo reactive substances for example cdom and terrestrial humic like fdom in contrast the f max of tryptophan like c4 and bix had significantly higher values in the wet season p 0 01 phytoplankton growth and intense microbial activities would promote in situ primary production under warm temperature in the wet season fig s1d which released freshly protein like fractions s 275 295 and fi significantly decreased by 0 002 and 0 04 on average from wet season to dry season p 0 001 and hix significantly increased by 1 84 on average from wet season to dry season p 0 001 the seasonal cycle and hydrologic change left relatively more cdom and humic like fdom and meanwhile reduced protein like fdom in the dry season which increased the humification degree and terrestrial signal of riverine dom overall the total content of optical substance tended to accumulate downstream or in dry season but natural and anthropogenic factors directly or indirectly impacted the complexity of optical structures and components 3 3 general molecular signatures by ft icr ms the number of molecular formulae detected via ft icr ms analysis was in the range of 11 468 to 16 750 depending on the 37 samples the total number of formulae was 27 590 and the formulae pool would be gradually more saturated with increasing samples suggesting these riverine samples were highly representative the number of molecular formulae in the yangtze river is higher than in greenland glacier streams and a pacific temperate lake and similar to the mississippi river johnston et al 2022 kellerman et al 2021 vaughn et al 2021 larger rivers crossing complex watersheds generally show a higher number of dom formulae the majority of molecular mass covered the range of 200 1000 da fig s7a and showed a normal distribution centered at 630 30 da median value a total of 6895 common formulae was ubiquitous among all samples and usually appeared in the core of the van krevelen v k plot o c 0 50 0 12 h c 1 14 0 22 fig s7b the calculation of the relative abundance of elemental compositions fig s8 indicated that cho molecules 64 14 2 74 ra dominated followed by chon 24 18 2 21 ra chos 10 69 2 29 ra and chons molecules 0 99 0 34 ra based on o c h c and aimod molecular formulae were further divided into relatively stable compound groups i e ca polyphenolics and hups and active compound groups i e sugar like peptide like and aliphatic fig s7b hups compound had the highest relative abundance 44 18 2 16 ra at low o c 43 49 2 52 ra at high o c followed by aliphatic 5 39 1 54 ra and polyphenolics compound 5 00 0 79 ra fig s8 the other compounds represented less than 1 ra hups compounds were mainly derived from lignin metabolism and polyphenolics compounds were derived from terrestrial vascular plants but aliphatic compounds were usually produced by the fatty acids of phytoplankton behnke et al 2021 these further supported our isotopic and optical results on the overwhelming contribution of allochthonous dom throughout the yangtze river medeiros et al 2016 identified a set of 184 specific formulae referred as t peaks as plausibly indicative of the presence of terrigenous dom based on ft icr ms data from four rivers from different regions around the world including the arctic kolyma river subtropical altamaha river and equatorial amazon and congo rivers regions these t peaks were also found along the yangtze river n 142 177 and 139 t peaks were continuously observed from upstream to downstream reaches in both seasons table s3 worldwide large rivers have been confirmed to be important pools of terrigenous carbon on earth and could export the part that escaped from photo bio degradation and flocculation to coastal region and even the deep ocean the different proportions of compounds with different elemental compositions could control the inherent structural characteristics e g reactivity and persistence to compare them we calculated weight averaged wa values of all ft icr ms parameters based on their initial values divided by the relative intensity of each peak table s4 the masswa ranged from 518 55 to 567 10 da with an average value of 540 95 11 03 da aimod wa ranged from 0 25 to 0 29 and the average value was almost 2 7 fold higher than that of algal extracts aimod 0 11 lee et al 2019 dbewa varied between 11 07 and 12 54 with an average value of 11 67 0 42 these reflected that the abundant terrestrial materials e g hups and polyphenolic compounds raised the overall molecular weight aromaticity and unsaturated degree of dom in the yangtze river the average noscwa value of 0 12 0 03 was more positive than that of protein like substance 0 7 but fit with the nosc range of lignin like substance 0 2 to 0 1 indicating a reduced state of carbon zhou et al 2019 o cwa and h cwa ranged from 0 47 to 0 51 and 1 14 1 22 and had an average value of 0 50 0 01 and 1 18 0 02 respectively the relatively higher o c ratio and lower h c ratio indicated that our dom samples were less active due to a lower contribution of freshly autochthonous organic matter e g aliphatic and peptide like compounds 3 4 highlighted formulae selected from different riverine reaches and seasons the total number of molecular formulae assigned upstream 14 samples midstream 15 samples and downstream 8 samples was 23 531 24 866 and 22 686 respectively to better understand pronounced variations of dom molecules during the stream longitudinal process we screened out the highlighted molecular formulae of three reaches by comparing their average relative abundance of all mass peaks the results showed downstream samples had the highest number of highlighted formulae n 11 650 followed by midstream samples n 9190 and upstream samples n 6750 due to abundant common formulae these highlighted formulae of different reaches piled together in v k plots fig s9 however the average mass of the highlighted formulae midstream 713 03 da was higher than that upstream 621 93 da and downstream 581 91 da fig 5 a for molecule compound fractions table s5 the highlighted formulae upstream was mostly consisted of cho molecules 29 91 ra and hups with high o c compound 23 58 ra chos and chon molecules with hups with low o c polyphenolics and aliphatic compounds also had a significant contribution 1 ra molecular formulae were characterised as highly oxidized and aromatic the island of stability ios occupying a narrow range of molecular formulae o c 0 52 0 10 h c 1 17 0 13 mass 360 28 and 497 51 da was considered to be the most stable fraction kellerman et al 2018 ios had a higher abundance among the highlighted formulae upstream and was positively correlated with hups with high o c compound fig 6 and s10 suggesting that they are recalcitrant compounds with abundant carboxylic rich alicyclic molecules mainly originated upstream and could be long distance transported by river and finally stored in east china sea in the midstream reach the highlighted formulae were rich in cho molecules 22 22 ra and hups with low o c compound 20 84 ra table s5 resulting in highly unsaturated reduced and higher molecular weight dom meanwhile the relative abundance of chon molecules increased to 4 61 ra but the relative abundance of hups with high o c and polyphenolic compounds decreased greatly the consumption of oxygen rich and aromatic molecules between upstream and midstream reaches might be caused by photodegradation dilution and precipitation with iron minerals kamjunke et al 2019 in the highlighted formulae downstream the relative abundance of heteroatomic molecules markedly increased chon 17 18 ra chos 6 71 ra but cho molecules decreased to 12 01 ra table s5 hups compound still had the highest abundance but the added aliphatic compound 3 92 ra reduced dom unsaturation higher h c and lower dbe fig 6 moreover molecules above the microbial lability boundary mlbl h c 1 5 d andrilli et al 2015 were abundant downstream reflecting that the overall lability of molecules usually increased with more aliphatic and peptide like compounds regarding seasonality the total number of molecular formulae assigned in the dry season 11 samples and wet season 26 samples was 19 751 and 24 074 respectively we also compared average relative abundance of all mass peaks to find the highlighted molecular formulae which could better reflect seasonality samples in the dry season had less numbers of highlighted formulae n 11 694 than samples in the wet season n 15 896 fig s11 the mass distributions major elemental compositions and molecular compositions of highlighted formulae were different among the two seasons fig 5b and table s6 the relative abundance of cho and chon molecules was higher in the dry season and most of them were hups and polyphenolic compounds but chos molecules had a higher relative abundance in the wet season and most of them were hups and aliphatic compounds these compositional changes from dry to wet seasons also influenced the structural characteristics of molecules in the wet season highlighted formulae showed a higher h c ratio and lability by addition of aliphatic or mlbl compounds but that in dry season had relatively higher oxidized aromatic unsaturated and molecular weight characteristics fig 7 we also found that increased discharge during the wet season contributed more ios in the yangtze river fig 7 which was consistent with previous report kurek et al 2022 as a highly degraded refractory product ios was likely independent of its initial properties and sources 3 5 compositional assembly of riverine dom as determined by pca to explore the differences of dom pool in diverse riverine reaches or seasons we conducted five pca using isotopic and optical data in conjunction with abundant molecules ra 1 with highlighted formulae pc2 loading fig 8 a indicated the cho molecules and hups with high o c and polyphenolic compounds which had highest abundance in the highlighted formulae upstream were positively related to m humic like component and δ 13cdoc but were negatively correlated with a254 suva254 tp and tn additionally there was a significantly negative relationship between pc2 scores and distance from the estuary p 0 001 fig 8b we inferred that the dom pool upstream had low cdom content but was enrich in highly oxygenated aromatic and less hydrogenated molecules and microbial fdom components comprehensive ecological restoration in the yangtze river basin has increased the forest coverage upstream to approximately 50 a previous study reported molecular assemblages in forest stream had high o c ratio and aromatic fingerprints due to the dominance of hups and polyphenolic compounds from terrestrial surface soils and litter layers spencer et al 2019 however longitudinally higher flow along the river possibly limited the accumulation of terrestrial organic rich materials leading to lower cdom content upstream the dominant molecules e g cho ra and compounds e g hups with low o c ra midstream were strongly correlated with t humic like component in pc1 negative loading fig 8c and pc1 scores had a significantly negative correlation with hix value p 0 001 fig 8d the inflow of the han river contributed to greater amounts of terrestrial humic rich fractions coupled with low oxidized and high molecular weight hups compounds they were more concentrated midstream than in other two reaches and were considered as typical compositions of the dom pool midstream the major elemental composition and molecules of the highlighted formulae downstream with a254 suva254 protein like component tp and tn appeared in the pc1 positive loading fig 8e pc1 scores also had a significantly negative correlation with the distance from the estuary p 0 001 fig 8f as cropland and urban land increased agricultural practices anthropogenic sewage and associated enhanced primary productivity resulted in more heteroatomic formulae and labile aliphatic and protein like compounds in the dom pool downstream one of the most widely used surfactants for detergents in china is linear alkylbenzene sulfonates las which are composed of o3s compounds and can be degraded into o5s compounds under aerobic condition gong et al 2022 gonsior et al 2011 in this study these o3s and o5s compounds had a significantly positive correlation with chos molecules p 0 001 fig s12 on the other hand reductive sulfurization reaction probably also increased the abundance of chos molecules by exchanging one o atom by one s atom gomez saez et al 2016 moreover cdom content gradually increased downstream due to slow river flow and additional autochthonous organics major molecules and compounds of highlighted formulae in the dry season were strongly correlated with hix and t humic like component in pc1 negative loading fig 9 a b major molecules and compounds of highlighted formulae in the wet season were closely correlated with protein like component no3 n tn and tp in pc1 positive loading fig 9c d during the cold dry seasons the relatively weaker solar radiation and water dilution left more aromatic oxygenated higher unsaturated and molecular weight compounds e g hups and polyphenolics and terrestrial humic like components and meanwhile the autochthonous contribution was very low due to the absence of biological processes a few aliphatic and peptide like compounds derived from the microbial metabolism in soils were possibly transported to the river via surface runoff and groundwater and could be preserved due to cold temperatures in winter behnke et al 2021 during the warm and wet season increased temperature and nutrients inputs from agricultural activities promoted phytoplankton growth and microbial activities that released some freshly autochthonous dom fractions such as aliphatic and protein like compounds these bio available substances could serve as an additional substrate for primary production and microbial communities in the aquatic environment while their degradation would produce some greenhouse gasses emission overall our findings well demonstrated that rapid response of dom pool in a large river to surrounding conditions which play a greater influence on biogeochemical cycling of riverine and even coastal environments 4 conclusion the δ 13cdoc values indicated the dominance of allochthonous over autochthonous dom as confirmed by the high fluorescence intensity of the humic like components identified by eem parafac and the high relative abundance of hups compounds detected by ft icr ms riverine dom displayed significantly spatial and seasonal differences in the forest dominated upstream reach hups with high o c and polyphenolic compounds as well as microbial humic like component were relatively abundant however the accumulation of cdom content was limited due to higher flow these highly oxygenated aromatic and less hydrogenated dom fractions would also be partially degraded during longitudinal transport process the dom pool midstream was mainly consisted of hups with low o c compound and terrestrial humic like component with higher molecular weight unsaturation and humification degree the increasing cropland and urban land uses downstream contributed an amount of heteroatomic molecules and labile compounds to dom pool during dry cold seasons highly unsaturated aromatic and humified dom fractions were preserved due to weaker dilution and photo degradation the abundance of these fractions would decrease with increasing river discharge and solar irradiance during wet and warm season and meanwhile phytoplankton growth under warm temperature released some aliphatic and protein like compounds our findings revealed that riverine dom chemo diversity could be mainly caused by the hydrologic meteorological conditions and anthropogenic activities throughout the whole basin which improved our ability to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics and cycle of dom in a larger river in the future we will extend the study region to the east china sea to investigate biogeochemical cycling of dom in a changing hydrology region and further estimated specific terrestrial carbon injection into the ocean moreover laboratory based incubation experiments should be performed to provide insights on the overall reactivity of riverine molecules under bio and photo degradation processes based on discharge transport time declaration of competing interest we declare that we don t have any commercial

14937,estuarine mangrove wetlands have gradually declined owing to the growing construction of aquaculture ponds how the speciation transition and migration of phosphorus p adaptively change in the sediments of this pond wetland ecosystem remains unclear in this study we used high resolution devices to explore the contrasting p behaviors associated with the redox cycles of fe mn s as in estuarine and pond sediments the results showed that the construction of aquaculture ponds increased the content or percentage of the silt organic carbon and p fractions in sediments dissolved organic p dop concentrations in pore water were fluctuant with depths accounting for only 18 15 and 20 11 of total dissolved p tdp in estuarine and pond sediment respectively furthermore dop was less strongly correlated with other p species including fe mn and sulfide the coupling of dissolved reactive p drp and tdp with fe and sulfide confirmed that p mobility is regulated by fe redox cycling in estuarine sediments whereas fe iii reduction and sulfate reduction co regulate p remobilization in pond sediments the apparent diffusion flux revealed all sediments acting as sources for tdp 0 04 0 1 mg m 2 d 1 to the overlying water while mangrove sediments were sources of dop and pond sediments were major sources of drp the difs model overestimated the p kinetic resupply ability which was evaluated using drp rather than tdp this study improves our understanding of p cycling and budget in aquaculture pond mangrove ecosystems and has important implications for understanding water eutrophication more effectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus cycling shrimp farming benthic flux eutrophication sediment water interface data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuarine and coastal wetlands are transitional ecosystems where inland freshwater meets saline seawater crooks et al 2018 they are associated with various ecosystem services including coastal protection blue carbon sequestration benthic animal habitats and nutrient regulation valiela and fox 2008 zhu et al 2020 with the increase in human activity land use patterns have changed greatly causing a loss of approximately 50 of the world s coastal wetlands barbier et al 2011 the asia pacific region is one of the most active regions of wetland loss owing to rapid economic development which has led to the conversion of natural coastal wetlands into harbors real estate and aquaculture ponds zuo et al 2013 for example in china over 70 of mangroves have been lost larson 2015 and aquaculture pond areas have reached up to 1 0 104 km2 ren et al 2019 contributing to 60 of global aquatic production in 2016 fao 2016 coastal aquaculture can alleviate the contradiction between more people and less land in coastal areas however it remains unclear how natural mangrove conversion to aquaculture ponds affects the nutrient cycle rahman et al 2013 as a small artificial aquatic ecosystem there are many nutrients in the water body owing to artificial feeding which causes a series of serious ecological and environmental problems for example large aquaculture ponds can cause salination hou et al 2022 and water pollution xie et al 2004 furthermore eutrophication occurred in most ponds owing to excessive stocking and excessive feed given this some scholars have proposed a natural solution using the self purification capacity of wetlands to offset the discharged sewage to avoid hyper nutrification because some coastal wetlands often exist in the vicinity of aquaculture ponds boto 1992 for example 2 3 ha of mangrove wetlands in the vietnam region would be required to treat the nitrogen and phosphorus effluents released from every hectare of semi intensive shrimp ponds whereas for intensive ponds more than ten times the mangrove area might be required robertson and phillips 1995 with the development of high density aquaculture and the loss of mangrove wetlands contradictory conditions have gradually made this method unstable in addition more complex environmental effects across the sediment water interface caused by aquaculture production require further consideration in aquaculture ponds a large amount of organic matter such as residual bait excreta and corpses is deposited and accumulates in sediments some of which may get decomposed and cause the release and diffusion of nutrients into the overlying water under certain conditions thus causing the deterioration of aquaculture water quality ebeling et al 2006 whether sediments act as sources or sinks of contaminants to the overlying water depends mainly on the redox conditions and prevailing diagenetic processes shaughnessy et al 2019 pan et al 2019a because wetland sediments are generally silty resulting in low permeability the high organic matter content causes oxygen to be completely consumed within a few millimeters of the sediment surface holmer et al 2002 however the metabolism of organic matter in deep sediments does not stop owing to anoxia and organic matter undergoes further anaerobic oxidation after providing suitable electron acceptors through the reduction of no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 canfield et al 1993 as one of the crucial macronutrient elements in aquatic ecosystems phosphorus p often acts as the limiting factor for primary productivity benitez nelson 2000 in aquaculture ponds owing to artificial feed there is a large amount of excess p which negatively influences the ecosystem by causing eutrophication and harmful algal blooms kimambo et al 2021 p regeneration mainly occurs in the overlying water but can also occur in sediments if the depth of the overlying water is relatively shallow fisher et al 1982 for example approximately 50 of the sedimentation flux of particulate phosphorus can be mobilized within the sediment and returned to the water column of the laurentian trough in the gulf of st lawrence sundby et al 1992 the adsorption of metal oxides in sediments is thought to be one of the principal reactions in p cycling lijklema 1976 krom and berner 1981 the redox cycling of iron fe manganese mn arsenic as and sulfur s which are crucial components of early diagenesis plays a critical role in organic matter mineralization and internal p im mobilization canfield et al 1993 kraal et al 2014 hu et al 2022 for example p can be scavenged by fe and mn hydr oxides under oxic conditions sundby 2006 but can be remobilized and released into pore water from the reductive dissolution of iron and manganese oxides by reducing high valent metal loid s to low valent metal loid s under anoxic conditions bose and sharma 2002 further the reduction of fe iii oxides to fe ii via mediation by dissolved sulfide σs2 can coprecipitate as fes and or fes2 especially under highly sulfidic conditions in which orthophosphate does not suffer significantly adsorbing but p remobilization may occur lehtoranta et al 2009 however how changes in fe mn and s redox cycling which are the internal causes of p remobilization affect redox phosphorus cycling has not been completely elucidated in estuarine and pond sediments hu et al 2023 therefore this study focused on the effects of transferring estuarine wetlands to aquaculture ponds on phosphorus cycling including p composition redox mobilization kinetic resupply and source sink processes across the sediment water interface we combined conventional sediment analysis the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique and high resolution dialysis hr peeper to reveal the geochemical behavior of p in pore water p fractions in sediments and their relationships with the redox geochemistry of fe mn as and s our study sites were located in jiulong estuary in the fujian province which is a representative subtropical estuary along the southeast coast of china in recent years with the increasing demand for shrimp products large scale artificial aquaculture ponds have been constructed especially artificial captive land based shrimp ponds scattered all over estuarine tidal flats providing a suitable place for studying the phosphorus cycling process in pond sediments the results obtained from high resolution sampling could shed light on the geochemical cycling of p in the coexisting shrimp pond mangrove ecosystem and its exchange mechanism across the sediment water interface to resist water eutrophication more effectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study site the study site is located in a kandelia candel dominant mangrove coast in jiulong river estuary jre a semi enclosed estuary in southeastern china 24 23 40 n 117 55 31 e fig 1 this region has regular semidiurnal tides with a tidal range of 3 6 m and a subtropical oceanic monsoon climate with an annual rainfall of 1500 mm along the jre banks there are many shrimp penaeusvannamei farming ponds with water depths of 1 2 m the feed bait is rich in nutrients including protein 42 crude fat 4 0 crude fiber 3 0 calcium 1 0 3 0 and total phosphorus 1 0 the daily feeding amount was approximately 3 10 of the body weight of the shrimp yang et al 2017 four sampling sites two in shrimp ponds and the others in estuarine tidal flats were selected fig 1 an artificial embankment separates the estuarine sites from the shrimp ponds es 1 and es 2 are located in the mid tide and subtidal zones respectively aq 1 is located in a tidal creek that connects the aquaculture pond and estuary the elevation at aq 1 was similar to that at es 1 estuary water flows into the creek during rising tides and aquaculture pond water flows out when the tide retreats to keep the shrimp pond water fresh mangrove plants grew on both sides of the creek but the age and size of the trees were smaller on the pond side aq 1 than on the estuarine side es 1 aq 2 was located at the bottom of the shrimp pond 5 m from the tidal creek the four sampling sites are connected by a straight line approximately perpendicular to the embankment 2 2 preparation of the dgt and hr peeper probes the measuring principles of diffusive gradients in thin film dgt probes and high resolution dialysis hr peeper are presented elsewhere e g davison and zhang 1994 ding et al 2012 pan et al 2019a and are described briefly here the dgt sampler is an efficient technique based on fick s first law of diffusion for conducting in situ high resolution measurements of labile chemicals in sediments davison and zhang 1994 the p s content measured by dgt comes from the dissolved reactive phosphate drp dissolved sulfide i e h2s hs and s2 in the pore water and the release of easily exchangeable or mobile p s fractions from solids to resupply to the pore water which is referred to as dgt labile p s zhang et al 1995 therefore the dgt uptake process involves kinetic interactions of solid solution chemicals which are affected by their solid lability an hr peeper sampler was used to sample pore water to measure the concentrations of drp total dissolved phosphate tdp and dissolved metal loid s including as fe and mn in pore water hr peeper sampler contains 36 equally spaced 400 μl chambers fully loaded with deionized water with a vertical resolution of 5 mm and the chambers are covered by a cellulose nitrate membrane 0 45 μm pore size whatman the sampling principle of the hr peeper depends on diffusion equilibrium which allows solutes to diffuse across the membrane and achieve equilibrium after some deployment time teasdale et al 1995 the zro agi dgt consisted of binding gels of zr oxide and agi for the measurement of oxyanions p and as and free sulfides respectively the dgt and hr peeper devices were provided by easy sensor ltd china http www global easysensor com the samples were soaked in deoxidized deionized water until field deployment 2 3 field sampling campaigns all field sampling campaigns were conducted at low tide and lasted for three days on the first day two side by side hr peepers were slowly and vertically inserted into the sediment at each site leaving the top two centimeters approximately four chambers above the sediment to represent the overlying water on the second day the zro agi dgt was inserted into the sediment next to the hr peeper keeping the two devices facing each other and aligned at the top to ensure the same depth on the third day both the zro agi dgt and hr peeper were slowly removed from the sediments and the residual sediment on the devices was quickly washed with deionized water the samples were stored in plastic bags in a nitrogen environment and quickly returned to the laboratory for the next operation in addition surface sediments at the same depths as the dgt and hr peeper were collected using pvc tubes to analyze the chemical properties of the sediments quantitatively all plasticware used for sampling was cleaned via acid pickling and washed twice with deionized water during the sampling period the in situ temperature salinity dissolved oxygen and ph of the surface water were measured using the ysi professional plus multiparameter at the four sampling sites 2 4 laboratory analysis the hr peeper samplers were first processed in a laboratory a pipette gun was used to remove the water sample from each chamber and transfer it to a centrifugal tube one sample volume of nearly 800 μl followed by an organic phosphorus digestion experiment according to ma et al 2017 simply speaking the water sample was diluted 200 μl diluted to 320 μl and added with sodium persulfate solution then dissolved in 98 c water bath for 3 h and the organophosphate was digested into orthophosphate the concentrations of drp undigested original sample 200 μl diluted to 320 μl and tdp digested sample were determined by the molybdenum blue method using miniaturized spectrophotometry with an enspire microplate reader perkin elmer waltham ma usa laskov et al 2007 thus dissolved organic phosphorus dop is equal to the difference between tdp and drp the concentrations of dissolved metal loid s including mn fe and as in the diluted samples 200 μl diluted to 2 ml were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer nexion 2000 with an internal standard agilent p n 5183 4682 correcting for physical interference and instrument drift the binding gels of dgt samplers were scanned first using a flat bed scanner canon 5600f with a resolution of 600 dpi the scanned image was converted into grayscale intensities using imagej 1 46 software widerlund and davison 2007 subsequently the gel was sliced at 5 mm vertical intervals into 30 strips the strips were processed to elute as and p according to sun et al 2014 and ding et al 2012 dgt labile as in the eluate was measured by icp ms and dgt labile p in the eluate was measured using the molybdenum blue method as pore water samples above the surface sediments were first freeze dried subjected to particle size measurements using a mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk and finally screened to obtain the p fractions using sequential extraction of the standards measurements and testing program of the european commission smt procedure rydin 2000 five p fractions were extracted exchangeable p ex p fe al oxide bound p fe al p ca bound p ca p inorganic p ip and organophosphorus op because most inorganic p compounds in sediments belong to two groups those containing calcium and those containing iron and aluminum reddy et al 2011 ca p is the difference between ip and fe al p the sum of ip and op was termed total p tp total sulfur ts and organic carbon toc in the sediments were measured using a vario el iii elemental analyzer elementar germany the european community bureau of reference sequential extraction procedure was employed to extract the fractions of metal loid s i e mn fe and as including exchangeable and carbonate f1 reducible f2 oxidizable f3 and residual f4 fractions rauret et al 1999 the sum of which is referred to as the total content i e mn t or as t all elutes used for measuring the metal loid fractions were acidified and analyzed by icp ms procedural blanks replicates and reference materials were processed and examined for icp ms analyses internal standards 72ge 118in 209be were employed to calibrate instrumental drift and sensitivity to assess the accuracy of the analytical procedure reference material samples agilent p n 5183 4682 were repeatedly measured every 10 or 20 samples with recoveries of 97 102 for as mn and fe triplicate analyses were performed for all samples with an average relative standard deviation rsd of 3 2 6 4 on average in addition reference material samples art no 15 00 0062 and triplicate analyses were performed for every 10 or 20 samples for c and s with recoveries of 99 100 and rsd of less than 1 2 5 data processing and statistics following ding et al 2012 the dgt labile s mass m s μg cm 2 accumulated in the binding gel was estimated using the established calibration curve of grayscale density y versus m s x as shown in eq 1 1 y 171 e x 7 23 220 the mass m μg of dgt labile mn fe and as was calculated using the following equation 2 m c e v f where c e indicates the detected concentration in the elute v and f indicate the elution volume and efficiency respectively wang et al 2017 the content of dgt labile chemicals c dgt was calculated using the following equation zhang et al 1995 3 c dgt m δ g d a t m s δ g d t where δg is the diffusive layer thickness 0 08 cm d is the diffusion coefficient cm2 s 1 wang et al 2016 a is the effective area of the gel strip equaling 0 5 1 8 cm2 and t is the dgt deployment time the measured data were plotted using origin ver 9 software the other figures were plotted using corel draw ver 2018 software significant differences between different samples were analyzed using spss ver 20 0 software with one way anova followed by duncan s multiple range test the significance level was set at p 0 05 linear correlations and multiple regression analyses between different parameters were analyzed and plotted using pearson s correlation and asymptotic analysis in origin ver 2019b 2 6 difs model and interface flux estimation we employed the difs dgt induced fluxes in sediments model which is based on a pair of linked parabolic partial differential equations to simulate the release resupply kinetics from solid sediment to pore water perturbed by dgt following the below equations harper et al 2000 4 r c dgt c d 5 k d c s c d 6 t c 1 k 1 k 1 7 k 1 k 1 k d p c where r is the resupply coefficient in the range of 0 1 higher the value stronger resupply capacity k d indicates the distribution coefficient denoting the relatively content of sediment pool in regard to the potential resupply in this study dissolved as and p cd detected by hr peeper dgt labile cdgt and solids cs i e the sum of fractions f1 f2 and f3 for as and ex p for p were the major components used to calculate the input parameters harper et al 1998 the particle concentration p c was calculated as the ratio of c s to the pore water volume based on the input parameters this model can simulate the curves of r values with deployment time and calculate the output parameter t c which is the time required for the perturbed system to reach the equilibrium state then the desorption rate constant k 1 and adsorption rate constant k 1 were calculated using eqs 6 and 7 with higher values implying less time to desorb adsorb to from the pore water the interface flux through diffusion transport was estimated based on fick s first law and sediment tortuosity berner 1980 boudreau 1996 8 f φ d s 1 ln φ 2 d c d z where f and φ indicate the exchange flux and sediment porosity respectively φ was calculated based on the moisture content and sediment density d c d z is the concentration gradient for solutes i e drp tdp fe mn and as within surficial pore water top 2 cm and d s is the solute diffusion coefficient in pore water which was calculated from the solute diffusion coefficients in seawater multiplied by φ2 while φ 0 7 li and gregory 1974 ullman and aller 1982 3 results 3 1 properties of overlying water and sediment most of the physical and chemical properties of the overlying water showed the same regularity at the four sampling sites for example the do salinity and ph in the aquaculture ponds were higher than those in the estuarine water table s1 the main reason for this was that the aeration equipment in the ponds constantly exploded the gas leading to higher levels of dissolved oxygen in the water the salinity of the aquaculture pond was higher than that of the estuarine area because saline water can flow into the ponds from the sea during high tides sediment characteristics are more complex than those of the overlying water the particle size results showed that silt was the primary sediment type in both estuarine tidal flats and aquaculture ponds although regional differences were observed fig s1 the sediments at the bottom of the pond had a higher percentage of silt but a lower sand content than the estuarine sediment fig s1 indicating that the pond construction later changed the composition of the original estuarine sediments as shown in fig 2 the chemical characteristics of the sediments differed significantly between the aquaculture ponds and estuarine tidal flats for example the tp exchangeable p ex p fe al oxide bound p fe al p inorganic p ip and organic p op contents in aquaculture ponds are higher than those in estuarine tidal flats indicating a p enriched environment in pond sediments in addition when comparing the two tidal flat sites the closer to the aquaculture pond the higher the phosphorus content indicating that the aquaculture pond was an important p source it was found that aq 1 had a higher p content than aq 2 indicating that tidal creeks can effectively enrich p discharged from aquaculture ponds furthermore the fe al p content peaks at aq 1 accounting for 81 of the ip content total organic carbon toc and total reductive sulfur ts in aquaculture ponds were obviously higher than those in estuarine sediments but exhibited similar amounts of iron oxides fe ox aquaculture ponds are rich in artificial organic matter and p enrichment is prominent there were no significant differences in the spatial distribution of the as content and fractions indicating that there was no anthropogenic as contamination in the aquaculture ponds the residual pattern f4 dominated the as fractions and was higher than the exchangeable and carbonate f1 reducible f2 and oxidizable f3 patterns however the exchangeable and carbonate patterns f1 dominated the mn fractions and were higher in the estuarine tidal flats than in the aquaculture ponds the main reason may be that compared to estuarine tidal flats aquaculture ponds lack terrestrial input and the artificial embankment acts as a barrier making it difficult to import terrestrial suspended particles through the tidal creek furthermore mn is mainly derived from terrestrial inputs and is easily enriched in estuarine sediments trefry and presley 1982 3 2 properties of pore water the depth profiles of the in situ hr pepper derived pore water properties including the concentrations of drp tdp and soluble metal loid s are illustrated in fig 3 overall p in the aquaculture ponds was higher than that in the estuarine sediments which is consistent with the sediment results figs 3 and 4 in the vertical direction most elements showed an increasing trend with depth at all sampling sites for example the drp and tdp showed monotonically increasing trends in the intertidal zone es 1 and aquaculture ponds aq 1 and aq 2 however the drp and tdp in the subtidal zone es 2 showed a fluctuating trend of increasing from the overlying water to the sediment within a depth of 2 cm decreasing from 2 to 8 cm and then increasing again with depth the vertical variation in dop showed great spatial variability at the four sampling sites fig 5 among them es 1 in the intertidal zone and aq 2 in the aquaculture pond gradually increased with depth but showed a zigzag fluctuation in the subtidal zone i e es 2 at aq 1 the dop gradually increased with depth above 7 cm gradually decreased from to 7 12 cm and then gradually stabilized in the horizontal direction the relative proportion of dop was higher in the areas where mangroves grew i e es 1 and aq 1 which was consistent with op indicating that estuarine mangrove sediments were conducive to organophosphorus enrichment the vertical variation of as in pore water showed a gradual increase trend with depths in the estuarine tidal flat es 1 3 2 17 3 mg l 1 es 2 4 7 37 7 mg l 1 but was relatively constant with low variation ranges in aquaculture ponds aq 1 2 0 8 3 mg l 1 aq 2 4 8 11 1 mg l 1 the concentrations of fe and mn at the four sampling sites showed a trend of gradually increased with depth fig 3 in addition the relative variation ranges of fe and mn concentrations were higher in estuarine tidal flats than in aquaculture ponds indicating that fe mn concentrations were greatly affected by tidal hydrology in estuarine tidal flats figs 3 and 4 3 3 properties of dgt labile s p and as the 2d vertical distribution of dgt labile s at various depths displayed significant variations during the transition from estuarine tidal flats to aquaculture ponds fig 6 the dgt labile s in the estuarine sediments was homogenous with a low variation range 0 0 05 mg l 1 in concentrations the low concentrations of dgt labile s at es 1 may have been caused by the deep oxidation zone whereas those at es 2 may have been caused by poor organic matter fig 2 in contrast the concentrations of dgt labile s in the aquaculture pond were significantly higher than those in the estuarine tidal flat and were highly heterogeneous for example the concentrations of dgt labile s were very low at depths of 0 6 cm at aq 1 and then gradually increased with depth in particular the dgt labile s at aq 2 varied by different degrees through the dgt device and increased by a factor of 10 up to 0 2 mg l 1 at a depth of 10 14 cm except for es 2 in the subtidal zone the vertical distribution of dgt labile p likely increases with depth in addition to sediments and pore water the concentrations of dgt labile p in aquaculture ponds were significantly higher than those in the estuarine tidal flats fig 4 we further transformed the two dimensional dgt labile s into a one dimensional vertical distribution and found that the depth zone with a high concentration fig 6 and variation range fig 4 was generally consistent with those of dgt labile p especially in aquaculture ponds the vertical distributions of dgt labile as were nearly consistent with those of soluble as in the pore water figs 3 and 6 the as concentrations were relatively high in the pond sediments but relatively divergent in the estuarine sediments especially at es 2 overall most of the vertical distributions at the four sampling sites showed clear horizontal heterogeneity at certain depths 3 4 p exchange between overlying water and sediments the apparent diffusion fluxes between the pore water and the overlying water were revealed by the positive values 0 04 0 1 mg m 2 d 1 for tdp release to the overlying water but there were large differences for drp and dop fig 7 a the exchange flux of the tdp reached its maximum at aq 1 which connects the aquaculture ponds and the tidal flat in particular the dop diffused from the sediments into the overlying water in the mangrove growing zone i e es 1 and aq 1 with a flux range of 0 05 0 06 mg m 2 d 1 indicating that the mangrove sediment is an important source of organic phosphorus for overlying water in contrast the sediment in the subtidal zone i e es 2 acted as a sink for organophosphorus whereas the dop exchange flux across the sediment water interface at aq 2 was almost negligible in conclusion all four sampling sites showed upward drp exchange from sediments to overlying water with a flux range of 0 05 0 09 mg m 2 d 1 as shown in fig 7b the diffusion fluxes of metal loid s as 0 02 14 75 mg m 2 d 1 mn 0 002 12 6 mg m 2 d 1 fe 0 11 1 33 mg m 2 d 1 reached the maximum at es 2 reducing environment followed by the aquaculture zone oxidizing environment and the minimum at es 1 oxidizing environment compared with es 2 es 1 in the intertidal zone suffered periodic seawater inundation and soil aeration and thus had a higher content of dissolved oxygen the anoxic reduction environment at es 2 was more conducive to the release of as fe mn from sediments into the overlying water 4 discussions 4 1 p mobilization associated with fe mn as s cycling in the pore water profiles the mn concentration was higher than that of fe except at aq 1 indicating that mn reduction contributed more to the mineralization of organic matter canfield et al 1993 the low contents of mn and as in the sediment and the consistent patterns of mn and as in the pore water of the aquaculture ponds figs 2 and 4 indicate that the artificial input of mn and as was insignificant and as release passivation was dominated by mn redox cycling ying et al 2011 however the fe concentration in the tidal creek aq 1 was significantly higher than that of mn which may be ascribed to frequent human dredging of the waterway which is conducive to the reduction and reoxidation of iron oxides chen et al 2018 dgt s is enriched at deep depths in aquaculture ponds featuring more organic matter to favor sulfate reduction and produce more sulfide lovley and phillips 1987 in addition dgt labile as was significantly reduced under sulfidic conditions which may be ascribed to the co precipitation or organic complexation of as and sulfur forming an iron arsenic sulfur complex leading to the passivation of as kirk et al 2004 overall the distributions of dissolved fe mn and dgt labile s indicated a complex competitive relationship between their redox cycling that is mn cycling dominated in estuarine sediments and fe and s cycling dominated in pond sediments the chemical characteristics of p in the sediments were significantly different between the aquaculture ponds and estuarine tidal flats for example the spatial distributions of the tp and p fractions including ex p fe al p ip and op were higher in pond sediments than in estuarine sediments fig 2 indicating that the construction of aquaculture ponds tends to enrich p in sediments which may be attributed to anthropogenic pollution ebeling et al 2006 in addition the relative proportion of dop to tp dop in pore water was higher in areas where mangroves grew i e es 1 and aq 1 which was consistent with op indicating that estuarine mangrove sediments were beneficial for organophosphorus enrichment you et al 2022 in pore water profiles except for site es 2 dop concentrations fluctuated and tended to increase at deeper depths fig 5 showing that dop was decomposed and mobilized under anoxic conditions this is similar to the drp verified in a previous study cermelj et al 1997 nevertheless the high dop values appearing at subsurface depths 4 8 cm were clearly inconsistent with those of drp and tdp indicating different activation mechanisms between drp and dop furthermore both dop concentrations and dop were inconsistent with dissolved fe mn and dgt labile s in the depth profiles confirming that the activation of dop was not controlled by the redox cycling of fe mn and s for lateral variation at the four sites the profile averaged dop concentration mainly depended on the sediment p content especially op and ex p figs 8 and s2 which has been verified in a previous study monbet et al 2010 accordingly the low dop concentrations and dop were attributed to the poor sediment p content in the bare mudflat generally the local mobilization and enrichment of dop in pore water profile 0 3 mg l 1 and 50 tdp demonstrated that dop is an important component of the p cycle and can be regarded as a quantitatively significant p fraction in pore water monbet et al 2009 unlike dop drp concentration showed increasing trend with less fluctuation in pore water profiles fig 3 which was highly consistent with tdp since drp accounted most for tdp 81 4 7 9 on average although drp and tdp showed good correlation and synchronous trends with dissolved fe and mn in the four profiles figs 3 and 8 as well as more intense mn reduction the adsorption release of p was mainly controlled by fe cycling rather than mn the reason for this was the better correlation between drp tdp and fe but not mn for the profile averaged values at the four sites fig s2 in particular aq 1 had the highest fe and drp tdp and the lowest mn concentrations whereas es 2 had the highest mn and lowest drp tdp concentrations this verified the mechanism of fe redox controlled p release adsorption in sediments proposed by pan et al 2019b who investigated the fe s p biogeochemistry in tidal flat sediments near our sampling sites this also explains the low drp tdp concentrations in estuarine sediments as fe reduction was weak in pond sediments dgt labile s was positively correlated with dgt labile p drp and tdp indicating that sulfate reduction may activate p release probably via op mineralization and or fe p remobilization pan et al 2020 overall drp or tdp activation was controlled by fe cycling in the estuarine sediments and by both fe and s cycling in the pond sediments 4 2 p kinetic resupply evaluated by the difs model the kinetic resupply of p from sediment to pore water was evaluated using the difs model the values of the input and output parameters modeled by the difs for drp tdp and as in the surface sediments are summarized in table 1 we found that traditionally using drp as the phosphorus concentration in pore water is inaccurate through the difs simulation model using drp and tdp as proxies for the p concentration in pore water it was found that the difs simulated r curves i e the kinetic resupply ability of p from sediments to pore water were significantly different fig 9 a and b r values decreased especially in mangrove growing areas where organophosphorus was relatively abundant furthermore except for es 2 the estimated r values using drp were stable when they increased to a high value whereas the estimated r values using tdp increased to the same high value but then continuously decreased indicating that the resupply capacity continuously decreased pan et al 2019a this indicates that previous studies that used only drp as a proxy for pore water p concentration to model and evaluate the kinetics of p adsorption and desorption between sediment and pore water were unreasonable for as the continuous decrease in r values indicated that the resupply capacity decreased over time suggesting that the risk of arsenic activation release from the sediments was negligible in the study sites the relative values of the model output parameters t c response time k1 sorption rate and k 1 desorption rate were consistent with r values the higher the r value the smaller the tc but the larger k1 and k 1 that is the faster the adsorption desorption and equilibrium rates the stronger the resupply capacity from sediment to pore water harper et al 1998 2000 this will lead to the typical results during the establishment of the initial time diffusion equilibrium r value remained stable after reaching the peak and only slowly decreased to equilibrium with time e g drp in four sampling sites and tdp at aq 2 and es 2 r 0 38 in contrast the lower r value the larger t c and the smaller k1 and k 1 indicating that the adsorption desorption rate and equilibrium rate were slower and the resupply ability from sediment to pore water was weaker wu et al 2016 this resulted in a peak value of r during the establishment of the initial time diffusion equilibrium followed by a significant decrease e g as in four sampling sites and tdp at aq 1 and es 1 r 0 3 compared with drp it can be found that tdp had larger t c and smaller k1 and k 1 in most sampling points except es 2 which means that the resupply ability was weakened in other words the difs simulation with drp as a proxy for pore water p concentration overestimated the ability of the sediment to resupply pore water p during dgt placement compared with the drp and tdp the adsorption desorption and equilibrium rates of as were slower and the resupply ability from sediment to pore water was weaker in addition owing to the adsorption of as in the pore water by the dgt the resupply capacity also decreased with time fig 9c which further proved that the pollution risk of as activation and release was very low in the study sites 4 3 interface p source sink pattern although p is an essential element for marine organisms it generally has low concentrations in coastal environments and p limitation has been widely observed in oligotrophic oceans and coastal seas wu et al 2000 krom et al 2004 however owing to increasing anthropogenic activities such as the establishment of aquaculture ponds rahman et al 2013 ren et al 2019 p concentration has increased sharply causing marine eutrophication and hypoxic or oxygen depletion conditions diaz and rosenberg 2008 thus the p source sink pattern in aquaculture ponds may regulate the nutrient budget and primary production in coastal oceans benitez nelson 2000 paytan and mclaughlin 2007 in this study we comparatively explored the exchange flux of p across the sediment water interface in estuarine tidal flats and aquaculture ponds and found that sediment was mostly the source of p for the overlying water fig 7 only at the intertidal es 1 and subtidal es 2 the sediments were slight sinks of drp and dop respectively in addition although the p concentrations in both the sediment and pore water of the aquaculture ponds were much higher than those in the tidal flat figs 2 and 4 the p flux from the sediment to the overlying water was not higher than that of the tidal flat a possible reason for this is that continuous artificial feeding in the ponds caused the concentration gradient of p between the sediment and overlying water to be relatively small that is a quasi equilibrium state may have been reached in addition the sediments in the mangrove growing area i e es 1 and aq 1 were sources of dop fig 6 which was consistent with the higher organophosphorus concentrations in the sediments fig 2 furthermore we compared the exchange fluxes of p including drp dop and tdp across the sediment water interface among different aquatic systems including aquaculture ponds seabeds salt marshes and mangroves table 2 the comparison showed that our results were well within the ranges estimated in other studies for example wang et al 2011 found the diffusive flux of tdp ranged from 0 003 to 0 93 mg m 2 d 1 which was close to our flux estimations both in mangrove tidal flat and aquaculture ponds however the exchange fluxes of p at most of the other sites were significantly larger than our estimations for example in the fish ponds of spain morata et al 2012 and france lefebvre et al 2001 the diffusional fluxes of tdp were as high as 30 30 and 431 10 mg m 2 d 1 respectively the tdp flux ranges were also as high as 9 9 and 27 5 mg m 2 d 1 in canada burt et al 2013 and poland łukawska matuszewska and burska 2011 respectively the exchange fluxes in the shrimp and shellfish ponds were significantly lower in vietnam china and france table 2 in summary although the p exchange fluxes in shrimp ponds and coastal wetlands were relatively small they are still an unignored p source for the surrounding coastal waters because of their worldwide distribution and anthropogenic internal p enrichment 4 4 environmental implications the c p ratio indicates p enrichment and or the potential limitation of p in biotic communities cleveland and liptzin 2007 we further estimated the organic c p molar ratios in the sediments which were ranked as aq 1 60 0 es 1 93 1 es 2 84 8 aq 2 168 5 this indicates that the mangrove sediments i e es 1 and aq 1 tended to be more organic p enriched than the subtidal zone at es 2 and the aquaculture pond at aq 2 where p is increasingly decoupled from c but may be regulated by an inorganic mineral p retention mechanism reddy et al 1999 in addition soil organic matter and plant detritus normally function as major storage pools of organic p reddy et al 1999 furthermore p storage is mediated through direct p assimilation by microbes and algae that colonize detrital plant tissues in the water column and sediment surface reddy et al 2011 although the p flux released from the sediment in the aquaculture ponds was not larger than that in the estuarine tidal flat the p concentrations in both the sediment and pore water in the aquaculture ponds were much greater than those in the tidal flat this suggests that aquaculture ponds are a potential source of p pollution in estuarine surface waters because changes in the breeding pattern in the ponds or external weather conditions such as rainfall will likely increase the p concentration gradient between the sediment and overlying water and further p release in addition as we found many exposed clastic bedrocks near the bank embankment in the field the base of the whole bank embankment can be regarded as a relatively permeable aquifer thus as schematically shown in fig 10 there is likely a large exchange of groundwater and solutes associated with submarine groundwater discharge i e sgd moore 1996 between the estuarine tidal flats and aquaculture ponds for example we found that in subtidal zone es 2 which was near the low tide line drp and tdp first increased from the overlying water to a 2 cm depth of sediment then decreased from 2 cm to 8 cm and then increased again with depth fig 3 this may be caused by seepage flow or lateral subsurface groundwater flow from aquaculture ponds to the tidal flat because the area close to the low tide line tended to be the site of the largest sgd excretion rate across the sediment water interface e g gardner 2005 wilson and gardner 2006 xiao et al 2019 recent studies have shown that aquaculture in coastal shrimp ponds may increase the flux of submarine groundwater discharge hou et al 2022 however the specific amount of p flux discharged from aquaculture ponds into the estuary through sgd needs to be further determined by hydrochemical monitoring and numerical simulation in the future but it is of great research significance last but not the least our research results emphasized that the construction of aquaculture ponds has changed the p cycling mechanism and the interface source sink process however the study was conducted in a local area over a limited time period further work is required at more study sites particularly those covering different latitudes aquaculture types and wetland types we suggest that p mobilization and kinetic resupply in aquaculture ponds are sensitive to temporal variability at short diurnal middle initial middle and late feeding stages and long seasonal timescales further research on adjusting feeding strategies and preventing internal p loading will aid in management decisions supporting the sustainability of both pond construction and the restoration of estuarine wetlands for optimal p removal especially in the context of rapid global changes and expanding marine aquaculture 5 conclusions this study provides early insights into the differences in phosphorus cycling including p composition redox mobilization kinetic resupply and source sink processes across the sediment water interface caused by the conversion of estuarine mangrove wetlands to shrimp ponds the combination of conventional sediment analysis high resolution dialysis hr peeper and dgt technology was verified as a robust methodology for synchronously determining dissolved fe mn as and p concentrations in pore water and dgt labile s in sediment to explore the kinetic mechanism of p remobilization in aquaculture ponds and estuarine tidal flats and their benthic exchange fluxes we conclude that the aquaculture pond was rich in artificial organic matter and dgt labile s and phosphorus enrichment was prominent the mn concentration in the pore water was higher than that of iron indicating that mn contributed more than iron to the reduced mineralization of organic matter the vertical distributions were roughly similar between fe and p and between mn and as indicating that p release adsorption was controlled by fe redox in the sediments but as release and passivation were dominated by mn redox cycling furthermore significant correlations were found between p content and metal loid and sulfide content demonstrating that the availability and mobilization of p were driven by complex fe mn as s cycling in particular the relative proportions of dop to tp and the diffusion fluxes were higher in areas where mangroves grew indicating that mangrove sediments were conducive to organophosphorus enrichment overall these clear distinctions in p mobilization and kinetic resupply between anthropogenic aquaculture ponds and natural estuarine mangroves are critical for quantifying p source sink processes thus curbing water eutrophication and the effective management of tidal flats in the jiulong river estuary and other

14937,estuarine mangrove wetlands have gradually declined owing to the growing construction of aquaculture ponds how the speciation transition and migration of phosphorus p adaptively change in the sediments of this pond wetland ecosystem remains unclear in this study we used high resolution devices to explore the contrasting p behaviors associated with the redox cycles of fe mn s as in estuarine and pond sediments the results showed that the construction of aquaculture ponds increased the content or percentage of the silt organic carbon and p fractions in sediments dissolved organic p dop concentrations in pore water were fluctuant with depths accounting for only 18 15 and 20 11 of total dissolved p tdp in estuarine and pond sediment respectively furthermore dop was less strongly correlated with other p species including fe mn and sulfide the coupling of dissolved reactive p drp and tdp with fe and sulfide confirmed that p mobility is regulated by fe redox cycling in estuarine sediments whereas fe iii reduction and sulfate reduction co regulate p remobilization in pond sediments the apparent diffusion flux revealed all sediments acting as sources for tdp 0 04 0 1 mg m 2 d 1 to the overlying water while mangrove sediments were sources of dop and pond sediments were major sources of drp the difs model overestimated the p kinetic resupply ability which was evaluated using drp rather than tdp this study improves our understanding of p cycling and budget in aquaculture pond mangrove ecosystems and has important implications for understanding water eutrophication more effectively graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords phosphorus cycling shrimp farming benthic flux eutrophication sediment water interface data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction estuarine and coastal wetlands are transitional ecosystems where inland freshwater meets saline seawater crooks et al 2018 they are associated with various ecosystem services including coastal protection blue carbon sequestration benthic animal habitats and nutrient regulation valiela and fox 2008 zhu et al 2020 with the increase in human activity land use patterns have changed greatly causing a loss of approximately 50 of the world s coastal wetlands barbier et al 2011 the asia pacific region is one of the most active regions of wetland loss owing to rapid economic development which has led to the conversion of natural coastal wetlands into harbors real estate and aquaculture ponds zuo et al 2013 for example in china over 70 of mangroves have been lost larson 2015 and aquaculture pond areas have reached up to 1 0 104 km2 ren et al 2019 contributing to 60 of global aquatic production in 2016 fao 2016 coastal aquaculture can alleviate the contradiction between more people and less land in coastal areas however it remains unclear how natural mangrove conversion to aquaculture ponds affects the nutrient cycle rahman et al 2013 as a small artificial aquatic ecosystem there are many nutrients in the water body owing to artificial feeding which causes a series of serious ecological and environmental problems for example large aquaculture ponds can cause salination hou et al 2022 and water pollution xie et al 2004 furthermore eutrophication occurred in most ponds owing to excessive stocking and excessive feed given this some scholars have proposed a natural solution using the self purification capacity of wetlands to offset the discharged sewage to avoid hyper nutrification because some coastal wetlands often exist in the vicinity of aquaculture ponds boto 1992 for example 2 3 ha of mangrove wetlands in the vietnam region would be required to treat the nitrogen and phosphorus effluents released from every hectare of semi intensive shrimp ponds whereas for intensive ponds more than ten times the mangrove area might be required robertson and phillips 1995 with the development of high density aquaculture and the loss of mangrove wetlands contradictory conditions have gradually made this method unstable in addition more complex environmental effects across the sediment water interface caused by aquaculture production require further consideration in aquaculture ponds a large amount of organic matter such as residual bait excreta and corpses is deposited and accumulates in sediments some of which may get decomposed and cause the release and diffusion of nutrients into the overlying water under certain conditions thus causing the deterioration of aquaculture water quality ebeling et al 2006 whether sediments act as sources or sinks of contaminants to the overlying water depends mainly on the redox conditions and prevailing diagenetic processes shaughnessy et al 2019 pan et al 2019a because wetland sediments are generally silty resulting in low permeability the high organic matter content causes oxygen to be completely consumed within a few millimeters of the sediment surface holmer et al 2002 however the metabolism of organic matter in deep sediments does not stop owing to anoxia and organic matter undergoes further anaerobic oxidation after providing suitable electron acceptors through the reduction of no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 canfield et al 1993 as one of the crucial macronutrient elements in aquatic ecosystems phosphorus p often acts as the limiting factor for primary productivity benitez nelson 2000 in aquaculture ponds owing to artificial feed there is a large amount of excess p which negatively influences the ecosystem by causing eutrophication and harmful algal blooms kimambo et al 2021 p regeneration mainly occurs in the overlying water but can also occur in sediments if the depth of the overlying water is relatively shallow fisher et al 1982 for example approximately 50 of the sedimentation flux of particulate phosphorus can be mobilized within the sediment and returned to the water column of the laurentian trough in the gulf of st lawrence sundby et al 1992 the adsorption of metal oxides in sediments is thought to be one of the principal reactions in p cycling lijklema 1976 krom and berner 1981 the redox cycling of iron fe manganese mn arsenic as and sulfur s which are crucial components of early diagenesis plays a critical role in organic matter mineralization and internal p im mobilization canfield et al 1993 kraal et al 2014 hu et al 2022 for example p can be scavenged by fe and mn hydr oxides under oxic conditions sundby 2006 but can be remobilized and released into pore water from the reductive dissolution of iron and manganese oxides by reducing high valent metal loid s to low valent metal loid s under anoxic conditions bose and sharma 2002 further the reduction of fe iii oxides to fe ii via mediation by dissolved sulfide σs2 can coprecipitate as fes and or fes2 especially under highly sulfidic conditions in which orthophosphate does not suffer significantly adsorbing but p remobilization may occur lehtoranta et al 2009 however how changes in fe mn and s redox cycling which are the internal causes of p remobilization affect redox phosphorus cycling has not been completely elucidated in estuarine and pond sediments hu et al 2023 therefore this study focused on the effects of transferring estuarine wetlands to aquaculture ponds on phosphorus cycling including p composition redox mobilization kinetic resupply and source sink processes across the sediment water interface we combined conventional sediment analysis the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt technique and high resolution dialysis hr peeper to reveal the geochemical behavior of p in pore water p fractions in sediments and their relationships with the redox geochemistry of fe mn as and s our study sites were located in jiulong estuary in the fujian province which is a representative subtropical estuary along the southeast coast of china in recent years with the increasing demand for shrimp products large scale artificial aquaculture ponds have been constructed especially artificial captive land based shrimp ponds scattered all over estuarine tidal flats providing a suitable place for studying the phosphorus cycling process in pond sediments the results obtained from high resolution sampling could shed light on the geochemical cycling of p in the coexisting shrimp pond mangrove ecosystem and its exchange mechanism across the sediment water interface to resist water eutrophication more effectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study site the study site is located in a kandelia candel dominant mangrove coast in jiulong river estuary

annual rainfall of 1500 mm along the jre banks there are many shrimp penaeusvannamei farming ponds with water depths of 1 2 m the feed bait is rich in nutrients including protein 42 crude fat 4 0

the others in estuarine tidal flats were selected fig 1 an artificial embankment separates the estuarine sites from the shrimp ponds es 1 and es 2 are located in the mid tide and subtidal zones respectively aq 1 is located in a tidal creek that connects the aquaculture pond and estuary the elevation at aq 1 was similar to that at es 1 estuary water flows into the creek during rising tides and aquaculture pond water flows out when the tide retreats to keep the shrimp pond water fresh mangrove plants grew on both sides of the creek but the age and size of the trees were smaller on the pond side aq 1 than on the estuarine side es 1 aq 2 was located at the bottom of the shrimp pond 5 m from the tidal creek the four sampling sites are connected by a straight line approximately perpendicular to the embankment 2 2 preparation of the dgt and hr peeper probes the measuring principles of diffusive gradients in thin film dgt probes and high resolution dialysis hr peeper are presented elsewhere e g davison and zhang 1994 ding et al 2012 pan et al 2019a and are described briefly here the dgt sampler is an efficient technique based on fick s first law of diffusion for conducting in situ high resolution measurements of labile chemicals in sediments davison and zhang 1994 the p s content measured by dgt comes from the dissolved reactive phosphate drp dissolved sulfide i e h2s hs and s2 in the pore water and the release of easily exchangeable or mobile p s fractions from solids to resupply to the pore water which is referred to as dgt labile p s zhang et al 1995 therefore the dgt uptake process involves kinetic interactions of solid solution chemicals which are affected by their solid lability an hr peeper sampler was used to sample pore water to measure the concentrations of drp total dissolved phosphate tdp and dissolved metal loid s including as fe and mn in pore water hr peeper sampler contains 36 equally spaced 400 μl chambers fully loaded with deionized water with a vertical resolution of 5 mm and the chambers are covered by a cellulose nitrate membrane 0 45 μm pore size whatman the sampling principle of the hr peeper depends on diffusion equilibrium which allows solutes to diffuse across the membrane and achieve equilibrium after some deployment time teasdale et al 1995 the zro agi dgt consisted of binding gels of zr oxide and agi for the measurement of oxyanions p and as and free sulfides respectively the dgt and hr peeper devices were provided by easy sensor ltd china http www global easysensor com the samples were soaked in deoxidized deionized water until field deployment 2 3 field sampling campaigns all field sampling campaigns were conducted at low tide and lasted for three days on the first day two side by side hr peepers were slowly and vertically inserted into the sediment at each site leaving the top two centimeters approximately four chambers above the sediment to represent the overlying water on the second day the zro agi dgt was inserted into the sediment next to the hr peeper keeping the two devices facing each other and aligned at the top to ensure the same depth on the third day both the zro agi dgt and hr peeper were slowly removed from the sediments and the residual sediment on the devices was quickly washed with deionized water the samples were stored in plastic bags in a nitrogen environment and quickly returned to the laboratory for the next operation in addition surface sediments at the same depths as the dgt and hr peeper were collected using pvc tubes to analyze the chemical properties of the sediments quantitatively all plasticware used for sampling was cleaned via acid pickling and washed twice with deionized water during the sampling period the in situ temperature salinity dissolved oxygen and ph of the surface water were measured using the ysi professional plus multiparameter at the four sampling sites 2 4 laboratory analysis the hr peeper samplers were first processed in a laboratory a pipette gun was used to remove the water sample from each chamber and transfer it to a centrifugal tube one sample volume of nearly 800 μl followed by an organic phosphorus digestion experiment according to ma et al 2017 simply speaking the water sample was diluted 200 μl diluted to 320 μl and added with sodium persulfate solution then dissolved in 98 c water bath for 3 h and the organophosphate was digested into orthophosphate the concentrations of drp undigested original sample 200 μl diluted to 320 μl and tdp digested sample were determined by the molybdenum blue method using miniaturized spectrophotometry with an enspire microplate reader perkin elmer waltham ma usa laskov et al 2007 thus dissolved organic phosphorus dop is equal to the difference between tdp and drp the concentrations of dissolved metal loid s including mn fe and as in the diluted samples 200 μl diluted to 2 ml were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms perkinelmer nexion 2000 with an internal standard agilent p n 5183 4682 correcting for physical interference and instrument drift the binding gels of dgt samplers were scanned first using a flat bed scanner canon 5600f with a resolution of 600 dpi the scanned image was converted into grayscale intensities using imagej 1 46 software widerlund and davison 2007 subsequently the gel was sliced at 5 mm vertical intervals into 30 strips the strips were processed to elute as and p according to sun et al 2014 and ding et al 2012 dgt labile as in the eluate was measured by icp ms and dgt labile p in the eluate was measured using the molybdenum blue method as pore water samples above the surface sediments were first freeze dried subjected to particle size measurements using a mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd uk and finally screened to obtain the p fractions using sequential extraction of the standards measurements and testing program of the european commission smt procedure rydin 2000 five p fractions were extracted exchangeable p ex p fe al oxide bound p fe al p ca bound p ca p inorganic p ip and organophosphorus op because most inorganic p compounds in sediments belong to two groups those containing calcium and those containing iron and aluminum reddy et al 2011 ca p is the difference between ip and fe al p the sum of ip and op was termed total p tp total sulfur ts and organic carbon toc in the sediments were measured using a vario el iii elemental analyzer elementar germany the european community bureau of reference sequential extraction procedure was employed to extract the fractions of metal loid s i e mn fe and as including exchangeable and carbonate f1 reducible f2 oxidizable f3 and residual f4 fractions rauret et al 1999 the sum of which is referred to as the total content i e mn t or as t all elutes used for measuring the metal loid fractions were acidified and analyzed by icp ms procedural blanks replicates and reference materials were processed and examined for icp ms analyses internal standards 72ge 118in 209be were employed to calibrate instrumental drift and sensitivity to assess the accuracy of the analytical procedure reference material samples agilent p n 5183 4682 were repeatedly measured every 10 or 20 samples with recoveries of 97 102 for as mn and fe triplicate analyses were performed for all samples with an average relative standard deviation rsd of 3 2 6 4 on average in addition reference material samples art no 15 00 0062 and triplicate analyses were performed for every 10 or 20 samples for c and s with recoveries of 99 100 and rsd of less than 1 2 5 data processing and statistics following ding et al 2012 the dgt labile s mass m s μg cm 2 accumulated in the binding gel was estimated using the established calibration curve of grayscale density y versus m s x as shown in eq 1 1 y 171 e x 7 23 220 the mass m μg of dgt labile mn fe and as was calculated using the following equation 2 m c e v f where c e indicates the detected concentration in the elute v and f indicate the elution volume and efficiency respectively wang et al 2017 the content of dgt labile chemicals c dgt was calculated using the following equation zhang et al 1995 3 c dgt m δ g d a t m s δ g d t where δg is the diffusive layer thickness 0 08 cm d is the diffusion coefficient cm2 s 1 wang et al 2016 a is the effective area of the gel strip equaling 0 5 1 8 cm2 and t is the dgt deployment time the measured data were plotted using origin ver 9 software the other figures were plotted using corel draw ver 2018 software significant differences between different samples were analyzed using spss ver 20 0 software with one way anova followed by duncan s multiple range test the significance level was set at p 0 05 linear correlations and multiple regression analyses between different parameters were analyzed and plotted using pearson s correlation and asymptotic analysis in origin ver 2019b 2 6 difs model and interface flux estimation we employed the difs dgt induced fluxes in sediments model which is based on a pair of linked parabolic partial differential equations to simulate the release resupply kinetics from solid sediment to pore water perturbed by dgt following the below equations harper et al 2000 4 r c dgt c d 5 k d c s c d 6 t c 1 k 1 k 1 7 k 1 k 1 k d p c where r is the resupply

resupply in this study dissolved as and p cd detected by hr peeper dgt labile cdgt and solids cs i e the sum of fractions f1 f2 and f3 for as and ex p for p were the major components used to calculate the input parameters harper et al 1998 the particle concentration p c was calculated as the ratio of c s to the pore water volume based on the input parameters this model can simulate the curves of r values with deployment time and calculate the output parameter t c which is the time required for the perturbed system to reach the equilibrium state then the desorption rate constant k 1 and adsorption rate constant k 1 were calculated using eqs 6 and 7 with higher values implying less time to desorb adsorb to from the pore water the interface flux through diffusion transport was estimated based on fick s first law and sediment tortuosity berner 1980 boudreau 1996 8 f φ d s 1 ln φ 2 d c d z where f and φ indicate the exchange flux and sediment porosity respectively φ was calculated based on the moisture content and sediment density d c d z is the concentration gradient for solutes i e drp tdp fe mn and as within surficial pore water top 2 cm and d s is the solute diffusion coefficient in pore water which was calculated from the solute diffusion coefficients in seawater multiplied by φ2 while φ 0 7 li and gregory 1974 ullman and aller 1982 3 results 3 1 properties of overlying water and sediment most of the physical and chemical properties of the overlying water showed the same regularity at the four sampling sites for example the do salinity and ph in the aquaculture ponds were higher than those in the estuarine water table s1 the main reason for this was that the aeration equipment in the ponds constantly exploded the gas leading to higher levels of dissolved oxygen in the water the salinity of the aquaculture pond was higher than that of the estuarine area because saline water can flow into the ponds from the sea during high tides sediment characteristics are more complex than those of the overlying water the particle size results showed that silt was the primary sediment type in both estuarine tidal flats and aquaculture ponds although regional differences were observed fig s1 the sediments at the bottom of the pond had a higher percentage of silt but a lower sand content than the estuarine sediment fig s1 indicating that the pond construction later changed the composition of the original estuarine sediments as shown in fig 2 the chemical characteristics of the sediments differed significantly between the aquaculture ponds and estuarine tidal flats for example the tp exchangeable p ex p fe al oxide bound p fe al p inorganic p ip and organic p op contents in aquaculture ponds are higher than those in estuarine tidal flats indicating a p enriched environment in pond sediments in addition when comparing the two tidal flat sites the closer to the aquaculture pond the higher the phosphorus content indicating that the aquaculture pond was an important p source it was found that aq 1 had a higher p content than aq 2 indicating that tidal creeks can effectively enrich p discharged from aquaculture ponds furthermore the fe al p content peaks at aq 1 accounting for 81 of the ip content total organic carbon toc and total reductive sulfur ts in aquaculture ponds were obviously higher than those in estuarine sediments but exhibited similar amounts of iron oxides fe ox aquaculture ponds are rich in artificial organic matter and p enrichment is prominent there were no significant differences in the spatial distribution of the as content and fractions indicating that there was no anthropogenic as contamination in the aquaculture ponds the residual pattern f4 dominated the as fractions and was higher than the exchangeable and carbonate f1 reducible f2 and oxidizable f3 patterns however the exchangeable and carbonate patterns f1 dominated the mn fractions and were higher in the estuarine tidal flats than in the aquaculture ponds the main reason may be that compared to estuarine tidal flats aquaculture ponds lack terrestrial input and the artificial embankment acts as a barrier making it difficult to import terrestrial suspended particles through the tidal creek furthermore mn is mainly derived from terrestrial inputs and is easily enriched in estuarine sediments trefry and presley 1982 3 2 properties of pore water the depth profiles of the in situ hr pepper derived pore water properties including the concentrations of drp tdp and soluble metal loid s are illustrated in fig 3 overall p in the aquaculture ponds was higher than that in the estuarine sediments which is consistent with the sediment results figs 3 and 4 in the vertical direction most elements showed an increasing trend with depth at all sampling sites for example the drp and tdp showed monotonically increasing trends in the intertidal zone es 1 and aquaculture ponds aq 1 and aq 2 however the drp and tdp in the subtidal zone es 2 showed a fluctuating trend of increasing from the overlying water to the sediment within a depth of 2 cm decreasing from 2 to 8 cm and then increasing again with depth the vertical variation in dop showed great spatial variability at the four sampling sites fig 5 among them es 1 in the intertidal zone and aq 2 in the aquaculture pond gradually increased with depth but showed a zigzag fluctuation in the subtidal zone i e es 2 at aq 1 the dop gradually increased with depth above 7 cm gradually decreased from to 7 12 cm and then gradually stabilized in the horizontal direction the relative proportion of dop was higher in the areas where mangroves grew i e es 1 and aq 1 which was consistent with op indicating that estuarine mangrove sediments were conducive to organophosphorus enrichment the vertical variation of as in pore water showed a gradual increase trend with depths in the estuarine tidal flat es 1 3 2 17 3 mg l 1 es 2 4 7 37 7 mg l 1 but was relatively constant with low variation ranges in aquaculture ponds aq 1 2 0 8 3 mg l 1 aq 2 4 8 11 1 mg l 1 the concentrations of fe and mn at the four sampling sites showed a trend of gradually increased with depth fig 3 in addition the relative variation ranges of fe and mn concentrations were higher in estuarine tidal flats than in aquaculture ponds indicating that fe mn concentrations were greatly affected by tidal hydrology in estuarine tidal flats figs 3 and 4 3 3 properties of dgt labile s p and as the 2d vertical distribution of dgt labile s at various depths displayed significant variations during the transition from estuarine tidal flats to aquaculture ponds fig 6 the dgt labile s in the estuarine sediments was homogenous with a low variation range 0 0 05 mg l 1 in concentrations the low concentrations of dgt labile s at es 1 may have been caused by the deep oxidation zone whereas those at es 2 may have been caused by poor organic matter fig 2 in contrast the concentrations of dgt labile s in the aquaculture pond were significantly higher than those in the estuarine tidal flat and were highly heterogeneous for example the concentrations of dgt labile s were very low at depths of 0 6 cm at aq 1 and then gradually increased with depth in particular the dgt labile s at aq 2 varied by different degrees through the dgt device and increased by a factor of 10 up to 0 2 mg l 1 at a depth of 10 14 cm except for es 2 in the subtidal zone the vertical distribution of dgt labile p likely increases with depth in addition to sediments and pore water the concentrations of dgt labile p in aquaculture ponds were significantly higher than those in the estuarine tidal flats fig 4 we further transformed the two dimensional dgt labile s into a one dimensional vertical distribution and found that the depth zone with a high concentration fig 6 and variation range fig 4 was generally consistent with those of dgt labile p especially in aquaculture ponds the vertical distributions of dgt labile as were nearly consistent with those of soluble as in the pore water figs 3 and 6 the as concentrations were relatively high in the pond sediments but relatively divergent in the estuarine sediments especially at es 2 overall most of the vertical distributions at the four sampling sites showed clear horizontal heterogeneity at certain depths 3 4 p exchange between overlying water and sediments the apparent diffusion fluxes between the pore water and the overlying water were revealed by the positive values 0 04 0 1 mg m 2 d 1 for tdp release to the overlying water but there were large differences for drp and dop fig 7 a the exchange flux of the tdp reached its maximum at aq 1 which connects the aquaculture ponds and the tidal flat in particular the dop diffused from the sediments into the overlying water in the mangrove growing zone i e es 1 and aq 1 with a flux range of 0 05 0 06 mg m 2 d 1 indicating that the mangrove sediment is an important source of organic phosphorus for overlying water in contrast the sediment in the subtidal zone i e es 2 acted as a sink for organophosphorus whereas the dop exchange flux across the sediment water interface at aq 2 was almost negligible in conclusion all four sampling sites showed upward drp exchange from sediments to overlying water with a flux range of 0 05 0 09 mg m 2 d 1 as shown in fig 7b the diffusion fluxes of metal loid s as 0 02 14 75 mg m 2 d 1 mn 0 002 12 6 mg m 2 d 1 fe 0 11 1 33 mg m 2 d 1 reached the maximum at es 2 reducing environment followed by the aquaculture zone oxidizing environment and the minimum at es 1 oxidizing environment compared with es 2 es 1 in the intertidal zone suffered periodic seawater inundation and soil aeration and thus had a higher content of dissolved oxygen the anoxic reduction environment at es 2 was more conducive to the release of as fe mn from sediments into the overlying water 4 discussions 4 1 p mobilization associated with fe mn as s cycling in the pore water profiles the mn concentration was higher than that of fe except at aq 1 indicating that mn reduction contributed more to the mineralization of organic matter canfield et al 1993 the low contents of mn and as in the sediment and the consistent patterns of mn and as in the pore water of the aquaculture ponds figs 2 and 4 indicate that the artificial input of mn and as was insignificant and as release passivation was dominated by mn redox cycling ying et al 2011 however the fe concentration in the tidal creek aq 1 was significantly higher than that of mn which may be ascribed to frequent human dredging of the waterway which is conducive to the reduction and reoxidation of iron oxides chen et al 2018 dgt s is enriched at deep depths in aquaculture ponds featuring more organic matter to favor sulfate reduction and produce more sulfide lovley and phillips 1987 in addition dgt labile as was significantly reduced under sulfidic conditions which may be ascribed to the co precipitation or organic complexation of as and sulfur forming an iron arsenic sulfur complex leading to the passivation of as kirk et al 2004 overall the distributions of dissolved fe mn and dgt labile s indicated a complex competitive relationship between their redox cycling that is mn cycling dominated in estuarine sediments and fe and s cycling dominated in pond sediments the chemical characteristics of p in the sediments were significantly different between the aquaculture ponds and estuarine tidal flats for example the spatial distributions of the tp and p fractions including ex p fe al p ip and op were higher in pond sediments than in estuarine sediments fig 2 indicating that the construction of aquaculture ponds tends to enrich p in sediments which may be attributed to anthropogenic pollution ebeling et al 2006 in addition the relative proportion of dop to tp dop in pore water was higher in areas where mangroves grew i e es 1 and aq 1 which was consistent with op indicating that estuarine mangrove sediments were beneficial for organophosphorus enrichment you et al 2022 in pore water profiles except for site es 2 dop concentrations fluctuated and tended to increase at deeper depths fig 5 showing that dop was decomposed and mobilized under anoxic conditions this is similar to the drp verified in a previous study cermelj et al 1997 nevertheless the high dop values appearing at subsurface depths 4 8 cm were clearly inconsistent with those of drp and tdp indicating different activation mechanisms between drp and dop furthermore both dop concentrations and dop were inconsistent with dissolved fe mn and dgt labile s in the depth profiles confirming that the activation of dop was not controlled by the redox cycling of fe mn and s for lateral variation at the four sites the profile averaged dop concentration mainly depended on the sediment p content especially op and ex p figs 8 and s2 which has been verified in a previous study monbet et al 2010 accordingly the low dop concentrations and dop were attributed to the poor sediment p content in the bare mudflat generally the local mobilization and enrichment of dop in pore water profile 0 3 mg l 1 and 50 tdp demonstrated that dop is an important component of the p cycle and can be regarded as a quantitatively significant p fraction in pore water monbet et al 2009 unlike dop drp concentration showed increasing trend with less fluctuation in pore water profiles fig 3 which was highly consistent with tdp since drp accounted most for tdp 81 4 7 9 on average although drp and tdp showed good correlation and synchronous trends with dissolved fe and mn in the four profiles figs 3 and 8 as well as more intense mn reduction the adsorption release of p was mainly controlled by fe cycling rather than mn the reason for this was the better correlation between drp tdp and fe but not mn for the profile averaged values at the four sites fig s2 in particular aq 1 had the highest fe and drp tdp and the lowest mn concentrations whereas es 2 had the highest mn and lowest drp tdp concentrations this verified the mechanism of fe redox controlled p release adsorption in sediments proposed by pan et al 2019b who investigated the fe s p biogeochemistry in tidal flat sediments near our sampling sites this also explains the low drp tdp concentrations in estuarine sediments as fe reduction was weak in pond sediments dgt labile s was positively correlated with dgt labile p drp and tdp indicating that sulfate reduction may activate p release probably via op mineralization and or fe p remobilization pan et al 2020 overall drp or tdp activation was controlled by fe cycling in the estuarine sediments and by both fe and s cycling in the pond sediments 4 2 p kinetic resupply evaluated by the difs model the kinetic resupply of p from sediment to pore water was evaluated using the difs model the values of the input and output parameters modeled by the difs for drp tdp and as in the surface sediments are summarized in table 1 we found that traditionally using drp as the phosphorus concentration in pore water is inaccurate through the difs simulation model using drp and tdp as proxies for the p concentration in pore water it was found that the difs simulated r curves i e the kinetic resupply ability of p from sediments to pore water were significantly different fig 9 a and b r values decreased especially in mangrove growing areas where organophosphorus was relatively abundant furthermore except for es 2 the estimated r values using drp were stable when they increased to a high value whereas the estimated r values using tdp increased to the same high value but then continuously decreased indicating that the resupply capacity continuously decreased pan et al 2019a this indicates that previous studies that used only drp as a proxy for pore water p concentration to model and evaluate the kinetics of p adsorption and desorption between sediment and pore water were unreasonable for as the continuous decrease in r values indicated that the resupply capacity decreased over time suggesting that the risk of arsenic activation release from the sediments was negligible in the study sites the relative values of the model output parameters t c response time k1 sorption rate and k 1 desorption rate were consistent with r values the higher the r value the smaller the tc but the larger k1 and k 1 that is the faster the adsorption desorption and equilibrium rates the stronger the resupply capacity from sediment to pore water harper et al 1998 2000 this will lead to the typical results during the establishment of the initial time diffusion equilibrium r value remained stable after reaching the peak and only slowly decreased to equilibrium with time e g drp in four sampling sites and tdp at aq 2 and es 2 r 0 38 in contrast the lower r value the larger t c and the smaller k1 and k 1 indicating that the adsorption desorption rate and equilibrium rate were slower and the resupply ability from sediment to pore water was weaker wu et al 2016 this resulted in a peak value of r during the establishment of the initial time diffusion equilibrium followed by a significant decrease e g as in four sampling sites and tdp at aq 1 and es 1 r 0 3 compared with drp it can be found that tdp had larger t c and smaller k1 and k 1 in most sampling points except es 2 which means that the resupply ability was weakened in other words the difs simulation with drp as a proxy for pore water p concentration overestimated the ability of the sediment to resupply pore water p during dgt placement compared with the drp and tdp the adsorption desorption and equilibrium rates of as were slower and the resupply ability from sediment to pore water was weaker in addition owing to the adsorption of as in the pore water by the dgt the resupply capacity also decreased with time fig 9c which further proved that the pollution risk of as activation and release was very low in the study sites 4 3 interface p source sink pattern although p is an essential element for marine organisms it generally has low concentrations in coastal environments and p limitation has been widely observed in oligotrophic oceans and coastal seas wu et al 2000 krom et al 2004 however owing to increasing anthropogenic activities such as the establishment of aquaculture ponds rahman et al 2013 ren et al 2019 p concentration has increased sharply causing marine eutrophication and hypoxic or oxygen depletion conditions diaz and rosenberg 2008 thus the p source sink pattern in aquaculture ponds may regulate the nutrient budget and primary production in coastal oceans benitez nelson 2000 paytan and mclaughlin 2007 in this study we comparatively explored the exchange flux of p across the sediment water interface in estuarine tidal flats and aquaculture ponds and found that sediment was mostly the source of p for the overlying water fig 7 only at the intertidal es 1 and subtidal es 2 the sediments were slight sinks of drp and dop respectively in addition although the p concentrations in both the sediment and pore water of the aquaculture ponds were much higher than those in the tidal flat figs 2 and 4 the p flux from the sediment to the overlying water was not higher than that of the tidal flat a possible reason for this is that continuous artificial feeding in the ponds caused the concentration gradient of p between the sediment and overlying water to be relatively small that is a quasi equilibrium state may have been reached in addition the sediments in the mangrove growing area i e es 1 and aq 1 were sources of dop fig 6 which was consistent with the higher organophosphorus concentrations in the sediments fig 2 furthermore we compared the exchange fluxes of p including drp dop and tdp across the sediment water interface among different aquatic systems including aquaculture ponds seabeds salt marshes and mangroves table 2 the comparison showed that our results were well within the ranges estimated in other studies for example wang et al 2011 found the diffusive flux of tdp ranged from 0 003 to 0 93 mg m 2 d 1 which was close to our flux estimations both in mangrove tidal flat and aquaculture ponds however the exchange fluxes of p at most of the other sites were significantly larger than our estimations for example in the fish ponds of spain morata et al 2012 and france lefebvre et al 2001 the diffusional fluxes of tdp were as high as 30 30 and 431 10 mg m 2 d 1 respectively the tdp flux ranges were also as high as 9 9 and 27 5 mg m 2 d 1 in canada burt et al 2013 and poland łukawska matuszewska and burska 2011 respectively the exchange fluxes in the shrimp and shellfish ponds were significantly lower in vietnam china and france table 2 in summary although the p exchange fluxes in shrimp ponds and coastal wetlands were relatively small they are still an unignored p source for the surrounding coastal waters because of their worldwide distribution and anthropogenic internal p enrichment 4 4 environmental implications the c p ratio indicates p enrichment and or the potential limitation of p in biotic communities cleveland and liptzin 2007 we further estimated the organic c p molar ratios in the sediments which were ranked as aq 1 60 0 es 1 93 1 es 2 84 8 aq 2 168 5 this indicates that the mangrove sediments i e es 1 and aq 1 tended to be more organic p enriched than the subtidal zone at es 2 and the aquaculture pond at aq 2 where p is increasingly decoupled from c but may be regulated by an inorganic mineral p retention mechanism reddy et al 1999 in addition soil organic matter and plant detritus normally function as major storage pools of organic p reddy et al 1999 furthermore p storage is mediated through direct p assimilation by microbes and algae that colonize detrital plant tissues in the water column and sediment surface reddy et al 2011 although the p flux released from the sediment in the aquaculture ponds was not larger than that in the estuarine tidal flat the p concentrations in both the sediment and pore water in the aquaculture ponds were much greater than those in the tidal flat this suggests that aquaculture ponds are a potential source of p pollution in estuarine surface waters because changes in the breeding pattern in the ponds or external weather conditions such as rainfall will likely increase the p concentration gradient between the sediment and overlying water and further p release in addition as we found many exposed clastic bedrocks near the bank embankment in the field the base of the whole bank embankment can be regarded as a relatively permeable aquifer thus as schematically shown in fig 10 there is likely a large exchange of groundwater and solutes associated with submarine groundwater discharge i e sgd moore 1996 between the estuarine tidal flats and aquaculture ponds for example we found that in subtidal zone es 2 which was near the low tide line drp and tdp first increased from the overlying water to a 2 cm depth of sediment then decreased from 2 cm to 8 cm and then increased again with depth fig 3 this may be caused by seepage flow or lateral subsurface groundwater flow from aquaculture ponds to the tidal flat because the area close to the low tide line tended to be the site of the largest sgd excretion rate across the sediment water interface e g gardner 2005 wilson and gardner 2006 xiao et al 2019 recent studies have shown that aquaculture in coastal shrimp ponds may increase the flux of submarine groundwater discharge hou et al 2022 however the specific amount of p flux discharged from aquaculture ponds into the estuary through sgd needs to be further determined by hydrochemical monitoring and numerical simulation in the future but it is of great research significance last but not the least our research results emphasized that the construction of aquaculture ponds has changed the p cycling mechanism and the interface source sink process however the study was conducted in a local area over a limited time period further work is required at more study sites particularly those covering different latitudes aquaculture types and wetland types we suggest that p mobilization and kinetic resupply in aquaculture ponds are sensitive to temporal variability at short diurnal middle initial middle and late feeding stages and long seasonal timescales further research on adjusting feeding strategies and preventing internal p loading will aid in management decisions supporting the sustainability of both pond construction and the restoration of estuarine wetlands for optimal p removal especially in the context of rapid global changes and expanding marine aquaculture 5 conclusions this study provides early insights into the differences in phosphorus cycling including p composition redox mobilization kinetic resupply and source sink processes across the sediment water interface caused by the conversion of estuarine mangrove wetlands to shrimp ponds the combination of conventional sediment analysis high resolution dialysis hr peeper and dgt technology was verified as a robust methodology for synchronously determining dissolved fe mn as and p concentrations in pore water and dgt labile s in sediment to explore the kinetic mechanism of p remobilization in aquaculture ponds and estuarine tidal flats and their benthic exchange fluxes we conclude that the aquaculture pond was rich in artificial organic matter and dgt labile s and phosphorus enrichment was prominent the mn concentration in the pore water was higher than that of iron indicating that mn contributed more than iron to the reduced mineralization of organic matter the vertical distributions were roughly similar between fe and p and between mn and as indicating that p release adsorption was controlled by fe redox in the sediments but as release and passivation were dominated by mn redox cycling furthermore significant correlations were found between p content and metal loid and sulfide content demonstrating that the availability and mobilization of p were driven by complex fe mn as s cycling in particular the relative proportions of dop to tp and the diffusion fluxes were higher in areas where mangroves grew indicating that mangrove sediments were conducive to organophosphorus enrichment overall these clear distinctions in p mobilization and kinetic resupply between anthropogenic aquaculture ponds and natural estuarine mangroves are critical for quantifying p source sink processes thus curbing water eutrophication and the effective management of tidal flats in the jiulong river estuary and other

14938,understanding the interactions between phosphate p and mineral adsorbents is critical for removing and recovering p from wastewater especially in the presence of both cationic and organic components to this end we investigated the surface interactions of p with an iron titanium coprecipitated oxide composite in the presence of ca 0 5 3 0 mm and acetate 1 5 mm and quantified the molecular complexes and tested the possible removal and recovery of p from real wastewater a quantitative analysis of p k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes confirmed the inner sphere surface complexation of p with both fe and ti whose contribution to p adsorption relies on their surface charge determined by ph conditions the effects of ca and acetate on p removal were highly ph

influence on p removal capacity and molecular mechanisms at ph 7 at ph 4 the removal amount of p was not obviously affected by the presence of ca and acetate however acetate and high ca concentration jointly facilitated the formation of amorphous fepo4 precipitate complicating the interactions of p with fe ti composite in comparison with ferrihydrite the fe ti composite significantly decreased the formation of amorphous fepo4 probably by decreasing fe dissolution due to the coprecipitated ti component facilitating further p recovery an understanding of these microscopic mechanisms can lead to the successful use and simple regeneration of the adsorbent to recover p from real wastewater keywords phosphorus removal bimetal oxide composite surface complexation and precipitation ternary complexes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large amounts of phosphate p in wastewater often cause eutrophication in the receiving surface waters because p is a non regenerable and limited resource on earth it is necessary to recover p from wastewater effluents particularly from the perspective of a circular economy an adsorptive strategy using a metal oxide based adsorbent is commonly used to remove p from wastewater because of its low cost easy operability high removal efficiency and reusability sonoda et al 2020 kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 the removal efficiency and recovery of p are often affected by wastewater components that include large amounts of ca and organic components previous studies employed various metal oxides as adsorbents and demonstrated that high concentrations of ca often increase the adsorption efficiency of negatively charged anions such as p and as hu et al 2015 talebi atouei et al 2016 this is probably due to the presence of additional electrostatic forces surface ternary complexation and or surface precipitation zhang et al 2019 it has been suggested that some ternary surface complexes of ca with adsorbed p ca p mineral form on goethite gao and mucci 2003 ferrihydrite antelo et al 2015 mendez and hiemstra 2020 and hydrous zirconium oxide over a ph range of 6 9 lin et al 2017 furthermore precipitates such as hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 hap were observed on the surface of boehmite from ph 7 to 9 li et al 2012 in addition to cahpo4 on hydrous zirconium oxides lin et al 2017 and amorphous ca3 po4 2 on lanthanum hydroxide at ph 9 fang et al 2017 although these p ca ternary complexes or precipitates have been widely observed their presence at circumneutral or alkaline ph clearly influences the process of desorbing and regenerating p using the suggested naoh solution suresh kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 but this was not clearly demonstrated in the case of complicated real wastewater high concentrations of organic acids in wastewater may compete with p for adsorption sites shi et al 2010 acetic acid one of the most abundant components 30 0 83 5 mg l in wastewater chen et al 2004 tong and chen 2009 was shown to often interact with the adsorption sites on iron fe oxides and promotes fe dissolution spalla and kékicheff 1997 and a high concentration of oxalic acid in simulated wastewater decreased the removal of p on ca rich solid waste by 50 drapanauskaite et al 2021 it was reported that citrate and acetate inhibited p adsorption on goethite geelhoed et al 1998 shi et al 2010 furthermore the presence of organic acids may influence the interaction between ca and adsorbed p on metal oxides although such information remains unclear therefore it is necessary to investigate the synergistic reactions of coexisting ca and organic acids mixtures with p and their impact on the removal and recovery of p from wastewater recently to increase the sorption capacity of p various fe based bimetal oxide materials have been synthesized including fe al khare et al 2005 liu and hesterberg 2011 fe mn zhang et al 2009 fe zr zhang et al 2017 fe la wu et al 2017 and fe ti d arcy et al 2011 lu et al 2015 these bimetal oxide adsorbents can enhance the removal of p by utilizing a more amorphous or porous structure with a higher density of hydroxyl adsorption sites on their surface introduced by the coprecipitated metal liu and hesterberg 2011 zhang et al 2017 titanium based materials are nontoxic and highly stable under acidic and basic conditions and were widely used for remediating pollutants including p wang et al 2017a and its analogues such as arsenic yan et al 2016 the coprecipitated metal oxide critically influenced p adsorption mechanism s a role that has been overlooked liu and hesterberg 2011 particularly in wastewater with atypical composition last the possible dissolution of fe from fe based bimetal oxide in the presence of both ca and organic chemicals was not confirmed in previous studies and it may influence the interfacial complexation of p on mineral surfaces and further the reusability of adsorbents in this study we synthesized a typical ti and fe coprecipitated bimetal oxide adsorbent fe ti composite for p removal and recovery in simulated water and actual wastewater and focused on the synergistic impact of ca and acetate the specific enhancing role of ti was elucidated and the macroscopic and molecular level mechanism s of p in the presence of ca and acetate were investigated we aimed to elucidate the possible surface complexation or precipitation between ca acetate and p on the bimetal oxide umder different ph values using synchrotron based x ray absorption near edge structure xanes techniques and finally provide an easy regeneration process for p removal and recovery from realistic wastewater using fe ti composite 2 materials and experiments 2 1 chemicals and preparation of ti coprecipitated fe composite bimetal oxides stock solutions were prepared with reagent grade k2hpo4 nacl cacl2 and ch3coona a stock solution of 1000 mg p l was prepared by dissolving k2hpo4 in di water storing it at 4 c and using it within two weeks the ti coprecipitated fe composite bimetal oxide fe ti composite was synthesized using 6 16 g fe no3 3 9h2o and 1 49 g of tioso4 molar ratio of fe ti at 4 in 1 0 l di water and adjusting the ph to 7 0 using 5 m naoh washed filtered and freeze dried to obtain the final fe ti composite adsorbent for comparison ferrihydrite and tio2 were synthesized according to previous studies luo et al 2010 mendez and hiemstra 2020 2 2 batch adsorption experiments kinetic experiments were performed by reacting 2 mm p with 0 8 g l of fe ti composite in 0 04 m nacl solution to simulate surface water the experiments were performed for 24 h at ph 7 0 and 4 0 with sampling at designated time intervals the two ph values were selected considering ph variations in various wastewater or acidogenesis effluents li and li 2017 olabode et al 2020 yu and fang 2002 isotherm experiments were conducted by transferring working solution into sets of tubes containing 0 8 g l of fe ti composite and increasing concentrations of p 0 13 mm with 0 04 m nacl at ph 7 or 4 adsorption edge experiments were investigated to determine the percentage of p adsorbed as a function of the final equilibrium ph of the suspension the effect of ionic strength on p adsorption was tested in solutions with different nacl concentrations 0 04 0 4 mol l which represent typical matrices of natural waters and wastewater ajmal et al 2018 lǚ et al 2013 and usually show negligible influence on the inner sphere adsorption structure of p on adsorbent material antelo et al 2005 mallet et al 2013 the designed ph was maintained during all the adsorption experiment using dilute naoh and hcl to study the effect of ca and acetate suspensions containing 2 mm p or blends of 2 mm p with 0 5 3 mm ca and 1 5 mm acetate were mixed and adjusted to ph 4 or 7 representing the chemistry variations in wastewater the mixing suspensions were supplemented with 0 8 g l fe ti composite kept at ph 4 or 7 and rotated for 24 h like that in p adsorption experiment furthermore the possible formation of the ca p precipitate was investigated by changing the sequential addition of ca 3 mm and p 2 mm to ferrihydrite with 0 04 m nacl at ph 7 with experimental details shown in the supplementary material the experimental concentrations of p and ca were selected to prevent their possible precipitation in solution according to a calculation using visual minteq the possible removal and recovery of p using the fe ti composite material 0 3 g l was further tested using wastewater samples 4 55 0 28 mg p l 27 8 1 6 mg ca l 900 49 mg so4 2 l 273 14 mg hco3 l 277 16 mg cl l 534 14 mg toc l ph 5 2 mainly derived from the fermentation of food waste in comparison with synthetic water a smaller amount of fe ti composite 0 3 g l was used which was sufficient for p removal from wastewater the ph of the wastewater was adjusted to 5 similar to that of raw wastewater or 7 for possible enhanced p removal the reusability of adsorbent was tested by five adsorption regeneration reuse cycles the p desorption process for adsorbent regeneration was optimized using different concentrations 0 1 m 0 5 m or 1 0 m of naoh before naoh treatment dilute hcl 0 05 m and 0 1 m was tested to dissolve the ca p precipitate if present sonoda et al 2020 all of the above batch samples were mixed on a rotator for 24 h centrifuged and filtered 0 45 μm before further analysis 2 3 characterization and analysis the concentration of p in solution was determined using the molybdenum blue spectrophotometric method with a uv vis spectrophotometer spectra uv 11 mrc germany at 880 nm the possible dissolution of fe from the material was confirmed by fe analysis of the solution sample using icp ms agilent 8800 characterization experiment included bet surface area analysis x ray powder diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy points of zero charge phpzc and scanning electron microscopy sem the xanes at the p k edge was performed at the tls 16a1 beamline in the national synchrotron radiation research center nsrrc in taiwan following our previous procedures cui et al 2022 li et al 2020 details are shown in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the morphological structure and surface element analysis of fe oxide ferrihydrite titanium oxide tio2 and the fe ti composite were shown in fig s1 s2 the as synthesized fe ti composite material showed coarse surfaces similar to those of pure fe oxide and ti oxide as identified by the sem edx analysis while fe and ti showed similar distributions in the fabricated material the xrd results fig s3 for the fe ti composite contained two broad diffraction peaks at angles 2θ of 34 and 61 showing that ferrihydrite was the major constituent jia et al 2006 similar to the characteristic of pure fe oxide no obvious tio2 phase was observed in the fe ti composite probably because of the high content of fe component lu et al 2015 the bet surface area of ferrihydrite was 260 m2 g which was consistent with the previously reported range of 229 427 m2 g antelo et al 2015 cerkez et al 2015 wang et al 2013 the surface area of fe ti composite was as large as 384 m2 g which was much higher than the previously reported 32 9 133 5 m2 g of the nanostructured fe ti adsorbents d arcy et al 2011 lu et al 2015 probably due to the use of the free drying process at low temperature in the present study wang et al 2013 in comparison with ferrihydrite and tio2 the fe ti bimetal oxide showed less negative charge on the surface at ph 6 fig s4 and may enhance the adsorption of negatively charged p compared with the pure metal oxide antelo et al 2005 suresh kumar et al 2018 the electronic structure of the fe ti composite was analyzed using xps fig 1a b and c in ferrihydrite the binding energies were 710 9 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 5 ev fe 2p1 2 for the fe 2p spectra which shifted up to 711 1 ev and 724 7 ev in the fe ti composite consistently the ti 2p spectra shifted down from 458 9 ev and 464 7 ev in tio2 to 458 6 ev and 464 4 ev in the fe ti composite these synergistic shifts indicated the withdrawing of electrons from fe3 and moving of electrons to ti4 therefore the formation of a composite structure of fe o ti with more hydroxyl groups in the fe ti coprecipitate was proposed which can probably lead to more adsorbate adsorption mallet et al 2013 yu et al 2019 the calculated relative amount of hydroxyl groups m oh in the fe ti composite 32 8 was similar to that for ferrihydrite 32 4 and greater than that for tio2 15 8 showing that the major fe component in the fe ti composite made a major contribution to adsorption accordingly the oh groups observed in the fe ti composite from the ftir analysis showed significant peaks at 988 1056 and 1123 cm 1 fig 1d similar to ferrihydrite wang et al 2017b and fe mn binary oxide zhang et al 2007 the broad peaks at 480 600 and 690 cm 1 may be attributed to bulk oh deformation bands in the fe ti material wang et al 2017b the coupling of changes in the binding energies of fe and ti surface charge and surface area of the fe ti composite compared with ferrihydrite and tio2 revealed that the composite was not a simple physical mixture of ti and fe oxides zhang et al 2005 3 2 batch adsorption the removal of p was rapid during the first hour and then gradually slowed after five hours when it began to reach saturation fig 2a the kinetic data were accurately described using a pseudo second order kinetics model jing et al 2012 phosphate adsorption decreased significantly at a higher ph e g from 1 27 mmol g at ph 4 to 0 85 mmol g at ph 7 while the adsorption rate was much higher at ph 7 5 9396 g mmol h than at ph 4 2 9791 g mmol h fig 2a similar results for the effect of ph on p removal were observed in previous studies on ferrihydrite mallet et al 2013 wang et al 2017b goethite geelhoed et al 1998 and other composite materials lu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 the effect of ph on p adsorptive removal was shown in fig s5 at ph 2 70 of p was removed while 40 was removed at ph 6 and 20 at ph 10 consistent with the typical behavior of oxyanion adsorption on minerals antelo et al 2005 at a ph range lower than 5 2 the fe ti surface showed a positive charge fig s4 which favored the adsorption of negatively charged forms of p including h2po4 and hpo4 2 lu et al 2015 with increasing ph negative charge began to accumulate on the mineral surface of the fe ti oxide which would gradually limit the adsorption of p furthermore the adsorption energy of the major species of h2po4 at acidic ph was less than that of hpo4 2 and po4 3 kubicki et al 2007 confirming the thermodynamically favorable adsorption of p at low ph range the capacity of fe ti composite for p removal at ph 4 and ph 7 was investigated using an isothermal adsorption experiment fig 2b langmuir modeling results showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 2 05 mmol p g at ph 4 38 higher than 1 36 mmol p g at ph 7 the synthesized material showed a relatively high removal capacity for p in comparison with other fe based metal oxide adsorbents exhibiting 0 05 1 69 median of 0 44 mmol p g at ph 4 5 and 0 02 2 15 median of 1 00 mmol p g at ph 6 7 as summarized in table s1 interestingly the synthesized fe ti composite showed a higher capacity than a previous nanostructured fe ti bimetal oxide adsorbent 1 01 1 18 mmol p g at ph 6 8 d arcy et al 2011 lu et al 2015 the higher surface area of as synthesized fe ti composite provided more availability to the reactive hydroxyl reactive sites on the surface of particles hence leading to increased adsorption ability gypser et al 2018 exploration of the controlling factors on comparative p adsorption capacity by various fe based adsorbent materials presents interesting results table s1 the reported adsorption capacities were estimated by langmuir modeling of isotherm experiment which is performed by a series of p concentrations when the available adsorption sites are sufficiently occupied by p therefore this isotherm estimated adsorption capacity is not only crucially governed by initial p concentration but also affected by various other parameters including adsorption sites ph specific surface area etc the amount of available adsorption sites i e hydroxyl groups should be the theoretical maximum limit for p binding on adsorbent liu et al 2021 wang et al 2013 zeng et al 2008 because ph plays a crucial role in p adsorption the reported adsorption capacities were further divided into two groups including ph 4 5 and ph 6 7 and normalized by adsorbent dosage as shown in fig s6 the comparative results showed that with increasing bet surface area distinctively different p adsorption behaviors were observed at different ph ranges at ph 4 5 p adsorption capacity linearly increased with increasing surface area fig s6a while no obvious relationship was observed at ph 6 7 fig s6b these previously published data of p adsorption capacity from various fe based metal oxides collectively demonstrated that at acidic ph high surface area largely facilitated p removal allowing rapid transport of negatively charged p from solution to positive surface reactive sites through internal pores due to electrostatic attraction lǚ et al 2013 zeng et al 2008 when the availability of surface binding sites of materials was enhanced liu et al 2021 wang et al 2013 in contrast at neutral ph of 6 7 the amount of p adsorption is largely inhibited by the repulsion of both negatively charged p and binding sites lǚ et al 2013 in this neutral condition the impact of specific surface area plays a much less role in p adsorption than ph because these materials and experimental conditions were much different table s1 the critical parameters determining the scattered distribution of p adsorption capacities at neural ph remain unclear which may be explored in future work the influences of ionic strength on p adsorption were determined using increasing concentrations of nacl from 0 04 m to 0 40 m to simulate surface water and saline wastewater an important condition in hong kong there was no significant influence of ionic strength on p adsorption over the ph range 2 10 fig s5 this result was consistent with the adsorption of p on ferrihydrite mallet et al 2013 tio2 kang et al 2011 goethite antelo et al 2005 and fe mn binary oxides zhang et al 2009 slightly higher removal percentages 2 8 of p were observed for higher ionic strengths 0 10 m and 0 40 m nacl in comparison with 0 04 m nacl at a circumneutral ph ph 6 increasing ionic strength often facilitates inner sphere adsorption by decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between the charged mineral surface and p antelo et al 2005 wu et al 2017 at ph 4 ca showed no pronounced effect but slightly decreased p removal 5 6 fig 3 which was consistent with the results of previous studies lin et al 2017 talebi atouei et al 2016 at ph 7 the addition of 0 5 mm ca slightly increased p adsorption from 0 90 to 1 02 mmol g 13 and a further 3 mm ca supplementation significantly p 0 01 increased p removal to 1 17 mmol g 30 fig 3 the ph dependent effect of ca on p adsorption was similar to that of interactions between ca and arsenate antelo et al 2015 hu et al 2015 yan et al 2016 in solutions with the same concentrations of p and ca without the adsorbent at ph 7 no precipitate of p with ca formed as determined by a visual minteq chemical calculation main forms of p h2po4 and hpo4 2 therefore the outer sphere adsorption of positively charged ca ph 7 antelo et al 2015 talebi atouei et al 2016 formed a complex with the negatively charged adsorbed p on mineral surfaces which was probably promoted by electrostatic attraction lin et al 2017 favoring more p removal recent studies revealed that various organic acids including acetate are present with p in wastewater and have a competitive effect on p removal chen et al 2004 zhang et al 2021 therefore one of the most prevalent organic chemicals acetate was selected and its effect on p removal was evaluated the results fig 3 indicated that p removal was slightly increased by 5 mm acetate supplementation together with ca at ph 7 while 1 mm acetate compromised the slightly negative role of ca at ph 4 acetic acid represents one of the key carboxylic groups in humic acid which generally exhibits a limited effect on p adsorption by ferrihydrite and goethite borggaard et al 2005 further molecular evidence explaining the synergistic influence from acetate and ca on p removal on the fe ti composite was investigated in the following sections 3 3 molecular mechanism of p removal by the fe ti composite in the high resolution xps spectra of oxygen the position at 531 5 ev fig 1c table s2 is usually attributed to the oh group mallet et al 2013 yu et al 2019 which is considered to contribute to p adsorption nevertheless the peak intensity of the oh group from the o 1 s high resolution xps spectra showed no decrease after p adsorption a previous study demonstrated that the binding energy level of o p in the fepo4 2h2o compound was close to that of the oh in ferrihydrite mallet et al 2013 thereafter the possible occurrence of fe ti o p bonding after adsorption luengo et al 2006 may show a new peak after p adsorption at the similar position to that of oh group resulting in no obvious change of the peak intensity of oh group further ftir analysis fig 1d showed the presence of the oh group on the fe ti composite through bending vibration at 1123 1056 and 988 cm 1 zhang et al 2009 and deformation band at 700 cm 1 wang et al 2017b the ftir band intensities of the oh group decreased after p adsorption demonstrating that the oh group was involved in p adsorption wang et al 2017b the peaks at 1096 cm 1 were assigned to the adsorbed po4 3 group and the peak at 1020 cm 1 belonged to the stretching mode of p o fe ti similar to the adsorption products of p by ferrihydrite arai and sparks 2001 the observed ftir peaks revealed the formation of an inner sphere complex of the adsorbed p on the surface of the fe ti composite arai and sparks 2001 the spectral features of xanes are sensitive to the molecular coordination of p as shown in standard references fig s7 several spectral features can be identified such as the pre edge feature peak a for p associated with fe or ti oxide and a prominent peak peak b 2154 2 ev for the inorganic p valence state the pre edge feature peak a belonging to the adsorbed p was not observed for the ca associated phosphate species including hydroxyapatite brushite cahpo4 2h2o and ca hpo4 2 the p ca complex or precipitate exhibited a clear difference with a feature peak at 2153 5 ev peak b and a post edge peak c while peak d represented the crystalline degree and a wide broad peak peak e represented the oxygen oscillation ingall et al 2011 prietzel et al 2016 the p adsorbed samples showed a primary peak at approximately 2154 1 ev peak b fig 4 consistent with the dominance of the inorganic p valence state the pre edge feature peak a indicated that p was adsorbed on the fe ti composite via inner sphere surface complexation with a metal element fe or ti the feature peaks of the adsorbed p on the fe ti composite showed no difference at ph 4 and 7 fig 4 because the adsorbed p primarily formed bidentate binuclear structures on metal oxides independent of the ph prietzel et al 2016 tian et al 2017 the intensity and shape of the pre edge feature peak a for p adsorbed on ferrihydrite and tio2 differed figs 4 and s7 therefore the exact contribution of each composite in the fe ti composite for p removal could be deciphered the linear combination fitting lcf analysis of the xanes spectra showed that the fe component in the fe ti composite contributed greatly to p adsorption reaching 80 at ph 4 and 96 at ph 7 fig 5 and table s4 correspondingly the ti component contributed to 15 at ph 4 and 4 at ph 7 with a small percentage of fepo4 5 the contribution of the ti component at ph 4 was generally consistent with its molar percentage 19 the charge of tio2 at ph 7 was more negative than that of ferrihydrite fig s4 which contributed to higher repulsion between the negatively charged p and surface negative hydroxyl groups on tio2 similar to the higher sorption capacity of arsenate observed on goethite than tio2 at circumneutral ph nair et al 2014 the result of comparison between tio2 and ferrihydrite may contribute to the ph dependent performance of the ti component for p adsorption in the fe ti composite iron solubility from minerals often affects p removal capacity wang et al 2017b for our experimental conditions a small amount of dissolved fe was observed during p removal 27 9 12 5 μg l at ph 4 and 12 3 1 2 μg l at ph 7 an amorphous p fe precipitate such as amfepo4 could somewhat reflect the interaction of p with dissolved fe on fe based minerals a p xanes analysis showed a possible formation of an amorphous p fe precipitate as amfepo4 reaching 5 at ph 4 table s4 similar to the detection limit of xanes foster and kim 2014 the formation of the fe p precipitate was caused by the association of adsorbed p with dissolved fe from ferrihydrite dissolution at low ph 3 5 particularly when the sequestrated p exceeded the limit of 0 92 mmol p g wang et al 2017b 3 4 influencing mechanism of ca and acetate on p removal the ph dependent effect of ca on p removal indicates that some reactions between p and ca occurred on the surface of minerals particularly at ph 7 the solid phase of the fe ti adsorbent with p and ca at a circumneutral ph was further characterized as identified by the sem analysis figure s1 p removal had no significant influence on the morphology of the fe ti composite the simultaneous presence of 0 3 mm ca showed small particles on the surface and further addition of ca to 3 mm resulted in more plate shaped particles an sem image and an edx mapping analysis at several points on the newly formed particles showed significant amounts of p and ca fig s8 s13 table s3 these heterogeneous sized particles suggested that p ca precipitates formed due to the gradual reaction of locally concentrated ca with the surface adsorbed p on fe ti wang et al 2015 a crystalline p ca species of hydroxyapatite was identified during the removal of p with 3 mm ca fig s4 according to a standard reference jcpds 09 0432 ikeda 2000 the results suggested that hydroxyapatite precipitate formed under a high concentration of ca this was confirmed by the ftir results fig 1d showing significant peaks at 562 and 1034 cm 1 which were attributed to the bending mode of the po4 3 group in hydroxyapatite berzina cimdina and borodajenko 2012 jastrzębski et al 2011 quantitative information on the p ca precipitate in the synergistic presence of p and ca at different molar ratios was further investigated using xanes techniques andersson et al 2016 quantitative lcf results for xanes figs 4 5 and table s4 identified that when ca was supplemented a new p ca precipitate of hydroxyapatite was formed and was significantly increased from 14 0 5 mm ca to 26 3 mm ca therefore the surface precipitate of hydroxyapatite contributed to an increase in p removal in the presence of ca at ph 7 the positive effect of ca on the p removal at neutral ph was reported for other minerals such as ferrihydrite antelo et al 2015 goethite gao and mucci 2003 talebi atouei et al 2016 hydrous zirconium oxide lin et al 2017 and lanthanum hydroxides fang et al 2017 where different complexes between ca and p formed for example two small characteristic peaks for hydroxyapatite were observed at ph 7 on boehmite from xrd patterns li et al 2012 a previous study observed the formation of brushite at ph 6 5 on degussa p25 tio2 surfaces ronson and mcquillan 2002 however the exact interfacial precipitation process of ca p was not well understood no observed impact from ca on p adsorption at ph 4 fig 3 is caused by the ready solubility of ca p precipitate and the little amount of ca adsorption as a result of both positively charged ca and mineral surface at acidic ph changing the addition sequence of ca and p and using the separated adsorbed solid from the dissolved fraction may help us to further understand details of the interfacial interaction process in addition ferrihydrite was used to exclude the influence of the coprecipitated ti component in the fe ti composite phosphate was first adsorbed on ferrihydrite slurry pre adsorbed p at ph 7 and then the supernatant was discarded and washed before the addition of soluble ca which resulted in an observation of ca p precipitate 5 9 spectra d and e fig s14 and table s4 controversially adding soluble p to the ferrihydrite slurry with pre adsorbed ca resulted in no such precipitate 1 spectra f and g when both p and ca were present in a ferrihydrite suspension at ph 7 a large quantity of p ca precipitate such as hydroxyapatite accounted for 24 33 of the solid product similar to the fe ti composite a previous study demonstrated that pre adsorbed ca always formed unstable outer sphere structure on mineral surface and can be washed out at ph below 8 5 antelo et al 2015 leaving no chance for the formation of ca p precipitates therefore the key starting process of ca p precipitation on mineral surfaces should be the interaction of supplementary soluble ca with the initially adsorbed p species to form a ternary surface complex such as feo2 po2 ca with the adsorbed p acting as the bridging molecule subsequently a p ca surface precipitate was gradually formed in the locally reactive region of the ferrihydrite surface where ca and p were supersaturated the increasing amounts of those p ca precipitates on ferrihydrite resulted in a significantly higher rate of removal of p which further demonstrated the hypothesized enhancement mechanism on the fe ti composite by the formation a surface precipitate of ca with adsorbed p interestingly in the presence of both p and ca with ferrihydrite at ph 7 amfepo4 4 26 was observed but it was not significant 5 using fe ti composite which revealed that the coprecipitated ti in the fe ti composite inhibited the release of fe and subsequently the formation of amfepo4 the supplementary acetate at 1 mm and 5 mm with ca 0 5 mm and 3 mm generally brought no significant change on the distributions of p species at ph 7 on fe ti composite figs 4 5 and table s4 however the percentages of fe adsorbed species were decreased when 3 mm ca and acetate were coexisting at ph 4 resulting in an increase of amfepo4 reaching 23 for 1 mm and 13 for 5 mm acetate respectively this much higher amfepo4 comparing to single ca may be because more acetate facilitated more dissolution of fe 50 7 84 8 μg l at acidic ph in comparison with the concentration of 12 3 27 9 μg l in the p adsorption control experiment no obvious observation of amfepo4 in the presence of 0 5 mm ca and acetate may be caused by the inhibited role on fe dissolution from lower concentration of ca although this should be further explored a previous study has confirmed that a similar divalent cation i e mg2 may also lead to a decrease in the dissolution of goethite and fe p nucleation probably by forming an adsorption structure of feoh 2mg or feoh 2mgoh wang et al 2015 therefore acetate like organic chemicals including humic acid complicated the influence of ca on the interaction of p with fe minerals this may be a topic of future research because such a situation is prevalent in soil and water systems based on our analysis a scheme for the interaction of p with ca and acetate on the fe ti composite was proposed fig s15 at ph 4 more protons on surface functional groups as well as the adsorbed p complexes fe ti o2 po2h2 may restrain further ternary complexation of positively charged ca in solution with the p adsorbed on the surface of the fe ti composite kwon and kubicki 2004 moreover ca p precipitates including hydroxyapatite were soluble below ph 4 5 bengtsson et al 2009 thus such precipitation was not favored the presence of acetate triggered more dissolution of fe from fe ti composite particularly at ph 4 promoting the formation of amfepo4 at a near neutral ph of approximate 7 the dominant surface adsorption species was the negatively charged bidentate nonprotonated feo2 po2 luengo et al 2006 which favored ca adsorption then the co adsorption of ca on the feo2 po2 layer due to electrostatic attraction led to the formation of feo2 po2 ca ternary complexes subsequently the adsorbed ca provided an additional link for the aqueous p to form more surface ca p precipitates including hydroxyapatite hydroxyapatite is a more stable species than other precipitates such as brushite cahpo4 2h2o or amorphous ca3 po4 2 borkiewicz et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 which favours p stabilization on the surface of minerals therefore at ph 7 positively charged ca is ready to interact with the initially negatively charged complex of p adsorbed on the fe ti surface forming ternary complexes and surface hydroxyapatite kubicki et al 2007 3 5 p removal and recovery from real wastewater to evaluate the potential application of the fe ti composite for the removal and recovery of p from actual wastewater five adsorption regeneration reuse cycles of the adsorbent were performed fig 6 the regeneration test showed that 1 0 m naoh solution rather than 0 1 m or 0 5 m increased the recovery rate of p to 96 2 2 2 therefore this solution was adopted in the five cycle adsorption experiments at ph 5 and 7 when the spent adsorbent was regenerated using 1 m naoh or 0 05 m hcl 1 m naoh there was no obvious decline in their removal rate of p which was always greater than 87 4 fig 6 the influence of the high amount of organic content 499 559 mg l as total organic carbon was not observed in p removal behaviour this was consistent with the results for the acetate effect although a high concentration of soluble fe was observed 113 735 μg l the results indicated a good adsorbent of fe ti composite for wastewater p removal the presence of so4 2 hco3 and cl in the current wastewater sample usually leads to a slight inhibiting role in p adsorptive removal zhang et al 2009 because of the formation of much stronger and more stable inner sphere complexes of p with metal oxide minerals than these anions kubicki et al 2007 pincus et al 2020 stachowicz et al 2008 the p recovery rates of five cycles at ph 5 were constant at 89 8 97 9 but decreasing trend from 90 2 at the 1st cycle to 67 1 at the 5th cycle at ph 7 fig 6 the enriched high p in the regenerated eluate can be easily recovered as hap zhang et al 2022 or struvite drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 as potential fertilizer by adding additional chemicals if necessary a few amounts of p 0 9 of the total removed p and ca 26 of the total removed ca were observed in the pre treated regenerated solution of dilute hcl suggesting slight formation of ca p precipitate suresh kumar et al 2018 consistent with the synthetic batch experiment however the lower recovery of p from the removal products at ph 7 indicated that the precipitated ca species in the products from wastewater cannot be efficiently released and recovered using the traditionally recommended solution sonoda et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 suggesting the enhanced removed p by the ready ca p precipitate at neutral ph is not a good option for wastewater p recovery these results justify further work to optimize for p recovery from wastewater in both batch and fixed bed experiments 4 conclusions the interaction of phosphates with mineral adsorbents is largely influenced by cations and organic compounds which is a critical issue for the recovery of p from wastewater the current work elucidated the interfacial reactions of p with a novel fe ti coprecipitated bimetal oxide composite at different ph values and in the presence of ca and acetate representative cationic and organic components in real wastewater molecular scale characterization indicated that ti coprecipitation contributed to p adsorption at ph 4 and inhibited fe dissolution and subsequent formation of amfepo4 the presence of ca increased p removal by complexation with the adsorbed p on the mineral surface by forming a hydroxyapatite precipitate at a circumneutral ph the reusability of the fe ti composite was successfully achieved by a simple regeneration treatment using an alkaline solution this proved that the as synthesized adsorbent had a stable adsorption ability to effectively remove and recover p from wastewater and possibly other types of contaminated water considering the complexity of various water matrices future work is warranted to confirm the influence of cations and natural organic matter such as humic acid on p adsorption in addition the impact of ca and acetate on p removal and recovery from simulated and real wastewater can be further monitored in a continuous flow dynamic system for a scalable long term operation which is more practical and feasible for actual conditions credit authorship contribution statement jinli cui methodology formal analysis investigation writing original

14938,understanding the interactions between phosphate p and mineral adsorbents is critical for removing and recovering p from wastewater especially in the presence of both cationic and organic components to this end we investigated the surface interactions of p with an iron titanium coprecipitated oxide composite in the presence of ca 0 5 3 0 mm and acetate 1 5 mm and quantified the molecular complexes and tested the possible removal and recovery of p from real wastewater a quantitative analysis of p k edge x ray absorption near edge structure xanes confirmed the inner sphere surface complexation of p with both fe and ti whose contribution to p adsorption relies on their surface charge determined by ph conditions the effects of ca and acetate on p removal were highly ph dependent at ph 7 ca 0 5 3 0 mm in solution significantly increased p removal by 13 30 by precipitating the surface adsorbed p forming hydroxyapatite 14 26 the presence of acetate had no obvious influence on p removal capacity and molecular mechanisms at ph 7 at ph 4 the removal amount of p was not obviously affected by the presence of ca and acetate however acetate and high ca concentration jointly facilitated the formation of amorphous fepo4 precipitate complicating the interactions of p with fe ti composite in comparison with ferrihydrite the fe ti composite significantly decreased the formation of amorphous fepo4 probably by decreasing fe dissolution due to the coprecipitated ti component facilitating further p recovery an understanding of these microscopic mechanisms can lead to the successful use and simple regeneration of the adsorbent to recover p from real wastewater keywords phosphorus removal bimetal oxide composite surface complexation and precipitation ternary complexes data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction large amounts of phosphate p in wastewater often cause eutrophication in the receiving surface waters because p is a non regenerable and limited resource on earth it is necessary to recover p from wastewater effluents particularly from the perspective of a circular economy an adsorptive strategy using a metal oxide based adsorbent is commonly used to remove p from wastewater because of its low cost easy operability high removal efficiency and reusability sonoda et al 2020 kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2009 the removal efficiency and recovery of p are often affected by wastewater components that include large amounts of ca and organic components previous studies employed various metal oxides as adsorbents and demonstrated that high concentrations of ca often increase the adsorption efficiency of negatively charged anions such as p and as hu et al 2015 talebi atouei et al 2016 this is probably due to the presence of additional electrostatic forces surface ternary complexation and or surface precipitation zhang et al 2019 it has been suggested that some ternary surface complexes of ca with adsorbed p ca p mineral form on goethite gao and mucci 2003 ferrihydrite antelo et al 2015 mendez and hiemstra 2020 and hydrous zirconium oxide over a ph range of 6 9 lin et al 2017 furthermore precipitates such as hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 hap were observed on the surface of boehmite from ph 7 to 9 li et al 2012 in addition to cahpo4 on hydrous zirconium oxides lin et al 2017 and amorphous ca3 po4 2 on lanthanum hydroxide at ph 9 fang et al 2017 although these p ca ternary complexes or precipitates have been widely observed their presence at circumneutral or alkaline ph clearly influences the process of desorbing and regenerating p using the suggested naoh solution suresh kumar et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 but this was not clearly demonstrated in the case of complicated real wastewater high concentrations of organic acids in wastewater may compete with p for adsorption sites shi et al 2010 acetic acid one of the most abundant components 30 0 83 5 mg l in wastewater chen et al 2004 tong and chen 2009 was shown to often interact with the adsorption sites on iron fe oxides and promotes fe dissolution spalla and kékicheff 1997 and a high concentration of oxalic acid in simulated wastewater decreased the removal of p on ca rich solid waste by 50 drapanauskaite et al 2021 it was reported that citrate and acetate inhibited p adsorption on goethite geelhoed et al 1998 shi et al 2010 furthermore the presence of organic acids may influence the interaction between ca and adsorbed p on metal oxides although such information remains unclear therefore it is necessary to investigate the synergistic reactions of coexisting ca and organic acids mixtures with p and their impact on the removal and recovery of p from wastewater recently to increase the sorption capacity of p various fe based bimetal oxide materials have been synthesized including fe al khare et al 2005 liu and hesterberg 2011 fe mn zhang et al 2009 fe zr zhang et al 2017 fe la wu et al 2017 and fe ti d arcy et al 2011 lu et al 2015 these bimetal oxide adsorbents can enhance the removal of p by utilizing a more amorphous or porous structure with a higher density of hydroxyl adsorption sites on their surface introduced by the coprecipitated metal liu and hesterberg 2011 zhang et al 2017 titanium based materials are nontoxic and highly stable under acidic and basic conditions and were widely used for remediating pollutants including p wang et al 2017a and its analogues such as arsenic yan et al 2016 the coprecipitated metal oxide critically influenced p adsorption mechanism s a role that has been overlooked liu and hesterberg 2011 particularly in wastewater with atypical composition last the possible dissolution of fe from fe based bimetal oxide in the presence of both ca and organic chemicals was not confirmed in previous studies and it may influence the interfacial complexation of p on mineral surfaces and further the reusability of adsorbents in this study we synthesized a typical ti and fe coprecipitated bimetal oxide adsorbent fe ti composite for p removal and recovery in simulated water and actual wastewater and focused on the synergistic impact of ca and acetate the specific enhancing role of ti was elucidated and the macroscopic and molecular level mechanism s of p in the presence of ca and acetate were investigated we aimed to elucidate the possible surface complexation or precipitation between ca acetate and p on the bimetal oxide umder different ph values using synchrotron based x ray absorption near edge structure xanes techniques and finally provide an easy regeneration process for p removal and recovery from realistic wastewater using fe ti composite 2 materials and experiments 2 1 chemicals and preparation of ti coprecipitated fe composite bimetal oxides stock solutions were prepared with reagent grade k2hpo4 nacl cacl2 and ch3coona a stock solution of 1000 mg p l was prepared by dissolving k2hpo4 in di water storing it at 4 c and using it within two weeks the ti coprecipitated fe composite bimetal oxide fe ti composite was synthesized using 6 16 g fe no3 3 9h2o and 1 49 g of tioso4 molar ratio of fe ti at 4 in 1 0 l di water and adjusting the ph to 7 0 using 5 m naoh washed filtered and freeze dried to obtain the final fe ti composite adsorbent for comparison ferrihydrite and tio2 were synthesized according to previous studies luo et al 2010 mendez and hiemstra 2020 2 2 batch adsorption experiments kinetic experiments were performed by reacting 2 mm p with 0 8 g l of fe ti composite in 0 04 m nacl solution to simulate surface water the experiments were performed for 24 h at ph 7 0 and 4 0 with sampling at designated time intervals the two ph values were selected considering ph variations in various wastewater or acidogenesis effluents li and li 2017 olabode et al 2020 yu and fang 2002 isotherm experiments were conducted by transferring working solution into sets of tubes containing 0 8 g l of fe ti composite and increasing concentrations of p 0 13 mm with 0 04 m nacl at ph 7 or 4 adsorption edge experiments were investigated to determine the percentage of p adsorbed as a function of the final equilibrium ph of the suspension the effect of ionic strength on p adsorption was tested in solutions with different nacl concentrations 0 04 0 4 mol l which represent typical matrices of natural waters and wastewater ajmal et al 2018 lǚ et al 2013 and usually show negligible influence on the inner sphere adsorption structure of p on adsorbent material antelo et al 2005 mallet et al 2013 the designed ph was maintained during all the adsorption experiment using dilute naoh and hcl to study the effect of ca and acetate suspensions containing 2 mm p or blends of 2 mm p with 0 5 3 mm ca and 1 5 mm acetate were mixed and adjusted to ph 4 or 7 representing the chemistry variations in wastewater the mixing suspensions were supplemented with 0 8 g l fe ti composite kept at ph 4 or 7 and rotated for 24 h like that in p adsorption experiment furthermore the possible formation of the ca p precipitate was investigated by changing the sequential addition of ca 3 mm and p 2 mm to ferrihydrite with 0 04 m nacl at ph 7 with experimental details shown in the supplementary material the experimental concentrations of p and ca were selected to prevent their possible precipitation in solution according to a calculation using visual minteq the possible removal and recovery of p using the fe ti composite material 0 3 g l was further tested using wastewater samples 4 55 0 28 mg p l 27 8 1 6 mg ca l 900 49 mg so4 2 l 273 14 mg hco3 l 277 16 mg cl l 534 14 mg toc l ph 5 2 mainly derived from the fermentation of food waste in comparison with synthetic water a smaller amount of fe ti composite 0 3 g l was used which was sufficient for p removal from wastewater the ph of the wastewater was adjusted to 5 similar to that of raw wastewater or 7 for possible enhanced p removal the reusability of adsorbent was tested by five adsorption regeneration reuse cycles the p desorption process for adsorbent regeneration was optimized using different concentrations 0 1 m 0 5 m or 1 0 m of naoh before naoh treatment dilute hcl 0 05 m and 0 1 m was tested to dissolve the ca p precipitate if present sonoda et al 2020 all of the above batch samples were mixed on a rotator for 24 h centrifuged and filtered 0 45 μm before further analysis 2 3 characterization and analysis the concentration of p in solution was determined using the molybdenum blue spectrophotometric method with a uv vis spectrophotometer spectra uv 11 mrc germany at 880 nm the possible dissolution of fe from the material was confirmed by fe analysis of the solution sample using icp ms agilent 8800 characterization experiment included bet surface area analysis x ray powder diffraction xrd x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy points of zero charge phpzc and scanning electron microscopy sem the xanes at the p k edge was performed at the tls 16a1 beamline in the national synchrotron radiation research center nsrrc in taiwan following our previous procedures cui et al 2022 li et al 2020 details are shown in the supplementary material 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterization the morphological structure and surface element analysis of fe oxide ferrihydrite titanium oxide tio2 and the fe ti composite were shown in fig s1 s2 the as synthesized fe ti composite material showed coarse surfaces similar to those of pure fe oxide and ti oxide as identified by the sem edx analysis while fe and ti showed similar distributions in the fabricated material the xrd results fig s3 for the fe ti composite contained two broad diffraction peaks at angles 2θ of 34 and 61 showing that ferrihydrite was the major constituent jia et al 2006 similar to the characteristic of pure fe oxide no obvious tio2 phase was observed in the fe ti composite probably because of the high content of fe component lu et al 2015 the bet surface area of ferrihydrite was 260 m2 g which was consistent with the previously reported range of 229 427 m2 g antelo et al 2015 cerkez et al 2015 wang et al 2013 the surface area of fe ti composite was as large as 384 m2 g which was much higher than the previously reported 32 9 133 5 m2 g of the nanostructured fe ti adsorbents d arcy et al 2011 lu et al 2015 probably due to the use of the free drying process at low temperature in the present study wang et al 2013 in comparison with ferrihydrite and tio2 the fe ti bimetal oxide showed less negative charge on the surface at ph 6 fig s4 and may enhance the adsorption of negatively charged p compared with the pure metal oxide antelo et al 2005 suresh kumar et al 2018 the electronic structure of the fe ti composite was analyzed using xps fig 1a b and c in ferrihydrite the binding energies were 710 9 ev fe 2p3 2 and 724 5 ev fe 2p1 2 for the fe 2p spectra which shifted up to 711 1 ev and 724 7 ev in the fe ti composite consistently the ti 2p spectra shifted down from 458 9 ev and 464 7 ev in tio2 to 458 6 ev and 464 4 ev in the fe ti composite these synergistic shifts indicated the withdrawing of electrons from fe3 and moving of electrons to ti4 therefore the formation of a composite structure of fe o ti with more hydroxyl groups in the fe ti coprecipitate was proposed which can probably lead to more adsorbate adsorption mallet et al 2013 yu et al 2019 the calculated relative amount of hydroxyl groups m oh in the fe ti composite 32 8 was similar to that for ferrihydrite 32 4 and greater than that for tio2 15 8 showing that the major fe component in the fe ti composite made a major contribution to adsorption accordingly the oh groups observed in the fe ti composite from the ftir analysis showed significant peaks at 988 1056 and 1123 cm 1 fig 1d similar to ferrihydrite wang et al 2017b and fe mn binary oxide zhang et al 2007 the broad peaks at 480 600 and 690 cm 1 may be attributed to bulk oh deformation bands in the fe ti material wang et al 2017b the coupling of changes in the binding energies of fe and ti surface charge and surface area of the fe ti composite compared with ferrihydrite and tio2 revealed that the composite was not a simple physical mixture of ti and fe oxides zhang et al 2005 3 2 batch adsorption the removal of p was rapid during the first hour and then gradually slowed after five hours when it began to reach saturation fig 2a the kinetic data were accurately described using a pseudo second order kinetics model jing et al 2012 phosphate adsorption decreased significantly at a higher ph e g from 1 27 mmol g at ph 4 to 0 85 mmol g at ph 7 while the adsorption rate was much higher at ph 7 5 9396 g mmol h than at ph 4 2 9791 g mmol h fig 2a similar results for the effect of ph on p removal were observed in previous studies on ferrihydrite mallet et al 2013 wang et al 2017b goethite geelhoed et al 1998 and other composite materials lu et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 the effect of ph on p adsorptive removal was shown in fig s5 at ph 2 70 of p was removed while 40 was removed at ph 6 and 20 at ph 10 consistent with the typical behavior of oxyanion adsorption on minerals antelo et al 2005 at a ph range lower than 5 2 the fe ti surface showed a positive charge fig s4 which favored the adsorption of negatively charged forms of p including h2po4 and hpo4 2 lu et al 2015 with increasing ph negative charge began to accumulate on the mineral surface of the fe ti oxide which would gradually limit the adsorption of p furthermore the adsorption energy of the major species of h2po4 at acidic ph was less than that of hpo4 2 and po4 3 kubicki et al 2007 confirming the thermodynamically favorable adsorption of p at low ph range the capacity of fe ti composite for p removal at ph 4 and ph 7 was investigated using an isothermal adsorption experiment fig 2b langmuir modeling results showed a maximum adsorption capacity of 2 05 mmol p g at ph 4 38 higher than 1 36 mmol p g at ph 7 the synthesized material showed a relatively high removal capacity for p in comparison with other fe based metal oxide adsorbents exhibiting 0 05 1 69 median of 0 44 mmol p g at ph 4 5 and 0 02 2 15 median of 1 00 mmol p g at ph 6 7 as summarized in table s1 interestingly the synthesized fe ti composite showed a higher capacity than a previous nanostructured fe ti bimetal oxide adsorbent 1 01 1 18 mmol p g at ph 6 8 d arcy et al 2011 lu et al 2015 the higher surface area of as synthesized fe ti composite provided more availability to the reactive hydroxyl reactive sites on the surface of particles hence leading to increased adsorption ability gypser et al 2018 exploration of the controlling factors on comparative p adsorption capacity by various fe based adsorbent materials presents interesting results table s1 the reported adsorption capacities were estimated by langmuir modeling of isotherm experiment which is performed by a series of p concentrations when the available adsorption sites are sufficiently occupied by p therefore this isotherm estimated adsorption capacity is not only crucially governed by initial p concentration but also affected by various other parameters including adsorption sites ph specific surface area etc the amount of available adsorption sites i e hydroxyl groups should be the theoretical maximum limit for p binding on adsorbent liu et al 2021 wang et al 2013 zeng et al 2008 because ph plays a crucial role in p adsorption the reported adsorption capacities were further divided into two groups including ph 4 5 and ph 6 7 and normalized by adsorbent dosage as shown in fig s6 the comparative results showed that with increasing bet surface area distinctively different p adsorption behaviors were observed at different ph ranges at ph 4 5 p adsorption capacity linearly increased with increasing surface area fig s6a while no obvious relationship was observed at ph 6 7 fig s6b these previously published data of p adsorption capacity from various fe based metal oxides collectively demonstrated that at acidic ph high surface area largely facilitated p removal allowing rapid transport of negatively charged p from solution to positive surface reactive sites through internal pores due to electrostatic attraction lǚ et al 2013 zeng et al 2008 when the availability of surface binding sites of materials was enhanced liu et al 2021 wang et al 2013 in contrast at neutral ph of 6 7 the amount of p adsorption is largely inhibited by the repulsion of both negatively charged p and binding sites lǚ et al 2013 in this neutral condition the impact of specific surface area plays a much less role in p adsorption than ph because these materials and experimental conditions were much different table s1 the critical parameters determining the scattered distribution of p adsorption capacities at neural ph remain unclear which may be explored in future work the influences of ionic strength on p adsorption were determined using increasing concentrations of nacl from 0 04 m to 0 40 m to simulate surface water and saline wastewater an important condition in hong kong there was no significant influence of ionic strength on p adsorption over the ph range 2 10 fig s5 this result was consistent with the adsorption of p on ferrihydrite mallet et al 2013 tio2 kang et al 2011 goethite antelo et al 2005 and fe mn binary oxides zhang et al 2009 slightly higher removal percentages 2 8 of p were observed for higher ionic strengths 0 10 m and 0 40 m nacl in comparison with 0 04 m nacl at a circumneutral ph ph 6 increasing ionic strength often facilitates inner sphere adsorption by decreasing the electrostatic repulsion between the charged mineral surface and p antelo et al 2005 wu et al 2017 at ph 4 ca showed no pronounced effect but slightly decreased p removal 5 6 fig 3 which was consistent with the results of previous studies lin et al 2017 talebi atouei et al 2016 at ph 7 the addition of 0 5 mm ca slightly increased p adsorption from 0 90 to 1 02 mmol g 13 and a further 3 mm ca supplementation significantly p 0 01 increased p removal to 1 17 mmol g 30 fig 3 the ph dependent effect of ca on p adsorption was similar to that of interactions between ca and arsenate antelo et al 2015 hu et al 2015 yan et al 2016 in solutions with the same concentrations of p and ca without the adsorbent at ph 7 no precipitate of p with ca formed as determined by a visual minteq chemical calculation main forms of p h2po4 and hpo4 2 therefore the outer sphere adsorption of positively charged ca ph 7 antelo et al 2015 talebi atouei et al 2016 formed a complex with the negatively charged adsorbed p on mineral surfaces which was probably promoted by electrostatic attraction lin et al 2017 favoring more p removal recent studies revealed that various organic acids including acetate are present with p in wastewater and have a competitive effect on p removal chen et al 2004 zhang et al 2021 therefore one of the most prevalent organic chemicals acetate was selected and its effect on p removal was evaluated the results fig 3 indicated that p removal was slightly increased by 5 mm acetate supplementation together with ca at ph 7 while 1 mm acetate compromised the slightly negative role of ca at ph 4 acetic acid represents one of the key carboxylic groups in humic acid which generally exhibits a limited effect on p adsorption by ferrihydrite and goethite borggaard et al 2005 further molecular evidence explaining the synergistic influence from acetate and ca on p removal on the fe ti composite was investigated in the following sections 3 3 molecular mechanism of p removal by the fe ti composite in the high resolution xps spectra of oxygen the position at 531 5 ev fig 1c table s2 is usually attributed to the oh group mallet et al 2013 yu et al 2019 which is considered to contribute to p adsorption nevertheless the peak intensity of the oh group from the o 1 s high resolution xps spectra showed no decrease after p adsorption a previous study demonstrated that the binding energy level of o p in the fepo4 2h2o compound was close to that of the oh in ferrihydrite mallet et al 2013 thereafter the possible occurrence of fe ti o p bonding after adsorption luengo et al 2006 may show a new peak after p adsorption at the similar position to that of oh group resulting in no obvious change of the peak intensity of oh group further ftir analysis fig 1d showed the presence of the oh group on the fe ti composite through bending vibration at 1123 1056 and 988 cm 1 zhang et al 2009 and deformation band at 700 cm 1 wang et al 2017b the ftir band intensities of the oh group decreased after p adsorption demonstrating that the oh group was involved in p adsorption wang et al 2017b the peaks at 1096 cm 1 were assigned to the adsorbed po4 3 group and the peak at 1020 cm 1 belonged to the stretching mode of p o fe ti similar to the adsorption products of p by ferrihydrite arai and sparks 2001 the observed ftir peaks revealed the formation of an inner sphere complex of the adsorbed p on the surface of the fe ti composite arai and sparks 2001 the spectral features of xanes are sensitive to the molecular coordination of p as shown in standard references fig s7 several spectral features can be identified such as the pre edge feature peak a for p associated with fe or ti oxide and a prominent peak peak b 2154 2 ev for the inorganic p valence state the pre edge feature peak a belonging to the adsorbed p was not observed for the ca associated phosphate species including hydroxyapatite brushite cahpo4 2h2o and ca hpo4 2 the p ca complex or precipitate exhibited a clear difference with a feature peak at 2153 5 ev peak b and a post edge peak c while peak d represented the crystalline degree and a wide broad peak peak e represented the oxygen oscillation ingall et al 2011 prietzel et al 2016 the p adsorbed samples showed a primary peak at approximately 2154 1 ev peak b fig 4 consistent with the dominance of the inorganic p valence state the pre edge feature peak a indicated that p was adsorbed on the fe ti composite via inner sphere surface complexation with a metal element fe or ti the feature peaks of the adsorbed p on the fe ti composite showed no difference at ph 4 and 7 fig 4 because the adsorbed p primarily formed bidentate binuclear structures on metal oxides independent of the ph prietzel et al 2016 tian et al 2017 the intensity and shape of the pre edge feature peak a for p adsorbed on ferrihydrite and tio2 differed figs 4 and s7 therefore the exact contribution of each composite in the fe ti composite for p removal could be deciphered the linear combination fitting lcf analysis of the xanes spectra showed that the fe component in the fe ti composite contributed greatly to p adsorption reaching 80 at ph 4 and 96 at ph 7 fig 5 and table s4 correspondingly the ti component contributed to 15 at ph 4 and 4 at ph 7 with a small percentage of fepo4 5 the contribution of the ti component at ph 4 was generally consistent with its molar percentage 19 the charge of tio2 at ph 7 was more negative than that of ferrihydrite fig s4 which contributed to higher repulsion between the negatively charged p and surface negative hydroxyl groups on tio2 similar to the higher sorption capacity of arsenate observed on goethite than tio2 at circumneutral ph nair et al 2014 the result of comparison between tio2 and ferrihydrite may contribute to the ph dependent performance of the ti component for p adsorption in the fe ti composite iron solubility from minerals often affects p removal capacity wang et al 2017b for our experimental conditions a small amount of dissolved fe was observed during p removal 27 9 12 5 μg l at ph 4 and 12 3 1 2 μg l at ph 7 an amorphous p fe precipitate such as amfepo4 could somewhat reflect the interaction of p with dissolved fe on fe based minerals a p xanes analysis showed a possible formation of an amorphous p fe precipitate as amfepo4 reaching 5 at ph 4 table s4 similar to the detection limit of xanes foster and kim 2014 the formation of the fe p precipitate was caused by the association of adsorbed p with dissolved fe from ferrihydrite dissolution at low ph 3 5 particularly when the sequestrated p exceeded the limit of 0 92 mmol p g wang et al 2017b 3 4 influencing mechanism of ca and acetate on p removal the ph dependent effect of ca on p removal indicates that some reactions between p and ca occurred on the surface of minerals particularly at ph 7 the solid phase of the fe ti adsorbent with p and ca at a circumneutral ph was further characterized as identified by the sem analysis figure s1 p removal had no significant influence on the morphology of the fe ti composite the simultaneous presence of 0 3 mm ca showed small particles on the surface and further addition of ca to 3 mm resulted in more plate shaped particles an sem image and an edx mapping analysis at several points on the newly formed particles showed significant amounts of p and ca fig s8 s13 table s3 these heterogeneous sized particles suggested that p ca precipitates formed due to the gradual reaction of locally concentrated ca with the surface adsorbed p on fe ti wang et al 2015 a crystalline p ca species of hydroxyapatite was identified during the removal of p with 3 mm ca fig s4 according to a standard reference jcpds 09 0432 ikeda 2000 the results suggested that hydroxyapatite precipitate formed under a high concentration of ca this was confirmed by the ftir results fig 1d showing significant peaks at 562 and 1034 cm 1 which were attributed to the bending mode of the po4 3 group in hydroxyapatite berzina cimdina and borodajenko 2012 jastrzębski et al 2011 quantitative information on the p ca precipitate in the synergistic presence of p and ca at different molar ratios was further investigated using xanes techniques andersson et al 2016 quantitative lcf results for xanes figs 4 5 and table s4 identified that when ca was supplemented a new p ca precipitate of hydroxyapatite was formed and was significantly increased from 14 0 5 mm ca to 26 3 mm ca therefore the surface precipitate of hydroxyapatite contributed to an increase in p removal in the presence of ca at ph 7 the positive effect of ca on the p removal at neutral ph was reported for other minerals such as ferrihydrite antelo et al 2015 goethite gao and mucci 2003 talebi atouei et al 2016 hydrous zirconium oxide lin et al 2017 and lanthanum hydroxides fang et al 2017 where different complexes between ca and p formed for example two small characteristic peaks for hydroxyapatite were observed at ph 7 on boehmite from xrd patterns li et al 2012 a previous study observed the formation of brushite at ph 6 5 on degussa p25 tio2 surfaces ronson and mcquillan 2002 however the exact interfacial precipitation process of ca p was not well understood no observed impact from ca on p adsorption at ph 4 fig 3 is caused by the ready solubility of ca p precipitate and the little amount of ca adsorption as a result of both positively charged ca and mineral surface at acidic ph changing the addition sequence of ca and p and using the separated adsorbed solid from the dissolved fraction may help us to further understand details of the interfacial interaction process in addition ferrihydrite was used to exclude the influence of the coprecipitated ti component in the fe ti composite phosphate was first adsorbed on ferrihydrite slurry pre adsorbed p at ph 7 and then the supernatant was discarded and washed before the addition of soluble ca which resulted in an observation of ca p precipitate 5 9 spectra d and e fig s14 and table s4 controversially adding soluble p to the ferrihydrite slurry with pre adsorbed ca resulted in no such precipitate 1 spectra f and g when both p and ca were present in a ferrihydrite suspension at ph 7 a large quantity of p ca precipitate such as hydroxyapatite accounted for 24 33 of the solid product similar to the fe ti composite a previous study demonstrated that pre adsorbed ca always formed unstable outer sphere structure on mineral surface and can be washed out at ph below 8 5 antelo et al 2015 leaving no chance for the formation of ca p precipitates therefore the key starting process of ca p precipitation on mineral surfaces should be the interaction of supplementary soluble ca with the initially adsorbed p species to form a ternary surface complex such as feo2 po2 ca with the adsorbed p acting as the bridging molecule subsequently a p ca surface precipitate was gradually formed in the locally reactive region of the ferrihydrite surface where ca and p were supersaturated the increasing amounts of those p ca precipitates on ferrihydrite resulted in a significantly higher rate of removal of p which further demonstrated the hypothesized enhancement mechanism on the fe ti composite by the formation a surface precipitate of ca with adsorbed p interestingly in the presence of both p and ca with ferrihydrite at ph 7 amfepo4 4 26 was observed but it was not significant 5 using fe ti composite which revealed that the coprecipitated ti in the fe ti composite inhibited the release of fe and subsequently the formation of amfepo4 the supplementary acetate at 1 mm and 5 mm with ca 0 5 mm and 3 mm generally brought no significant change on the distributions of p species at ph 7 on fe ti composite figs 4 5 and table s4 however the percentages of fe adsorbed species were decreased when 3 mm ca and acetate were coexisting at ph 4 resulting in an increase of amfepo4 reaching 23 for 1 mm and 13 for 5 mm acetate respectively this much higher amfepo4 comparing to single ca may be because more acetate facilitated more dissolution of fe 50 7 84 8 μg l at acidic ph in comparison with the concentration of 12 3 27 9 μg l in the p adsorption control experiment no obvious observation of amfepo4 in the presence of 0 5 mm ca and acetate may be caused by the inhibited role on fe dissolution from lower concentration of ca although this should be further explored a previous study has confirmed that a similar divalent cation i e mg2 may also lead to a decrease in the dissolution of goethite and fe p nucleation probably by forming an adsorption structure of feoh 2mg or feoh 2mgoh wang et al 2015 therefore acetate like organic chemicals including humic acid complicated the influence of ca on the interaction of p with fe minerals this may be a topic of future research because such a situation is prevalent in soil and water systems based on our analysis a scheme for the interaction of p with ca and acetate on the fe ti composite was proposed fig s15 at ph 4 more protons on surface functional groups as well as the adsorbed p complexes fe ti o2 po2h2 may restrain further ternary complexation of positively charged ca in solution with the p adsorbed on the surface of the fe ti composite kwon and kubicki 2004 moreover ca p precipitates including hydroxyapatite were soluble below ph 4 5 bengtsson et al 2009 thus such precipitation was not favored the presence of acetate triggered more dissolution of fe from fe ti composite particularly at ph 4 promoting the formation of amfepo4 at a near neutral ph of approximate 7 the dominant surface adsorption species was the negatively charged bidentate nonprotonated feo2 po2 luengo et al 2006 which favored ca adsorption then the co adsorption of ca on the feo2 po2 layer due to electrostatic attraction led to the formation of feo2 po2 ca ternary complexes subsequently the adsorbed ca provided an additional link for the aqueous p to form more surface ca p precipitates including hydroxyapatite hydroxyapatite is a more stable species than other precipitates such as brushite cahpo4 2h2o or amorphous ca3 po4 2 borkiewicz et al 2010 zhang et al 2019 which favours p stabilization on the surface of minerals therefore at ph 7 positively charged ca is ready to interact with the initially negatively charged complex of p adsorbed on the fe ti surface forming ternary complexes and surface hydroxyapatite kubicki et al 2007 3 5 p removal and recovery from real wastewater to evaluate the potential application of the fe ti composite for the removal and recovery of p from actual wastewater five adsorption regeneration reuse cycles of the adsorbent were performed fig 6 the regeneration test showed that 1 0 m naoh solution rather than 0 1 m or 0 5 m increased the recovery rate of p to 96 2 2 2 therefore this solution was adopted in the five cycle adsorption experiments at ph 5 and 7 when the spent adsorbent was regenerated using 1 m naoh or 0 05 m hcl 1 m naoh there was no obvious decline in their removal rate of p which was always greater than 87 4 fig 6 the influence of the high amount of organic content 499 559 mg l as total organic carbon was not observed in p removal behaviour this was consistent with the results for the acetate effect although a high concentration of soluble fe was observed 113 735 μg l the results indicated a good adsorbent of fe ti composite for wastewater p removal the presence of so4 2 hco3 and cl in the current wastewater sample usually leads to a slight inhibiting role in p adsorptive removal zhang et al 2009 because of the formation of much stronger and more stable inner sphere complexes of p with metal oxide minerals than these anions kubicki et al 2007 pincus et al 2020 stachowicz et al 2008 the p recovery rates of five cycles at ph 5 were constant at 89 8 97 9 but decreasing trend from 90 2 at the 1st cycle to 67 1 at the 5th cycle at ph 7 fig 6 the enriched high p in the regenerated eluate can be easily recovered as hap zhang et al 2022 or struvite drenkova tuhtan et al 2017 as potential fertilizer by adding additional chemicals if necessary a few amounts of p 0 9 of the total removed p and ca 26 of the total removed ca were observed in the pre treated regenerated solution of dilute hcl suggesting slight formation of ca p precipitate suresh kumar et al 2018 consistent with the synthetic batch experiment however the lower recovery of p from the removal products at ph 7 indicated that the precipitated ca species in the products from wastewater cannot be efficiently released and recovered using the traditionally recommended solution sonoda et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 suggesting the enhanced removed p by the ready ca p precipitate at neutral ph is not a good option for wastewater p recovery these results justify further work to optimize for p recovery from wastewater in both batch and fixed bed experiments 4 conclusions the interaction of phosphates with mineral adsorbents is largely influenced by cations and organic compounds which is a critical issue for the recovery of p from wastewater the current work elucidated the interfacial reactions of p with a novel fe ti coprecipitated bimetal oxide composite at different ph values and in the presence of ca and acetate representative cationic and organic components in real wastewater molecular scale characterization indicated that ti coprecipitation contributed to p adsorption at ph 4 and inhibited fe dissolution and subsequent formation of amfepo4 the presence of ca increased p removal by complexation with the adsorbed p on the mineral surface by forming a hydroxyapatite precipitate at a circumneutral ph the reusability of the fe ti composite was successfully achieved by a simple regeneration treatment using an alkaline solution this proved that the as synthesized adsorbent had a stable adsorption ability to effectively remove and recover p from wastewater and possibly other types of contaminated water considering the complexity of various water matrices future work is warranted to confirm the influence of cations and natural organic matter such as humic acid on p adsorption in addition the impact of ca and acetate on p removal and recovery from simulated and real wastewater can be further monitored in a continuous flow dynamic system for a scalable long term operation which is more practical and feasible for actual conditions credit authorship contribution statement jinli cui methodology formal analysis investigation writing original

14939,bacterial quorum quenching qq is an effective strategy for controlling biofouling in membrane bioreactor mbr by interfering the releasing and degradation of signal molecules during quorum sensing qs process however due to the framework feature of qq media the maintenance of qq activity and the restriction of mass transfer threshold it has been difficult to design a more stable and better performing structure in a long period of time in this research electrospun fiber coated hydrogel qq beads qq echb were fabricated by using electrospun nanofiber coated hydrogel to strengthen

available on request 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr where a technology that combines the advantages of activated biological reaction and membrane separation judd 2008 lee et al 2016a min et al 2022 in the past 30 years it has developed into a smaller reactor size that can handle larger fluctuations of effluent water and generate high quality reusable water evolving into a proven technology gu et al 2018a ma et al 2018 since the presence of mbr technology the bottleneck of membrane biofouling has been restricting this technology and it is also motivating the reform and innovation of this technology bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 drews 2010 meng et al 2009 quorum sensing qs was found to be a phenomenon that bacteria regulate their behaviors in groups such as virulence and biofilm formation in a cell density dependent way using signal molecules miller and bassler 2001 oh and lee 2018 waters and bassler 2005 quorum quenching qq is a physicochemical strategy for biofouling

2013 a variety of bacterial immobilization modes have been emerged in the last decade involving cell entrapping beads cebs huang et al 2019b lan et al 2021 li et al 2023 zeng et al 2018 microbial vessel oh et al 2012 won suk et al 2014 sheets nahm et al 2017 rotary microbial carrier frame rmcf ergön can et al 2017 co culture immobilized qq filter membrane and their modified and optimized carriers shah et al 2022 among a series of spherical fiber tube plate frame structure and layer by layer lbl structures we found that free moving millimeter scale qq beads are the most reasonable carrier structure for controlling mbr biofouling for their shape and size can free moving in the aeration environment and scouring the surface of the fiber yu et al 2019 concurrently the entrapped qq bacteria can inhibit the biofouling of the fiber surface by quorum quenching effect kim et al 2013 however since the appearance of qq beads the structure of beads is usually constructed by gel cross linking or multi layer gel cross linking combined with phase transformation so in these research the qq colony was either exposed to an opening environment connected to the external water environment or barred in a closed system with an outer layer constructed by phase inversion making potential impacts on the continued quorum quenching or maintaining the integrity and stability of the structure of the beads a 3d structure membrane typically has a complex porous architecture that allows for high permeability and selectivity the interconnected pores and channels in the membrane provide a large surface area for mass transfer which can improve the efficiency of separation processes li et al 2020 this research first coupled precise surface electrospinning es technology liang et al 2021 shin et

shielding effect of fluorine atoms on carbon frame providing excellent physical and chemical stability liu et al 2011 pang et al 2021 polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf has been reported to be a semi crystalline fluorocarbon polymer with excellent chemical resistance thermal and mechanical properties and have facile and mature membrane forming process we chose it as the ideal material for electrospinning kang and cao 2014 liang et al 2021 liu et al 2011 here a robust 3d porous protective membrane was deposited on the surface of gel beads embedded with rhodococcus sp bh4 strain by using a self made es rotating collector this outer membrane layer of qq beads has excellent elasticity and resistance to physical scour and chemical shock which can protect the core of the beads maintains a complete structure under long term hydraulic erosion and aeration and keep the swelling of the gel core under control huang et al 2018 in addition the porous construction support the core of the beads to exchange materials with the external environment feeding and metabolism of qq bacteria the feasible pore size inhibits the escape of the inner core bacteria keep the qq beads continue to exert the quorum quenching effect and stable physical washing 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of qq hb for preparation of qq hb rhodococcus sp bh4 was used as the qq bacteria because it has the capacity

hour stabilization 2 2 pretreatment of qq hb inspired by cryoprotectants cpas used in the inhibition of the icing of water in biological samples chen et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 glycerol was used to displacing water molecules within the surface of the qq hb briefly the original qq hb were immersed in a glycerol solution for 20min to generate the glycerol based tough hydrogel we called qq hb g 2 3 assembly of qq echb the 10 wt pvdf polymer dope solution was prepared by dissolving pvdf mw 400 000 dupont usa in a mixture of dmf ar mclean biochemical technolog china and acetone ar mclean biochemical technolog china at a volume ratio of 7 3 more specifically the preparation of qq echb from qq hb g is as follows fig 1 the qq hb g were placed in a self made metal hemispherical rotating

following conditions dope solution feeding rate of 3ml h tip to center of rotating collector distance of 10cm positive voltage of 18kv and keep the metal shell of the rotating collector grounded in order to promote a stable potential difference between the tip and the collector adjust the speed of the rotating collector between 20 to 100 rpm according to the number of qq hb g to make the beads roll evenly inside the collector nanofibers were assembled on the surface of rolling beads under electrostatic attraction and the 3d electrospun nanofibers film covered on the beads as the outer layer of qq echb 2 4 visualization of qq bacteria distribution in beads to visualize the active bh4 within the qq echb syto 9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stains was used to labels all bacteria with intact membranes briefly the cross section of the beads is cut with a scalpel gaining in a circular slice about 0 5mm thick after incubated in syto 9 solution at a final concentration of 30μm at room temperature in dark for 15 minutes and rinses twice with deionized water observing directly under the confocal laser scanning microscope clsm a1 ti2 nikon japan at wavelengths of 480nm excitation and 500nm emission manteca et al 2005 2 5 evaluation of mechanical properties the compressive property and cyclic compression performance were considered as the mechanical strength of the beads tang et al 2021 the mechanical compression stress strain tests of single bead were evaluated by the uniaxial compression test employing an instron materials test system instron 5982 us equipped with a 50 n pressure sensor the force deformation curve of the bead was drawn from the beginning to the process of complete compression considering to evaluate the structural stability of beads under extreme physical scour the cyclic compression test was employed to describe the change of the compressive properties of beads after multiple high strength compression the mechanical stability of beads were evaluated by 100 successive loading unloading cycles 2 6 evaluation of the physical washing efficiency the contribution of qq echb to the mitigation of membrane biofouling is reflected in the qq activity and physical washing the physical washing effect of v echb vacant echb means echb not embedding qq bacteria and qq echb were assessed in the batch reactor 20 of every type of beads were placed in the batch reactor respectively in each batch reactor instead of using actual membrane module there were three pvdf coupons fixed on the internal surface of the container the batch reactors were operated with or without v echb at an aeration rate of 1 5l min and measure the contribution of physical washing in whole mitigation of biofouling properties by comparing with qq echb result after 24h aeration the pvdf coupons were taken out of the batch reactor and stained with 10ml 0 1 w v crystal violet cv and the floating color on the coupons was washed carefully with deionized water then dried for 24 h crystal violet on the coupons was dissolved in ethanol by separately immersing the coupons in 10 ml of ethanol solution for 30 min the concentration of cv in ethanol was measured using a spectrophotometer set at 570 nm the absorption value of three coupons from one reactor were averaged and defined as the formed biofilm mass 2 7 evaluation of qq activity qq activity of the beads was analyzed in terms of the degradation rate of commercial ahl c8 hsl sigma aldrich st louis mo a qs signal molecule in detail qq media prepared by fixing their number at 10 pieces were added

6 9 7 2 with a working volume of 5l were operated with same aeration intensity of 2l min the mlss and flux of mbrs was 5000 500 mg l and 24l m2 h activated sludge was taken from an urban wastewater treatment plant changsha china and acclimatized until the mbr operating parameters stabilized the hrt was 18h and there was no backflow and drained activated sludge during the experiment the composition of the synthetic wastewater in this experiment was as follows every 50l glucose 20g yeast extract 0 7g bactopeptone 5 75g nh4 2so4 5 25g kh2po4 1 0875g mgso4 0 7815g cacl2 0 1225g mnso4 0 09g and nahco3 12 8g and a little bit of fecl2 and cocl2 keeping the cod of the synthetic wastewater is around 400 500mg l the extent of biofouling in the mbrs was reflected by monitor the value of the transmembrane pressure tmp during the mbrs operation and the mbrs were stopped when the tmp reached 40 kpa the operated time was recorded to evaluate the anti biofouling performance of the mbrs ouyang et al 2020 membranes became fouled during operation were taken out of the reactor and soaked in 1000ppm of naocl for 3h to clean and reuse the fouled module lee et al 2016b the soluble extracellular products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps in the mixed liquor were extracted when the tmp of control mbr reached 40 kpa huang et al 2019a 2 9 analytical methods to show the efficient transfer of nutrients and signaling molecules between the interlayer of the beads we selected a marker to probe its mass transfer properties in beads with different layered structures evaluation of the mass transmissibility were carried out with 20 beads for each type immersed in 50ml 0 5mg l glucose solution experimental samples were withdrawn at interval time the remaining concentration of the glucose solution was measured by dns method investigation of the bacteria leakage of the beads was conducted by culturing the beads in a solid medium for 48h to observe rounding colony growth the smp is obtained by centrifuging the mixed liquor from the mbr at 8000 rpm for 15 minutes and filtering the supernatant through a 0 45μm millipore filter shi et al 2017 then a thermal extraction method was applied to the extraction of eps from the remaining sludge pellets yi et al 2022 yi et al 2023 the bound eps in the mixed liquor can be divided into loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps the polysaccharide and protein concentrations were measured as eps and smp concentrations using the phenol sulfuric acid method and the modified lowry method respectively gu et al 2018b huang et al 2019c mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and chemical oxygen demand cod were measured according to standard methods meantime fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and thermogravimetric analysis tga were employed to identify the functional group and compositions of the v echb to observe the microstructure of the layer of the beads the core shell beads were cut into half and treated by freeze dried and coated with a gold layer scanning electron microscopy sem was used to characterize the surface and cross sectional structure of the beads the pore size distribution of the es coating was measured using a pore size distribution instrument porometer3g quantachrome usa fang et al 2014 the membrane sample was cut into a round sample and moistened with the infiltrating fluid then vacuumed in a sealed environment promotes the discharge of the infiltrating fluid in the membrane pores software record the pore size distribution through the recorded vacuum pressure air flow curve and the washburn formula eq 1 1 d 4 γ cos θ p where p is the vacuum pressure γ is the surface tension of infiltrating liquid θ is the contact angle 3 results and discussion 3 1 3d interlayer structure of the qq echb to design an advanced multi layer qq media applying for mitigate membrane biofouling the interlayer structure of the qq echb needs to be investigated the pristine qq hb bead is opaque white whereas the dehydration treated qq hb g is translucent yellow for qq echb after being coated with a pvdf porous membrane by electrospinning the surface coating of the bead reflects a dense white coating fig 2 a and exhibits soft but robust after be stripped away from the hydrogel core fig s2 the surface and internal structures of the beads were characterized via sem using the freeze dried samples core of the bead with three different stage of treatment shows porous gel crosslinking structure with some wrinkles fig 2b for the surface layer of the qq echb a dense layer with a thickness of 5μm can be observed by sem under the cross section fig 2c when the surface layer is biofouling continued to observed at a vertical lens a 3d porous network covering the whole surface of the hydrogel sphere is revealed fig 2d g as the scanning magnification increases the stacked layered structure assembled of 100nm in diameter nanofiber was observed from the analysis of the pore diameter distribution of the 3d stacked layer it is found that the average pore diameter of this layer is 270nm fig s3 this pore size can effectively inhibit the leakage of bh4 bacteria 1 5μm kim et al 2013 immobilized in the core and continuously keep quorum quenching activity in the mbr furthermore ensuring that the membrane pore provides a channel unobstructed for soluble ion 0 1nm 1nm and macromolecular organic matter 2nm 30nm transfer 2005 guzenko et al 2017 in addition there was no chaotic beads generated in the process of electrospinning which reinforce the uniformity and continuity of the fiber structure 3 2 cell viability and distribution of the qq media to investigate the viability of bh4 cell during electrospinning coating clsm images of freshly prepared qq hb and qq echb were taken after viability staining in both type of qq media the bright green fluorescent area of bh4 appeared densely packed and evenly dispersed in the microstructure of the beads and indicates that the qq bacteria within the beads still maintain their cellular activity after electrospinning process in order to analyze the distribution of the bh4 cell at inner and surface of the bead in detail we compared the fluorescence distribution at different locations in the sample section fig 3 by analyzing the qq hb slice in fluorescent field and superimposed field we found that the active bacteria distributed uniformly from the edge of the hydrogel bead to the inner fig 3a b comparing with the qq echb in superimposed field the edge of the hydrogel is uniformly covered with a 5μm non fluorescent layer and we called it electrospinning coating layer ec layer to confirm the ec layer is independent of the hydrogel outer layer and without active bh4 cells the comparison of qq echb in fluorescent field and superimposed field was introduced the marked ec layer in fig 3d was not developed a fluorescent in fig 3c and a heterogeneous aqueous retaining layer caused by glycerol was visualized between the ec layer and core of the beads the above sem fig 2 and clsm fig 3 images indicated that a framework of 3d porous nanofiber membrane is successfully assembled on the outer layer of quorum quenching hydrogel beads qq hb by electrospinning physical pore diameter distribution and biological culture test fig s4 were used to verify the ability of the membrane to inhibit the microbial leakage the proliferation of the colony of different media proved that the robust electrospun coating shell can effectively inhibit the leakage of inner core qq bacteria compared to qq hb the results verified that the beads with coating reinforcement gained robust physical stability and environmental tolerance under harsh environmental conditions 3 3 chemical composition verification of the carrier investigation by ftir was performed to prove the synthesis of sa pva and pvdf in cell carrier v echb the infrared spectrum of the precursor materials were measured to grasp its characteristic peaks comparing to the infrared spectrum of the freeze dried v echb fig 4 as for sa the broad band at 3600 2800 cm 1 is linked to the stretching vibrations of oh groups and the small peaks at 2920 2850 cm 1 reflects the ch stretching of aliphatic groups the band at 1600 cm 1 can be ascribed to v coo asymmetric vibrations while the band at 1418 cm 1 to v coo symmetric vibrations which is the unique peak of sa compared with other materials as could be seen in fig 4 the absorption peak of neat pva at 3290 cm 1 were attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of oh bond which is also the only unique peak as compared with v echb the unique peak of pvdf at 841 cm 1 which is the stretching vibration of cf bond in summary the unique spectrum in the precursor materials are all reflected in the infrared spectrum of v echb indicating that all the precursors are involved in the construction of the chemical structure of v echb the tga and dta thermograms are present in fig 5 the weight loss in the first degradation stage from 100 c to 248 c can be attributed to the loss of diverse volatile compounds like free and bonded water the endothermic peak of the dta curve at 248 c reflects the weight change of tga curve begin to go in another stage from 248 c to 400 c a 70 dramatic mass decline which is ascribed to sa pva decrosslinking of the polymer network the formation of carbonaceous fractions and salts the melting and weight loss of remaining pvdf is confined to a single step degradation pattern around 450 c until the v echb is completely degraded around 525 c the tga and dta information of freeze dried samples proved that the three precursor materials were successfully combined in qq carrier v echb 3 4 tough 3d core shell framework enables robust physical stability and environmental tolerance we used compression testing to characterize the mechanical robustness of the hydrogel bacteria beads radius of 3 4 mm with varying shell layers fig 6 a we found that beads with an exposed hydrogel core could sustain almost 100 compressive strains and forces up to 13n until the failure of structure including qq hb and v hb we further improved the mechanical properties of the beads by fabricating a 3d nanofiber framework layer via electrospinning with beads that were coated with layer of tough pvdf electrospun coating qq echb we observe the bead is hard to compress and could sustain forces raise to 25n until 100 compressive strains which is equivalent to subjected to roughly twice the compressive stress of qq hb was suffered the bead capsules were also subjected to cyclic compression at 50 strain fig 6b with the 100 times cyclic compress within 6h qq echb sample shows only 11 reduction of strength in contrast the samples with exposed hydrogel core qq hb and v hb revealing a 46 8 and 32 2 reduction due to plastic deformation and energy dissipation we demonstrated the environmental tolerance of robust electrospun coating by placing 20 beads in 100ml nonpermissive liquid media and then measure the mass change of beads in stage fig 7 the hcl naoh and kh2po4 solutions with the concentration of 1m were selected as the test environment respectively represent excessive acid base and salt impact the results showed that mass change due to the swelling might be a potential challenge in the preliminary stage 0 1h but could be minimized by the robust electrospun coating therefore a lower rate of mass change of electrospun coating beads could be observed compared with the beads with an exposed hydrogel core none of one type of beads occurred obvious fragmentation or core disappearance after 4h of exposure 3 5 assessment of the physical washing efficiency of the carrier the qq echb not only can provide biological qq activity because it circulates all the time together with activated sludge under the aeration environment in a mbr for wastewater treatment but also it may reduce biofouling through collisions and removal of attached biocakes on a membrane surface physical washing to examine closely the physical washing contributes to the process of inhibiting membrane fouling batch experiment under aeration condition was carried out for 3 different types of beads v hb v echb qq echb at the same loading volume of 100ml of the bioreactor volume the reactors were run for 24h after which the pvdf coupons were taken out of each reactor and stained with crystal violet figure 8 shows the comparison of the physical washing effect between 3 types of beads the y axis represents the amount of biofilm formed derived from measuring the concentration of crystal violet which is proportional to the amount of biofilm attached to a pvdf coupons the statistical analysis showed that the conventional reactor having no physical washing as a result of a lack of mobile media had the highest amount of biofilm on the pvdf coupons whereas the reactor with v hb had the second highest amount of biofilm and the reactor with v echb had the similar amount of biofilm to v hb the reactor with qq echb had the lowest amount of biofilm despite the fact that the vacant beads without qq activity but also contributed to the inhibition of membrane biofouling the result is indicative of a little bit greater cleaning efficiency of v echb than v hb possibly as a result of the tougher shell layer of v echb with the bead surface because of their robust 3d electrospun coating in addition by comparing the difference of the inhibition degree of membrane biofouling between the qq echb and v echb it can be estimated that the proportion of physical washing in the overall inhibitory effect was about 38 by dividing the values of the difference between the control and v echb groups 0 235 od590 and the difference between the control and qq echb groups 0 608 od590 therefore the qq activity is the key process to inhibit membrane pollution 3 6 quorum quenching activity of free bh4 and qq media the quorum quenching activity of free bh4 and qq media was tested using lc ms with c8 hsl n octanoyl dl homoserine lactone which is most abundant in the biofilm formed membranes in mbr as shown in fig 9 the initial concentration of c8 hsl is 200ng ml live bh4 readily degraded c8 hsl to a low concentration within 4h and was leveled off after 8 hours qq echb degraded 87 5 of c8 hsl within 20h and stabilized at 92 5 in 24h whereas the v echb removed less than 8 of the c8 hsl in 24h the comparison verified that quorum quenching bacteria played a major role in degradation of ahl and the removal by v echb was attributed to its physicochemical adsorption because vacant beads have neither quorum quenching bacteria nor quorum quenching enzyme by comparing the qq activity of qq echb and qq hb g we found that the qq echb with an electrospun 3d coating would lead to a pronounced quorum quenching hysteresis due to the sustained release effect of the robust porous shell on mass transfer in the early stage the swelling of the beads and the activation of the quorum quenching bacteria would postpone to a period of time it also provides a buffer for the quorum quenching bacteria to adapt to the sewage environment nutrients transmissibility experiment by glucose adsorption also proved the penetrability and hysteresis of 3d porous coating the qq hb without the robust porous shell will reach the glucose adsorption equilibrium in advance compared with qq echb fig s5 3 7 application of qq echb to the mbr to evaluate the ability of qq echb to inhibit membrane biofouling and prolong membrane cleaning cycles in mbr tmp rise up was monitored in reactor a and b with different applied media and the profiles of such are shown in fig 10 the sludge in the two reactors was acclimated to the same state svi 85 90ml g and operated in conventional mode for two weeks before starting record the regulation operations reactor a was operated with the addition of qq echb at a dosage of 10g beads 5l mbr and the tmp rise up was monitored reactor b was operated in conventional mode for 3 periods in the first phase meaning no media was added in the second phase of the rector b v echb were added for 3 periods to verify the contribution of physical washing on the inhibition of membrane biofouling every single period ends when the tmp reaching 40kpa regarded the membrane was completely fouled the reactor a in the first period with the addition of qq echb was operated for 16 days to reach the ending tmp after cleaned the membrane module the second period of reactor a also maintained 18 days until completely fouled compared to the membrane module of conventional mode in reactor a phase 1 was just in an average of 4 days to reach completely fouled in every period the comparison indicated that the qq echb can effectively extended the mbr service life nearly 4 times which verifies the strong mitigation ability of qq echb on mbr biofouling in reactor b phase 2 v echb were added and extended the time for membrane completely fouled to 8 days which was attributed to the physical washing by the vacant beads the days of completely fouled for v echb and qq echb were 8 days and 16 days respectively because the number of beads added in both reactors was the same and hence it could be assumed that the physical washing effect in the two reactors was the same the difference biofouling process is likely attributable to the greater qq activity of qq echb than of v echb in further comparison with data of previous studies table 1 qq echb performs longer days to reach the ending tmp than qq hb and the beads covered with the ec layer retain their structure complete and robust at the end of a mbr cycle due to the ec layer to inhibit bacteria leakage and to protect the hydrogel core from environmental impact we also demonstrated this view by comparing the fluorescence intensity of clsm of the two materials fig s8 qq echb had higher bacteria count and cell viability than qq hb after use when the mbr was stopped the protein pn and polysaccharide ps of soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymers eps in activated sludge were measured pn and ps in eps and smp concentrations in both qq echb mbr were always lower than those in v echb mbr and control mbr for smp loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps the mean concentration in qq echb mbr at different periods were 10 4 5 and 25 lower than in v echb mbr and 29 11 and 32 lower than in vacant mbr meanwhile the change of protein make up the bulk fig s6 the improvement in eps and smp reduction led to enhanced biofouling control in the mbr with qq echb in summary the mbr with qq echb was approximately 4 times less prone to membrane fouling compared to the conventional mbr that without media the 3d core shell framework of the qq echb enhances the overall physical strength and protects the durable activity of the quorum quenching bacteria fig s7 the qq activity of qq echb is characterized by slow initiation and long duration it was activated for 3 days and maintained at least 95 qq activity for 16 days over a mbr cycle and one of another notable features of qq echb is the ability to continue to mitigate membrane biofouling in mbr even at very low dosage levels 4 conclusions in this research by comparing to other studies qq echb were more efficient in dosing due to its ability to maintain stable qq bacteria activity and provide long lasting quorum quenching effects these factors contribute to its satisfactory overall performance the electrospun nanofiber coating of the hydrogel beads with excellent encapsulation and mass transfer performance this is a breakthrough in our research on the enhancing of hydrogel materials for water treatment which not only provides a more robust and stable carrier for mitigating the mbr membrane biofouling of the external media but also provides inspiration for the application of advanced hydrogel materials in other fields like tissue engineering food engineering and chemical industry electrospinning is a widely adopted additive manufacturing and processing solution with the emerging of large scale production lines there has been a growing trend towards using this technology to produce high performance materials in bulk this research represents a significant step in exploring the industrial production of membrane biofouling inhibitors we have used an automated hydrogel preparation device and a self developed electrospinning receiver both of which have significant potential for scale up in the future we aim to increase the material yield while functionalizing the membrane layer and microorganism enhance quorum quenching with more

14939,bacterial quorum quenching qq is an effective strategy for controlling biofouling in membrane bioreactor mbr by interfering the releasing and degradation of signal molecules during quorum sensing qs process however due to the framework feature of qq media the maintenance of qq activity and the restriction of mass transfer threshold it has been difficult to design a more stable and better performing structure in a long period of time in this research electrospun fiber coated hydrogel qq beads qq echb were fabricated by using electrospun nanofiber coated hydrogel to strengthen

gu et al 2018a ma et al 2018 since the presence of mbr technology the bottleneck of membrane biofouling has been restricting this technology and it is also motivating the reform and innovation of this technology bagheri and mirbagheri 2018 drews 2010 meng et al 2009 quorum sensing qs was found to be a phenomenon that bacteria regulate their behaviors in groups such as virulence and biofilm

carriers shah et al 2022 among a series of spherical fiber tube plate frame structure and layer by layer lbl structures we found that free moving millimeter scale qq beads are the most reasonable carrier structure for controlling mbr biofouling for their shape and size can free moving in the aeration environment and scouring the surface of the fiber yu et al 2019 concurrently the entrapped qq bacteria can inhibit the biofouling of the fiber surface by quorum quenching effect kim et al 2013 however since the appearance of qq beads the structure of beads is usually constructed by gel cross linking or multi layer gel cross linking combined with phase transformation so in these research the qq colony was either exposed to an opening environment connected to the external water environment or barred in a closed system with an outer layer constructed by phase inversion making potential impacts on the continued quorum quenching or maintaining the integrity and stability of the structure of the beads a 3d structure membrane typically has a complex porous architecture that allows for high permeability and selectivity the interconnected pores and channels in the membrane provide a large

crystalline fluorocarbon polymer with excellent chemical resistance thermal and mechanical properties and have facile and mature membrane forming process we chose it as the ideal material for electrospinning kang and cao 2014 liang et al 2021 liu et al 2011 here a robust 3d porous protective membrane was deposited on the surface of gel beads embedded with rhodococcus sp bh4 strain by using a self made es rotating collector this outer membrane layer of qq beads has excellent elasticity and resistance to physical scour and chemical shock which can protect the core of the beads maintains a complete structure under long term hydraulic erosion and aeration and keep the swelling of the gel core under control huang et al 2018 in addition the porous construction support the core of the beads to exchange materials with the external environment feeding and metabolism of qq bacteria the feasible pore size inhibits the escape of the inner core bacteria keep the qq beads continue to exert the quorum quenching effect and stable physical washing 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of qq hb for preparation of qq hb rhodococcus sp bh4 was used as the qq bacteria because it has the capacity

hour stabilization 2 2 pretreatment of qq hb inspired by cryoprotectants cpas used in the inhibition of the icing of water in biological samples chen et al 2018 zhu et al 2021 glycerol was used to displacing water molecules within the surface of the qq hb briefly the original qq hb were immersed in a glycerol solution for 20min to generate the glycerol based tough hydrogel we called qq hb g 2 3 assembly of qq echb the 10 wt pvdf polymer dope solution was prepared by dissolving pvdf mw 400 000 dupont usa in a mixture of dmf ar mclean biochemical technolog china and acetone ar mclean biochemical technolog china at a volume ratio of 7 3 more specifically the preparation of qq echb from qq hb g is as follows fig 1 the qq hb g were placed in a self made metal hemispherical rotating

following conditions dope solution feeding rate of 3ml h tip to center of rotating collector distance of 10cm positive voltage of 18kv and keep the metal shell of the rotating collector grounded in order to promote a stable potential difference between the tip and the collector adjust the speed of the rotating collector between 20 to 100 rpm according to the number of qq hb g to make the beads roll evenly inside the collector nanofibers were assembled on the surface of rolling beads under electrostatic attraction and the 3d electrospun nanofibers film covered on the beads as the outer layer of qq echb 2 4 visualization of qq bacteria distribution in beads to visualize the active bh4 within the qq echb syto 9 green fluorescent nucleic acid stains was used to labels all bacteria with intact membranes briefly the cross section of the beads is cut with a scalpel gaining in a circular slice about 0 5mm thick after incubated in syto 9 solution at a final concentration of 30μm at room temperature in dark for 15 minutes and rinses twice with deionized water observing directly under the confocal laser scanning microscope clsm a1 ti2 nikon japan at wavelengths of 480nm excitation and 500nm emission manteca et al 2005 2 5 evaluation of mechanical properties the compressive property and cyclic compression performance were considered as the mechanical strength of the beads tang et al 2021 the mechanical compression stress strain tests of single bead were evaluated by the uniaxial compression test employing an instron materials test system instron 5982 us equipped with a 50 n pressure sensor the force deformation curve of the bead was drawn from the beginning to the process of complete compression considering to evaluate the structural stability of beads under extreme physical scour the cyclic compression test was employed to describe the change of the compressive properties of beads after multiple high strength compression the mechanical stability of beads were evaluated by 100 successive loading unloading cycles 2 6 evaluation of the physical washing efficiency the contribution of qq echb to the mitigation of membrane biofouling is reflected in the qq activity and physical washing the physical washing effect of v echb vacant echb means echb not embedding qq bacteria and qq echb were assessed in the batch reactor 20 of every type of beads were placed in the batch reactor respectively in each batch reactor instead of using actual membrane module there were three pvdf coupons fixed on the internal surface of the container the batch reactors were operated with or without v echb at an aeration rate of 1 5l min and measure the contribution of physical washing in whole mitigation of biofouling properties by comparing with qq echb result after 24h aeration the pvdf coupons were taken out of the batch reactor and stained with 10ml 0 1 w v crystal violet cv and the floating color on the coupons was washed carefully with deionized water then dried for 24 h crystal violet on the coupons was dissolved in ethanol by separately immersing the coupons in 10 ml of ethanol solution for 30 min the concentration of cv in ethanol was measured using a spectrophotometer set at 570 nm the absorption value of three coupons from one reactor were averaged and defined as the formed biofilm mass 2 7 evaluation of qq activity qq activity of the

6 9 7 2 with a working volume of 5l were operated with same aeration intensity of 2l min the mlss and flux of mbrs was 5000 500 mg l and 24l m2 h activated sludge was taken from an urban wastewater treatment plant changsha china and acclimatized until the mbr operating parameters stabilized the hrt was 18h and there was no backflow and drained activated sludge during the experiment the composition of the synthetic wastewater in this experiment was as follows every 50l glucose 20g yeast extract 0 7g bactopeptone 5 75g nh4 2so4 5 25g kh2po4 1 0875g mgso4 0 7815g cacl2 0 1225g mnso4 0 09g and nahco3 12 8g and a little bit of fecl2 and cocl2 keeping the cod of the synthetic wastewater is around 400 500mg l the extent of biofouling in the mbrs was reflected by monitor the value of the transmembrane pressure tmp during the mbrs operation and the mbrs were stopped when the tmp reached 40 kpa the operated time was recorded to evaluate the anti biofouling performance of the mbrs ouyang et al 2020 membranes became fouled during operation were taken out of the reactor and soaked in 1000ppm of naocl for 3h to clean and reuse the fouled module lee et al 2016b the soluble extracellular products smp and extracellular polymeric substances eps in the mixed liquor were extracted when the tmp of control mbr reached 40 kpa huang et al 2019a 2 9 analytical methods to show the efficient transfer of nutrients and signaling molecules between the interlayer of the beads we selected a marker to probe its mass transfer properties in beads with different layered structures evaluation of the mass transmissibility were carried out with 20 beads for each type immersed in 50ml 0 5mg l glucose solution experimental samples were withdrawn at interval time the remaining concentration of the glucose solution was measured by dns method investigation of the bacteria leakage of the beads was conducted by culturing the beads in a solid medium for 48h to observe rounding colony growth the smp is obtained by centrifuging the mixed liquor from the mbr at 8000 rpm for 15 minutes and filtering the supernatant through a 0 45μm millipore filter shi et al 2017 then a thermal extraction method was applied to the extraction of eps from the remaining sludge pellets yi et al 2022 yi et al 2023 the bound eps in the mixed liquor can be divided into loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps the polysaccharide and protein concentrations were measured as eps and smp concentrations using the phenol sulfuric acid method and the modified lowry method respectively gu et al 2018b huang et al 2019c mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and chemical oxygen demand cod were measured according to standard methods meantime fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and thermogravimetric analysis tga were employed to identify the functional group and compositions of the v echb to observe the microstructure of the layer of the beads the core shell beads were cut into half and treated by freeze dried and coated with a gold layer scanning electron microscopy sem was used to characterize the surface and cross sectional structure of the beads the pore size distribution of the es coating was measured using a pore size distribution instrument porometer3g quantachrome usa fang et al 2014 the membrane sample was cut into a round sample and moistened with the infiltrating fluid then vacuumed in a sealed environment promotes the discharge of the infiltrating fluid in the membrane pores software record the pore size distribution through the recorded vacuum pressure air flow curve and the washburn formula eq 1 1 d 4 γ cos θ p where p is the vacuum pressure γ is the surface tension of infiltrating liquid θ is the contact angle 3 results and discussion 3 1 3d interlayer structure of the qq echb to design an advanced multi layer qq media applying for mitigate membrane biofouling the interlayer structure of the qq echb needs to be investigated the pristine qq hb bead is opaque white whereas the dehydration treated qq hb g is translucent yellow for qq echb after being coated with a pvdf porous membrane by electrospinning the surface coating of the bead reflects a dense white coating fig 2 a and exhibits soft but robust after be stripped away from the hydrogel core fig s2 the surface and internal structures of the beads were characterized via sem using the freeze dried samples core of the bead with three different stage of treatment shows porous gel crosslinking structure with some wrinkles fig 2b for the surface layer of the qq echb a dense layer with a thickness of 5μm can be observed by sem under the cross section fig 2c when the surface layer is biofouling continued to observed at a vertical lens a 3d porous network covering the whole surface of the hydrogel sphere is revealed fig 2d g as the scanning magnification increases the stacked layered structure assembled of 100nm in diameter nanofiber was observed from the analysis of the pore diameter distribution of the 3d stacked layer it is found that the average pore diameter of this layer is 270nm fig s3 this pore size can effectively inhibit the leakage of bh4 bacteria 1 5μm kim et al 2013 immobilized in the core and continuously keep quorum quenching activity in the mbr furthermore ensuring that the membrane pore provides a channel unobstructed for soluble ion 0 1nm 1nm and macromolecular organic matter 2nm 30nm transfer 2005 guzenko et al 2017 in addition there was no chaotic beads generated in the process of electrospinning which reinforce the uniformity and continuity of the fiber structure 3 2 cell viability and distribution of the qq media to investigate the viability of bh4 cell during electrospinning coating clsm images of freshly prepared qq hb and qq echb were taken after viability staining in both type of qq media the bright green fluorescent area of bh4 appeared densely packed and evenly dispersed in the microstructure of the beads and indicates that the qq bacteria within the beads still maintain their cellular activity after electrospinning process in order to analyze the distribution of the bh4 cell at inner and surface of the bead in detail we compared the fluorescence distribution at different locations in the sample section fig 3 by analyzing the qq hb slice in fluorescent field and superimposed field we found that the active bacteria distributed uniformly from the edge of the hydrogel bead to the inner fig 3a b comparing with the qq echb in superimposed field the edge of the hydrogel is uniformly covered with a 5μm non fluorescent layer and we called it electrospinning coating layer ec layer to confirm the ec layer is independent of the hydrogel outer layer and without active bh4 cells the comparison of qq echb in fluorescent field and superimposed field was introduced the marked ec layer in fig 3d was not developed a fluorescent in fig 3c and a heterogeneous aqueous retaining layer caused by glycerol was visualized between the ec layer and core of the beads the above sem fig 2 and clsm fig 3 images indicated that a framework of 3d porous nanofiber membrane is successfully assembled on the outer layer of quorum quenching hydrogel beads qq hb by electrospinning physical pore diameter distribution and biological culture test fig s4 were used to verify the ability of the membrane to inhibit the microbial leakage the proliferation of the colony of different media proved that the robust electrospun coating shell can effectively inhibit the leakage of inner core qq bacteria compared to qq hb the results verified that the beads with coating reinforcement gained robust physical stability and environmental tolerance under harsh environmental conditions 3 3 chemical composition verification of the carrier investigation by ftir was performed to prove the synthesis of sa pva and pvdf in cell carrier v echb the infrared spectrum of the precursor materials were measured to grasp its characteristic peaks comparing to the infrared spectrum of the freeze dried v echb fig 4 as for sa the broad band at 3600 2800 cm 1 is linked to the stretching vibrations of oh groups and the small peaks at 2920 2850 cm 1 reflects the ch stretching of aliphatic groups the band at 1600 cm 1 can be ascribed to v coo asymmetric vibrations while the band at 1418 cm 1 to v coo symmetric vibrations which is the unique peak of sa compared with other materials as could be seen in fig 4 the absorption peak of neat pva at 3290 cm 1 were attributed to the asymmetric stretching vibration of oh bond which is also the only unique peak as compared with v echb the unique peak of pvdf at 841 cm 1 which is the stretching vibration of cf bond in summary the unique spectrum in the precursor materials are all reflected in the infrared spectrum of v echb indicating that all the precursors are involved in the construction of the chemical structure of v echb the tga and dta thermograms are present in fig 5 the weight loss in the first degradation stage from 100 c to 248 c can be attributed to the loss of diverse volatile compounds like free and bonded water the endothermic peak of the dta curve at 248 c reflects the weight change of tga curve begin to go in another stage from 248 c to 400 c a 70 dramatic mass decline which is ascribed to sa pva decrosslinking of the polymer network the formation of carbonaceous fractions and salts the melting and weight loss of remaining pvdf is confined to a single step degradation pattern around 450 c until the v echb is completely degraded around 525 c the tga and dta information of freeze dried samples proved that the three precursor materials were successfully combined in qq carrier v echb 3 4 tough 3d core shell framework enables robust physical stability and environmental tolerance we used compression testing to characterize the mechanical robustness of the hydrogel bacteria beads radius of 3 4 mm with varying shell layers fig 6 a we found that beads with an exposed hydrogel core could sustain almost 100 compressive strains and forces up to 13n until the failure of structure including qq hb and v hb we further improved the mechanical properties of the beads by fabricating a 3d nanofiber framework layer via electrospinning with beads that were coated with layer of tough pvdf electrospun coating qq echb we observe the bead is hard to compress and could sustain forces raise to 25n until 100 compressive strains which is equivalent to subjected to roughly twice the compressive stress of qq hb was suffered the bead capsules were also subjected to cyclic compression at 50 strain fig 6b with the 100 times cyclic compress within 6h qq echb sample shows only 11 reduction of strength in contrast the samples with exposed hydrogel core qq hb and v hb revealing a 46 8 and 32 2 reduction due to plastic deformation and energy dissipation we demonstrated the environmental tolerance of robust electrospun coating by placing 20 beads in 100ml nonpermissive liquid media and then measure the mass change of beads in stage fig 7 the hcl naoh and kh2po4 solutions with the concentration of 1m were selected as the test environment respectively represent excessive acid base and salt impact the results showed that mass change due to the swelling might be a potential challenge in the preliminary stage 0 1h but could be minimized by the robust electrospun coating therefore a lower rate of mass change of electrospun coating beads could be observed compared with the beads with an exposed hydrogel core none of one type of beads occurred obvious fragmentation or core disappearance after 4h of exposure 3 5 assessment of the physical washing efficiency of the carrier the qq echb not only can provide biological qq activity because it circulates all the time together with activated sludge under the aeration environment in a mbr for wastewater treatment but also it may reduce biofouling through collisions and removal of attached biocakes on a membrane surface physical washing to examine closely the physical washing contributes to the process of inhibiting membrane fouling batch experiment under aeration condition was carried out for 3 different types of beads v hb v echb qq echb at the same loading volume of 100ml of the bioreactor volume the reactors were run for 24h after which the pvdf coupons were taken out of each reactor and stained with crystal violet figure 8 shows the comparison of the physical washing effect between 3 types of beads the y axis represents the amount of biofilm formed derived from measuring the concentration of crystal violet which is proportional to the amount of biofilm attached to a pvdf coupons the statistical analysis showed that the conventional reactor having no physical washing as a result of a lack of mobile media had the highest amount of biofilm on the pvdf coupons whereas the reactor with v hb had the second highest amount of biofilm and the reactor with v echb had the similar amount of biofilm to v hb the reactor with qq echb had the lowest amount of biofilm despite the fact that the vacant beads without qq activity but also contributed to the inhibition of membrane biofouling the result is indicative of a little bit greater cleaning efficiency of v echb than v hb possibly as a result of the tougher shell layer of v echb with the bead surface because of their robust 3d electrospun coating in addition by comparing the difference of the inhibition degree of membrane biofouling between the qq echb and v echb it can be estimated that the proportion of physical washing in the overall inhibitory effect was about 38 by dividing the values of the difference between the control and v echb groups 0 235 od590 and the difference between the control and qq echb groups 0 608 od590 therefore the qq activity is the key process to inhibit membrane pollution 3 6 quorum quenching activity of free bh4 and qq media the quorum quenching activity of free bh4 and qq media was tested using lc ms with c8 hsl n octanoyl dl homoserine lactone which is most abundant in the biofilm formed membranes in mbr as shown in fig 9 the initial concentration of c8 hsl is 200ng ml live bh4 readily degraded c8 hsl to a low concentration within 4h and was leveled off after 8 hours qq echb degraded 87 5 of c8 hsl within 20h and stabilized at 92 5 in 24h whereas the v echb removed less than 8 of the c8 hsl in 24h the comparison verified that quorum quenching bacteria played a major role in degradation of ahl and the removal by v echb was attributed to its physicochemical adsorption because vacant beads have neither quorum quenching bacteria nor quorum quenching enzyme by comparing the qq activity of qq echb and qq hb g we found that the qq echb with an electrospun 3d coating would lead to a pronounced quorum quenching hysteresis due to the sustained release effect of the robust porous shell on mass transfer in the early stage the swelling of the beads and the activation of the quorum quenching bacteria would postpone to a period of time it also provides a buffer for the quorum quenching bacteria to adapt to the sewage environment nutrients transmissibility experiment by glucose adsorption also proved the penetrability and hysteresis of 3d porous coating the qq hb without the robust porous shell will reach the glucose adsorption equilibrium in advance compared with qq echb fig s5 3 7 application of qq echb to the mbr to evaluate the ability of qq echb to inhibit membrane biofouling and prolong membrane cleaning cycles in mbr tmp rise up was monitored in reactor a and b with different applied media and the profiles of such are shown in fig 10 the sludge in the two reactors was acclimated to the same state svi 85 90ml g and operated in conventional mode for two weeks before starting record the regulation operations reactor a was operated with the addition of qq echb at a dosage of 10g beads 5l mbr and the tmp rise up was monitored reactor b was operated in conventional mode for 3 periods in the first phase meaning no media was added in the second phase of the rector b v echb were added for 3 periods to verify the contribution of physical washing on the inhibition of membrane biofouling every single period ends when the tmp reaching 40kpa regarded the membrane was completely fouled the reactor a in the first period with the addition of qq echb was operated for 16 days to reach the ending tmp after cleaned the membrane module the second period of reactor a also maintained 18 days until completely fouled compared to the membrane module of conventional mode in reactor a phase 1 was just in an average of 4 days to reach completely fouled in every period the comparison indicated that the qq echb can effectively extended the mbr service life nearly 4 times which verifies the strong mitigation ability of qq echb on mbr biofouling in reactor b phase 2 v echb were added and extended the time for membrane completely fouled to 8 days which was attributed to the physical washing by the vacant beads the days of completely fouled for v echb and qq echb were 8 days and 16 days respectively because the number of beads added in both reactors was the same and hence it could be assumed that the physical washing effect in the two reactors was the same the difference biofouling process is likely attributable to the greater qq activity of qq echb than of v echb in further comparison with data of previous studies table 1 qq echb performs longer days to reach the ending tmp than qq hb and the beads covered with the ec layer retain their structure complete and robust at the end of a mbr cycle due to the ec layer to inhibit bacteria leakage and to protect the hydrogel core from environmental impact we also demonstrated this view by comparing the fluorescence intensity of clsm of the two materials fig s8 qq echb had higher bacteria count and cell viability than qq hb after use when the mbr was stopped the protein pn and polysaccharide ps of soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymers eps in activated sludge were measured pn and ps in eps and smp concentrations in both qq echb mbr were always lower than those in v echb mbr and control mbr for smp loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps the mean concentration in qq echb mbr at different periods were 10 4 5 and 25 lower than in v echb mbr and 29 11 and 32 lower than in vacant mbr meanwhile the change of protein make up the bulk fig s6 the improvement in eps and smp reduction led to enhanced biofouling control in the mbr with qq echb in summary the mbr with qq echb was approximately 4 times less prone to membrane fouling compared to the conventional mbr that without media the 3d core shell framework of the qq echb enhances the overall physical strength and protects the durable activity of the quorum quenching bacteria fig s7 the qq activity of qq echb is characterized by slow initiation and long duration it was activated for 3 days and maintained at least 95 qq activity for 16 days over a mbr cycle and one of another notable features of qq echb is the ability to continue to mitigate membrane biofouling in mbr even at very low dosage levels 4 conclusions in this research by comparing to other studies qq echb were more efficient in dosing due to its ability to maintain stable qq bacteria activity and provide long lasting quorum quenching effects these factors contribute to its satisfactory overall performance the electrospun nanofiber coating of the hydrogel beads with excellent encapsulation and mass transfer performance this is a breakthrough in our research on the enhancing of hydrogel materials for water treatment which not only provides a more robust and stable carrier for mitigating the mbr membrane biofouling of the external media but also provides inspiration for the application of advanced hydrogel materials in other fields like tissue engineering food engineering and chemical industry electrospinning is a widely adopted additive manufacturing and processing solution with the emerging of large scale production lines there has been a growing trend towards using this technology to produce high performance materials in bulk this research represents a significant step in exploring the industrial production of membrane biofouling inhibitors we have used an automated hydrogel preparation device and a self developed electrospinning receiver both of which have significant potential for scale up in the future we aim to increase the material yield while functionalizing the membrane layer and microorganism enhance quorum quenching with more
