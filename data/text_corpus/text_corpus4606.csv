23030,plate anchors are commonly used in mooring systems of offshore facilities for gas and oil production in deep and ultra deep water they may encounter hydrate bearing sediments widespread in marine continental margins the pullout capacity of square anchors embedded shallowly in a hydrate bearing sand is investigated with small scale model tests using tetrahydrofuran thf hydrate as the substitute of gas hydrate the results show that the pullout capacity of the anchors increases with the increase of the anchor width and the burial depth the pullout capacity of the anchors can be estimated by a dimensionless breakout factor this factor increases with the increase of the burial depth ratio defined as the ratio of the burial depth to the width of a plate anchor exhibiting a trend similar to that obtained numerically and experimentally from plate anchors shallowly embedded in undrained clays hydrate dissociation brings detrimental effects on the pullout capacity of the anchors the pullout capacity of the anchors drops to 0 3 of the initial value after the hydrates dissociate this pronounced reduction highlights the need for further investigation on the effect of oceanic hydrate dissociation on engineering performance of offshore facilities as a result of natural or anthropologic perturbation keywords pullout capacity plate anchor gas hydrate physical model test floating offshore platform 1 introduction as the oil and gas industry increasingly produces from deep water and hash environments due to world s escalating demands for hydrocarbons offshore facilities face two geotechnical engineering challenges first more elaborate floating offshore platforms require innovative and economic anchoring foundation systems that transmit immense pullout forces to the ocean bed among the numerous anchoring systems such as suction caissons suction embedded or dragged in plate anchors and dynamically embedded torpedo anchors randolph et al 2011 plate type anchors continue to be widely used because of their high capacity to weight ratios the second challenge is that these anchoring systems must work under a wide range of deep water soil conditions such as soft fine grained sediments either clay or in some regions carbonate muds and silts and methane hydrate mh bearing sediments mhs are combustible crystalline compounds encaging methane molecules inside a water molecule lattice they attract global research interests as a potential energy source for the massive quantities of reserves moridis et al 2011 mhs are rather widespread in marine sediments where the temperature and pressure enable stable presence of hydrates in particular mhs are extensively found in outer continental margins with water depth more than 500 m kvenvolden and lorenson 2001 and thus deep water anchoring systems encountering mh oceanic reservoirs are expected to be common this raises questions regarding engineering performance of anchoring systems in such mh environments as suggested by many experimental studies the presence of mhs significantly alters mechanical behaviours of the host sediments in terms of stiffness strength and dilation whilst the dissociation of mhs as a result of salinity temperature or and pressure change arising from natural or anthropologic perturbations could induce remarkable decay of strength in the host sediments kwon et al 2008 2010 2013 therefore the complex properties of mh bearing sediments have considerable impacts on the pullout capacity of the anchoring systems that interact with mh bearing sediments the pullout capacity of plate type anchors has been investigated with various approaches in early studies theoretical predictions were formulated through limit equilibrium analyses or limit analyses based on assumed or observed shapes of failure surfaces murray and geddes 1989 rao and kumar 1994 these theories were later improved by using more sophisticated constitutive models for soils ardebili et al 2016 and more rigorous numerical methods for instance the numerical limit analysis merifield et al 2006 2001 the large deformation finite element method wang et al 2013 2010 and the material point method coetzee et al 2005 in addition physical model tests performed either under natural gravity 1 g or in centrifuges provides a means to study anchors under carefully controlled and monitored conditions centrifuge testing is capable of scaling the stresses in the model to represent full scale conditions but reproducing the stress pressure temperature conditions of mhs at seabed in a centrifuge environment is extremely difficult and often proves problematic zhang et al 2015a alternatively small scale 1 g model testing is extensively used to calibrate and validate numerical models thanks to simple equipment requirement great flexibility and low cost chow et al 2015 das 1995 1978 ilamparuthi et al 2002 ilamparuthi and muthukrishnaiah 1999 even though the stress condition does not represent realistic seabed conditions the scaling error can be reduced by presenting results in dimensionless forms and using model soils with constitutive responses similar to the prototype soils bradshaw et al 2017 most studies regardless of the approaches employed express the anchor s pullout capacity in terms of a dimensionless breakout factor this factor increases with an increase in embedment depth until it becomes constant beyond a critical embedment depth indicating a transition from shallow anchor behaviour to deep anchor behaviour in addition to the anchor embedment and geometry various soil conditions have been examined such as sands of various densities and clays with uniform strength thorne et al 2004 and linearly increasing strength khatri and kumar 2009 tho et al 2014 yu et al 2015 however plate type anchors performance in mh bearing sediments remains to be experimentally examined we investigate the pullout capacity of square anchors shallowly embedded in hydrate bearing sandy sediments by using small scale 1 g physical model tests the pullout tests are conducted on anchors with various widths embedded at different depths the breakout factor obtained from this study is compared with available numerical and experimental results obtained from conventional soil conditions the effect of hydrate dissociation on the pullout capacity of the anchors is also examined by conducting anchor pullout tests after the hydrates in the soil experience thermal dissociation we recognize that it is practically difficult to accurately reproduce field seabed conditions in small 1 g models however these models can offer insight into weakening of structures interacting with soils bearing dissociated hydrates and provide data obtained from well controlled conditions to calibrate numerical codes for hydrate related problems e g kimoto et al 2010 rutqvist 2011 the learned knowledge and the calibrated numerical models can in turn be used for real field conditions in other words the objective of the current study is to fulfil the first step in this two step methodology 2 experimental details 2 1 equipment and model set up as shown in fig 1 this study was conducted in a chamber open to the ambient atmosphere the inside dimensions of the chamber are 1400 mm 400 mm 390 mm length width height the chamber is equipped with a built in bath cooler that enables the lowest temperature of 7 c a specially designed loading frame is placed above the chamber in order to provide uplift and lateral forces via an electronic actuator to the model anchors embedded in the soil bed the model anchors are 5 mm thick square steel plates with various plate widths i e 30 mm 45 mm and 60 mm each plate is rigidly connected to a threaded steel rod 10 mm in diameter pulled by the actuator through a steel string the forces applied on the anchors are measured by a load cell and the displacement of the anchors is measured from the upward movement of the actuator considering the fact that the deformation of steel string is negligible a few tenth of mm under the highest load compared to the total displacement ranging 8 20 mm required to mobilize the peak capacity the host soil of hydrates used in our study is a silty sand that mimics typical soils from the shallow layer of the south china sea liu et al 2012 the fine fraction of the sand i e the percent in mass passing no 200 75 Î¼m sieve is 15 6 the particle size distribution curve of the sand is presented in fig 3 compared with the one obtained from an in situ core sample of hydrate bearing soils at the south china sea liu et al 2012 our laboratory equipment does not allow forming mhs under atmospheric pressure since the temperature required below 80 c sloan 1998 is beyond the capacity of our available cooler as a substitute we used tetrahydrofuran thf hydrates to prepare hydrate bearing soil specimens in the chamber thf hydrates have been adopted as a satisfactory substitute for mhs in many successful physical model tests zhang et al 2015a b 2016 owing to their similarity in mechanical and thermal properties lee et al 2007 yun et al 2007 to mhs in addition a large volume of thf hydrate bearing sediments can be prepared more uniformly and safely than synthesized mh bearing sediments since thf is completely miscible with water in all proportions and forms hydrates under atmospheric pressure at a temperature below 4 4 c we investigated the performance of the anchors under two soil conditions 1 the hydrate case in which the soil hosts hydrates in 85 saturation i e 85 of the void space filled with hydrates and the remaining void space filled with air in order to eliminate effect of ice and 2 the hydrate free case in which the hydrate bearing soil has completely dissociated the hydrate saturation degree 85 was selected here to represent the conditions of a highly concentrated hydrate reservoir possible in the south china sea where the hydrate saturation degree ranges up to 90 qian et al 2017 pore water in the soil would be problematic as it could freeze into ice under our test conditions and make it difficult to interpret the effects of hydrates as well as its dissociation on anchors bearing capacity to avoid this complexity we picked the thf to water mass ratio 19 81 so that all fluid is consumed in forming the hydrates and no free water would be available to form ice table 1 summarizes three series of tests i e s1 s2 s3 each containing three pullout runs in order to take full advantage of the elongated chamber series s1 and s2 were conducted on vertically loaded anchors buried in hydrate bearing soil for examining the effects of the burial depth and the sizes of anchors in series s3 the first run was a replicate test of the hydrate bearing case to check data reliability whereas the second and third runs were conducted after thermal dissociation of hydrates in order to investigate the performance of the anchors in soil with dissociated hydrates fig 2 illustrates the model set up of series s1 as an example the soil bed is 155 mm thick burying three identical 30 mm wide anchors at depths of 30 60 and 90 mm respectively the model dimensions are chosen in such a way that 1 the chamber boundaries do not impact the breakout cones mobilized in the soil failure mechanism and 2 the cones do not interfere with each other the set ups of series s2 and s3 are similar except that a plate heater is buried at 50 mm below the second and third anchors in series s3 to facilitate thermal dissociation 2 2 testing procedure each test is performed in four steps specimen preparation thf solution percolation hydrate formation and dissociation in series s3 and pullout loading first the pulverized sand is mixed with distilled water to reach a moisture content of 7 and then compacted in four layers in the chamber to reach a target dry density of 1 60 g cm3 the plate anchors and sensors are buried at intended positions denoted in fig 2 second thf and distilled water are mixed in a selected mass ratio to allow thf and water to completely turn into thf hydrates according to the target hydrate saturation 85 and the total pore volume in the soil specimen a desired volume approximately 15 litters of a mixture of thf and distilled water are prepared and sprayed slowly on the soil bed by 10 partitions in 10 h third the chamber is cooled down to enable hydrate formation and is blanketed by a plastic cover to avoid evaporation of thf and water the temperature in the soil bed is maintained at 7 c for 3 4 days to ensure that hydrates are completely formed in the entire soil bed fourth the buried plate anchors are loaded with vertical upwards forces at a constant displacement rate of 0 365 mm min to achieve a quasi static loading condition i e no significant inertial effects delhomme et al 2016 in series s3 after the first anchor is pulled out the cooler is turned off and the buried heater is turned on to dissociate the hydrates after complete dissociation the remaining two anchors are successively pulled out via a vertical load and an inclined load at 45 to the vertical respectively it is practically difficult to generate a large volume of hydrate bearing soil specimen with uniform properties besides the spraying procedure adopted we had explored other alternatives including seeping thf solution via pressurized air from the base of the specimen and mixing thf solution with the host soil before compaction however the former suffered from equipment failures and the latter encountered troubles as we compacted a silty sand with very high moisture content we checked the homogeneity of the specimens resulting from the praying procedure in the end of every test series the remaining soil in the chamber is dissociated at room temperature and soil samples were collected at different locations and depths to measure the moisture content and dry density the values of the back calculated hydrate saturation had a mean of 82 1 and a standard deviation of 4 1 for the samples near the base of the chamber the samples from shallower depths tended to have slightly lower saturation due to water and thf evaporation this indicates that hydrates were able to form approximately at the target hydrate saturation throughout the entire depth of the experiment chamber the temperature in the soil bed was monitored during every test series as an example fig 4 presents the temperature readings during series s1 the temperature does not vary significantly at different locations except during the phase of hydrate formation 41 112 h in fig 4 as shown in the inset in fig 4 when the temperature drops to the equilibrium temperature of thf hydrates at about 4 c the drop slows down this indicates that hydrates formation which is an exothermic process starts nevertheless the temperature ultimately stays at around 7 c 2 3 soil characteristics to characterize strengths of the soil in the model tests we conducted triaxial compression tests on hydrate bearing specimens before and after hydrate dissociation the model tests were likely under a partially drained condition because under a high hydrate saturation 85 the pores in the soil could be sealed by hydrates and may not interconnect everywhere in such a large volume of soil specimen in the model tests to avoid uncertainty in a partially drained system we performed the triaxial tests under undrained conditions considering that the strength do not significantly deviate from that under a partially drained condition for unsaturated soil samples for comparison a set of triaxial compression tests were also conducted on specimens with 85 void volume filled with thf water solution thf water mass ratio 19 81 termed wet specimens the void ratio is 0 68 in all specimens the confining pressures ranged from 50 kpa to 400 kpa to cover the stress range of our model tests table 2 summarizes the properties of the host soil and the hydrate bearing specimens fig 5 a to c presents the stress strain curves obtained from different specimens and fig 5d plots the derived mohr s circles at failure and the corresponding strength envelopes the hydrate bearing specimens before dissociation exhibit strain softening fig 5a because of particle debonding under loading cuccovillo and coop 1997 the corresponding mohr coulomb s strength envelope fig 5d is above and nearly parallel to the one obtained from the wet specimens this indicates that the presence of hydrates significantly enhances the inter particle cementation so therefore increases the apparent cohesion of the specimen i e the intersect of the strength envelope on the shear stress axis however the presence of hydrates has marginal effect on the internal friction angle this is in good agreement with results in masui et al 2005 as shown in fig 5b the shear strength in the specimens significantly drops after hydrates dissociation leading to a strength envelope even far below the one obtained from the wet specimens fig 5d two mechanisms contribute to the dissociation induced strength reduction besides the loss of hydrate cementation fabric alteration i e rearrangement of soil grains during the forming and dissociation of hydrate also impacts the shear strength of the specimens as suggested in lee et al 2010 hydrate bearing soils tend to expand at a high hydrate saturation in the forming of hydrate and contract during hydrate s dissociation consequently soil grains are moved apart as hydrates form and expand in volume as hydrates dissolve the soil skeleton is destabilized due to the expulsion of hydrates that previously constitute the skeletal frame together with soil grains 3 results 3 1 load displacement response and pullout capacity fig 6 presents the load against the displacement normalized by the buried depth of the anchors obtained from series s2 the net pullout force excluding the weight of the anchor increases up to a peak defined herein as the anchor pullout capacity and then abruptly drops at a constant burial depth the pullout capacity increases with the increase of the anchor width as expected whereas the vertical displacement required for mobilizing the capacity decreases table 3 summarizes the values of the pullout capacity obtained from all tests as we have expected the pullout capacity increases with the increase of the buried depth for a fixed plate width we also noted that test s2 h1 resulted in significantly lower pullout capacity than s1 h2 and s3 h1 although they had the same test conditions this difference is believed to be caused by the heterogeneity of the soil bed and the variation in time spent in hydrate formation series s2 was performed before s1 and s3 series s2 took four days to form hydrates and fine fissures appeared on the surface of the soil bed before loading to reduce ground fissures hydrate formation was shortened by 24 h in the successive series s1 and s3 this change causes higher values of the pullout capacity in series s1 and s3 and nevertheless it does not significantly change the general trend of the load displacement curves here we present the results in a manner less dependent on the model scale by using a dimensionless descriptor the breakout factor n c defined for anchors buried in clays under undrained conditions merifield et al 2001 rowe and davis 1982 this factor can be computed as 1 n c q u a c u q u a h Î³ a c u Î³ h c u n c 0 Î³ h c u where n c0 is the breakout factor under conditions of weightless soil denoted as the net breakout factor for short and q u is the pullout capacity of the anchor with an area a buried at depth h in a clay with an undrained shear strength c u and a unit weight of Î³ as confirmed in traxial compression tests the hydrate bearing soil in our study has a high apparent cohesion due to hydrate cementation between soil grains the contribution of this cohesion to shear strength of the hydrate bearing soil is significant especially at low confining pressure when the contribution from the internal friction is small this cohesion dominated strength behaviour in the hydrate bearing soil is similar to that of clays under undrained conditions although the origins of the strength in these two types of soils are different through an analogy between these two soil types we replace c u in eq 1 with the apparent cohesion c of the hydrate bearing soil and calculated n c0 from the test data according to eq 1 fig 7 plots the resulting n c0 against the embedment ratio h b note that the net breakout factor is used here for comparison in order to reduce the effect of different weights used in various studies the published data for square anchors buried in undrained clays with c u ranging 225 380 kpa das 1978 are also superimposed in fig 7 for comparison as shown in this figure n c0 obtained from our model tests correlates well with the embedment ratio and in general follows the trend formed by the data obtained from clays under undrained conditions das 1978 this indicates that the hydrate bearing soil interacts with the plate anchor in a similar manner as clays under undrained conditions where the apparent cohesion resulting from cementation dominantly affects the anchor capacity we noted that some of our data points obtained at larger embedment ratios e g h b 2 and 3 are higher than the experimental results by das 1978 despite the lack of replicate tests due to constraints from laboratory availability this behaviour is believed to be consistent with expected hydrate bearing soil properties the pressure dependent frictional strength of hydrate bearing soil increasingly contributes to the anchor capacity as the anchor embedment increases within the range of the embedment ratio tested in this study n c0 does not reach a steady value indicating that all the anchors in this study are in the shallow category for which the pullout capacity is sensitive to the buried depth fig 7 also compares our experimental results with the published numerical analyses for rectangular plate anchors shallowly embedded in homogenous clays under undrained conditions using different approaches including the plasticity lower bound solution merifield et al 2003 the conventional small strain based on un deformed original geometry and large deformation tracking evolution of soil geometry finite element fe simulations wang et al 2010 the small strain fe curve fits our data the best particularly at large embedment depths 3 2 effect of hydrate dissociation fig 8 plots the load displacement curves obtained before and after hydrate dissociation series s3 as the hydrates completely dissociate the load displacement response exhibits ductile feature the load gradually declines when it passes the peak for the vertically loaded anchor i e Î± 0 Î± is the loading angle to the vertical as denoted in fig 8 the pullout capacity declines to 9 5 n i e about 0 3 of the original value after hydrate dissociation this dramatic reduction in capacity occurs due to a significant decrease in shear strength of the soil associated with hydrate dissociation the hydrate saturation in the soil is rather high 85 so a significant portion of the hydrates likely act as inter particle cementations waite et al 2009 resulting in a high apparent cohesion of the soil this has been confirmed by a high value i e 510 kpa of cohesion obtained from triaxial compression tests on the hydrate bearing specimens see section 2 3 as the hydrates dissociate under the temperature rise inter particles cementations disappear causing a significant loss of shear strength in the soil and in turn a great drop in the bearing capacity of the anchors the pullout capacity of the anchor under the inclined load is larger than that of vertically loaded anchor this agrees with the existing studies on the effect of inclined loading murray and geddes 1989 3 3 failure modes fig 9 presents the failures modes of different cases the breakout cones from the tests of the hydrate bearing case are similar in shape and fig 9a and b presents the cone obtained from a typical test s2 h1 b 30 mm h 60 mm of this case the side inclination of the cones varies in a range of 58 to 61 to the vertical depending on the plate width and buried depth during loading breakout occurs suddenly with little manifestation on the ground surface these observations are consistent with the behaviour of anchorages in strongly cemented materials such as concrete delhomme et al 2015 fig 9c and d presents the breakout pattern under dissociated conditions for the vertically and obliquely loaded anchors respectively the projected area of the failure cone on the ground surface is much smaller than that in the hydrate bearing case as the load increases the breakout proceeds gradually with accumulating noticeable cracks on the ground surface 4 conclusions model tests were conducted to investigate the pullout capacity of square anchors shallowly buried in hydrate bearing soil under uplift loads the anchor is pulled out in a brittle manner forming a truncated cone in hydrate bearing ground under the test conditions with the embedment ratio less than 3 the anchors exhibit shallow anchor behaviour which is characterized by a pullout capacity dependent on the buried depth of the anchors the ultimate pullout capacity of the anchors can be estimated through a dimensionless breakout factor which increases with higher embedment ratio following a similar trend for shallow plate anchors buried in clays under undrained conditions when hydrates dissociate the pullout capacity of the anchor drops to 0 3 of the initial value this pronounced reduction highlights the need for further investigation on the effect of oceanic hydrates dissociation due to natural or anthropologic perturbation on engineering performance of offshore facilities acknowledgement we are

back calculated hydrate saturation had a mean of 82 1 and a standard deviation of 4 1 for the samples near the base of the chamber the samples from shallower depths tended to have slightly lower saturation due to water and thf evaporation this indicates that hydrates were able to form approximately at the target hydrate saturation throughout the entire depth of the experiment chamber the temperature in the soil bed was monitored during every test series as an example fig 4 presents the temperature readings during series s1 the temperature does not vary significantly at different locations except during the phase of hydrate formation 41 112 h in fig 4 as shown in the inset in fig 4 when the temperature drops to the equilibrium temperature of thf hydrates at about 4 c the drop slows down this indicates that hydrates formation which is an exothermic process starts nevertheless the temperature ultimately stays at around 7 c 2 3 soil characteristics to characterize strengths of the soil in the model tests we conducted triaxial compression tests on hydrate bearing specimens before and after hydrate dissociation the model tests were likely under a partially drained condition because under a high hydrate saturation 85 the pores in the soil could be sealed by hydrates and may not interconnect everywhere in such a large volume of soil specimen in the model tests to avoid uncertainty in a partially drained system we performed the triaxial tests under undrained conditions considering that the strength do not significantly deviate from that under a partially drained condition for unsaturated soil samples for comparison a set of triaxial compression tests were also conducted on specimens with 85 void volume filled with thf water solution thf water mass ratio 19 81 termed wet specimens the void ratio is 0 68 in all specimens the confining pressures ranged from 50 kpa to 400 kpa to cover the stress range of our model tests table 2 summarizes the properties of the host soil and the hydrate bearing specimens fig 5 a to c presents the stress strain curves obtained from different specimens and fig 5d plots the derived mohr s circles at failure and the corresponding strength envelopes the hydrate bearing specimens before dissociation exhibit strain softening fig 5a because of particle debonding under loading cuccovillo and coop 1997 the corresponding mohr coulomb s strength envelope fig 5d is above and nearly parallel to the one obtained from the wet specimens this indicates that the presence of hydrates significantly enhances the inter particle cementation so therefore increases the apparent cohesion of the specimen i e the intersect of the strength envelope on the shear stress axis however the presence of hydrates has marginal effect on the internal friction angle this is in good agreement with results in masui et al 2005 as shown in fig 5b the shear strength in the specimens significantly drops after hydrates dissociation leading to a strength envelope even far below the one obtained from the wet specimens fig 5d two mechanisms contribute to the dissociation induced strength reduction besides the loss of hydrate cementation fabric alteration i e rearrangement of soil grains during the forming and dissociation of hydrate also impacts the shear strength of the specimens as suggested in lee et al 2010 hydrate bearing soils tend to expand at a high hydrate saturation in the forming of hydrate and contract during hydrate s dissociation consequently soil grains are moved apart as hydrates form and expand in volume as hydrates dissolve the soil skeleton is destabilized due to the expulsion of hydrates that previously constitute the skeletal frame together with soil grains 3 results 3 1 load displacement response and pullout capacity fig 6 presents the load against the displacement normalized by the buried depth of the anchors obtained from series s2 the net pullout force excluding the weight of the anchor increases up to a peak defined herein as the anchor pullout capacity and then abruptly drops at a constant burial depth the pullout capacity increases with the increase of the anchor width as expected whereas the vertical displacement required for mobilizing the capacity decreases table 3 summarizes the values of the pullout capacity obtained from all tests as we have expected the pullout capacity increases with the increase of the buried depth for a fixed plate width we also noted that test s2 h1 resulted in significantly lower pullout capacity than s1 h2 and s3 h1 although they had the same test conditions this difference is believed to be caused by the heterogeneity of the soil bed and the variation in time spent in hydrate formation series s2 was performed before s1 and s3 series s2 took four days to form hydrates and fine fissures appeared on the surface of the soil bed before loading to reduce ground fissures hydrate formation was shortened by 24 h in the successive series s1 and s3 this change causes higher values of the pullout capacity in series s1 and s3 and nevertheless it does not significantly change the general trend of the load displacement curves here we present the results in a manner less dependent on the model scale by using a dimensionless descriptor the breakout factor n c defined for anchors buried in clays under undrained conditions merifield et al 2001 rowe and davis 1982 this factor can be computed as 1 n c q u a c u q u a h Î³ a c u Î³ h c u n c 0 Î³ h c u where n c0 is the breakout factor under conditions of weightless soil denoted as the net breakout factor for short and q u is the pullout capacity of the anchor with an area a buried at depth h in a clay with an undrained shear strength c u and a unit weight of Î³ as confirmed in traxial compression tests the hydrate bearing soil in our study has a high apparent cohesion due to hydrate cementation between soil grains the contribution of this cohesion to shear strength of the hydrate bearing soil is significant especially at low confining pressure when the contribution from the internal friction is small this cohesion dominated strength behaviour in the hydrate bearing soil is similar to that of clays under undrained conditions although the origins of the strength in these two types of soils are different through an analogy between these two soil types we replace c u in eq 1 with the apparent cohesion c of the hydrate bearing soil and calculated n c0 from the test data according to eq 1 fig 7 plots the resulting n c0 against the embedment ratio h b note that the net breakout factor is used here for comparison in order to reduce the effect of different weights used in various studies the published data for square anchors buried in undrained clays with c u ranging 225 380 kpa das 1978 are also superimposed in fig 7 for comparison as shown in this figure n c0 obtained from our model tests correlates well with the embedment ratio and in general follows the trend formed by the data obtained from clays under undrained conditions das 1978 this indicates that the hydrate bearing soil interacts with the plate anchor in a similar manner as clays under undrained conditions where the apparent cohesion resulting from cementation dominantly affects the anchor capacity we noted that some of our data points obtained at larger embedment ratios e g h b 2 and 3 are higher than the experimental results by das 1978 despite the lack of replicate tests due to constraints from laboratory availability this behaviour is believed to be consistent with expected hydrate bearing soil properties the pressure dependent frictional strength of hydrate bearing soil increasingly contributes to the anchor capacity as the anchor embedment increases within the range of the embedment ratio tested in this study n c0 does not reach a steady value indicating that all the anchors in this study are in the shallow category for which the pullout capacity is sensitive to the buried depth fig 7 also compares our experimental results with the published numerical analyses for rectangular plate anchors shallowly embedded in homogenous clays under undrained conditions using different approaches including the plasticity lower bound solution merifield et al 2003 the conventional small strain based on un deformed original geometry and large deformation tracking evolution of soil geometry finite element fe simulations wang et al 2010 the small strain fe curve fits our data the best particularly at large embedment depths 3 2 effect of hydrate dissociation fig 8 plots the load displacement curves obtained before and after hydrate dissociation series s3 as the hydrates completely dissociate the load displacement response exhibits ductile feature the load gradually declines when it passes the peak for the vertically loaded anchor i e Î± 0 Î± is the loading angle to the vertical as denoted in fig 8 the pullout capacity declines to 9 5 n i e about 0 3 of the original value after hydrate dissociation this dramatic reduction in capacity occurs due to a significant decrease in shear strength of the soil associated with hydrate dissociation the hydrate saturation in the soil is rather high 85 so a significant portion of the hydrates likely act as inter particle cementations waite et al 2009 resulting in a high apparent cohesion of the soil this has been confirmed by a high value i e 510 kpa of cohesion obtained from triaxial compression tests on the hydrate bearing specimens see section 2 3 as the hydrates dissociate under the temperature rise inter particles cementations disappear causing a significant loss of shear strength in the soil and in turn a great drop in the bearing capacity of the anchors the pullout capacity of the anchor under the inclined load is larger than that of vertically loaded anchor this agrees with the existing studies on the effect of inclined loading murray and geddes 1989 3 3 failure modes fig 9 presents the failures modes of different cases the breakout cones from the tests of the hydrate bearing case are similar in shape and fig 9a and b presents the cone obtained from a typical test s2 h1 b 30 mm h 60 mm of this case the side inclination of the cones varies in a range of 58 to 61 to the vertical depending on the plate width and buried depth during loading breakout occurs suddenly with little manifestation on the ground surface these observations are consistent with the behaviour of anchorages in strongly cemented materials such as concrete delhomme et al 2015 fig 9c and d presents the breakout pattern under dissociated conditions for the vertically and obliquely loaded anchors respectively the projected area of the failure cone on the ground surface is much smaller than that in the hydrate bearing case as the load increases the breakout proceeds gradually with accumulating noticeable cracks on the ground surface 4 conclusions model tests were conducted to investigate the pullout capacity of square anchors shallowly buried in hydrate bearing soil under uplift loads the anchor is pulled out in a brittle manner forming a truncated cone in hydrate bearing ground under the test conditions with the embedment ratio less than 3 the anchors exhibit shallow anchor behaviour which is characterized by a pullout capacity dependent on the buried depth of the anchors the ultimate pullout capacity of the anchors can be estimated through a dimensionless breakout factor which increases with higher embedment ratio following a similar trend for shallow plate anchors buried in clays under undrained conditions when hydrates dissociate the pullout capacity of the anchor drops to 0 3 of the initial value this pronounced reduction highlights the need for further investigation on the effect of oceanic hydrates dissociation due to natural or anthropologic perturbation on engineering performance of offshore facilities acknowledgement we are

23031,this paper focuses on adaptive integral sliding mode control for a class of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with uncertain dynamics where the vehicles moving in three dimensional 3 d space have only three available control inputs provided by the stern propellers steering and diving rudders but five degrees of freedom to be controlled different from the traditional sliding mode control the proposed dual closed loop integral sliding mode control design can be described as comprising two distinct phases 1 in outer loop the virtual velocity commands are determined for the following work 2 in inner loop the actual control inputs are designed to achieve the trajectory tracking moreover the practical situations that there exist systematic parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are also considered and a novel direct adaptive neural network controller combined with a conditional integrator is presented which provides the robustness and adaptation for the vehicle in addition the rigorous stability analysis based lyapunov s method demonstrates the uniform ultimate boundedness of all the tracking errors in the closed loop system finally simulation results are shown the effectiveness of the proposed controllers keywords autonomous underwater vehicle underactuated system sliding mode control neural network parametric uncertainty 1 introduction in the past years the motion control problem for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles auvs has received considerable attention due to its theoretical challenges and increasing number of scientific and military applications the interested reader is referred to recent books do and pan 2009 fossen 2011 for a framework to study the control design and maneuverability of these systems as mentioned in the paper aguiar and hespanha 2007 the main difficulty involved in the control of these vehicles is highly dependent on the configuration indeed fully actuated auvs with independent actuators in all degrees of freedom dofs are suitable for low speed maneuvering in confined water and dynamic positioning however for trajectory tracking of auvs at high speed the vehicle dynamics are assumed to be underactuated which means that they have less available control inputs than the number of dofs therefore previous work in the literature designed for the fully actuated systems such as adaptive integral proportional derivative pd control antonelli et al 2001 antonelli 2007 herman and adamski 2017 backstepping and lyapunov direct methods liu et al 2008 and 2009 do 2015 karkoub et al 2017 sliding mode control giorgio and alessandro 2010 bartoszewicz 2015 yan and yu 2018 robust integral of the sign of the error rise control structure nicholas et al 2014 and lie group variational integrators amit et al 2011 cannot be directly employed in underactuated case in this paper we are interested in the trajectory tracking problem for underactuated auvs in three dimensional 3 d space which is well defined by aguiar and hespanha 2007 it should be pointed out that in this mission scenario the vehicle s dynamics are required to be all consistent with the reference trajectory which includes the time evolutions of position attitude as well as the velocities in practice for the strongly coupled nonlinear multivariable auv systems this tracking control problem presents significant challenges since the vehicle s dynamics are affected by parametric and non parametric uncertainties as well as environmental disturbances unfortunately many results reported in the literature rely on accurate knowledge of the system parameters or based on assumptions of no external disturbances for example model based design techniques have been developed in jon et al 2008 and martin et al 2018 respectively the combined problem of horizontal trajectory planning and tracking control has been investigated in filoktimon and evangelos 2007 in addition other classic control methods such as backstepping and lyapunov direct methods bi et al 2010 do 2013 xiang et al 2015 line of sight based rout et al 2017 model predictive control gan et al 2018 shen et al 2018 are also respectively developed for trajectory tracking of auvs nevertheless a good controller should maintain satisfactory tracking performance by providing the robustness and adaptation to against the systematic uncertainties and external disturbances to this affect considerable robust and adaptive techniques are applied for the control of auvs such as neural networks zhang et al 2009 khoshnam and mohammad 2015 cui et al 2017 fuzzy logic systems wallace et al 2010 sliding mode control sankaranarayanan and mahindrakar 2009 wang et al 2015 jian et al 2015 cui et al 2017 qiao and zhang 2017 ramezani al and tavanaei sereshki 2018 however the controllers designed by neural networks or fuzzy systems heavily depend on the number of the neural network nodes or the number of the fuzzy rule bases thereby resulting in more computational effort and online learning time it is relevant to point out that a much simpler controller with less computational burden is prefer for its implementation in practice which also motivates our current research sliding mode control is another effective robust nonlinear control technique known as low sensitivity to systematic uncertainty and good rejection of disturbances among these interesting works extended state observer based in cui et al 2017 and finite time control in li et al 2015 have been investigated for auvs with unknown disturbances and uncertain dynamics respectively a new reaching law for adaptive sliding mode control of an auv was presented to try to estimate the upper bound of disturbance and uncertainty however to the best of authors knowledge previous work reported in the literature only have position closed loop control design and consider the velocities of the vehicles are constant in contrast to previous work this paper considers more nonlinear and coupled behaviors of the vehicle such that the robust adaptive sliding mode control laws are suitable for the three dimensional underactuated case recently the dual closed loop integral sliding mode controllers were discussed in the literature liang and li 2014 zhang and cao 2015 for spacecraft and autonomous airship respectively however the stability analysis of two loops is actually separated in the paper in other words a unified lyapunov function for both outer loop and inner loop systems are not given in the proof motivated by aforementioned considerations this paper is concerned with the trajectory tracking control problem for a class of underactuated 5 dof auvs in the presence of uncertain dynamics and unknown environmental disturbances to provide the robustness and adaptation dual closed loop integral sliding mode controllers composed of an inner velocity loop and an outer position loop are developed which not only ensure the convergence of tracking errors to a boundary layer of the sliding manifold but also allow for its first time derivatives inspired by the work in chen et al 2009 a novel direct adaptive neural network control is proposed to exactly approximate the systematic uncertain dynamics the main advantage of the proposed method is that only one adaptive parameter should be estimated online regardless of the number of neural network nodes used in addition a conditional integrator originally proposed by singh and khalil 2005 is introduced here to deal with the unknown disturbances where the approach well inherits the advantages of proportional integral pi control and sliding mode technique but without their weakness the main difference between our approach and others is in the fact that in the proposed algorithm the dynamical couplings and underactuated characteristic of the auv are directly taken into account the complete stability analysis of the closed loop systems is given by using lyapunov methods to demonstrate the uniform ultimate boundedness of all the tracking errors to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme simulation results for the tracking control of the following two scenarios are shown in the paper a spiral diving curve with constant velocity and a spatial sine trajectory with time varying velocity the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 formulates the mathematical model of underactuated auvs with uncertain dynamics section 3 presents the adaptive dual closed loop integral sliding mode control design and in section 4 the rigorous stability analysis of the overall closed loop system is completed simulation results and conclusions are given in section 5 and 6 respectively 2 auv model consider the following underactuated 5 dof auvs discussed in do and pan 2009 khoshnam and mohammad 2015 where its nonlinear hydrodynamic damping terms of order higher than two and roll motion are negligible its mathematical model expressed in a matrix form is as follows 1 Î· j Î· v m v c v v d v v g Î· Ï Ï d where Î· x y z Î¸ Ï t and v u Ï w q r t denote the position coordinates in the earth fixed frame and the velocities

underactuated property for the control issue we re arrange the motion equations of the vehicle as similar process in khoshnam and mohammad 2015 where the kinetics can be divided into two equations that include actuated and unactuated dynamics that is 5 Î· j a Î· v a j w Î· v w m 1 v a c 1 v w v a d 1 v a v a g 1 Î· Ï a Ï d 1 m 2 v w c 2 v a v w d 2 v w v w Ï d 2 where v a u q r t and v w Ï

these parameters are not shown in details the reader can easily obtain the results in straightforward computation or is referred to khoshnam and mohammad 2015 3 adaptive sliding mode controller this paper focuses on the trajectory tracking control problem of underactuated auvs in three dimensional space the main control objective is to guarantee that all the dynamics of the vehicle are consistent with the time evolutions of the position attitude and velocity firstly define the desired trajectory as Î· d x d y d z d Î¸ d Ï d t and the pitch and yaw angles are given by Î¸ d a tan 2 z d v t Ï d a tan 2 y d x d where the velocity v t x d 2 y d 2 however for an underactuated auv if the tracking output is set at the position of the geometric centre i e y Î· the system may prove nonminimum phase as noticed in consolini and tosques 2012 for this reason here the system output is defined as follows 7 y h Î· x l cos Î¸ cos Ï y l cos Î¸ sin Ï z l sin Î¸ where l is chosen to make the virtual point at a positive constant l from the position of the centre of mass com and also on the vehicle s symmetry axis then the control issue is to design the controller to make the system output track the reference trajectory the detailed block diagram of the proposed robust adaptive integral sliding mode controller is shown in fig 1 3 1 outer loop integral sliding mode controller in this subsection the control task is to design the velocity commands v c for the actuated velocity v a by using the available system output y here the control design is based on a reasonable assumption that the desired trajectory y d x d y d z d t and its time derivatives are smooth and bounded then the integral sliding mode surface is designed as 8 s Î· e Î· k 1 0 t e Î· t d t where e Î· y y d represents the tracking error in the outer closed loop system and k 1 is a positive control parameter taking the time derivative of 8 yields 9 s Î· j Î· Î· v a y d k 1 e Î· j Î´ Î· v w where 10 j Î· Î· cos Î¸ cos Ï l sin Î¸ cos Ï l sin Ï cos Î¸ sin Ï l sin Î¸ sin Ï l cos Ï sin Î¸ l cos Î¸ 0 j Î´ Î· v w Ï sin Ï w sin Î¸ cos Ï Ï cos Ï w sin Î¸ sin Ï w cos Î¸ then the velocity commands v c are designed as follows 11 v a v c j Î· 1 Î· y d k 1 e Î· j Î´ Î· v w k Î· s Î· Ï 1 tanh s Î· Ï 1 where k Î· and Ï 1 are positive constants to be chosen later and the positive constant Ï 1 denotes the thickness of boundary layer substituting 11 into 9 one obtains 12 s Î· k Î· s Î· Ï 1 tanh s Î· Ï 1 and consider the following lyapunov control function 13 v 1 1 2 s Î· t s Î· taking the time derivative of 13 along 12 one obtains 14 v 1 k Î· s Î· t s Î· Ï 1 s Î· t tanh s Î· Ï 1 which is negative semidefinite therefore the convergence of the error variables s Î· and e Î· to zero can be guaranteed 3 2 inner loop integral sliding mode controller in the following the control task is to design the actual control inputs Ï a to make the velocity v a asymptotically converge to the command v c designed in previous step i e e v v a v c 0 the second integral sliding mode surface is chosen as 15 s v e v k 2 0 t e v t d t where k 2 is a positive constant then differentiating s v it yields 16 s v m 1 1 Î· c 1 v w v a d 1 v a v a g 1 Î· Ï a Ï d1 v c k 2 e v obviously if the system dynamics and environmental disturbances are all known or available for the control design the following controller can be easily designed 17 Ï a m 1 v c k 2 e v k v s v Ï 2 tanh s v Ï 2 c 1 v w v a d 1 v a v a g 1 Î· Ï d1 where k v is a positive constant to be chosen later however in practice such a prior knowledge of the parameters and the upper bounds of these unknown nonlinearities are unavailable thus this approach is infeasible fortunately such restrictions can be removed by using adaptive neural network control but the traditional neural network approximations always suffer from a drawback that the number of the parameters to be estimated online will increase significantly with an increase of neural network nodes therefore one of the contributions in this paper is to develop a novel revised neural network controller which can exactly approximate the systematic uncertainty 3 3 novel adaptive neural network approximation it is well known that rbf neural networks with sufficiently large number of neural network nodes and appropriate placed node centres and variances can approximate any continuous function f z over a compact set Ï z â q to make arbitrary any accuracy as 18 f z w t s z Îµ where z Ï z â q is the input vector w denotes the ideal constant weight vector and Îµ is the approximation error the regressor vector s z s 1 z s n z t where s i z is defined as 19 s i z exp z c i t z c i b i 2 i 1 n where n is the number of neural network nodes c i and b i denote the centre and the width of the receptive field respectively using the universal approximation property of rbf neural networks the continuous smooth function f z can be approximated as follows 20 f Ë z w t s z where w is the weight vector in this paper the unknown continuous function f z is defined as follows 21 f z m 1 m 1 v c k 2 e v c 1 v w v a d 1 v a v a g 1 Î· where m 1 represents the known nominal value of m 1 then the following adaptive neural network controller is chosen as 22 Ï a m 1 v c k 2 e v w t s z Ï d1 k v s v Ï 2 tanh s v Ï 2 its adaptation rules are chosen as 23 w Î³ w s v s t z Ï w w where Î³ w and Ï w are positive constants consider the lyapunov function candidate as 24 v 2 1 2 s v t m 1 s v 1 2 i 1 3 w i t Î³ w 1 w i taking the time derivative of 24 it yields 25 v 2 s v t k v s v Ï 2 s v t tanh s v Ï 2 s v t Îµ i 1 3 Ï w w i t w i as aforementioned before the traditional control design will take prohibitively large online learning time with the increase of neural network nodes used so a novel adaptive neural network control will be developed in this paper firstly define a new parameter variable as Ï max w i 2 i 1 2 3 then the revised adaptive controller is proposed as follows 26 Ï a m 1 v c k 2 e v 1 2 Ï Ë s t z s z s v Ï d1 k v s v Ï 2 tanh s v Ï 2 where Ï Ë is the estimate of the unknown

systematic parameter uncertainties are considered but the environmental disturbances are not taken into account in the following a conditional integrator will be introduced to deal with the environmental disturbances where it inherits the advantages of proportional integral pi control and sliding mode control but without their weakness 3 4 conditional integrator inspired by the work in singh and khalil 2005 the adaptive controller in 26 is revised with an auxiliary control vector Ï Ë d which can be regarded as the estimate of the disturbances Ï d Ï d1 Îµ that is 30 Ï a m 1 v c

are diagonal matrices and s a t is an element wise saturation function then define the variable s d as 32 s d h 1 s v g Ï m s a t s d s d 1 s d 2 s d 3 s a t s d i 1 s d i 1 s d i s d i 1 1 s d i 1 where s d can be regarded as the sliding manifold as can be seen from 31 the state vector Ï m is constructed by using an integrator of the tracking error s v under the unsaturated condition so called conditional integrator in this particular case we will show the auxiliary control vector Ï m is bounded consider the lyapunov control function as follows 33 v Ï 1 2 Ï m t g 1 Ï m then taking the

derivative of v Ï is re written as follows 36 v Ï 1 3 2 Ï m 2 3 2 g 1 h 2 Î» v Ï c where Î» 2 3 g 0 and c 3 2 g 1 h 2 the above inequality means that Ï m is bounded and can be adjusted by properly choosing the control parameters g and h 4 stability analysis the main results about the proposed sliding mode control can be summarized in the following theorem theorem 1 consider a class of underactuated 5 dof auvs with the kinematics and dynamics in 1 under assumption that the desired state space trajectory is sufficiently smooth and bounded if the control laws are given in 11 and 30 and the adaptive parameters are updated by 27 and 31 then all the tracking errors in the closed loop system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded uub and the size of the convergence can be made arbitrary small by properly choosing the control gains proof as the control design includes an outer position loop control and an inner velocity loop control the rigorous stability analysis should be given by using a unified lyapunov function for overall closed loop systems and in the subsection 3 1 we have shown the stability of the outer closed loop system in the following the convergence of the tracking errors in the inner velocity loop can be demonstrated consider the lyapunov function candidate as v 4 1 2 s Î· t s Î· 1 2 s v t m 1 s v 1 2 Î³ Ï 2 the undisturbed case for

neighbourhood of zero as if it is a sliding mode controller this gives the complete proof for the theorem 1 5 simulation results in this section to illustrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed control scheme numerical simulations have been performed on an underactuated auv in 5 dof by using matlab simulink the model matrices in 1 are taken as follows m 215 0 0 0 0 0 265 0 0 0 0 0

system parameters will simultaneously increase the errors of the order of 10 on actual model in addition the environmental disturbances are also taken into account the disturbances in jian et al 2015 which act on all the dynamics are chosen as Ï d i 0 1 m i i sin 0 1 t 1 r a n d where r a n d is gaussian random noise with mean 0 and variance 1 in the following two mission scenarios are considered 1 tracking a spiral diving curve with a constant velocity and 2 moving along the spatial sine trajectory with a time varying velocity the detailed desired trajectories and initial positions of the vehicle are shown in table 1 in both cases the same control parameters are chosen for the controllers 30 the virtual velocity commands 11 and the updated adaptation rules 27 with l 0 5 k 1 0 5 k 2 1 Ï i 1 Ï i 1 k Î· 1 k v 20 for the neural network control the gaussian rbf neural network with the centres c i evenly spaced on 2 2 and the width b i 0 5 Î³ 10 Ï Î³ 0 01 for the conditional integrator 31 the control gain matrices are as k d i a g 5 1 1 h d i a g 10 2 2 and g d i a g 0 5 0 1 0 1 the simulations are run with the different initial error conditions and the initial states v 0 Ï 0 and Ï m 0 it will be shown below that even with aforementioned constraints the proposed control scheme can also provide the strong robustness and good adaptation to the vehicle against the systematic uncertainties and environmental disturbances the simulation results for tracking a spiral diving curve with a constant velocity are shown in fig 2 7 it can be seen that the vehicle can converge to the desired trajectory and the tracking errors stay in a neighbourhood of zero as shown in fig 3 the actual velocities and control inputs of the auv are displayed in fig 4 and 5 respectively where u 1 m s and r 0 1 r a d s as the virtual velocity commands it is worth to be noticed that as the curvature of the desired trajectory changes the orientation tracking error cannot converge to zero in the case of nonzero lateral velocity Ï however all the tracking errors are uub as we demonstrated in stability analysis it should be noted here that no matter how many neural network nodes used only one adaptive parameter Ï is needed to be estimated online which results in less computation burden and much simpler implementations for its practical applications from all above figures we can clearly see that the satisfactory performance of the closed loop system can be achieved under the proposed controller in scenario 2 the underactuated auv moves along a spatial sine trajectory with time varying velocities even though at initial time the vehicle is not on the reference trajectory we can see in fig 9 that the position tracking errors remain almost zero but the attitude tracking errors converge to a compact set around the zero due to the rapidly changing curvature indeed the maximum of the attitude errors is about 0 5 r a d which is acceptable for the practical applications as observed in fig 10 and 11 the actual velocities and control inputs of the vehicle present the time varying characteristics this is the main difference from the traditional control design where only position closed loop is included but the velocity of the vehicle is considered as constant moreover the results of adaptive parameter Ï and auxiliary state vector Ï m are shown in fig 12 and 13 respectively in contrast to the results in scenario 1 the adaptive parameter Ï seemingly does not converge to a constant due to the time varying velocities which is well understood from all above results it is relevant to point out that the satisfactory tracking performance of the proposed control scheme is guaranteed even though the underactuated auv may subject to unknown dynamics and environmental disturbances 6 conclusion in this paper a robust adaptive integral sliding mode controller is developed for the trajectory tracking control of underactuated auvs in 5 dof where the vehicle dynamics are unknown and also subject to environmental disturbances the dual closed loop control design ensures that the vehicle s dynamics are all consistent with the reference state space trajectory including the time evolutions of position attitude as well as velocities and all the tracking errors in the closed loop systems are shown to be uniform ultimate boundedness by lyapunov stability analysis and numerical simulations this paper also considers the practical situation that there exist systematic parametric uncertainties and external disturbances for the vehicle therefore it is necessary to redesign a novel direct adaptive neural network controller combined with a conditional integrator to provide the robustness and adaptation for underactuated auvs in contrast to previous work this paper considers more nonlinear and coupled behaviors of the vehicle such that the robust adaptive sliding mode control laws are suitable for the three dimensional underactuated cases in particular no matter how many neural network nodes used only one parameter is needed to be estimated online which benefits for its implementation on the

23031,this paper focuses on adaptive integral sliding mode control for a class of underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles auvs with uncertain dynamics where the vehicles moving in three dimensional 3 d space have only three available control inputs provided by the stern propellers steering and diving rudders but five degrees of freedom to be controlled different from the traditional sliding mode control the proposed dual closed loop integral sliding mode control design can be described as comprising two distinct phases 1 in outer loop the virtual velocity commands are determined for the following work 2 in inner loop the actual control inputs are designed to achieve the trajectory tracking moreover the practical situations that there exist systematic parametric uncertainties and external disturbances are also considered and a novel direct adaptive neural network controller combined with a conditional integrator is presented which provides the robustness and adaptation for the vehicle in addition the rigorous stability analysis based lyapunov s method demonstrates the uniform ultimate boundedness of all the tracking errors in the closed loop system finally simulation results are shown the effectiveness of the proposed controllers keywords autonomous underwater vehicle underactuated system sliding mode control neural network parametric uncertainty 1 introduction in the past years the motion control problem for underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles auvs has received considerable attention due to its theoretical challenges and increasing number of scientific and military applications the interested reader is referred to recent books do and pan 2009 fossen 2011 for a framework to study the control design and maneuverability of these systems as mentioned in the paper aguiar and hespanha 2007 the main difficulty involved in the control of these vehicles is highly dependent on the configuration indeed fully actuated auvs with independent actuators in all degrees of freedom dofs are suitable for low speed maneuvering in confined water and dynamic positioning however for trajectory tracking of auvs at high speed the vehicle dynamics are assumed to be underactuated which means that they have less available control inputs than the number of dofs therefore previous work in the literature designed for the fully actuated systems such as adaptive integral proportional derivative pd control antonelli et al 2001 antonelli 2007 herman and adamski 2017 backstepping and lyapunov direct methods liu et al 2008 and 2009 do 2015 karkoub et al 2017 sliding mode control giorgio and alessandro 2010 bartoszewicz 2015 yan and yu 2018 robust integral of the sign of the error rise control structure nicholas et al 2014 and lie group variational integrators amit et al 2011 cannot be directly employed in underactuated case in this paper we are interested in the trajectory tracking problem for underactuated auvs in three dimensional 3 d space which is well defined by aguiar and hespanha 2007 it should be pointed out that in this mission scenario the vehicle s dynamics are required to be all consistent with the reference trajectory which includes the time evolutions of position attitude as well as the velocities in practice for the strongly coupled nonlinear multivariable auv systems this tracking control problem presents significant challenges since the vehicle s dynamics are affected by parametric and non parametric uncertainties as well as environmental disturbances unfortunately many results reported in the literature rely on accurate knowledge of the system parameters or based on assumptions of no external disturbances for example model based design techniques have been developed in jon et al 2008 and martin et al 2018 respectively the combined problem of horizontal trajectory planning and tracking control has been investigated in filoktimon and evangelos 2007 in addition other classic control methods such as backstepping and lyapunov direct methods bi et al 2010 do 2013 xiang et al 2015 line of sight based rout et al 2017 model predictive control gan et al 2018 shen et al 2018 are also respectively developed for trajectory tracking of auvs nevertheless a good controller should maintain satisfactory tracking performance by providing the robustness and adaptation to against the systematic uncertainties and external disturbances to this affect considerable robust and adaptive techniques are applied for the control of auvs such as neural networks zhang et al 2009 khoshnam and mohammad 2015 cui et al 2017 fuzzy logic systems wallace et al 2010 sliding mode control sankaranarayanan and mahindrakar 2009 wang et al 2015 jian et al 2015 cui et al 2017 qiao and zhang 2017 ramezani al and tavanaei sereshki 2018 however the controllers designed by neural networks or fuzzy systems heavily depend on the number of the neural network nodes or the number of the fuzzy rule bases thereby resulting in more computational effort and online learning time it is relevant to point out that a much simpler controller with less computational burden is prefer for its implementation in practice which also motivates our current research sliding mode control is another effective robust nonlinear control technique known as low sensitivity to systematic uncertainty and good rejection of disturbances among these interesting works extended state observer based in cui et al 2017 and finite time control in li et al 2015 have been investigated for auvs with unknown disturbances and uncertain dynamics respectively a new reaching law for adaptive sliding mode control of an auv was presented to try to estimate the upper bound of disturbance and uncertainty however to the best of authors knowledge previous work reported in the literature only have position closed loop control design and consider the velocities of the vehicles are constant in contrast to previous work this paper considers more nonlinear and coupled behaviors of the vehicle such that the robust adaptive sliding mode control laws are suitable for the three dimensional underactuated case recently the dual closed loop integral sliding mode controllers were discussed in the literature liang and li 2014 zhang and cao 2015 for spacecraft and autonomous airship respectively however the stability analysis of two loops is actually separated in the paper in other words a unified lyapunov function for both outer loop and inner loop systems are not given in the proof motivated by aforementioned considerations this paper is concerned with the trajectory tracking control problem for a class of underactuated 5 dof auvs in the presence of uncertain dynamics and unknown environmental disturbances to provide the robustness and adaptation dual closed loop integral sliding mode controllers composed of an inner velocity loop and an outer position loop are developed which not only ensure the convergence of tracking errors to a boundary layer of the sliding manifold but also allow for its first time derivatives inspired by the work in chen et al 2009 a novel direct adaptive neural network control is proposed to exactly approximate the systematic uncertain dynamics the main advantage of the proposed method is that only one adaptive parameter should be estimated online regardless of the number of neural network nodes used in addition a conditional integrator originally proposed by singh and khalil 2005 is introduced here to deal with the unknown disturbances where the approach well inherits the advantages of proportional integral pi control and sliding mode technique but without their weakness the main difference between our approach and others is in the fact that in the proposed algorithm the dynamical couplings and underactuated characteristic of the auv are directly taken into account the complete stability analysis of the closed loop systems is given by using lyapunov methods to demonstrate the uniform ultimate boundedness of all the tracking errors to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme simulation results for the tracking control of the following two scenarios are shown in the paper a spiral diving curve with constant velocity and a spatial sine trajectory with time varying velocity the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 formulates the mathematical model of underactuated auvs with uncertain dynamics section 3 presents the adaptive dual closed loop integral sliding mode control design and in section 4 the rigorous stability analysis of the overall closed loop system is completed simulation results and conclusions are given in section 5 and 6 respectively 2 auv model consider the following underactuated 5 dof auvs discussed in do and pan 2009 khoshnam and mohammad 2015 where its nonlinear hydrodynamic damping terms of order higher than two and roll motion are negligible its mathematical model

underactuated property for the control issue we re arrange the motion equations of the vehicle as similar process in khoshnam and mohammad 2015 where the kinetics can be divided into two equations that include actuated and unactuated dynamics that is 5 Î· j a Î· v a j w Î· v w m 1 v a c 1 v w v a d 1 v a v a g 1 Î· Ï a Ï d 1 m 2 v w c 2 v a v w d 2 v w v w Ï d 2 where v a u q r t and v w Ï

these parameters are not shown in details the reader can easily obtain the results in straightforward computation or is referred to khoshnam and mohammad 2015 3 adaptive sliding mode controller this paper focuses on the trajectory tracking control problem of underactuated auvs in three dimensional space the main control objective is to guarantee that all the dynamics of the vehicle are consistent with the time evolutions of the position attitude and velocity firstly define the desired trajectory as Î· d x d y d z d Î¸ d Ï d t and the pitch and yaw angles are given by Î¸ d a tan 2 z d v t Ï d a tan 2 y d x d where the velocity v t x d 2 y d 2 however for an underactuated auv if the tracking output is set at the position of the geometric centre i e y Î· the system may prove nonminimum phase as noticed in consolini and tosques 2012 for this reason here the system output is defined as follows 7 y h Î· x l cos Î¸ cos Ï y l cos Î¸ sin Ï z l sin Î¸ where l is chosen to make the virtual point at a positive constant l from the position of the centre of mass com and also on the vehicle s symmetry axis then the control issue is to design the controller to make the system output track the reference trajectory the detailed block diagram of the proposed robust adaptive integral sliding mode controller is shown in fig 1 3 1 outer loop integral sliding mode controller in this subsection the control task is to design the velocity commands v c for the actuated velocity v a by using the available system output y here the control design is based on a reasonable assumption that the desired trajectory y d x d y d z d t and its time derivatives are smooth and bounded then the integral sliding mode surface is designed as 8 s Î· e Î· k 1 0 t e Î· t d t where e Î· y y d represents the tracking error in the outer closed loop system and k 1 is a positive control parameter taking the time derivative of 8 yields 9 s Î· j Î· Î· v a y d k 1 e Î· j Î´ Î· v w where 10 j Î· Î· cos Î¸ cos Ï l sin Î¸ cos Ï l sin Ï cos Î¸ sin Ï l sin Î¸ sin Ï l cos Ï sin Î¸ l cos Î¸ 0 j Î´ Î· v w Ï sin Ï w sin Î¸ cos Ï Ï cos Ï w sin Î¸ sin Ï w cos Î¸ then the velocity commands v c are designed as follows 11 v a v c j Î· 1 Î· y d k 1 e Î· j Î´ Î· v w k Î· s Î· Ï 1 tanh s Î· Ï 1 where k Î· and Ï 1 are positive constants to be chosen later and the positive constant Ï 1 denotes the thickness of boundary layer substituting 11 into 9 one obtains 12 s Î· k Î· s Î· Ï 1 tanh s Î· Ï 1 and consider the following lyapunov control function 13 v 1 1 2 s Î· t s Î· taking the time derivative of 13 along 12 one obtains 14 v 1 k Î· s Î· t s Î· Ï 1 s Î· t tanh s Î· Ï 1 which is negative semidefinite therefore the convergence of the error variables s Î· and e Î· to zero can be guaranteed 3 2 inner loop integral sliding mode controller in the following the control task is to design the actual control inputs Ï a to make the velocity v a asymptotically converge to the command v c designed in previous step i e e v v a v c 0 the second integral sliding mode surface is chosen as 15 s v e v k 2 0 t e v t d t where k 2 is a positive constant then differentiating s v it yields 16 s v m 1 1 Î· c 1 v w v a d 1 v a v a g 1 Î· Ï a Ï d1 v c k 2 e v obviously if the system dynamics and environmental disturbances are all known or available for the control design the following controller can be easily designed 17 Ï a m 1 v c k 2 e v k v s v Ï 2 tanh s v Ï 2 c 1 v w v a d 1 v a v a g 1 Î· Ï d1 where k v is a positive constant to be chosen later however in practice such a prior knowledge of the parameters and the upper bounds of these unknown nonlinearities are unavailable thus this approach is infeasible fortunately such restrictions can be removed by using adaptive neural network control but the traditional neural network approximations always suffer from a drawback that the number of the parameters to be estimated online will increase significantly with an increase of neural network nodes therefore one of the contributions in this paper is to develop a novel revised neural network controller which can exactly approximate the systematic uncertainty 3 3 novel adaptive neural network approximation it is well known that rbf neural networks with sufficiently large number of neural network nodes and appropriate placed node centres and variances can approximate any continuous function f z over a compact set Ï z â q to make arbitrary any accuracy as 18 f z w t s z Îµ where z Ï z â q is the input vector w denotes the ideal constant weight vector and Îµ is the approximation error the regressor vector s z s 1 z s n z t where s i z is defined as 19 s i z exp z c i t z c i b i 2 i 1 n where n is the number of neural network nodes c i and b i denote the centre and the width of the receptive field respectively using the universal approximation property of rbf neural networks the continuous smooth function f z can be approximated as follows 20 f Ë z w t s z where w is the weight vector in this paper the unknown continuous function f z is defined as follows 21 f z m 1 m 1 v c k 2 e v c 1 v w v a d 1 v a v a g 1 Î· where m 1 represents the known nominal value of m 1 then the following adaptive neural network controller is chosen as 22 Ï a m 1 v c k 2 e v w t s z Ï d1 k v s v Ï 2 tanh s v Ï 2 its adaptation rules are chosen as 23 w Î³ w s v s t z Ï w w where Î³ w and Ï w are positive constants consider the lyapunov function candidate as 24 v 2 1 2 s v t m 1 s v 1 2 i 1 3 w i t Î³ w 1 w i taking the time derivative of 24 it yields 25 v 2 s v t k v s v Ï 2 s v t tanh s v Ï 2 s v t Îµ i 1 3 Ï w w i t w i as aforementioned before the traditional control design will take prohibitively large online learning time with the increase of neural network nodes used so a novel adaptive neural network control will be developed in this paper firstly define a new parameter variable as Ï max w i 2 i 1 2 3 then the revised adaptive controller is proposed as follows 26 Ï a m 1 v c k 2 e v 1 2 Ï Ë s t z s z s v Ï d1 k v s v Ï 2 tanh s v Ï 2 where Ï Ë is the estimate of the unknown

systematic parameter uncertainties are considered but the environmental disturbances are not taken into account in the following a conditional integrator will be introduced to deal with the environmental disturbances where it inherits the advantages of proportional integral pi control and sliding mode control but without their weakness 3 4 conditional integrator inspired by the work in singh and khalil 2005 the adaptive controller in 26 is revised with an auxiliary control vector Ï Ë d which can be regarded as the estimate of the disturbances Ï d Ï d1 Îµ that is 30 Ï a m 1 v c

are diagonal matrices and s a t is an element wise saturation function then define the variable s d as 32 s d h 1 s v g Ï m s a t s d s d 1 s d 2 s d 3 s a t s d i 1 s d i 1 s d i s d i 1 1 s d i 1 where s d can be regarded as the sliding manifold as can be seen from 31 the state vector Ï m is constructed by using an integrator of the tracking error s v under the unsaturated condition so called conditional integrator in this particular case we will show the auxiliary control vector Ï m is bounded consider the lyapunov control function as follows 33 v Ï 1 2 Ï m t g 1 Ï m then taking the

properly choosing the control parameters g and h 4 stability analysis the main results about the proposed sliding mode control can be summarized in the following theorem theorem 1 consider a class of underactuated 5 dof auvs with the kinematics and dynamics in 1 under assumption that the desired state space trajectory is sufficiently smooth and bounded if the control laws are given in 11 and 30 and the adaptive parameters are updated by 27 and 31 then all the tracking errors in the closed loop system can be guaranteed to be uniformly ultimately bounded uub and the size of the convergence can be made arbitrary small by properly choosing the control gains proof as the control design includes an outer position loop control and an inner velocity loop control the rigorous stability analysis should be given by using a unified lyapunov function for overall closed loop systems and in the subsection 3 1 we have shown the stability of the outer closed loop system in the following the convergence of the tracking errors in the inner velocity loop can be demonstrated consider the lyapunov function candidate as v 4 1 2 s Î· t s Î· 1 2 s v t m 1 s v 1 2 Î³ Ï 2 the undisturbed case for Ï d 0 and Ï Ë d 0 taking the time derivative of v 4 yields 37 v 4 s Î· t k Î· 1 2 s Î· s v t k v 1 2 j Î· Î· s v Ï 1 s Î· t tanh s Î· Ï 1 Ï 2 s v t tanh s v Ï 2 2 k Ï 2 Ï Î³ Ï 2 3 2 Ï Î³ 2 k Ï Ï Ë 2 Î¼ v 4 Î´ where k Ï is a positive constant Î¼ and Î´ are defined as follows 38 Î¼ min k Î· 1 2 m 1 1 k v 1 2 j Î· Î· 2 k Ï 2 Ï Î³ Î³ Î´ 3 2 Ï Î³ 2 k Ï Ï Ë doing the algebra we can conclude that 39 v 4 t v 4 0 e 2 Î¼ t Î´ 2 Î¼ therefore the tracking errors in the closed loop system are uub and the bounded is dependent on the values of the control gains and neural network ideal weights the disturbed case for Ï d 0 when the tracking error s v is large from the equation 32 we can obtain s a t s d sgn s v then taking the time derivative of v 4 yields 40 v 4 s Î· t k Î· 1 2 s

neighbourhood of zero as if it is a sliding mode controller this gives the complete proof for the theorem 1 5 simulation results in this section to illustrate the satisfactory performance of the proposed control scheme numerical simulations have been performed on an underactuated auv in 5 dof by using matlab simulink the model matrices in 1 are taken as follows m 215 0 0 0 0 0 265 0 0 0 0 0 265 0 0 0 0 0 80 0 0 0 0 0 80 d v d i a g 70 100 u 100 200 Ï 100 200 w 50 100 q 50 100 r in practice these parameters are impossible to be accurately obtained so specifically we assume that the system parameters will simultaneously increase the errors of the order of 10 on actual model in addition the environmental disturbances are also taken into account the disturbances in jian et al 2015 which act on all the dynamics are chosen as Ï d i 0 1 m i i sin 0 1 t 1 r a n d where r a n d is gaussian random noise with mean 0 and variance 1 in the following two mission scenarios are considered 1 tracking a spiral diving curve with a constant velocity and 2 moving along the spatial sine trajectory with a time varying velocity the detailed desired trajectories and initial positions of the vehicle are shown in table 1 in both cases the same control parameters are chosen for the controllers 30 the virtual velocity commands 11 and the updated adaptation rules 27 with l 0 5 k 1 0 5 k 2 1 Ï i 1 Ï i 1 k Î· 1 k v 20 for the neural network control the gaussian rbf neural network with the centres c i evenly spaced on 2 2 and the width b i 0 5 Î³ 10 Ï Î³ 0 01 for the conditional integrator 31 the control gain matrices are as k d i a g 5 1 1 h d i a g 10 2 2 and g d i a g 0 5 0 1 0 1 the simulations are run with the different initial error conditions and the initial states v 0 Ï 0 and Ï m 0 it will be shown below that even with aforementioned constraints the proposed control scheme can also provide the strong robustness and good adaptation to the vehicle against the systematic uncertainties and environmental disturbances the simulation results for tracking a spiral diving curve with a constant velocity are shown in fig 2 7 it can be seen that the vehicle can converge to the desired trajectory and the tracking errors stay in a neighbourhood of zero as shown in fig 3 the actual velocities and control inputs of the auv are displayed in fig 4 and 5 respectively where u 1 m s and r 0 1 r a d s as the virtual velocity commands it is worth to be noticed that as the curvature of the desired trajectory changes the orientation tracking error cannot converge to zero in the case of nonzero lateral velocity Ï however all the tracking errors are uub as we demonstrated in stability analysis it should be noted here that no matter how many neural network nodes used only one adaptive parameter Ï is needed to be estimated online which results in less computation burden and much simpler implementations for its practical applications from all above figures we can clearly see that the satisfactory performance of the closed loop system can be achieved under the proposed controller in scenario 2 the underactuated auv moves along a spatial sine trajectory with time varying velocities even though at initial time the vehicle is not on the reference trajectory we can see in fig 9 that the position tracking errors remain almost zero but the attitude tracking errors converge to a compact set around the zero due to the rapidly changing curvature indeed the maximum of the attitude errors is about 0 5 r a d which is acceptable for the practical applications as observed in fig 10 and 11 the actual velocities and control inputs of the vehicle present the time varying characteristics this is the main difference from the traditional control design where only position closed loop is included but the velocity of the vehicle is considered as constant moreover the results of adaptive parameter Ï and auxiliary state vector Ï m are shown in fig 12 and 13 respectively in contrast to the results in scenario 1 the adaptive parameter Ï seemingly does not converge to a constant due to the time varying velocities which is well understood from all above results it is relevant to point out that the satisfactory tracking performance of the proposed control scheme is guaranteed even though the underactuated auv may subject to unknown dynamics and environmental disturbances 6 conclusion in this paper a robust adaptive integral sliding mode controller is developed for the trajectory tracking control of underactuated auvs in 5 dof where the vehicle dynamics are unknown and also subject to environmental disturbances the dual closed loop control design ensures that the vehicle s dynamics are all consistent with the reference state space trajectory including the time evolutions of position attitude as well as velocities and all the tracking errors in the closed loop systems are shown to be uniform ultimate boundedness by lyapunov stability analysis and numerical simulations this paper also considers the practical situation that there exist systematic parametric uncertainties and external disturbances for the vehicle therefore it is necessary to redesign a novel direct adaptive neural network controller combined with a conditional integrator to provide the robustness and adaptation for underactuated auvs in contrast to previous work this paper considers more nonlinear and coupled behaviors of the vehicle such that the robust adaptive sliding mode control laws are suitable for the three dimensional underactuated cases in particular no matter how many neural network nodes used only one parameter is needed to be estimated online which benefits for its implementation on the aspects of time saving or energy saving acknowledgements this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grant 51179038 51105088 51309067 51409055 and partly

perpendicular foot on the structure surface n refers to the outward normal vector of the structure surface 3 numerical simulation and analysis in this section the simulation of spudcan penetrating sand and clay was conducted under axisymmetric conditions based on the above algorithm it is worth noting here that numerical singularity may occur for axisymmetric problems when particles get too close to the symmetry axis therefore the aforementioned frictional sliding contact algorithm was also employed to treat the axis combing with the ghost particles method thus the particles could be effectively pushed away when approaching the axis the schematic diagram of the numerical model is shown in fig 1 soil and water particles were initially superimposed and then moved separately according to their own governing equations three simulation cases i e medium dense sand dense sand and kaolin clay were conducted all of them assumed that the soil was completely immersed in water with free surface ghost particle method was employed to model the boundaries the left boundary of the model i e symmetric axis was assumed to be free slip which means that particles could move freely along the boundary but cannot penetrate it the right and the bottom of the model was assumed to non slip the spudcan was given a constant downward velocity and the interaction with mixture was modeled as frictional sliding contact for either sand or clay elastic perfectly plastic behavior was assumed drucker prager criterion was adopted with non associated flow rule it should be noted here the objective of this study was to propose a computational framework hence the d p model was chosen for simplification since the water was considered to be weakly compressible the water density should be initialized according to the hydrostatic pressure of incompressible fluid the initial density was inversely calculated by equation 21 to prevent the unphysically diffusion near the free surface the so called shepard filtering method was used every 1000 timesteps to reinitialize the density field the material parameters and the geometry are listed in table 1 for case 1 and case 2 totally 3000 water particles and 2100 soil particles were used with initial particle space Î´ d 0 2 m for case 3 totally 4745 water particles and 3900 soil particles were used with initial particle space Î´ d 0 5 m since sph is based on explicit time integration the time step should be determined according to the so called cfl condition in this study the time step is significantly dependent on the permeability of soil to keep the calculations stable the time step Î´ t was set to 1 0 10 6 s and 1 0 10 7 s for case 1 2 and case 3 respectively fig 2 shows the continuous penetration process of the spudcan into medium dense sand i e case 1 the spudcan was initially located above the soil surface while immersed in the water as the spudcan penetrates part of the soil was forced downward while a certain amount of soil near the edge flows outward and forms a heave subsequently the cavity forms gradually and remains open the penetration continues up to a depth of 4 m and the back flow doesn t occur the water level keeps unchanged it indicates that by using the proposed sph model the free surface of soil and water could be conveniently tracked without any techniques fig 3 shows the penetration resistance during installation in medium dense sand the cel calculated results by qiu and grabe 2012 are included for comparison it was shown that before the normalized penetration depth reaching 0 3 the sph results accord with cel quite well the maximum penetration resistance was around 550 kpa considering the soil porosity as a field variable or not has no significant effect on the penetration resistance since the cel results are based on the penetration into two layer soil of which the soft clay underlies the sand further penetration leads to a reduction of penetration resistance in this study however single sand layer was simulated for simplicity this does not detract from the objective of this study which is to propose a computational approach consequently only the initial penetration stage i e up to a normalized depth of around 0 35 is needed to validate the proposed method as the penetration goes on the predicted resistance by the proposed method is about 5 lower than without considering the soil porosity however taking the porosity as a variable or a constant almost gives the same results the reason is that for the medium dense sand only small volume dilation occurs and hence has little effect on the penetration resistance fig 4 gives the variation of the penetration resistance in dense sand predicted by different methods the cel and sph present the identical tendency whereas the cel results appear to oscillate severely the penetration resistance reaches maximum value of 680 700 kpa roughly at normalized depth of 0 18 and then decreases gradually to about 550 600 kpa in the initial stage i e d d 0 18 all three sph cases almost give the identical penetration resistance since the soil dilation is little and has no enormous effect the effect of the porosity on the penetration resistance arises after reaching peak value the penetration resistance calculated by sph considering the spatially varying porosity came to be the minimum it indicates that soil porosity has an enormous effect on the penetration resistance and should not be neglected for dense sand the maximum difference of the calculated value reaches roughly 10 the reason is that the cel analysis was conducted in two layer soil in which soft clay underlies the dense sand in contrast this study only simulated single layer sand for simplicity further studies will try to seek for an appropriate treatment to the interface of two adjacent soil layers see fig 5 next the jack in process of spudcan in clay was simulated aiming at investigating the excess pore water pressure generated beneath the spudcan fig 4 shows the generation of excess pore water pressure at the normalized depth d d 0 4 0 8 respectively as mentioned above so far few numerical research has been reported on the generation and dissipation of excess pore water pressure during the jack in process of spudcan the only one was conducted by yi et al 2012 which was in fact an approximate treatment and the soil water interaction was not taken into account yi et al conducted the undrained effective stress analysis by separately defining the soil skeleton s effective stress strain matrix and the bulk modulus of water and superimposing the two components in the user defined material based on abaqus explicit results calculated by yi et al were also shown in fig 4 on the left for comparison at shallow normalized penetration depth i e d d 0 4 the maximum excess pore water pressure reached 60 kpa directly below the spudcan then a maximum value of 130 kpa was reached as d d increased to 0 8 comparing the left and the right of fig 4 a b the excess pore water pressure by sph tends to decrease more rapidly with the radical distance for instance in fig 4 b the excess pore water pressure bulb on the right extends laterally outwards to about 12 0 m whereas the left reaches 17 0 m it should be noted here the excess pore water pressure in the vicinity of the edge appears to be irregular due to lacking of enough particles further study will try to dynamically add particles to improve accuracy while avoid too much computational effort wu et al 2017 4 conclusions sph has been extensively applied to computational geomechanics due to its meshless nature large deformation problems could be conveniently addressed in the framework of sph without encountering mesh distortion this study dedicates to broaden the application of sph to geotechnical field a fully coupled soil water structure interaction algorithm was proposed within sph in which each phase was assumed to occupy only part of the macroscopic soil water mixture based on two phase mixture theory the soil was considered to be elastic perfectly plastic material whereas the water was treated as weakly compressible newtonian

acting against the structure could be captured finally the continuous penetration process of the spudcan which involves large soil deformation and complex soil water structure interaction was

solve the tensile instability problem for water in low permeable soil it was found that the water particles would form clumps and thus lead to wrong pore water pressure for low permeable soil without using the artificial pressure term the Ï was taken as w 0 h w Î´ d h which equals to 3 24 for wendland kernel function with h equals to 1 2 Î´ d 2 3 constitutive model for soil and water constitutive model for both soil and water are needed to close the above governing equations throughout this study the water was considered as weakly compressible newtonian fluid the soil was treated as elastic

this contact algorithm the boundary deficiency problem was properly treated and those soil water particles located near or on the boundary could obtain precise acceleration wang et al 2013 wang and

perpendicular foot on the structure surface n refers to the outward normal vector of the structure surface 3 numerical simulation and analysis in this section the simulation of spudcan penetrating sand and clay was conducted under axisymmetric conditions based on the above algorithm it is worth noting here that numerical singularity may occur for axisymmetric problems when particles get too close to the symmetry axis therefore the aforementioned frictional sliding contact algorithm was also employed to treat the axis combing with the ghost particles method thus the particles could be effectively pushed away when approaching the axis the schematic diagram of the numerical model is shown in fig 1 soil and water particles were initially superimposed and then moved separately according to their own governing equations three simulation cases i e medium dense sand dense sand and kaolin clay were conducted all of them assumed that the soil was completely immersed in water with free surface ghost particle method was employed to model the boundaries the left boundary of the model i e symmetric axis was assumed to be free slip which means that particles could move freely along the boundary but cannot penetrate it the right and the bottom of the model was assumed to non slip the spudcan was given a constant downward velocity and the interaction with mixture was modeled as frictional sliding contact for either sand or clay elastic perfectly plastic behavior was assumed drucker prager criterion was adopted with non associated flow rule it should be noted here the objective of this study was to propose a computational framework hence the d p model was chosen for simplification since the water was considered to be weakly compressible the water density should be initialized according to the hydrostatic pressure of incompressible fluid the initial density was inversely calculated by equation 21 to prevent the unphysically diffusion near the free surface the so called shepard filtering method was used every 1000 timesteps to reinitialize the density field the material parameters and the geometry are listed in table 1 for case 1 and case 2 totally 3000 water particles and 2100 soil particles were used with initial particle space Î´ d 0 2 m for case 3 totally 4745 water particles and 3900 soil particles were used with initial particle space Î´ d 0 5 m since sph is based on explicit time integration the time step should be determined according to the so called cfl condition in this study the time step is significantly dependent on the permeability of soil to keep the calculations stable the time step Î´ t was set to 1 0 10 6 s and 1 0 10 7 s for case 1 2 and case 3 respectively fig 2 shows the continuous penetration process of the spudcan into medium dense sand i e case 1 the spudcan was initially located above the soil surface while immersed in the water as the spudcan penetrates part of the soil was forced downward while a certain amount of soil near the edge flows outward and forms a heave subsequently the cavity forms gradually and remains open the penetration continues up to a depth of 4 m and the back flow doesn t occur the water level keeps unchanged it indicates that by using the proposed sph model the free surface of soil and water could be conveniently tracked without any techniques fig 3 shows the penetration resistance during installation in medium dense sand the cel calculated results by qiu and grabe 2012 are included for comparison it was shown that before the normalized penetration depth reaching 0 3 the sph results accord with cel quite well the maximum penetration resistance was around 550 kpa considering the soil porosity as a field variable or not has no significant effect on the penetration resistance since the cel results are based on the penetration into two layer soil of which the soft clay underlies the sand further penetration leads to a reduction of penetration resistance in this study however single sand layer was simulated for simplicity this does not detract from the objective of this study which is to propose a computational approach consequently only the initial penetration stage i e up to a normalized depth of around 0 35 is needed to validate the proposed method as the penetration goes on the predicted resistance by the proposed method is about 5 lower than without considering the soil porosity however taking the porosity as a variable or a constant almost gives the same results the reason is that for the medium dense sand only small volume dilation occurs and hence has little effect on the penetration resistance fig 4 gives the variation of the penetration resistance in dense sand predicted by different methods the cel and sph present the identical tendency whereas the cel results appear to oscillate severely the penetration resistance reaches maximum value of 680 700 kpa roughly at normalized depth of 0 18 and then decreases gradually to about 550 600 kpa in the initial stage i e d d 0 18 all three sph cases almost give the identical penetration resistance since the soil dilation is little and has no enormous effect the effect of the porosity on the penetration resistance arises after reaching peak value the penetration resistance calculated by sph considering the spatially varying porosity came to be the minimum it indicates that soil porosity has an enormous effect on the penetration resistance and should not be neglected for dense sand the maximum difference of the calculated value reaches roughly 10 the reason is that the cel analysis was conducted in two layer soil in which soft clay underlies the dense sand in contrast this study only simulated single layer sand for simplicity further studies will try to seek for an appropriate treatment to the interface of two adjacent soil layers see fig 5 next the jack in process of spudcan in clay was simulated aiming at investigating the excess pore water pressure generated beneath the spudcan fig 4 shows the generation of excess pore water pressure at the normalized depth d d 0 4 0 8 respectively as mentioned above so far few numerical research has been reported on the generation and dissipation of excess pore water pressure during the jack in process of spudcan the only one was conducted by yi et al 2012 which was in fact an approximate treatment and the soil water interaction was not taken into account yi et al conducted the undrained effective stress analysis by separately defining the soil skeleton s effective stress strain matrix and the bulk modulus of water and superimposing the two components in the user defined material based on abaqus explicit results calculated by yi et al were also shown in fig 4 on the left for comparison at shallow normalized penetration depth i e d d 0 4 the maximum excess pore water pressure reached 60 kpa directly below the spudcan then a maximum value of 130 kpa was reached as d d increased to 0 8 comparing the left and the right of fig 4 a b the excess pore water pressure by sph tends to decrease more rapidly with the radical distance for instance in fig 4 b the excess pore water pressure bulb on the right extends laterally outwards to about 12 0 m whereas the left reaches 17 0 m it should be noted here the excess pore water pressure in the vicinity of the edge appears to be irregular due to lacking of enough particles further study will try to dynamically add particles to improve accuracy while avoid too much computational effort wu et al 2017 4 conclusions sph has been extensively applied to computational geomechanics due to its meshless nature large deformation problems could be conveniently addressed in the framework of sph without encountering mesh distortion this study dedicates to broaden the application of sph to geotechnical field a fully coupled soil water structure interaction algorithm was proposed within sph in which each phase was assumed to occupy only part of the macroscopic soil water mixture based on two phase mixture theory the soil was considered to be elastic perfectly plastic material whereas the water was treated as weakly compressible newtonian fluid interaction between two phases was composed of pore water pressure and viscous drag force moreover soil porosity was considered as spatial field variable but not a constant two types of particles i e soil and water particles were initially superimposed and then moved separately according to their own governing equations besides frictional sliding contact algorithm was employed to model the interaction of structure with soil water particles making use of the proposed approach the soil effective stress the excess pore water pressure the soil porosity and the reaction force acting against the structure could be captured finally the continuous penetration process of the spudcan which involves large soil deformation and complex soil water structure interaction was simulated the good agreement with previous research indicates the robustness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm acknowledgments this research is supported by the national natural science

23033,human activities including design construction operation management and maintenance are all a predominant part of the daily tasks in offshore operations it is not surprising to observe major failures are related to human error since humans are susceptible to making mistakes due to the high level of uncertainty in human activities predicting all causes of human errors is not an easy process this may lead to inaccurate results which may affect the overall safety and reliability of marine operations evaluation of human endurance during activity on board is a key factor in minimizing risk of human failure this study aims to examine uncertainties over the time of the marine operation to estimate accurate human reliability assessment a framework is developed to model the uncertainty of human performance factors by considering a hydrodynamic analysis of the structure along with a subjective analysis of human activities under different weather conditions subsequently a model based on dynamic bayesian approach is developed to evaluate the time duration effect on human performance throughout the operation the developed methodology has been applied to a case study of an offshore vessel storing extracted oil the framework demonstrates that probability of human failure increases towards the end of its operational days however the high variation in human reliability is greatly dependent on weather conditions the present study is able to improve the safety of human life in marine operations by predicting the reliability of performances as a function of time during a specific operation keywords human error harsh environment dynamic bayesian network failure rate 1 introduction human error is one of the main causes of failure in everyday functioning it is connected to human behavior that is considered undesirable and somehow unpredictable due to the high uncertainty involved in human performance when changes occur in the environment and working area of any operation from standard condition to non standard condition such as a harsh environment human error plays an imperative part in operational failure controlling the health of the operation is a challenging task and is subject to various uncertainties and sources of failure in technical organizational and human activities amongst these general classifications human performance has a high failure rate zipoli et al 2018 islam et al 2017a abaei et al 2017 bahootoroody et al 2016 islam et al 2018b and involves much uncertainty due to lack of supporting empirical evidence hence developing a precise framework to model the uncertainty of human performance is essential to mitigate risk of human failure during marine operations in a harsh environment risk assessment should be considered in design construction maintenance and operation to enhance the safety and reliability of marine and offshore structures noroozi et al 2014 however risk assessment is associated with various uncertainties that have a severe economic impact on projects due to potential failures lack of adequate information about previous failures and useful data for developing a probability model are the main impediment in the assessment and quantifying of operational risks moreover selection of an appropriate quantitated risk methodology that best represents human error uncertainty in a complex situation is challenging khan et al 2015 identified three main sources of information required for component failure estimation which are 1 expert judgment 2 experience and knowledge data accumulated from a local field and 3 data and information shared across industries operating in a harsh environment however human beings cannot be regarded as a component in estimating the failure by just using data mining or experience due to the high level of uncertainty associated with human performance in system reliability the component is referred to as a structural or technical system such as crane electrical chip boards and dynamic positioning dp system all these components are necessarily involved with human activities and to prevent the unexpected failures due to human error their imperative role should not be neglected therefore it is essential to quantify human error by considering the human performance shaping factor psf using either expert judgment or real simulation both results in a great deal of uncertainty for computing human error probability hep there is no guarantee that the expert team will consider all aspects of human error especially in a harsh environment where there is a lack of sufficient experience this means that there may still be a chance of existing unpredicted sources of human error despite precise monitoring being carried out to detect all potential failures in a system hep assessment techniques have initially been based on research in the nuclear industry and most of them have been developed based on expert judgment techniques these techniques include successive likelihood index method slim technique for human error rate prediction therp justified human error data information jhedi and human error assessment and reduction technique heart kirwan et al 1997 kirwan 1997 noroozi et al 2010 a great deal of research to assess heps using the aforementioned methods has been undertaken by many researchers abbassi et al 2015 dimattia 2005 miller and swain 1986 noroozi et al 2013 2014 raafat and abdouni 1987 zamanali et al 1992 however at a glance it is clear that the main focus of previous studies has been to evaluate a stationary process of human error regardless of duration of human activities although the assumption of neglecting the variation in human activity over a longer period could be generally true under normal conditions it can lead to underestimated results as site environments change quickly in a harsh environment therefore it is essential to understand what the trend of human reliability is in the case of time dependent parameters included in probability estimation and how human performance will be affected by a harsh environment in recent years bayesian network methodology has been developed in the field of artificial intelligence nielsen and jensen 2009 it is common agreement that this causal network based method is a powerful tool to calculate the probability of events given the observation evidence of other events in the same network based on graph theory ghosh 2008 recently bayesian networks bn and dynamic bayesian networks dbns have been widely used in engineering decision strategy leoni et al 2019 abaei et al 2018b bahootoroody et al 2019 arzaghi et al 2017 bhandari et al 2016 friis hansen 2000 khakzad et al 2011 dbn offers a flexible probabilistic network to model time dependencies of a set of random variables in time domain hosseini and takahashi 2007 takahashi nakata 2006 friis hansen 2000 in the present study a model using bn is developed to assess the influencing parameters that cause human failure as a function of time under different environmental conditions for this purpose to model the effect of extreme response and human feedback during an operation in a harsh environment a real simulation of a floating structure is considered further to model the effect of time on human performance a human reliability framework is developed based on the dynamic bayesian approach to estimate the effect of human fatigue on hep during the specific time of marine operations under three different weather conditions the outcome of this research is allowing industries to understand the reliability of human performance as a function of time and the ability to improve the safety of human life in marine operations 2 methodology development the imperative role of human error on the performance of a system has been considered in previous studies this study develops a novel methodology to evaluate human performance on a floating structure for a distinct time in marine and offshore operations subjected to the harsh environment the present framework proposes a dbn to consider different aspects of influencing factors that cause human failure a schematic illustration of the proposed methodology is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 determining human reliability function human performance can improve due to increase in knowledge and experience however over a lengthy period of a specific operational time human error will increase due to critical level of fatigue in this case dynamic analysis of human performance is necessary to understand time variation of human reliability during the operational time at the early stage of the project with respect to the entire time of the operation labor is not expected to be a considerable error however performance will be notably affected towards the final stage of the working period due to high level of fatigue or change in environmental conditions as recommended by stewart 1992 existing error rate data for human error in engineering problems are mainly considered as the average error rate the computation of the average error rate is based on the assumption that each human error is totally independent of other error events and that the error rate is constant therefore the probability of human error can be represented in the discrete format of binomial distribution or continues format of exponential distribution with constant failure rate stewart 1992 in order to include the effect of time on human error an exponential distribution nielsen and jensen 2009 is applied to estimate the human reliability 1 r t 1 exp Î» t t o h t 2 h t 1 t t o 0 t t 0 where Î» is a constant failure rate for the exponential distribution h t is heaviside step function to consider the fact that human reliability has meaning only for the operation that t t 0 and t 0 is the time that the operation will start 2 2 dbn implementation to updated hep a dynamic bayesian approach is considered to model human reliability over time in different weather conditions a brief overview on bayesian networks bns is discussed in pearl and russel 1988 while a more comprehensive theoretical background on bn is found in pearl 1988 and nielsen and jensen 2009 moreover many software packages are available for the computation of bns as discussed in murphy and russell 2001 in the following paragraph a brief introduction on dbn is provided as a tool to study the effect of time on human failures over a specified period dbn is an extension of ordinary bn that is used for evaluating a set of random variables over a discretized time line dbn can be interpreted as a generalization of markov process models which have commonly been applied for the modeling of deterioration as described in straub 2009 markov deterioration processes are explained as conditional dependency and independency over time for a given condition at time t 1 therefore the condition at any further time t i 1 t i is statistically independent of the condition of any previous time step t i 1 t i accordingly each sequence of time slice consists of one or more bn nodes the slices are connected by directed link from nodes in slice i to nodes in slice i 1 correspondingly a node at time slice i 1 can be conditionally dependent on its parents at the previous time slices i and the present time i 1 simultaneously the conditional probability table for a set of stochastic variables x at each time step is then expressed as p x i 1 x i p a x i 1 p a x i finally the joint distribution of a set of x random variables in i 1 time step will be achieved as a consequence of bayes rule nielsen and jensen 2009 as explained in equation 3 3 p x i 1 j 1 m x j i 1 x j i p a x j i 1 p a x j i i 1 n j 1 m where i is the time step that joint distribution is supposed to be computed from previous time slice while j is the number of bn nodes associated with next time slice to consider conditional dependencies and independencies states of any system described as a dbn satisfy the markovian condition that assumes that the state of a system at time t i depends only on its immediate past at t i 1 straub 2009 in this study a fatigue model based on the dbn is developed to predict human behavior in marine operations due to the long term on board activities for this purpose the factors that have imperative effects on causing human fatigue are considered in this study as suggested by islam et al 2017a 2018a and represented as human performance shaping factors psfs the most important shaping factors that can cause human fatigue are 1 weather condition f1 defined as the long term occurrence of extreme wave heights hs and zero up crossing wave period ts in a harsh environment 2 ship motion f2 defined as the critical response of the vessel encountering extreme wave heights 3 noise and vibration f3 and 4 work environment f4 defined as the condition that makes the situation intolerable for the personnel on board each of these psfs should be assigned probability of occurrence to represent the uncertainties that involve these factors these probabilities can be derived either from simulation or expert judgment depending on the type of psf and the availability of the historic data abaei et al 2018c islam et al 2017b in this study the probability table for the root nodes of f1 and f2 i e hydrodynamic related psfs are obtained based on the proposed hydrodynamic framework developed by the previous work of the same authors of this study abaei et al 2018c for an offshore operation in a harsh environment for this purpose a numerical model was developed to simulate a storm condition for evaluating performance of marine floating structures as a basis for human tolerance under the extreme responses the floating structure subjected to the storm and the behavior of the vessel was examined to see whether it was in safe condition or when it exceeded its survival limit conditions for human as a result an intensifying wave train was considered for modeling dynamic behaviour of the structure and consequently for evaluating human performance on the floating structure the developed storm condition adopted was for an extensive range of intensity level of encountering waves the approach has the capability to be applied for critical analysis to any type of marine structure including commercial displacement vessels which are subjected to storm also it is helpful for performing human risk and reliability analysis while operating on marine structures and for improving safety of the crews on board in a harsh environment abaei et al 2018c the logical probabilities for other factors f3 and f4 are derived from the expert judgment exemplified by islam et al 2017a for similar marine operations an illustrative dbn of the proposed methodology to estimate the human fatigue reliability over time in marine operations is represented in fig 2 2 3 construction of conditional probability tables cpts to implement the dbn model for human fatigue inference the network needs to be parametrized with logical numbers that represent the probability for the root nodes and the conditional probabilities for the link the probabilities for the root nodes are estimated based on hydrodynamic analysis and using the expert judgment process as mentioned in section 2 2 however computing the conditional probability tables for the fatigue nodes is not an easy process as it is a subjective estimation and there is no relationship available for these nodes although it is common to obtain such probabilities from statistical analysis of a large amount of training data it is not recommended by ji et al 2006 cooper herskovits 1992 for human reliability assessment however based on recent studies on large scale subjective surveys ji et al 2006 rosekind et al 2000 sherry 2000 for parametrizing the bn model a noisy or principle does provide a favorable solution the noisy or model has three assumptions the first being is its causal inhibition this is based on three assumptions 1 a cause effect relation between the parameters 2 exception independence which means that each cause is mutually exclusive and 3 accountability which assumes an event can happen if and only if at least one cause has occurred neapolitan 2004 these assumptions help to introduce conditional probability tables for the model in the noisy or principle all states of the node f1 f2 fn can be defined in a binary format these states represent all possible conditions of a variable e g fatigue yes or fatigue no therefore any event such as f i yes will cause human fatigue unless an inhibitor or a preventing factor prevents the error in human performance finally the probability q i is defined as ji et al 2006 4 1 j n q i p f a t i g u e n o f 1 f 2 f i f n therefore the noisy or model assumes that the presence of each shaping factor such as extreme roll response of the vessel f2 extreme roll angle is sufficient to produce the presence of human fatigue and its effect is independent of the presence of other causes the same subjectivity representation is recommended by islam et al 2017a and ji et al 2006 in other words the presence of fatigue will trigger human malfunction if one of the influence factors occurs this assumption is reasonable in reality although it is a subjective point of view as investigated by chen and moan 2004 in addition previous studies demonstrated this point from the conducted experiments and expert judgments that each of these psfs can independently cause human error ji et al 2006 chen et al 2004 a graphical representation of the noisy or principle is illustrated in fig 3 the concept for modeling the dbn in terms of simulating human fatigue over time is that the previous time slices are connected to the corresponding nodes at current time for analyzing conjugate behavior of temporal human performance as a result the previous nodes will provide diagnostic information for the corresponding human activity at currenttime thus fatigue at current time is inferred from fatigue at the previous time along with current observations ji et al 2006 this concept will allow estimation of human error over the time by transferring subjective information in the node for the next time period in each time slice the fatigue model is expanded dynamically with addition temporal links that connect to the intermediate nodes at the previous time slice and to the corresponding nodes at current time slice the cpts for the structural responses and human performance are derived from and based on hydrodynamic simulations and expert judgment respectively however transitional probabilities over the time for modeling dbn are specified subjectively for their framework related to the driver fatigue model as suggested by ji et al 2006 due to lack of available data for human activities in marine operations the process for construction of cpt is always a crucial step this is a particularly thorough process especially for the factors that have no physic basis such as f3 and f4 as a result it is necessary to rely on the survey data gathered from expert judgment by conducting a questionnaire survey among experienced seafarers around the world as presented by islam et al 2017a in this approach there are three steps to construct the cpt table first a questionnaire should be developed to determine the impact of desired child nodes variables second a survey method such as monkey link should be created to conduct the data collection and third the collected data needs to be translated to a probability to represent the cpt for the desired links in the probability network in this study cpt table is constructed based on the conducted survey by islam et al 2017a the other factors relating to the hydrodynamic performance of the vessel will be obtained based on the stochastic analysis of the structure and a designed wave profile the results are then extracted and changed to a probability model with a proper limit identified to understand the tolerable level for human performance on the vessel 3 application of the methodology case study 3 1 scenario development to illustrate different steps in the methodology a practical case study is considered for evaluation of human reliability during marine operation on a sevan 1000 floating storage unit fsu encountering a harsh environment this structure has been designed to operate in the mariner field in the north sea hanssen 2013 the structure is a storage unit incorporating a main hull with overall length of 85 m and draft of 30 m a part of the case study investigates human performance based on the extreme response of the vessel when subjected to different incident waves to model the hydrodynamic based psf nodes see fig 3 for this purpose the criteria and the operational limits similar to chen et al 2004 and hanssen 2013 will be applied to translate the effect of structural response on reasonable human reliability therefore the structure will be simulated in an actual harsh environment subjected to a stochastic wave train a safe level will then be considered for human activity on board to evaluate a true condition of human failure during the operation the other factors will be modeled based on expert judgment and the available precursor data for the marine operation 3 2 results and discussions with increase in the duration of human activity in the operation the uncertainty of human performance increases notably which is necessary when considering time varying effect of human error in reliability assessment based on maritime labor convention mlc the number of working hours on ships should be 8 h a day lillie 2008 under normal circumstances with one day of rest and a maximum of 14 h in any 24 h period in general mlc recommends a short term strategy that working hours on ships should not exceed 49 h per week however these rules are still not considered as having reliable strategies for evaluating the long term prediction of human performance during an extended operations time as suggested by ji et al 2006 it is necessary to estimate human endurance to understand how individuals will gradually become exhausted with an increase in time to return labor to normal conditions a long term reliability estimation should be performed to analyse the maximum endurance of human performance this will assist individuals to be granted a proper rest period to prevent build up of human fatigue therefore in this study a period of 100 days is considered to evaluate performance of human ability when remaining on board in the proposed dbn 5 different time slices are considered for modeling human fatigue in order to obtain the hydrodynamic based factors orcaflex software is employed to model the sea environment and evaluate the stochastic response of the vessel under the different sea conditions for this purpose eleven sea states are considered with these waves based on the approach proposed by abaei et al 2018c and abaei et al 2018d to identify the severity of the wave condition the profile is divided into three levels of intensity normal moderate and extreme a summary of the significant wave heights and the zero up crossing wave period are explained in table 1 subsequently these eleven sea states are transferred to a spectral analysis to obtain the wave profile of the sea environment an illustration of the developed wave profile is shown in fig 4 the profile is divided into three sections for identifying the intensity of the sea condition based on the human tolerable operational limit hanssen 2013 where 5 m is considered to be a normal operation chen et al 2004 considering the designed wave profiles the probability density function for the occurrence of the wave height is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation method mle as recommended by abaei et al 2017 and abaei et al 2018a and the result represented in fig 5 to identify three levels in the wave profile a 70 percentile of the minimum observed wave heights is considered as normal condition 70 to 90 of the minimum wave heights defined as moderate and 10 percentile of the highest encountering waves considered as the extreme conditions the designed wave train in fig 4 is modeled in orcaflex and the hydrodynamic performance of the vessel is estimated by the extreme response of the roll degree the result of the stochastic response was analyzed and the pdf of the response obtained using mle method is plotted in fig 6 the same approach is applied for dividing the response to the three levels of normal moderate and extreme weather conditions based on the conducted survey of 236 experts in the field of marine operations on the floating structures presented by islam et al 2017a the probability of the influencing parameters on human fatigue on different levels of weather conditions for noise and vibration and work condition obtained is represented in fig 7 to achieve the time domain human reliability assessment the probability obtained for quantifying the psfs and the values entered in the dbn model are presented in fig 2 the probability value for the fatigue node in each time step is estimated based on the approach described in section 2 2 of the presented methodology in this study genie software is employed to perform the reliability analysis of human fatigue over the introduced time slices the analysis conducted for all three weather conditions and the reliability of human fatigue during the 100 days of the operation is presented in fig 8 the results demonstrate the effect operational time has on decreasing reliability of human performance in a marine operation the important point is that for the considered case study reliability of human performance will not touch zero under normal and moderate conditions however it will decrease over 100 days for the extreme weather condition by assuming that the acceptable safe level for probability of human fatigue is 1e 5 chen et al 2004 the proposed framework for the conducted case study confirms that a person can endure continuous duty for up to 60 days under normal conditions 40 days under moderate conditions and 20 days under extreme conditions the operation is otherwise prone to human failures increasing day by day this methodology will be an assistive tool for industry to estimate the expected time of human fatigue by incorporating their deviation from the optimum level of wellness the dbn framework will consider response based on psf in monitoring human performance over the time and estimating the rate of human error the presented results of this study are imperative for improving the safety of human operations in different sea environments the developed framework is capable of assisting authorized companies to consider a reliable decision for scheduling the best time of the operation and identifying a substitute timetable to minimize the risk of human failure 4 conclusion in this study a framework is developed to evaluate human fatigue during a marine operation a dbn based model is presented for the uncertainty in human performance and for estimating human reliability in a defined period of marine operation a hydrodynamic analysis and a survey based approach is applied to model influencing factors on human performance the proposed framework can provide more realistic results on reliability of human performances during a period of marine operation for the demonstrated case study the reliable time for a person working on board is two months under normal conditions however it is less than three weeks in an extreme environment this framework is able to incorporate environmental data as well as ship motions to evaluate human performance on board and reflects the expected time of their fatigue while considering the associated uncertain key factors affecting on crews due to extreme conditions such as storm in future the present methodology could be considered as a platform for integrating cognitive based error such as personal interests in a specific activity which is entirely dependent on an individuals desire to monitor human error depending on operational time the framework is also capable of being adopted for future decision making assessment to improve the safety of human life in marine operations while undertaking duties in different weather conditions 
23033,human activities including design construction operation management and maintenance are all a predominant part of the daily tasks in offshore operations it is not surprising to observe major failures are related to human error since humans are susceptible to making mistakes due to the high level of uncertainty in human activities predicting all causes of human errors is not an easy process this may lead to inaccurate results which may affect the overall safety and reliability of marine operations evaluation of human endurance during activity on board is a key factor in minimizing risk of human failure this study aims to examine uncertainties over the time of the marine operation to estimate accurate human reliability assessment a framework is developed to model the uncertainty of human performance factors by considering a hydrodynamic analysis of the structure along with a subjective analysis of human activities under different weather conditions subsequently a model based on dynamic bayesian approach is developed to evaluate the time duration effect on human performance throughout the operation the developed methodology has been applied to a case study of an offshore vessel storing extracted oil the framework demonstrates that probability of human failure increases towards the end of its operational days however the high variation in human reliability is greatly dependent on weather conditions the present study is able to improve the safety of human life in marine operations by predicting the reliability of performances as a function of time during a specific operation keywords human error harsh environment dynamic bayesian network failure rate 1 introduction human error is one of the main causes of failure in everyday functioning it is connected to human behavior that is considered undesirable and somehow unpredictable due to the high uncertainty involved in human performance when changes occur in the environment and working area of any operation from standard condition to non standard condition such as a harsh environment human error plays an imperative part in operational failure controlling the health of the operation is a challenging task and is subject to various uncertainties and sources of failure in technical organizational and human activities amongst these general classifications human performance has a high failure rate zipoli et al 2018 islam et al 2017a abaei et al 2017 bahootoroody et al 2016 islam et al 2018b and involves much uncertainty due to lack of supporting empirical evidence hence developing a precise framework to model the uncertainty of human performance is essential to mitigate risk of human failure during marine operations in a harsh environment risk assessment should be considered in design construction maintenance and operation to enhance the safety and reliability of marine and offshore structures noroozi et al 2014 however risk assessment is associated with various uncertainties that have a severe economic impact on projects due to potential failures lack of adequate information about previous failures and useful data for developing a probability model are the main impediment in the assessment and quantifying of operational risks moreover selection of an appropriate quantitated risk methodology that best represents human error uncertainty in a complex situation is challenging khan et al 2015 identified three main sources of information required for component failure estimation which are 1 expert judgment 2 experience and knowledge data accumulated from a local field and 3 data and information shared across industries operating in a harsh environment however human beings cannot be regarded as a component in estimating the failure by just using data mining or experience due to the high level of uncertainty associated with human performance in system reliability the component is referred to as a structural or technical system such as crane electrical chip boards and dynamic positioning dp system all these components are necessarily involved with human activities and to prevent the unexpected failures due to human error their imperative role should not be neglected therefore it is essential to quantify human error by considering the human performance shaping factor psf using either expert judgment or real simulation both results in a great deal of uncertainty for computing human error probability hep there is no guarantee that the expert team will consider all aspects of human error especially in a harsh environment where there is a lack of sufficient experience this means that there may still be a chance of existing unpredicted sources of human error despite precise monitoring being carried out to detect all potential failures in a system hep assessment techniques have initially been based on research in the nuclear industry and most of them have been developed based on expert judgment techniques these techniques include successive likelihood index method slim technique for human error rate prediction therp justified human error data information jhedi and human error assessment and reduction technique heart kirwan et al 1997 kirwan 1997 noroozi et al 2010 a great deal of research to assess heps using the aforementioned methods has been undertaken by many researchers abbassi et al 2015 dimattia 2005 miller and swain 1986 noroozi et al 2013 2014 raafat and abdouni 1987 zamanali et al 1992 however at a glance it is clear that the main focus of previous studies has been to evaluate a stationary process of human error regardless of duration of human activities although the assumption of neglecting the variation in human activity over a longer period could be generally true under normal conditions it can lead to underestimated results as site environments change quickly in a harsh environment therefore it is essential to understand what the trend of human reliability is in the case of time dependent parameters included in probability estimation and how human performance will be affected by a harsh environment in recent years bayesian network methodology has been developed in the field of artificial intelligence nielsen and jensen 2009 it is common agreement that this causal network based method is a powerful tool to calculate the probability of events given the observation evidence of other events in the same network based on graph theory ghosh 2008 recently bayesian networks bn and dynamic bayesian networks dbns have been widely used in engineering decision strategy leoni et al 2019 abaei et al 2018b bahootoroody et al 2019 arzaghi et al 2017 bhandari et al 2016 friis hansen 2000 khakzad et al 2011 dbn offers a flexible probabilistic network to model time dependencies of a set of random variables in time domain hosseini and takahashi 2007 takahashi nakata 2006 friis hansen 2000 in the present study a model using bn is developed to assess the influencing parameters that cause human failure as a function of time under different environmental conditions for this purpose to model the effect of extreme response and human feedback during an operation in a harsh environment a real simulation of a floating structure is considered further to model the effect of time on human performance a human reliability framework is developed based on the dynamic bayesian approach to estimate the effect of human fatigue on hep during the specific time of marine operations under three different weather conditions the outcome of this research is allowing industries to understand the reliability of human performance as a function of time and the ability to improve the safety of human life in marine operations 2 methodology development the imperative role of human error on the performance of a system has been considered in previous studies this study develops a novel methodology to evaluate human performance on a floating structure for a distinct time in marine and offshore operations subjected to the harsh environment the present framework proposes a dbn to consider different aspects of influencing factors that cause human failure a schematic illustration of the proposed methodology is illustrated in fig 1 2 1 determining human reliability function human performance can improve due to increase in knowledge and experience however over a lengthy period of a specific operational time human error will increase due to critical level of fatigue in this case dynamic analysis of human performance is necessary to understand time variation of human reliability during the operational time at the early stage of the project with respect to the entire time of the operation labor is not expected to be a considerable error however performance will be notably affected towards the final stage of the working period due to high level of fatigue or change in environmental conditions as recommended by stewart 1992 existing error rate data for human error in engineering problems are mainly considered as the average error rate the computation of the average error rate is based on the assumption that each human error is totally independent of other error events and that the error rate is constant therefore the probability of human error can be represented in the discrete format of binomial distribution or continues format of exponential distribution with constant failure rate stewart 1992 in order to include the effect of time on human error an exponential distribution nielsen and jensen 2009 is applied to estimate the human reliability 1 r t 1 exp Î» t t o h t 2 h t 1 t t o 0 t t 0 where Î» is a constant failure rate for the exponential distribution h t is heaviside step function to consider the fact that human reliability has meaning only for the operation that t t 0 and t 0 is the time that the operation will start 2 2 dbn implementation to updated hep a dynamic bayesian approach is considered to model human reliability over time in different weather conditions a brief overview on bayesian networks bns is discussed in pearl and russel 1988 while a more comprehensive theoretical background on bn is found in pearl 1988 and nielsen and jensen 2009 moreover many software packages are available for the computation of bns as discussed in murphy and russell 2001 in the following paragraph a brief introduction on dbn is provided as a tool to study the effect of time on human failures over a specified period dbn is an extension of ordinary bn that is used for evaluating a set of random variables over a discretized time line dbn can be interpreted as a generalization of markov process models which have commonly been applied for the modeling of deterioration as described in straub 2009 markov deterioration processes are explained as conditional dependency and independency over time for a given condition at time t 1 therefore the condition at any further time t i 1 t i is statistically independent of the condition of any previous time step t i 1 t i accordingly each sequence of time slice consists of one or more bn nodes the slices are connected by directed link from nodes in slice i to nodes in slice i 1 correspondingly a node at time slice i 1 can be conditionally dependent on its parents at the previous time slices i and the present time i 1 simultaneously the conditional probability table for a set of stochastic variables x at each time step is then expressed as p x i 1 x i p a x i 1 p a x i finally the joint distribution of a set of x random variables in i 1 time step will be achieved as a consequence of bayes rule nielsen and jensen 2009 as explained in equation 3 3 p x i 1 j 1 m x j i 1 x j i p a x j i 1 p a x j i i 1 n j 1 m where i is the time step that joint distribution is supposed to be computed from previous time slice while j is the number of bn nodes associated with next time slice to consider conditional dependencies and independencies states of any system described as a dbn satisfy the markovian condition that assumes that the state of a system at time t i depends only on its immediate past at t i 1 straub 2009 in this study a fatigue model based on the dbn is developed to predict human behavior in marine operations due to the long term on board activities for this purpose the factors that have imperative effects on causing human fatigue are considered in this study as suggested by islam et al 2017a 2018a and represented as human performance shaping factors psfs the most important shaping factors that can cause human fatigue are 1 weather condition f1 defined as the long term occurrence of extreme wave heights hs and zero up crossing wave period ts in a harsh environment 2 ship motion f2 defined as the critical response of the vessel encountering extreme wave heights 3 noise and vibration f3 and 4 work environment f4 defined as the condition that makes the situation intolerable for the personnel on board each of these psfs should be assigned probability of occurrence to represent the uncertainties that involve these factors these probabilities can be derived either from simulation or expert judgment depending on the type of psf and the availability of the historic data abaei et al 2018c islam et al 2017b in this study the probability table for the root nodes of f1 and f2 i e hydrodynamic related psfs are obtained based on the proposed hydrodynamic framework developed by the previous work of the same authors of this study abaei et al 2018c for an offshore operation in a harsh environment for this purpose a numerical model was developed to simulate a storm condition for evaluating performance of marine floating structures as a basis for human tolerance under the extreme responses the floating structure subjected to the storm and the behavior of the vessel was examined to see whether it was in safe condition or when it exceeded its survival limit conditions for human as a result an intensifying wave train was considered for modeling dynamic behaviour of the structure and consequently for evaluating human performance on the floating structure the developed storm condition adopted was for an extensive range of intensity level of encountering waves the approach has the capability to be applied for critical analysis to any type of marine structure including commercial displacement vessels which are subjected to storm also it is helpful for performing human risk and reliability analysis while operating on marine structures and for improving safety of the crews on board in a harsh environment abaei et al 2018c the logical probabilities for other factors f3 and f4 are derived from the expert judgment exemplified by islam et al 2017a for similar marine operations an illustrative dbn of the proposed methodology to estimate the human fatigue reliability over time in marine operations is represented in fig 2 2 3 construction of conditional probability tables cpts to implement the dbn model for human fatigue inference the network needs to be parametrized with logical numbers that represent the probability for the root nodes and the conditional probabilities for the link the probabilities for the root nodes are estimated based on hydrodynamic analysis and using the expert judgment process as mentioned in section 2 2 however computing the conditional probability tables for the fatigue nodes is not an easy process as it is a subjective estimation and there is no relationship available for these nodes although it is common to obtain such probabilities from statistical analysis of a large amount of training data it is not recommended by ji et al 2006 cooper herskovits 1992 for human reliability assessment however based on recent studies on large scale subjective surveys ji et al 2006 rosekind et al 2000 sherry 2000 for parametrizing the bn model a noisy or principle does provide a favorable solution the noisy or model has three assumptions the first being is its causal inhibition this is based on three assumptions 1 a cause effect relation between the parameters 2 exception independence which means that each cause is mutually exclusive and 3 accountability which assumes an event can happen if and only if at least one cause has occurred neapolitan 2004 these assumptions help to introduce conditional probability tables for the model in the noisy or principle all states of the node f1 f2 fn can be defined in a binary format these states represent all possible conditions of a variable e g fatigue yes or fatigue no therefore any event such as f i yes will cause human fatigue unless an inhibitor or a preventing factor prevents the error in human performance finally the probability q i is defined as ji et al 2006 4 1 j n q i p f a t i g u e n o f 1 f 2 f i f n therefore the noisy or model assumes that the presence of each shaping factor such as extreme roll response of the vessel f2 extreme roll angle is sufficient to produce the presence of human fatigue and its effect is independent of the presence of other causes the same subjectivity representation is recommended by islam et al 2017a and ji et al 2006 in other words the presence of fatigue will trigger human malfunction if one of the influence factors occurs this assumption is reasonable in reality although it is a subjective point of view as investigated by chen and moan 2004 in addition previous studies demonstrated this point from the conducted experiments and expert judgments that each of these psfs can independently cause human error ji et al 2006 chen et al 2004 a graphical representation of the noisy or principle is illustrated in fig 3 the concept for modeling the dbn in terms of simulating human fatigue over time is that the previous time slices are connected to the corresponding nodes at current time for analyzing conjugate behavior of temporal human performance as a result the previous nodes will provide diagnostic information for the corresponding human activity at currenttime thus fatigue at current time is inferred from fatigue at the previous time along with current observations ji et al 2006 this concept will allow estimation of human error over the time by transferring subjective information in the node for the next time period in each time slice the fatigue model is expanded dynamically with addition temporal links that connect to the intermediate nodes at the previous time slice and to the corresponding nodes at current time slice the cpts for the structural responses and human performance are derived from and based on hydrodynamic simulations and expert judgment respectively however transitional probabilities over the time for modeling dbn are specified subjectively for their framework related to the driver fatigue model as suggested by ji et al 2006 due to lack of available data for human activities in marine operations the process for construction of cpt is always a crucial step this is a particularly thorough process especially for the factors that have no physic basis such as f3 and f4 as a result it is necessary to rely on the survey data gathered from expert judgment by conducting a questionnaire survey among experienced seafarers around the world as presented by islam et al 2017a in this approach there are three steps to construct the cpt table first a questionnaire should be developed to determine the impact of desired child nodes variables second a survey method such as monkey link should be created to conduct the data collection and third the collected data needs to be translated to a probability to represent the cpt for the desired links in the probability network in this study cpt table is constructed based on the conducted survey by islam et al 2017a the other factors relating to the hydrodynamic performance of the vessel will be obtained based on the stochastic analysis of the structure and a designed wave profile the results are then extracted and changed to a probability model with a proper limit identified to understand the tolerable level for human performance on the vessel 3 application of the methodology case study 3 1 scenario development to illustrate different steps in the methodology a practical case study is considered for evaluation of human reliability during marine operation on a sevan 1000 floating storage unit fsu encountering a harsh environment this structure has been designed to operate in the mariner field in the north sea hanssen 2013 the structure is a storage unit incorporating a main hull with overall length of 85 m and draft of 30 m a part of the case study investigates human performance based on the extreme response of the vessel when subjected to different incident waves to model the hydrodynamic based psf nodes see fig 3 for this purpose the criteria and the operational limits similar to chen et al 2004 and hanssen 2013 will be applied to translate the effect of structural response on reasonable human reliability therefore the structure will be simulated in an actual harsh environment subjected to a stochastic wave train a safe level will then be considered for human activity on board to evaluate a true condition of human failure during the operation the other factors will be modeled based on expert judgment and the available precursor data for the marine operation 3 2 results and discussions with increase in the duration of human activity in the operation the uncertainty of human performance increases notably which is necessary when considering time varying effect of human error in reliability assessment based on maritime labor convention mlc the number of working hours on ships should be 8 h a day lillie 2008 under normal circumstances with one day of rest and a maximum of 14 h in any 24 h period in general mlc recommends a short term strategy that working hours on ships should not exceed 49 h per week however these rules are still not considered as having reliable strategies for evaluating the long term prediction of human performance during an extended operations time as suggested by ji et al 2006 it is necessary to estimate human endurance to understand how individuals will gradually become exhausted with an increase in time to return labor to normal conditions a long term reliability estimation should be performed to analyse the maximum endurance of human performance this will assist individuals to be granted a proper rest period to prevent build up of human fatigue therefore in this study a period of 100 days is considered to evaluate performance of human ability when remaining on board in the proposed dbn 5 different time slices are considered for modeling human fatigue in order to obtain the hydrodynamic

23034,aquatic robotics is making a critical transition to adapt and inspire more efficient systems from nature the result is the abandonment of inefficient propeller based locomotion for a biological locomotion type suitable for the specific mission bioinspired aquatic unmanned vehicles auvs could be exploited in a diverse range of missions depending on the design and its capabilities removing the human pilot and creating an animal based auv means that more hazardous aquatic environments can be studied with reduced repercussions there is a diverse range of biological locomotion s to choose from when developing a bioinspired auv the respective animals that exhibit a specific swimming mode give a range of criteria to follow make the system more capable of swimming in this review how previous auv developers determined the kinematic physical and hydrodynamic modeling of these systems are consolidated and discussed all types of developed actuators are reviewed organized and explained based on their materials and motion capabilities the electronic components of these systems are outlined to give an idea of how these bioinspired auvs are constructed then it is discussed what makes these

robotic systems are being adapted to perform complex missions in aqueous environments blindberg 2001 colgate and lynch 2004 habib 2013 wettergreen et al 1998 raj and thakur 2016 murphy and haroutunian 2011 aquatic unmanned vehicles auvs alternatively referred to as unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs are receiving growing interest because of their potential to replace current aquatic tethered systems colgate and lynch 2004 murphy and haroutunian 2011 currently aquatic robots are inefficient at moving because of their shape use of propellers for thrust and tethered control blindberg 2001 murphy and haroutunian 2011 interest into the adaptation of biological motion creates robots which are capable at swimming like fish these robots can perform routine swimming missions that would be considered hostile for hominid and outdated robotic investigations raj and thakur 2016 scaradozzi et al 2017a yen and azwadi 2015 cruz et al 1999 clarification into the development of previous auvs is needed to gain a better understanding so more optimized unmanned systems can be designed in the future auvs can be applied in a range of missions for both civilian and military purposes missions include

murphy and haroutunian 2011 with the potential for swarming based missions auvs could be exploited in collaborative missions that cover more space locations munasinghe et al 2017 currently aquatic systems consider a rigid boxlike or torpedo structure equipped with propellers and are controlled through use of a tether blindberg 2001 however these systems have difficulty maneuvering in close quarter environments and are inefficient in comparison with fish habib 2013 murphy and haroutunian 2011 the tether is cumbersome and makes it hard to maneuver as it has potential for getting snagged on obstacles which can result in the failure of the mission this causes the need for more natural and free moving systems that can complete a complex mission some systems have been equipped with non propeller based thrust a positive step forward guizzo 2008 rico et al 2017 the new auvs have been designed using actuation mechanism materials sensors and batteries that condone bioinsipiration and

express better turning endurance and speed than robotic systems in fig 1 b circle size is a cost of transport function taking into account the energy expended to swim per body mass the larger biological animals require less energy to swim and have much higher endurance studies have been conducted where the focus has been placed on analyses and validations of auvs that are capable of

move during swimming caudal fin animals utilize an oscillating body flexion to actuate the tail which is known as body caudal fin bcf locomotion scaradozzi et al 2017a sfakiotakis et al 1999 lauder 2015 zhou et al 2017 utilization of a caudal fin allows species to achieve fast speed sfakiotakis et al 1999 the animals in this class generally bony and have a spinal structure to support the body fin undulation species excite individual rib structures in the fin to cause undulations along the fin length certain species in the rajiform gymnotiform and balistiform category are capable of forward and reverse swimming directions depending on the wave direction this class is a mixture of bony and cartilaginous animals body structures vary greatly depending on the species selected jet propulsion animals contract their bodies to forcibly expel water from an internal cavity the body of these animals lack rigid structure so complex musculature gives the body motion and support there are many combinations between these three main categories each with their own unique method of locomotion 3 kinematic and dynamic modeling to create models for the characteristics of biological systems various methods are used it can be found that there are a multitude of swimming styles expressed by aquatic animals this includes but is not limited to animals that use caudal fins pectoral fins dorsal or anal fins these fins can either perform oscillatory or undulatory motions to produce thrust for jet propulsion animals compress water by clenching a mantel or bell these different swimming styles require specific motions to generate the required thrust for the auvs these models give the required motion for surfaces so thrust can be optimized 3 1 kinematic modeling kinematic modeling is obtained through the observation of living specimens these living specimens give the motion and velocity characteristics for the body moreover this methodology helps to obtain shape of propulsion surfaces and body distinct criteria of the individual species can then be replicated when designing an actuation mechanism methods for biological observation include body and fin marker tracking using cameras in a controlled environment like a water channel or static fluid tank 3 1 1 fin oscillation kinematic modeling spinal flexion modeling is considered for animals that utilize a caudal fin shown in fig 4 mpf motion has been tracked for fishes in the labriform and ostraciiform subcategories where models for these cases are based on the fin edge shown in fig 5 biological motion is created for species through the complex retraction and relaxation of the muscles along body fig 4 b is a representation of one complete cycle for a carangiform fish it can be noted that muscle activation initiates behind the head to the tail peduncle the more flexible anguilliform species express more alterations between the lengthening and shorting of their lateral muscles expressing more than one wave period gillis 1996 videler et al 2001 mpf fishes do not require the large lateral muscle activation as these fins have more localized muscle around the fin westneat 1996 fig 6 is a marker spinal curvature model which gives one phase in propulsive cycle by determining the motion of the spine the most basic motion can be extracted for each type of caudal fin motion for anguilliform the spinal curvature is more complex as the body performs larger wave amplitudes and also have multiple periods over the body length the subcarangiform and carangiform have similar body undulation but the subcarangiform has greater head amplitude to initiate the body undulation sfakiotakis et al 1999 thunniform fishes have the smallest head amplitudes while the body undulation is restricted to the peduncle these types of oscillations are modeled using a combination of different sinusoidal curves with varying amplitudes colgate and lynch 2004 scaradozzi et al 2017a yu et al 2016a cui et al 2017 clapham and hu 2014 liu et al 2005 bergmann and lollo 2011 khalid et al 2016 these models are usually constructed using a quadratic polynomial function as an envelope for a sinusoidal wave as shown in eq 1 1 y x t a 0 a 1 x a 2 x 2 sin Ï t k x the polynomial function expresses the amplitude envelope of the lateral motion of the spine as a function of space the wave number k of the body undulations that corresponds to the wave length and angular frequency are considered in the sinusoidal term borazjani and sotiropoulos 2010 the terms a 0 a 1 and a 2 are coefficients of the amplitude envelope the tracking for mpf swimmers requires an understanding of the fin motion due to fin rotation during power and recovery stroke multiple markers are used to track both the leading and trailing edges respectively as shown in fig 5 a labriforms are capable of different types of propulsive fin stroke performing flapping or rowing motions as presented in fig 5 b d shown for the flapping motion the power stroke occurs on the downstroke while the power stroke for the rowing motion occurs when the fin is pulled back recovery during the rowing motion is much more drastic as the fin transitions to a flat position to the fluid flow to minimize drag flapping is carried out by the leading edge plunging the greatest distance in the y direction compared to the trailing edge as shown in fig 5 b and c walker and westneat 1997 walker and westneat 2002 the angle of the flapping stroke is along vertical axis perpendicular to the body where the rowing stroke is more of a lateral plane to the body walker and westneat 2002 shown in fig 5 e the fin tip displacement for the rowing motion can occur at a certain angle of attack depending on the swimming speed and control the animal desires these motions are more difficult to model as swimming gait transitions for different speeds numerical methods like those considered by shoele et al shoele and zhu 2010 have shown that it is possible to model some of the swimming motions of a labriform flapping is mostly used for slower speed swimming while a rowing motion is used for higher speeds walker and westneat 2002 sitorus et al 2009 however once the muscles for pectoral locomotion are exhausted these animals can utilize a bcf locomotion to maintain speed davison 1988 there are a few auvs that consider the caudal fin in the labriform design higher emphasis is put on the pectoral motion ostraciiforms use the pectoral dorsal anal and sometimes the caudal fin depending on the species the pectoral fins and single dorsal and anal fin are primarily used at lower speeds while the caudal fin can be used at higher speeds wang et al 2013 same as the labriform the higher the speed the more lateral the flapping motion hove et al 2001 wang et al 2014 the dorsal and anal fins should be synonymous with a flapping motion as the leading edge of the fin performs the greatest plunging amplitude the dorsal and anal fins are used for increased stability as they correct yaw and roll for these fishes 3 1 2 fin undulation kinematic modeling animals in this class use a flexible fin membrane as propulsive surfaces the support structures of these fins are often ribs whose flexibility depends on the species traveling undulatory waves of these fins need to be studied as they create thrust to move the body forward and stabilize the animal while it swims wave amplitude and frequency are unique for each species considering the fin undulation category sfakiotakis et al sfakiotakis et al 1999 described the translational wave that these animals initiate causes perpendicular and parallel force to the fin base these forces are what give these animals their unique stability and maneuvering capabilities lauder 2015 the rajiform category contains animals like the cownose ray and manta ray shown in fig 7 a the leading fin edge performs a greater plunging amplitude relative to the trailing edge while the surface of the fin can exhibit a traveling wave where the fin motion appears as oscillatory but the flexibility of the fin over its span makes it undulatory the flapping motion of the manta ray is similar to the labriform flapping motion but the larger cartilaginous pectoral fin is for sure more flexible videography helped to discretize the specific flapping motion for a cownose ray as shown in fig 7 b and c zheng et al 2010 the stingray also a rajiform exhibits a different undulation wave compared to the cownose ray as it uses isolated wave propagations along the fin span to swim the multiple wave propagations along the fin is shown in fig 8 a and b work by blevins et al blevins and lauder 2012 bottom et al bottom et al 2016 and daniel daniel 1988 describe how to model the three degree of freedom wave propagation expressed by rajiform species the modeling of the fin curvature was done using marker lines with multiple points that are perpendicular to the spine as presented in fig 8 c these extremely flexible fins are capable of multi directional wave propagation waves can translate from front to back and vice versa each fin can behave independently of the other each fin displaying its own wave direction allowing these animals to make null speed turns for amiiform and gymnotiform individual ribs and a flexible interstitial membrane make these fins extremely flexible and allow multiple periods to be expressed by the fins xiong and lauder 2013 sprinkle et al 2017 work by hu et al hu et al 2009 and youngerman et al youngerman et al 2014 are good examples of videography and modeling of amiiform and gymnotiform locomotion as depicted in fig 9 a and b respectively youngerman et al sprinkle et al 2017 described four different swimming styles for a gymnotiform and the corresponding wave propagations used in forward backward vertical and roll swimming each swimming style requires a specific wave propagation frequency amplitude and direction shown in fig 9 c a traveling wave for forward swimming changing position over time is marked by the dashed line efforts by hu et al hu et al 2009 model the ribbon fin kinematics of the amiiform which is synonymous with the gymnotiform flexibility of fin ribs and membrane is shown in fig 9 d 3 1 3 jet propulsion kinematic modeling the jet propulsion category is unique in that the whole body is flexible these animals do not have a rigid skeleton or rib structure therefore these creatures are entirely soft bodied however complex musculature structure allows these animals to contract and create thrust for jet propulsion the shape deformation is modeled to determine the volume displacement as shown in fig 10 the bell of the jellyfish has been observed for the flexion curves analyzed from the oblate and prolate shapes oblate jellyfish are described by a flatter shape with a large bell radius prolate jellyfish have more of a bullet shape where radii and body sizes are smaller than oblate jellyfish jellyfish produce the bell motion through constriction of muscles in the subumbrella allowing them to eject water out of the semi enclosed volume of their bell as explained by mchenry and jed mchenry and jed 2003 and dabiri et al dabiri et al 2005 jellyfish s motion consists of continuous contraction and relaxation phases oblate jellyfish are known to generate thrust by paddle swimming characterized by none symmetric bell constrictions prolate jellyfish have symmetric bell constriction often at a much higher frequency than the oblate the aurelia aurita exhibits both cases of the oblate and prolate swimming styles making them good candidates for observation fig 10 b allows for a clear observation of the contraction and relaxation phases created from the body markers in the videography experiments for aurelia aurita jellyfish as depicted in fig 10 a other subsections of the jet propulsion classification are the mantel constriction and combination of fin undulation with mantel constriction mantel constriction is expressed solely by animals like the octopus this animal utilizes inhalation of water into a mantel cavity and forcibly expelling it from a siphon creating thrust the combination class of mantel constriction and fin undulation pertains to animals that utilize the same mantel constriction as the octopus but also have undulatory fins capable for slow motion control biological species in this category are the squid and cuttlefish bartol et al bartol et al 2001 described the swimming behavior of the squid lolliguncula brevis by using video frames as shown in fig 11 a and b mantel constriction is achieved by the contraction of three directional muscle weave in the mantel johnson et al 1972 the mantel can fill more than twenty percent compared to the relaxed state and can expel this water till the mantel is more than fifteen percent smaller than the relaxed state johnson et al 1972 the cycle of mantel constriction is shown in fig 11 c bortal et al bartol et al 2001 also described that the squid uses its undulator fin in forward and backward swimming jet propulsion is primarily utilized in backward swimming for fast escapes weymouth et al 2015 3 2 physical modeling the physical modeling of the system is done most often through a theoretical assumption of the hydrodynamic parameters that partake in the swimming motion namely thrust and drag parameters of interest for studies are the reynolds re and strouhal st numbers which are a function of the frequencies investigators like cui et al hove et al 2001 define these parameters for carangiform fish and result in the following equations 2 r e l 2 t Ï where Ï is the kinematic viscosity t 1 f as t is the beating period and l denotes the fish length as for the strouhal number its expression is given in eq 4 where a m a x represents the maximum tail amplitude of oscillation and u is the speed of the fluid when the body is considered to be traveling at null speed cui et al 2017 tolkoff 1999 3 s t f a max u the lift and drag forces can be found through a simplified numerical or experimental analysis if the pressure and shear stress distribution are known over a studied shape then these forces can be found through eqs 5 and 6 as follows munson et al 2013 4 f d r a g f d p r e s s u r e f d v i s c o u s p cos Î¸ d a Ï w sin Î¸ d a 5 f l i f t f l p r e s s u r e f l v i s c o u s p sin Î¸ d a Ï w cos Î¸ d a these equations account for the effects of pressure differences and the viscous effects induced by the shape by integrating to get the total respective force in a coordinate direction munson et al 2013 these terms are most commonly found for airfoils abbott and doenhoff 1959 but more detailed force approximations are being made for objects of complex shape batchelor 2000 vasudev et al 2014 here the pressure p over the surface and the wall shear stress Ï w from the fluid moving past the surface abbott and doenhoff 1959 for assumed shapes coefficients for lift and drag can be approximated using eqs 7 and 8 munson et al 2013 for neutrally buoyant bodies lift from fins can be important for depth and roll control 6 c d f d r a g Ï u 2 a 2 7 c l f l i f t Ï u 2 a 2 one of the easiest assumptions that can be made for physical modeling can be to assume the shape of the body or fin to be similar to an airfoil this assumption has been made for fin oscillation and fin undulation categories khalid et al 2016 blevins and lauder 2012 moored and bart smith prats 2015 however this assumption is most commonly made for fin oscillation bergmann and lollo 2011 thrust production has been studied not only for an oscillating airfoil but also for a finite shape with flexibility over the span or chord length bergmann and lollo 2011 khalid et al 2016 an airfoil inspired robot using a rigid body oscillation to generate thrust is considered by pollard et al pollard and tallapragada 2017 4 hydrodynamic analyses the hydrodynamic analyses can be done using numerical or experimental methods these methods are used to better understand either the two dimensional or rather the three dimensional flows schosser et al 2016 numerical methods are considered for fins or body to determine flow characteristics ramamurti et al 2002 cui et al 2017 bottom et al 2016 prats 2015 tytell 2004 li et al 2016 liu et al 2012 liu et al 2015 hirata et al 2015 kodati et al 2008 studebaker et al 2016 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2008 fish et al 2016 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 the most simplified numerical method that investigated undulatory swimming motion is the waving plate theory wu 1961 techet et al 2004 analyses are performed using the governing equations for fluid flow which are given by abbott and doenhoff 1959 8 v 0 9 Ï t Ï u x Ï v y Ï w z 0 10 Ï u t u u x v u y w u z p x Ï g x Î¼ 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 2 u z 2 where eq 9 is the boundary condition for an incompressible flow eq 10 is the general continuity equation for the fluid and eq 10 is the general navier stokes equation in cartesian coordinates accounting for the flow in the x direction equation 10 also has two other equations that account for the y and z directions numerical methods can be performed using a multitude of capable software including but not limited to openfoam ltd 2011 2018 and ansys cfx ansys 2018 experimental analysis of fluid flow has been conducted in a still water and flow channel using high speed cameras capable of capturing fluid dynamics fermigier 2017 lauder 2011 behbahani and tan 2017 particle image velocimetry piv a form of pulse light velocimetry experiments have been conducted to study the effects that shapes have on a fluid by studying the velocity of particles in the fluid regime being displaced by the shape as shown in fig 12 ren et al 2015 lauder et al 2007 wen and lauder 2013 westerweel 1997 adrian 1991 lauder et al 2005 this imaging method is performed using 10 9 5 11 5 particles in every cubic meter krothapalli 1991 another imaging strategy based on smaller marker size is molecular markers like fluorescent ink which can be tracked for individual streamlines and vortices created adrian 1991 yamamoto 2017 a molecular marker experiment was considered for the jellyfish to gather the definite movement of its bell and the vortices the constriction creates dabiri et al 2005 through identification of particle velocity using piv fluid flow characteristics can be determined for the structure of interest fig 12 shows different fluid flow for a bcf fish swimming and one lateral pectoral fin for one instant of that motion piv yields areas of higher and lower pressure over the body the vortices produced and are helpful in determining the force generated by the body babu et al 2016 5 actuators by defining the actuators in categories based on their construction clear motion characteristics can be displayed groupings of rigid soft and biological components give examples for all the actuators considered as shown in fig 13 in the rigid actuator category the conventional actuators are described as linked systems that try to replicate the motion of spinal or fin rib structures the soft actuator category covers soft robotic actuators that could be considered in found systems biological actuators are expressed in brief detail as this is the newest category and is still highly experimental 5 1 rigid link actuators the linked systems are considered when the overall components do not deform in size and shape actuation is achieved through linkages of rigid component assemblies using electrical motors raj and thakur 2016 the conception of rigid component actuators capable of performing found motions from the biological or hydrodynamic analyses result in a great variety of designs these rigid actuators are categorized as follows single link multiple link and fin actuators table 1 at the end of this section gives examples for each rigid actuator section 5 1 1 single link actuator the single link systems are categorized for the caudal peduncle movement shown in fig 14 this actuator can either have the drive motor in the body or tail section these actuators are favorable because the thrust is generated from a simple assembly the reason this actuator type is considered for the thunniform species because the body undulation expressed by these creatures is restricted to the last section of the peduncle kopman and porfiri 2013 marras and porfiri 2012 this peduncle restriction is also expressed by the osctraciiform and labriform auv tail motion wang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 lachat et al 2006 behbahani and tan 2016 wang and xie 2014 5 1 2 multiple link actuator the multi link actuators give the peduncle a smoother curvature compared to the single link shown in fig 15 the more links used in the actuation the smoother the curve is as each link equivalates to an increase in joints the joints can be designed to have a single plane of freedom where the peduncle unit can move in a lateral or vertical motion relative to the bodies neutral position respectively clapham and hu 2014 liu et al 2005 tolkoff 1999 suebsaiprom et al 2016 hu et al 2006 liu and hu 2010 yu et al 2004 koca et al 2016 yu et al 2012 ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 liu and hu 2005 su et al 2014 wen et al 2012 yu et al 2016b liljeback et al 2014 shen et al 2011 anderson and chhabra 2002 stefanini et al 2012 the anguilliform category has the highest number of links usually more than six while the carangiform category regularly has five however one of the pioneer experimental designs the robotuna used more than five links powered by pulleys to achieve oscillation tolkoff 1999 power inputs for the multi link actuators are either the direct current dc motors or servomotors housed on each of these joints or at the base of the peduncle chu and zhu 2016 a unique multi link anguilliform robot was created using magnets to attract and repulse each link manfredi et al 2013 multi link actuators allow the inclusion of joints that can give the tail another degree of freedom for more flexibility a more flexible peduncle gives the tail more directional thrust capabilities and therefore more maneuvering capabilities ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 yu and wei 2013 yu et al 2009 rollinson et al 2014 5 1 3 fin actuators the fin actuators are considered for the systems that mimic rajiform labriform and ostraciiform species these systems vary between rib actuators and rigid paddle fin actuators the rib actuators give the wave propagation along the fin while the paddle fin considers the surface to be rigid the flexibility of ribs is dependent on the material but this actuator is included in this class because designs follow similar methodology as link systems paddle fin actuators have been used for control during swimming 5 1 3 1 rib actuators rib actuators are considered for systems that use individual rays to excite a flexible membrane as shown in fig 16 the rib actuators can be considered in three categories connected individual and passive the connected ribbed actuators are considered for systems by xie et al 2016 siahmansouri et al 2011 liu et al 2017 individual ribs are considered by hu et al 2009 yang et al 2009 zhou and low 2012 low et al 2011 shang et al 2012 curet et al 2011 these ribs are actuated through separate servomotors thus these systems have more than two actuators as presented fig 16 passive fins are considered by liu et al 2012 gao et al 2007 niu et al 2012 y alvarado et al 2013 chew et al 2015 sfakiotakis and fasoulas 2014 gilva et al 2015 these auvs have one or two rigid rib actuators that give undulation to a passive fin membrane flexible fin rays were found to increase the efficiency of undulating fin propulsion as it replicated the biological animal liu et al 2017 5 1 3 2 paddle fin actuators the paddle fin actuators are considered for the pectoral fin propulsion and the control surfaces of bcf auvs the pectoral fin propulsive actuators are considered for the auvs created by sitorus et al 2009 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 kodati et al 2008 lachat et al 2006 behbahani and tan 2016 zhang et al 2016 mainong et al 2017 wang et al 2017a castano et al 2017 the unique paddle fin created by zhang et al low and willy 2005 not only has propulsive pectoral fins but also has a dual caudal fin propulsion that gives this auv good stability and speed the auv created by kodati et al kodati et al 2008 supports propulsive pectoral fins that have two degrees of freedom to perform the rowing swimming method similar to the work of behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 as shown in fig 17 fins with 3 dof are desired these give the auv s more maneuvering capabilities shen et al 2011 the control surface paddle fin actuators are considered because they give the craft pitch and roll capabilities wen et al 2012 anderson and chhabra 2002 wu et al 2015 to obtain 3 dof for each fin a servomotor for each degree of freedom can be applied in the design shen et al 2011 it was described by behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2017 that a variable stiffness paddle fin exhibits much different performance characteristics than a rigid fin 5 1 4 motors and servomotors direct current motors are considered for these designs as they allow for strong torque and high rotational speeds servomotors are also used because they can be rotary or linear actuators furqan et al 2017 a common method to transform the mechanical input of the dc motors into oscillations is to use a scotch yoke mechanism rack and pinion or slider crank shen et al 2011 yu and wei 2013 the fin undulation uses gear sets to transform the servomotors into useful motion wang et al 2017b typical motors used for actuation are found in table 2 5 2 soft robotic actuators soft materials have been exploited in almost all categories of locomotion from all the known soft robotic actuators sras there are a few types that are capable of motions needed for swimming the various forms of the smart material actuators will be identified to determine systems that are capable of deformation from a stimulus like electricity the characteristics of each actuator is shown to discuss later the optimal sra candidates for auvs at the end of this section tables 3 and 4 are outlaid in a manner to express the characteristics and physical capabilities of each sra 5 2 1 shape memory alloys shape memory alloys smas are smart material actuators that have rising interest in soft robotics sma characteristics include high work density high chemical corrosion resistance deform locally in the presence of low voltages fail from cyclic fatigue movement is hysteric from the complex thermodynamic problem for phase change jani et al 2014 xiang et al 2017 cianchetti 2013 smas go through a material phase shift to use and recover strain potential of the crystalline lattice cianchetti 2013 there are different alloys used as smas including copper alloys and ternary alloys such as niticu but the most common is the nickel titanium niti alloy jani et al 2014 cianchetti 2013 the preference of this material is its super elasticity pseudoplasticity and shape memory effect shape memory effect refers to the recovery of the material s original shape after being deformed cianchetti 2013 smas can be fabricated in either a wire beam or sheet configuration cianchetti 2013 the sma actuators are continually being developed to try improving their performance xiang et al 2017 smas have been employed in a variety of soft robotic systems with different kinds of movements based on a sma wire configuration many systems developed have been inspired from worms caterpillars and octopus a support structure is needed for the sma wires as shown in fig 18 a flexible nylon mesh structure is used but other elastomers have also been implemented cianchetti et al 2012 follador et al 2012 the wires must be inlayed in this support matrix to create directional deformation and force the selection of direction depends on the flexion and recovery that is trying to be achieved circumferential and longitudinal sma wires shown in fig 18 a and b are implemented to mimic the muscles of a worm that elongate and shorten the body circumferential wires contract to decrease diameter thus lengthening the body counteractively its length is shortened by the longitudinal wires contracting which increases the diameter thus shortening the body the body does not bend it only exhibits elongation and contraction which produces a peristaltic movement cianchetti et al 2012 follador et al 2012 seok et al 2013 an octopus like robotic arm was also developed using radial and longitudinal sma springs the radial sma springs constricts the radius and increases the arm to its original length fig 18 c shows the radial system set up using sma springs asymmetric position of wire can cause bending for a respective system the i bot inspired from a caterpillar uses two sma coils on one side of the silicone body when activated independently causing an inchworm motion this motion is initiated by a bending wave in the posterior part of the system tilting the contact angle of the rear foot when the threshold angle for friction is exceeded the rear foot is dragged forwards umedachi et al 2016 another caterpillar based robot is the goqbot sma coil actuators within silicone are activated simultaneously to constrict the body into a circle causing a ballistic rolling motion trimmer et al 2013 lin et al 2011 laschi et al 2016 wang et al 2009 designed a micro mimetic manta ray robotic system actuated with sma wires running longitudinally in an elastomer beam this beam is a flexible leading edge fin rib that gives undulations to a passive fin membrane the sma causes flexion in the beam because it is inlaid in the polymer off the neutral axis and when it is activated the shrinkage causes the bending in favor of the activated side kim et al 2016 kim et al kim et al 2016 devised a design based on a polymer matrix inlaid with a plastic to encourage a vertical flexion a biomimetic cuttlefish robot designed by wang et al wang et al 2011 and fabricated by gao et al gao et al 2014 uses sma wires for the undulated fin and the mantel constriction of the system the undulatory fin serves for slow swimming while the mantle is for higher speed jet propulsion wang et al 2011 the undulating fin works using sma wires distributed throughout the membrane the sma wires in the mantel are circumferential allowing constriction of the mantel cavity gao et al 2014 another sma category named bio inspired shape memory alloy composite actuators bismac actuators was used it can convert the high force and low strain of sma wire to a lower force with larger bending deformations smith et al 2010 the structure of this actuator is composed of the most common niti alloy sma wire and a thin medium carbon steel fixed in silicone as shown in fig 19 smith et al 2010 this actuator has the ability of being configured to different deformation profiles although bismac actuator can reach a larger deformation it still has hysteresis and delay when changing to its original position villanueva et al 2010 smith et al smith et al 2010 were able to analyze the reflective points on the actuator they recorded a maximum deformation of 93 4 100 by using 4 sma wires while there was almost no change by adding 3 to 6 wires smith et al 2010 robojelly is a bioinspired jellyfish robot designed and fabricated by villanueva et al villanueva et al 2013 that replicates shape and motion of the aurelia aurita jellyfish the required deformation of 44 for the aurelia aurita using single sma wires alone it would not function to replicate the contraction since they can only deform by 4 villanueva et al 2013 the fabricated robojelly consists of 8 bismac actuators fixed inside the rtv silicone bell villanueva et al 2013 5 2 2 cable driven unlike other soft material auvs presented in this review paper cable driven auvs are powered by servomotors or gas marchese et al 2015 cai et al 2009 the function of the servomotors is to produce bending by shortening the wires which causes flexion of the skeletal structure wires on each robot have different set up depending on the kind of deformation desired fig 20 shows the longitudinal set up for a robotic fish lau et al 2015 cownose ray auv cai et al 2009 and the radial set up for an octopus inspired jet propulsion system giorgio serchi et al 2013 several robotic systems have been developed using cable driven actuation octopus sea star and caudal fin species have motions that can be replicated using this actuation robot shark is composed of an elastic beam with six rigid disc links mimicking the fish skeleton with wires running longitudinally down the peduncle as shown in fig 20 a lau et al 2015 the servomotor on the robot shark drives a drum wheel controlling the pull on the wires that cause a bending of the peduncle and oscillates by altering the rotation of the actuator a robotic fish was created in the same manner but with five discs and complaint last section of the tail with high similarity of motion to the biological zhong et al 2017 a gas power pneumatic muscle of the flexible foil cownose ray auv contracts a flexible multi section leading edge fin rib using rope running on the top side of the rib as presented in fig 20 b however this design only capable of a fin upstroke cai et al 2009 by using silicone rubber the fin span can be given the shape of the fin and giving a high morphology similarity to the biological system cai et al 2009 poseidrone inspired from an octopus combines crawling and jet propulsion mechanisms the crawling system is made of radially distributed arms each with longitudinal wires running from the motor to the tip of the arm giorgio serchi et al 2017 cables allow each arm to elongate shorten and stiffen which also allows the robot to grab objects the swimming unit consists of a silicone bladder with a nozzle and ingestion valve giorgio serchi et al 2013 this bladder is connected to radially distributed wires as shown in fig 20 c once it is filled with fluid a servomotor pulls these cables contracting the bladder thus producing ejection of the fluid causing thrust while the bladder returns to its original shape fluid is being ingested and the ejection process is repeated arienti et al 2015 giorgio serchi et al 2013 a feather sea star was the inspiration for a soft robot that is composed mostly of linear and circular springs that aid in generating propulsion francis et al 2015 nir et al 2012 5 2 3 shape memory polymers similar to smas shape memory polymers smps can deform and return to their original shape in the presence of a stimuli smps are an elastic polymer matrix with stimuli sensitive switches although not many auvs have been made using these kind of actuators they present characteristics that give them potential these actuators use other kinds of stimuli rather than electricity such as chemical light and magnetic fields the shape recovery time of smp can be a short time for a large deformation range but larger deformations risk a longer response time behl and lendlein 2007 shape memory polymers have many applications especially for micro electromechanical systems and actuators in biomedical devices trabia et al 2015 ricotti and fujie 2017 these applications include laser activated device that can remove blood clots to biodegradable implants that inflate to help control appetite to reduce obesity behl and lendlein 2007 these polymers have been considered as better substitutes to metallic materials due to their biocompatibility and flexibility giving them the capability to be used in other applications laschi and cianchetti 2014 5 2 4 electroactive polymers electroactive polymer eap actuators are excited through electrical stimulus and they are classified into electronic dielectric elastomers and ionic ionic polymer metallic composites trivedi et al 2008 eaps have characteristics such as low weight fracture tolerance and large actuation strain dielectric elastomers require high voltage to operate but they have a quicker response and produce large strains 5 2 4 1 dielectric elastomers dielectric elastomers de have resemblance to animal muscles based on strain pressure density efficiency and speed pelrine et al 2002a when voltage is applied to the electrodes the opposite charges in the electrodes attract each other generating stress in the dielectrics this stress causes deformation in the de in the form of a compression and lateral expansion mirfakhrai et al 2007 a sra inspired by a jellyfish was created using dielectric elastomers this system has an air chamber connected one end to a de membrane and the other end is a valve that pumps air in when the de expands godaba et al 2016 the de membrane is filled by a defined amount of air the de in this case is stimulated when voltage is applied on the actuator the membrane expands increasing its air volume which helps the system to float the jellyfish robot generates propulsion by ejecting water and by expanding the de membrane creating thrust 5 2 4 2 ionic polymer metallic composites ionic polymer metallic composites ipmcs can be used when deformations such as bending and twisting are needed in design trabia et al 2016 ipmc using voltage as stimuli will be explained besides electricity these materials can also be stimulated by chemicals light and magnetic fields chen et al 2012 they consist of a polyelectrolyte membrane in between metallic electrode chen et al 2012 this membrane contains a proportionate number of anions and cations in the membrane matrix when voltage is applied cations move to the negatively charged electrode causing an imbalance in the structure fig 21 shows a high concentration of cations on just one side causes the deformation in the actuator but it does not produce a strong force pelrine et al 2002a chen et al 2012 the bioinspired jellyfish robot designed and fabricated by najem et al najem et al 2012 uses ipmc actuators to mimic the propulsion of the aequorea victoria jellyfish due to its similarities with the motion of the bell to achieve the curved shape of the bell dc voltage was applied to the four ipmc najem et al 2012 a second system utilizing ipmc actuators to mimic locomotion of biological jellyfish is the biomimetic jellyfish robot designed by yeom and oh yeom and oh 2009 unlike the first robotic system the ipmc actuators for this robotic jellyfish have been given a thermal treatment of 80 c for 1 h which allowed for a better flexion yeom and oh 2009 yeom and oh yeom and oh 2009 stated that applying dc voltage to a flat ipmc actuator could not hold for a constant curvature and its return to original shape is hysteric in this design an input signal was implemented in the robot to mimic the rapid changes between the fast pulse phase and the slow recovery phase yeom and oh 2009 chen et al chen et al 2010 introduced the concept of a biomimetic robotic fish actuated by ipmc actuators a plastic caudal fin was designed to be attached to the ipmc beam to provide the thrust chen et al 2010 the implementation of a wider beam would cause a curling effect instead of bending deformation therefore the beam length is an important factor in the design chen et al 2012 robotic rajiforms also utilize ipmc in place of the rib actuators individual strips are integrated into a polymer sheet and are activated to cause the wave propagations from the sequenced bending of the ipmc chen et al chen et al 2012 created a bioinspired robotic manta ray using two pectoral fins fabricated by a single ipmc beam actuator with a passive fin membrane chen et al 2012 punning et al punning et al 2004 and takagi et al takagi et al 2006 created multi rib ipmc actuators but found that it was difficult to cause the complex wave undulations through selective activation 5 2 5 piezoelectric materials piezoelectric material is a smart material and has applications for auvs because it vibrates at lower frequencies using low voltage electric excitation applicable piezoelectric material is a macro fiber composite mfc actuator mfc materials are composed of cts wireless components 3195hd lead zirconate titanate that was bound by epoxy high and wilkie 2003 mfc has low strain properties during vibration but the stress is moderate they work as cantilever beams and have been implemented into caudal fin designs due to the oscillatory vibration this type of smart material actuators show promise because they bend in plane directions freely and do not exhibit fatigue failure during long cycles moreover this actuator does generate heat only one auv has been found to have used the piezoelectric actuator work by cen and erturk cen and erturk 2013 created a piezoelectric actuator caudal fin the piezoelectric material was fixed to a rigid body that housed all the batteries and electrical components 5 2 6 hydraulic pressure channels in an elastomer matrix are put under stress using hydraulic pressure shown in fig 22 a marchese et al 2015 consequently strain is produced and bending occurs as shown in fig 22 b and c these actuators can be manipulated to generate the desired stress by controlling the amount and which channels the fluid goes through marchese et al 2015 marchese et al 2014 soft robotic fish where the peduncle is composed entirely of fluidic elastomer actuators feas have been developed one design has a hydraulic pump that includes a gas regulation mechanism and a delivery system to control the fluid pressure onal et al 2011 the fea fish by marchese et al marchese et al 2014 can reach a maximum bending angle of 100 using the anterior and posterior agonistic and antagonistic body actuators katzschmann et al katzschmann et al 2016 katzschmann et al 2018 developed a very capable system that performed an endurance mission in a real world mission in an oceanic environment the vorticity control unmanned undersea vehicle vcuuv is a solid multi link actuated robot and was inspired by the robotuna made by massachusetts institute and technology researchers the vcuuv s hydraulic actuator has multiple tubes connected to each link in the chain to create a powerful motion this robot is a unique design where no other system found was this large or used rigid links actuated by hydraulic pressure anderson and chhabra 2002 5 3 biohybrid actuators the biohybrid actuator refers to an integration of muscular tissue and artificial structures capable of imitating the performance of living structures with regards to stiffness and contraction phases ricotti and fujie 2017 park et al 2016 ricotti and menciassi 2012 this type of actuator would allow for greater adaptation flexibility and power to soft robots ricotti and fujie 2017 in addition they can operate at high efficiency and harvest energy from the nutrients available from their surroundings park et al 2016 biohybrid actuators can show a higher efficiency over the standard artificial actuators because muscle has a high power to weight ratio ricotti and fujie 2017 these actuators are constructed by applying a nano scale thickness of membrane improves muscle contractions for these actuators because muscle bundles must be small layers to this point ricotti and fujie 2017 park et al park et al 2016 designed and fabricated a robotic stingray utilizing photonic excited biohybrid actuator which had reproducible fin undulation motion capable turning scenarios as depicted in fig 23 a this system creates coordinated undulating fin motion and phototactically controlled motion using a sensory motor system park et al 2016 the composition of the biohybrid system includes a 3d elastomer body a gold skeleton an interstitial elastomer coating and a layer of cardiomyocytes in a body that was smaller than a penny park et al 2016 the thin gold skeleton stores elastic energy during the stroke and rebounds during the relaxation phase which reduced the complexity of the design park et al 2016 nawroth et al nawroth et al 2012 worked on the fabrication of a tissue engineered jellyfish inspired by the aurelia aurita as presented in fig 23 b the motion of the system was derived by applying electrical impulses to the bell thus giving a synchronized movement nawroth et al 2012 the composition of the medusoid is based on a combination of anisotropic cardiomyocytes and an elastic silicone nawroth et al 2012 the sheet of muscle tissue contracted the bell and an elastomer returns to original shape nawroth et al 2012 due to the lack of controlling the muscle contraction the robotic jellyfish could not achieve the turning and maneuvering tasks nawroth et al 2012 6 materials material selection is broad and is dependent on the type of actuator selected as stated these materials are separated into two categories rigid and soft these groups organized the important material properties elasticity stiffness yield ultimate tensile strength ductility hardness toughness fatigue strength endurance limit and creep resistance these properties must be considered when designing systems based on their actuator 6 1 rigid materials found rigid components are grouped together based on their higher stiffness these materials do not exhibit high elastic deformation selection is based off cost of design motion of actuation machining capabilities to produce the desired shape and specified biological characteristics to replicate to machine complex parts computer aided manufacturing cam machine tools are utilized because low tolerance of materials is needed generally rigid materials are used for larger components that can handle a higher amount of stress and the desired elastic deformation to be extremely low these materials are grouped in table 5 some of these rigid materials can exhibit flexibility depending on structure where they will be used like fin ribs that are desired to have some complacence 6 2 soft materials soft materials include materials that can express large elastic deformations and can return to original shape deformation can either happen passively or through impulse to the material like electricity the utility of these materials is that they can bend with the desired motion rubber materials like silicone can be used to waterproof and protect actuators elastomers can be used to encase moving components like fins and behave similarly to biological animals the soft material actuators are grouped in table 6 to show material characteristics general soft materials are grouped in table 7 7 sensors sensors play an important role in giving systems sense of their environment orientation and offer utility like animals auvs need to be able to recognize and adapt to their surroundings maintain control and take sample data obstacle recognition position depth pressure stability acceleration inertia force torque system electrical current usage system water leakage water temperature and ph sensors are used by bioinspired and non bioinspired systems decreasing the size of these sensors allows for systems to use more than one giving the systems a broader range of capabilities smaller components fit in the limited body cavity space there is a wide range of components available for selection to make these systems autonomous the sensors used are found in table 8 obstacle recognition sensors include infrared camera sonar and electrolocation infrared and cameras use light waves to capture underwater bodies sonar is the sensing of reflected sound pings emitted from the body kanhere 2017 electrolocation is the recognition of obstacles due to their alteration of the electronic field kanhere 2017 the most commonly used obstacle detection sensor is the infrared sensor the lateral line is a sensitive array of sensory organs along the side body of biological animals is used for obstacle awareness from fluid movement kanhere 2017 lateral line sensor designed by kottapalli et al kottapalli and asadnia 2017 describes a variety of hair cell sensors that can detect fluid flow with high sensitivity a pressure sensor array was considered by nelson et al nelson and mohseni 2017 and wang et al wang et al 2017a to try to mimic the lateral line but have yet to implement this array in a bioinspired auv gps keeps the system swimming between objectives stability acceleration inertia force and torque sensors keep the system stable verify forces exhibited by the structure and resulting stresses and torques in the structure electrical and water leakage sensors monitor the electrical components to make sure battery life is optimized and the system does not short circuit pressure and depth sensors are used to keep systems out of failure depths and swimming at the correct depth data collection sensors are not needed for autonomy but rather for aquatic surveying options sensors included in this group are temperature and ph sensors these give the capability to test the water column and give useful data points difficult to obtain over large volumes 8 batteries the different types of batteries used are mainly lithium polymer lithium ion and nickel metal hydride these are rechargeable batteries that each has its own respective composition to separate and store charge the ni mh batteries are a cheaper option but do not have long life in comparison with the li ion and li polymer buchmann 2017 ni mh do not have harmful metal compounds so pollution potential is null which is not the case for li ion or li polymer buchmann 2017 li polymer can be made into many sizes extremely thin or large but are generally lightweight buchmann 2017 li ion has potential to be the most powerful but is the most expensive of the three exhibited as it is still not manufactured in large scale buchmann 2017 the used batteries for auvs applications are depicted in table 9 9 critical discussion constraints limitations and future recommendations all the previous sections show critical background necessary prior to discussing trends and offering our observational comments and future recommendations a conceived design cycle for auvs is shown in fig 24 this figure is the overview for necessary steps needed to create bioinspired or more preferably biomimetic auvs the control units that should be considered in the electronics selection have not been investigated because they require an in depth investigation to push the boundaries of autonomy there are multiple aspects of bioinspiration that lead to more biomimetic designs primarily the selection of the locomotion type and respective animals should have the largest influence in the design generally a design should account for every constraint from the biological animal including sizing kinematics physics and hydrodynamics sizing is not included in this paper as this requires an understanding of multiple case representations for each biological locomotion as mentioned in salazar et al 2018a this review gives examples of how the kinematics are derived obtaining some physical phenomena of the system and hydrodynamic analyses all these methods attempt to model the intended system to gain a more fundamental understanding to create a functioning auv the actuator selection is dependent on the modeling of the system and the materials desired to replicate the motion and structures of the inspirational animal the electronics help auvs be more autonomous and react to their surroundings control systems for actuators are not consolidated in this review as they require a separate in depth review indeed control strategies are different for rigid and soft actuators and should be considered post actuator selection design recommendations will be made to help lead future investigators to build capable swimming designs 9 1 swimming style first the desired swimming style must be selected the main categories are fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion as shown in fig 25 fin oscillation and fin undulation categories utilize similar fins tail pectoral dorsal and anal however fin oscillation species that solely utilize the body caudal fin bcf exhibit the fastest speeds jet propulsion are characterized for animals that force water out of a constricting volume 9 2 kinematic modeling the kinematics includes determining the body shape and size of the animal and representing the motion of these structures caudal fin animals require an understanding of the mechanics of the bcf spinal flexion including head and tail displacement pectoral dorsal and anal fins necessitate an understanding of the fin edge leading trailing displacement relative to the fin root and how the fin span reacts to the torsion caused by the edge displacement what has not been implemented into design or study is a combination of pectoral dorsal anal and caudal fins for the ostraciiform li et al 2016 however fin kinematics are much more complex than the bcf in fact many used models did not include the torsion and large deformation for fin flexibility work by blevins et al blevins and lauder 2012 attempts to include these three dimensional effects of the rajiform fin beam and plate theories can also be modified to attempt to explain these flexible fins the animals in fin oscillation and fin undulation classes have more rigid fin ribs in the membrane these composite fins increase the fin stiffness and create great propulsive and control surfaces one thing to note for all these animals is that the body composition and structure determine the rigidity of the body and fins bony fish usually have vertebrae and fin ribs as shown in table 10 the more vertebrae that the spinal column is segmented into the more flexible and undulatory the body can be alternatively the spine can become more rigid with less joints and transfer powerful concentrated fin strokes fin rib rigidity depends on the size and density of the rib tail fins tend to have a large number of fins that create semi rigid structures if fin ribs have multiple segments the structure is for sure more flexible cartilaginous animals can have individual or interconnected fin rib structures to either give isolated control or structural support the fin structure of the bony fish are individual fin structures that besides for the caudal fin are attached to the spine for the ghost knife fish the rib structures of the undulatory fin are segmented and varying in thickness and density the gymnotiform s last rib is what these animals use to control the fin membrane the animals in the jet propulsion category lack rigid structures and express large body deformation the kinematic modeling needs to adapt to include the flexibility of fins and bodies for these animals animals in all the categories exhibit some form of body flexibility the variation of body flexibility depends on the animal shape musculature and skeletal structure fins have varying flexibility depending on the composition of excitation structures fin oscillation animals have more rigid fin ribs in the membrane while fin undulation animals rib structures are much more flexible the jet propulsion animal s bodies are largely independent of any rigid structures so their bodies are the most flexible out of the three categories 9 3 physical modeling the physical modeling gives the reynolds number and strouhal number if frequency of oscillation length of animal the amplitude of oscillation fluid viscosity and fluid speed are known parameters however obtaining the thrust and drag for these systems is more complicated the pressure and shear stress distribution of the fluid over the body need to be known to obtain these terms this poses a difficult engineering problem if the exact solution is desired because it requires a complex understanding of the fluid regime this is done through the hydrodynamic analysis assumed generalities about the thrust and drag can be made to obtain the coefficients of thrust and drag assumptions about the shape of interest can yield a simplified result for the thrust and drag 9 4 hydrodynamic analyses there are two methods used to understand the fluid mechanics of the system namely experimental and numerical experimental methods study the biological animals and auv swimming utilizing piv these cameras are capable of tracking velocity of particles this is extremely useful as it offers a solution for the pressure and shear stress for the fluid regime the quality of the piv analysis is dependent on the equipment used the more expensive units are capable of more detailed sensing ultimately these high speed sensory cameras give flow characteristics to determine the forces on the body which is done by integrating the pressure and wall shear over the shape this technique also helps to study material response of the auv during swimming like similar fin and body morphology to the biological these methods do not only help to determine constraints of design but also work as a validating step for future work the numerical methods are much more tedious in comparison with experimental analysis these methods use software to complete complex computations where generalities or assumptions are made to obtain a solution creating moving structures that are precise replicas of biological structures is difficult in simulations analysis using a rigid body are common for motions like the bcf movement an assumption of body shape to a symmetric shape airfoil is also common there are cases of computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis for almost all kinds of fish locomotion but inclusion of body motion with fin motion is rare the numerical methods are tedious requiring a good understanding of the structural shape of the animal the locomotion kinematics and one must have a firm understanding of fluid dynamics 9 5 actuator selection creating a perfectly capable auv is still years away but major advances are being made with actuator development actuator selection is difficult because of the complex architecture and motions of the biological animals which actuators need to replicate this review has described the known actuators that have been or could be included in auvs to give an expansive representation of the possibilities to be used in design the actuators have been organized into rigid and soft categories 9 5 1 rigid actuators rigid actuators have better thrust capabilities as motors provide powerful mechanical input where the body structure is made stronger with rigid links bcf rigid link actuators try to replicate the spinal flexion but they lack the multi dimensional spinal flexibility that the animals have inclusion of planar joints to the main link chain attempts to replicate this phenomenon but still lacks this flexibility including another plane of motion to create flexibility rigid rib actuators have been shown that they can cause wave propagations in a flexible fin membrane tests utilizing more flexible ribs caused higher thrust than the stiffer ribs paddle fin actuators have been proven useful in propulsive and maneuvering control propulsive paddle fins utilize either flapping or rowing motion there have not been designs that try and utilize both paddle fins used for maneuvering control exhibit the best capabilities when they are capable of more degrees of freedom to control roll and pitch in table 11 the advantages and disadvantages of rigid actuators are summarized 9 5 1 1 link actuators single link is the most simplistic design as there is only one joint that exhibits rotation and requires a single oscillating servomotor this type of actuator has been used in thunniform and ostraciiform designs as these require a more isolated peduncle oscillation to the caudal fin the issue with these systems is that they lack directional control because the peduncle only has one planar direction of motion these designs have utilized rigid plastics for the component construction the multiple link actuators are much more diverse than the single link the inclusion of the more joints makes the peduncle more flexible similar to the biological phenomena this allows the rigid links to match up with the motion model for the backbone of the caudal fin fishes these links are composed of materials like metals or rigid plastics the anguilliform auvs include many more joints than the carangiform designs where carangiforms generally have less than five joints this limitation for the carangiform is from the links being restricted to the peduncle section anguilliform designs which include more than ten small links like that of stefanini et al stefanini et al 2012 creates an extremely flexible body carangiform designs like the isplash incorporate links that are over the whole body that give a more realistic whole body flexion as it creates a head oscillation clapham and hu 2014 an issue with including more joints is that the control for the motion becomes more difficult studying control methods requires a more exclusive study the robotic dolphin design by yu et al yu et al 2016b utilized a flexible head joint to mimic head oscillations of a biological dolphin the inclusion of a head joint in combination with powerful dc motors allowed this design to achieve a fast enough speed to propel the auv out of the water a robotic dolphin by yu et al yu and wei 2013 included a lateral joint at the base of the peduncle giving a different flexion of the peduncle for turning researchers are trying to integrate these link systems into traditional propeller based systems to enhance endurance and performance like that in scaradozzi et al scaradozzi et al 2017b 9 5 1 2 rib actuators the connected rib actuators utilize a connected crank system requiring only one mechanical input for this system the utility of this design is that the control of the wave propagation is based on how the crank design transmits the mechanical energy down the chain each rib moves in a perpendicular plane to the body and oscillates in a singular plane the issues with this design are that you cannot alter the wave amplitudes along the fin the motion is fixed to the designed requirements only frequency of oscillation can be altered by increasing the input signal for the crank chain this actuator type does not give the independent rib excitation like the biological animals the individual rib actuators have an input motor on each rib that is connected to the body the servomotors require a control signal to initiate and advance the wave propagation like the connected rib actuators the servomotors cause the rib to rise and plunge in a single plane the utility of this actuator type is the ability to control the amplitude of each rib and the direction of the wave propagation a majority of the auvs found utilize the individual rib actuators the difficulty of these systems is that controlling the servomotors in sequential order with the correct amplitude to give the best efficiency requires a deeper understanding of the response of the system curet et al curet et al 2011 created a capable undulatory fin but the body of these designs are rigid the assemblies of these auvs lack the spinal rigidity which the inspirational biological animals have the single rib passive fins require less motors than the individual rib the single rib rises and plunges in oscillation like the two other actuators in this class then a travelling wave is transmitted passively across the attached membrane this actuator type is simple and has already been integrated into a working rajiform auv design by niu et al niu et al 2012 with future development this actuator could be a good choice as it is simple requires less motors but has still proven to be a capable auv 9 5 1 3 paddle fin the rigid paddle fin actuators have utility for both propulsion and maneuvering control propulsive caudal fin designs are usually only planar oscillation similar to the single link design however the joint is right at the fin base these actuators only cause actuation to the fin but because of the aqueous environment the body experiences a torque causing issues with directional control these single caudal fin actuators tend to cause yaw instability to the auv a method to counteract this is to use two caudal paddle fins like the design by zhang et al zhang et al 2016 propulsive pectoral fins are inspired by the labriform and ostraciiform rowing and flapping motion utilizing planar oscillator paddle fin actuators that have a single degree of freedom for rowing makes them inefficient designs such as behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 overcome this high drag by making a flexible feathering joint to replicate the rowing motion of the labriform the paddle fins can also be used as maneuvering control surfaces either a one two or three degree of freedom fin can be created allowing these auvs to adjust pitch roll and yaw shen et al 2011 designs that do use the higher degree of freedom do tend to be larger as more actuators or complex mechanism must be integrated around the fin joint these fins can act as wings and have even been used for gliding to conserve energy during swimming this can be seen in work done by wu et al wu et al 2015 9 5 2 soft actuators soft robotics can be explained by systems that predominately use elastic materials for sure there is an amount variation of soft materials used in these auvs where some components might be solid based however the actuators themselves are considered flexible capable of deformations to achieve locomotion actuators capable of this are sma ipmc piezoelectric cable driven hydraulic and biohybrid smp can bend but have not been implemented into auv design de are capable of expansion but are inefficient for auvs sma are the most powerful smart materials sma wires are integrated into a flexible material and is heavily dependent on location of attachment as off neutral axis of attachment causes the bending using a spring steel for the bismac actuator creates a better bending and return as it can be used for attachment guides ipmc are more capable at making large deformations but are not as powerful as sma piezoelectric is one of the smart materials that offers a solution for oscillatory bending cable driven actuators depend on the contraction of the wires and has been shown that it can be implemented into fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion designs the utilization of powerful servomotors with flexible wires and more mimetic body shapes makes these designs a good representation of realizing more mimetic designs hydraulic actuators show promise in bcf designs as the completely elastomer peduncle can perform the high flexural oscillatory bending in table 12 advantages and disadvantages of soft actuators are consolidated 9 5 2 1 shape memory alloys as it was mentioned before smas raised a lot of interest in the soft robotics field because of their extremely high power to weight ratio and shape memory effect however the strain of sma is low and exhibit fatigue failure on the order of 2 107 cycles zhang and sun 2017 among the alloys available for these actuators the niti alloys are the best option since they present the best memory and super elasticity they can be deformed by using low voltages and have a high resistance to chemical corrosion these actuators exhibit a control issue that come from the hysteresis of the shape memory effect and cooling smas show less strain and a lower efficiency than the ipmc and piezoelectric different kinds of bending motion can be achieved by smas depending on the structure and layout of the sma the movement produced by worms is a common type of motion among auvs fabricated with these actuators this is because the longitudinal and circumferential radial sma wires alternate to cause peristaltic movement using circumferential sma wires makes the robotic system contract its diameter and longitudinal wires shorten the length of the body the low strain of the sma was altered by using a spring steel as a mounting substrate where the sma has an off axial loading on the spring steel to cause larger bending this combination is outlined as the bismac actuators and was used in jellyfish auvs and can present a good planform for future designs following villanueva et al villanueva et al 2013 it is recommended that this smart material sees improvements in hysteresis control and longer lifespan before reliable long swimming missions can be carried out using this actuator 9 5 2 2 cable driven unlike other actuators used in soft robotics cable driven requires a servomotor or pneumatic pressure to produce the pulling of cables thus causing motion these inputs are more constant and reliable than a majority of the smart actuators like sma actuators cables shorten to cause off axial bending or pull on a membrane this is the only actuator that has exhibited motion capability in all three classes fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion the difficulty with these systems is that the motion is a direct correlation of the actuation assembly the desired motion replication can see great improvements with this class with future development a peduncle with flexible links and a compliant caudal fin was created by zhong et al zhong et al 2017 and is capable of performing the spatio temporal function given in eq 1 with great similarity this is one of the best soft designs capable of fin oscillation a flexible leading edge fin rib with a passive undulating fin was created by cai et al cai et al 2009 this design used pneumatic stimulus to pull on a rope that ran over the top of the flexible fin rib however this system could perform only an upstroke motion investigation should be done to create a downstroke for this design as then it would be more mimetic a mantel compression bladder was constructed by giorgio serchi et al giorgio serchi et al 2013 in this design direct fixture points in the silicone mantel are pulled to a central servomotor causing a decrease in volume in the future this actuator type shows great promise to be developed and matured into reliable swimming auvs 9 5 2 3 shape memory polymer and dielectric elastomer the smart material actuators in this section need further work to become efficient in their implementation on the soft robotics field the smps do not use direct current rather they use chemicals or magnetic fields as stimuli instead these alternative stimuli are more difficult to implement into an autonomous auv design although it demonstrates good capabilities as an actuator there is no previous work of them being used to fabricate auvs de shows a higher response time and a higher strain than ipmcs but they require a higher voltage to operate the large amount of strain is produced due to the compliance of the electrodes with the elastomer there may be a utility in the future for de as bioinspired systems due to their resemblance to animal muscles based on density elasticity pressure efficiency and speed but currently they lack the performance needed 9 5 2 4 ionic polymer metallic composites ipmc actuators are a smart material and have been implemented into robotic systems for their bending and twisting deformation capabilities to achieve their bending deformations these actuators use applications of either dc voltage thermal treatment light chemicals or magnetic fields stimulus through dc voltage to the actuator is the most applicable in auvs as it is a low voltage input if the ipmc beam is a free cantilever then the curvature for each cycle of load is not exact as heat stored by the material plays a role in the curvature and return to unbent shape if the beam is to large then curling of the ipmc can occur theoretically alternating the polarity on the actuator should cause bending in both directions but due to the thermal capacitance the flexion will not be symmetric yeom and hu yeom and oh 2009 found that a heat treatment for these actuators could be beneficial to achieve a better flexion the ipmc jellyfish have difficulties with flexion response during activation and relaxation phase with improvements to this smart material it could have many more applications in the three classes if the response time between flexion cycles can be reduced 9 5 2 5 piezoelectric materials piezoelectric material actuators are stimulated by low voltage inputs and are constructed in beam designs like the design of cen and erturk cen and erturk 2013 this actuator offers a moderate power to weight ratio that can perform oscillatory bending vibration the deformations of these actuators are not large but the work time is dependent on how long power is supplied piezoelectric actuators are not as incombered by the heat transfer problem as the ipmc so bending cycles can be induced much more regularly and for longer periods depending on power supply this type of actuator is not often utilized in auv design but has possibilities for fluttering fins in the future caudal fin designs should incorporate a flexible peduncle shell over the piezoelectric material to help improve bioinspiration 9 5 2 6 hydraulic pressure robotic systems using fluid actuation show promising capabilities such as high flexibility power and quick response time using hydraulic actuators is much more complex since onboard systems are required that will help control them such systems will help supply power to the rest of the systems deliver the fluid throughout the channels control the fluid s pressure and control the robot with a communication and control system all powered systems are stored in a rigid region of the robotic system the need of all these systems makes soft robots be less efficient than rigid bodied robots katzschmann et al katzschmann et al 2016 katzschmann et al 2018 recently tested their auv in a real world oceanic mission for a remote controlled carangiform auv this design had depth control and showed capable forward swimming motion the next step for this design is to make the system completely autonomous clever design could yield auvs in the fin undulation and jet propulsion and be an actuator of choice alongside the cable driven however the complex design of the fluidic chambers and their expansion to pressure presents a difficult challenge to overcome 9 5 2 7 biohybrid biohybrid actuators have shown greater efficiency as they are true biological muscle and they are the closest approach to mimic biological system however since these systems are new they are still highly experimental some biohybrid systems lack certain capabilities as turning and maneuvering the application of ultra thin membranes nano scale thickness is utilized because it allows for a higher deformation from the muscle contraction if functioning muscle could be engineered and implemented as a larger actuator it could change how we look at biorobotics the biohybrid actuators are the most capable of achieving biomimicry as real muscle is integrated into a polymer based design the difficulty for these designs are that they are still in small scale large muscle packaging has not been achieved but with further advances in biomechanics the possible applications for these actuators could be endless advancements in muscular construction for the biohybrid can result in larger designs that are more powerful 9 6 materials the material selection when building an auv depends greatly on the locomotion and design trying to be achieved combination of the materials gives improvements of flexibility for more rigid systems and give soft systems better translated power however rigid actuators require a large majority of components to be inflexible giving the assembly structure strength the rigid actuators are moving to be more flexible by including flexible joints more links and flexible ribs peduncle units for multi link designs are often crafted out of aluminum or rigid plastic due to their cheapness and machinability how soft actuators can improve sma need to perform higher cycles before failure ipmc requires improvement in power sma and ipmc need to determine the best heat transfer dissipation techniques and piezoelectric material need to be able to perform larger deformations to produce better thrust it was found that cable driven actuators show the best combination crossover between the rigid and soft categories hydraulic actuators combine the rigid material protection for the electronic compartment and flexible peduncle to create a capable system auvs that utilized propulsive fins had better performance when the fin had some complacency like biological animals the electronics compartment for auvs tend to be rigid encasements that is water tight and made from a plastic body shells made of flexible material have become more common as this gives a more mimetic shape ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 shen et al 2011 these shells can be made from soft or rigid materials that are selected depending on body morphology and shape that is trying to be achieved so the motion is not impeded yu et al 2016b soft actuators use elastomers for body coverage because structures need to deform for multiple cycles with low internal resistance maintain water proofing and maintain overall shape material selection in the future should consider replication of designs for machining and assembly purposes to lower cost and increase number of units produced in the future an investigation into the material lifespan of the new combination systems should be conducted 9 7 electronics electronic selection is a topic all on its own this review attempts to consolidate and give examples of motors sensors and batteries another key electrical component would be the control panels that monitor system performance perform onboard calculations and output signals depending on programming and construction control panels are the device that ties all the other electronics together as they effectively are the brain of the auv however control panels are not included in this review as they require an in depth investigation to help others optimize their robotic systems in the future the motors that are used to give mechanical power to rigid or soft actuators are completely dependent on the auvs needs the average auv is small less than 2 m so these motors tend to not be large however the large auvs like yu et al yu et al 2016b and anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 require a much more powerful dc motor it is possible to find waterproof actuators which can be submersed the best recommendations that can be given at this time is that sensors should be equipped to give the auv spatial awareness stability awareness internal system monitoring and environmental sampling capabilities these sensors help the auv to see obstacles infrared cameras sonar electrolocation monitor heading depth stability gps inclinometer attitude transducer pressure sensor gyroscope acceleration inertia accelerometer inertial measurement unit force torque strain gauge stress sensor electrical current water leakage voltmeter moisture sensor temperature chemical thermometer ph sensor these sensors give the auv diagnostics about spatial positioning and to take water samples while it swims this review displays the wide selection of sensors and cameras that can be applied for an array of inputs to help the auv navigate their environment these sensors and cameras have been developed into smaller scales and require less power at the moment auvs struggle to perform missions for extended periods of time murphy and haroutunian 2011 in the future the motion of these auvs could be used to power these smaller cameras and sensors by extracting the vibrational motion using energy harvesting techniques salazar et al 2018b the batteries give these electronics and the actuators their power but lifespan of these batteries is heavily dependent on usage selection of the appropriate battery to maximize swimming capability should be a priority all the electronics used require a battery that will maintain charge for long periods of time and is rechargeable that is why ni mh li ion and li polymer have been used each has advantages and disadvantages and is dependent on the users needs and budget the most customizable battery in terms of shape is the li polymer which could be applicable when compact design is required 10 conclusions auvs are continuing to be optimized to develop an autonomous vehicle so they can be used in real world applications in efforts to create more optimized auvs the kinematic physical and hydrodynamic modeling were outlined which lead to the actuator design the electronics were outlined to show the possibilities for utility and autonomy the modeling of the biological animals gave a more fundamental understanding of the capabilities and characteristics that gave criteria for the motion and size majority of this work expressed the rigid and soft actuators in their respective categories and gave representations of auvs utilizing these types of actuators the described auvs served as a good literature reviews for each category the more intriguing found auvs were the ones that include more flexibility for the fin or body actuators the combination of rigid and soft materials was proposed as biological animals have rigid and soft structures the selection of materials was assumed to be a top priority to create biomimetic auvs acknowledgments the authors a campos and v fuentes gratefully

23034,aquatic robotics is making a critical transition to adapt and inspire more efficient systems from nature the result is the abandonment of inefficient propeller based locomotion for a biological locomotion type suitable for the specific mission bioinspired aquatic unmanned vehicles auvs could be exploited in a diverse range of missions depending on the design and its capabilities removing the human pilot and creating an animal based auv means that more hazardous aquatic environments can be studied with reduced repercussions there is a diverse range of biological locomotion s to choose from when developing a bioinspired auv the respective animals that exhibit a specific swimming mode give a range of criteria to follow make the system more capable of swimming in this review how previous auv developers determined the kinematic physical and hydrodynamic modeling of these systems are consolidated and discussed all types of developed actuators are reviewed organized and explained based on their materials and motion capabilities the electronic components of these systems are outlined to give an idea of how these bioinspired auvs are constructed then it is discussed what makes these systems bioinspired and biomimetic and the trends of these designs limitations and future recommendations on possible improvements for these systems are offered and deeply discussed 1 introduction robotic systems are being adapted to perform complex missions in aqueous environments blindberg 2001 colgate and lynch 2004 habib 2013 wettergreen et al 1998 raj and thakur 2016 murphy and haroutunian 2011 aquatic unmanned vehicles auvs alternatively referred to as unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs are receiving growing interest because of their potential to replace current aquatic tethered systems colgate and lynch 2004 murphy and haroutunian 2011 currently aquatic robots are inefficient at moving because of their shape use of propellers for thrust and tethered control blindberg 2001 murphy and haroutunian 2011 interest into the adaptation of biological motion creates robots which are capable at swimming like fish these robots can perform routine swimming missions that would be considered hostile for hominid and outdated robotic investigations raj and thakur 2016 scaradozzi et al 2017a yen and azwadi 2015 cruz et al 1999 clarification into the development of previous auvs is needed to gain a better understanding so more optimized unmanned systems can be designed in the future auvs can be applied in a range of missions for both civilian and military purposes missions include environmental surveying oil spill monitoring internal pipe inspection erosion monitoring observation of animal species beach safety espionage anti espionage and border patrol blindberg 2001 najem et al 2012 tan 2011 lin et al 2013 diazdelcastillo et al 2017 lin et al 2016 each mission requires a specific capability which means designs must adapt to meet the increasing range of possible missions murphy and haroutunian 2011 with the potential for swarming based missions auvs could be exploited in collaborative missions that cover more space locations munasinghe et al 2017 currently aquatic systems consider a rigid boxlike or torpedo structure equipped with propellers and are controlled through use of a tether blindberg 2001 however these systems have difficulty maneuvering in close quarter environments and are inefficient in comparison with fish habib 2013 murphy and haroutunian 2011 the tether is cumbersome and makes it hard to maneuver as it has potential for getting snagged on obstacles which can result in the failure of the mission this causes the need for more natural and free moving systems that can complete a complex mission some systems have been equipped with non propeller based thrust a positive step forward guizzo 2008 rico et al 2017 the new auvs have been designed using actuation mechanism materials sensors and batteries that condone bioinsipiration and biomimicry to express differences between animals and auvs work done by murphy et al murphy and haroutunian 2011 explains the capabilities of biological and mechanical systems through a comparative investigation of variables like speed depth turning capabilities endurance and cost of transport in fig 1 a and b examples of the differences between auvs and biological animals are presented animals express better turning endurance and speed than robotic systems in fig 1 b circle size is a cost of transport function taking into account the energy expended to swim per body mass the larger biological animals require less energy to swim and have much higher endurance studies have been conducted where the focus has been placed on analyses and validations of auvs that are capable of autonomous swimming colgate and lynch 2004 raj and thakur 2016 yen and azwadi 2015 cen and erturk 2013 neveln et al 2013 webb and weihs 2015 shen et al 2015 these investigations offer insight into the methods performed to create the most optimal systems the sections that are determined to be the most important and are considered in this review are as follows 2 biological terminology 3 kinematic and dynamic modeling 4 hydrodynamic analyses 5 actuators 6 materials 7 sensors 8 batteries 9 discussion and future recommendations and 10 conclusions this review consolidates and organizes these topics in a manner that will allow for more optimized auvs to be created understanding the following topics in detail allows for the optimal methods to be discussed and used in the future 2 biological terminology this review describes these categories of locomotion which pertain to fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion species as shown in fig 2 if more knowledge is required on this categorization and respective biological and robotic systems the readers are referred to a recent review work by salazar et al salazar et al 2018a the key terms that need to be recognized for the biological animals are the body characteristics and structures needed for thrust and control by the respective the physical characteristics are considered important for auv adaptation and optimization the physical terminology that is defined for all animals is shown in fig 3 the forces expressed by the system are depicted in fig 3 a while fig 3 b and c represent the three directions the body can move during swimming caudal fin animals utilize an oscillating body flexion to actuate the tail which is known as body caudal fin bcf locomotion scaradozzi et al 2017a sfakiotakis et al 1999 lauder 2015 zhou et al 2017 utilization of a caudal fin allows species to achieve fast speed sfakiotakis et al 1999 the animals in this class generally bony and have a spinal structure to support the body fin undulation species excite individual rib structures in the fin to cause undulations along the fin length certain species in the rajiform gymnotiform and balistiform category are capable of forward and reverse swimming directions depending on the wave direction this class is a mixture of bony and cartilaginous animals body structures vary greatly depending on the species selected jet propulsion animals contract their bodies to forcibly expel water from an internal cavity the body of these animals lack rigid structure so complex musculature gives the body motion and support there are many combinations between these three main categories each with their own unique method of locomotion 3 kinematic and dynamic modeling to create models for the characteristics of biological systems various methods are used it can be found that there are a multitude of swimming styles expressed by aquatic animals this includes but is not limited to animals that use caudal fins pectoral fins dorsal or anal fins these fins can either perform oscillatory or undulatory motions to produce thrust for jet propulsion animals compress water by clenching a mantel or bell these different swimming styles require specific motions to generate the required thrust for the auvs these models give the required motion for surfaces so thrust can be optimized 3 1 kinematic modeling kinematic modeling is obtained through the observation of living specimens these living specimens give the motion and velocity characteristics for the body moreover this methodology helps to obtain shape of propulsion surfaces and body distinct criteria of the individual species can then be replicated when designing an actuation mechanism methods for biological observation include body and fin marker tracking using cameras in a controlled environment like a water channel or static fluid tank 3 1 1 fin oscillation kinematic modeling spinal flexion modeling is considered for animals that utilize a caudal fin shown in fig 4 mpf motion has been tracked for fishes in the labriform and ostraciiform subcategories where models for these cases are based on the fin edge shown in fig 5 biological motion is created for species through the complex retraction and relaxation of the muscles along body fig 4 b is a representation of one complete cycle for a carangiform fish it can be noted that muscle activation initiates behind the head to the tail peduncle the more flexible anguilliform species express more alterations between the lengthening and shorting of their lateral muscles expressing more than one wave period gillis 1996 videler et al 2001 mpf fishes do not require the large lateral muscle activation as these fins have more localized muscle around the fin westneat 1996 fig 6 is a marker spinal curvature model which gives one phase in propulsive cycle by determining the motion of the spine the most basic motion can be extracted for each type of caudal fin motion for anguilliform the spinal curvature is more complex as the body performs larger wave amplitudes and also have multiple periods over the body length the subcarangiform and carangiform have similar body undulation but the subcarangiform has greater head amplitude to initiate the body undulation sfakiotakis et al 1999 thunniform fishes have the smallest head amplitudes while the body undulation is restricted to the peduncle these types of oscillations are modeled using a combination of different sinusoidal curves with varying amplitudes colgate and lynch 2004 scaradozzi et al 2017a yu et al 2016a cui et al 2017 clapham and hu 2014 liu et al 2005 bergmann and lollo 2011 khalid et al 2016 these models are usually constructed using a quadratic polynomial function as an envelope for a sinusoidal wave as shown in eq 1 1 y x t a 0 a 1 x a 2 x 2 sin Ï t k x the polynomial function expresses the amplitude envelope of the lateral motion of the spine as a function of space the wave number k of the body undulations that corresponds to the wave length and angular frequency are considered in the sinusoidal term borazjani and sotiropoulos 2010 the terms a 0 a 1 and a 2 are coefficients of the amplitude envelope the tracking for mpf swimmers requires an understanding of the fin motion due to fin rotation during power and recovery stroke multiple markers are used to track both the leading and trailing edges respectively as shown in fig 5 a labriforms are capable of different types of propulsive fin stroke performing flapping or rowing motions as presented in fig 5 b d shown for the flapping motion the power stroke occurs on the downstroke while the power stroke for the rowing motion occurs when the fin is pulled back recovery during the rowing motion is much more drastic as the fin transitions to a flat position to the fluid flow to minimize drag flapping is carried out by the leading edge plunging the greatest distance in the y direction compared to the trailing edge as shown in fig 5 b and c walker and westneat 1997 walker and westneat 2002 the angle of the flapping stroke is along vertical axis perpendicular to the body where the rowing stroke is more of a lateral plane to the body walker and westneat 2002 shown in fig 5 e the fin tip displacement for the rowing motion can occur at a certain angle of attack depending on the swimming speed and control the animal desires these motions are more difficult to model as swimming gait transitions for different speeds numerical methods like those considered by shoele et al shoele and zhu 2010 have shown that it is possible to model some of the swimming motions of a labriform flapping is mostly used for slower speed swimming while a rowing motion is used for higher speeds walker and westneat 2002 sitorus et al 2009 however once the muscles for pectoral locomotion are exhausted these animals can utilize a bcf locomotion to maintain speed davison 1988 there are a few auvs that consider the caudal fin in the labriform design higher emphasis is put on the pectoral motion ostraciiforms use the pectoral dorsal anal and sometimes the caudal fin depending on the species the pectoral fins and single dorsal and anal fin are primarily used at lower speeds while the caudal fin can be used at higher speeds wang et al 2013 same as the labriform the higher the speed the more lateral the flapping motion hove et al 2001 wang et al 2014 the dorsal and anal fins should be synonymous with a flapping motion as the leading edge of the fin performs the greatest plunging amplitude the dorsal and anal fins are used for increased stability as they correct yaw and roll for these fishes 3 1 2 fin undulation kinematic modeling animals in this class use a flexible fin membrane as propulsive surfaces the support structures of these fins are often ribs whose flexibility depends on the species traveling undulatory waves of these fins need to be studied as they create thrust to move the body forward and stabilize the animal while it swims wave amplitude and frequency are unique for each species considering the fin undulation category sfakiotakis et al sfakiotakis et al 1999 described the translational wave that these animals initiate causes perpendicular and parallel force to the fin base these forces are what give these animals their unique stability and maneuvering capabilities lauder 2015 the rajiform category contains animals like the cownose ray and manta ray shown in fig 7 a the leading fin edge performs a greater plunging amplitude relative to the trailing edge while the surface of the fin can exhibit a traveling wave where the fin motion appears as oscillatory but the flexibility of the fin over its span makes it undulatory the flapping motion of the manta ray is similar to the labriform flapping motion but the larger cartilaginous pectoral fin is for sure more flexible videography helped to discretize the specific flapping motion for a cownose ray as shown in fig 7 b and c zheng et al 2010 the stingray also a rajiform exhibits a different undulation wave compared to the cownose ray as it uses isolated wave propagations along the fin span to swim the multiple wave propagations along the fin is shown in fig 8 a and b work by blevins et al blevins and lauder 2012 bottom et al bottom et al 2016 and daniel daniel 1988 describe how to model the three degree of freedom wave propagation expressed by rajiform species the modeling of the fin curvature was done using marker lines with multiple points that are perpendicular to the spine as presented in fig 8 c these extremely flexible fins are capable of multi directional wave propagation waves can translate from front to back and vice versa each fin can behave independently of the other each fin displaying its own wave direction allowing these animals to make null speed turns for amiiform and gymnotiform individual ribs and a flexible interstitial membrane make these fins extremely flexible and allow multiple periods to be expressed by the fins xiong and lauder 2013 sprinkle et al 2017 work by hu et al hu et al 2009 and youngerman et al youngerman et al 2014 are good examples of videography and modeling of amiiform and gymnotiform locomotion as depicted in fig 9 a and b respectively youngerman et al sprinkle et al 2017 described four different swimming styles for a gymnotiform and the corresponding wave propagations used in forward backward vertical and roll swimming each swimming style requires a specific wave propagation frequency amplitude and direction shown in fig 9 c a traveling wave for forward swimming changing position over time is marked by the dashed line efforts by hu et al hu et al 2009 model the ribbon fin kinematics of the amiiform which is synonymous with the gymnotiform flexibility of fin ribs and membrane is shown in fig 9 d 3 1 3 jet propulsion kinematic modeling the jet propulsion category is unique in that the whole body is flexible these animals do not have a rigid skeleton or rib structure therefore these creatures are entirely soft bodied however complex musculature structure allows these animals to contract and create thrust for jet propulsion the shape deformation is modeled to determine the volume displacement as shown in fig 10 the bell of the jellyfish has been observed for the flexion curves analyzed from the oblate and prolate shapes oblate jellyfish are described by a flatter shape with a large bell radius prolate jellyfish have more of a bullet shape where radii and body sizes are smaller than oblate jellyfish jellyfish produce the bell motion through constriction of muscles in the subumbrella allowing them to eject water out of the semi enclosed volume of their bell as explained by mchenry and jed mchenry and jed 2003 and dabiri et al dabiri et al 2005 jellyfish s motion consists of continuous contraction and relaxation phases oblate jellyfish are known to generate thrust by paddle swimming characterized by none symmetric bell constrictions prolate jellyfish have symmetric bell constriction often at a much higher frequency than the oblate the aurelia aurita exhibits both cases of the oblate and prolate swimming styles making them good candidates for observation fig 10 b allows for a clear observation of the contraction and relaxation phases created from the body markers in the videography experiments for aurelia aurita jellyfish as depicted in fig 10 a other subsections of the jet propulsion classification are the mantel constriction and combination of fin undulation with mantel constriction mantel constriction is expressed solely by animals like the octopus this animal utilizes inhalation of water into a mantel cavity and forcibly expelling it from a siphon creating thrust the combination class of mantel constriction and fin undulation pertains to animals that utilize the same mantel constriction as the octopus but also have undulatory fins capable for slow motion control biological species in this category are the squid and cuttlefish bartol et al bartol et al 2001 described the swimming behavior of the squid lolliguncula brevis by using video frames as shown in fig 11 a and b mantel constriction is achieved by the contraction of three directional muscle weave in the mantel johnson et al 1972 the mantel can fill more than twenty percent compared to the relaxed state and can expel this water till the mantel is more than fifteen percent smaller than the relaxed state johnson et al 1972 the cycle of mantel constriction is shown in fig 11 c bortal et al bartol et al 2001 also described that the squid uses its undulator fin in forward and backward swimming jet propulsion is primarily utilized in backward swimming for fast escapes weymouth et al 2015 3 2 physical modeling the physical modeling of the system is done most often through a theoretical assumption of the hydrodynamic parameters that partake in the swimming motion namely thrust and drag parameters of interest for studies are the reynolds re and strouhal st numbers which are a function of the frequencies investigators like cui et al hove et al 2001 define these parameters for carangiform fish and result in the following equations 2 r e l 2 t Ï where Ï is the kinematic viscosity t 1 f as t is the beating period and l denotes the fish length as for the strouhal number its expression is given in eq 4 where a m a x represents the maximum tail amplitude of oscillation and u is the speed of the fluid when the body is considered to be traveling at null speed cui et al 2017 tolkoff 1999 3 s t f a max u the lift and drag forces can be found through a simplified numerical or experimental analysis if the pressure and shear stress distribution are known over a studied shape then these forces can be found through eqs 5 and 6 as follows munson et al 2013 4 f d r a g f d p r e s s u r e f d v i s c o u s p cos Î¸ d a Ï w sin Î¸ d a 5 f l i f t f l p r e s s u r e f l v i s c o u s p sin Î¸ d a Ï w cos Î¸ d a these equations account for the effects of pressure differences and the viscous effects induced by the shape by integrating to get the total respective force in a coordinate direction munson et al 2013 these terms are most commonly found for airfoils abbott and doenhoff 1959 but more detailed force approximations are being made for objects of complex shape batchelor 2000 vasudev et al 2014 here the pressure p over the surface and the wall shear stress Ï w from the fluid moving past the surface abbott and doenhoff 1959 for assumed shapes coefficients for lift and drag can be approximated using eqs 7 and 8 munson et al 2013 for neutrally buoyant bodies lift from fins can be important for depth and roll control 6 c d f d r a g Ï u 2 a 2 7 c l f l i f t Ï u 2 a 2 one of the easiest assumptions that can be made for physical modeling can be to assume the shape of the body or fin to be similar to an airfoil this assumption has been made for fin oscillation and fin undulation categories khalid et al 2016 blevins and lauder 2012 moored and bart smith prats 2015 however this assumption is most commonly made for fin oscillation bergmann and lollo 2011 thrust production has been studied not only for an oscillating airfoil but also for a finite shape with flexibility over the span or chord length bergmann and lollo 2011 khalid et al 2016 an airfoil inspired robot using a rigid body oscillation to generate thrust is considered by pollard et al pollard and tallapragada 2017 4 hydrodynamic analyses the hydrodynamic analyses can be done using numerical or experimental methods these methods are used to better understand either the two dimensional or rather the three dimensional flows schosser et al 2016 numerical methods are considered for fins or body to determine flow characteristics ramamurti et al 2002 cui et al 2017 bottom et al 2016 prats 2015 tytell 2004 li et al 2016 liu et al 2012 liu et al 2015 hirata et al 2015 kodati et al 2008 studebaker et al 2016 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2008 fish et al 2016 borazjani and sotiropoulos 2009 the most simplified numerical method that investigated undulatory swimming motion is the waving plate theory wu 1961 techet et al 2004 analyses are performed using the governing equations for fluid flow which are given by abbott and doenhoff 1959 8 v 0 9 Ï t Ï u x Ï v y Ï w z 0 10 Ï u t u u x v u y w u z p x Ï g x Î¼ 2 u x 2 2 u y 2 2 u z 2 where eq 9 is the boundary condition for an incompressible flow eq 10 is the general continuity equation for the fluid and eq 10 is the general navier stokes equation in cartesian coordinates accounting for the flow in the x direction equation 10 also has two other equations that account for the y and z directions numerical methods can be performed using a multitude of capable software including but not limited to openfoam ltd 2011 2018 and ansys cfx ansys 2018 experimental analysis of fluid flow has been conducted in a still water and flow channel using high speed cameras capable of capturing fluid dynamics fermigier 2017 lauder 2011 behbahani and tan 2017 particle image velocimetry piv a form of pulse light velocimetry experiments have been conducted to study the effects that shapes have on a fluid by studying the velocity of particles in the fluid regime being displaced by the shape as shown in fig 12 ren et al 2015 lauder et al 2007 wen and lauder 2013 westerweel 1997 adrian 1991 lauder et al 2005 this imaging method is performed using 10 9 5 11 5 particles in every cubic meter krothapalli 1991 another imaging strategy based on smaller marker size is molecular markers like fluorescent ink which can be tracked for individual streamlines and vortices created adrian 1991 yamamoto 2017 a molecular marker experiment was considered for the jellyfish to gather the definite movement of its bell and the vortices the constriction creates dabiri et al 2005 through identification of particle velocity using piv fluid flow characteristics can be determined for the structure of interest fig 12 shows different fluid flow for a bcf fish swimming and one lateral pectoral fin for one instant of that motion piv yields areas of higher and lower pressure over the body the vortices produced and are helpful in determining the force generated by the body babu et al 2016 5 actuators by defining the actuators in categories based on their construction clear motion characteristics can be displayed groupings of rigid soft and biological components give examples for all the actuators considered as shown in fig 13 in the rigid actuator category the conventional actuators are described as linked systems that try to replicate the motion of spinal or fin rib structures the soft actuator category covers soft robotic actuators that could be considered in found systems biological actuators are expressed in brief detail as this is the newest category and is still highly experimental 5 1 rigid link actuators the linked systems are considered when the overall components do not deform in size and shape actuation is achieved through linkages of rigid component assemblies using electrical motors raj and thakur 2016 the conception of rigid component actuators capable of performing found motions from the biological or hydrodynamic analyses result in a great variety of designs these rigid actuators are categorized as follows single link multiple link and fin actuators table 1 at the end of this section gives examples for each rigid actuator section 5 1 1 single link actuator the single link systems are categorized for the caudal peduncle movement shown in fig 14 this actuator can either have the drive motor in the body or tail section these actuators are favorable because the thrust is generated from a simple assembly the reason this actuator type is considered for the thunniform species because the body undulation expressed by these creatures is restricted to the last section of the peduncle kopman and porfiri 2013 marras and porfiri 2012 this peduncle restriction is also expressed by the osctraciiform and labriform auv tail motion wang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 lachat et al 2006 behbahani and tan 2016 wang and xie 2014 5 1 2 multiple link actuator the multi link actuators give the peduncle a smoother curvature compared to the single link shown in fig 15 the more links used in the actuation the smoother the curve is as each link equivalates to an increase in joints the joints can be designed to have a single plane of freedom where the peduncle unit can move in a lateral or vertical motion relative to the bodies neutral position respectively clapham and hu 2014 liu et al 2005 tolkoff 1999 suebsaiprom et al 2016 hu et al 2006 liu and hu 2010 yu et al 2004 koca et al 2016 yu et al 2012 ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 liu and hu 2005 su et al 2014 wen et al 2012 yu et al 2016b liljeback et al 2014 shen et al 2011 anderson and chhabra 2002 stefanini et al 2012 the anguilliform category has the highest number of links usually more than six while the carangiform category regularly has five however one of the pioneer experimental designs the robotuna used more than five links powered by pulleys to achieve oscillation tolkoff 1999 power inputs for the multi link actuators are either the direct current dc motors or servomotors housed on each of these joints or at the base of the peduncle chu and zhu 2016 a unique multi link anguilliform robot was created using magnets to attract and repulse each link manfredi et al 2013 multi link actuators allow the inclusion of joints that can give the tail another degree of freedom for more flexibility a more flexible peduncle gives the tail more directional thrust capabilities and therefore more maneuvering capabilities ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 yu and wei 2013 yu et al 2009 rollinson et al 2014 5 1 3 fin actuators the fin actuators are considered for the systems that mimic rajiform labriform and ostraciiform species these systems vary between rib actuators and rigid paddle fin actuators the rib actuators give the wave propagation along the fin while the paddle fin considers the surface to be rigid the flexibility of ribs is dependent on the material but this actuator is included in this class because designs follow similar methodology as link systems paddle fin actuators have been used for control during swimming 5 1 3 1 rib actuators rib actuators are considered for systems that use individual rays to excite a flexible membrane as shown in fig 16 the rib actuators can be considered in three categories connected individual and passive the connected ribbed actuators are considered for systems by xie et al 2016 siahmansouri et al 2011 liu et al 2017 individual ribs are considered by hu et al 2009 yang et al 2009 zhou and low 2012 low et al 2011 shang et al 2012 curet et al 2011 these ribs are actuated through separate servomotors thus these systems have more than two actuators as presented fig 16 passive fins are considered by liu et al 2012 gao et al 2007 niu et al 2012 y alvarado et al 2013 chew et al 2015 sfakiotakis and fasoulas 2014 gilva et al 2015 these auvs have one or two rigid rib actuators that give undulation to a passive fin membrane flexible fin rays were found to increase the efficiency of undulating fin propulsion as it replicated the biological animal liu et al 2017 5 1 3 2 paddle fin actuators the paddle fin actuators are considered for the pectoral fin propulsion and the control surfaces of bcf auvs the pectoral fin propulsive actuators are considered for the auvs created by sitorus et al 2009 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2014 kodati et al 2008 lachat et al 2006 behbahani and tan 2016 zhang et al 2016 mainong et al 2017 wang et al 2017a castano et al 2017 the unique paddle fin created by zhang et al low and willy 2005 not only has propulsive pectoral fins but also has a dual caudal fin propulsion that gives this auv good stability and speed the auv created by kodati et al kodati et al 2008 supports propulsive pectoral fins that have two degrees of freedom to perform the rowing swimming method similar to the work of behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 as shown in fig 17 fins with 3 dof are desired these give the auv s more maneuvering capabilities shen et al 2011 the control surface paddle fin actuators are considered because they give the craft pitch and roll capabilities wen et al 2012 anderson and chhabra 2002 wu et al 2015 to obtain 3 dof for each fin a servomotor for each degree of freedom can be applied in the design shen et al 2011 it was described by behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2017 that a variable stiffness paddle fin exhibits much different performance characteristics than a rigid fin 5 1 4 motors and servomotors direct current motors are considered for these designs as they allow for strong torque and high rotational speeds servomotors are also used because they can be rotary or linear actuators furqan et al 2017 a common method to transform the mechanical input of the dc motors into oscillations is to use a scotch yoke mechanism rack and pinion or slider crank shen et al 2011 yu and wei 2013 the fin undulation uses gear sets to transform the servomotors into useful motion wang et al 2017b typical motors used for actuation are found in table 2 5 2 soft robotic actuators soft materials have been exploited in almost all categories of locomotion from all the known soft robotic actuators sras there are a few types that are capable of motions needed for swimming the various forms of the smart material actuators will be identified to determine systems that are capable of deformation from a stimulus like electricity the characteristics of each actuator is shown to discuss later the optimal sra candidates for auvs at the end of this section tables 3 and 4 are outlaid in a manner to express the characteristics and physical capabilities of each sra 5 2 1 shape memory alloys shape memory alloys smas are smart material actuators that have rising interest in soft robotics sma characteristics include high work density high chemical corrosion resistance deform locally in the presence of low voltages fail from cyclic fatigue movement is hysteric from the complex thermodynamic problem for phase change jani et al 2014 xiang et al 2017 cianchetti 2013 smas go through a material phase shift to use and recover strain potential of the crystalline lattice cianchetti 2013 there are different alloys used as smas including copper alloys and ternary alloys such as niticu but the most common is the nickel titanium niti alloy jani et al 2014 cianchetti 2013 the preference of this material is its super elasticity pseudoplasticity and shape memory effect shape memory effect refers to the recovery of the material s original shape after being deformed cianchetti 2013 smas can be fabricated in either a wire beam or sheet configuration cianchetti 2013 the sma actuators are continually being developed to try improving their performance xiang et al 2017 smas have been employed in a variety of soft robotic systems with different kinds of movements based on a sma wire configuration many systems developed have been inspired from worms caterpillars and octopus a support structure is needed for the sma wires as shown in fig 18 a flexible nylon mesh structure is used but other elastomers have also been implemented cianchetti et al 2012 follador et al 2012 the wires must be inlayed in this support matrix to create directional deformation and force the selection of direction depends on the flexion and recovery that is trying to be achieved circumferential and longitudinal sma wires shown in fig 18 a and b are implemented to mimic the muscles of a worm that elongate and shorten the body circumferential wires contract to decrease diameter thus lengthening the body counteractively its length is shortened by the longitudinal wires contracting which increases the diameter thus shortening the body the body does not bend it only exhibits elongation and contraction which produces a peristaltic movement cianchetti et al 2012 follador et al 2012 seok et al 2013 an octopus like robotic arm was also developed using radial and longitudinal sma springs the radial sma springs constricts the radius and increases the arm to its original length fig 18 c shows the radial system set up using sma springs asymmetric position of wire can cause bending for a respective system the i bot inspired from a caterpillar uses two sma coils on one side of the silicone body when activated independently causing an inchworm motion this motion is initiated by a bending wave in the posterior part of the system tilting the contact angle of the rear foot when the threshold angle for friction is exceeded the rear foot is dragged forwards umedachi et al 2016 another caterpillar based robot is the goqbot sma coil actuators within silicone are activated simultaneously to constrict the body into a circle causing a ballistic rolling motion trimmer et al 2013 lin et al 2011 laschi et al 2016 wang et al 2009 designed a micro mimetic manta ray robotic system actuated with sma wires running longitudinally in an elastomer beam this beam is a flexible leading edge fin rib that gives undulations to a passive fin membrane the sma causes flexion in the beam because it is inlaid in the polymer off the neutral axis and when it is activated the shrinkage causes the bending in favor of the activated side kim et al 2016 kim et al kim et al 2016 devised a design based on a polymer matrix inlaid with a plastic to encourage a vertical flexion a biomimetic cuttlefish robot designed by wang et al wang et al 2011 and fabricated by gao et al gao et al 2014 uses sma wires for the undulated fin and the mantel constriction of the system the undulatory fin serves for slow swimming while the mantle is for higher speed jet propulsion wang et al 2011 the undulating fin works using sma wires distributed throughout the membrane the sma wires in the mantel are circumferential allowing constriction of the mantel cavity gao et al 2014 another sma category named bio inspired shape memory alloy composite actuators bismac actuators was used it can convert the high force and low strain of sma wire to a lower force with larger bending deformations smith et al 2010 the structure of this actuator is composed of the most common niti alloy sma wire and a thin medium carbon steel fixed in silicone as shown in fig 19 smith et al 2010 this actuator has the ability of being configured to different deformation profiles although bismac actuator can reach a larger deformation it still has hysteresis and delay when changing to its original position villanueva et al 2010 smith et al smith et al 2010 were able to analyze the reflective points on the actuator they recorded a maximum deformation of 93 4 100 by using 4 sma wires while there was almost no change by adding 3 to 6 wires smith et al 2010 robojelly is a bioinspired jellyfish robot designed and fabricated by villanueva et al villanueva et al 2013 that replicates shape and motion of the aurelia aurita jellyfish the required deformation of 44 for the aurelia aurita using single sma wires alone it would not function to replicate the contraction since they can only deform by 4 villanueva et al 2013 the fabricated robojelly consists of 8 bismac actuators fixed inside the rtv silicone bell villanueva et al 2013 5 2 2 cable driven unlike other soft material auvs presented in this review paper cable driven auvs are powered by servomotors or gas marchese et al 2015 cai et al 2009 the function of the servomotors is to produce bending by shortening the wires which causes flexion of the skeletal structure wires on each robot have different set up depending on the kind of deformation desired fig 20 shows the longitudinal set up for a robotic fish lau et al 2015 cownose ray auv cai et al 2009 and the radial set up for an octopus inspired jet propulsion system giorgio serchi et al 2013 several robotic systems have been developed using cable driven actuation octopus sea star and caudal fin species have motions that can be replicated using this actuation robot shark is composed of an elastic beam with six rigid disc links mimicking the fish skeleton with wires running longitudinally down the peduncle as shown in fig 20 a lau et al 2015 the servomotor on the robot shark drives a drum wheel controlling the pull on the wires that cause a bending of the peduncle and oscillates by altering the rotation of the actuator a robotic fish was created in the same manner but with five discs and complaint last section of the tail with high similarity of motion to the biological zhong et al 2017 a gas power pneumatic muscle of the flexible foil cownose ray auv contracts a flexible multi section leading edge fin rib using rope running on the top side of the rib as presented in fig 20 b however this design only capable of a fin upstroke cai et al 2009 by using silicone rubber the fin span can be given the shape of the fin and giving a high morphology similarity to the biological system cai et al 2009 poseidrone inspired from an octopus combines crawling and jet propulsion mechanisms the crawling system is made of radially distributed arms each with longitudinal wires running from the motor to the tip of the arm giorgio serchi et al 2017 cables allow each arm to elongate shorten and stiffen which also allows the robot to grab objects the swimming unit consists of a silicone bladder with a nozzle and ingestion valve giorgio serchi et al 2013 this bladder is connected to radially distributed wires as shown in fig 20 c once it is filled with fluid a servomotor pulls these cables contracting the bladder thus producing ejection of the fluid causing thrust while the bladder returns to its original shape fluid is being ingested and the ejection process is repeated arienti et al 2015 giorgio serchi et al 2013 a feather sea star was the inspiration for a soft robot that is composed mostly of linear and circular springs that aid in generating propulsion francis et al 2015 nir et al 2012 5 2 3 shape memory polymers similar to smas shape memory polymers smps can deform and return to their original shape in the presence of a stimuli smps are an elastic polymer matrix with stimuli sensitive switches although not many auvs have been made using these kind of actuators they present characteristics that give them potential these actuators use other kinds of stimuli rather than electricity such as chemical light and magnetic fields the shape recovery time of smp can be a short time for a large deformation range but larger deformations risk a longer response time behl and lendlein 2007 shape memory polymers have many applications especially for micro electromechanical systems and actuators in biomedical devices trabia et al 2015 ricotti and fujie 2017 these applications include laser activated device that can remove blood clots to biodegradable implants that inflate to help control appetite to reduce obesity behl and lendlein 2007 these polymers have been considered as better substitutes to metallic materials due to their biocompatibility and flexibility giving them the capability to be used in other applications laschi and cianchetti 2014 5 2 4 electroactive polymers electroactive polymer eap actuators are excited through electrical stimulus and they are classified into electronic dielectric elastomers and ionic ionic polymer metallic composites trivedi et al 2008 eaps have characteristics such as low weight fracture tolerance and large actuation strain dielectric elastomers require high voltage to operate but they have a quicker response and produce large strains 5 2 4 1 dielectric elastomers dielectric elastomers de have resemblance to animal muscles based on strain pressure density efficiency and speed pelrine et al 2002a when voltage is applied to the electrodes the opposite charges in the electrodes attract each other generating stress in the dielectrics this stress causes deformation in the de in the form of a compression and lateral expansion mirfakhrai et al 2007 a sra inspired by a jellyfish was created using dielectric elastomers this system has an air chamber connected one end to a de membrane and the other end is a valve that pumps air in when the de expands godaba et al 2016 the de membrane is filled by a defined amount of air the de in this case is stimulated when voltage is applied on the actuator the membrane expands increasing its air volume which helps the system to float the jellyfish robot generates propulsion by ejecting water and by expanding the de membrane creating thrust 5 2 4 2 ionic polymer metallic composites ionic polymer metallic composites ipmcs can be used when deformations such as bending and twisting are needed in design trabia et al 2016 ipmc using voltage as stimuli will be explained besides electricity these materials can also be stimulated by chemicals light and magnetic fields chen et al 2012 they consist of a polyelectrolyte membrane in between metallic electrode chen et al 2012 this membrane contains a proportionate number of anions and cations in the membrane matrix when voltage is applied cations move to the negatively charged electrode causing an imbalance in the structure fig 21 shows a high concentration of cations on just one side causes the deformation in the actuator but it does not produce a strong force pelrine et al 2002a chen et al 2012 the bioinspired jellyfish robot designed and fabricated by najem et al najem et al 2012 uses ipmc actuators to mimic the propulsion of the aequorea victoria jellyfish due to its similarities with the motion of the bell to achieve the curved shape of the bell dc voltage was applied to the four ipmc najem et al 2012 a second system utilizing ipmc actuators to mimic locomotion of biological jellyfish is the biomimetic jellyfish robot designed by yeom and oh yeom and oh 2009 unlike the first robotic system the ipmc actuators for this robotic jellyfish have been given a thermal treatment of 80 c for 1 h which allowed for a better flexion yeom and oh 2009 yeom and oh yeom and oh 2009 stated that applying dc voltage to a flat ipmc actuator could not hold for a constant curvature and its return to original shape is hysteric in this design an input signal was implemented in the robot to mimic the rapid changes between the fast pulse phase and the slow recovery phase yeom and oh 2009 chen et al chen et al 2010 introduced the concept of a biomimetic robotic fish actuated by ipmc actuators a plastic caudal fin was designed to be attached to the ipmc beam to provide the thrust chen et al 2010 the implementation of a wider beam would cause a curling effect instead of bending deformation therefore the beam length is an important factor in the design chen et al 2012 robotic rajiforms also utilize ipmc in place of the rib actuators individual strips are integrated into a polymer sheet and are activated to cause the wave propagations from the sequenced bending of the ipmc chen et al chen et al 2012 created a bioinspired robotic manta ray using two pectoral fins fabricated by a single ipmc beam actuator with a passive fin membrane chen et al 2012 punning et al punning et al 2004 and takagi et al takagi et al 2006 created multi rib ipmc actuators but found that it was difficult to cause the complex wave undulations through selective activation 5 2 5 piezoelectric materials piezoelectric material is a smart material and has applications for auvs because it vibrates at lower frequencies using low voltage electric excitation applicable piezoelectric material is a macro fiber composite mfc actuator mfc materials are composed of cts wireless components 3195hd lead zirconate titanate that was bound by epoxy high and wilkie 2003 mfc has low strain properties during vibration but the stress is moderate they work as cantilever beams and have been implemented into caudal fin designs due to the oscillatory vibration this type of smart material actuators show promise because they bend in plane directions freely and do not exhibit fatigue failure during long cycles moreover this actuator does generate heat only one auv has been found to have used the piezoelectric actuator work by cen and erturk cen and erturk 2013 created a piezoelectric actuator caudal fin the piezoelectric material was fixed to a rigid body that housed all the batteries and electrical components 5 2 6 hydraulic pressure channels in an elastomer matrix are put under stress using hydraulic pressure shown in fig 22 a marchese et al 2015 consequently strain is produced and bending occurs as shown in fig 22 b and c these actuators can be manipulated to generate the desired stress by controlling the amount and which channels the fluid goes through marchese et al 2015 marchese et al 2014 soft robotic fish where the peduncle is composed entirely of fluidic elastomer actuators feas have been developed one design has a hydraulic pump that includes a gas regulation mechanism and a delivery system to control the fluid pressure onal et al 2011 the fea fish by marchese et al marchese et al 2014 can reach a maximum bending angle of 100 using the anterior and posterior agonistic and antagonistic body actuators katzschmann et al katzschmann et al 2016 katzschmann et al 2018 developed a very capable system that performed an endurance mission in a real world mission in an oceanic environment the vorticity control unmanned undersea vehicle vcuuv is a solid multi link actuated robot and was inspired by the robotuna made by massachusetts institute and technology researchers the vcuuv s hydraulic actuator has multiple tubes connected to each link in the chain to create a powerful motion this robot is a unique design where no other system found was this large or used rigid links actuated by hydraulic pressure anderson and chhabra 2002 5 3 biohybrid actuators the biohybrid actuator refers to an integration of muscular tissue and artificial structures capable of imitating the performance of living structures with regards to stiffness and contraction phases ricotti and fujie 2017 park et al 2016 ricotti and menciassi 2012 this type of actuator would allow for greater adaptation flexibility and power to soft robots ricotti and fujie 2017 in addition they can operate at high efficiency and harvest energy from the nutrients available from their surroundings park et al 2016 biohybrid actuators can show a higher efficiency over the standard artificial actuators because muscle has a high power to weight ratio ricotti and fujie 2017 these actuators are constructed by applying a nano scale thickness of membrane improves muscle contractions for these actuators because muscle bundles must be small layers to this point ricotti and fujie 2017 park et al park et al 2016 designed and fabricated a robotic stingray utilizing photonic excited biohybrid actuator which had reproducible fin undulation motion capable turning scenarios as depicted in fig 23 a this system creates coordinated undulating fin motion and phototactically controlled motion using a sensory motor system park et al 2016 the composition of the biohybrid system includes a 3d elastomer body a gold skeleton an interstitial elastomer coating and a layer of cardiomyocytes in a body that was smaller than a penny park et al 2016 the thin gold skeleton stores elastic energy during the stroke and rebounds during the relaxation phase which reduced the complexity of the design park et al 2016 nawroth et al nawroth et al 2012 worked on the fabrication of a tissue engineered jellyfish inspired by the aurelia aurita as presented in fig 23 b the motion of the system was derived by applying electrical impulses to the bell thus giving a synchronized movement nawroth et al 2012 the composition of the medusoid is based on a combination of anisotropic cardiomyocytes and an elastic silicone nawroth et al 2012 the sheet of muscle tissue contracted the bell and an elastomer returns to original shape nawroth et al 2012 due to the lack of controlling the muscle contraction the robotic jellyfish could not achieve the turning and maneuvering tasks nawroth et al 2012 6 materials material selection is broad and is dependent on the type of actuator selected as stated these materials are separated into two categories rigid and soft these groups organized the important material properties elasticity stiffness yield ultimate tensile strength ductility hardness toughness fatigue strength endurance limit and creep resistance these properties must be considered when designing systems based on their actuator 6 1 rigid materials found rigid components are grouped together based on their higher stiffness these materials do not exhibit high elastic deformation selection is based off cost of design motion of actuation machining capabilities to produce the desired shape and specified biological characteristics to replicate to machine complex parts computer aided manufacturing cam machine tools are utilized because low tolerance of materials is needed generally rigid materials are used for larger components that can handle a higher amount of stress and the desired elastic deformation to be extremely low these materials are grouped in table 5 some of these rigid materials can exhibit flexibility depending on structure where they will be used like fin ribs that are desired to have some complacence 6 2 soft materials soft materials include materials that can express large elastic deformations and can return to original shape deformation can either happen passively or through impulse to the material like electricity the utility of these materials is that they can bend with the desired motion rubber materials like silicone can be used to waterproof and protect actuators elastomers can be used to encase moving components like fins and behave similarly to biological animals the soft material actuators are grouped in table 6 to show material characteristics general soft materials are grouped in table 7 7 sensors sensors play an important role in giving systems sense of their environment orientation and offer utility like animals auvs need to be able to recognize and adapt to their surroundings maintain control and take sample data obstacle recognition position depth pressure stability acceleration inertia force torque system electrical current usage system water leakage water temperature and ph sensors are used by bioinspired and non bioinspired systems decreasing the size of these sensors allows for systems to use more than one giving the systems a broader range of capabilities smaller components fit in the limited body cavity space there is a wide range of components available for selection to make these systems autonomous the sensors used are found in table 8 obstacle recognition sensors include infrared camera sonar and electrolocation infrared and cameras use light waves to capture underwater bodies sonar is the sensing of reflected sound pings emitted from the body kanhere 2017 electrolocation is the recognition of obstacles due to their alteration of the electronic field kanhere 2017 the most commonly used obstacle detection sensor is the infrared sensor the lateral line is a sensitive array of sensory organs along the side body of biological animals is used for obstacle awareness from fluid movement kanhere 2017 lateral line sensor designed by kottapalli et al kottapalli and asadnia 2017 describes a variety of hair cell sensors that can detect fluid flow with high sensitivity a pressure sensor array was considered by nelson et al nelson and mohseni 2017 and wang et al wang et al 2017a to try to mimic the lateral line but have yet to implement this array in a bioinspired auv gps keeps the system swimming between objectives stability acceleration inertia force and torque sensors keep the system stable verify forces exhibited by the structure and resulting stresses and torques in the structure electrical and water leakage sensors monitor the electrical components to make sure battery life is optimized and the system does not short circuit pressure and depth sensors are used to keep systems out of failure depths and swimming at the correct depth data collection sensors are not needed for autonomy but rather for aquatic surveying options sensors included in this group are temperature and ph sensors these give the capability to test the water column and give useful data points difficult to obtain over large volumes 8 batteries the different types of batteries used are mainly lithium polymer lithium ion and nickel metal hydride these are rechargeable batteries that each has its own respective composition to separate and store charge the ni mh batteries are a cheaper option but do not have long life in comparison with the li ion and li polymer buchmann 2017 ni mh do not have harmful metal compounds so pollution potential is null which is not the case for li ion or li polymer buchmann 2017 li polymer can be made into many sizes extremely thin or large but are generally lightweight buchmann 2017 li ion has potential to be the most powerful but is the most expensive of the three exhibited as it is still not manufactured in large scale buchmann 2017 the used batteries for auvs applications are depicted in table 9 9 critical discussion constraints limitations and future recommendations all the previous sections show critical background necessary prior to discussing trends and offering our observational comments and future recommendations a conceived design cycle for auvs is shown in fig 24 this figure is the overview for necessary steps needed to create bioinspired or more preferably biomimetic auvs the control units that should be considered in the electronics selection have not been investigated because they require an in depth investigation to push the boundaries of autonomy there are multiple aspects of bioinspiration that lead to more biomimetic designs primarily the selection of the locomotion type and respective animals should have the largest influence in the design generally a design should account for every constraint from the biological animal including sizing kinematics physics and hydrodynamics sizing is not included in this paper as this requires an understanding of multiple case representations for each biological locomotion as mentioned in salazar et al 2018a this review gives examples of how the kinematics are derived obtaining some physical phenomena of the system and hydrodynamic analyses all these methods attempt to model the intended system to gain a more fundamental understanding to create a functioning auv the actuator selection is dependent on the modeling of the system and the materials desired to replicate the motion and structures of the inspirational animal the electronics help auvs be more autonomous and react to their surroundings control systems for actuators are not consolidated in this review as they require a separate in depth review indeed control strategies are different for rigid and soft actuators and should be considered post actuator selection design recommendations will be made to help lead future investigators to build capable swimming designs 9 1 swimming style first the desired swimming style must be selected the main categories are fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion as shown in fig 25 fin oscillation and fin undulation categories utilize similar fins tail pectoral dorsal and anal however fin oscillation species that solely utilize the body caudal fin bcf exhibit the fastest speeds jet propulsion are characterized for animals that force water out of a constricting volume 9 2 kinematic modeling the kinematics includes determining the body shape and size of the animal and representing the motion of these structures caudal fin animals require an understanding of the mechanics of the bcf spinal flexion including head and tail displacement pectoral dorsal and anal fins necessitate an understanding of the fin edge leading trailing displacement relative to the fin root and how the fin span reacts to the torsion caused by the edge displacement what has not been implemented into design or study is a combination of pectoral dorsal anal and caudal fins for the ostraciiform li et al 2016 however fin kinematics are much more complex than the bcf in fact many used models did not include the torsion and large deformation for fin flexibility work by blevins et al blevins and lauder 2012 attempts to include these three dimensional effects of the rajiform fin beam and plate theories can also be modified to attempt to explain these flexible fins the animals in fin oscillation and fin undulation classes have more rigid fin ribs in the membrane these composite fins increase the fin stiffness and create great propulsive and control surfaces one thing to note for all these animals is that the body composition and structure determine the rigidity of the body and fins bony fish usually have vertebrae and fin ribs as shown in table 10 the more vertebrae that the spinal column is segmented into the more flexible and undulatory the body can be alternatively the spine can become more rigid with less joints and transfer powerful concentrated fin strokes fin rib rigidity depends on the size and density of the rib tail fins tend to have a large number of fins that create semi rigid structures if fin ribs have multiple segments the structure is for sure more flexible cartilaginous animals can have individual or interconnected fin rib structures to either give isolated control or structural support the fin structure of the bony fish are individual fin structures that besides for the caudal fin are attached to the spine for the ghost knife fish the rib structures of the undulatory fin are segmented and varying in thickness and density the gymnotiform s last rib is what these animals use to control the fin membrane the animals in the jet propulsion category lack rigid structures and express large body deformation the kinematic modeling needs to adapt to include the flexibility of fins and bodies for these animals animals in all the categories exhibit some form of body flexibility the variation of body flexibility depends on the animal shape musculature and skeletal structure fins have varying flexibility depending on the composition of excitation structures fin oscillation animals have more rigid fin ribs in the membrane while fin undulation animals rib structures are much more flexible the jet propulsion animal s bodies are largely independent of any rigid structures so their bodies are the most flexible out of the three categories 9 3 physical modeling the physical modeling gives the reynolds number and strouhal number if frequency of oscillation length of animal the amplitude of oscillation fluid viscosity and fluid speed are known parameters however obtaining the thrust and drag for these systems is more complicated the pressure and shear stress distribution of the fluid over the body need to be known to obtain these terms this poses a difficult engineering problem if the exact solution is desired because it requires a complex understanding of the fluid regime this is done through the hydrodynamic analysis assumed generalities about the thrust and drag can be made to obtain the coefficients of thrust and drag assumptions about the shape of interest can yield a simplified result for the thrust and drag 9 4 hydrodynamic analyses there are two methods used to understand the fluid mechanics of the system namely experimental and numerical experimental methods study the biological animals and auv swimming utilizing piv these cameras are capable of tracking velocity of particles this is extremely useful as it offers a solution for the pressure and shear stress for the fluid regime the quality of the piv analysis is dependent on the equipment used the more expensive units are capable of more detailed sensing ultimately these high speed sensory cameras give flow characteristics to determine the forces on the body which is done by integrating the pressure and wall shear over the shape this technique also helps to study material response of the auv during swimming like similar fin and body morphology to the biological these methods do not only help to determine constraints of design but also work as a validating step for future work the numerical methods are much more tedious in comparison with experimental analysis these methods use software to complete complex computations where generalities or assumptions are made to obtain a solution creating moving structures that are precise replicas of biological structures is difficult in simulations analysis using a rigid body are common for motions like the bcf movement an assumption of body shape to a symmetric shape airfoil is also common there are cases of computational fluid dynamics cfd analysis for almost all kinds of fish locomotion but inclusion of body motion with fin motion is rare the numerical methods are tedious requiring a good understanding of the structural shape of the animal the locomotion kinematics and one must have a firm understanding of fluid dynamics 9 5 actuator selection creating a perfectly capable auv is still years away but major advances are being made with actuator development actuator selection is difficult because of the complex architecture and motions of the biological animals which actuators need to replicate this review has described the known actuators that have been or could be included in auvs to give an expansive representation of the possibilities to be used in design the actuators have been organized into rigid and soft categories 9 5 1 rigid actuators rigid actuators have better thrust capabilities as motors provide powerful mechanical input where the body structure is made stronger with rigid links bcf rigid link actuators try to replicate the spinal flexion but they lack the multi dimensional spinal flexibility that the animals have inclusion of planar joints to the main link chain attempts to replicate this phenomenon but still lacks this flexibility including another plane of motion to create flexibility rigid rib actuators have been shown that they can cause wave propagations in a flexible fin membrane tests utilizing more flexible ribs caused higher thrust than the stiffer ribs paddle fin actuators have been proven useful in propulsive and maneuvering control propulsive paddle fins utilize either flapping or rowing motion there have not been designs that try and utilize both paddle fins used for maneuvering control exhibit the best capabilities when they are capable of more degrees of freedom to control roll and pitch in table 11 the advantages and disadvantages of rigid actuators are summarized 9 5 1 1 link actuators single link is the most simplistic design as there is only one joint that exhibits rotation and requires a single oscillating servomotor this type of actuator has been used in thunniform and ostraciiform designs as these require a more isolated peduncle oscillation to the caudal fin the issue with these systems is that they lack directional control because the peduncle only has one planar direction of motion these designs have utilized rigid plastics for the component construction the multiple link actuators are much more diverse than the single link the inclusion of the more joints makes the peduncle more flexible similar to the biological phenomena this allows the rigid links to match up with the motion model for the backbone of the caudal fin fishes these links are composed of materials like metals or rigid plastics the anguilliform auvs include many more joints than the carangiform designs where carangiforms generally have less than five joints this limitation for the carangiform is from the links being restricted to the peduncle section anguilliform designs which include more than ten small links like that of stefanini et al stefanini et al 2012 creates an extremely flexible body carangiform designs like the isplash incorporate links that are over the whole body that give a more realistic whole body flexion as it creates a head oscillation clapham and hu 2014 an issue with including more joints is that the control for the motion becomes more difficult studying control methods requires a more exclusive study the robotic dolphin design by yu et al yu et al 2016b utilized a flexible head joint to mimic head oscillations of a biological dolphin the inclusion of a head joint in combination with powerful dc motors allowed this design to achieve a fast enough speed to propel the auv out of the water a robotic dolphin by yu et al yu and wei 2013 included a lateral joint at the base of the peduncle giving a different flexion of the peduncle for turning researchers are trying to integrate these link systems into traditional propeller based systems to enhance endurance and performance like that in scaradozzi et al scaradozzi et al 2017b 9 5 1 2 rib actuators the connected rib actuators utilize a connected crank system requiring only one mechanical input for this system the utility of this design is that the control of the wave propagation is based on how the crank design transmits the mechanical energy down the chain each rib moves in a perpendicular plane to the body and oscillates in a singular plane the issues with this design are that you cannot alter the wave amplitudes along the fin the motion is fixed to the designed requirements only frequency of oscillation can be altered by increasing the input signal for the crank chain this actuator type does not give the independent rib excitation like the biological animals the individual rib actuators have an input motor on each rib that is connected to the body the servomotors require a control signal to initiate and advance the wave propagation like the connected rib actuators the servomotors cause the rib to rise and plunge in a single plane the utility of this actuator type is the ability to control the amplitude of each rib and the direction of the wave propagation a majority of the auvs found utilize the individual rib actuators the difficulty of these systems is that controlling the servomotors in sequential order with the correct amplitude to give the best efficiency requires a deeper understanding of the response of the system curet et al curet et al 2011 created a capable undulatory fin but the body of these designs are rigid the assemblies of these auvs lack the spinal rigidity which the inspirational biological animals have the single rib passive fins require less motors than the individual rib the single rib rises and plunges in oscillation like the two other actuators in this class then a travelling wave is transmitted passively across the attached membrane this actuator type is simple and has already been integrated into a working rajiform auv design by niu et al niu et al 2012 with future development this actuator could be a good choice as it is simple requires less motors but has still proven to be a capable auv 9 5 1 3 paddle fin the rigid paddle fin actuators have utility for both propulsion and maneuvering control propulsive caudal fin designs are usually only planar oscillation similar to the single link design however the joint is right at the fin base these actuators only cause actuation to the fin but because of the aqueous environment the body experiences a torque causing issues with directional control these single caudal fin actuators tend to cause yaw instability to the auv a method to counteract this is to use two caudal paddle fins like the design by zhang et al zhang et al 2016 propulsive pectoral fins are inspired by the labriform and ostraciiform rowing and flapping motion utilizing planar oscillator paddle fin actuators that have a single degree of freedom for rowing makes them inefficient designs such as behbahani et al behbahani and tan 2016 overcome this high drag by making a flexible feathering joint to replicate the rowing motion of the labriform the paddle fins can also be used as maneuvering control surfaces either a one two or three degree of freedom fin can be created allowing these auvs to adjust pitch roll and yaw shen et al 2011 designs that do use the higher degree of freedom do tend to be larger as more actuators or complex mechanism must be integrated around the fin joint these fins can act as wings and have even been used for gliding to conserve energy during swimming this can be seen in work done by wu et al wu et al 2015 9 5 2 soft actuators soft robotics can be explained by systems that predominately use elastic materials for sure there is an amount variation of soft materials used in these auvs where some components might be solid based however the actuators themselves are considered flexible capable of deformations to achieve locomotion actuators capable of this are sma ipmc piezoelectric cable driven hydraulic and biohybrid smp can bend but have not been implemented into auv design de are capable of expansion but are inefficient for auvs sma are the most powerful smart materials sma wires are integrated into a flexible material and is heavily dependent on location of attachment as off neutral axis of attachment causes the bending using a spring steel for the bismac actuator creates a better bending and return as it can be used for attachment guides ipmc are more capable at making large deformations but are not as powerful as sma piezoelectric is one of the smart materials that offers a solution for oscillatory bending cable driven actuators depend on the contraction of the wires and has been shown that it can be implemented into fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion designs the utilization of powerful servomotors with flexible wires and more mimetic body shapes makes these designs a good representation of realizing more mimetic designs hydraulic actuators show promise in bcf designs as the completely elastomer peduncle can perform the high flexural oscillatory bending in table 12 advantages and disadvantages of soft actuators are consolidated 9 5 2 1 shape memory alloys as it was mentioned before smas raised a lot of interest in the soft robotics field because of their extremely high power to weight ratio and shape memory effect however the strain of sma is low and exhibit fatigue failure on the order of 2 107 cycles zhang and sun 2017 among the alloys available for these actuators the niti alloys are the best option since they present the best memory and super elasticity they can be deformed by using low voltages and have a high resistance to chemical corrosion these actuators exhibit a control issue that come from the hysteresis of the shape memory effect and cooling smas show less strain and a lower efficiency than the ipmc and piezoelectric different kinds of bending motion can be achieved by smas depending on the structure and layout of the sma the movement produced by worms is a common type of motion among auvs fabricated with these actuators this is because the longitudinal and circumferential radial sma wires alternate to cause peristaltic movement using circumferential sma wires makes the robotic system contract its diameter and longitudinal wires shorten the length of the body the low strain of the sma was altered by using a spring steel as a mounting substrate where the sma has an off axial loading on the spring steel to cause larger bending this combination is outlined as the bismac actuators and was used in jellyfish auvs and can present a good planform for future designs following villanueva et al villanueva et al 2013 it is recommended that this smart material sees improvements in hysteresis control and longer lifespan before reliable long swimming missions can be carried out using this actuator 9 5 2 2 cable driven unlike other actuators used in soft robotics cable driven requires a servomotor or pneumatic pressure to produce the pulling of cables thus causing motion these inputs are more constant and reliable than a majority of the smart actuators like sma actuators cables shorten to cause off axial bending or pull on a membrane this is the only actuator that has exhibited motion capability in all three classes fin oscillation fin undulation and jet propulsion the difficulty with these systems is that the motion is a direct correlation of the actuation assembly the desired motion replication can see great improvements with this class with future development a peduncle with flexible links and a compliant caudal fin was created by zhong et al zhong et al 2017 and is capable of performing the spatio temporal function given in eq 1 with great similarity this is one of the best soft designs capable of fin oscillation a flexible leading edge fin rib with a passive undulating fin was created by cai et al cai et al 2009 this design used pneumatic stimulus to pull on a rope that ran over the top of the flexible fin rib however this system could perform only an upstroke motion investigation should be done to create a downstroke for this design as then it would be more mimetic a mantel compression bladder was constructed by giorgio serchi et al giorgio serchi et al 2013 in this design direct fixture points in the silicone mantel are pulled to a central servomotor causing a decrease in volume in the future this actuator type shows great promise to be developed and matured into reliable swimming auvs 9 5 2 3 shape memory polymer and dielectric elastomer the smart material actuators in this section need further work to become efficient in their implementation on the soft robotics field the smps do not use direct current rather they use chemicals or magnetic fields as stimuli instead these alternative stimuli are more difficult to implement into an autonomous auv design although it demonstrates good capabilities as an actuator there is no previous work of them being used to fabricate auvs de shows a higher response time and a higher strain than ipmcs but they require a higher voltage to operate the large amount of strain is produced due to the compliance of the electrodes with the elastomer there may be a utility in the future for de as bioinspired systems due to their resemblance to animal muscles based on density elasticity pressure efficiency and speed but currently they lack the performance needed 9 5 2 4 ionic polymer metallic composites ipmc actuators are a smart material and have been implemented into robotic systems for their bending and twisting deformation capabilities to achieve their bending deformations these actuators use applications of either dc voltage thermal treatment light chemicals or magnetic fields stimulus through dc voltage to the actuator is the most applicable in auvs as it is a low voltage input if the ipmc beam is a free cantilever then the curvature for each cycle of load is not exact as heat stored by the material plays a role in the curvature and return to unbent shape if the beam is to large then curling of the ipmc can occur theoretically alternating the polarity on the actuator should cause bending in both directions but due to the thermal capacitance the flexion will not be symmetric yeom and hu yeom and oh 2009 found that a heat treatment for these actuators could be beneficial to achieve a better flexion the ipmc jellyfish have difficulties with flexion response during activation and relaxation phase with improvements to this smart material it could have many more applications in the three classes if the response time between flexion cycles can be reduced 9 5 2 5 piezoelectric materials piezoelectric material actuators are stimulated by low voltage inputs and are constructed in beam designs like the design of cen and erturk cen and erturk 2013 this actuator offers a moderate power to weight ratio that can perform oscillatory bending vibration the deformations of these actuators are not large but the work time is dependent on how long power is supplied piezoelectric actuators are not as incombered by the heat transfer problem as the ipmc so bending cycles can be induced much more regularly and for longer periods depending on power supply this type of actuator is not often utilized in auv design but has possibilities for fluttering fins in the future caudal fin designs should incorporate a flexible peduncle shell over the piezoelectric material to help improve bioinspiration 9 5 2 6 hydraulic pressure robotic systems using fluid actuation show promising capabilities such as high flexibility power and quick response time using hydraulic actuators is much more complex since onboard systems are required that will help control them such systems will help supply power to the rest of the systems deliver the fluid throughout the channels control the fluid s pressure and control the robot with a communication and control system all powered systems are stored in a rigid region of the robotic system the need of all these systems makes soft robots be less efficient than rigid bodied robots katzschmann et al katzschmann et al 2016 katzschmann et al 2018 recently tested their auv in a real world oceanic mission for a remote controlled carangiform auv this design had depth control and showed capable forward swimming motion the next step for this design is to make the system completely autonomous clever design could yield auvs in the fin undulation and jet propulsion and be an actuator of choice alongside the cable driven however the complex design of the fluidic chambers and their expansion to pressure presents a difficult challenge to overcome 9 5 2 7 biohybrid biohybrid actuators have shown greater efficiency as they are true biological muscle and they are the closest approach to mimic biological system however since these systems are new they are still highly experimental some biohybrid systems lack certain capabilities as turning and maneuvering the application of ultra thin membranes nano scale thickness is utilized because it allows for a higher deformation from the muscle contraction if functioning muscle could be engineered and implemented as a larger actuator it could change how we look at biorobotics the biohybrid actuators are the most capable of achieving biomimicry as real muscle is integrated into a polymer based design the difficulty for these designs are that they are still in small scale large muscle packaging has not been achieved but with further advances in biomechanics the possible applications for these actuators could be endless advancements in muscular construction for the biohybrid can result in larger designs that are more powerful 9 6 materials the material selection when building an auv depends greatly on the locomotion and design trying to be achieved combination of the materials gives improvements of flexibility for more rigid systems and give soft systems better translated power however rigid actuators require a large majority of components to be inflexible giving the assembly structure strength the rigid actuators are moving to be more flexible by including flexible joints more links and flexible ribs peduncle units for multi link designs are often crafted out of aluminum or rigid plastic due to their cheapness and machinability how soft actuators can improve sma need to perform higher cycles before failure ipmc requires improvement in power sma and ipmc need to determine the best heat transfer dissipation techniques and piezoelectric material need to be able to perform larger deformations to produce better thrust it was found that cable driven actuators show the best combination crossover between the rigid and soft categories hydraulic actuators combine the rigid material protection for the electronic compartment and flexible peduncle to create a capable system auvs that utilized propulsive fins had better performance when the fin had some complacency like biological animals the electronics compartment for auvs tend to be rigid encasements that is water tight and made from a plastic body shells made of flexible material have become more common as this gives a more mimetic shape ichikizaki and yamamoto 2007 shen et al 2011 these shells can be made from soft or rigid materials that are selected depending on body morphology and shape that is trying to be achieved so the motion is not impeded yu et al 2016b soft actuators use elastomers for body coverage because structures need to deform for multiple cycles with low internal resistance maintain water proofing and maintain overall shape material selection in the future should consider replication of designs for machining and assembly purposes to lower cost and increase number of units produced in the future an investigation into the material lifespan of the new combination systems should be conducted 9 7 electronics electronic selection is a topic all on its own this review attempts to consolidate and give examples of motors sensors and batteries another key electrical component would be the control panels that monitor system performance perform onboard calculations and output signals depending on programming and construction control panels are the device that ties all the other electronics together as they effectively are the brain of the auv however control panels are not included in this review as they require an in depth investigation to help others optimize their robotic systems in the future the motors that are used to give mechanical power to rigid or soft actuators are completely dependent on the auvs needs the average auv is small less than 2 m so these motors tend to not be large however the large auvs like yu et al yu et al 2016b and anderson et al anderson and chhabra 2002 require a much more powerful dc motor it is possible to find waterproof actuators which can be submersed the best recommendations that can be given at this time is that sensors should be equipped to give the auv spatial awareness stability awareness internal system monitoring and environmental sampling capabilities these sensors help the auv to see obstacles infrared cameras sonar electrolocation monitor heading depth stability gps inclinometer attitude transducer pressure sensor gyroscope acceleration inertia accelerometer inertial measurement unit force torque strain gauge stress sensor electrical current water leakage voltmeter moisture sensor temperature chemical thermometer ph sensor these sensors give the auv diagnostics about spatial positioning and to take water samples while it swims this review displays the wide selection of sensors and cameras that can be applied for an array of inputs to help the auv navigate their environment these sensors and cameras have been developed into smaller scales and require less power at the moment auvs struggle to perform missions for extended periods of time murphy and haroutunian 2011 in the future the motion of these auvs could be used to power these smaller cameras and sensors by extracting the vibrational motion using energy harvesting techniques salazar et al 2018b the batteries give these electronics and the actuators their power but lifespan of these batteries is heavily dependent on usage selection of the appropriate battery to maximize swimming capability should be a priority all the electronics used require a battery that will maintain charge for long periods of time and is rechargeable that is why ni mh li ion and li polymer have been used each has advantages and disadvantages and is dependent on the users needs and budget the most customizable battery in terms of shape is the li polymer which could be applicable when compact design is required 10 conclusions auvs are continuing to be optimized to develop an autonomous vehicle so they can be used in real world applications in efforts to create more optimized auvs the kinematic physical and hydrodynamic modeling were outlined which lead to the actuator design the electronics were outlined to show the possibilities for utility and autonomy the modeling of the biological animals gave a more fundamental understanding of the capabilities and characteristics that gave criteria for the motion and size majority of this work expressed the rigid and soft actuators in their respective categories and gave representations of auvs utilizing these types of actuators the described auvs served as a good literature reviews for each category the more intriguing found auvs were the ones that include more flexibility for the fin or body actuators the combination of rigid and soft materials was proposed as biological animals have rigid and soft structures the selection of materials was assumed to be a top priority to create biomimetic auvs acknowledgments the authors a campos and v fuentes gratefully
