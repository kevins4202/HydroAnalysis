12215,revealing the status of groundwater contamination before it reaches a critical level is crucial to effective groundwater management with this in mind the research primarily aims to identify vulnerable aquifers of savar upazila sub district a highly industrialized zone of dhaka district by analyzing existing hydrological attributes through a gis based drastic model seven drastic attributes viz depth to aquifer net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of aquifer were created and integrated using a weighted overlay method in a gis interface the resultant vulnerability map reveals that about 34 of the study area is in low vulnerability zones 45 is moderately vulnerable and 21 highly vulnerable to groundwater contamination the results also reveal that aquifers contiguous to floodplain areas are highly vulnerable whereas those adjacent to terrace areas have low vulnerability the model outcomes affirm that the depth to aquifer topography and soil media had the greatest link to vulnerability a positive correlation was also noticed while validating the final drastic map between the vulnerability classes and the three groundwater quality parameters electrical conductivity nitrate and chromium concentrations though the current levels of contamination are within permissible limits the risk of further contamination cannot be ruled out and is indeed rather likely information on the current status of contamination of groundwater might act as an early warning for the responsible authorities to take prudent measures to prevent further stress on this invaluable resource graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater vulnerability drastic model gis sensitivity analysis savar upazila 1 introduction groundwater resources are becoming vulnerable to contamination due to the increasing stress of anthropogenic activities such as agriculture urbanization and industrialization dimitriou and moussoulis 2011 khan et al 2011a shirazi et al 2010 human activities commonly threaten groundwater quality leading to temporary or permanent loss of the resource and therefore incurring a significant cost for the remediation and or removal of harmful contaminants from the water prior to use the concept of groundwater vulnerability to contamination was introduced by margat 1968 in which groundwater vulnerability was defined as the opposite to natural barriers against contamination the national research council of united states of america defined groundwater vulnerability in a simplified way as the tendency or likelihood for contaminants to reach a specified position in the groundwater system after getting introduced at some location above the uppermost aquifer council 1993 in a similar vein ball et al 2004 argued that groundwater vulnerability is the tendency and likelihood of contaminants to reach the aquifer after being introduced at the ground surface groundwater vulnerability depends on the hydrogeological characteristics of an area which largely control the residence time of water that fell as rain infiltrated the soil reached the water table and flowed into the aquifer prior et al 2003 this is categorized as either intrinsic or specific vulnerability frind et al 2006 gogu and dassargues 2000 stigter et al 2006 intrinsic vulnerability is the vulnerability controlled by the geological and hydrogeological attributes of the aquifer whereas specific vulnerability is defined as the vulnerability associated with a specific source of contamination its characteristics and connection to the various components of intrinsic vulnerability gogu and dassargues 2000 vrba and zaporozec 1994 considering the aquifer characteristics researchers have adopted various methods and techniques to estimate groundwater vulnerability javadi et al 2011 all the current methods can be grouped under three major categories namely 1 process based models 2 statistical models and 3 gis overlay and index council 1993 nobre et al 2007 tesoriero et al 1998 the choice of the most appropriate method to determine vulnerability depends profoundly on the purpose and scope of a particular study scale of the task data availability and most importantly the user s time and cost liggett and talwar 2009 compared to the other two methods process based simulation models are relatively complex and involve a substantial amount of data input as well as considerable computing power almasri 2008 iqbal et al 2012 process based models are restricted to predicting physical chemical and biological processes distributing contaminants spatially and temporally and in assessing groundwater contamination in contrast statistical techniques are a simpler alternative approach for predicting groundwater contamination this method involves correlating various measured parameters with the concentration of contaminants mclay et al 2001 monitoring changes in chemical concentration over time is the major disadvantage of this method however this method is applicable in areas where the groundwater contamination is governed by similar physical factors e g hydrogeological attributes the simplest and most widely used method the gis overlay and index method in combination considers the physical factors relevant to potential contamination such as soil media geological material aquifer depth recharge rate and environmental factors aller 1985 almasri 2008 gogu and dassargues 2000 there is a growing concern in the scientific community regarding the assessment of groundwater contamination with the increasing availability of spatial data and the use of gis groundwater vulnerability mapping has become a popular tool for groundwater resource protection and management jha et al 2007 of all the available gis based mapping techniques drastic acronym depth to aquifer d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t impact of vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c is the most popular and was initially proposed by aller et al 1987a inspired by the drastic method but with a different nomenclature civita 1994 proposed the sintacs method the acronym coming from depth to the water table s net infiltration i unsaturated zone n soil media t aquifer media a hydraulic conductivity c and slope s seepage standing for system for early evaluation of pollution potential of agricultural groundwater environments is another mapping approach proposed by navulur and engel 1998 the seepage method uses depth to the water table soil topography soil depth impact of vadose zone aquifer material characteristics and attenuation potential the epik method proposed by doerfliger and zwahlen 1997 was developed for karst aquifers and includes epikarst development e protective cover potency p infiltration stipulation i and karst mesh growth k with fewer parameters than the previous approaches the god method is considered to be the quick and an easy technique for pollution mapping god initially proposed by foster 1987 stands for groundwater occurrence overall lithology of the aquifer and depth to the groundwater table all these techniques aim to assess the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifers with the main factors the depth to the aquifer water table the soil properties and the characteristics of the saturated and unsaturated areas gogu and dassargues 2000 numerous projects based on drastic method the most popular method have been undertaken in many parts of the world those in the united states rupert 2001 sweden rosen 1994 south korea kim and hamm 1999 south africa lynch et al 1997 portugal lobo ferreira and oliveira 1993 north america ducci 1999 fagnan et al 1998 fritch et al 2000 navulur and engel 1998 stark et al 1999 and china italy and algeria dai et al 2001 lobo ferreira and oliveira 1997 lynch et al 1994 menani 2001 napolitano and fabbri 1996 shahid 2000 are prominent in bangladesh groundwater research has mostly been confined to hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical aspects such as groundwater potential groundwater quality hydrogeological modeling and heavy metal pollutants zahid 2003 khan et al 2011a 2011b salam and alam 2014 zakir et al 2006 however very little has been attempted in the context of vulnerability due to urbanization and industrialization seddique and matin 2013 and jamil 2010 both targeted groundwater vulnerability assessment in two rapidly urbanized and densely populated cities narayanganj and tongi respectively however the authors did not use conventional drastic parameters in their groundwater vulnerability studies rather they considered only thickness of the upper clay depth to the water level and land use pattern haque et al 2018 on the other hand conducted a research on vulnerability of groundwater pollution from mining activities in an open pit coal mine in bangladesh to begin to bridge this research gap this study was undertaken in savar upazila in the dhaka district of bangladesh where around 1500 industries together with a major export processing zone the dhaka export processing zone depz are currently in operation among the industries chemicals ceramics leather processing and pharmaceutical textile dyeing and washing activities are the major sources of contamination about 195 brick factories are also operating in the vicinity according to the pollution categories of the department of environment of bangladesh all types of industries green orange a orange b and red are present in the study area doe 1997 this leads to the assumption that groundwater resources in the study area could be under threat from industrial effluent thus the primary aim of this study was to identify vulnerable aquifers using the gis based drastic model with the intention of providing contemporary information on groundwater contamination which could be beneficial for sustainable management of groundwater resource 2 the study area 2 1 general description savar is the second largest total area 280 km2 upazila in the dhaka district and is rapidly growing in the context of urbanization and industrialization fig 1 a geographically it is situated at the northern edge of dhaka between 23 44 n and 24 12 n latitude and between 90 11 e and 90 22 e longitude savar upazila consists of twelve unions the lowest administrative division among which the shimulia union encompasses the largest area and savar pourashava a town the smallest savar is one of the most densely populated upazilas in bangladesh with total population 1 387 426 the population density of the region is 4951 persons per km2 whereas the national population density is 1015 person per km2 bbs 2011 the study area experiences a subtropical to tropical monsoon climate characterized by heavy precipitation high temperatures and excessive humidity the temperature varies widely both diurnally and seasonally on average the annual temperature in the study area varies between a maximum of 34 5 c and a minimum of 11 5 c the average annual rainfall in the wet season is about 2000 mm with maximum rainfall 90 occurring between may to october https bmd gov bd the bangshi river the dhaleswari river a tributary of the bangshi river flowing on the southwestern side of the study area and the turag river are the major river systems in the study area fig 1a the bangshi and its southern course the dhaleswari pass along the western side and the turag along the eastern side of the study area the karanatali river a small stream flowing across the study area originates from dhaleswari near the savar purashava and runs towards the turag on the southeastern side of the study area the study area exhibits three distinct landscape morphologies terrace the madhupur tract gully and floodplain fig 1b the terrace region is predominantly composed of pleistocene clay deposits and is further divided into an upper terrace a lower terrace and a terrace slope the terrace encompasses 131 km2 about 47 of the total study area the gully region comprises only 14 of the total area and is further divided into two subcategories deep alluvial gully and shallow gully these contain predominantly eroded sediments from the terrace and adjacent floodplains the floodplain region comprises about 39 of the total study area another major unit of post pleistocene to recent alluvium and contains interstream areas backswamps depression and river bed deposits table 1 the present land use pattern reveals that savar is one of the most rapidly growing urbanized upazila in the dhaka district fig 1c around 114 km2 corresponding to about 40 of the total area is occupied by settlements including industrial zones whereas agricultural cropland areas mostly floodplains occupy about 96 km2 34 of the total area a significant portion of the study area about 56 km2 20 of the total area belongs to the flood flow zones characterized by a lower elevation than the surrounding landmass and used occasionally for agricultural practices in contrast water bodies including the major and minor rivers occupy only 5 13 km2 and open space about 1 0 5 km2 of the total area 2 2 hydrogeology previous studies and analysis of available lithologs suggest that the study area has one major aquifer system a thick sequence plio pleistocene dupi tila sand which are mostly overlain by thin to occasionally thick pleistocene madhupur clay and in few places by recent floodplain sediments viz silty clay silt and fine sand khan et al 2011b undp 1982 the hydrogeological cross section of the study area fig 2 shows that the thickness of the aquitard is greater in the central portion and smaller towards the east and west of the study area the lack of a significant aquitard is observed in the southern and north eastern parts hydrogeologically the aquifer system of the study area is semi confined to confined in nature and transmissibility of the main aquifer varies from 855 m2 day to 1259 m2 day with a storage coefficient ranging from 0 002505 to 0 013395 zahid 2003 it is quite alarming that there has been a constant decline in the groundwater level since 2005 with the average rate of declination about 0 6 m year the groundwater level is relatively higher in the northern and western parts and lower in the southeastern part of the study area due to huge water extraction in dhaka city ahmed et al 2010 the regional groundwater depth contour for the wet and dry seasons infer that there is a huge cone of depression in the southeastern side of the study area towards mirpur in dhaka city akther et al 2010 3 materials and methods 3 1 drastic modeling drastic is a gis based overlay technique to assess susceptibility to groundwater contamination this particular geospatial technique was developed in the usa by aller et al 1987a seven hydrogeological attributes constitute the acronyms of the drastic model namely 1 depth to aquifer d 2 net recharge r 3 aquifer media a 4 soil media s 5 topography t 6 impact of vadose zone i and 7 hydraulic conductivity c the drastic method adopts a delphi technique for the selection of weight values for its indicators the indicators are assigned weight values to express their relative importance to the pollution potential on a scale of 1 5 while subclasses of individual indicators are also given a rank as per their contribution to contamination for example an indicator that has a significant influence in model computation will be assigned a relative weight value of 5 while a minor contributor is assigned the relative weight value of 1 table 2 an indicator is further categorized into several sub classes range and ranked according to its specific properties for a particular study area though rank may change from one study area to another expert knowledge regarding geology and hydrogeology of an area is a prerequisite to determine the range and associated rating of the indicators the subclasses are assigned on a scale of 1 10 where the rating 1 and 10 indicates the lowest and highest potential to contamination respectively table 4 despite the fixed weight values for every indicator in model each input may be modified depending on the area of interest aller et al 1987a the final vulnerability mapping is based on the drastic index di computed as the weighted sum overlay of the seven layers using the following equation 1 v i n d e x i 1 7 w i r i where wi and ri represent weight factor and relative rating 3 1 1 data preparation and assigning weight the study followed three major steps 1 vulnerability mapping including data collection from relevant sources data preparation and model computation 2 measuring indicator efficiency by means of sensitivity analysis and 3 validation of the resultant vulnerability map fig 3 relevant databases for the present study were obtained from primary and secondary sources table 3 data were sourced either in hardcopy or soft digital format from geological survey of bangladesh gsb bangladesh water development board bwdb soil research development institute srdi institute of water modeling iwm and department of public and health engineering dphe apart from these secondary sources we collected data by means of constructing bore logs installing monitoring wells to measure the groundwater level and field checking for soil type geomorphology and land use in various locations of the study area an extensive laboratory program was conducted for grain size analysis and groundwater chemistry evaluation since the study was intended to work in the geospatial domain we extensively employed arcgis version 10 1 for spatial data analysis in addition we utilized rockworks version 15 software for bore log data management the following section describes the techniques involved in spatial data preparation and assignment of rank values to subclasses for each indicator of the drastic model information pertaining to the indicator d was obtained from bore log data a total of thirty three bore logs portrayed the subsurface lithological description and were utilized for the identification of specific depths of the aquifer in the study area once all the logs were checked and recorded for depth in each location the depth attributes were transferred to an excel spreadsheet with geographic locations for each bore log subsequently a gis based point shapefile was created to observe the spatial distribution of d inverse distance weighted idw interpolation techniques were employed in the gis environment almasri 2008 gogu and dassargues 2000 indicator d varied from 1 05 to 30 30 m and was classified into five depth ranges as 3 m 3 6 m 6 10 m 10 15 m and 15 m based on general perception higher depth poses less contamination potential and vice versa thus the subclasses of d were ranked accordingly the highest score of 9 was given to the shallowest depth of 3 m then 7 for 3 6 m 5 for 6 10 m 3 for 10 15 m and 1 for 15 m table 4 the indicator r was computed by the water table fluctuation wtf method the method estimates groundwater recharge as the product of specific yield sy and the annual rate of water level rise or fall δh including the total groundwater draft sophocleous 1991 the governing equation is given as 2 net recharge s y δ h data from five test pumps were utilized for specific yield estimation and the water table fluctuation data were estimated from 21 monitoring wells installed in and adjacent to the study area by bwdb we used continuous data from the year 2014 for all the wells from the calculation groundwater recharge values were found to vary from 223 to 437 mm year in the study area subsequently the r values were categorized into five classes as 250 mm year 250 300 mm year 300 350 mm year 350 400 mm year and 400 mm year in general the greater the recharge higher the potential for groundwater contamination therefore areas with higher recharge were assigned relatively high rating values a rating of 7 was assigned to the class 400 mm year 6 to 350 400 mm year 5 to 300 350 mm year 4 to 250 300 mm year and 3 to 250 mm year table 4 a or type of aquifer material was obtained from bore log information described above for the calculation of d mapping the spatial distribution of a followed a similar approach to the mapping of d as described above three distinct lithologies characterized the aquifers of the study area viz fine sand medium sand and coarse sand contaminant attenuation in the aquifer depends on grain size and its sorting in general the larger the grain size the higher the permeability which lowers the attenuation potential and consequently increases the potential of pollution anwar et al 2002 keeping this point in mind subclasses of indicator were ranked coarse sand was given the highest rating of 8 medium sand 6 and fine sand 4 table 4 s was obtained by digitizing existing soil texture map having a representative fraction rf of 1 50000 five soil textures were identified in the study area from the map and digitized as a polygon shapefile comprising clay clay loam sandy clay loam sandy loam and loamy sand to assign a suitable rating to each soil type various soil parameters such as soil textures thickness use water retention and conductivity were taken into account as loamy sand is least capable of preventing pollutant migration to the aquifer it was assigned a high rank of 10 while sandy loam sandy clay loam clay loam and clay were ranked 8 5 3 and 1 respectively table 4 t information was obtained from the digital elevation map dem slope in percentage was created by using spatial analyst tools in gis the area has flat landscape therefore slope percentage variation was found to be very small ranging from 0 to 12 the entire slope map was classified into five classes as 1 1 3 3 5 5 10 and 10 the steep slope allows higher runoff velocities which consequently can reduce the migration of contaminants to the aquifer in contrast water can stand longer in flat areas allowing pollutants to percolate into the aquifer easily considering this fact very flat terrain with 1 slope was given the highest rank of 10 followed by 1 3 3 5 5 10 and 10 slopes being ranked 8 6 4 and 2 respectively table 4 i was prepared from lithological information by means of similar techniques that were adopted for the indicators d and a vadose zone materials for the study area were found to be dominantly clay and silty clay their ratings were based on a comparative assessment regarding how well the given vadose zone materials would behave as an infiltrating or permeability potential medium as clay possess very low permeability it was given a low rank of 2 compared to silty clay which was ranked 3 because of its higher permeability table 4 in this study grain size properties e g cumulative weight percent coefficient of uniformity inclusive graphic standard deviation and porosity of the aquifer sediment samples were analyzed and fed into the equations of hazen 1892 and kozeny 1927 for estimation of c the empirical equations are given below 3 1 hazen k ρ g v 6 10 4 1 10 n 0 26 d 10 2 4 2 kozeny carman k ρ g v 8 3 10 3 n 3 1 n 2 d 10 2 where k hydraulic conductivity g acceleration due to gravity v kinetic viscosity n porosity d10 grain size diameter to minimize the error of calculated grain size attributes values obtained from the given equations were averaged the average estimated rate of hydraulic conductivity ranged from 12 71 to 24 68 m day idw was used for the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity in this study considering this range of hydraulic conductivity the entire study area was divided into two subclasses of 15 m day and 15 m day contamination is generally faster in an aquifer if it possesses higher hydraulic conductivity and vice versa as the c is neither very high nor very low in the study area a moderate ranking was assigned to the subclasses with 5 given for 15 m day and 6 for 15 25 m day table 4 3 2 groundwater sampling and analysis a total of 42 groundwater samples were collected from hand tube wells htw shallow tube wells stw and monitoring wells mw during january 2017 following standard protocol electrical conductivity ec was measured using a portable ec meter on spot in the field nitrate no3ˉ was determined by ion chromatography system ics and chromium cr was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 4 results as mentioned earlier the drastic model uses seven hydrogeological indicators to determine the risk of groundwater contamination i e the vulnerability to contamination the following sections describe the implications classes and spatial distributions of the indicators in the study area 4 1 individual indicators 4 1 1 depth to aquifer d d controls the time taken for the pollutants to pass through the soil media before reaching the top of the aquifer hence this indicator depends on the thickness of sediments through which infiltrating water must travel before reaching the saturated zone rahman 2008 shirazi et al 2013 for the present study d varies from about 1 m to 30 m the lower values 3 m were observed in the northwest mostly in the shimulia union and in the south bhakurta union of the study area while the higher values of 15 m were found in the southern part of the savar pourashava and the east of the amin bazar and birulia unions in the other areas small to moderate values i e 3 m 15 m were reported in terms of area coverage the five d categories 1 3 m 2 3 6 m 3 6 10 m 4 10 15 m 5 15 m were found to cover around 2 6 54 33 and 5 respectively of the total study area fig 4 a table 4 4 1 2 net recharge r r is the annual volume of water that penetrates the ground surface and reaches the aquifer edet 2014 most of the areas belong to the central portion of the study area northern part of the savar pourashava northwestern parts of the shimulia and birulia unions had the highest r 400 mm year in contrast the areas in the west of pathalia the north of ashulia the south of yearpur and the southeast of the amin bazar unions had relatively lower r 250 mm year the remaining areas in the tetuljhora banagram kaundia dhamsona unions and in half of the shimulia union fell in zones of moderate r i e 250 400 mm year of the individual r classes 1 250 mm year covers around 3 2 250 300 mm year covers around 17 3 300 350 mm year covers around 48 4 350 400 mm year covers around 25 and 5 400 mm year covers around 7 of the total study area fig 4b table 4 4 1 3 aquifer media a a determines the pore spaces and controls the flow of water within the aquifer aller et al 1987b in the study area three distinct a that characterize the aquifer system are 1 fine sand 2 medium sand and 3 coarse sand aquifers composed of medium sand cover the greatest around 86 of the total study area aquifers composed of fine sand cover around 9 a few patches in the shimulia bhakurta dhamsona and ashulia unions and aquifers composed of coarse sand cover around 5 in the south of the amin bazar union of the total study area fig 4c table 4 4 1 4 soil media s the soil constituents control the recharge potential and hence the ability of contaminants to move vertically through the vadose zone lee 2003 from the soil map it can be inferred that clay and sandy loam are the two dominant soil types in the study area covering around 37 and 36 of the total study area respectively the other soil types are clay loam sandy clay loam and loamy sand representing around 16 8 and 3 of the total study area respectively fig 4d table 4 4 1 5 topography t t encompasses slope variability and controls the runoff after heavy rainfall on the land surface overall the study area has a relatively flat topography with slopes percent ranging from 0 to 12 most of the central part of the savar pourashava birulia and pathalia unions and some parts of the shimulia and banagram unions have steeper slopes percent 10 in contrast the flood plains in the northwest of the shimulia union in the south of the bhakurta and amin bazar unions and parts of the kaundia and tetuljhora unions have very gentle slope percent 1 3 the slope percent classes 1 1 2 1 3 3 3 5 4 5 10 and 5 10 comprise around 33 58 8 0 6 and 0 4 of the study area respectively fig 4e table 4 4 1 6 impact of vadose zone i vadose zone has a great influence on movement of water into subsurface i e percolation of rainwater rahman 2008 neh et al 2015 the study area is characterized by two distinct vadose zone materials clay and silty clay of the two silty clay covers the greater area around 72 of the total and clay around 28 mostly in small patches in the northwest of the shimulia union the south of the bhakurta and banagram unions and in a few parts of the yearpur union fig 4f table 4 4 1 7 hydraulic conductivity c c is defined as the ability of aquifer materials to transmit water which in turn controls the rate of groundwater flow under a given hydraulic gradient the c of aquifers in the study area varies between 12 7 and 24 7 m day in this study c values are categorized as 15 m day in the pathalia union and savar pourashava around 19 of the total study area and 15 25 m day around 81 of the total area fig 4g table 4 4 2 drastic groundwater vulnerability map fig 5 shows the groundwater vulnerability map of the study area using drastic model the vulnerability scores obtained from the model showed a unimodal distribution from 79 to 137 an equal area interval ei was used to classify the calculated drastic scores into three vulnerability classes low 79 97 moderate 97 117 and high 117 137 the area corresponding to each vulnerability class is given in table 5 according to the final drastic map nearly half 45 the study area is classified as moderately vulnerable this area covers the northern shimulia dhamsona and yearpur unions and southern tetuljhora kaundia and amin bazar unions peripheries of the study region a small moderately vulnerable zone is also found in the central region the low vulnerability class covers the second largest area about 34 of the total area mostly in the central part of the study area birulia and ashulia unions and parts of the savar pourashava banagram and yearpur unions the highly vulnerable class is mostly in the floodplain areas in the northwest shimulia and dhamsona unions southwest bhakurta union and the south of tetuljohra union and in the extreme east and west of the central part of the study area eastern side of the yearpur ashulia and birulia unions western side of the pathalia union and a small area in savar pourashava comprising about 21 of the total area fig 5 5 sensitivity analysis and model validation 5 1 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed in order to assess the accuracy of the model and check whether all seven drastic indicators were really effective to evaluate aquifer vulnerability in the study area two approaches were utilized map removal sensitivity analysis as initially proposed by lodwick et al 1990 and single indicator sensitivity analysis as proposed by napolitano and fabbri 1996 5 1 1 map removal sensitivity analysis the governing equation of the map removal sensitivity analysis is given below 5 s v n v n v 100 where s is the sensitivity measure v and v are the unperturbed and the perturbed vulnerability indices respectively and n and n are the number of data layers used to compute v and v the unperturbed vulnerability index is the actual index obtained by using all seven indicators while the perturbed vulnerability index used the lower number of indicators during computation processing the analysis shows a clear variation in vulnerability index table 6 as a consequence of removing a single indicator at a time the removal of d indicator shows the greatest variation maximum variation is 2 25 in the aquifer vulnerability index this could be attributed to the contrast between the theoretical weight assigned to this layer and the fact that most of the areas in savar characteristically have a lower depth to aquifer value the vulnerability index seems to be less sensitive to the removal of t 1 81 and s 1 29 layers in comparison to the d layer these two indicators are considered theoretically less important weights 1 and 2 respectively as well the sensitivity to these indicators t and s signifies that the flatness and soil texture loamy soil amplify the potential of contamination in the study area removal of the impact of the vadose zone layer also caused considerable variation in the vulnerability index 1 09 significant variation of the aquifer vulnerability index has also been observed due the removal of the c and r layers with mean variation indices of 0 87 and 0 52 respectively the a layer was the least sensitive of all the seven drastic indicators and its mean variation index was 0 34 the next step was to remove one or more indicators for index calculation and the detailed statistics are given in table 7 for executing this section indicators making a lower contribution to the vulnerability index were removed in the first instance subsequently the other indicators i e those having greater contribution were unaltered an increasing trend in the variation index is logical when removing more indicators according to prior relevant research however the current study found the opposite for example removal of four indicators e g a r c and i caused greater variation in the vulnerability index than removal of five indicators e g a r c i and s with comparative results of 2 2 and 1 19 respectively there is no clear explanation for this small anomaly however it could be attributed to internal variation of a particular indicator the weights assigned to indicators and their imperfect representation of the real world babiker et al 2005 5 1 2 single indicator sensitivity analysis single indicator sensitivity analysis estimates the comparison of theoretical weights assigned to each indicator while computing the drastic model to their effective weight effective weight is inferred from the contribution of a single indicator with respect to the weight values of the other six indicators while all these attributes were processed for the vulnerability index calculation babiker et al 2005 the governing equation of the single indicator sensitivity analysis is given below 6 w pr pw v 100 where v is the vulnerability index and pr pw and w are rate weight and effective weight of the indicators respectively the statistics pertaining to single indicator sensitivity analysis are given in table 8 this study identified four indicators that showed higher effective weights than their respective theoretical weights the mean effective weights of these indicators namely d r c and t are 26 7 19 1 16 1 and 7 7 respectively which are slightly higher than their corresponding theoretical weights of 21 7 17 3 13 0 and 4 3 respectively in contrast none of the other indicators contributed higher effective weight values than their respective theoretical weights this particular sensitivity analysis infers that d r c and t are the significant contributors to vulnerability assessment using the drastic model 5 2 model validation validation of a model is essential and obligatory for further use of its outcomes in the context of the present study water chemistry data dissolved chemical constituents were employed to validate the drastic based vulnerable aquifers by means of correlation statistics srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 moratalla et al 2011 jamrah et al 2008 herlinger and viero 2007 bazimenyera and zhonghua 2008 validation using only one chemical parameter is not a legitimate way to prove that a certain aquifer is vulnerable owing to the fact that the level of an individual indicator is subject to its exposure to a particular contaminant hamza et al 2015 therefore in this study attempts were made to validate the model outcome with multiple possible chemical contaminants for the validation purpose we employed correlation techniques using three groundwater parameters namely electrical conductivity ec nitrate no3ˉ and chromium cr these three chemical parameters were expected to reveal the contamination status of the groundwater system as mentioned earlier forty two 42 groundwater samples were collected from different locations which were used for the validation purpose in this study after overlying with the vulnerability map fifteen 15 samples fell in the least vulnerable zone twenty 20 in the moderately vulnerable zone and the remaining seven 7 samples in the highest vulnerability zone fig 6 the ec in the groundwater samples ranges from 140 to 1030 μs cm a near strong positive pearson correlation r 0 42 between ec and drastic vulnerability classes fig 7 a revealed that ec is low 500 μs cm in low vulnerable zones and vice versa the increasing trend of groundwater ec 750 μs cm in high vulnerability zones is suggestive of groundwater contamination by waste water from industries which are usually high in tds the spatial distribution of ec having high values in high vulnerability areas on the groundwater vulnerability map fig 6a supports this observation as well naturally nitrate no3ˉ occurs in very low concentrations in groundwater and its increasing trend is indicative of contamination from sewage and nitrogen bearing fertilizers used in agriculture though no3ˉ in the groundwater samples are low in concentrations ranging from 0 02 to 5 55 mg l mostly 1 mg l throughout the study area a positive value of pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 19 fig 7b and relatively higher concentration of nitrate in the high vulnerability zones on the groundwater vulnerability map fig 6b also validate the model outcome chromium cr in groundwater is commonly introduced through human activities such as mining use of chemicals in industry and agricultural in the recent past numerous industries mostly dying tanneries and other chemical factories were built in the study area lacking proper effluent management systems the measured cr concentrations of the samples ranging from 3 5 to 35 μg l are within permissible limits of the who guideline value of 50 μg l nevertheless a positive correction r 0 24 fig 7c with vulnerable classes and an increasing trend of cr concentration in groundwater of the moderate to highly vulnerable areas fig 6c further validates the model outcome 6 discussion and conclusions this study is one of the initial and comprehensive efforts to identify the aquifers in bangladesh that are at risk of acute contamination from industrial effluent savar a densely populated and rapidly growing industrial hub in bangladesh was selected for a case study it is obvious that assessment of groundwater vulnerability to pollution is vital in facilitating sustainable groundwater resource management wang et al 2012 in this context the drastic method is considered to be an easy and comprehensive tool for assessing groundwater vulnerability at a specific site by means of spatial integration of various thematic layers in the gis interface this particular approach considers both geological and hydrogeological attributes controlling factors of aquifer contamination in assessing groundwater vulnerability in this study we have deployed the original drastic model originally proposed by aller et al 1985 without modifying any of its indicators other researchers have modified the original method either adding or removing indicators hao et al 2017 li et al 2017 singh et al 2015 complex morphological structures aquifer heterogeneity undefined sources of pollution were given as possible reasons for the modifications wang et al 2012 the scale of the study and the availability of spatial and non spatial attributes may also encourage researchers to modify the drastic model to obtain better model outcomes singh et al 2015 wu et al 2016 we have tried to keep the data as simple as possible not modifying any of the original drastic parameters so that the results can be easily used by stakeholders mimi and assi 2009 according to nguyet and goldscheider 2006 models including data and procedures should be simple enough that they can be used for raising awareness and mitigation programs the drastic groundwater vulnerability map of the study area fig 5 reveals significant variation in the index values in areas with different morphological geological and hydrogeological characteristics this finding is similar to the corresponding studies in other parts of the world ckakraborty et al 2007 rahman 2008 srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 the vulnerability map reveals that the floodplains with shallow aquifer depths have the highest vulnerability indexes whereas the upland areas with thick clay cover 15 m have the lowest vulnerability indexes the high vulnerability reported by ckakraborty et al 2007 and rahman 2008 of aquifers in similar geomorphic settings also confirms that the occurrence of aquifers at shallow depths in flat topography and with unconsolidated sediments sand and silt in the vadose zone enhances their susceptibility to contamination nonetheless it is worth mentioning that the vulnerability index classes are relative in the sense that sites with low vulnerability are not entirely safe from the threat of groundwater contamination just less susceptible than highly vulnerable sites sensitivity analyses of the groundwater vulnerability map in the study area show that among the drastic indicators the most crucial for determining the vulnerability index for the present study appears to be d t and s the areas with high vulnerability index have aquifers at shallower depths 3 6 m flat topography slope percent 1 and sandy loam soil texture low vulnerable areas are characterized by greater depths of the aquifers 10 m terrain slope percept 5 and clayey soil texture similar studies by bojórquez tapia et al 2009 and saidi et al 2011 also identified d as the most influential indicator while t was considered significant in the study by mohammadi et al 2009 however very limited studies such as babiker et al 2005 mohammadi et al 2009 and kabera and zhaohui 2008 found s as a vital indicator although not the first ranked in vulnerability assessment it is very unlikely that the relative influence of an individual indicator would be always the same for all areas because the importance of a single indicator depends on the ranking of the other indicators as well as on the general characteristics of the study site gogu and dassargues 2000 napolitano and fabbri 1996 the validation of the model using nitrate no3 is common because of its nonexistence very low presence in groundwater under normal conditions hamza et al 2015 shirazi et al 2012 a number of studies al adamat et al 2003 baalousha 2011 boughriba et al 2010 prasad et al 2011 secunda et al 1998 sener et al 2009 yin et al 2013 have adopted no3 as an effective validation method other studies such as herlinger and viero 2007 jamrah et al 2008 moratalla et al 2011 and srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 have suggested that chemicals other than nitrate should be used to quantify groundwater vulnerability we have used chemical indicators electrical conductivity ec chromium cr and nitrate no3 to determine the accuracy of the groundwater vulnerability map of the study area a positive correlation however weak of electrical conductivity ec chromium cr and nitrate no3 concentration with the drastic index of this study suggests an increasing trend in the concentration of these constituents though the aquifers in savar are still safe in terms of pollution but increasing trend of these parameters signifies that groundwater in the study area is under threat of pollution over the course of time the drastic method has a number of advantages over other methods and few drawbacks as well hamza et al 2007 for instance in data scarce research it is difficult to scrutinize lithology which is needed for the assessment of aquifer media soil media vadose zone if bore log information is limited lack of subsurface information may also lead to general or vague permeability estimates in a highly heterogeneous aquifer similarly it is unrealistic to expect a meaningful drastic map from a few data over a large area the usefulness of the drastic method depends largely on the available information i e density of the data and map scale aller et al 1985 evans and myers 1990 kim and hamm 1999 leone et al 2009 rahman 2008 thirumalaivasan et al 2003 in addition the drastic index is highly sensitive to the scores weights and the numerical values assigned to each indicator during model computation as is evident from the literature potential groundwater recharge from rivers and standing water bodies has not yet been considered in the development of the vulnerability index al adamat et al 2003 baalousha 2011 boughriba et al 2010 prasad et al 2011 secunda et al 1998 sener et al 2009 yin et al 2013 this must be considered as a weakness in the application of the drastic method a major drawback of vulnerability mapping is the difficulty in validation andreo et al 2006 it should be noted that a significant concentration of a specific pollutant in certain zones cannot be used as a robust calibration tool for drastic results rather it depends on the existing land use patterns spatial extent and location of the potential contamination sources and their seasonal and temporal variations wang et al 2012 despite the fact the present study selected and processed the precise thematic layers for the drastic model there were still some limitations since the study area is relatively large in size 280 km2 the non availability of densely spaced values for the drastic indicators was the main hindrance in obtaining a high resolution vulnerability map keeping the limitations of the present study in mind it may be concluded that the groundwater vulnerability map of the study area can be effective in providing broad scale information on the susceptible areas of groundwater contamination even though the overall groundwater quality in the study area was found to be good the increasing trend in certain water quality parameters particularly in the highly and moderately vulnerable zones is indicative of the introduction of pollutants from anthropogenic sources and therefore the groundwater resources are under the potential risk of contamination in the near future periodic monitoring of groundwater quality in the high and moderate vulnerable zones is essential for early detection and to prevent further deterioration of the groundwater resources acknowledgments the authors are thankful to the ministry of science and

12215,revealing the status of groundwater contamination before it reaches a critical level is crucial to effective groundwater management with this in mind the research primarily aims to identify vulnerable aquifers of savar upazila sub district a highly industrialized zone of dhaka district by analyzing existing hydrological attributes through a gis based drastic model seven drastic attributes viz depth to aquifer net recharge aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and hydraulic conductivity of aquifer were created and integrated using a weighted overlay method in a gis interface the resultant vulnerability map reveals that about 34 of the study area is in low vulnerability zones 45 is moderately vulnerable and 21 highly vulnerable to groundwater contamination the results also reveal that aquifers contiguous to floodplain areas are highly vulnerable whereas those adjacent to terrace areas have low vulnerability the model outcomes affirm that the depth to aquifer topography and soil media had the greatest link to vulnerability a positive correlation was also noticed while validating the final drastic map between the vulnerability classes and the three groundwater quality parameters electrical conductivity nitrate and chromium concentrations though the current levels of contamination are within permissible limits the risk of further contamination cannot be ruled out and is indeed rather likely information on the current status of contamination of groundwater might act as an early warning for the responsible authorities to take prudent measures to prevent further stress on this invaluable resource graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater vulnerability drastic model gis sensitivity analysis savar upazila 1 introduction groundwater resources are becoming vulnerable to contamination due to the increasing stress of anthropogenic activities such as agriculture urbanization and industrialization dimitriou and moussoulis 2011 khan et al 2011a shirazi et al 2010 human activities commonly threaten groundwater quality leading to temporary or permanent loss of the resource and therefore incurring a significant cost for the remediation and or removal of harmful contaminants from the water prior to use the concept of groundwater vulnerability to contamination was introduced by margat 1968 in which groundwater vulnerability was defined as the opposite to natural barriers against contamination the national research council of united states of america defined groundwater vulnerability in a simplified way as the tendency or likelihood for contaminants to reach a specified position in the groundwater system after getting introduced at some location above the uppermost aquifer council 1993 in a similar vein ball et al 2004 argued that groundwater vulnerability is the tendency and likelihood of contaminants to reach the aquifer after being introduced at the ground surface groundwater vulnerability depends on the hydrogeological characteristics of an area which largely control the residence time of water that fell as rain infiltrated the soil reached the water table and flowed into the aquifer prior et al 2003 this is categorized as either intrinsic or specific vulnerability frind et al 2006 gogu and dassargues 2000 stigter et al 2006 intrinsic vulnerability is the vulnerability controlled by the geological and hydrogeological attributes of the aquifer whereas specific vulnerability is defined as the vulnerability associated with a specific source of contamination its characteristics and connection to the various components of intrinsic vulnerability gogu and dassargues 2000 vrba and zaporozec 1994 considering the aquifer characteristics researchers have adopted various methods and techniques to estimate groundwater vulnerability javadi et al 2011 all the current methods can be grouped under three major categories namely 1 process based models 2 statistical models and 3 gis overlay and index council 1993 nobre et al 2007 tesoriero et al 1998 the choice of the most appropriate method to determine vulnerability depends profoundly on the purpose and scope of a particular study scale of the task data availability and most importantly the user s time and cost liggett and talwar 2009 compared to the other two methods process based simulation models are relatively complex and involve a substantial amount of data input as well as considerable computing power almasri 2008 iqbal et al 2012 process based models are restricted to predicting physical chemical and biological processes distributing contaminants spatially and temporally and in assessing groundwater contamination in contrast statistical techniques are a simpler alternative approach for predicting groundwater contamination this method involves correlating various measured parameters with the concentration of contaminants mclay et al 2001 monitoring changes in chemical concentration over time is the major disadvantage of this method however this method is applicable in areas where the groundwater contamination is governed by similar physical factors e g hydrogeological attributes the simplest and most widely used method the gis overlay and index method in combination considers the physical factors relevant to potential contamination such as soil media geological material aquifer depth recharge rate and environmental factors aller 1985 almasri 2008 gogu and dassargues 2000 there is a growing concern in the scientific community regarding the assessment of groundwater contamination with the increasing availability of spatial data and the use of gis groundwater vulnerability mapping has become a popular tool for groundwater resource protection and management jha et al 2007 of all the available gis based mapping techniques drastic acronym depth to aquifer d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography t impact of vadose zone i and hydraulic conductivity c is the most popular and was initially proposed by aller et al 1987a inspired by the drastic method but with a different nomenclature civita 1994 proposed the sintacs method the acronym coming from depth to the water table s net infiltration i unsaturated zone n soil media t aquifer media a hydraulic conductivity c and slope s seepage standing for system for early evaluation of pollution potential of agricultural groundwater environments is another mapping approach proposed by navulur and engel 1998 the seepage method uses depth to the water table soil topography soil depth impact of vadose zone aquifer material characteristics and attenuation potential the epik method proposed by doerfliger and zwahlen 1997 was developed for karst aquifers and includes epikarst development e protective cover potency p infiltration stipulation i and karst mesh growth k with fewer parameters than the previous approaches the god method is considered to be the quick and an easy technique for pollution mapping god initially proposed by foster 1987 stands for groundwater occurrence overall lithology of the aquifer and depth to the groundwater table all these techniques aim to assess the intrinsic vulnerability of aquifers with the main factors the depth to the aquifer water table the soil properties and the characteristics of the saturated and unsaturated areas gogu and dassargues 2000 numerous projects based on drastic method the most popular method have been undertaken in many parts of the world those in the united states rupert 2001 sweden rosen 1994 south korea kim and hamm 1999 south africa lynch et al 1997 portugal lobo ferreira and oliveira 1993 north america ducci 1999 fagnan et al 1998 fritch et al 2000 navulur and engel 1998 stark et al 1999 and china italy and algeria dai et al 2001 lobo ferreira and oliveira 1997 lynch et al 1994 menani 2001 napolitano and fabbri 1996 shahid 2000 are prominent in bangladesh groundwater research has mostly been confined to hydrogeological and hydrogeochemical aspects such as groundwater potential groundwater quality hydrogeological modeling and heavy metal pollutants zahid 2003 khan et al 2011a 2011b salam and alam 2014 zakir et al 2006 however very little has been attempted in the context of vulnerability due to urbanization and industrialization seddique and matin 2013 and jamil 2010 both targeted groundwater vulnerability assessment in two rapidly urbanized and densely populated cities narayanganj and tongi respectively however the authors did not use conventional drastic parameters in their groundwater vulnerability studies rather they considered only thickness of the upper clay depth to the water level and land use pattern haque et al 2018 on the other hand conducted a research on vulnerability of groundwater pollution from mining activities in an open pit coal mine in bangladesh to begin to bridge this research gap this study was undertaken in savar upazila in the dhaka district of bangladesh where around 1500 industries together with a major export processing zone the dhaka export processing zone depz are currently in operation among the industries chemicals ceramics leather processing and pharmaceutical textile dyeing and washing activities are the major sources of contamination about 195 brick factories are also operating in the vicinity according to the pollution categories of the department of environment of bangladesh all types of industries green orange a orange b and red are present in the study area doe 1997 this leads to the assumption that groundwater resources in the study area could be under threat from industrial effluent thus the primary aim of this study was to identify vulnerable aquifers using the gis based drastic model with the intention of providing contemporary information on groundwater contamination which could be beneficial for sustainable management of groundwater resource 2 the study area 2 1 general description savar is the second largest total area 280 km2 upazila in the dhaka district and is rapidly growing in the context of urbanization and industrialization fig 1 a geographically it is situated at the northern edge of dhaka between 23 44 n and 24 12 n latitude and between 90 11 e and 90 22 e longitude savar upazila consists of twelve unions the lowest administrative division among which the shimulia union encompasses the largest area and savar pourashava a town the smallest savar is one of the most densely populated upazilas in bangladesh with total population 1 387 426 the population density of the region is 4951 persons per km2 whereas the national population density is 1015 person per km2 bbs 2011 the study area experiences a subtropical to tropical monsoon climate characterized by heavy precipitation high temperatures and excessive humidity the temperature varies widely both diurnally and seasonally on average the annual temperature in the study area varies between a maximum of 34 5 c and a minimum of 11 5 c the average annual rainfall in the wet season is about 2000 mm with maximum rainfall 90 occurring between may to october https bmd gov bd the bangshi river the dhaleswari river a tributary of the bangshi river flowing on the southwestern side of the study area and the turag river are the major river systems in the study area fig 1a the bangshi and its southern course the dhaleswari pass along the western side and the turag along the eastern side of the study area the karanatali river a small stream flowing across the study area originates from dhaleswari near the savar purashava and runs towards the turag on the southeastern side of the study area the study area exhibits three distinct landscape morphologies terrace the madhupur tract gully and floodplain fig 1b the terrace region is predominantly composed of pleistocene clay deposits and is further divided into an upper terrace a lower terrace and a terrace slope the terrace encompasses 131 km2 about 47 of the total study area the gully region comprises only 14 of the total area and is further divided into two subcategories deep alluvial gully and shallow gully these contain predominantly eroded sediments from the terrace and adjacent floodplains the floodplain region comprises about 39 of the total study area another major unit of post pleistocene to recent alluvium and contains interstream areas backswamps depression and river bed deposits table 1 the present land use pattern reveals that savar is one of the most rapidly growing urbanized upazila in the dhaka district fig 1c around 114 km2 corresponding to about 40 of the total area is occupied by settlements including industrial zones whereas agricultural cropland areas mostly floodplains occupy about 96 km2 34 of the total area a significant portion of the study area about 56 km2 20 of the total area belongs to the flood flow zones characterized by a lower elevation than the surrounding landmass and used occasionally for agricultural practices in contrast water bodies including the major and minor rivers occupy only 5 13 km2 and open space about 1 0 5 km2 of the total area 2 2 hydrogeology previous studies and analysis of available lithologs suggest that the study area has one major aquifer system a thick sequence plio pleistocene dupi tila sand which are mostly overlain by thin to occasionally thick pleistocene madhupur clay and in few places by recent floodplain sediments viz silty clay silt and fine sand khan et al 2011b undp 1982 the hydrogeological cross section of the study area fig 2 shows that the thickness of the aquitard is greater in the central portion and smaller towards the east and west of the study area the lack of a significant aquitard is observed in the southern and north eastern parts hydrogeologically the aquifer system of the study area is semi confined to confined in nature and transmissibility of the main aquifer varies from 855 m2 day to 1259 m2 day with a storage coefficient ranging from 0 002505 to 0 013395 zahid 2003 it is quite alarming that there has been a constant decline in the groundwater level since 2005 with the average rate of declination about 0 6 m year the groundwater level is relatively higher in the northern and western parts and lower in the southeastern part of the study area due to huge water extraction in dhaka city ahmed et al 2010 the regional groundwater depth contour for the wet and dry seasons infer that there is a huge cone of depression in the southeastern side of the study area towards mirpur in dhaka city akther et al 2010 3 materials and methods 3 1 drastic modeling drastic is a gis based overlay technique to assess susceptibility to groundwater contamination this particular geospatial technique was developed in the usa by aller et al 1987a seven hydrogeological attributes constitute the acronyms of the drastic model namely 1 depth to aquifer d 2 net recharge r 3 aquifer media a 4 soil media s 5 topography t 6 impact of vadose zone i and 7 hydraulic conductivity c the drastic method adopts a delphi technique for the selection of weight values for its indicators the indicators are assigned weight values to express their relative importance to the pollution potential on a scale of 1 5 while subclasses of individual indicators are also given a rank as per their contribution to contamination for example an indicator that has a significant influence in model computation will be assigned a relative weight value of 5 while a minor contributor is assigned the relative weight value of 1 table 2 an indicator is further categorized into several sub classes range and ranked according to its specific properties for a particular study area though rank may change from one study area to another expert knowledge regarding geology and hydrogeology of an area is a prerequisite to determine the range and associated rating of the indicators the subclasses are assigned on a scale of 1 10 where the rating 1 and 10 indicates the lowest and highest potential to contamination respectively table 4 despite the fixed weight values for every indicator in model each input may be modified depending on the area of interest aller et al 1987a the final vulnerability mapping is based on the drastic index di computed as the weighted sum overlay of the seven layers using the following equation 1 v i n d e x i 1 7 w i r i where wi and ri represent weight factor and relative rating 3 1 1 data preparation and assigning weight the study followed three major steps 1 vulnerability mapping including data collection from relevant sources data preparation and model computation 2 measuring indicator efficiency by means of sensitivity analysis and 3 validation of the resultant vulnerability map fig 3 relevant databases for the present study were obtained from primary and secondary sources table 3 data were sourced either in hardcopy or soft digital format from geological survey of bangladesh gsb bangladesh water development board bwdb soil research development institute srdi institute of water modeling iwm and department of public and health engineering dphe apart from these secondary sources we collected data by means of constructing bore logs installing monitoring wells to measure the groundwater level and field checking for soil type geomorphology and land use in various locations of the study area an extensive laboratory program was conducted for grain size analysis and groundwater chemistry evaluation since the study was intended to work in the geospatial domain we extensively employed arcgis version 10 1 for spatial data analysis in addition we utilized rockworks version 15 software for bore log data management the following section describes the techniques involved in spatial data preparation and assignment of rank values to subclasses for each indicator of the drastic model information pertaining to the indicator d was obtained from bore log data a total of thirty three bore logs portrayed the subsurface lithological description and were utilized for the identification of specific depths of the aquifer in the study area once all the logs were checked and recorded for depth in each location the depth attributes were transferred to an excel spreadsheet with geographic locations for each bore log subsequently a gis based point shapefile was created to observe the spatial distribution of d inverse distance weighted idw interpolation techniques were employed in the gis environment almasri 2008 gogu and dassargues 2000 indicator d varied from 1 05 to 30 30 m and was classified into five depth ranges as 3 m 3 6 m 6 10 m 10 15 m and 15 m based on general perception higher depth poses less contamination potential and vice versa thus the subclasses of d were ranked accordingly the highest score of 9 was given to the shallowest depth of 3 m then 7 for 3 6 m 5 for 6 10 m 3 for 10 15 m and 1 for 15 m table 4 the indicator r was computed by the water table fluctuation wtf method the method estimates groundwater recharge as the product of specific yield sy and the annual rate of water level rise or fall δh including the total groundwater draft sophocleous 1991 the governing equation is given as 2 net recharge s y δ h data from five test pumps were utilized for specific yield estimation and the water table fluctuation data were estimated from 21 monitoring wells installed in and adjacent to the study area by bwdb we used continuous data from the year 2014 for all the wells from the calculation groundwater recharge values were found to vary from 223 to 437 mm year in the study area subsequently the r values were categorized into five classes as 250 mm year 250 300 mm year 300 350 mm year 350 400 mm year and 400 mm year in general the greater the recharge higher the potential for groundwater contamination therefore areas with higher recharge were assigned relatively high rating values a rating of 7 was assigned to the class 400 mm year 6 to 350 400 mm year 5 to 300 350 mm year 4 to 250 300 mm year and 3 to 250 mm year table 4 a or type of aquifer material was obtained from bore log information described above for the calculation of d mapping the spatial distribution of a followed a similar approach to the mapping of d as described above three distinct lithologies characterized the aquifers of the study area viz fine sand medium sand and coarse sand contaminant attenuation in the aquifer depends on grain size and its sorting in general the larger the grain size the higher the permeability which lowers the attenuation potential and consequently increases the potential of pollution anwar et al 2002 keeping this point in mind subclasses of indicator were ranked coarse sand was given the highest rating of 8 medium sand 6 and fine sand 4 table 4 s was obtained by digitizing existing soil texture map having a representative fraction rf of 1 50000 five soil textures were identified in the study area from the map and digitized as a polygon shapefile comprising clay clay loam sandy clay loam sandy loam and loamy sand to assign a suitable rating to each soil type various soil parameters such as soil textures thickness use water retention and conductivity were taken into account as loamy sand is least capable of preventing pollutant migration to the aquifer it was assigned a high rank of 10 while sandy loam sandy clay loam clay loam and clay were ranked 8 5 3 and 1 respectively table 4 t information was obtained from the digital elevation map dem slope in percentage was created by using spatial analyst tools in gis the area has flat landscape therefore slope percentage variation was found to be very small ranging from 0 to 12 the entire slope map was classified into five classes as 1 1 3 3 5 5 10 and 10 the steep slope allows higher runoff velocities which consequently can reduce the migration of contaminants to the aquifer in contrast water can stand longer in flat areas allowing pollutants to percolate into the aquifer easily considering this fact very flat terrain with 1 slope was given the highest rank of 10 followed by 1 3 3 5 5 10 and 10 slopes being ranked 8 6 4 and 2 respectively table 4 i was prepared from lithological information by means of similar techniques that were adopted for the indicators d and a vadose zone materials for the study area were found to be dominantly clay and silty clay their ratings were based on a comparative assessment regarding how well the given vadose zone materials would behave as an infiltrating or permeability potential medium as clay possess very low permeability it was given a low rank of 2 compared to silty clay which was ranked 3 because of its higher permeability table 4 in this study grain size properties e g cumulative weight percent coefficient of uniformity inclusive graphic standard deviation and porosity of the aquifer sediment samples were analyzed and fed into the equations of hazen 1892 and kozeny 1927 for estimation of c the empirical equations are given below 3 1 hazen k ρ g v 6 10 4 1 10 n 0 26 d 10 2 4 2 kozeny carman k ρ g v 8 3 10 3 n 3 1 n 2 d 10 2 where k hydraulic conductivity g acceleration due to gravity v kinetic viscosity n porosity d10 grain size diameter to minimize the error of calculated grain size attributes values obtained from the given equations were averaged the average estimated rate of hydraulic conductivity ranged from 12 71 to 24 68 m day idw was used for the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity in this study considering this range of hydraulic conductivity the entire study area was divided into two subclasses of 15 m day and 15 m day contamination is generally faster in an aquifer if it possesses higher hydraulic conductivity and vice versa as the c is neither very high nor very low in the study area a moderate ranking was assigned to the subclasses with 5 given for 15 m day and 6 for 15 25 m day table 4 3 2 groundwater sampling and analysis a total of 42 groundwater samples were collected from hand tube wells htw shallow tube wells stw and monitoring wells mw during january 2017 following standard protocol electrical conductivity ec was measured using a portable ec meter on spot in the field nitrate no3ˉ was determined by ion chromatography system ics and chromium cr was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms 4 results as mentioned earlier the drastic model uses seven hydrogeological indicators to determine the risk of groundwater contamination i e the vulnerability to contamination the following sections describe the implications classes and spatial distributions of the indicators in the study area 4 1 individual indicators 4 1 1 depth to aquifer d d controls the time taken for the pollutants to pass through the soil media before reaching the top of the aquifer hence this indicator depends on the thickness of sediments through which infiltrating water must travel before reaching the saturated zone rahman 2008 shirazi et al 2013 for the present study d varies from about 1 m to 30 m the lower values 3 m were observed in the northwest mostly in the shimulia union and in the south bhakurta union of the study area while the higher values of 15 m were found in the southern part of the savar pourashava and the east of the amin bazar and birulia unions in the other areas small to moderate values i e 3 m 15 m were reported in terms of area coverage the five d categories 1 3 m 2 3 6 m 3 6 10 m 4 10 15 m 5 15 m were found to cover around 2 6 54 33 and 5 respectively of the total study area fig 4 a table 4 4 1 2 net recharge r r is the annual volume of water that penetrates the ground surface and reaches the aquifer edet 2014 most of the areas belong to the central portion of the study area northern part of the savar pourashava northwestern parts of the shimulia and birulia unions had the highest r 400 mm year in contrast the areas in the west of pathalia the

350 400 mm year covers around 25 and 5 400 mm year covers around 7 of the total study area fig 4b table 4 4 1 3 aquifer media a a determines the pore spaces and controls the flow of water within the aquifer aller et al 1987b in the study area three distinct a that characterize the aquifer system are 1 fine sand 2 medium sand and 3 coarse sand aquifers composed of medium sand cover the greatest around 86 of the total study area aquifers composed of fine sand cover around 9 a few patches in the shimulia bhakurta dhamsona and ashulia unions and aquifers composed of coarse sand cover around 5 in the south of the amin bazar union of the total study area fig 4c table 4 4 1 4 soil media s the soil constituents control the recharge potential and hence the ability of contaminants to move vertically through the vadose zone lee 2003 from the soil map it can be inferred that clay and sandy loam are the two dominant soil types in the study area covering around 37 and 36 of the total study area respectively the other soil types are clay loam sandy clay loam and loamy sand representing around 16 8 and 3 of the total study area respectively fig 4d table 4 4 1 5 topography t t encompasses slope variability and controls the runoff after heavy rainfall on the land surface overall the study area has a relatively flat topography with slopes percent ranging from 0 to 12 most of the central

conductivity c c is defined as the ability of aquifer materials to transmit water which in turn controls the rate of groundwater flow under a given hydraulic gradient the c of aquifers in the study area varies between 12 7 and 24 7 m day in this study c values are categorized as 15 m day in the pathalia union and savar pourashava around 19 of the total study area and 15 25 m day around 81 of the total area fig 4g table 4 4 2 drastic groundwater vulnerability map fig 5 shows the groundwater vulnerability map of the study area using drastic model the vulnerability scores obtained from the model showed a unimodal distribution from 79 to 137 an equal area interval ei was used to classify the calculated drastic scores into three vulnerability classes low 79 97 moderate 97 117 and high 117 137 the area corresponding to each vulnerability class is given in table 5 according to the final drastic map nearly half 45 the study area is classified as moderately vulnerable this area covers the northern shimulia dhamsona and yearpur unions and southern tetuljhora kaundia and amin bazar unions peripheries of the study region a small moderately vulnerable zone is also found in the central region the low vulnerability class covers the second largest area about 34 of the total area mostly in the central part of the study area birulia and ashulia unions and parts of the savar pourashava banagram and yearpur unions the highly vulnerable class is mostly in the floodplain areas in the northwest shimulia and dhamsona unions southwest bhakurta union and the south of tetuljohra union and in the extreme east and west of the central part of the study area eastern side of the yearpur ashulia and birulia unions western side of the pathalia union and a small area in savar pourashava comprising about 21 of the total area fig 5 5 sensitivity analysis and model validation 5 1 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis was performed in order to assess the accuracy of the model and check whether all seven drastic indicators were really effective to evaluate aquifer vulnerability in the study area two approaches were utilized map removal sensitivity analysis as initially proposed by lodwick et al 1990 and single indicator sensitivity analysis as proposed by napolitano and fabbri 1996 5 1 1 map removal sensitivity analysis the governing equation of the map removal sensitivity analysis is given below 5 s v n v n v 100 where s is the sensitivity measure v and v are the unperturbed and the perturbed vulnerability indices respectively and n and n are the number of data layers used to compute v and v the unperturbed vulnerability index is the actual index obtained by using all seven indicators while the perturbed vulnerability index used the lower number of indicators during computation processing the analysis shows a clear variation in vulnerability index table 6 as a consequence of removing a single indicator at a time the removal of d indicator shows the greatest variation maximum variation is 2 25 in the aquifer vulnerability index this could be attributed to the contrast between the theoretical weight assigned to this layer and the fact that most of the areas in savar characteristically have a lower depth to aquifer value the vulnerability index seems to be less sensitive to the removal of t 1 81 and s 1 29 layers in comparison to the d layer these two indicators are considered theoretically less important weights 1 and 2 respectively as well the sensitivity to these indicators t and s signifies that the flatness and soil texture loamy soil amplify the potential of contamination in the study area removal of the impact of the vadose zone layer also caused considerable variation in the vulnerability index 1 09 significant variation of the aquifer vulnerability index has also been observed due the removal of the c and r layers with mean variation indices of 0 87 and 0 52 respectively the a layer was the least sensitive of all the seven drastic indicators and its mean variation index was 0 34 the next step was to remove one or more indicators for index calculation and the detailed statistics are given in table 7 for executing this section indicators making a lower contribution to the vulnerability index were removed in the first instance subsequently the other indicators i e those having greater contribution were unaltered an increasing trend in the variation index is logical when removing more indicators according to prior relevant research however the current study found the opposite for example removal of four indicators e g a r c and i caused greater variation in the vulnerability index than removal of five indicators e g a r c i and s with comparative results of 2 2 and 1 19 respectively there is no clear explanation for this small anomaly however it could be attributed to internal variation of a particular indicator the weights assigned to indicators and their imperfect representation of the real world babiker et al 2005 5 1 2 single indicator sensitivity analysis single indicator sensitivity analysis estimates the comparison of theoretical weights assigned to each indicator while computing the drastic model to their effective weight effective weight is inferred from the contribution of a single indicator with respect to the weight values of the other six indicators while all these attributes were processed for the vulnerability index calculation babiker et al 2005 the governing equation of the single indicator sensitivity analysis is given below 6 w pr pw v 100 where v is the vulnerability index and pr pw and w are rate weight and effective weight of the indicators respectively the statistics pertaining to single indicator sensitivity analysis are given in table 8 this study identified four indicators that showed higher effective weights than their respective theoretical weights the mean effective weights of these indicators namely d r c and t are 26 7 19 1 16 1 and 7 7 respectively which are slightly higher than their corresponding theoretical weights of 21 7 17 3 13 0 and 4 3 respectively in contrast none of the other indicators contributed higher effective weight values than their respective theoretical weights this particular sensitivity analysis infers that d r c and t are the significant contributors to vulnerability assessment using the drastic model 5 2 model validation validation of a model is essential and obligatory for further use of its outcomes in the context of the present study water chemistry data dissolved chemical constituents were employed to validate the drastic based vulnerable aquifers by means of correlation statistics srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 moratalla et al 2011 jamrah et al 2008 herlinger and viero 2007 bazimenyera and zhonghua 2008 validation using only one chemical parameter is not a legitimate way to prove that a certain aquifer is vulnerable owing to the fact that the level of an individual indicator is subject to its exposure to a particular contaminant hamza et al 2015 therefore in this study attempts were made to validate the model outcome with multiple possible chemical contaminants for the validation purpose we employed correlation techniques using three groundwater parameters namely electrical conductivity ec nitrate no3ˉ and chromium cr these three chemical parameters were expected to reveal the contamination status of the groundwater system as mentioned earlier forty two 42 groundwater samples were collected from different locations which were used for the validation purpose in this study after overlying with the vulnerability map fifteen 15 samples fell in the least vulnerable zone twenty 20 in the moderately vulnerable zone and the remaining seven 7 samples in the highest vulnerability zone fig 6 the ec in the groundwater samples ranges from 140 to 1030 μs cm a near strong positive pearson correlation r 0 42 between ec and drastic vulnerability classes fig 7 a revealed that ec is low 500 μs cm in low vulnerable zones and vice versa the increasing trend of groundwater ec 750 μs cm in high vulnerability zones is suggestive of groundwater contamination by waste water from industries which are usually high in tds the spatial distribution of ec having high values in high vulnerability areas on the groundwater vulnerability map fig 6a supports this observation as well naturally nitrate no3ˉ occurs in very low concentrations in groundwater and its increasing trend is indicative of contamination from sewage and nitrogen bearing fertilizers used in agriculture though no3ˉ in the groundwater samples are low in concentrations ranging from 0 02 to 5 55 mg l mostly 1 mg l throughout the study area a positive value of pearson s correlation coefficient r 0 19 fig 7b and relatively higher concentration of nitrate in the high vulnerability zones on the groundwater vulnerability map fig 6b also validate the model outcome chromium cr in groundwater is commonly introduced through human activities such as mining use of chemicals in industry and agricultural in the recent past numerous industries mostly dying tanneries and other chemical factories were built in the study area lacking proper effluent management systems the measured cr concentrations of the samples ranging from 3 5 to 35 μg l are within permissible limits of the who guideline value of 50 μg l nevertheless a positive correction r 0 24 fig 7c with vulnerable classes and an increasing trend of cr concentration in groundwater of the moderate to highly vulnerable areas fig 6c further validates the model outcome 6 discussion and conclusions this study is one of the initial and comprehensive efforts to identify the aquifers in bangladesh that are at risk of acute contamination from industrial effluent savar a densely populated and rapidly growing industrial hub in bangladesh was selected for a case study it is obvious that assessment of groundwater vulnerability to pollution is vital in facilitating sustainable groundwater resource management wang et al 2012 in this context the drastic method is considered to be an easy and comprehensive tool for assessing groundwater vulnerability at a specific site by means of spatial integration of various thematic layers in the gis interface this particular approach considers both geological and hydrogeological attributes controlling factors of aquifer contamination in assessing groundwater vulnerability in this study we have deployed the original drastic model originally proposed by aller et al 1985 without modifying any of its indicators other researchers have modified the original method either adding or removing indicators hao et al 2017 li et al 2017 singh et al 2015 complex morphological structures aquifer heterogeneity undefined sources of pollution were given as possible reasons for the modifications wang et al 2012 the scale of the study and the availability of spatial and non spatial attributes may also encourage researchers to modify the drastic model to obtain better model outcomes singh et al 2015 wu et al 2016 we have tried to keep the data as simple as possible not modifying any of the original drastic parameters so that the results can be easily used by stakeholders mimi and assi 2009 according to nguyet and goldscheider 2006 models including data and procedures should be simple enough that they can be used for raising awareness and mitigation programs the drastic groundwater vulnerability map of the study area fig 5 reveals significant variation in the index values in areas with different morphological geological and hydrogeological characteristics this finding is similar to the corresponding studies in other parts of the world ckakraborty et al 2007 rahman 2008 srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 the vulnerability map reveals that the floodplains with shallow aquifer depths have the highest vulnerability indexes whereas the upland areas with thick clay cover 15 m have the lowest vulnerability indexes the high vulnerability reported by ckakraborty et al 2007 and rahman 2008 of aquifers in similar geomorphic settings also confirms that the occurrence of aquifers at shallow depths in flat topography and with unconsolidated sediments sand and silt in the vadose zone enhances their susceptibility to contamination nonetheless it is worth mentioning that the vulnerability index classes are relative in the sense that sites with low vulnerability are not entirely safe from the threat of groundwater contamination just less susceptible than highly vulnerable sites sensitivity analyses of the groundwater vulnerability map in the study area show that among the drastic indicators the most crucial for determining the vulnerability index for the present study appears to be d t and s the areas with high vulnerability index have aquifers at shallower depths 3 6 m flat topography slope percent 1 and sandy loam soil texture low vulnerable areas are characterized by greater depths of the aquifers 10 m terrain slope percept 5 and clayey soil texture similar studies by bojórquez tapia et al 2009 and saidi et al 2011 also identified d as the most influential indicator while t was considered significant in the study by mohammadi et al 2009 however very limited studies such as babiker et al 2005 mohammadi et al 2009 and kabera and zhaohui 2008 found s as a vital indicator although not the first ranked in vulnerability assessment it is very unlikely that the relative influence of an individual indicator would be always the same for all areas because the importance of a single indicator depends on the ranking of the other indicators as well as on the general characteristics of the study site gogu and dassargues 2000 napolitano and fabbri 1996 the validation of the model using nitrate no3 is common because of its nonexistence very low presence in groundwater under normal conditions hamza et al 2015 shirazi et al 2012 a number of studies al adamat et al 2003 baalousha 2011 boughriba et al 2010 prasad et al 2011 secunda et al 1998 sener et al 2009 yin et al 2013 have adopted no3 as an effective validation method other studies such as herlinger and viero 2007 jamrah et al 2008 moratalla et al 2011 and srinivasamoorthy et al 2011 have suggested that chemicals other than nitrate should be used to quantify groundwater vulnerability we have used chemical indicators electrical conductivity ec chromium cr and nitrate no3 to determine the accuracy of the groundwater vulnerability map of the study area a positive correlation however weak of electrical conductivity ec chromium cr and nitrate no3 concentration with the drastic index of this study suggests an increasing trend in the concentration of these constituents though the aquifers in savar are still safe in terms of pollution but increasing trend of these parameters signifies that groundwater in the study area is under threat of pollution over the course of time the drastic method has a number of advantages over other methods and few drawbacks as well hamza et al 2007 for instance in data scarce research it is difficult to scrutinize lithology which is needed for the assessment of aquifer media soil media vadose zone if bore log information is limited lack of subsurface information may also lead to general or vague permeability estimates in a highly heterogeneous aquifer similarly it is unrealistic to expect a meaningful drastic map from a few data over a large area the usefulness of the drastic method depends largely on the available information i e density of the data and map scale aller et al 1985 evans and myers 1990 kim and hamm 1999 leone et al 2009 rahman 2008 thirumalaivasan et al 2003 in addition the drastic index is highly sensitive to the scores weights and the numerical values assigned to each indicator during model computation as is evident from the literature potential groundwater recharge from rivers and standing water bodies has not yet been considered in the development of the vulnerability index al adamat et al 2003 baalousha 2011 boughriba et al 2010 prasad et al 2011 secunda et al 1998 sener et al 2009 yin et al 2013 this must be considered as a weakness in the application of the drastic method a major drawback of vulnerability mapping is the difficulty in validation andreo et al 2006 it should be noted that a significant concentration of a specific pollutant in certain zones cannot be used as a robust calibration tool for drastic results rather it depends on the existing land use patterns spatial extent and location of the potential contamination sources and their seasonal and temporal variations wang et al 2012 despite the fact the present study selected and processed the precise thematic layers for the drastic model there were still some limitations since the study area is relatively large in size 280 km2 the non availability of densely spaced values for the drastic indicators was the main hindrance in obtaining a high resolution vulnerability map keeping the limitations of the present study in mind it may be concluded that the groundwater vulnerability map of the study area can be effective in providing broad scale information on the susceptible areas of groundwater contamination even though the overall groundwater quality in the study area was found to be good the increasing trend in certain water quality parameters particularly in the highly and moderately vulnerable zones is indicative of the introduction of pollutants from anthropogenic sources and therefore the groundwater resources are under the potential risk of contamination in the near future periodic monitoring of groundwater quality in the high and moderate vulnerable zones is essential for early detection and to prevent further deterioration of the groundwater resources acknowledgments the authors are thankful to the ministry of science and

12216,turbidity removal from surface water was investigated in laboratory columns to identify critical hydrogeological factors during bank filtration such as fine content soil bed depth hydraulic gradient grain size d50 of aquifer materials as well as detention and operation time effect of hydrogeological factors on electrical conductivity was also evaluated with increase in detention and operation time increase in turbidity removal efficiency and electrical conductivity was observed for both aquifer material as well as modified aquifer materials the turbidity removal efficiency for aquifer material increased from 70 to 87 6 and 62 4 79 1 with increase in detention time and operation time from 1 h to 7 h respectively it was found that removal of turbidity increased from 84 1 to 100 with increase in percentage fine content from 7 5 to 17 5 increased from 90 to 99 with increase in soil bed depth from 25 cm to 85 cm and increased from 74 1 to 92 with decrease in grain size i e d50 from 3 mm to 0 17 mm considering detention time of 7 h multiple linear regression analysis was used to demonstrate the vital hydro geological factors affecting turbidity removal out of different hydro geological factors detention time and fine content were directly proportional to turbidity removal efficiency while turbidity removal efficiency was inversely proportional to hydraulic gradient and mean grain size validation of model was done using field study data done at two river bank filtration sites which gave satisfactory results and thus ensuring the precision of model developed graphical abstract image 1 keywords river bank filtration production wells india aquifer material soil column hydro geological factors 1 introduction water is one of the vital natural resources without which existence of human beings on this planet is not possible broadly sources of water for human beings can be classified into two categories which are surface water and ground water numerous geogenic activities heavy rainfall erosion and weathering of rocks and manmade activities industrialization urbanization and agriculture are among the major causes responsible for surface as well as ground water pollution champidi et al 2011 in developing countries like india rapid industrialisation gives rise to uneven increase in water demand increase in population results in a production of numerous water pollutants which appears as a threat to global environment ground water is mostly recharged through precipitation which occurs on the surface of the earth hence decrease in precipitation rate due to increase in population reduces the chances of ground water recharge usual source of water for most of the cities in india is in the form of surface water but due to lack of water supply network in remote locations and non availability of consistent municipal water supply there is an increase in ground water demand which in turn causes a rapid depletion of ground water table hence usage of ground water is to be restricted and usage of surface water should be promoted available drinking water should meet the physical chemical and microbiological requirements as specified by the country s standard natural layer of aquifer material is conventionally used for extracting surface water this filtration process of extracting surface water through the adjacent aquifer river is named as river bank filtration rbf rbf process is achieved by extracting ground water so as to lower the ground water table below the adjacent surface water table due to the difference in water level the surface water infiltrates through the bank of river into the adjacent aquifer the infiltration of influent river can flow naturally into the production wells or it may be induced by extraction wells horizontal or vertical or production wells may be used for extracting bank filtrate sandhu et al 2010 the quality of surface water changes as it flows through aquifer due to natural processes such as filtration sorption acid base reaction oxidation reduction hydrolysis biochemical reactions etc rbf has been shown to be effective in attenuating a wide variety of materials including turbidity natural organic matter pesticides pharmaceuticals taste and odor causing compounds and microorganisms etc the rbf thus could be classified as a low cost treatment or pre treatment method dash et al 2010 studies have shown that rbf is a highly efficient method for significant removal of turbidity wang et al 1995 dillon et al 2002a b lee et al 2009 dash et al 2008 2010 2015 organic micro pollutants baumgarten et al 2011 bertelkamp et al 2014 grünheid et al 2005 huntscha et al 2013 scheurer et al 2012 schmidt et al 2007 storck et al 2012 natural organic matter nom pesticides and pharmaceuticals miettinen et al 1994 doussan et al 1997 kuehn and mueller 2000 ray et al 2002 verstraeten et al 2002 wang 2002 massmann et al 2003 salinity dillon et al 2002a b ray et al 2002 reported that temperature and turbidity are the physical contaminants of the greatest concern as high temperature favours re growth of bacteria in distribution systems while high turbidity can negatively impact source water quality he also reported that turbidity can fluctuate significantly and is a concern for rivers that traverse through clay rich formations where the river water becomes loaded with colloidal and suspended particles such as clay metal hydroxo compounds from elements namely fe2 and mn2 according to pholkern et al 2015 the induced infiltration of river water through the river bank also creates a clogging layer this decreases river bank permeability and abstraction rates particularly if the river water has high turbidity sahoo et al 2005 illustrated the development and application of three types of artificial neural networks anns to estimate the effectiveness of two rbf facilities in the us the feed forward back propagation network bpn and radial basis function network rbfn model prediction results produced excellent agreement with measured data at a correlation coefficient above 0 99 for filtrate water quality parameters including temperature as well as turbidity heterotrophic bacteria and coliform removal saini et al 2013 studied that electrical conductivity ec and major ions were found to be more in production wells pw than the surface water river canal at rbf site at haridwar turbidity total and fecal coliform of water from the pws were not found to vary significantly during winter and spring months from the investigations on rbf at mathura singh et al 2010 it was found that the river water turbidity fluctuated significantly during the monitoring period 3 83 86 0 ntu however in the filtrate it remained less than 1 ntu ojha and thakur 2011 carried out a study to assess the variation of turbidity in the source water and the abstracted water at a river bank filtration site in haridwar and found that the turbidity removal coefficient varies with the natural logarithm of influent concentration of the source water from the studies done by the researchers it was found that rbf is effective in attenuating a wide variety of materials including turbidity natural organic matter pesticides pharmaceuticals taste and odour causing compounds etc the importance of environmental and hydraulic factors during rbf is also discussed however very few information is available as to how the aquifer characteristics are directly affecting water quality parameters during river bank filtration environmental factors which include different physical chemical and biological processes such as filtration biodegradation adsorption ion exchange ground water mixing and hydraulic factors such as detention time flow velocity affect the attenuation of pollutant during passage of surface water through the aquifer during river bank filtration the pollutant removal is dependent on various hydrogeological factors which need to be studied therefore a study was undertaken with an objective to evaluate the performance of river bank filtration in attenuating major surface water pollutants i e turbidity in different aquifer condition which will assist in selection of proper rbf site before execution of the project 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental investigation 2 1 1 materials soil sample was collected at a depth of 5 m below ground level 0 5 m below ground water level in the aquifer lying within the bank of kharala river of sambalpur district odisha the soil samples collected at this depth is representative of the soil layer of the aquifer grain size distribution of the aquifer sample was done according to is 2720 1985 the properties of the aquifer material are given in table 1 2 1 2 flow condition column experiments on aquifer soil compacted at field density and moisture content were carried out for the above investigation two different column setup having columns of 3 8 cm internal diameter and 120 cm height made up of perspex sheets were used for the continuous column studies i e a regulated flow set up to maintain different detention time b gravity flow set up to maintain different operation time schematic diagram of continuous column set up for regulated flow and gravity flow is shown at fig 1 a and b respectively feeding inlet water was passed fed into each column from the top to bottom and the percolated outlet water was collected at the bottom sampling port overflow pipe was provided at top of the soil layer to prevent excessive hydraulic build up on top of column for regulated flow different column experiments were conducted for different detention time for a single packed bed material soil detention time was measured by calculating the time taken td ve qe for a given amount of outlet water effluent to pass through the column at a given rate of effluent flow qe where effluent volume ve nvc is calculated by multiplying the volume of the soil column vc with porosity of the soil n different detention time was achieved by changing the effluent flow rate the effluent flow rate was maintained throughout the experiment by adjusting control valve and checked regularly with graduated measuring cylinder and timer the electrical conductivity ec of the effluent was measured continuously till it reached a constant value all the samples for further analysis were collected after the time equal to detention time has been elapsed as well as the electrical conductivity of the effluent attained a constant value influent flow rate qi was maintained at a range between 1 and 12 litres day for different packing materials and detention time for gravity flow single column experiment was conducted for different operation time for a single packed bed material soil operation time was measured by calculating the time elapsed from the time at which steady state is reached to the time at which sample was collected for the experiment flow was not controlled at the outlet and allowed to flow under gravity influent flow rate was maintained at a range between 5 and 15 liters day for different packing materials percolated water samples were collected at different operation time and analyzed for turbidity and electrical conductivity 2 1 3 packed bed materials packed bed materials used for the studies were a aquifer material in situ soil and b modified aquifer materials for the study with aquifer material the disturbed soil collected from the field was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and then it was compacted in the perspex column at field moisture content to the field density for the study to find the effect of bed depth and hydraulic gradient aquifer material collected from the field was used as packed bed material and the height of the aquifer material was varied from 25 to 85 cm hydraulic gradients varied from 1 12 to 1 4 in order to simulate and study the effect of distance of collector well from river bank as well as hydraulic gradient for the study to find the effect of fine content the collected aquifer materials having fine content of 7 5 was taken as packed bed material for one column experiment for other five column experiments modified aquifer materials were taken as packed bed materials where dry sample for modified aquifer materials was prepared with varying fine content from 9 5 to 17 5 with increments of 2 for the study to find the effect of particle size the collected aquifer materials having mean particle size i e d50 0 3 mm was taken as packed bed material for one column experiment for other three column experiments modified aquifer materials were taken as packed bed materials where dry sample for modified aquifer materials was prepared from in situ soil by sieving it to three different sizes i e i coarse sand having size between 4 75 mm and 2 mm d50 3 mm ii medium sand having size between 2 mm 0 425 mm d50 0 92 mm and iii fine sand having size between 0 425 mm 0 075 mm d50 0 17 mm for each column experiments packed bed materials were compacted at field moisture content in the perspex column to the field density all the experiments were performed at room temperature and in saturated conditions for each packed bed material the experiments were carried out for both flow conditions i e regulated and gravity flow 2 1 4 feeding water water used for feeding was mixture of water from river kharla and ground water collected from a well nearest to river kharla for additional artificial turbidity fuller s earth was added to feeding water water of electrical conductivity 325 15 μs cm turbidity 30 120 ntu was fed to the column filled with different type of packed bed material as explained earlier 2 1 5 sample collection contaminated water was allowed to flow through soil column percentage reduction in turbidity was computed and its variation with change in geotechnical properties and hydraulic characteristics were noted down electrical conductivity and turbidity were measured for both inlet and outlet water samples all the experiments were conducted twice by collecting the percolated water effluent in duplicate after passing through different packed bed material for different detention time for regulated flow and different operation time for gravity flow 2 2 modelling a multiple regression analysis using statistical software package minitab 2017 was used to obtain an expression that correlates turbidity removal to ordinary soil properties stepwise regression was used to run the model in order to determine the most salient soil properties governing the equation related to turbidity removal computation multiple linear regression was then engaged to determine a linear equation which was used to compute turbidity removal based on the vital soil properties as discussed earlier 2 3 field studies field studies were carried out at two water supply schemes in the state of odisha india where rbf system is in place water samples were collected from the existing production wells which are getting water through rbf as well as from the rivers 2 3 1 study area first water supply scheme is located at river rushikulya fig 2 a of odisha state river water was collected through three production wells near the village badamadhapur of ganjam district and the extracted water is supplied to nearby berhampur town catering to a population of more than 0 3 million these three bore wells i e production wells pwr1 pwr2 and pwr3 having depth of 27 m and diameter of 5 m were installed in 1983 pwr1 pwr 2 and pwr3 are located at a distance of 27 100 and 45 m from river respectively second water supply scheme is located at river kharala fig 2 b at kuchinda town which is under sambalpur district in the state of odisha the city is located at 21 73 n 84 35 e it has an average elevation of 220 m three production wells were installed in 2010 on river kharala at kuchinda town the first production well pwk1 is of diameter 2 m depth 22 m and located on the right bank of the river within 3 m from river the river water filters through the horizontal perforated pipes laid 20 m below the river bank and collected in the production well the second pwk2 and

study was carried out in twelve phases water samples were collected during summer i e pre monsoon season march may monsoon june august and post monsoon september november periods in the year 2016 and 2017 number of samples being four in each period in a year water samples were collected from two different locations at river rushikulia rwr1 and rwr2 surface water three production wells pwr1 pwr2 and pwr3 river bank filtered water and two deep bore wells at a distance of more than 5 km from the river gwr1 and gwr2 ground water at badmadhabpur fig 2 a similarly water samples were collected from two different locations at river kharala rwk1 and rwk2 surface water three production wells pwk1 pwk2 and pwk3 river bank filtered water and two deep bore wells at a distance of more than 7 5 km from the river gwk1 and gwk2 ground water at kuchinda fig 2 b hydro geological relationship between production wells and river for both study areas is shown at fig 3 the aquifer at both study sites comprises stream deposits to a depth of 31 m badmadhabpur and 15 m kuchinda below ground and sediments ranging from fine sand and silt to medium sand and gravel the aquifers can be described as a single layer system which is in direct hydraulic contact with the river during low flow in the rivers during summer water level in the production wells get reduced and during high flow in the rivers during monsoon water level in the production wells get raised artificial pumping was done using the submersible pumps present inside the production wells in order to collect the water samples sampler was used to collect surface water samples from the upper layer of river water polyethylene bottles were used to collect the water samples the collection transportation preservation and analysis of the collected water samples were carried out in accordance with the procedures mentioned in the standard methods apha 2005 soil samples were collected every four meters during installation of bore well at river rushikulya and river kharala up to the depths of 12 m and 16 5 m respectively 2 4 methodology soil samples and water samples were analyzed in the geotechnical and environmental engineering laboratory of the department of civil engineering vssut burla soil samples were analyzed for grain size distribution using dry sieving in accordance with the approved procedures is 2720 and porosity of soil was also computed turbidity and sulphate concentration in water samples were determined using a nephelometer systronics 135 proper care was taken during the measurement of turbidity readings by ensuring low sedimentation rate and avoiding formation of air bubble in the samples ph and electrical conductivity were measured using ph and conductivity meters conductivity 720 systronics 306 and orion stara 2145 germany considering the effort to minimise the error due to temperature and other environmental parameters respectively chloride was measured using titration method 3 results and discussions 3 1 column studies soil column tests were performed to study leaching aspect of aquifer material and removal of turbidity due to different processes taking place during passage of river

for regulated flow and different operation time i e 1 8 h for gravity flow 3 1 1 effect of detention time and operation time to study the effect of detention time and operation time a series of experiments were conducted with in situ soil as aquifer material having fine content 7 5 d50 0 3 mm soil bed depth 25 cm and hydraulic gradient 1 4 the results are presented in fig 4 which shows the effect of detention time and operation time on removal of turbidity from the filtrate collected at the outlet of aquifer material from fig 4 it can be observed that with increase in detention time as well as operation time the removal of turbidity increases the mean removal efficiency of turbidity increased from 70 in detention time of 1 h 87 6 in 7 h no significance increase was observed after 7 h of detention time the removal efficiency with respect to detention time was not linear removal rate was higher in 1 h detention time and the rate of increase in removal efficiency decreased with increase in detention time when suspended and colloidal materials are transported by a liquid flowing through porous media they are removed by various mechanisms such as straining in the contact zones of adjacent pores sedimentation in the pores interception higher removal rate at lower detention time may be attributed to straining in the contact zones of adjacent pores however with increase in detention time decrease in flow rate the mechanism which seems to be predominate is sedimentation in the pores garg 2013 corapcioglu and haridas 1984 from fig 4 further it can be observed that removal efficiency increases with increase in operating time this increase may be due to decrease in flow rate nearly 40 65 drop in flow rate with passage of time due to clogging and formation of filter cake colmation layer on the solid surface of top sand the physical straining process and inter particle attraction were improved due to the formation of filter cake ngai and walewijk 2003 studied the effect of filter cake and concluded that the formation of filter cake can be a significant cause of bacterial and turbidity removal in sand filters it is observed that as compared to the effect of operation time the effect of detention time is more significant in the removal efficiency fig 5 shows the effect of detention time and operation time on electrical conductivity ec of in situ soil leaching potential of in situ soil with respect to detention time was studied by measuring ec in the percolated water at different detention time as well as operation time from fig 5 it can be observed that the ec increases almost at a constant rate with increase in the detention time up to 7 h beyond which it remains constant ec at 7hr detention time was found to be 419 μs cm increase in ec with detention time may be due to leaching of dissolved solids most of the leaching took place during initial detention times similar effect was observed for operation time however the variation of electrical conductivity with operation time is less as compared to that with detention time from fig 5 it was observed that ec increases with increase in operation time up to 6 h beyond which no further leaching occurred i e soil column is fully leached in 6 h maximum ec value was found at 6 h running time i e 383 μs cm from fig 6 it can be observed that the discharge decreases with operation time the discharge goes on decreasing due to gradual clogging of voids in the soil by the suspended solids with turbid water flow the decrease in discharge indicates that the permeability of the soil decreases with the flow of water due to the clogging clogging mainly occurs due to the presence of suspended solids in water the discharge at 8 h of operation time was observed to be 5 67 l d where influent flow rate was 15 l d 3 1 2 effect of fine content to study the effect of fine content on turbidity removal efficiency electrical conductivity and discharge modified aquifer material with various fine contents were prepared as explained earlier six different soil columns were used with different fine percentages keeping other influencing parameters constant d50 0 3 mm soil bed depth 25 cm and hydraulic gradient 1 4 fig 7 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time respectively on removal of turbidity in aquifer material and modified aquifer material having different percentage of fines the result shows that the fine content has a significant effect on the removal efficiency of turbidity it is also observed that for all types of aquifer material with increase in detention time as well as operation time the removal efficiency of turbidity has increased from fig 7 a it can be observed that for 1 h detention time the maximum removal of turbidity i e 86 occurs at modified aquifer materials having 17 5 fines minimum removal of turbidity for detention time of 1 h i e 70 was observed for the aquifer material having fine percentage of 7 5 similarly maximum removal of turbidity i e 100 occurs at modified aquifer materials having 15 5 as well as 17 5 fines at the detention time of 7 h and 6 h respectively minimum removal of turbidity for detention time of 8hrs i e 87 6 is observed for the aquifer material having fine percentage of 7 5 for all types of aquifer material the removal rate was higher in lower detention time and rate of increase in removal efficiency decreased with increase in detention time from the figure it can also be observed that maximum removal efficiency is achieved at detention time close to 6 h after which no significant improvement in turbidity removal was observed particularly for higher fine percentage experiments it is also observed that as the detention time increases increase rate of efficiency with fine content decreases especially after 4 h detention time from fig 7 b it can be observed that the minimum removal efficiency is 62 4 corresponding to 1 h operation time and 7 5 fine content with increase in operation time for the same aquifer material the removal efficiency has increased to 79 2 at operation time of 8 h similarly with increase in fine from 7 5 to 17 5 the increase in efficiency was found to be 19 6 for operation time of 1 h and 18 5 for operation time of 8 h from the figure it can also be observed that removal efficiency at 8 h operation time for aquifer material having 7 5 fine 79 2 is less than the removal efficiency at 1 h operation time for aquifer material having 17 5 fine 82 it means that aquifer material having more fine percentage is prone to clogging at an early stage thereby reducing the rate of discharge and increasing the removal efficiency presence of higher percentage of fines increased the physical straining of turbidity producing suspended and colloidal materials thereby increasing the removal efficiency fig 8 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time on ec in aquifer and modified aquifer material having different percentage of fines from the figures it can be observed that the ec increases with increase in the percentage of fines for both regulated flow and gravitational flow presence of finer material increases the extent of mineralization from the aquifer material which results in increase in ec it can also be observed that maximum increase in ec takes place at initial detention and initial operation times at lower fine content 7 5 13 5 no increase in ec was observed after 7 8 h of detention time or operation time but at higher fine content the change of ec was observed till 10 11 h of detention time or operation time the change in ec depends on the rate of water flow duration for which water is held up in the aquifer composition of the aquifer material and the quality of infiltrating water dash et al 2010 fig 9 shows the effect of fine content on discharge rate it can be observed that the quantity of water collected in every 1 h decreases with increase in fine content this is due to clogging of pores of soil mass by the suspended solids present in the water the decrease in discharge signifies the decrease in permeability of soil increase in detention time and increase in removal efficiency of turbidity 3 1 3 effect of bed depth and hydraulic gradient experiments were conducted on soil columns of aquifer material varying only soil bed depth and hydraulic gradient the soil bed depths of 25 40 55 70 85 cm were used under hydraulic gradients of 1 4 1 25 1 18 1 14 1 12 respectively five different columns were used for five different soil bed depths and hydraulic gradient keeping other parameters constant d50 0 3 mm fine content 7 5 hydraulic gradient is computed by dividing the total height causing the flow sum of soil bed depth and water depth above it to soil bed depth fig 10 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time on removal of turbidity in aquifer material having different bed depths and hydraulic gradients from fig 10 a it can be observed that with increase in bed depth and decrease in hydraulic gradient turbidity removal efficiency increased for different detention times similar observations were made for the experiments with different operation time as shown in fig 10 b from fig 10 a the minimum and maximum turbidity removal efficiencies are observed to be 70 occurring at 1 h detention time for the soil depth of 25 cm and 99 occurring at detention time of 7 h for a soil depth of 85 cm respectively with increase in detention time for the soil depth of 25 cm the removal efficiency increased to 87 6 detention time of 7hr similarly with increase in soil depth from 25 cm to 85 cm the increase in efficiency was observed to be 11 5 at detention time of 1 h and 11 4 at detention time of 7 h from the figure it can also be observed that maximum removal efficiency is achieved near 7hr detention time for different soil depths after which no significant improvement was observed maximum rate of turbidity removal takes place for the soil column with minimum soil depth and minimum detention time but with increase in depth of soil column and detention time the removal efficiency is observed to increase at a lower rate the turbidity removal efficiency with respect to depth was found to be non linear so it could be concluded that removal efficiency was dependent upon the bed depth as well as flow rate detention time from fig 10 b it can be observed that for 1 h operation time the maximum removal of turbidity i e 85 occurs at soil depth of 85 cm minimum removal of turbidity for operation time of 1 h i e 62 4 is observed for soil depth of 25 cm similarly maximum removal of turbidity i e 96 5 occurs at soil depth of 85 cm at the detention time of 6 h minimum removal of turbidity for detention time of 6 h i e 79 is observed for the soil depth of 25 cm with increase in soil depth the removal efficiency of turbidity increases but the rate of increase in removal efficiency decreased with increase in bed depth higher removal efficiency was observed at initial depths this may be due to the fact that most of physical straining and majority of biological processes takes place in the first few centimetres of the filtration depth biological processes include metabolic breakdown predation scavenging natural death and inactivation haarhoff and cleasby 1991 it is also observed that as the soil height is increased the time taken to saturate the entire soil mass increases the turbidity removal also increases with the height as the void space available is more with the increased soil height the suspended solids thus get clogged in the available void spaces and hence the removal efficiency increases with the increase in the soil height the increase in bed depth contributes to better filtration as greater surface area provides a more intimate contact between the constituents of the raw water thus speeding up chemical reactions surface catalysis huisman and wood 1974 similar observation has been made for slow sand filter where research confirmed that the majority of biological processes occur in the top 0 4 m of the sand bed logsdon 1991 further during river bank filtration bacterial transport in soil and other unconsolidated or consolidated materials depends strongly on material properties in fine sand the migration of bacteria and suspended solids is limited and most of the bacteria and suspended solids are removed at the beginning of infiltration many within the first 0 5 m bellamy et al 1985 preuss 1996 albrechtsen et al 1998 fig 11 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time on conductivity at different soil depth and hydraulic gradient it can be observed that the ec is increasing with the increase in bed height soil depth it clearly indicates that with increase in soil height the amount of clay in soil and the dissolved solids in water increases resulting in more leaching and more ec fig 12 shows the effect of soil bed height hydraulic gradient on discharge it is observed that the quantity of water collected in every hour goes on decreasing as the suspended solids get clogged in the void spaces of the soil masses as the height of soil column increases the retention time of water in the soil increases resulting a more travel time to deliver the required quantity of water so for the given time interval when the soil height goes on increasing the discharge reduces considerably 3 1 4 particle size for the experiments aquifer material and modified aquifer material having different particle size i e in situ soil d50 0 3 mm coarse sand having size between 4 75 mm and 2 mm d50 3 mm medium sand having size between 2 mm 0 425 mm d50 0 92 mm and fine sand having size between 0 425 mm 0 075 mm d50 0 17 mm was used four different columns were used for four different particle size where other parameters are kept constant fine content 7 5 soil bed depth 25 cm and hydraulic gradient 1 4 fig 1 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time on removal of turbidity in aquifer material and modified aquifer material having different particle size d50values for the regulated flow fig 13 a maximum removal efficiency of 93 was achieved at detention time of 8 h for the fine sand however no significant change was observed after 6 h detention time where the removal efficiency is 89 minimum removal occurs in case of coarse fraction and is 74 at 8 h detention time removal efficiency at 1 h detention time for fine sand is almost same that of 8hr detention time of coarse sand from fig 13 b it can be observed that for the coarse sand the removal efficiency was minimal with minimum efficiency of 51 and maximum efficiency of 66 7 similarly in the medium sand the minimum removal efficiency was 60 1 and maximum removal efficiency was 88 7 and in the fine fraction the maximum removal efficiency is 92 8 which occurs after 8 h of operation time maximum removal efficiency was taking place at initial operation time from the study it was found that column having fine fraction performed better than those having medium and coarse fraction similar results are found by jenkins et al 2009 where he found that filters using finer sand d10 of 0 17 mm performed significantly better in terms of turbidity bacteria and virus removal than filters using coarser sand d10 of 0 52 mm research done by logan et al 2001 on intermittent sand filter columns of 60 cm sand revealed that fine grained sand columns d10 of 0 16 mm effectively removed cryptosporidium oocysts under the variety of conditions examined coarse grained media columns d10 0 90 mm yielded larger numbers of oocysts which were commonly observed in the effluent regardless of operating conditions laszlo and literathy 2002 found that the pollutant removal dilution rate depends on the raw water composition porous filtration medium properties and biogeochemical processes during infiltration fig 14 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time on ec for different particle sizes from both figures it can be observed that for modified aquifer soil the leaching is much more than the in situ soil this may be due to presence of similar sized soil particles in modified soil higher coefficient of uniformity i e cu value poorly graded soil in comparison to in situ soil where it has soil particles of different sizes lower cu value well graded soil for the modified aquifer soil higher ec was observed for fine sand this is due to presence of greater surface area in fine sand which provides more intimate contact between the water and soil particles thus speeding up chemical reactions and there by increasing leachability of the soil huisman and wood 1974 fig 15 shows the effect of variation in particle sizes on discharge from the graph it could be concluded that the discharge has decreased with the decrease in the particle sizes 3 1 5 modelling variation in soil properties results in deviation in turbidity removal achieved by various soil specimens regression tool like multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that four soil parameters were vital as far as determination of turbidity removal by the soil is concerned these four parameters are fine content hydraulic gradient d50 and detention time as mentioned in table 2 the equation describing the relationship between the turbidity removal and these four soil parameter is given below 1 turbidity removal 112 96 0 8491 fine content 34 81 hydraulic gradient 4 731 d50 2 6457 detention time regression analysis helped in correlating the turbidity removal by the soil samples with the soil parameter strongly r2 0 9588 it suggests that nearly 90 of the variability in turbidity removal could be described by fine hydraulic gradient average particle size d50 and detention time table 2 as p values for the independent variables were all 0 05 hence the above four parameter model was statistically rigorous at the 95 confidence level from the above observations it is noted that the independent variable like soil parameters considerably contribute to prediction of dependent variable like turbidity removal there was no significant collinearity between independent variable as indicated by the variance inflation factor vif table 2 multi collinearity was not seen in the variables and the parameter estimates are reliable because values for vif are 1 or slightly larger vif is less than four hence collinearity is not an issue both constant variance test and normality test were successfully passed by the model as shown in fig 16 and fig 17 this model suggests that turbidity removal percentage is enhanced by parameters like fine content hydraulic gradient and detention time with increase in fine of a given soil sample the specific surface area of soil particles increases as a result of which more surface area is available for more sorption of particles hence turbidity removal percentage increases the percentage of fine particles and the mean size of particles were included in the model because these parameters may directly affect the settling velocity of the particles in suspension during the movement of particles in the voids of soil samples as soil depth increases it has a tendency to increase the number of clogged layers as a result of which successive clogging takes place hence turbidity removal increases it can be observed from table 2 that out of four hydrogeological factors detention time is the most critical parameter in turbidity removal process with increase in detention time there will be enhancement of the sedimentation process of the suspended particles present in water into the micro pores mesopores as well as macro pores of the aquifer causing more particles to settle it can also be seen that hydraulic gradient had a negative effect on turbidity removal as with increase in hydraulic gradient the flow of water is increasing as a result of which there is reduction in turbidity removal percentage 3 2 field studies the values for some of the water quality parameters for the samples collected at each location in different periods are presented in table 3 water from both rivers i e rushikulya and kharala have more turbidity in monsoon period in comparison to non monsoon periods and having turbidity 20 50 times more than that of non monsoonal although the river water turbidity fluctuated significantly during the sampling period 4 198 ntu the turbidity of the production well water i e rbf was below 2 ntu as the river water passes through the aquifer the water gets filtered and most of the turbidity and organics are removed ray et al 2002 reduction in turbidity in the water samples collected from the production wells were significant fig 18 a the water from production wells showed 2 0 2 2 log reduction of turbidity in monsoon period 0 6 1 3 log reduction of turbidity in pre monsoon period and 1 0 1 36 log removal of turbidity in post monsoon period the fate and transport of suspended and colloidal particles in the subsurface were controlled by several processes including advection dispersion physicochemical filtration straining and dilution of these physicochemical filtration plays a significant role in the removal of turbidity from the river water during the passage to the pws dash et al 2015 water from the river gets mineralized as it flows through the aquifer to the production wells the ratio of electrical conductivity in pws to surface water for different periods are shown in fig 18 b indicating maximum concentration of dissolved solids in pwk 3 as it is located at a greater distance from the river bank mean values of electrical conductivity of river water at first study site was 200 μs cm in monsoon period and 306 μs cm in non monsoon period whereas for water from pw it was 293 μs cm in monsoon period and 445 μs cm in non monsoon period similarly mean values of electrical conductivity of river water at second study site was 118 μs cm in monsoon period and 178 μs cm in non monsoon period whereas for water from pw it was 197 μs cm in monsoon period and 231 μs cm in non monsoon period this may be due to the mixing of groundwater and infiltrated surface water from the river another reason may be due to weathering and or leaching of materials from the deposits into the percolated water dash et al 2010 water from the rivers production wells and deep ground water were analysed for cl and so4 2 so as to use them as natural tracer davis et al 1980 gu et al 2008 for finding the proportion of river water in the production wells ground water contains highest amount cl and so4 2 content which is followed by production wells and then river water the river bank filtered water is a mixture of surface water and ground water shamrukh and wahab 2008 from the cl and so4 2 data for production wells ground water and river water given in table 3 it can be observed that of river water in pws water is more in monsoon season and of river water is less in pws water in summer season because of availability of higher hydraulic gradient in monsoon season as maximum river water flow occurs when compared to river water flow in other seasons grain size analysis carried out as per indian soilclassification is 1498 1970 was used for estimating hydraulic conductivity table 4 and found to be in the range of 45 72 m day average 51 m day for study site 1 and in range of 33 62 m day average 45 m day for study site 2 the travel time detention time between the screens of the production wells and the surface water is an important parameter for bacteria and turbidity removal dash et al 2008 for this study darcy s law was used to compute the travel time by the measured water level of the river as well as of production wells assuming that the river water percolates at the bed using the calculated detention time hydraulic gradient fine percentage and d50 values in equation 1 turbidity removal at field condition was estimated and given in table 5 it can be observed that with the field condition the turbidity removal should be 100 where as actual field observation indicates turbidity removal of more than 99 in the most of the seasons except pre monsoon or summer season less turbidity removal was observed during the non monsoon period as river water contains less turbidity during this period less than 5 ntu 4 conclusion effect of different aquifer characteristics i e percentage fine soil bed depth hydraulic gradient grain size d50 as well as different hydraulic characteristics such as detention time and operation time on turbidity removal as well as on electrical conductivity was established through column studies and through regression model removal of turbidity during field studies indicate the effectiveness of river bank filtration in actual field condition where as the laboratory column studies provide insight in to the importance of different hydrogeological properties responsible for achieving the same from the study it can be concluded that turbidity removal efficiency and electrical conductivity increased with increase in detention and operation time increase in percentage fine increase in soil bed depth and decrease in grain size and hydraulic gradient similar results were observed in multiple linear regression analysis for hydrogeological parameters such as fine content hydraulic gradient mean grain size d50 and detention time for various aquifer conditions having different values of hydrogeological parameters turbidity removal efficiency can be calculated using multiple linear regression equation used in the present investigation this will definitely assist in optimising the location of production wells for different river sites having rbf system in place or having potential for developing the rbf system optimum distance of production well from the river can be calculated after optimising the location of production wells in case the production well is located at a distance more than the optimum distance the pumping cost will be high whereas if it is located at a distance less than the optimum desired turbidity removal efficiency cannot be achieved 
12216,turbidity removal from surface water was investigated in laboratory columns to identify critical hydrogeological factors during bank filtration such as fine content soil bed depth hydraulic gradient grain size d50 of aquifer materials as well as detention and operation time effect of hydrogeological factors on electrical conductivity was also evaluated with increase in detention and operation time increase in turbidity removal efficiency and electrical conductivity was observed for both aquifer material as well as modified aquifer materials the turbidity removal efficiency for aquifer material increased from 70 to 87 6 and 62 4 79 1 with increase in detention time and operation time from 1 h to 7 h respectively it was found that removal of turbidity increased from 84 1 to 100 with increase in percentage fine content from 7 5 to 17 5 increased from 90 to 99 with increase in soil bed depth from 25 cm to 85 cm and increased from 74 1 to 92 with decrease in grain size i e d50 from 3 mm to 0 17 mm considering detention time of 7 h multiple linear regression analysis was used to demonstrate the vital hydro geological factors affecting turbidity removal out of different hydro geological factors detention time and fine content were directly proportional to turbidity removal efficiency while turbidity removal efficiency was inversely proportional to hydraulic gradient and mean grain size validation of model was done using field study data done at two river bank filtration sites which gave satisfactory results and thus ensuring the precision of model developed graphical abstract image 1 keywords river bank filtration production wells india aquifer material soil column hydro geological factors 1 introduction water is one of the vital natural resources without which existence of human beings on this planet is not possible broadly sources of water for human beings can be classified into two categories which are surface water and ground water numerous geogenic activities heavy rainfall erosion and weathering of rocks and manmade activities industrialization urbanization and agriculture are among the major causes responsible for surface as well as ground water pollution champidi et al 2011 in developing countries like india rapid industrialisation gives rise to uneven increase in water demand increase in population results in a production of numerous water pollutants which appears as a threat to global environment ground water is mostly recharged through precipitation which occurs on the surface of the earth hence decrease in precipitation rate due to increase in population reduces the chances of ground water recharge usual source of water for most of the cities in india is in the form of surface water but due to lack of water supply network in remote locations and non availability of consistent municipal water supply there is an increase in ground water demand which in turn causes a rapid depletion of ground water table hence usage of ground water is to be restricted and usage of surface water should be promoted available drinking water should meet the physical chemical and microbiological requirements as specified by the country s standard natural layer of aquifer material is conventionally used for extracting surface water this filtration process of extracting surface water through the adjacent aquifer river is named as river bank filtration rbf rbf process is achieved by extracting ground water so as to lower the ground water table below the adjacent surface water table due to the difference in water level the surface water infiltrates through the bank of river into the adjacent aquifer the infiltration of influent river can flow naturally into the production wells or it may be induced by extraction wells horizontal or vertical or production wells may be used for extracting bank filtrate sandhu et al 2010 the quality of surface water changes as it flows through aquifer due to natural processes such as filtration sorption acid base reaction oxidation reduction hydrolysis biochemical reactions etc rbf has been shown to be effective in attenuating a wide variety of materials including turbidity natural organic matter pesticides pharmaceuticals taste and odor causing compounds and microorganisms etc the rbf thus could be classified as a low cost treatment or pre treatment method dash et al 2010 studies have shown that rbf is a highly efficient method for significant removal of turbidity wang et al 1995 dillon et al 2002a b lee et al 2009 dash et al 2008 2010 2015 organic micro pollutants baumgarten et al 2011 bertelkamp et al 2014 grünheid et al 2005 huntscha et al 2013 scheurer et al 2012 schmidt et al 2007 storck et al 2012 natural organic matter nom pesticides and pharmaceuticals miettinen et al 1994 doussan et al 1997 kuehn and mueller 2000 ray et al 2002 verstraeten et al 2002 wang 2002 massmann et al 2003 salinity dillon et al 2002a b ray et al 2002 reported that temperature and turbidity are the physical contaminants of the greatest concern as high temperature favours re growth of bacteria in distribution systems while high turbidity can negatively impact source water quality he also reported that turbidity can fluctuate significantly and is a concern for rivers that traverse through clay rich formations where the river water becomes loaded with colloidal and suspended particles such as clay metal hydroxo compounds from elements namely fe2 and mn2 according to pholkern et al 2015 the induced infiltration of river water through the river bank also creates a clogging layer this decreases river bank permeability and abstraction rates particularly if the river water has high turbidity sahoo et al 2005 illustrated the development and application of three types of artificial neural networks anns to estimate the effectiveness of two rbf facilities in the us the feed forward back propagation network bpn and radial basis function network rbfn model prediction results produced excellent agreement with measured data at a correlation coefficient above 0 99 for filtrate water quality parameters including temperature as well as turbidity heterotrophic bacteria and coliform removal saini et al 2013 studied that electrical conductivity ec and major ions were found to be more in production wells pw than the surface water river canal at rbf site at haridwar turbidity total and fecal coliform of water from the pws were not found to vary significantly during winter and spring months from the investigations on rbf at mathura singh et al 2010 it was found that the river water turbidity fluctuated significantly during the monitoring period 3 83 86 0 ntu however in the filtrate it remained less than 1 ntu ojha and thakur 2011 carried out a study to assess the variation of turbidity in the source water and the abstracted water at a river bank filtration site in haridwar and found that the turbidity removal coefficient varies with the natural logarithm of influent concentration of the source water from the studies done by the researchers it was found that rbf is effective in attenuating a wide variety of materials including turbidity natural organic matter pesticides pharmaceuticals taste and odour causing compounds etc the importance of environmental and hydraulic factors during rbf is also discussed however very few information is available as to how the aquifer characteristics are directly affecting water quality parameters during river bank filtration environmental factors which include different physical chemical and biological processes such as filtration biodegradation adsorption ion exchange ground water mixing and hydraulic factors such as detention time flow velocity affect the attenuation of pollutant during passage of surface water through the aquifer during river bank filtration the pollutant removal is dependent on various hydrogeological factors which need to be studied therefore a study was undertaken with an objective to evaluate the performance of river bank filtration in attenuating major surface water pollutants i e turbidity in different aquifer condition which will assist in selection of proper rbf site before execution of the project 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental investigation 2 1 1 materials soil sample was collected at a depth of 5 m below ground level 0 5 m below ground water level in the aquifer lying within the bank of kharala river of sambalpur district odisha the soil samples collected at this depth is representative of the soil layer of the aquifer grain size distribution of the aquifer sample was done according to is 2720 1985 the properties of the aquifer material are given in table 1 2 1 2 flow condition column experiments on aquifer soil compacted at field density and moisture content were carried out for the above investigation two different column setup having columns of 3 8 cm internal diameter and 120 cm height made up of perspex sheets were used for the continuous column studies i e a regulated flow set up to maintain different detention time b gravity flow set up to maintain different operation time schematic diagram of continuous column set up for regulated flow and gravity flow is shown at fig 1 a and b respectively feeding inlet water was passed fed into each column from the top to bottom and the percolated outlet water was collected at the bottom sampling port overflow pipe was provided at top of the soil layer to prevent excessive hydraulic build up on top of column for regulated flow different column experiments were conducted for different detention time for a single packed bed material soil detention time was measured by calculating the time taken td ve qe for a given amount of outlet water effluent to pass through the column at a given rate of effluent flow qe where effluent volume ve nvc is calculated by multiplying the volume of the soil column vc with porosity of the soil n different detention time was achieved by changing the effluent flow rate the effluent flow rate was maintained throughout the experiment by adjusting control valve and checked regularly with graduated measuring cylinder and timer the electrical conductivity ec of the effluent was measured continuously till it reached a constant value all the samples for further analysis were collected after the time equal to detention time has been elapsed as well as the electrical conductivity of the effluent attained a constant value influent flow rate qi was maintained at a range between 1 and 12 litres day for different packing materials and detention time for gravity flow single column experiment was conducted for different operation time for a single packed bed material soil operation time was measured by calculating the time elapsed from the time at which steady state is reached to the time at which sample was collected for the experiment flow was not controlled at the outlet and allowed to flow under gravity influent flow rate was maintained at a range between 5 and 15 liters day for different packing materials percolated water samples were collected at different operation time and analyzed for turbidity and electrical conductivity 2 1 3 packed bed materials packed bed materials used for the studies were a aquifer material in situ soil and b modified aquifer materials for the study with aquifer material the disturbed soil collected from the field was oven dried at 105 c for 24 h and then it was compacted in the perspex column at field moisture content to the field density for the study to find the effect of bed depth and hydraulic gradient aquifer material collected from the field was used as packed bed material and the height of the aquifer material was varied from 25 to 85 cm hydraulic gradients varied from 1 12 to 1 4 in order to simulate and study the effect of distance of collector well from river bank as well as hydraulic gradient for the study to find the effect of fine content the collected aquifer materials having fine content of 7 5 was taken as packed bed material for one column experiment for other five column experiments modified aquifer materials were taken as packed bed materials where dry sample for modified aquifer materials was prepared with varying fine content from 9 5 to 17 5 with increments of 2 for the study to find the effect of particle size the collected aquifer materials having mean particle size i e d50 0 3 mm was taken as packed bed material for one column experiment for other three column experiments modified aquifer materials were taken as packed bed materials where dry sample for modified aquifer materials was prepared from in situ soil by sieving it to three different sizes i e i coarse sand having size between 4 75 mm and 2 mm d50 3 mm ii medium sand having size between 2 mm 0 425 mm d50 0 92 mm and iii fine sand having size between 0 425 mm 0 075 mm d50 0 17 mm for each column experiments packed bed materials were compacted at field moisture content in the perspex column to the field density all the experiments were performed at room temperature and in saturated conditions for each packed bed material the experiments were carried out for both flow conditions i e regulated and gravity flow 2 1 4 feeding water water used for feeding was mixture of water from river kharla and ground water collected from a well nearest to river kharla for additional artificial turbidity fuller s earth was added to feeding water water of electrical conductivity 325 15 μs cm turbidity 30 120 ntu was fed to the column filled with different type of packed bed material as explained earlier 2 1 5 sample collection contaminated water was allowed to flow through soil column percentage reduction in turbidity was computed and its variation with change in geotechnical properties and hydraulic characteristics were noted down electrical conductivity and turbidity were measured for both inlet and outlet water samples all the experiments were conducted twice by collecting the percolated water effluent in duplicate after passing through different packed bed material for different detention time for regulated flow and different operation time for gravity flow 2 2 modelling a multiple regression analysis using statistical software package minitab 2017 was used to obtain an expression that correlates turbidity removal to ordinary soil properties stepwise regression was used to run the model in order to determine the most salient soil properties governing the equation related to turbidity removal computation multiple linear regression was then engaged to determine a linear equation which was used to compute turbidity removal based on the vital soil properties as discussed earlier 2 3 field studies field studies were carried out at two water supply schemes in the state of odisha india where rbf system is in place water samples were collected from the existing production wells which are getting water through rbf as well as from the rivers 2 3 1 study area first water supply scheme is located at river rushikulya fig 2 a of odisha state river water was collected through three production wells near the village badamadhapur of ganjam district and the extracted water is supplied to nearby berhampur town catering to a population of more than 0 3 million these three bore wells i e production wells pwr1 pwr2 and pwr3 having depth of 27 m and diameter of 5 m were installed in 1983 pwr1 pwr 2 and pwr3 are located at a distance of 27 100 and 45 m from river respectively second water supply scheme is located at river kharala fig 2 b at kuchinda town which is under sambalpur district in the state of odisha the city is located at 21 73 n 84 35 e it has an average elevation of 220 m three production wells were installed in 2010 on river kharala at kuchinda town the first production well pwk1 is of diameter 2 m depth 22 m and located on the right bank of the river within 3 m from river the river water filters through the horizontal perforated pipes laid 20 m below the river bank and collected in the production well the second pwk2 and third pwk3 production wells having diameter of 2 m and depth of 10 m is located at 290 m and 350 m from the river water from production wells is supplied to the kuchinda town 2 3 2 sample collection study was carried out in twelve phases water samples were collected during summer i e pre monsoon season march may monsoon june august and post monsoon september november periods in the year 2016 and 2017 number of samples being four in each period in a year water samples were collected from two different locations at river rushikulia rwr1 and rwr2 surface water three production wells pwr1 pwr2 and pwr3 river bank filtered water and two deep bore wells at a distance of more than 5 km from the river gwr1 and gwr2 ground water at badmadhabpur fig 2 a similarly water samples were collected from two different locations at river kharala rwk1 and rwk2 surface water three production wells pwk1 pwk2 and pwk3 river bank filtered water and two deep bore wells at a distance of more than 7 5 km from the river gwk1 and gwk2 ground water at kuchinda fig 2 b hydro geological relationship between production wells and river for both study areas is shown at fig 3 the aquifer at both study sites comprises stream deposits to a depth of 31 m badmadhabpur and 15 m kuchinda below ground and sediments ranging from fine sand and silt to medium sand and gravel the aquifers can be described as a single layer system which is in direct hydraulic contact with the river during low flow in the rivers during summer water level in the production wells get reduced and during high flow in the rivers during monsoon water level in the production wells get raised artificial pumping was done using the submersible pumps present inside the production wells in order to collect the water samples sampler was used to collect surface water samples from the upper layer of river water polyethylene bottles were used to collect the water samples the collection transportation preservation and analysis of the collected water samples were carried out in accordance with the procedures mentioned in the standard methods apha 2005 soil samples were collected every four meters during installation of bore well at river rushikulya and river kharala up to the depths of 12 m and 16 5 m respectively 2 4 methodology soil samples and water samples were analyzed in the geotechnical and environmental engineering laboratory of the department of civil engineering vssut burla soil samples were analyzed for grain size distribution using dry sieving in accordance with the approved procedures is 2720 and porosity of soil was also computed turbidity and sulphate concentration in water samples were determined using a nephelometer systronics 135 proper care was taken during the measurement of turbidity readings by ensuring low sedimentation rate and avoiding formation of air bubble in the samples ph and electrical conductivity were measured using ph and conductivity meters conductivity 720 systronics 306 and orion stara 2145 germany considering the effort to minimise the error due to temperature and other environmental parameters respectively chloride was measured using titration method 3 results and discussions 3 1 column studies soil column tests were performed to study leaching aspect of aquifer material and removal of turbidity due to different processes taking place during passage of river water through aquifer material all the experiments were conducted by collecting the percolated water after passing through aquifer and modified aquifer material for different detention time i e 1 8 h for regulated flow and different operation time i e 1 8 h for gravity flow 3 1 1 effect of detention time and operation time to study the effect of detention time and operation time a series of experiments were conducted with in situ soil as aquifer material having fine content 7 5 d50 0 3 mm soil bed depth 25 cm and hydraulic gradient 1 4 the results are presented in fig 4 which shows the effect of detention time and operation time on removal of turbidity from the filtrate collected at the outlet of aquifer material from fig 4 it can be observed that with increase in detention time as well as operation time the removal of turbidity increases the mean removal efficiency of turbidity increased from 70 in detention time of 1 h 87 6 in 7 h no significance increase was observed after 7 h of detention time the removal efficiency with respect to detention time was not linear removal rate was higher in 1 h detention time and the rate of increase in removal efficiency decreased with increase in detention time when suspended and colloidal materials are transported by a liquid flowing through porous media they are removed by various mechanisms such as straining in the contact zones of adjacent pores sedimentation in the pores interception higher removal rate at lower detention time may be attributed to straining in the contact zones of adjacent pores however with increase in detention time decrease in flow rate the mechanism which seems to be predominate is sedimentation in the pores garg 2013 corapcioglu and haridas 1984 from fig 4 further it can be observed that removal efficiency increases with increase in operating time this increase may be due to decrease in flow rate nearly 40 65 drop in flow rate with passage of time due to clogging and formation of filter cake colmation layer on the solid surface of top sand the physical straining process and inter particle attraction were improved due to the formation of filter cake ngai and walewijk 2003 studied the effect of filter cake and concluded that the formation of filter cake can be a significant cause of bacterial and turbidity removal in sand filters it is observed that as compared to the effect of operation time the effect of detention time is more significant in the removal efficiency fig 5 shows the effect of detention time and operation time on electrical conductivity ec of in situ soil leaching potential of in situ soil with respect to detention time was studied by measuring ec in the percolated water at different detention time as well as operation time from fig 5 it can be observed that the ec increases almost at a constant rate with increase in the detention time up to 7 h beyond which it remains constant ec at 7hr detention time was found to be 419 μs cm increase in ec with detention time may be due to leaching of dissolved solids most of the leaching took place during initial detention times similar effect was observed for operation time however the variation of electrical conductivity with operation time is less as compared to that with detention time from fig 5 it was observed that ec increases with increase in operation time up to 6 h beyond which no further leaching occurred i e soil column is fully leached in 6 h maximum ec value was found at 6 h running time i e 383 μs cm from fig 6 it can be observed that the discharge decreases with operation time the discharge goes on decreasing due to gradual clogging of voids in the soil by the suspended solids with turbid water flow the decrease in discharge indicates that the permeability of the soil decreases with the flow of water due to the clogging clogging mainly occurs due to the presence of suspended solids in water the discharge at 8 h of operation time was observed to be 5 67 l d where influent flow rate was 15 l d 3 1 2 effect of fine content to study the effect of fine content on turbidity removal efficiency electrical conductivity and discharge modified aquifer material with various fine contents were prepared as explained earlier six different soil columns were used with different fine percentages keeping other influencing parameters constant d50 0 3 mm soil bed depth 25 cm and hydraulic gradient 1 4 fig 7 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time respectively on removal of turbidity in aquifer material and modified aquifer material having different percentage of fines the result shows that the fine content has a significant effect on the removal efficiency of turbidity it is also observed that for all types of aquifer material with increase in detention time as well as operation time the removal efficiency of turbidity has increased from fig 7 a it can be observed that for 1 h detention time the maximum removal of turbidity i e 86 occurs at modified aquifer materials having 17 5 fines minimum removal of turbidity for detention time of 1 h i e 70 was observed for the aquifer material having fine percentage of 7 5 similarly maximum removal of turbidity i e 100 occurs at modified aquifer materials having 15 5 as well as 17 5 fines at the detention time of 7 h and 6 h respectively minimum removal of turbidity for detention time of 8hrs i e 87 6 is observed for the aquifer material having fine percentage of 7 5 for all types of aquifer material the removal rate was higher in lower detention time and rate of increase in removal efficiency decreased with increase in detention time from the figure it can also be observed that maximum removal efficiency is achieved at detention time close to 6 h after which no significant improvement in turbidity removal was observed particularly for higher fine percentage experiments it is also observed that as the detention time increases increase rate of efficiency with fine content decreases especially after 4 h detention time from fig 7 b it can be observed that the minimum removal efficiency is 62 4 corresponding to 1 h operation time and 7 5 fine content with increase in operation time for the same aquifer material the removal efficiency has increased to 79 2 at operation time of 8 h similarly with increase in fine from 7 5 to 17 5 the increase in efficiency was found to be 19 6 for operation time of 1 h and 18 5 for operation time of 8 h from the figure it can also be observed that removal efficiency at 8 h operation time for aquifer material having 7 5 fine 79 2 is less than the removal efficiency at 1 h operation time for aquifer material having 17 5 fine 82 it means that aquifer material having more fine percentage is prone to clogging at an early stage thereby reducing the rate of discharge and increasing the removal efficiency presence of higher percentage of fines increased the physical straining of turbidity producing suspended and colloidal materials thereby increasing the removal efficiency fig 8 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time on ec in aquifer and modified aquifer material having different percentage of fines from the figures it can be observed that the ec increases with increase in the percentage of fines for both regulated flow and gravitational flow presence of finer material increases the extent of mineralization from the aquifer material which results in increase in ec it can also be observed that maximum increase in ec takes place at initial detention and initial operation times at lower fine content 7 5 13 5 no increase in ec was observed after 7 8 h of detention time or operation time but at higher fine content the change of ec was observed till 10 11 h of detention time or operation time the change in ec depends on the rate of water flow duration for which water is held up in the aquifer composition of the aquifer material and the quality of infiltrating water dash et al 2010 fig 9 shows the effect of fine content on discharge rate it can be observed that the quantity of water collected in every 1 h decreases with increase in fine content this is due to clogging of pores of soil mass by the suspended solids present in the water the decrease in discharge signifies the decrease in permeability of soil increase in detention time and increase in removal efficiency of turbidity 3 1 3 effect of bed depth and hydraulic gradient experiments were conducted on soil columns of aquifer material varying only soil bed depth and hydraulic gradient the soil bed depths of 25 40 55 70 85 cm were used under hydraulic gradients of 1 4 1 25 1 18 1 14 1 12 respectively five different columns were used for five different soil bed depths and hydraulic gradient keeping other parameters constant d50 0 3 mm fine content 7 5 hydraulic gradient is computed by dividing the total height causing the flow sum of soil bed depth and water depth above it to soil bed depth fig 10 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time on removal of turbidity in aquifer material having different bed depths and hydraulic gradients from fig 10 a it can be observed that with increase in bed depth and decrease in hydraulic gradient turbidity removal efficiency increased for different detention times similar observations were made for the experiments with different operation time as shown in fig 10 b from fig 10 a the minimum and maximum turbidity removal efficiencies are observed to be 70 occurring at 1 h detention time for the soil depth of 25 cm and 99 occurring at detention time of 7 h for a soil depth of 85 cm respectively with increase in detention time for the soil depth of 25 cm the removal efficiency increased to 87 6 detention time of 7hr similarly with increase in soil depth from 25 cm to 85 cm the increase in efficiency was observed to be 11 5 at detention time of 1 h and 11 4 at detention time of 7 h from the figure it can also be observed that maximum removal efficiency is achieved near 7hr detention time for different soil depths after which no significant improvement was observed maximum rate of turbidity removal takes place for the soil column with minimum soil depth and minimum detention time but with increase in depth of soil column and detention time the removal efficiency is observed to increase at a lower rate the turbidity removal efficiency with respect to depth was found to be non linear so it could be concluded that removal efficiency was dependent upon the bed depth as well as flow rate detention time from fig 10 b it can be observed that for 1 h operation time the maximum removal of turbidity i e 85 occurs at soil depth of 85 cm minimum removal of turbidity for operation time of 1 h i e 62 4 is observed for soil depth of 25 cm similarly maximum removal of turbidity i e 96 5 occurs at soil depth of 85 cm at the detention time of 6 h minimum removal of turbidity for detention time of 6 h i e 79 is observed for the soil depth of 25 cm with increase in soil depth the removal efficiency of turbidity increases but the rate of increase in removal efficiency decreased with increase in bed depth higher removal efficiency was observed at initial depths this may be due to the fact that most of physical straining and majority of biological processes takes place in the first few centimetres of the filtration depth biological processes include metabolic breakdown predation scavenging natural death and inactivation haarhoff and cleasby 1991 it is also observed that as the soil height is increased the time taken to saturate the entire soil mass increases the turbidity removal also increases with the height as the void space available is more with the increased soil height the suspended solids thus get clogged in the available void spaces and hence the removal efficiency increases with the increase in the soil height the increase in bed depth contributes to better filtration as greater surface area provides a more intimate contact between the constituents of the raw water thus speeding up chemical reactions surface catalysis huisman and wood 1974 similar observation has been made for slow sand filter where research confirmed that the majority of biological processes occur in the top 0 4 m of the sand bed logsdon 1991 further during river bank filtration bacterial transport in soil and other unconsolidated or consolidated materials depends strongly on material properties in fine sand the migration of bacteria and suspended solids is limited and most of the bacteria and suspended solids are removed at the beginning of infiltration many within the first 0 5 m bellamy et al 1985 preuss 1996 albrechtsen et al 1998 fig 11 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time on conductivity at different soil depth and hydraulic gradient it can be observed that the ec is increasing with the increase in bed height soil depth it clearly indicates that with increase in soil height the amount of clay in soil and the dissolved solids in water increases resulting in more leaching and more ec fig 12 shows the effect of soil bed height hydraulic gradient on discharge it is observed that the quantity of water collected in every hour goes on decreasing as the suspended solids get clogged in the void spaces of the soil masses as the height of soil column increases the retention time of water in the soil increases resulting a more travel time to deliver the required quantity of water so for the given time interval when the soil height goes on increasing the discharge reduces considerably 3 1 4 particle size for the experiments aquifer material and modified aquifer material having different particle size i e in situ soil d50 0 3 mm coarse sand having size between 4 75 mm and 2 mm d50 3 mm medium sand having size between 2 mm 0 425 mm d50 0 92 mm and fine sand having size between 0 425 mm 0 075 mm d50 0 17 mm was used four different columns were used for four different particle size where other parameters are kept constant fine content 7 5 soil bed depth 25 cm and hydraulic gradient 1 4 fig 1 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time on removal of turbidity in aquifer material and modified aquifer material having different particle size d50values for the regulated flow fig 13 a maximum removal efficiency of 93 was achieved at detention time of 8 h for the fine sand however no significant change was observed after 6 h detention time where the removal efficiency is 89 minimum removal occurs in case of coarse fraction and is 74 at 8 h detention time removal efficiency at 1 h detention time for fine sand is almost same that of 8hr detention time of coarse sand from fig 13 b it can be observed that for the coarse sand the removal efficiency was minimal with minimum efficiency of 51 and maximum efficiency of 66 7 similarly in the medium sand the minimum removal efficiency was 60 1 and maximum removal efficiency was 88 7 and in the fine fraction the maximum removal efficiency is 92 8 which occurs after 8 h of operation time maximum removal efficiency was taking place at initial operation time from the study it was found that column having fine fraction performed better than those having medium and coarse fraction similar results are found by jenkins et al 2009 where he found that filters using finer sand d10 of 0 17 mm performed significantly better in terms of turbidity bacteria and virus removal than filters using coarser sand d10 of 0 52 mm research done by logan et al 2001 on intermittent sand filter columns of 60 cm sand revealed that fine grained sand columns d10 of 0 16 mm effectively removed cryptosporidium oocysts under the variety of conditions examined coarse grained media columns d10 0 90 mm yielded larger numbers of oocysts which were commonly observed in the effluent regardless of operating conditions laszlo and literathy 2002 found that the pollutant removal dilution rate depends on the raw water composition porous filtration medium properties and biogeochemical processes during infiltration fig 14 a and b shows the effect of detention time and operation time on ec for different particle sizes from both figures it can be observed that for modified aquifer soil the leaching is much more than the in situ soil this may be due to presence of similar sized soil particles in modified soil higher coefficient of uniformity i e cu value poorly graded soil in comparison to in situ soil where it has soil particles of different sizes lower cu value well graded soil for the modified aquifer soil higher ec was observed for fine sand this is due to presence of greater surface area in fine sand which provides more intimate contact between the water and soil particles thus speeding up chemical reactions and there by increasing leachability of the soil huisman and wood 1974 fig 15 shows the effect of variation in particle sizes on discharge from the graph it could be concluded that the discharge has decreased with the decrease in the particle sizes 3 1 5 modelling variation in soil properties results in deviation in turbidity removal achieved by various soil specimens regression tool like multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that four soil parameters were vital as far as determination of turbidity removal by the soil is concerned these four parameters are fine content hydraulic gradient d50 and detention time as mentioned in table 2 the equation describing the relationship between the turbidity removal and these four soil parameter is given below 1 turbidity removal 112 96 0 8491 fine content 34 81 hydraulic gradient 4 731 d50 2 6457 detention time regression analysis helped in correlating the turbidity removal by the soil samples with the soil parameter strongly r2 0 9588 it suggests that nearly 90 of the variability in turbidity removal could be described by fine hydraulic gradient average particle size d50 and detention time table 2 as p values for the independent variables were all 0 05 hence the above four parameter model was statistically rigorous at the 95 confidence level from the above observations it is noted that the independent variable like soil parameters considerably contribute to prediction of dependent variable like turbidity removal there was no significant collinearity between independent variable as indicated by the variance inflation factor vif table 2 multi collinearity was not seen in the variables and the parameter estimates are reliable because values for vif are 1 or slightly larger vif is less than four hence collinearity is not an issue both constant variance test and normality test were successfully passed by the model as shown in fig 16 and fig 17 this model suggests that turbidity removal percentage is enhanced by parameters like fine content hydraulic gradient and detention time with increase in fine of a given soil sample the specific surface area of soil particles increases as a result of which more surface area is available for more sorption of particles hence turbidity removal percentage increases the percentage of fine particles and the mean size of particles were included in the model because these parameters may directly affect the settling velocity of the particles in suspension during the movement of particles in the voids of soil samples as soil depth increases it has a tendency to increase the number of clogged layers as a result of which successive clogging takes place hence turbidity removal increases it can be observed from table 2 that out of four hydrogeological factors detention time is the most critical parameter in turbidity removal process with increase in detention time there will be enhancement of the sedimentation process of the suspended particles present in water into the micro pores mesopores as well as macro pores of the aquifer causing more particles to settle it can also be seen that hydraulic gradient had a negative effect on turbidity removal as with increase in hydraulic gradient the flow of water is increasing as a result of which there is reduction in turbidity removal percentage 3 2 field studies the values for some of the water quality parameters for the samples collected at each location in different periods are presented in table 3 water from both rivers i e rushikulya and kharala have more turbidity in monsoon period in comparison to non monsoon periods and having turbidity 20 50 times more than that of non monsoonal although the river water turbidity fluctuated significantly during the sampling period 4 198 ntu the turbidity of the production well water i e rbf was below 2 ntu as the river water passes through the aquifer the water gets filtered and most of the turbidity and organics are removed ray et al 2002 reduction in turbidity in the water samples collected from the production wells were significant fig 18 a the water from production wells showed 2 0 2 2 log reduction of turbidity in monsoon period 0 6 1 3 log reduction of turbidity in pre monsoon period and 1 0 1 36 log removal of turbidity in post monsoon period the fate and transport of suspended and colloidal particles in the subsurface were controlled by several processes including advection dispersion physicochemical filtration straining and dilution of these physicochemical filtration plays a significant role in the removal of turbidity from the river water during the passage to the pws dash et al 2015 water from the river gets mineralized as it flows through the aquifer to the production wells the ratio of electrical conductivity in pws to surface water for different periods are shown in fig 18 b indicating maximum concentration of dissolved solids in pwk 3 as it is located at a greater distance from the river bank mean values of electrical conductivity of river water at first study site was 200 μs cm in monsoon period and 306 μs cm in non monsoon period whereas for water from pw it was 293 μs cm in monsoon period and 445 μs cm in non monsoon period similarly mean values of electrical conductivity of river water at second study site was 118 μs cm in monsoon period and 178 μs cm in non monsoon period whereas for water from pw it was 197 μs cm in monsoon period and 231 μs cm in non monsoon period this may be due to the mixing of groundwater and infiltrated surface water from the river another reason may be due to weathering and or leaching of materials from the deposits into the percolated water dash et al 2010 water from the rivers production wells and deep ground water were analysed for cl and so4 2 so as to use them as natural tracer davis et al 1980 gu et al 2008 for finding the proportion of river water in the production wells ground water contains highest amount cl and so4 2 content which is followed by production wells and then river water the river bank filtered water is a mixture of surface water and ground water shamrukh and wahab 2008 from the cl and so4 2 data for production wells ground water and river water given in table 3 it can be observed that of river water in pws water is more in monsoon season and of river water is less in pws water in summer season because of availability of higher hydraulic gradient in monsoon season as maximum river water flow occurs when compared to river water flow in other seasons grain size analysis carried out as per indian soilclassification is 1498 1970 was used for estimating hydraulic conductivity table 4 and found to be in the range of 45 72 m day average 51 m day for study site 1 and in range of 33 62 m day average 45 m day for study site 2 the travel time detention time between the screens of the production wells and the surface water is an important parameter for bacteria and turbidity removal dash et al 2008 for this study darcy s law was used to compute the travel time by the measured water level of the river as well as of production wells assuming that the river water percolates at the bed using the calculated detention time hydraulic gradient fine percentage and d50 values in equation 1 turbidity removal at field condition was estimated and given in table 5 it can be observed that with the field condition the turbidity removal should be 100 where as actual field observation indicates turbidity removal of more than 99 in the most of the seasons except pre monsoon or summer season less turbidity removal was observed during the non monsoon period as river water contains less turbidity during this period less than 5 ntu 4 conclusion effect of different aquifer characteristics i e percentage fine soil bed depth hydraulic gradient grain size d50 as well as different hydraulic characteristics such as detention time and operation time on turbidity removal as well as on electrical conductivity was established through column studies and through regression model removal of turbidity during field studies indicate the effectiveness of river bank filtration in actual field condition where as the laboratory column studies provide insight in to the importance of different hydrogeological properties responsible for achieving the same from the study it can be concluded that turbidity removal efficiency and electrical conductivity increased with increase in detention and operation time increase in percentage fine increase in soil bed depth and decrease in grain size and hydraulic gradient similar results were observed in multiple linear regression analysis for hydrogeological parameters such as fine content hydraulic gradient mean grain size d50 and detention time for various aquifer conditions having different values of hydrogeological parameters turbidity removal efficiency can be calculated using multiple linear regression equation used in the present investigation this will definitely assist in optimising the location of production wells for different river sites having rbf system in place or having potential for developing the rbf system optimum distance of production well from the river can be calculated after optimising the location of production wells in case the production well is located at a distance more than the optimum distance the pumping cost will be high whereas if it is located at a distance less than the optimum desired turbidity removal efficiency cannot be achieved 
12217,a novel continuous flow electrolysis elc system comprised of non corrosive platinum anode and stainless steel cathode electrodes was proposed to remove fluoride f and elements that cause hardness magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 and alkalinity causing ions carbonates co3 2 and bicarbonates hco3 from naturally contaminated groundwater performances and ion removal mechanisms of the proposed system were studied with the effect of charge loading in electrolyte c l and initial ion concentrations in synthetic groundwater experimental results were used to design and build a community level treatment facility in the anuradhapura district sri lanka where high f elements causing hardness and alkalinity are found in the groundwater it was noticed that the proposed elc system water recovery 100 was capable of removing a significant amount of f by adsorption to the calcite caco3 phase and co precipitating with amorphous mg oh 2 the chemical composition of precipitation demonstrated that 6 9 mol of mg2 can remove 1 mol of f ions at higher charge loading 500 1500 c l for the initial levels of f 10 ca2 100 mg2 100 mg l and hco3 co3 2 9 42 mmol l it was found that a maximum of 57 of f 61 of mg2 94 of ca2 and 82 of hco3 co3 2 were effectively removed by the system moreover the proposed system exhibited the capability of disinfecting the final water as an extra advantage however system efficiencies of contaminant removal varied with the varying initial mg2 co3 2 hco3 co3 2 and charge loading the water quality data from the community level elc plant established shows that the proposed system was competent for the removal of f mg2 ca2 hco3 and co3 2 ions from groundwater to meet desirable standard levels as a simple robust and economical technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrolysis fluoride hardness charge loading 1 introduction groundwater is a major requisite drinking water source in the world and its contamination has been an issue due to the presence of various pollutants such as fluoride f elements causing hardness and heavy metals even though f is essential for humans for preventing dental and skeletal caries excess intake is detrimental to human health browne et al 2005 iano et al 2014 mandinic et al 2010 tiwari et al 2017 ayoob and gupta 2006 the acceptable safe limit of f recommended by the world health organization who is 1 5 mg l who 2017 hardness in water is caused by a variety of dissolved polyvalent metallic ions predominantly calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 cations the degree of hardness of drinking water is important for aesthetic acceptability such as palatability odor appearance and color hardness does not have a direct adverse effect on human health however it is troublesome for industries as well as households causing scaling on equipment pipelines storage tanks etc degrees of hardness are categorized as soft moderately hard hard and very hard according to the following range of equivalent caco3

removing f electrochemical methods have been proven as an effective way of treating polluted water de francesco and costamagna 2004 martínez huitle et al 2006 pulkka et al 2014 moreover mg2 and ca2 ions removal as calcite caco3 and brucite mg oh 2 minerals in the presence of hco3 ion by electrochemical methods in the vicinity of electrochemical generation of oh ion in the cathode was reported zeppenfeld 2011 common electrochemical methods are categorized as electrocoagulation eco electrochemical reduction electrochemical oxidation indirect electro oxidation with strong oxidants and photo assisted electrochemical methods brillas and martínez huitle 2015 among those methods eco has a long history as a water wastewater treatment technology that has been widely employed to remove a wide range of pollutants such as f organic dyes hardness and heavy metals nidheesh and singh 2017 sandoval et al 2014 zuo et al 2008 in eco the most commonly used technique for f and hardness removal sacrificial electrodes corrode to release active coagulant precursors usually aluminum or iron cations to form a metal hydroxide coagulant anode passivation and sludge deposition on the electrodes inhibiting the electrolysis process over time as well as the production of high amounts of iron and aluminum ions dissolved in the effluent are the main disadvantages of eco brillas et al 2003 but the lack of a systematic approach to the eco reactor design its operation and issues of electrode reliability particularly the passivation of the electrodes over time have further limited its implementation as a safe drinking water treatment holt et al 2005 recent technical improvements combined with a growing need for small scale decentralized water treatment facilities have led to a re invention of eco besides eco was identified as an emerging technique for the defluoridation of drinking water and industrial wastewater because of its versatility environmental compatibility and its significant process efficiency mollah et al 2001 by overcoming the disadvantages articulated developing an operational level eco treatment system to challenge other predominant treatment technologies such as reverse osmosis electrodialysis and adsorptive technologies is of greater interest to researchers however the challenge of developing such a system using only eco technology is problematic especially due to limited electrode materials electrolysis was found to be a well established electrochemical technology for cl2 g production but to date its use for drinking water treatment or f removal has not been reported but several studies presented that ca2 co3 2 and hco3 could effectively remove by electrolysis and electrochemical methods hasson et al 2010 zeppenfeld 1998 therefore in this work a novel continuous flow electrolysis elc system composed of non passivated platinum and stainless steel electrodes was used to remove f and elements causing hardness using natural water containing mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 ions the removal of f mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 was studied furthermore mechanisms of ion removal and process optimization were studied for different levels of operational and contaminate levels real groundwater treatment efficiencies system stability and laboratory prepared synthetic groundwater treatment efficiencies were compared to validate results by

alpha radiation configuration 2theta min 30 kv 15 ma 450 w voltage logging was performed with onset hobo data logger due to the diprotic nature of carbonic acid h2co3 in the solution both co3 2 and hco3 ions are available and their concentrations would change with the solution ph therefore the sum of the carbonates hco3 and co3 2 concentrations hereafter hco3 co3 2 as mmol l was accounted for the alkalinity water samples hco3 co3 2 s charge was calculated by accounting system s ion charge balances the tracer ion concentrations were neglected and major ions were concerned in the calculation

storage and quality control a groundwater source located in the sri lanka the medawachchiya area 8 32 02 8 n 80 29 57 6 e the anuradhapura district was selected to perform the filed study water samples from the field and the laboratory were filtered to the 50 ml polyethylene bottles on location by using a membrane filter with a 0 45 μm pore size to eradicate bacteriological activities affecting the water quality and to remove the non dissolved particles the collected water samples from the field were transported to japan and analyzed within the 45 days of its collection laboratory samples were analyzed within one week of its collection appropriate dilutions and analysis were performed for the cation and anion with ion chromatograph by analyzing the calibration standard solution after each 20 samples the stability of the ion chromatographic detector was monitored for the quality control overall concentration variability of the examined calibration standard solution were obtained below the 5 or otherwise re analysis was performed 2 3 experimental setup of the elc cell an acrylic material tank having dimensions of 20 cm 10 5 cm 5 cm length height width was used as an elc reactor for the laboratory experiments the tank was separated into two cells with a 4 mm thick effective area 20 cm 10 5 cm permeable clay diaphragm the diaphragm helps to separate anode and cathode solutions prevents the mixing of sludge formed in the cathode and facilitates the exchange of ions between cells to lengthen the water flow in each cell individual cells were further divided into two equal slots with a acrylic plate keeping open 10 mm from the bottom effective volumes of the cathode and anode cells were 525 ml and 420 ml respectively u shaped platinum pt effective length 30 cm φ 0 40 mm and stainless steel ss effective length 30 cm φ 1 00 mm wires were used as electrodes for anodes and cathodes respectively the inter electrode distance was kept at 3 3 cm the assembly was connected to a constant current power supply for all experiments the elc cell configuration is shown in fig 1 2 4 unit treatment steps and operational description the experimental setup employed for the laboratory experiments is shown in fig 2 it describes an elc system comprised of a hco3 co3 2 removal configuration in which an aerator was utilized this system circulates anode bath water with a lower ph to remove hco3 co3 2 at both the anode and the aerator as carbon dioxide co2 eq 7 and is able to treat 100 of the water quantity for the experiments a series of f mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 spiked tap water as synthetic groundwater was continuously pumped to the elc reactor by applying a constant current to the immersed ss and pt electrodes as electrolysis progressed water molecules acquired electrons to form oh ions in the cathode cell causing high ph eq 8 while h ions generated in the anode cell caused a low ph environment eq 6 the majority of ions were removed at the cathode eqs 9 12 its higher ph environment starts precipitating co precipitating the mg2 f ca2 and hco3 co3 2 ions could involve in removing f eq 13 16 as a final treatment step a roughing sand filter was

mechanisms in the electrochemical process of removing f mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 key parameters that affect ion removal efficiencies include the current applied and retention time therefore electrolysis time or charge loading a ls 1 c l and current density a m2 are important parameters which affect the process performances however in this study elc without sacrificial electrodes was focused not on cost but on the treatment efficiency furthermore the amount of precipitates co precipitates and adsorbent produced in the process were proportional to the charge loading moreover charge loading is appropriate parameter for maintain performance when scaling to different treatment volumes hence the charge loading becomes the most important operational variables for describing elc treatment efficiency therefore in this section the effect of charge loading was described with the possible environmental contamination levels of f ca2 mg2 mg l and hco3 co3 2 mmol l in synthesized groundwater as reviewed by bhattacharya and samal 2018 and reported by kawakami et al 2014 the maximum f levels in groundwater in india japan nigeria brazil china and sri lanka were less than 10 mg l but in pakistan and indonesia maximum levels were exceeding the 14 mg l farooqui et al 2007 heikens et al 2005 accordingly this study was performed with the maximum f contamination level of 10 mg l the charge loading applied and respective current densities used a m2 current cross sectional area of the electrolyte between the anode and cathode were 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 c l and 2 38 4 76 7 14 9 52 11 9 14 29 a m2 respectively throughout the experiments system flow rates were kept constant 12 ml min in the cathode retention time 0 73 h and 8 ml min in the anode retention time 0 88 h variations of f cl na mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 removal percentages in cathode and anode baths for increasing charge loading are shown in fig 3 a b respectively note that the hco3 co3 2 removed in the system includes the hco3 co3 2 removed at the anode h ions reacting with hco3 co3 2 to form co2 g hco3 co3 2 removed at the aerator as co2 g by reacting with residual h ions from the anode and hco3 co3 2 precipitated as caco3 and mgco3 moreover the dilution of raw water hco3 co3 2 took place at the aerator by mixing with none or less hco3 co3 2 solution circulating through the anode according to fig 3a the removal of f and mg2 showed a steady but significant rise over that of the applied charge loading c l removal of ca2 showed a slight rise over that of the c l totaling more than 86 for the increasing c l hco3 co3 2 removals increased gradually at 250 c l the removal percentages of f and mg2 ions in the cathode bath were 20 and 16 respectively steadily reaching maximums of 57 and 61 at 1500 c l at 250 c l 55 of co3 2 hco3 had been removed gradually increasing to a maximum of 82 at 1500 c l the removal of both f and mg2 increased similarly with an increase of c l therefore there is an effect of f removed by the mg2 forming agents mg oh 2 mgco3 and mgf2 due to the alkaline nature in cathode obviously mg2 forms mg oh 2 and mgco3 precipitates an average of 92 of ca2 was removed showing a minimum of 87 and a maximum of 95 at 250 c l and 1500 c l respectively according to the hco3 and co3 2 equilibrium eq 5 a significant amount of co3 2 can be formed at a higher ph therefore the removal of more than 92 of ca2 was promised by forming caco3 precipitation in a high ph environment since both ca2 hco3 and co3 2 precursors were readily available table 1 summarizes the molar concentration of ion removal for co3 2 hco3 s carbon mg2 and ca2 for different c ls particularly h and oh were involved in removing the co3 2 hco3 s carbon as co2 and forms of precipitates caco3 and mgco3 respectively the h and oh introduced were calculated by assuming all electrons were contributed to form h and oh ions h oh coulomb ampere second faraday constant table 1 column 2 assuming that carbon removal only ensued by forming caco3 and co2 carbon removed as co2 was calculated table 1 column 6 from the difference between h and co2 it was found that the amounts of h remaining after forming co2 was higher than the calculated carbon removed as co2 except in 250 c l column 7 usually for the resulted carbon removal as co2 not equal but higher level of h concentrations are required since in reality all electrons were not involved in generating the h therefore at 250 c l the only plausible mechanism for the removal of 0 54 mmol l of carbon should be the formation of mgco3 precipitate furthermore the summation of mg2 removed and h introduced for 250 c l was higher than the co3 2 hco3 s carbon removed as other forms 2 59 0 71 3 30 mmol l hence it can be concluded that lower c l co3 2 hco3 s carbon removal occurred via the formation of mgco3 according to fig 3a and table 1 it is clear that the removal of mg2 as well as co3 2 hco3 carbon increased as the charge loading increased the increase of charge loading directly resulted in producing more h to remove co3 2 hco3 s carbon as co2 and supplementary oh ion to form mg oh 2 this also caused increased removal of both mg2 and co3 2 hco3 s carbon similarly increases of charge loading upsurge the formation of oh thus co3 2 ion according to the le chatlier s principle eq 9 which leads to higher growth of caco3 and mgco3 ions ksp value of the formation increase as mgco3 caco3 mg oh 2 therefore the concentrations of precipitation should be increase as mgco3 caco3 mg oh 2 if ion interferences were not occurred the ion removals in cathode mainly depends on the amount of mg2 and ca2 precipitated therefore by using the amount of mg2 and ca2 precipitated and applied coulomb the ion current efficiency η was calculated as shown in eq 17 assuming oh were not reacted with h in the cathode all the h were consumed by co3 2 hco3 to form co2 at the aerator and anode or no h oh ion transferred through diaphragm η precipitated magnesium mol l precipitated calcium mol l 100 generded hydroxyl mol l 17 η m g i n i t i a l m g e q u l i b r i u m 2 c a i n i t i a l c a e q u l i b r i u m 2 a p p l i e d c o u l o m b f a r a d a y c o n s t a n t 100 according to eq 17 calculated ion removal efficiencies for the 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 c l were 109 56 43 37 35 31 respectively the trend of lower removal efficiencies could be due to the decrease of precipitate precipitation reaching its equilibrium decrease of co3 2 hco3 species and electron unexploited such as oh consumed by hco3 to form co3 2 in alkaline condition and cl2 g production eq 18 in the anode according to fig 3b in an anode bath the removal of ca2 mg2 f and na was mostly stabilized over the varying c l while cl ion removal showed a significant negative decrease over the increasing c l the positive removal of f mg2 ca2 and na in the anode bath resulted from ion transportation to the cathode bath by a coulomb force and ion concentration gradient when the electrolysis continued ca2 mg2 and f ions were precipitated in the cathode bath creating an environment of lower ion concentration and creating an ion concentration gradient between the anode and cathode to balance the deficiency of the ions in the cathode solution both the ion concentration gradient and the encouraging coulomb force transport mg2 ca2 and na ions through the clay diaphragm by overcoming the encouraging coulomb force the ion concentration gradient alone transported f ion to the cathode bath which could be precipitated as caf2 mgf2 co precipitated with mg oh 2 or adsorbed by caco3 mgco3 mixture the stabilized ph variations over current densities after 24 h operation are presented in fig 3c a slight increase of ph in the cathode and a slight decrease of ph in both aerators can be observed for increasing charge loading as a result of an upsurge of oh and h ions respectively according to fig 3a b cl ion movement from the cathode to the anode by the coulomb force and an ion concentration gradient can be seen as negative and positive removal percentages respectively even though cl was not precipitated the removal of cl ions in the cathode bath increased slightly with increasing c l although it was not proportional to the amount transported from the anode this was rather strange as the disappearing cl ion should appear in the cathode bath in an increasing manner over the increasing c l the process of continuous water circulation and lower cl2 g evaporation cause that trend of incremental cl concentration in the cathode bath the formation of cl2 g byproducts in the anode eq 18 was an extra advantage of this system since water dissolved cl2 g produced hocl ion attributes for water disinfection lower ph level in the anode is favorable of dissociating cl2 g and hydrolysis into hocl at aerator is almost complete at aerator operational ph 5 furthermore by measuring the total chlorine data were not shown hear with dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 the presence of hocl was confirmed however the excessive level of chlorine may negatively affect the final water palatability if the water used for drinking purpose it was found that an increase in total chlorine over increasing c l it increased up to 35 mg l at 1500 c l which was far beyond the desirable level of chlorine at 0 2 mg l this level may be reduced based on the initial cl level and current applied to the water however prior to the consumption of treated water the excessive chlorine concentration should be reduced if it exceeds the limit water storage for a particular time with aeration and activated carbon filtration could be a reliable solution 18 2 c l a q c l 2 g 2 e table 2 summarizes the chemical composition of precipitates from different charge loading operations according to table 2 data approximately 6 9 mol of mg removed 1 mol of f at a higher charge loading 500 1500 c l however for a lower 250 c l 2 mol of mg removed 1 mol of f the ratio of molar to mass mol g of ca ion in the precipitate reduced but ratio of molar to mass mol g of mg ion increased with increasing c ls possibly forming the mg oh 2 carbon mol g in the precipitate decreases as ca decreases over increasing c l obviously presence of mg oh 2 in the precipitate cause this effect according to table 2 column 9 it seems that o h mg g was not enough for the balancing carbon precipitated 135 mg g as co3 2 at 250 c l total of 540 mg l oxygen required for balancing the 135 mg g carbon in precipitate during the precipitate drying process a minor amount of mg oh 2 caco3 and mgco3 can be converted to mgo and cao thus co2 and h2o can be released could cause such a deviation the xrd analysis of precipitates fig 4 show diffraction peaks of aragonite caco3 dominant phase and calcite ca mg co3 in agreement with earlier studies the presence of mg2 leads to the aragonite precipitation rather than thermodynamically favored calcite phase reddy and karin wang 1980 karoui et al 2013 however the presence of crystalline brucite mg oh 2 fluorite caf2 or sellaite mgf2 were not observed in the xrd spectrum nevertheless some broad diffraction peaks appeared in the xrd spectrum at higher current densities of 1000 1500 c l these peaks may be due to an amorphous or partially crystalline nature of mg oh 2 saoud et al 2014 reported in the previous study data that broad diffraction peaks 2θ degrees represented nano particles of mg oh 2 prepared by microwave assisted precipitation process fluoride precipitation with ca2 ion as caf2 s was a well known technology but xrd results revealed the absence of caf2 or mgf2 however removal of f by adsorption to the calcite was reported in several studies jain and jayaram 2009 turner et al 2005 therefore according to the chemical composition of the precipitate and xrd observations it can be concluded that f was removed by adsorption to the calcite phase at lower current densities for larger current densities both mg oh 2 particles and calcite involved in f removal the previous studies of de fluoridation of water using nano magnesium oxide suggested that f metathesis between mg oh 2 and f could occur due to the iso electric nature and similar size of f and oh ions devi et al 2012 oladoja et al 2016 furthermore co precipitation mechanism for f removal by mg oh 2 was proposed by nidheesh and singh 2017 as they described a sweep flocculation coagulation mechanism occurs in the presence of hydrolyzable metal cations here mg2 according to the xrd results all of the species formed could not be identified due to the amorphous nature of the precipitates and the low quantity of some species formed therefore by visual minteq freeware package ion speciation was modeled as shown in fig 5 for the initial levels of f mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 as 10 100 100 mg l and 10 mmol l respectively according to the speciation most dominate species formed in the elc operational ph range 9 12 were caco3 mgco3 and mg oh 2 in agreement with the xrd results furthermore visual minteq saturation index data revealed that in ph 8 aragonite caco3 calcite caco3 dolomite ca mg co3 2 fluorite caf2 huntite mg3 ca co3 4 magnesite mgco3 and in ph 12 aragonite artinite mg2 co3 oh 2 3h2o brucite mg oh 2 calcite dolomite fluorite huntite hydromagnesite mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o and magnesite mineral phases were saturated even though saturation index data showed the fluorite saturation in high ph levels the formation of caf was found negligible while the formation of mgf decreased with increasing ph level according to fig 5 furthermore the modeled speciation diagram did not show significant f removal as found in the elc experimental results thus simulated speciation results were unable to describe the f removal and complexation mechanism profoundly 3 2 effect of initial co3 2 hco3 on ion removal efficiencies as identified previously co3 2 hco3 inhibit the formation of mg oh 2 and f removal but they increase ca2 removal in order to have a comprehensive idea about how co3 2 hco3 influence the system s performance elc experiments were performed at 750 c l for the initial f 10 mg l ca2 100 mg l mg2 100 mg l and various co3 2 hco3 ranging 2 10 mmol l system flow rates were maintained at 12 ml min in the cathode contact time 0 73 h and 8 ml min in the anode contact time 0 875 h results obtained are summarized in fig 6 fig 6a b illustrates the removal of f cl na mg2 ca2 and co3 2 hco3 in the cathode bath and the respective ph variations in unit treatment steps according to fig 6a in the cathode bath the removal of the f and mg2 steadily decreased as the co3 2 hco3 increased while cl and na ion removal showed a slight incremental increase over the increasing hco3 for the 2 1 4 7 mmol l of the initial hco3 concentrations more than 96 of co3 2 hco3 were removed most of the co3 2 hco3 tended to be removed at the anode and the aerator by reacting with h eq 7 if we assumed that all h ions produced at 750 c l table 1 column 2 were reacted with co3 2 hco3 at the anode and the aerator a total of 7 77 mmol l of co3 2 hco3 should be removed as co2 g however as fig 6 data showed only 62 5 83 mmol l of co3 2 hco3 were removed for 9 41 mmol l of initial hco3 level even though removal of 77 7 7 31 mmol l was expected within the proposed elc system many minor reactions can occur therefore electrons unexploited for other reactions could be the reason for such decreases for the initial co3 2 hco3 levels of 2 1 9 4 mmol l the removal of 2 07 6 26 mmol l of co3 2 hco3 can be detected this level was lower than the h introduced 7 77 mmol l thus ensuring a high co3 2 hco3 removal as co2 moreover co3 2 hco3 were not removed only by h ions however lower h higher oh ca2 and mg2 led to the formation of caco3 and mgco3 in the cathode bath eqs 9 11 the removal of ca2 showed a significant incremental increase over the increasing co3 2 hco3 at the 2 1 mmol l co3 2 hco3 level ca2 removal was negative the absence of the co3 2 hco3 and coulomb transportation of ca2 ions to the cathode creates this phenomenon therefore maintaining an adequate amount of co3 2 hco3 was favorable for removing a significant amount of ca2 ions however it decreases the mg2 and f removal by consuming oh it is obviously lower co3 2 hco3 which increases mg2 and f removal in the absence or low concentrations of co3 2 hco3 in the cathode the formation of mg oh 2 was more favorable hence f co precipitation was enriched as shown in fig 6b ph variation in the cathode bath showed a slight decrease while the anode ph showed a slight increase conversely the aerator ph rapidly increases with increasing hco3 due to h ions insufficient for removing increasing co3 2 hco3 therefore for higher levels of initial co3 2 hco3 a higher level of operational charge loading is required to maximize both f and mg2 removal 3 3 effect of initial mg2 concentration on ion removal efficiencies in this section the influence of initial mg2 concentration on ion removal was described at 750 c l the initial levels of f 10 mg l ca2 100 mg l and co3 2 hco3 9 42 mmol l but with varying mg2 levels 0 100 mg l in synthetic groundwater were used for the experiments the flow rates of the system were maintained at 12 ml min in the cathode contact time 0 73 h and at 8 ml min in the anode contact time 0 875 h results obtained are summarized as line graphs as shown in fig 7 according to fig 7 more than 90 removal of ca2 can be observed for all levels of mg2 carbonate removal showed a slight increase from 57 to 60 for 0 100 mg l mg2 noticeably f removal showed a slight increase of 0 100 mg l for the initial mg2 range the removal of mg2 was found to increase 0 25 mg l for 0 100 mg l at initial mg2 levels therefore the amount of mg oh 2 formed was increased with respect to the initial mg2 concentration which leads to increased f co precipitation a slight increase of co3 2 hco3 but decrees in ca2 removal can be observed with increasing mg2 it is known that mg2 ions act to inhibit the crystal growth of caco3 the inhibition of caco3 growth by the presence of mg2 is caused by mg2 being incorporated in the original caco3 seed surface and developing a new crystal surface but not the mgco3 lin and singer 2009 zhang and dawe 2000 therefore in our system mg2 was not actively participating in the removal of co3 2 hco3 as mgco3 however the degree of ca2 removal with increasing mg2 indicates that a mg2 inhibit the formation of caco3 the calculated molar concentrations of h at 750 c l 7 77 mmol l the average carbonate removal 5 38 mmol l and the average ca2 removal 2 37 mmol l verify that most of the carbon from co3 2 hco3 removed by reacting with h were produced by an electrolysis reaction the rest of the carbon from co3 2 hco3 were removed as caco3 and mgco3 in higher and smaller proportions respectively the removal of na and cl showed degrees of increasing mg2 levels since we are using mgcl2 for synthetic water with increasing mg2 cl ion concentration increases therefore cl removal decreases 3 4 development and operation of a community level water treatment plant to remove f and elements causing hardness for the design and implementation for an operational scale water treatment plant a part of sri lanka was selected where naturally contaminated groundwater had become a threat to humans groundwater in the northern part of sri lanka was found to be rich in natural contaminants such as f mg2 ca2 and alkalinity at higher levels additionally people in the northern part of the country had chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu as well as dental and skeletal fluorosis due to high levels of f and other elements such as mg2 and ca2 chandrajith et al 2011 kawakami et al 2014 perera et al 2008 weragoda et al 2013 table 3 summarizes groundwater quality data from some of the selected districts in sri lanka kawakami et al 2014 the data shows that higher f concentrations are present along with significant amounts of mg2 ca2 and alkalinity accordingly a groundwater source located in the anuradhapura district the medawachchiya area location 8 32 02 8 n 80 29 57 6 e was selected for the installation of a community level treatment system with a production capacity of 374 l day resident time 0 77 h for both anode and cathode for the design a new laboratory system was adopted by combining an aeration unit inside the anode bath combining the anode with the aeration unit reduced the system complexity and the number of pumps to one while minimizing the power consumption and cost of building fig 8 as a power source a constant voltage power supply max 10 a was used by measuring the voltage across the resistor using data logger onset hobo the amperage was calculated two reactors made of a perspex acrylic material similar to the laboratory experimental elc reactor were utilized at the treatment plant the effective total volume of the anode and cathode was 12 l 28 cm 40 cm 5 357cm 2 pt wires 30 cm 2 and ss mesh 2 cm 2 cm were used as anode and cathode electrodes respectively the water quality of w w was shown in table 4 according to table 4 there was a high concentration of f in the well water exceeding the sri lankan maximum regularity limit of 1 mg l as well as the who limit of 1 5 mg l slsi 2013 who 2017 other ions concentrations also found at extremely high and did not fluctuate significantly during the operating period fig 9 shows the charge loading calculated at the sampling time for 59 days of continuous operation it was found that the charge loading and current densities were fluctuated 1143 1408 c l and 25 63 27 23 a m2 respectively the changes in well water ww quality are attributed to this fluctuation the water quality measured for raw water and water treated for a 59 day continuous operation is shown in fig 10 after being treated with the system the f concentration was reduced dramatically and became mostly stable during the operational period the f concentrations in treated water were found to be under both sri lankan and who regularity limits fig 10b shows the mg2 concentration of well water and treated water for 59 days of continuous operation there was a high concentration of mg2 in the well water exceeding the sri lankan maximum regularity limit of 30 mg l and it did not show significant fluctuations during the operating period except for three treated water samples samples showed a mg2 level lower than the sri lankan maximum regularity limit but all are lower than 40 mg l fig 9c shows the removal of ca2 ion and it demonstrates that ca2 ion was effectively removed by the system according to fig 9d extremely high hco3 levels were observed in the well water and the partial removal of co3 2 hco3 at the anode was observed as expected the partial removal of co3 2 hco3 leads to the removal of high quantities of ca2 the level of co3 2 hco3 as hco3 in the treated water was observed to be below 5172 μeq l to meet the desirable level of hco3 a much higher level of current should be applied however applying such a high current was not economically viable at the time but except co3 2 hco3 other ions were removed effectively by the system however the increase of charge loading further for the proposed system can meet that water quality target for f and hardness causing ions fig 10e shows the ph profile of ww and treated water fig 11 compares the averaged water quality data of the community level system with the laboratory experimental data it shows that the averaged ion removal efficiencies of f and mg2 were higher than the experimental values an initial f average 2 42 mg l concentration lower than the experimental level 10 mg l could be the reason for this higher removal the initial mg2 concentration in the community level treatment plant was slightly higher than that in the laboratory system 107 mg l however it demonstrated much more efficient removal ww average ca2 removal was found to be lower than the experimental value initial ww ca2 56 68 mg l and ca2 100 mg l but its removal was comparably much similar to the experimental removal as described previously mg2 ions act to inhibit the crystal growth of caco3 lin and singer 2009 zhang and dawe 2000 can attribute for such a decrease however results of the laboratory experimental study proposed cannot be used to predict the actual ion removal with the treatment system due to different initial ion concentrations fluctuating charge loading as well as reactor dissimilarities retention time aeration in anode etc therefore a significantly more complex mathematical model is required to predict the removal of f and other ions for initial ion concentrations c l retention time etc based on the water quality results of the community level plant and its distinct capabilities to remove f mg2 ca2 and hco3 ions smooth operation was observed furthermore it was calculated that the production cost of 1 l of water was 2 03 rs 0 013 us and verified with the monthly electricity bill 4 conclusions the electrochemical technique electrolysis was investigated for the removal of f mg2 ca2 co3 2 and hco3 elements those cause hardness and alkalinity from contaminated ground water by using non passivated platinum and stainless steel electrodes system performances to remove f mg2 ca2 co3 2 and hco3 ions versus c l co3 2 hco3 and mg2 were studied in the laboratory as well as in the field as a simple system it was found that the proposed systems had significant f hardness and alkalinity removal efficiencies and was capable of removing multiple elements f mg2 ca2 hco3 and co3 2 in groundwater to meet who and sri lankan drinking water quality standards furthermore a byproduct of cl2 g generation was found to be an added advantage that disinfects the final water initial carbonate and mg2 concentrations could affect the removal of f and elements causing hardness the chemical analysis and xrd data of precipitation confirmed the presence of caco3 and amorphous mg oh 2 particles which removed f mainly by adsorption and co precipitation respectively the formation of mgco3 was also conceivable but seems not significant at a higher c l acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge prof masamoto tafu dept appl chem

12217,a novel continuous flow electrolysis elc system comprised of non corrosive platinum anode and stainless steel cathode electrodes was proposed to remove fluoride f and elements that cause hardness magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 and alkalinity causing ions carbonates co3 2 and bicarbonates hco3 from naturally contaminated groundwater performances and ion removal mechanisms of the proposed system were studied with the effect of charge loading in electrolyte c l and initial ion concentrations in synthetic groundwater experimental results were used to design and build a community level treatment facility in the anuradhapura district sri lanka where high f elements causing hardness and alkalinity are found in the groundwater it was noticed that the proposed elc system water recovery 100 was capable of removing a significant amount of f by adsorption to the calcite caco3 phase and co precipitating with amorphous mg oh 2 the chemical composition of precipitation demonstrated that 6 9 mol of mg2 can remove 1 mol of f ions at higher charge loading 500 1500 c l for the initial levels of f 10 ca2 100 mg2 100 mg l and hco3 co3 2 9 42 mmol l it was found that a maximum of 57 of f 61 of mg2 94 of ca2 and 82 of hco3 co3 2 were effectively removed by the system moreover the proposed system exhibited the capability of disinfecting the final water as an extra advantage however system efficiencies of contaminant removal varied with the varying initial mg2 co3 2 hco3 co3 2 and charge loading the water quality data from the community level elc plant established shows that the proposed system was competent for the removal of f mg2 ca2 hco3 and co3 2 ions from groundwater to meet desirable standard levels as a simple robust and economical technology graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrolysis fluoride hardness charge loading 1 introduction groundwater is a major requisite drinking water source in the world and its contamination has been an issue due to the presence of various pollutants such as fluoride f elements causing hardness and heavy metals even though f is essential for humans for preventing dental and skeletal caries excess intake is detrimental to human health browne et al 2005 iano et al 2014 mandinic et al 2010 tiwari et al 2017 ayoob and gupta 2006 the acceptable safe limit of f recommended by the world health organization who is 1 5 mg l who 2017 hardness in water is caused by a variety of dissolved polyvalent metallic ions predominantly calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 cations the degree of hardness of drinking water is important for aesthetic acceptability such as palatability odor appearance and color hardness does not have a direct adverse effect on human health however it is troublesome for industries as well as households causing scaling on equipment pipelines storage tanks etc degrees of hardness are categorized as soft moderately hard hard and very hard according to the following range of equivalent caco3 concentrations converted from ca2 and mg2 concentrations in the water caco3 60 mg l soft 60 mg l caco3 120 mg l moderately hard 120 mg l caco3 180 mg l hard and 180 mg l caco3 extremely hard for removing f electrochemical methods have been proven as an effective way of treating polluted water de francesco and costamagna 2004 martínez huitle et al 2006 pulkka et al 2014 moreover mg2 and ca2 ions removal as calcite caco3 and brucite mg oh 2 minerals in the presence of hco3 ion by electrochemical methods in the vicinity of electrochemical generation of oh ion in the cathode was reported zeppenfeld 2011 common electrochemical methods are categorized as electrocoagulation eco electrochemical reduction electrochemical oxidation indirect electro oxidation with strong oxidants and photo assisted electrochemical methods brillas and martínez huitle 2015 among those methods eco has a long history as a water wastewater treatment technology that has been widely employed to remove a wide range of pollutants such as f organic dyes hardness and heavy metals nidheesh and singh 2017 sandoval et al 2014 zuo et al 2008 in eco the most commonly used technique for f and hardness removal sacrificial electrodes corrode to release active coagulant precursors usually aluminum or iron cations to form a metal hydroxide coagulant anode passivation and sludge deposition on the electrodes inhibiting the electrolysis process over time as well as the production of high amounts of iron and aluminum ions dissolved in the effluent are the main disadvantages of eco brillas et al 2003 but the lack of a systematic approach to the eco reactor design its operation and issues of electrode reliability particularly the passivation of the electrodes over time have further limited its implementation as a safe drinking water treatment holt et al 2005 recent technical improvements combined with a growing need for small scale decentralized water treatment facilities have led to a re invention of eco besides eco was identified as an emerging technique for the defluoridation of drinking water and industrial wastewater because of its versatility environmental compatibility and its significant process efficiency mollah et al 2001 by overcoming the disadvantages articulated developing an operational level eco treatment system to challenge other predominant treatment technologies such as reverse osmosis electrodialysis and adsorptive technologies is of greater interest to researchers however the challenge of developing such a system using only eco technology is problematic especially due to limited electrode materials electrolysis was found to be a well established electrochemical technology for cl2 g production but to date its use for drinking water treatment or f removal has not been reported but several studies presented that ca2 co3 2 and hco3 could effectively remove by electrolysis and electrochemical methods hasson et al 2010 zeppenfeld 1998 therefore in this work a novel continuous flow electrolysis elc system composed of non passivated platinum and stainless steel electrodes was used to remove f and elements causing hardness using natural water containing mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 ions the removal of f mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 was studied furthermore mechanisms of ion removal and process optimization were studied for different levels of operational and contaminate levels real groundwater treatment efficiencies system stability and laboratory prepared synthetic groundwater treatment efficiencies were compared to validate results by operating a community level elc water treatment facility in sri lanka 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals instruments and calculations all chemicals used in the experiments were analytical grade and

alpha radiation configuration 2theta min 30 kv 15 ma 450 w voltage logging was performed with onset hobo data logger due to the diprotic nature of carbonic acid h2co3 in the solution both co3 2 and hco3 ions are available and their concentrations would change with the solution ph therefore the sum of the carbonates hco3 and co3 2 concentrations hereafter hco3 co3 2 as mmol l was accounted for the alkalinity water samples hco3 co3 2 s charge was calculated by accounting system s ion charge balances the tracer ion concentrations were neglected and major ions were concerned in the calculation

storage and quality control a groundwater source located in the sri lanka the medawachchiya area 8 32 02 8 n 80 29 57 6 e the anuradhapura district was selected to perform the filed study water samples from the field and the laboratory were filtered to the 50 ml polyethylene bottles on location by using a membrane filter with a 0 45 μm pore size to eradicate bacteriological activities affecting the water quality and to remove the non dissolved particles the collected water samples from the field were transported to japan and analyzed within the 45 days of its collection laboratory samples were analyzed within one week of its collection appropriate dilutions and analysis were performed for the cation and anion with ion chromatograph by analyzing the calibration standard solution after each 20 samples the stability of the ion chromatographic detector was monitored for the quality control overall concentration variability of the examined calibration standard solution were obtained below the 5 or otherwise re analysis was performed 2 3 experimental setup of the elc cell an acrylic material tank having dimensions of 20 cm 10 5 cm 5 cm length height width was used as an elc reactor for the laboratory experiments the tank was separated into two cells with a 4 mm thick effective area 20 cm 10 5 cm permeable clay diaphragm the diaphragm helps to separate anode and cathode solutions prevents the mixing of sludge formed in the cathode and facilitates the exchange of ions between cells to lengthen the water flow in each cell individual cells were further divided into two equal slots with a acrylic plate keeping open 10 mm from the bottom effective volumes of the cathode and anode cells were 525 ml and 420 ml respectively u shaped platinum pt effective length 30 cm φ 0 40 mm and stainless steel ss effective length 30 cm φ 1 00 mm wires were used as electrodes for anodes and cathodes respectively the inter electrode distance was kept at 3 3 cm the assembly was connected to a constant current power supply for all experiments the elc cell configuration is shown in fig 1 2 4 unit treatment steps and operational description the experimental setup employed for the laboratory experiments is shown in fig 2 it describes an elc system comprised of a hco3 co3 2 removal configuration in which an aerator was utilized this system circulates anode bath water with a lower ph to remove hco3 co3 2 at both the anode and the aerator as carbon dioxide co2 eq 7 and is able to treat 100 of the water quantity for the experiments a series of f mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 spiked tap water as synthetic groundwater was continuously pumped to the elc reactor by applying a constant current to the immersed ss and pt electrodes as electrolysis progressed water molecules acquired electrons to form oh ions in the cathode cell causing high ph eq 8 while h ions generated in the anode cell caused a low ph environment eq 6 the majority of ions were removed at the cathode eqs 9 12 its higher ph environment starts precipitating co precipitating the mg2 f ca2 and hco3 co3 2 ions could involve in removing f eq 13 16 as a final treatment step a roughing sand filter was

mechanisms in the electrochemical process of removing f mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 key parameters that affect ion removal efficiencies include the current applied and retention time therefore electrolysis time or charge loading a ls 1 c l and current density a m2 are important parameters which affect the process performances however in this study elc without sacrificial electrodes was focused not on cost but on the treatment efficiency furthermore the amount of precipitates co precipitates and adsorbent produced in the process were proportional to the charge loading moreover charge loading is appropriate parameter for maintain performance when scaling to different treatment volumes hence the charge loading becomes the most important operational variables for describing elc treatment efficiency therefore in this section the effect of charge loading was described with the possible environmental contamination levels of f ca2 mg2 mg l and hco3 co3 2 mmol l in synthesized groundwater as reviewed by bhattacharya and samal 2018 and reported by kawakami et al 2014 the maximum f levels in groundwater in india japan nigeria brazil china and sri lanka were less than 10 mg l but in pakistan and indonesia maximum levels were exceeding the 14 mg l farooqui et al 2007 heikens et al 2005 accordingly this study was performed with the maximum f contamination level of 10 mg l the charge loading applied and respective current densities used a m2 current cross sectional area of the electrolyte between the anode and cathode were 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 c l and 2 38 4 76 7 14 9 52 11 9 14 29 a m2 respectively throughout the experiments system flow rates were kept constant 12 ml min in the cathode retention time 0 73 h and 8 ml min in the anode retention time 0 88 h variations of f cl na mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 removal percentages in cathode and anode baths for increasing charge loading are shown in fig 3 a b respectively note that the hco3 co3 2 removed in the system includes the hco3 co3 2 removed at the anode h ions reacting with hco3 co3 2 to form co2 g hco3 co3 2 removed at the aerator as co2 g by reacting with residual h ions from the anode and hco3 co3 2 precipitated as caco3 and mgco3 moreover the dilution of raw water hco3 co3 2 took place at the aerator by mixing with none or less hco3 co3 2 solution circulating through the anode according to fig 3a the removal of f and mg2 showed a steady but significant rise over that of the applied charge loading c l removal of ca2 showed a slight rise over that of the c l totaling more than 86 for the increasing c l hco3 co3 2 removals increased gradually at 250 c l the removal percentages of f and mg2 ions in the cathode bath were 20 and 16 respectively steadily reaching maximums of 57 and 61 at 1500 c l at 250 c l 55 of co3 2 hco3 had been removed gradually increasing to a maximum of 82 at 1500 c l the removal of both f and mg2 increased similarly with an increase of c l therefore there is an effect of f removed by the mg2 forming agents mg oh 2 mgco3 and mgf2 due to the alkaline nature in cathode obviously mg2 forms mg oh 2 and mgco3 precipitates an average of 92 of ca2 was removed showing a minimum of 87 and a maximum of 95 at 250 c l and 1500 c l respectively according to the hco3 and co3 2 equilibrium eq 5 a significant amount of co3 2 can be formed at a higher ph therefore the removal of more than 92 of ca2 was promised by forming caco3 precipitation in a high ph environment since both ca2 hco3 and co3 2 precursors were readily available table 1 summarizes the molar concentration of ion removal for co3 2 hco3 s carbon mg2 and ca2 for different c ls particularly h and oh were involved in removing the co3 2 hco3 s carbon as co2 and forms of precipitates caco3 and mgco3 respectively the h and oh introduced were calculated by assuming all electrons were contributed to form h and oh ions h oh coulomb ampere second faraday constant table 1 column 2 assuming that carbon removal only ensued by forming caco3 and co2 carbon removed as co2 was calculated table 1 column 6 from the difference between h and co2 it was found that the amounts of h remaining after forming co2 was higher than the calculated carbon removed as co2 except in 250 c l column 7 usually for the resulted carbon removal as co2 not equal but higher level of h concentrations are required since in reality all electrons were not involved in generating the h therefore at 250 c l the only plausible mechanism for the removal of 0 54 mmol l of carbon should be the formation of mgco3 precipitate furthermore the summation of mg2 removed and h introduced for 250 c l was higher than the co3 2 hco3 s carbon removed as other forms 2 59 0 71 3 30 mmol l hence it can be concluded that lower c l co3 2 hco3 s carbon removal occurred via the formation of mgco3 according to fig 3a and table 1 it is clear that the removal of mg2 as well as co3 2 hco3 carbon increased as the charge loading increased the increase of charge loading directly resulted in producing more h to remove co3 2 hco3 s carbon as co2 and supplementary oh ion to form mg oh 2 this also caused increased removal of both mg2 and co3 2 hco3 s carbon similarly increases of charge loading upsurge the formation of oh thus co3 2 ion according to the le chatlier s principle eq 9 which leads to higher growth of caco3 and mgco3 ions ksp value of the formation increase as mgco3 caco3 mg oh 2 therefore the concentrations of precipitation should be increase as mgco3 caco3 mg oh 2 if ion interferences were not occurred the ion removals in cathode mainly depends on the amount of mg2 and ca2 precipitated therefore by using the amount of mg2 and ca2 precipitated and applied coulomb the ion current efficiency η was calculated as shown in eq 17 assuming oh were not reacted with h in the cathode all the h were consumed by co3 2 hco3 to form co2 at the aerator and anode or no h oh ion transferred through diaphragm η precipitated magnesium mol l precipitated calcium mol l 100 generded hydroxyl mol l 17 η m g i n i t i a l m g e q u l i b r i u m 2 c a i n i t i a l c a e q u l i b r i u m 2 a p p l i e d c o u l o m b f a r a d a y c o n s t a n t 100 according to eq 17 calculated ion removal efficiencies for the 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 c l were 109 56 43 37 35 31 respectively the trend of lower removal efficiencies could be due to the decrease of precipitate precipitation reaching its equilibrium decrease of co3 2 hco3 species and electron unexploited such as oh consumed by hco3 to form co3 2 in alkaline condition and cl2 g production eq 18 in the anode according to fig 3b in an anode bath the removal of ca2 mg2 f and na was mostly stabilized over the varying c l while cl ion removal showed a significant negative decrease over the increasing c l the positive removal of f mg2 ca2 and na in the anode bath resulted from ion transportation to the cathode bath by a coulomb force and ion concentration gradient when the electrolysis continued ca2 mg2 and f ions were precipitated in the cathode bath creating an environment of lower ion concentration and creating an ion concentration gradient between the anode and cathode to balance the deficiency of the ions in the cathode solution both the ion concentration gradient and the encouraging coulomb force transport mg2 ca2 and na ions through the clay diaphragm by overcoming the encouraging coulomb force the ion concentration gradient alone transported f ion to the cathode bath which could be precipitated as caf2 mgf2 co precipitated with mg oh 2 or adsorbed by caco3 mgco3 mixture the stabilized ph variations over current densities after 24 h operation are presented in fig 3c a slight increase of ph in the cathode and a slight decrease of ph in both aerators can be observed for increasing charge loading as a result of an upsurge of oh and h ions respectively according to fig 3a b cl ion movement from the cathode to the anode by the coulomb force and an ion concentration gradient can be seen as negative and positive removal percentages respectively even though cl was not precipitated the removal of cl ions in the cathode bath increased slightly with increasing c l although it was not proportional to the amount transported from the anode this was rather strange as the disappearing cl ion should appear in the cathode bath in an increasing manner over the increasing c l the process of continuous water circulation and lower cl2 g evaporation cause that trend of incremental cl concentration in the cathode bath the formation of cl2 g byproducts in the anode eq 18 was an extra advantage of this system since water dissolved cl2 g produced hocl ion attributes for water disinfection lower ph level in the anode is favorable of dissociating cl2 g and hydrolysis into hocl at aerator is almost complete at aerator operational ph 5 furthermore by measuring the total chlorine data were not shown hear with dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 the presence of hocl was confirmed however the excessive level of chlorine may negatively affect the final water palatability if the water used for drinking purpose it was found that an increase in total chlorine over increasing c l it increased up to 35 mg l at 1500 c l which was far beyond the desirable level of chlorine at 0 2 mg l this level may be reduced based on the initial cl level and current applied to the water however prior to the consumption of treated water the excessive chlorine concentration should be reduced if it exceeds the limit water storage for a particular time with aeration and activated carbon filtration could be a reliable solution 18 2 c l a q c l 2 g 2 e table 2 summarizes the chemical composition of precipitates from different charge loading operations according to table 2 data approximately 6 9 mol of mg removed 1 mol of f at a higher charge loading 500 1500 c l however for a lower 250 c l 2 mol of mg removed 1 mol of f the ratio of molar to mass mol g of ca ion in the precipitate reduced but ratio of molar to mass mol g of mg ion increased with increasing c ls possibly forming the mg oh 2 carbon mol g in the precipitate decreases as ca decreases over increasing c l obviously presence of mg oh 2 in the precipitate cause this effect according to table 2 column 9 it seems that o h mg g was not enough for the balancing carbon precipitated 135 mg g as co3 2 at 250 c l total of 540 mg l oxygen required for balancing the 135 mg g carbon in precipitate during the precipitate drying process a minor amount of mg oh 2 caco3 and mgco3 can be converted to mgo and cao thus co2 and h2o can be released could cause such a deviation the xrd analysis of precipitates fig 4 show diffraction peaks of aragonite caco3 dominant phase and calcite ca mg co3 in agreement with earlier studies the presence of mg2 leads to the aragonite precipitation rather than thermodynamically favored calcite phase reddy and karin wang 1980 karoui et al 2013 however the presence of crystalline brucite mg oh 2 fluorite caf2 or sellaite mgf2 were not observed in the xrd spectrum nevertheless some broad diffraction peaks appeared in the xrd spectrum at higher current densities of 1000 1500 c l these peaks may be due to an amorphous or partially crystalline nature of mg oh 2 saoud et al 2014 reported in the previous study data that broad diffraction peaks 2θ degrees represented nano particles of mg oh 2 prepared by microwave assisted precipitation process fluoride precipitation with ca2 ion as caf2 s was a well known technology but xrd results revealed the absence of caf2 or mgf2 however removal of f by adsorption to the calcite was reported in several studies jain and jayaram 2009 turner et al 2005 therefore according to the chemical composition of the precipitate and xrd observations it can be concluded that f was removed by adsorption to the calcite phase at lower current densities for larger current densities both mg oh 2 particles and calcite involved in f removal the previous studies of de fluoridation of water using nano magnesium oxide suggested that f metathesis between mg oh 2 and f could occur due to the iso electric nature and similar size of f and oh ions devi et al 2012 oladoja et al 2016 furthermore co precipitation mechanism for f removal by mg oh 2 was proposed by nidheesh and singh 2017 as they described a sweep flocculation coagulation mechanism occurs in the presence of hydrolyzable metal cations here mg2 according to the xrd results all of the species formed could not be identified due to the amorphous nature of the precipitates and the low quantity of some species formed therefore by visual minteq freeware package ion speciation was modeled as shown in fig 5 for the initial levels of f mg2 ca2 and hco3 co3 2 as 10 100 100 mg l and 10 mmol l respectively according to the speciation most dominate species formed in the elc operational ph range 9 12 were caco3 mgco3 and mg oh 2 in agreement with the xrd results furthermore visual minteq saturation index data revealed that in ph 8 aragonite caco3 calcite caco3 dolomite ca mg co3 2 fluorite caf2 huntite mg3 ca co3 4 magnesite mgco3 and in ph 12 aragonite artinite mg2 co3 oh 2 3h2o brucite mg oh 2 calcite dolomite fluorite huntite hydromagnesite mg5 co3 4 oh 2 4h2o and magnesite mineral phases were saturated even though saturation index data showed the fluorite saturation in high ph levels the formation of caf was found negligible while the formation of mgf decreased with increasing ph level according to fig 5 furthermore the modeled speciation diagram did not show significant f removal as found in the elc experimental results thus simulated speciation results were unable to describe the f removal and complexation mechanism profoundly 3 2 effect of initial co3 2 hco3 on ion removal efficiencies as identified previously co3 2 hco3 inhibit the formation of mg oh 2 and f removal but they increase ca2 removal in order to have a comprehensive idea about how co3 2 hco3 influence the system s performance elc experiments were performed at 750 c l for the initial f 10 mg l ca2 100 mg l mg2 100 mg l and various co3 2 hco3 ranging 2 10 mmol l system flow rates were maintained at 12 ml min in the cathode contact time 0 73 h and 8 ml min in the anode contact time 0 875 h results obtained are summarized in fig 6 fig 6a b illustrates the removal of f cl na mg2 ca2 and co3 2 hco3 in the cathode bath and the respective ph variations in unit treatment steps according to fig 6a in the cathode bath the removal of the f and mg2 steadily decreased as the co3 2 hco3 increased while cl and na ion removal showed a slight incremental increase over the increasing hco3 for the 2 1 4 7 mmol l of the initial hco3 concentrations more than 96 of co3 2 hco3 were removed most of the co3 2 hco3 tended to be removed at the anode and the aerator by reacting with h eq 7 if we assumed that all h ions produced at 750 c l table 1 column 2 were reacted with co3 2 hco3 at the anode and the aerator a total of 7 77 mmol l of co3 2 hco3 should be removed as co2 g however as fig 6 data showed only 62 5 83 mmol l of co3 2 hco3 were removed for 9 41 mmol l of initial hco3 level even though removal of 77 7 7 31 mmol l was expected within the proposed elc system many minor reactions can occur therefore electrons unexploited for other reactions could be the reason for such decreases for the initial co3 2 hco3 levels of 2 1 9 4 mmol l the removal of 2 07 6 26 mmol l of co3 2 hco3 can be detected this level was lower than the h introduced 7 77 mmol l thus ensuring a high co3 2 hco3 removal as co2 moreover co3 2 hco3 were not removed only by h ions however lower h higher oh ca2 and mg2 led to the formation of caco3 and mgco3 in the cathode bath eqs 9 11 the removal of ca2 showed a significant incremental increase over the increasing co3 2 hco3 at the 2 1 mmol l co3 2 hco3 level ca2 removal was negative the absence of the co3 2 hco3 and coulomb transportation of ca2 ions to the cathode creates this phenomenon therefore maintaining an adequate amount of co3 2 hco3 was favorable for removing a significant amount of ca2 ions however it decreases the mg2 and f removal by consuming oh it is obviously lower co3 2 hco3 which increases mg2 and f removal in the absence or low concentrations of co3 2 hco3 in the cathode the formation of mg oh 2 was more favorable hence f co precipitation was enriched as shown in fig 6b ph variation in the cathode bath showed a slight decrease while the anode ph showed a slight increase conversely the aerator ph rapidly increases with increasing hco3 due to h ions insufficient for removing increasing co3 2 hco3 therefore for higher levels of initial co3 2 hco3 a higher level of operational charge loading is required to maximize both f and mg2 removal 3 3 effect of initial mg2 concentration on ion removal efficiencies in this section the influence of initial mg2 concentration on ion removal was described at 750 c l the initial levels of f 10 mg l ca2 100 mg l and co3 2 hco3 9 42 mmol l but with varying mg2 levels 0 100 mg l in synthetic groundwater were used for the experiments the flow rates of the system were maintained at 12 ml min in the cathode contact time 0 73 h and at 8 ml min in the anode contact time 0 875 h results obtained are summarized as line graphs as shown in fig 7 according to fig 7 more than 90 removal of ca2 can be observed for all levels of mg2 carbonate removal showed a slight increase from 57 to 60 for 0 100 mg l mg2 noticeably f removal showed a slight increase of 0 100 mg l for the initial mg2 range the removal of mg2 was found to increase 0 25 mg l for 0 100 mg l at initial mg2 levels therefore the amount of mg oh 2 formed was increased with respect to the initial mg2 concentration which leads to increased f co precipitation a slight increase of co3 2 hco3 but decrees in ca2 removal can be observed with increasing mg2 it is known that mg2 ions act to inhibit the crystal growth of caco3 the inhibition of caco3 growth by the presence of mg2 is caused by mg2 being incorporated in the original caco3 seed surface and developing a new crystal surface but not the mgco3 lin and singer 2009 zhang and dawe 2000 therefore in our system mg2 was not actively participating in the removal of co3 2 hco3 as mgco3 however the degree of ca2 removal with increasing mg2 indicates that a mg2 inhibit the formation of caco3 the calculated molar concentrations of h at 750 c l 7 77 mmol l the average carbonate removal 5 38 mmol l and the average ca2 removal 2 37 mmol l verify that most of the carbon from co3 2 hco3 removed by reacting with h were produced by an electrolysis reaction the rest of the carbon from co3 2 hco3 were removed as caco3 and mgco3 in higher and smaller proportions respectively the removal of na and cl showed degrees of increasing mg2 levels since we are using mgcl2 for synthetic water with increasing mg2 cl ion concentration increases therefore cl removal decreases 3 4 development and operation of a community level water treatment plant to remove f and elements causing hardness for the design and implementation for an operational scale water treatment plant a part of sri lanka was selected where naturally contaminated groundwater had become a threat to humans groundwater in the northern part of sri lanka was found to be rich in natural contaminants such as f mg2 ca2 and alkalinity at higher levels additionally people in the northern part of the country had chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology ckdu as well as dental and skeletal fluorosis due to high levels of f and other elements such as mg2 and ca2 chandrajith et al 2011 kawakami et al 2014 perera et al 2008 weragoda et al 2013 table 3 summarizes groundwater quality data from some of the selected districts in sri lanka kawakami et al 2014 the data shows that higher f concentrations are present along with significant amounts of mg2 ca2 and alkalinity accordingly a groundwater source located in the anuradhapura district the medawachchiya area location 8 32 02 8 n 80 29 57 6 e was selected for the installation of a community level treatment system with a production capacity of 374 l day resident time 0 77 h for both anode and cathode for the design a new laboratory system was adopted by combining an aeration unit inside the anode bath combining the anode with the aeration unit reduced the system complexity and the number of pumps to one while minimizing the power consumption and cost of building fig 8 as a power source a constant voltage power supply max 10 a was used by measuring the voltage across the resistor using data logger onset hobo the amperage was calculated two reactors made of a perspex acrylic material similar to the laboratory experimental elc reactor were utilized at the treatment plant the effective total volume of the anode and cathode was 12 l 28 cm 40 cm 5 357cm 2 pt wires 30 cm 2 and ss mesh 2 cm 2 cm were used as anode and cathode electrodes respectively the water quality of w w was shown in table 4 according to table 4 there was a high concentration of f in the well water exceeding the sri lankan maximum regularity limit of 1 mg l as well as the who limit of 1 5 mg l slsi 2013 who 2017 other ions concentrations also found at extremely high and did not fluctuate significantly during the operating period fig 9 shows the charge loading calculated at the sampling time for 59 days of continuous operation it was found that the charge loading and current densities were fluctuated 1143 1408 c l and 25 63 27 23 a m2 respectively the changes in well water ww quality are attributed to this fluctuation the water quality measured for raw water and water treated for a 59 day continuous operation is shown in fig 10 after being treated with the system the f concentration was reduced dramatically and became mostly stable during the operational period the f concentrations in treated water were found to be under both sri lankan and who regularity limits fig 10b shows the mg2 concentration of well water and treated water for 59 days of continuous operation there was a high concentration of mg2 in the well water exceeding the sri lankan maximum regularity limit of 30 mg l and it did not show significant fluctuations during the operating period except for three treated water samples samples showed a mg2 level lower than the sri lankan maximum regularity limit but all are lower than 40 mg l fig 9c shows the removal of ca2 ion and it demonstrates that ca2 ion was effectively removed by the system according to fig 9d extremely high hco3 levels were observed in the well water and the partial removal of co3 2 hco3 at the anode was observed as expected the partial removal of co3 2 hco3 leads to the removal of high quantities of ca2 the level of co3 2 hco3 as hco3 in the treated water was observed to be below 5172 μeq l to meet the desirable level of hco3 a much higher level of current should be applied however applying such a high current was not economically viable at the time but except co3 2 hco3 other ions were removed effectively by the system however the increase of charge loading further for the proposed system can meet that water quality target for f and hardness causing ions fig 10e shows the ph profile of ww and treated water fig 11 compares the averaged water quality data of the community level system with the laboratory experimental data it shows that the averaged ion removal efficiencies of f and mg2 were higher than the experimental values an initial f average 2 42 mg l concentration lower than the experimental level 10 mg l could be the reason for this higher removal the initial mg2 concentration in the community level treatment plant was slightly higher than that in the laboratory system 107 mg l however it demonstrated much more efficient removal ww average ca2 removal was found to be lower than the experimental value initial ww ca2 56 68 mg l and ca2 100 mg l but its removal was comparably much similar to the experimental removal as described previously mg2 ions act to inhibit the crystal growth of caco3 lin and singer 2009 zhang and dawe 2000 can attribute for such a decrease however results of the laboratory experimental study proposed cannot be used to predict the actual ion removal with the treatment system due to different initial ion concentrations fluctuating charge loading as well as reactor dissimilarities retention time aeration in anode etc therefore a significantly more complex mathematical model is required to predict the removal of f and other ions for initial ion concentrations c l retention time etc based on the water quality results of the community level plant and its distinct capabilities to remove f mg2 ca2 and hco3 ions smooth operation was observed furthermore it was calculated that the production cost of 1 l of water was 2 03 rs 0 013 us and verified with the monthly electricity bill 4 conclusions the electrochemical technique electrolysis was investigated for the removal of f mg2 ca2 co3 2 and hco3 elements those cause hardness and alkalinity from contaminated ground water by using non passivated platinum and stainless steel electrodes system performances to remove f mg2 ca2 co3 2 and hco3 ions versus c l co3 2 hco3 and mg2 were studied in the laboratory as well as in the field as a simple system it was found that the proposed systems had significant f hardness and alkalinity removal efficiencies and was capable of removing multiple elements f mg2 ca2 hco3 and co3 2 in groundwater to meet who and sri lankan drinking water quality standards furthermore a byproduct of cl2 g generation was found to be an added advantage that disinfects the final water initial carbonate and mg2 concentrations could affect the removal of f and elements causing hardness the chemical analysis and xrd data of precipitation confirmed the presence of caco3 and amorphous mg oh 2 particles which removed f mainly by adsorption and co precipitation respectively the formation of mgco3 was also conceivable but seems not significant at a higher c l acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge prof masamoto tafu dept appl chem

12218,the suitability of water for any use depends on its level of quality which can be influenced by several factors this research determined the quality of shallow hand dug wells for domestic and irrigation uses in the rural localities of ilorin northcentral nigeria twenty 20 water samples were collected from shallow hand dug wells in the study area during wet and dry seasons the water samples were assessed for physical and chemical qualities results indicates that ph of water samples is acidic to alkaline which ranges between 6 7 and 7 6 in dry season and ranges from 6 6 to 7 2 for wet season the ph values fall within the permissible limits of world health organization who standards and nigerian drinking water quality standards ndwqs quality standards of chemical parameters analysed in the water samples falls within the permissible limits mghco3 is considered as the most dominant water type in both seasons magnesium occurrence was traced to the disintegration of rock minerals while dominance of bicarbonates in the water contributed mostly by carbon dioxide charged recharge water during precipitation irrigation parameters tested includes soluble sodium percentage ssp residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc sodium absorption ratio sar and magnesium adsorption ratio mar which all indicates that the water samples are also suitable for irrigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality shallow hand dug wells water table aquifer rock mineral rural localities 1 introduction quality assessment of groundwater is of great concern for mankind because it has a direct influence on human life the quality of groundwater resource is of great important whether for industrial domestic or for agricultural uses presently reliability on groundwater for drinking is used by more than fifty percent of the world s population including those who live in the rural areas of developing world tatawat and chandel 2008 one of the largest uses of groundwater is also in the area of crop irrigations in the rural farming system where some water resource sources such as dam canal or river are not available therefore the quality of groundwater is very important in such area see tables 9 12 current analysis has proved that groundwater getspolluted drastically by various factors which include anthropogenic sources such as improper disposes of sewage waste garbage which have caused a lot of water borne diseases cholera typhoid diarrhoea viral haemorrhagic fever agricultural wastes from the use of pesticides insecticides and fertilizers which often dispersed over large area could infiltrates and causes threat to the fresh groundwater ecosystem rao and prasanthi 2012 pollution of groundwater can also occur through natural sources such as soil that possess some high level of heavy metals which could leached into the groundwater and also has been established that geology play an important role in the chemistry of groundwater as the hosting lithologies contribute most of the cations and anions observed in the groundwater abimbola et al 2002 groundwater pollution also results from industrial effluent discharges remediation of groundwater contamination is thus very difficult except in some defined small area but most emphasis on the groundwater contamination remediation is placed on prevention before contamination occurs the study intends to highlig highlight quality status in the shallow aquifer hand dug wells of the study area with their hydrochemical dynamics as well as those factors influence its quality in this study shallow aquifer hand dug wells were assessed for their concentrations of inorganic substances shallow hand dug wells are targeted in this research because it is the main source of water supply in this study area and also it is generally believed that shallow permeable water table aquifers are the most susceptible to contamination 2 study area the study area is a rural community situated in ilorin area of kwara state in the northcentral part of nigeria it is bounded by latitude 8 32 and 8 36 and longitude 4 39 and 4 43 which falls within the basement complex of nigeria fig 1 people in the study area rely on a shallow hand dug wells as their primary source of water for domestic and irrigations uses the geology of the area is underlain by crystalline rocks of basement complex different types of crystalline rocks are found in various parts of the study area among which are migmatite gneiss banded gneiss granite gneiss augen gneiss quartzites older granites and also observed are the intrusions of pegmatitic rocks the crystalline rocks possess porosities of less than 3 bouwer 1978 rocks of basement complex when not weathered are not permeable and produce no storage capacity 3 materials and methods twenty 20 groundwater samples were randomly collected from shallow hand dug wells in the study area fig 2 these water samples were taken from different places in the study area purposely to have a wide coverage of the sampling sampling exercise was carried out for both wet and dry seasons the first water sampling was carried out in the middle of march representing the peak of dry season while the second water sampling was conducted in late september that represent maximum period of rain season because sampling involving two seasons will allow groundwater elemental concentration monitoring it is observed that the quality status of water sampled for a particular season of a given well may or may not actually represent the same quality status when later sampled for the same well in another season period 4 results and discussions 4 1 domestic use water samples collected from the wells were analysed for their major cation and anion concentrations the physical analysis of the water samples was taken directly on the field while chemical analysis was conducted in the chemistry department university of ilorin ilorin nigeria anions were analysed by means of convectional titration methods while cations were determined using standard methods of atomic absorption spectrophotometry a statistical summary for the physico chemical analyses of the sampled wells in the study area is presented in table 1 the interpretation of physical and chemical parameters for domestic use was based on world health organization standards who 2011 for potable water according to satpathy et al 1987 westbrook et al 2005 frohlich et al 2008 kim et al 2009 and vengosh 2013 described different processes and factors that could aid hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater to include anthropogenic contamination ion exchange dissolution and dilution water rock interaction and interaction of seawater especially through the precipitation and salinisation the ph values for the analysed water samples found between 6 7 and 7 6 for the dry season having a mean of 7 1 while ranges from 6 6 to 7 2 in wet season with a mean of 6 9 the ph for the both seasons is within the acceptable permissible limits by w h o 2011 standard of 6 5 8 5 therefore the ph in the study area is acidic to alkaline in nature electrical conductivity of the water samples tested in the area ranges between 106 and 318 μs cm and a mean of 209 2 μs cm for dry season while for the wet season ranges between 119 and 379 μs cm and a mean of 226 6 μs cm the ec for the two seasons falls within the world health organization w h o 2011 permissible standards for drinking water which is 1000 μs cm however some traces of high amount of ec in sampled water could be attributed to the presence of some metallic ore in the basement rocks within the area total dissolve solids tds in the water samples for dry season found between 96 and 176 mg l with a mean of 126 6 and 107 176 mg l of a mean 132 2 mg l for the wet season for the two seasons tds is within the acceptable limits of 1000 mg l w h o 2011 therefore with tds water in the area is suitable for drinking one of the strong effects of having high percentage value of tds in water is gastro intestinal irritation and can also causes stains of fabric olusiji and adeyinka 2010 total hardness in the sampled water for the dry season ranges between 7 2 and 18 6 mg l with a mean of 11 6 mg l and 8 4 22 4 of a mean 13 1 for the wet season based on the standard permissible limit of w h o 2011 which is 500 mg l the water for both seasons is soft and considered to be fit for human consumption most of the occurrence of hardness in water associated with the presence of high amount in magnesium and calcium ions mg and ca2 turbidity of 5 0 ntu usually recommended for portable water but for the sampled water in dry season ranges between 2 0 and 3 0 with a mean of 2 3 while between 2 0 and 3 2 of a mean of 2 5 for wet season and this shows that turbidity for those considered seasons are falls within the maximum acceptable standards of who calcium values in the analysed water is between 1 0 and 5 4 mg l with a mean of 2 9 mg l for the dry season while ranges between 2 2 and 10 8 mg l of a mean 5 6 mg l based on the w h o 2011 standard for calcium in drinking water there is no specific limitations but on the side of nigerian standards drinking water quality nsdwq 2007 the allowable permissible limit for calcium should not exceed 75 mg l water samples in the area for the both seasons falls within the acceptable level of nsdwq calcium ca and magnesium mg are found in large quantities in some brine in some cases high amount of calcium within the earth crust could responsible for its presence in the groundwater also almost all natural waters including seawater contain either or both calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate calcium occurs in many other silicate minerals that are present in the rocks such as garnet epidote titanite and wollastonite magnesium contents in the samples for the dry season is between 1 6 and 6 3 mg l with a mean of 3 2 mg l while ranges between 2 2 and 9 4 mg l with a mean of 4 7 mg l when compared with a standard given by who of 20 mg l magnesium in the analysed water for the two seasons found to be suitable for any domestic purpose high presence of magnesium in water results from leaching of ferromagnesian minerals like biotite olivine that present in the rocks magnesium also forms in groundwater when there is a contact between some certain rocks and groundwater especially carbonate minerals as they do occur in natural water sodium values in the water for the dry season ranges from 2 4 to 8 4 mg l with a mean of 4 5 mg l and for the wet season ranges between 4 4 and 6 5 mg l having a mean of 3 9 mg l the w h o 2011 recommended limits for sodium is 200 mg l therefore all the water samples in both the seasons are found with the acceptable standard limits making the water in the area to be suitable and fit for human consumption potassium permissible limit in the drinking water was not specified by w h o 2011 but consideration was based on the nigerian drinking water quality standards ndwqs 2007 limit of 10 mg l for the dry season the potassium concentration in the water ranges from 5 9 to 10 8 mg l with a mean of 8 3 mg l and for the wet season found between 5 6 and 10 6 mg l of a mean 8 1 mg l it was observed that in some locations like 13 14 16 and 20 in the two seasons there was high level in potassium concentrations and these were attributed to the abundance of potassium in some mineral vein intrusions that are present in the most basement rocks in the area like pegmatite intrusions in migmatite outcrops of the area concentrations of chloride in the sampled water for the dry season are between 6 6 and 13 8 mg l with a mean of 10 2 mg l while for the wet season ranges from 4 2 to 9 8 mg l with a mean of 6 0 mg l however who maximum permissible limits for the chloride is 250 mg l water samples in the two considered seasons are found with the standard acceptable limits some of the sources of chloride presence in water include human wastes fertilizers and dissolution of magmatic rocks freeze and cherry 1979 also some other source of chloride in the water involves recharge from meteoric water weathering from underlying basement rocks olusiji and adeyinka 2010 bicarbonates values ranges from 12 5 to 84 9 mg l with a mean of 34 9 mg l for the dry season and ranges from 16 8 to 108 2 mg l with a mean of 44 0 mg l there is no specific limit provided by the w h o 2011 for bicarbonates in water but it was observed that most of the bicarbonate ion occurrence in the water results from the dissolution of carbonate rocks carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from respiration of aquatic organisms sulphate concentration values in the dry season of analysed water samples is between 12 4 and 28 3 mg l with a mean of 21 8 mg l and for the wet season ranges from 7 6 to 22 6 mg l having a mean of 19 0 mg l the standard limit by the w h o 2011 for sulphate in water is 250 mg l those values for the water sample within the seasons considered falls in the standard limits some trace of sulphate in the water sampled in the area might have resulted from some improper disposing of solid and liquid wastes in the area and also by unlawful use of chemical like fertilizers by the farmers in the area though sulphates also occur in natural water nitrate concentration ranges between 1 5 and 4 1 mg l with a mean of 2 8 mg l for dry season while ranges from 0 4 to 2 9 mg l of a mean 2 0 mg l for the wet season who acceptable standard for nitrate in water is 50 mg l therefore all the water samples in the area for the two concerned seasons are within the acceptable limit minor traces of nitrates in water of the study area implies that there is just little impact from agricultural practices in the area and small effects of sewage dispose in the area nitrates could also occur in the soil naturally through degradation of microbes in nitrogenous organic material like protein iron levels in the dry season of sampled water is found between 0 1 and 0 8 mg l with a mean of 0 4 mg l while for the wet season is from 0 1 0 0 3 mg l with a mean of 0 08 mg l standard recommended level by the w h o 2011 for iron is 3 0 mg l therefore water samples in the area for both seasons are within the acceptable limits which signifies that the water in the area is good for human health some traces of few occurrence of iron in water of the area probably due to the weathering of iron mineral rocks like garnets magnetite amphibolite that are present in the area main water types in the area were determined based on the percentage of each cation and anion present in the water in milliequivalent per litre as shown in table 2 and table 3 which later presented on the piper diagram piper 1944 as shwon in fig 3 mghco3 is considered as the most dominant water type in the area for both two seasons the most possibly factor that responsible for the geochemical processes in the water type in this area is the dissolution of minerals in the various rock types that are found in the area further evidence in supporting water rock interaction as the main factor for the geochemical processes of groundwater chemistry in the area is shown in the plotted gibbs 1970 diagram in fig 4 occurrence of magnesium mg2 also results from the breakdown of some mineralogical components that are present in the rocks which includes minerals like biotite hornblende pyroxene and olivine dominance of bicarbonates in the water contributed mostly by the carbon dioxide charged recharge water during precipitation mg2 ca2 and hc03 play roles in the chemistry of groundwater through the dissolution of carbonate rocks while silicate weathering regarded as the process behind some amount of na and k that present in the water other prominent water type in the area is mgs04 and presence of sulphates in this water attributed to the use of some harmful farm chemicals like fertilizers pesticides by the farmers in the area though sulphates also occur in natural water 4 2 saturation indices the major elements and trace metals are transported in the chemical elements through groundwater both anion and cation concentrations that are present in groundwater form complex association therefore aqueous complexes formations are very necessary in describing aquifer characteristics because both toxicity and bioavailability of metals that are usually occur in water are based on the aqueous speciation or complexation of the metal langmuir 1997 saturation indices si is useful to determine possible chemical reaction and to measure some level of chemical departures from the thermodynamic equilibrium between the aquifer and minerals present saturation index si of water samples was calculated using below equation 1 si log10 iap ksp where iap refers to as the ion activity product and ksp is the solubility product at a given temperature however the saturation index si in a particular mineral indicates whether the groundwater is undersaturated with respect to the mineral in question when the value of si is below 0 it is at the equilibrium with the mineral when calculated value of si is 0 or regarded to be supersaturated aqueous solution with respect to the mineral in question when it is greater than 0 consecutively if the groundwater is considered to be undersaturated with respect to the mineral as been showed with a negative si this means that the groundwater would theoretically dissolve that particular mineral concerned but if the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to a particular mineral this implies that the mineral would precipitate from the groundwater though there are still some uncertainties which are associated with the range values of si that indicates equilibrium phases due to some anomalies from the field measured of ph values laboratory analysed concentration of ions ionic strength and equilibrium constants that are involved during calculations of si parameters langmuir 1997 in this research a geochemical program called phreeqc developed by parkhurst and appelo 1999 was applied in calculating si values for twenty 20 hand dug well samples collected from the study area in both wet and dry seasons table 4 and table 5 results from si calculated values shows water in the study area for two considered seasons wet and dry seasons are greatly undersaturated with respect to anhydrite cas04 gypsum caso4 2h2o and halite nacl which means that these minerals will continue to dissolve in the water the water is supersaturated with respect to the calcite aragonite and dolomite the over saturation of these minerals most especially dolomite results from presence of calcium and magnesium in the water calcium ca and magnesium mg are found in large quantities in some brine in some cases high amount of calcium within the earth crust could responsible for its presence in the groundwater also almost all natural waters including seawater contain either or both calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate calcium also forms in many silicate minerals that present in the rocks like garnet epidote titanite and wollastonite magnesium occurrence in the water is possibly results from the dissolution of mineral rocks ferromagnesian minerals such as biotite and olivine in the area as it been observed from a high concentration of magnesium in the water samples and magnesium rich groundwater containing a significant amount of salt is also thought to be essential for dolomite formation 4 3 irrigation use the parameters used in the characterization of shallow wells for irrigation in this work are soluble sodium percentage ssp residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc which were calculated based on approach given by todd 1980 and gupta 1987 sodium absorption ratio sar was calculated using richards 1954 magnesium adsorption ratio mar calculated based on raghunath 1987 as well as total dissolved solids tds richards 1954 as shown in table 6 and table 7 based on the following equations 2 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 3 s s p n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 4 rsbc hc03 2 ca2 5 m a r m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 joshi et al 2009 explained that high concentration of electrical conductance ec causes reduction in the amount of water going to the plants ec provide status of salinity hazard in water and its effects on the productivity of crops the ec values obtained in this work ranges between 106 and 318 μs cm with a mean of 209 2 μs cm for the dry season while for the wet season ranges between 119 and 379 μs cm with a mean of 226 6 μs c and all these values are within the acceptable limits of 1000 μs cm w h o 2011 based on the description by richard 1954 who described that water can only be used for irrigation only when its possess low to moderate saline water fig 5 total dissolved solids tds obtained from the water samples for dry season is between 96 and 176 mg l with a mean of 126 6 and 107 176 mg l of a mean 132 2 mg l for the wet season for the two seasons tds is within the acceptable limits of 1000 mg l therefore with tds water in the area is suitable for irrigation also based on the classification of robinove et al 1958 this water is regarded as non saline and considered to be excellent for irrigation see fig 6 sodium absorption ratio sar value for each of analysed water samples was determined based on the richard 1954 as described above however sodium hazard is generally expressed as the sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar shows specific amount of sodium calcium and magnesium ions that are present in the water for this work the sar ranges from 1 2 to 3 5 for the dry season while for the wet season is between 0 84 and 2 17 according to todd 1980 described irrigation water having sar values below 10 to be excellent for irrigation uses the amount of magnesium in the water is regarded as another most very useful index in classifying the quality of water for irrigation it is generally observed that magnesium and calcium in most of the cases maintain a state of equilibrium in the water but when there is an increase in the level of salinity of the water it then causes a decline in the crop productivity joshi et al 2009 the values of mar obtained for dry season in this work is between 38 1 and 67 7 while for the wet season ranges between 24 0 and 57 1 though there are high values for mar in some water samples which above recommended limits of 50 by ayers and westcott 1985 soluble sodium percentage ssp give an estimate on the amount of sodium ions available in the water which shows an indication of possible hazard that might results from the accumulation of sodium ions the ssp also serves as important indices in classifying suitability of water for irrigation joshi et al 2009 explained that large amount of sodium in the water for irrigation will give a plant a stunt growth and also reduce permeability in the soil values obtained for ssp ranges from 26 9 to 75 9 for dry season while ranges from 39 9 to 66 3 for the wet season and based on the value given by wilcox 1948 recommended limit of 80 and those values obtained in this work are less than 80 therefore they are good for irrigation high percentage value of residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc increases or causes high rate in the ph values and any kind of soil irrigated with this kind of water will results to the infertility due to the presence of sodium bicarbonates eaton 1950 however those values obtained for rsbc in this work is between 0 03 1 21 for dry season while from 0 05 1 66 for the wet season and these values considered to be good for irrigation based on the standard limits of 2 5 meg l 5 conclusion and recommendation this work has provided information on the physico chemical characteristics of shallow aquifer wells in the rural area of ilorin northcentral nigeria from the analysis of water samples the ph values indicated that water in the area is acidic to alkaline type and all the ph values falls within the acceptable and recommended limits for domestic uses also concluded that all other parameters tested both physical and chemical parameters are within the permissible limits therefore making the water to be suitable for any kind of domestic use although it is observed from the studies that most of these chemical constituents present in the water sampled have been influenced by the geological formation of parent rocks in the area but all the studied wells in the area still makes positive compliance and suitable for domestic uses results obtained for irrigation parameters indicates that the water samples in the area are suitable for irrigation though expected that there would be some anthropogenic influences but those expected influences are not apparent and have no much effects in the water analysed this work recommended that those existing shallow hand dug wells in the study area should have continuous monitoring against environmental influence especially by reconstructing some of the wells aprons for proper well covering it is also recommended that both the government and private individual should assist in constructing and develop good borehole wells in the study area as shallow hand dug wells do not meet the demand of water by villagers for domestic and irrigation purposes appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1

12218,the suitability of water for any use depends on its level of quality which can be influenced by several factors this research determined the quality of shallow hand dug wells for domestic and irrigation uses in the rural localities of ilorin northcentral nigeria twenty 20 water samples were collected from shallow hand dug wells in the study area during wet and dry seasons the water samples were assessed for physical and chemical qualities results indicates that ph of water samples is acidic to alkaline which ranges between 6 7 and 7 6 in dry season and ranges from 6 6 to 7 2 for wet season the ph values fall within the permissible limits of world health organization who standards and nigerian drinking water quality standards ndwqs quality standards of chemical parameters analysed in the water samples falls within the permissible limits mghco3 is considered as the most dominant water type in both seasons magnesium occurrence was traced to the disintegration of rock minerals while dominance of bicarbonates in the water contributed mostly by carbon dioxide charged recharge water during precipitation irrigation parameters tested includes soluble sodium percentage ssp

direct influence on human life the quality of groundwater resource is of great important whether for industrial domestic or for agricultural uses presently reliability on groundwater for drinking is used by more than fifty percent of the world s population including those who live in the rural areas of developing world tatawat and chandel 2008 one of the largest uses of groundwater is also in the area of crop irrigations in the rural farming system where some water resource sources such as dam canal or river are not available therefore the quality of groundwater is very important in such area see tables 9 12 current analysis has proved that groundwater getspolluted drastically by various factors which include anthropogenic sources such as improper disposes of sewage waste garbage which have caused a lot of water borne diseases cholera typhoid diarrhoea viral haemorrhagic fever agricultural wastes from the use of pesticides insecticides and fertilizers which often dispersed over large area could infiltrates and causes threat to the fresh groundwater ecosystem rao and prasanthi 2012 pollution of groundwater can also occur through natural sources such as soil that possess some high level of heavy metals which could leached into the groundwater and also has been established that geology play an important role in the chemistry of groundwater as the hosting lithologies contribute most of the cations and anions observed in the groundwater abimbola et al 2002 groundwater pollution also results from industrial effluent discharges remediation of groundwater contamination is thus very difficult except in some defined small area but most emphasis on the groundwater contamination remediation is placed on prevention before contamination occurs the study intends to highlig highlight quality status in the shallow aquifer hand dug wells of the study area with their hydrochemical dynamics as well as those factors influence its quality in this study shallow aquifer hand dug wells were assessed for their concentrations of inorganic substances shallow hand dug wells are targeted in this research because it is the main source of water supply in this study area and also it is generally believed that shallow permeable water table aquifers are the most susceptible to contamination 2 study area the study area is a rural community situated in ilorin area of kwara state in the northcentral part of nigeria it is bounded by latitude 8 32 and 8 36 and longitude 4 39 and 4 43 which falls within the basement complex of nigeria fig 1 people in the study area rely on a shallow hand dug wells as their primary source of water for domestic and irrigations uses the geology of the area is underlain by crystalline rocks of basement complex different types of crystalline rocks are found in various parts of the study area among which are migmatite gneiss banded gneiss granite gneiss augen gneiss quartzites older granites and also observed are the intrusions of pegmatitic rocks the crystalline rocks possess porosities of less than 3 bouwer 1978 rocks of basement complex when not weathered are not permeable and produce no storage capacity 3 materials and methods twenty 20 groundwater samples were randomly collected from shallow hand dug wells in the study area fig 2 these water samples were taken from different places in the study area purposely to have a wide coverage of the sampling sampling exercise was carried out for both wet and dry seasons the first water sampling was carried out in the middle of march representing the peak of dry season while the second water sampling was conducted in late september that represent maximum period of rain season because sampling involving two seasons will allow groundwater elemental concentration monitoring it is observed that the quality status of water sampled for a particular season of a given well may or may not actually represent the same quality status when later sampled for the same well in another season period 4 results and discussions 4 1 domestic use water samples collected from the wells were analysed for their major cation and anion concentrations the physical analysis of the water samples was taken directly on the field while chemical analysis was conducted in the chemistry department university of ilorin ilorin nigeria anions were analysed by means of convectional titration methods while cations were determined using standard methods of atomic absorption spectrophotometry a statistical summary for the physico chemical analyses of the sampled wells in the study area is presented in table 1 the interpretation of physical and chemical parameters for domestic use was based on world health organization standards who 2011 for potable water according to satpathy et al 1987 westbrook et al 2005 frohlich et al 2008 kim et al 2009 and vengosh 2013 described different processes and factors that could aid hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater to include anthropogenic contamination ion exchange dissolution and dilution water rock interaction and interaction of seawater especially through the precipitation and salinisation the ph values for the analysed water samples found between 6 7 and 7 6 for the dry season having a mean of 7 1 while ranges from 6 6 to 7 2 in wet season with a mean of 6 9 the ph for the both seasons is within the acceptable permissible limits by w h o 2011 standard of 6 5 8 5 therefore the ph in the study area is acidic to alkaline in nature electrical conductivity of the water samples tested in the area ranges between 106 and 318 μs cm and a mean of 209 2 μs cm for dry season while for the wet season ranges between 119 and 379 μs cm and a mean of 226 6 μs cm the ec for the two seasons falls within the world health organization w h o 2011 permissible standards for drinking water which is 1000 μs cm however some traces of high amount of ec in sampled water could be attributed to the presence of some metallic ore in the basement rocks within the area total dissolve solids tds in the water samples for dry season found between 96 and 176 mg l with a mean of 126 6 and 107 176 mg l of a mean 132 2 mg l for the wet season for the two seasons tds is within the acceptable limits of 1000 mg l w h o 2011 therefore with tds water in the area is suitable for drinking one of the strong effects of having high percentage value of tds in water is gastro intestinal irritation and can also causes stains of fabric olusiji and adeyinka 2010 total hardness in the sampled water for the dry season ranges between 7 2 and 18 6 mg l with a mean of 11 6 mg l and 8 4 22 4 of a mean 13 1 for the wet season based on the standard permissible limit of w h o 2011 which is 500 mg l the water for both seasons is soft and considered to be fit for human consumption most of the occurrence of hardness in water associated with the presence of high amount in magnesium and calcium ions mg and ca2 turbidity of 5 0 ntu usually recommended for portable water but for the sampled water in dry season ranges between 2 0 and 3 0 with a mean of 2 3 while between 2 0 and 3 2 of a mean of 2 5 for wet season and this shows that turbidity for those considered seasons are falls within the maximum acceptable standards of who calcium values in the analysed water is between 1 0 and 5 4 mg l with a mean of 2 9 mg l for the dry season while ranges between 2 2 and 10 8 mg l of a mean 5 6 mg l based on the w h o 2011 standard for calcium in drinking water there is no specific limitations but on the side of nigerian standards drinking water quality nsdwq 2007 the allowable permissible limit for calcium should not exceed 75 mg l water samples in the area for the both seasons falls within the acceptable level of nsdwq calcium ca and magnesium mg are found in large quantities in some brine in some cases high amount of calcium within the earth crust could responsible for its presence in the groundwater also almost all natural waters including seawater contain either or both calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate calcium occurs in many other silicate minerals that are present in the rocks such as garnet epidote titanite and wollastonite magnesium contents in the samples for the dry season is between 1 6 and 6 3 mg l with a mean of 3 2 mg l while ranges between 2 2 and 9 4 mg l with a mean of 4 7 mg l when compared with a standard given by who of 20 mg l magnesium in the analysed water for the two seasons found to be suitable for any domestic purpose high presence of magnesium in water results from leaching of ferromagnesian minerals like biotite olivine that present in the rocks magnesium also forms in groundwater when there is a contact between some certain rocks and groundwater especially carbonate minerals as they do occur in natural water sodium values in the water for the dry season ranges from 2 4 to 8 4 mg l with a mean of 4 5 mg l and for the wet season ranges between 4 4 and 6 5 mg l having a mean of 3 9 mg l the w h o 2011 recommended limits for sodium is 200 mg l therefore all the water samples in both the seasons are found with the acceptable standard limits making the water in the area to be suitable and fit for human consumption potassium permissible limit in the drinking water was not specified by w h o 2011 but consideration was based on the nigerian drinking water quality standards ndwqs 2007 limit of 10 mg l for the dry season the potassium concentration in the water ranges from 5 9 to 10 8 mg l with a mean of 8 3 mg l and for the wet season found between 5 6 and 10 6 mg l of a mean 8 1 mg l it was observed that in some locations like 13 14 16 and 20 in the two seasons there was high level in potassium concentrations and these were attributed to the abundance of potassium in some mineral vein intrusions that are present in the most basement rocks in the area like pegmatite intrusions in migmatite outcrops of the area concentrations of chloride in the sampled water for the dry season are between 6 6 and 13 8 mg l with a mean of 10 2 mg l while for the wet season ranges from 4 2 to 9 8 mg l with a mean of 6 0 mg l however who maximum permissible limits for the chloride is 250 mg l water samples in the two considered seasons are found with the standard acceptable limits some of the sources of chloride presence in water include human wastes fertilizers and dissolution of magmatic rocks freeze and cherry 1979 also some other source of chloride in the water involves recharge from meteoric water weathering from underlying basement rocks olusiji and adeyinka 2010 bicarbonates values ranges from 12 5 to 84 9 mg l with a mean of 34 9 mg l for the dry season and ranges from 16 8 to 108 2 mg l with a mean of 44 0 mg l there is no specific limit provided by the w h o 2011 for bicarbonates in water but it was observed that most of the bicarbonate ion occurrence in the water results from the dissolution of carbonate rocks carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or from respiration of aquatic organisms sulphate concentration values in the dry season of analysed water samples is between 12 4 and 28 3 mg l with a mean of 21 8 mg l and for the wet season ranges from 7 6 to 22 6 mg l having a mean of 19 0 mg l the standard limit by the w h o 2011 for sulphate in water is 250 mg l those values for the water sample within the seasons considered falls in the standard limits some trace of sulphate in the water sampled in the area might have resulted from some improper disposing of solid and liquid wastes in the area and also by unlawful use of chemical like fertilizers by the farmers in the area though sulphates also occur in natural water nitrate concentration ranges between 1 5 and 4 1 mg l with a mean of 2 8 mg l for dry season while ranges from 0 4 to 2 9 mg l of a mean 2 0 mg l for the wet season who acceptable standard for nitrate in water is 50 mg l therefore all the water samples in the area for the two concerned seasons are within the acceptable limit minor traces of nitrates in water of the study area implies that there is just little impact from agricultural practices in the area and small effects of sewage dispose in the area nitrates could also occur in the soil naturally through degradation of microbes in nitrogenous organic material like protein iron levels in the dry season of sampled water is found between 0 1 and 0 8 mg l with a mean of 0 4 mg l while for the wet season is from 0 1 0 0 3 mg l with a mean of 0 08 mg l standard recommended level by the w h o 2011 for iron is 3 0 mg l therefore water samples in the area for both seasons are within the acceptable limits which signifies that the water in the area is good for human health some traces of few occurrence of iron in water of the area probably due to the weathering of iron mineral rocks like garnets magnetite amphibolite that are present in the area main water types in the area were determined based on the percentage of each cation and anion present in the water in milliequivalent per litre as shown in table 2 and table 3 which later presented on the piper diagram piper 1944 as shwon in fig 3 mghco3 is considered as the most dominant water type in the area for both two seasons the most possibly factor that responsible for the geochemical processes in the water type in this area is the dissolution of minerals in the various rock types that are found in the area further evidence in supporting water rock interaction as the main factor for the geochemical processes of groundwater chemistry in the area is shown in the plotted gibbs 1970 diagram in fig 4 occurrence of magnesium mg2 also results from the breakdown of some mineralogical components that are present in the rocks which includes minerals like biotite hornblende pyroxene and olivine dominance of bicarbonates in the water contributed mostly by the carbon dioxide charged recharge water during precipitation mg2 ca2 and hc03 play roles in the chemistry of groundwater through the dissolution of carbonate rocks while silicate weathering regarded as the process behind some amount of na and k that present in the water other prominent water type in the area is mgs04 and presence of sulphates in this water attributed to the use of some harmful farm chemicals like fertilizers pesticides by the farmers in the area though sulphates also occur in natural water 4 2 saturation indices the major elements and trace metals are transported in the chemical elements through groundwater both anion and cation concentrations that are present in groundwater form complex association therefore aqueous complexes formations are very necessary in describing aquifer characteristics because both toxicity and bioavailability of metals that are usually occur in water are based on the aqueous speciation or complexation of the metal langmuir 1997 saturation indices si is useful to determine possible chemical reaction and to measure some level of chemical departures from the thermodynamic equilibrium between the aquifer and minerals present saturation index si of water samples was calculated using below equation 1 si log10 iap ksp where iap refers to as the ion activity product and ksp is the solubility product at a given temperature however the saturation index si in a particular mineral indicates whether the groundwater is undersaturated with respect to the mineral in question when the value of si is below 0 it is at the equilibrium with the mineral when calculated value of si is 0 or regarded to be supersaturated aqueous solution with respect to the mineral in question when it is greater than 0 consecutively if the groundwater is considered to be undersaturated with respect to the mineral as been showed with a negative si this means that the groundwater would theoretically dissolve that particular mineral concerned but if the groundwater is supersaturated with respect to a particular mineral this implies that the mineral would precipitate from the groundwater though there are still some uncertainties which are associated with the range values of si that indicates equilibrium phases due to some anomalies from the field measured of ph values laboratory analysed concentration of ions ionic strength and equilibrium constants that are involved during calculations of si parameters langmuir 1997 in this research a geochemical program called phreeqc developed by parkhurst and appelo 1999 was applied in calculating si values for twenty 20 hand dug well samples collected from the study area in both wet and dry seasons table 4 and table 5 results from si calculated values shows water in the study area for two considered seasons wet and dry seasons are greatly undersaturated with respect to anhydrite cas04 gypsum caso4 2h2o and halite nacl which means that these minerals will continue to dissolve in the water the water is supersaturated with respect to the calcite aragonite and dolomite the over saturation of these minerals most especially dolomite results from presence of calcium and magnesium in the water calcium ca and magnesium mg are found in large quantities in some brine in some cases high amount of calcium within the earth crust could responsible for its presence in the groundwater also almost all natural waters including seawater contain either or both calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate calcium also forms in many silicate minerals that present in the rocks like garnet epidote titanite and wollastonite magnesium occurrence in the water is possibly results from the dissolution of mineral rocks ferromagnesian minerals such as biotite and olivine in the area as it been observed from a high concentration of magnesium in the water samples and magnesium rich groundwater containing a significant amount of salt is also thought to be essential for dolomite formation 4 3 irrigation use the parameters used in the characterization of shallow wells for irrigation in this work are soluble sodium percentage ssp residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc which were calculated based on approach given by todd 1980 and gupta 1987 sodium absorption ratio sar was calculated using richards 1954 magnesium adsorption ratio mar calculated based on raghunath 1987 as well as total dissolved solids tds richards 1954 as shown in table 6 and table 7 based on the following equations 2 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 3 s s p n a k c a 2 m g 2 n a k 100 4 rsbc hc03 2 ca2 5 m a r m g 2 c a 2 m g 2 100 joshi et al 2009 explained that high concentration of electrical conductance ec causes reduction in the amount of water going to the plants ec provide status of salinity hazard in water and its effects on the productivity of crops the ec values obtained in this work ranges between 106 and 318 μs cm with a mean of 209 2 μs cm for the dry season while for the wet season ranges between 119 and 379 μs cm with a mean of 226 6 μs c and all these values are within the acceptable limits of 1000 μs cm w h o 2011 based on the description by richard 1954 who described that water can only be used for irrigation only when its possess low to moderate saline water fig 5 total dissolved solids tds obtained from the water samples for dry season is between 96 and 176 mg l with a mean of 126 6 and 107 176 mg l of a mean 132 2 mg l for the wet season for the two seasons tds is within the acceptable limits of 1000 mg l therefore with tds water in the area is suitable for irrigation also based on the classification of robinove et al 1958 this water is regarded as non saline and considered to be excellent for irrigation see fig 6 sodium absorption ratio sar value for each of analysed water samples was determined based on the richard 1954 as described above however sodium hazard is generally expressed as the sodium adsorption ratio sar the sar shows specific amount of sodium calcium and magnesium ions that are present in the water for this work the sar ranges from 1 2 to 3 5 for the dry season while for the wet season is between 0 84 and 2 17 according to todd 1980 described irrigation water having sar values below 10 to be excellent for irrigation uses the amount of magnesium in the water is regarded as another most very useful index in classifying the quality of water for irrigation it is generally observed that magnesium and calcium in most of the cases maintain a state of equilibrium in the water but when there is an increase in the level of salinity of the water it then causes a decline in the crop productivity joshi et al 2009 the values of mar obtained for dry season in this work is between 38 1 and 67 7 while for the wet season ranges between 24 0 and 57 1 though there are high values for mar in some water samples which above recommended limits of 50 by ayers and westcott 1985 soluble sodium percentage ssp give an estimate on the amount of sodium ions available in the water which shows an indication of possible hazard that might results from the accumulation of sodium ions the ssp also serves as important indices in classifying suitability of water for irrigation joshi et al 2009 explained that large amount of sodium in the water for irrigation will give a plant a stunt growth and also reduce permeability in the soil values obtained for ssp ranges from 26 9 to 75 9 for dry season while ranges from 39 9 to 66 3 for the wet season and based on the value given by wilcox 1948 recommended limit of 80 and those values obtained in this work are less than 80 therefore they are good for irrigation high percentage value of residual sodium bicarbonate rsbc increases or causes high rate in the ph values and any kind of soil irrigated with this kind of water will results to the infertility due to the presence of sodium bicarbonates eaton 1950 however those values obtained for rsbc in this work is between 0 03 1 21 for dry season while from 0 05 1 66 for the wet season and these values considered to be good for irrigation based on the standard limits of 2 5 meg l 5 conclusion and recommendation this work has provided information on the physico chemical characteristics of shallow aquifer wells in the rural area of ilorin northcentral nigeria from the analysis of water samples the ph values indicated that water in the area is acidic to alkaline type and all the ph values falls within the acceptable and recommended limits for domestic uses also concluded that all other parameters tested both physical and chemical parameters are within the permissible limits therefore making the water to be suitable for any kind of domestic use although it is observed from the studies that most of these chemical constituents present in the water sampled have been influenced by the geological formation of parent rocks in the area but all the studied wells in the area still makes positive compliance and suitable for domestic uses results obtained for irrigation parameters indicates that the water samples in the area are suitable for irrigation though expected that there would be some anthropogenic influences but those expected influences are not apparent and have no much effects in the water analysed this work recommended that those existing shallow hand dug wells in the study area should have continuous monitoring against environmental influence especially by reconstructing some of the wells aprons for proper well covering it is also recommended that both the government and private individual should assist in constructing and develop good borehole wells in the study area as shallow hand dug wells do not meet the demand of water by villagers for domestic and irrigation purposes appendix a supplementary data the following is the supplementary data to this article multimedia component 1

12219,hard rock aquifers are characterized by high heterogeneity which leads to difficulties in boreholes implementation in the eastern region of côte d ivoire this is due to the combination of many factors including poor knowledge of hydrogeological environment the thrust of this study is to highlight the influence of borehole depth lithotypes weathering thickness and electrical resistivity of the geological structures on borehole productivity that exploit the crystalline aquifer systems in n zi iffou and moronou regions bivariate analysis was used to determine the relationships between these factors and specific capacity values for measuring borehole productivity the values ranged from 0 02 to 4 09 m3 h 1 m 1 the analysis shows that there is no correlation between productivity and weathering thickness however weathering depths between 10 and 69 m provide the highest specific capacity values schist is more productive than granite for hydrogeological discontinuities interest boreholes located in h and kh anomaly curve types were the most productive as productivity diminishes with depth a deeper borehole can be more productive if it reaches a geological structure that is favorable for groundwater flow those geological and hydrogeological parameters are extremely important in borehole productivity in the above mentioned regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords hard rock aquifer fractured layer conducive fissures groundwater occurrence borehole discharge côte d ivoire 1 introduction to meet the demand of growing population size in terms of water resources and to tackle the issue of industrialization fast urbanization and agriculture the quality and the volume of surface water are threatened disposal of various types of wastes is conducive to surface water contamination in the words of singh et al 2005 mastropietro et al 2016 frontera et al 2013 candamano et al 2019 contaminant levels must be reduced by proper treatments and materials the shrink of surface water resources is due to the excessive use and seasonal changes consequently looking for new water resources is vital for population studies like atwia et al 2013 jellalia et al 2013 anomohanran 2015 abu risha and temamy 2016 anaba onana et al 2017 haj amor et al 2018 hamad et al 2018 boujghad et al 2019 and el baghdadi et al 2019 showed that in many african cities groundwater is a vital water source outside of surface water resources looking for groundwater resources and the wise management of these resources are fundamental for sustainable development for reliable water sources supply for urban and rural areas developing crystalline bedrock aquifers as reliable sources of water supply are not that easy groundwater occurrence is spatially and highly variable holland and witthuser 2011 studies about the behavior of groundwater in crystalline rocks have revealed that factors that influence the productivity of boreholes in these formations have not been well established or they vary according to the particular characteristics of the area neves and morales 2007 the depth of the boreholes the lithotypes the geological structures the topographic setting and weathering thickness are part of the most investigated factors considered as meaningful for borehole productivity these factors are tremendous for groundwater occurrence because they control fractures fault zones and the presence of higher porosity material holland and witthuser 2011 n zi iffou and moronou regions in côte d ivoire are located in an environment of crystalline rocks and are densely populated pressure on environment and on water resources is still tremendous the volume and quality of groundwater which is the main source of drinking water in rural and urban areas are threatened campaigns for supplying water through drilling have registered significant failure rate however few hydrogeological studies have been conducted in those regions thus there is a need to provide more insight into the hydrogeological characterization of crystalline formations in those regions this study analyzes the influence of four factors for the productivity of the boreholes that exploit the crystalline aquifer systems in n zi iffou and moronou regions borehole depth lithotypes weathering thickness and electrical resistivity of the geological structures 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is n zi iffou and moronou regions in the eastern region of côte d ivoire it covers the area between latitude 6 20 and 8 10 n and longitudes 3 40 and 4 55 w fig 1 the population is estimated at 911 836 inhabitants ins 2014 this area is under the influence of the wet tropical climate with two distinct seasons a long dry season november march and a long rainy season april october the study area is located in the proterozoic zone and covers 19560 km2 the geological bedrock consists of the volcano sedimentary and the granitoides which are essentially constituted by granites fig 1 the volcano sedimentary includes meta sediments mostly compoed of sandstone and schists intruded by several generations of granitoids the volcano sedimentary is covered by metavulcanites which consist of amphibolites meta andesite rhyolites meta basaltes metagabbro and metadolerite two aquifers are indicated in the study area for groundwater extraction the most important aquifers are the fractured aquifers of crystalline and schist rocks their permeability depends on the discontinuities such as faults and joints and in some cases by lithlogic contacts neves 2005 over the fractured rocks the weathered layer may be a porous aquifer 2 2 data collection the dataset for the study consisted of 125 boreholes from the uemoa project database of n zi iffou and moronou regions fig 1 the parameters taken into account are rock type borehole yield q m3 h borehole depth m weathering depth m water level in the borehole after equipment m resistivity data of the geological structures and specific capacity qs m3 h 1 m 1 which are determined from the interpretation of pumping tests pumping tests were conducted for 48 h and drawdown was measured directly in the pumping borehole as constructing an observation piezometer would roughly cost the same price for drilling consequently the state drilled a water supply borehole at another locality instead of drilling an observation piezometer we also used resistivity data from sixty one horizontal profiling and vertical electrical sounding using the schlumberger array the electrical resistivity methods are used as described by nazaya and singh 2018 and massing et al 2017 these methods consist in setting a direct current in the soil using electrodes a and b and measuring the potential difference between the two other electrodes m and n including between a and b the electrical profiling is the preliminary method to any geoelectric study and is the basis for the activation of other electrical implementations in this study the electrical profiling was used to monitor the lateral continuity of layers for a given position and enabled to confirm the effectiveness or not of conductive anomalies bakkali and bouyalaoui 2005 the electrical profiling was conducted according to the schlumberger mechanism with the following geometric features ab 300 m mn 20 m with a 10 m measurement step vertical electrical sounding ves is performed at the location where the conductive anomaly was detected that is to quantify the thickness and the resistivity of both the saprolitic and the stratiform fractured layers the apparent resistivity ρ a values obtained from the survey are estimated as follows equation 1 1 ρ a π a b 2 2 m n 2 2 m n δ v i where ρ a is the apparent resistivity δv and i are the potential difference measured between the potential electrodes volts and the applied current strength milliampere respectively ab represents the distance between the current electrodes meters mn is the distance between the potential electrodes meters the apparent resistivity values obtained from the survey are plotted against the half electrode spacing on a log log plot the initial interpretation of ves data is made using curve matching techniques utilizing master curves koefoed 1979 and the corresponding auxiliary curves orellana and mooney 1966 from which the resistivity values and thicknesses of the layers are obtained further interpretation of sounding data is made using ipi2win software 2 3 data analysis bivariate analysis was used to determine the relationships between the productivity of boreholes as specific capacity values and the depth of drilling rock type and the thickness of alteration as described by mayer et al 2014 correlation studies were carried out using the spearman correlation test it is a nonparametric technique for measuring the statistical dependence between two variables the method assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function the advantage of this test is that variables do not need to follow a normal distribution the method is not very sensitive to outliers and it is used for data collected on ordinal interval or ratio scales in addition to the correlation coefficient r standard hypothesis testing was conducted they tested the null hypothesis that the ranks of one variable do not covary with ranks of the other variable a significance level p value of 0 05 was used throughout the study bivariate analyses were conducted within semi log space with specific capacity on a logarithmic scale and hydrogeological and geological parameters on an arithmetic scale moreover we applied the yates chi square test to evaluate the influence of geophysical anomalies on the distribution of qs values yates chi square test χ y a t e s 2 is a statistical procedure whose result is evaluated by referring to the pearson s chi square distribution it tests a null hypothesis and the relative occurrence frequencies for observed events following a specified frequency distribution the events are considered as independent and have the same distribution and the outcomes of each event should be mutually exclusive pirhaji et al 2008 our objective is to find regions where the distribution of qs values is different or similar chi square statistic is calculated as follows mercier et al 2011 equation 2 2 χ y a t e s 2 i 1 n o i c i 0 5 2 c i where o i and c i are the observed and the expected numbers of the ith anomaly respectively the numerical value of χ y a t e s 2 is then compared with χ α n 1 2 in which is a point of chi square distribution with n 1 degrees of freedom we tested the null hypothesis to check if qs value is distributed randomly this is done both on the sounding genes profiling anomalies finally the mann whitney test was performed to compare specific capacity values between the resistivity sounding curve types and the resistivity profiling anomaly types in studied cities the mann whitney test is a nonparametric test for comparing two independent groups it assesses a null hypothesis that two data sets originate from the same population if p value is below 0 05 there is a statistically significant difference between the groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 borehole and hydrogeological characteristics the analysis of lithologs from the 125 boreholes shows 2 bedrock types granitoid granite and schists these various formations occupied 18 4 and 81 6 respectively specific capacity values ranged from 0 02 to 4 09 m3 h 1 m 1 table 1 seventy six percent 76 of the boreholes had their specific capacity in the range of 0 1 4 09 m3 h 1 m 1 during the period of study we used specific capacity value classes defined by lasm 2000 and we also notice that these boreholes have good productivity the regions in the study area were generally characterized by deeper boreholes as the depth varied from 42 83 to 134 97 m table 1 five resistivity profiling anomaly types suspected to be fractured faults and cracks boundaries were identified in the study area they are v u h k and w anomaly types the most prominent discontinuity types were the v anomalies with a frequency of about 41 the u anomaly types had 18 frequency followed by k 16 39 and h 11 47 while the w types recorded only about 1 64 four resistivity sounding curve types were delineated namely h curve types for 30 stations 49 18 kh curve types for 24 stations 39 34 a curve types for 4 stations 6 56 and hkh curve types for 3 stations 4 92 table 2 3 2 lithotypes to check the influence of rock type on the borehole productivity specific capacity values were divided into two main categories granites and schists geological differences of qs values were clearly found the highest numbers of this parameter were recorded in boreholes water extraction from schists as their low values were found in granites indeed 86 boreholes on 102 eighty four percent of boreholes drilled in schists and thirty three percent of boreholes in granites attained qs values of 0 1 4 09 m3 h 1 m 1 with the asymptotic fluctuation intervals at the threshold of 95 i s c h i s t s 0 677 0 843 and i g r a n i t e s 0 600 0 912 respectively table 3 the graph of cumulative frequencies of these rocks fig 2 shows that the values close to the 90 were identical for both rock types nevertheless the schists presented a remarkably higher distribution of values and the median is 0 21 m3 h 1 m 1 schists are rocks with a low resistance to brittle deformation anaba onana 2017 and are so highly fractured rocks researchers like biémi 1992 dibi et al 2004 n go et al 2005 youanta et al 2008 and soro 2010 concluded that in côte d ivoire a high productivity of schists compared to other rocks like granites subvertical to vertical position acquired by the schistose grooves following tectonics facilitate their alteration we also come to the same conclusion and it leads to uncontrolled cracking and ensures the aquifer specific capacity referring to dibi 2008 anaba onana 2017 has shown that in addition to their straightened character these schists have intercalations of carbonates quartz and pegmatite veins but these rocks can have micaceous minerals which along with clay minerals are obtained as weathering products and are to close the fractures when fractures are filled with clay or silty material the fracture permeability is considerably reduced this may explain the low specific capacity of some boreholes extracting water from schists 3 3 borehole depth fig 3 shows specific capacity value evolution with borehole depth borehole productivity had a low and negative correlation r 0 25 with borehole depths a low trend of decreasing borehole productivity with increasing depth is noticeable the influence of the depth on boreholes productivity from this study is consistent with neves and morales 2007 they found that in the jundiaí river catchment a tendency of decreasing well productivity with increasing depth exists but the correlation coefficient among the variables was considerably low for davis and turk 1964 and bank 1992 the reduction of the borehole productivity is due to the closure of discontinuities by lithostatic pressure to lower the density and connectivity of fractures with depth however in this study it is remarkable that aligned points indicating boreholes of identical depth 60 80 and 103 m for instance often present specific and distinct capacity values siding with neves and morales 2007 this leads to the borehole depth defined from contractual issues user s necessity and construction profits which sometimes prevail over possible productivity gains by increasing the depth thus it was not possible to define a best yielding depth interval although productivity tends to diminish with depth a deeper borehole can be more productive if it reaches a geological structure that is favorable to groundwater flow 3 4 weathering influence fig 4 shows the productivity of boreholes from the weathering depth there was no correlation between the depth of weathering and the specific capacity r 0 008 from this study neither the nature of the regolith nor the rock in which it was formed has been taken in account as a result in line with n go et al 2005 and anaba onana et al 2017 a correlation between specific capacity and weathering depth can be verified or identified as highlighted by the experimental data in this study we note that high specific capacity values qs 1 m3 h 1 m 1 were concentrated where the weathered layer was 10 69 m thick similar results were obtained by n go et al 2005 and youanta et al 2008 in côte d ivoire and anaba onana 2017 in cameroon these researchers observed general medium and high yield between 5 and 45 m of regolith thickness 3 5 electrical resistivity anomalies fig 5 shows the distribution of qs values from the resistivity sounding curve types and the resistivity profiling anomaly types qs values varied from 0 04 to 2 49 m3 h 1 m 1 in h curve types and from 0 02 to 1 42 m3 h 1 m 1 in kh curve types in both a and hkh curve types qs values varied from 0 to 0 26 m3 h 1 m 1 and from 0 03 to 0 14 m3 h 1 m 1 respectively fig 5 1 spatial differences of qs values were clearly found the highest values of qs were recorded in h and kh curve types while their low levels were found in a and hkh curve types whatever the bedrock nature fig 5 1 the upward trends and downward trends were recorded between qs values and u v anomaly types and h k w anomaly types respectively fig 5 2 the results of the distribution of qs values following the resistivity sounding curve types are consistent to the chi square independence test the test result indicated a significant relationship between qs values and resistivity sounding curve types p 0 05 while no significant difference was observed between the resistivity profiling anomaly types in term of qs distribution p 0 09 0 05 table 4 thus we posit that the ves sites influence borehole productivity moreover the mann whitney test revealed that the probability of boreholes qs values exceeding 0 1 m2 h 1 and 1 m2 h 1 was higher in h and kh curve types than in the other curve types when qs values were low qs 0 1 m2 h 1 there was no significant difference between ves sites table 5 our findings are in agreement with those reported by kouassi et al 2013 coulibaly et al 2014 koïta et al 2016 and kouakou et al 2017 the sounding anomalies of h and kh types may reflect the discontinuities and geological structures effectiveness such as vein zones fractures faults and geological contacts for the fractured aquifer permeability in the crystalline bedrock however in line with neves and morales 2007 the location close to these structures does not indicate that a borehole built there should be highly productive it is necessary to locate the boreholes at a favorable position in relation with the structural dipping with a depth that can reach the geological structure in the subsurface furthermore the movement of the structure should be favorable to opening via tectonical stresses 4 conclusion the main parameter used in this study to measure borehole productivity was the specific capacity which was grouped from the drilling depths weathering depth rock type and electrical resistivity anomalies schists seemed to be the most productive rocks it was not possible to define a best yielding depth interval as well depth is mainly defined by the driller s and user s needs although productivity decreases with depth a deeper borehole could be more productive if it reached a geological structure in subsurface that is favorable to groundwater flow the most productive boreholes were obtained from weathering thicknesses between 10 5 and 68 5 m boreholes located in h and kh anomaly curve types were more productive than in the other curve types this study can be used as a work reference for future groundwater development programs for prospective studies additional data should be collected and be used to analyze the hydrogeological importance of each parameter on groundwater occurrence in the eastern regions of côte d ivoire

12219,hard rock aquifers are characterized by high heterogeneity which leads to difficulties in boreholes implementation in the eastern region of côte d ivoire this is due to the combination of many factors including poor knowledge of hydrogeological environment the thrust of this study is to highlight the influence of borehole depth lithotypes weathering thickness and electrical resistivity of the geological structures on borehole productivity that exploit the crystalline aquifer systems in n zi iffou and moronou regions bivariate analysis was used to determine the relationships between these factors and specific capacity values for measuring borehole productivity the values ranged from 0 02 to 4 09 m3 h 1 m 1 the analysis shows that there is no correlation between productivity and weathering thickness however weathering depths between 10 and 69 m provide the highest specific capacity values schist is more productive than granite for hydrogeological discontinuities interest boreholes located in h and kh anomaly curve types were the most productive as productivity diminishes with depth a deeper borehole can be more productive if it reaches a geological structure that is favorable for groundwater flow those geological and hydrogeological parameters are extremely important in borehole productivity in the above mentioned regions graphical abstract image 1 keywords hard rock aquifer fractured layer conducive fissures groundwater occurrence borehole discharge côte d ivoire 1 introduction to meet the demand of growing population size in terms of water resources and to tackle the issue of industrialization fast urbanization and agriculture the quality and the volume of surface water are threatened disposal of various types of wastes is conducive to surface water contamination in the words of singh et al 2005 mastropietro et al 2016 frontera et al 2013 candamano et al 2019 contaminant levels must be reduced by proper treatments and materials the shrink of surface water resources is due to the excessive use and seasonal changes consequently looking for new water resources is vital for population studies like atwia et al 2013 jellalia et al 2013 anomohanran 2015 abu risha and temamy 2016 anaba onana et al 2017 haj amor et al 2018 hamad et al 2018 boujghad et al 2019 and el baghdadi et al 2019 showed that in many african cities groundwater is a vital water source outside of surface water resources looking for groundwater resources and the wise management of these resources are fundamental for sustainable development for reliable water sources supply for urban and rural areas developing crystalline bedrock aquifers as reliable sources of water supply are not that easy groundwater occurrence is spatially and highly variable holland and witthuser 2011 studies about the behavior of groundwater in crystalline rocks have revealed that factors that influence the productivity of boreholes in these formations have not been well established or they vary according to the particular characteristics of the area neves and morales 2007 the depth of the boreholes the lithotypes the geological structures the topographic setting and weathering thickness are part of the most investigated factors considered as meaningful for borehole productivity these factors are tremendous for groundwater occurrence because they control fractures fault zones and the presence of higher porosity material holland and witthuser 2011 n zi iffou and moronou regions in côte d ivoire are located in an environment of crystalline rocks and are densely populated pressure on environment and on water resources is still tremendous the volume and quality of groundwater which is the main source of drinking water in rural and urban areas are threatened campaigns for supplying water through drilling have registered significant failure rate however few hydrogeological studies have been conducted in those regions thus there is a need to provide more insight into the hydrogeological characterization of crystalline formations in those regions this study analyzes the influence of four factors for the productivity of the boreholes that exploit the crystalline aquifer systems in n zi iffou and moronou regions borehole depth lithotypes weathering thickness and electrical resistivity of the geological structures 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is n zi iffou and moronou regions in the eastern region of côte d ivoire it covers the area between latitude 6 20 and 8 10 n and longitudes 3 40 and 4 55 w fig 1 the population is estimated at 911 836 inhabitants ins 2014 this area is under the influence of the wet tropical climate with two distinct seasons a long dry season november march and a long rainy season april october the study area is located in the proterozoic zone and covers 19560 km2 the geological bedrock consists of the volcano sedimentary and the granitoides which are essentially constituted by granites fig 1 the volcano sedimentary includes meta sediments mostly compoed of sandstone and schists intruded by several generations of granitoids the volcano sedimentary is covered by metavulcanites which consist of amphibolites meta andesite rhyolites meta basaltes metagabbro and metadolerite two aquifers are indicated in the study area for groundwater extraction the most important aquifers are the fractured aquifers of crystalline and schist rocks their permeability depends on the discontinuities such as faults and joints and in some cases by lithlogic contacts neves 2005 over the fractured rocks the weathered layer may be a porous aquifer 2 2 data collection the dataset for the study consisted of 125 boreholes from the uemoa project database of n zi iffou and moronou regions fig 1 the parameters taken into account are rock type borehole yield q m3 h borehole depth m weathering depth m water level in the borehole after equipment m resistivity data of the geological structures and specific capacity qs m3 h 1 m 1 which are determined from the interpretation of pumping tests pumping tests were conducted for 48 h and drawdown was measured directly in the pumping borehole as constructing an observation piezometer would roughly cost the same price for drilling consequently the state drilled a water supply borehole at another locality instead of drilling an observation piezometer we also used resistivity data from sixty one horizontal profiling and vertical electrical sounding using the schlumberger array the electrical resistivity methods are used as described by nazaya and singh 2018 and massing et al 2017 these methods consist in setting a direct current in the soil using electrodes a and b and measuring the potential difference between the two other electrodes m and n including between a and b the electrical profiling is the preliminary method to any geoelectric study and is the basis for the activation of other electrical implementations in this study the electrical profiling was used to monitor the lateral continuity of layers for a given position and enabled to confirm the effectiveness or not of conductive anomalies bakkali and bouyalaoui 2005 the electrical profiling was conducted according to the schlumberger mechanism with the following geometric features ab 300 m mn 20 m with a 10 m measurement step vertical electrical sounding ves is performed at the location where the conductive anomaly was detected that is to quantify the thickness and the resistivity of both the saprolitic and the stratiform fractured layers the apparent resistivity ρ a values obtained from the survey are estimated as follows equation 1 1 ρ a π a b 2 2 m n 2 2 m n δ v i where ρ a is the apparent resistivity δv and i are the potential difference measured between the potential electrodes volts and the applied current strength milliampere respectively ab represents the distance between the current electrodes meters mn is the distance between the potential electrodes meters the apparent resistivity values obtained from the survey are plotted against the half electrode spacing on a log log plot the initial interpretation of ves data is made using curve matching techniques utilizing master curves koefoed 1979 and the corresponding auxiliary curves orellana and mooney 1966 from which the resistivity values and thicknesses of the layers are obtained further interpretation of sounding data is made using ipi2win software 2 3 data analysis bivariate analysis was used to determine the relationships between the productivity of boreholes as specific capacity values and the depth of drilling rock type and the thickness of alteration as described by mayer et al 2014 correlation studies were carried out using the spearman correlation test it is a nonparametric technique for measuring the statistical dependence between two variables the method assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function the advantage of this test is that variables do not need to follow a normal distribution the method is not very sensitive to outliers and it is used for data collected on ordinal interval or ratio scales in addition to the correlation coefficient r standard hypothesis testing was conducted they tested the null hypothesis that the ranks of one variable do not covary with ranks of the other variable a significance level p value of 0 05 was used throughout the study bivariate analyses were conducted within semi log space with specific capacity on a logarithmic scale and hydrogeological and geological parameters on an arithmetic scale moreover we applied the yates chi square test to evaluate the influence of geophysical anomalies on the distribution of qs values yates chi square test χ y a t e s 2 is a statistical procedure whose result is evaluated by referring to the pearson s chi square distribution it tests a null hypothesis and the relative occurrence frequencies for observed events following a specified frequency distribution the events are considered as independent and have the same distribution and the outcomes of each event should be mutually exclusive pirhaji et al 2008 our objective is to find regions where the distribution of qs values is different or similar chi square statistic is calculated as follows mercier et al 2011 equation 2 2 χ y a t e s 2 i 1 n o i c i 0 5 2 c i where o i and c i are the observed and the expected numbers of the ith anomaly respectively the numerical value of χ y a t e s 2 is then compared with χ α n 1 2 in which is a point of chi square distribution with n 1 degrees of freedom we tested the null hypothesis to check if qs value is distributed randomly this is done both on the sounding genes profiling anomalies finally the mann whitney test was performed to compare specific capacity values between the resistivity sounding curve types and the resistivity profiling anomaly types in studied cities the mann whitney test is a nonparametric test for comparing two independent groups it assesses a null hypothesis that two data sets originate from the same population if p value is below 0 05 there is a statistically significant difference between the groups 3 results and discussion 3 1 borehole and hydrogeological characteristics the analysis of lithologs from the 125 boreholes shows 2 bedrock types granitoid granite and schists these various formations occupied 18 4 and 81 6 respectively specific capacity values ranged from 0 02 to 4 09 m3 h 1 m 1 table 1 seventy six percent 76 of the boreholes had their specific capacity in the range of 0 1 4 09 m3 h 1 m 1 during the period of study we used specific capacity value classes defined by lasm 2000 and we also notice that these boreholes have good productivity the regions in the study area were generally characterized by deeper boreholes as the depth varied from 42 83 to 134 97 m table 1 five resistivity profiling anomaly types suspected to be fractured faults and cracks boundaries were identified in the study area they are v u h k and w anomaly types the most prominent discontinuity types were the v anomalies with a frequency of about 41 the u anomaly types had 18 frequency followed by k 16 39 and h 11 47 while the w types recorded only about 1 64 four resistivity sounding curve types were delineated namely h curve types for 30 stations 49 18 kh curve types for 24 stations 39 34 a curve types for 4 stations 6 56 and hkh curve types for 3 stations 4 92 table 2 3 2 lithotypes to check the influence of rock type on the borehole productivity specific capacity values were divided into two main categories granites and schists geological differences of qs values were clearly found the highest numbers of this parameter were recorded in boreholes water extraction from schists as their low values were found in granites indeed 86 boreholes on 102 eighty four percent of boreholes drilled in schists and thirty three percent of boreholes in granites attained qs values of 0 1 4 09 m3 h 1 m 1 with the asymptotic fluctuation intervals at the threshold of 95 i s c h i s t s 0 677 0 843 and i g r a n i t e s 0 600 0 912 respectively table 3 the graph of cumulative frequencies of these rocks fig 2 shows that the values close to the 90 were identical for both rock types nevertheless the schists presented a remarkably higher distribution of values and the median is 0 21 m3 h 1 m 1 schists are rocks with a low resistance to brittle deformation anaba onana 2017 and are so highly fractured rocks researchers like biémi

position acquired by the schistose grooves following tectonics facilitate their alteration we also come to the same conclusion and it leads to uncontrolled cracking and ensures the aquifer specific capacity referring to dibi 2008 anaba onana 2017 has shown that in addition to their straightened character these schists have intercalations of carbonates quartz and pegmatite veins but these rocks can have micaceous minerals which along with clay minerals are obtained as weathering products and are to close the fractures when fractures are filled with clay or silty material the fracture
