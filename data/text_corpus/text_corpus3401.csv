17005,in this work uv vis absorption spectrum of the membrane integrity analysis based on slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra differential absorbance spectroscopy das and absorption coefficient α 254 were studied at different number of breakage fibers and filtration times moreover we analyze the influence of fe2 and ca2 concentration on uv spectrum detection results cluster analysis and the change ratio rs were used to determine the dissolved organic matter dom leakage stages as a result the correlation coefficient between slope280 350 value and the number of breakage fibers is 0 901 seven gaussian bands were successfully model from the das and a4 312 nm a5 339 nm a6 367 nm were chosen to indicate the extent of breakage fiber peak 4 a4 is minimally affected by ions concentration the α 254 could be used as a good indicator for detecting industrial wastewater treatment process which correlation coefficient between the number of breakage fibers is 0 955 the dom leakage process was divided into three stages which were bulk leakage stage development stage and stabilization stage the uv vis absorption spectrum can effectively detect the membrane integrity more sensitive than particle counter and three analyse methods are suitable for different substance in feed water graphical abstract image graphical abstract key words uv vis spectrum membrane bioreactor differential absorbance spectra absorption coefficient membrane integrity test 1 introduction through these years membrane bioreactor mbr for wastewater treatment achieved rapid growth in practical application worldwide which with high effluent quality small footprint separation of solids retention time srt and hydraulic retention time hrt and low generation of mud xiao et al 2019 the ultrafiltration membrane could remove bacterial quite efficiently than conventional activated sludge cas processes and main highlights of the hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane include high specific surface area and membrane flux ferrer et al 2015 however during the operation process of the membrane system virus bacterial and macromolecular organic pollutants would pass through the breakage pore and enter the permeate if the membrane integrity is compromised numerous cases will contribute to the failure of membrane fibers such as inappropriate chemical cleaning and oxidative cleaning lipp et al 2009 mechanical breakage by particles or sharp materials wang et al 2016 fatigue damage caused by the impact of water flow and vigorous backwashing aging of the film material serious fouling status of the membrane gao et al 2019 pype et al 2016 and o ring failure or faulty installation the integrity of membrane must be effectively detected in time which is particularly important for the discharge of sewage and the safety of drinking water during the past decades large amount of studies conducted had already summarized that the membrane integrity testing methods were divided into three main groups direct methods indirect methods and surrogate challenge tests guo et al 2010a all these methods have their own advantages and disadvantages which were compared in table 1 the direct methods directly applied to the membrane itself for testing with high sensitivity which were suitable for the detection of a single module in the system direct methods include diffusive air flow test daf bubble point test bpt pressure decay test pdt acoustic sensor test liquid liquid porosimetry test and binary gas integrity test at present the pdt bpt and daf are the most widely used in engineering the bpt can also be used to determine the damaged location after the membrane integrity is compromised brehant et al 2010 phattaranawik et al 2008 shin et al 2016 the indirect methods mainly rely on the change of separation performance and effluent water quality to reflect the integrity of the membrane such as particle counting micro bubbles test particle monitoring and turbidity monitoring these methods are able to detect membrane integrity on line appropriate for any membrane system effectively and the operation is simple but the detection sensitivity is relatively low it is more suitable for the determination and early warning of the membrane module breakage suh et al 2011 troester et al 2014 the principle of the surrogate challenge tests is similar to the indirect methods mainly by introducing tracers with different characteristics into the feed water the tracer content can be used to judge the membrane separation performance with high sensitivity however the surrogate challenge tests are still limited by the choice of the medium tracer and the detection method what s more the safety performance needs to be verified the surrogate challenge tests include spiked integrity monitoring system simtm magnetic particle challenge test microbial challenge test fluorescent silica particles challenge test and the nanoscale probe challenge tests xin et al 2019 in fact spectral detection methods such as excitation emission matrix ultraviolet and visible uv vis absorbance spectrum and fourier transform infrared spectrum ft ir are extensively used in water quality test because of the advantages of high sensitivity strong selectivity no reagent application and no secondary pollution henderson et al 2009 liden et al 2016 however ft ir spectral is not suitable for the analysis of aqueous samples because of the hydroxyl peak in the water interferes with the measurement the fluorescence spectroscopy detection is prone to inner filter effect ife which need to be corrected and the sample needs to be diluted murphy et al 2010 in addition fluorescence quenching will also occur the ph and temperature of the system will affect the intensity of fluorescence the uv vis absorbance spectrum is easy to detect the changes in absorbance of water sample and it is less affected by the sample concentration therefore the uv vis absorbance spectrum is easier to realize on line monitoring xin et al 2020 noticeably it has been documented that uv vis absorbance spectrum is able to monitor natural organic matter nom effectively yamamura et al 2014 and it can be used to analysis the indication of membrane performance and measure the fouling propensity of nom zhou and meng 2015 synchronized uv vis spectroscopic can realize the qualitative analysis of foulants deposition process and membrane fouling in uf system gao et al 2018 uv vis spectral parameters for dissolved organic matter dom detection include absorbance spectral slope differential absorbance spectroscopy das and so on lavonen et al 2015 recent studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of dom chromophores to interactions with protons metal cations oxidants and the presence of prominent features in differential spectra can be resolved into gaussian bands in addition the quantization of kinetics and mechanisms of nom metal ions interactions could be studied through das and it also monitor them in practically important system gao et al 2015 slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra measured were used for the water quality monitoring change of dom and coagulation control beichen et al 2018 roccaro et al 2015 yan et al 2013 therefore uv vis absorbance spectrum plays an important role in the identification of organic matter in water treatment in this paper uv vis absorption spectrum was used to evaluate for direct quantification of dom fractions in the supernatant and permeate samples of mbrs slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra das and absorption coefficient α 254 were used to investigate possible correlations between absorbance spectroscopy and the integrity of membrane in order to provide a technical and reliable integrity monitoring method the effects of ion concentration and the log removal value lrv were further discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions as shown in fig s1 an anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor was fabricated in this laboratory scale experiment for the startup of the experiment activated sludge was taken from the second settling tank of a local wastewater treatment plant the volume of oxic tank was approximately 6 l which hrt is 8 0 h and the volume of anoxic tank was approximately 3 5 l which hrt is 4 7h the entire membrane module of pvdf hollow fiber membrane tianjin motimo membrane technology co ltd china contained 400 fibers which the effective filtration area was 0 1 m2 the inner diameter and outer diameter of fiber were 0 80 mm and 1 20 mm the membrane nominal pore size was 0 20 μm a new membrane module was used for each experiment the wastewater is pumped to the anoxic tank through the diaphragm pump and the anoxic tank flowed to the oxic tank by overflow the influent water was synthetic wastewater which contained 272 mg l glucose 272 mg l starch 145 mg l nh4 2so4 18 5 mg l kh2po4 305 mg l nahco3 23 5 mg l mgso4 7h2o 40 mg l urea 14 4 mg l cacl2 23 5

bt100 2j baoding longer precision pump co ltd china the time relay controls a suction cycle of 10 min followed by 2 min relaxation no suction the sludge returned from oxic tank to anoxic tank every 2 h for 10 min and the reflux ratio was 100 an air diffuser was installed at the bottom of the oxic tank to maintain the dissolved oxygen at 4 6 mg l and the sludge retention time srt was approximately 20d the sludge concentrations of mbr were set up 9620 485 mg l in the experiment and the sludge concentration of anoxic tank was maintained at 15837 685 mg l 2 2 absorbance data processing 2 2 1 the slope of the log transformed absorbance spectra an uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan was used for the test of absorbance in this study the log transformed absorbance spectra lnaλ and the slope of the log transformed absorbance spectra were set as two alternative parameters roccaro et al 2015 1 s λ 1 λ 2 d l n a λ d λ λ 1 λ 2 where the ln a λ refers to the logarithm of the absorbance at any wavelength where λ1 and λ2 are the wavelength ranges for calculating the slope of the spectral interval the slope280 350 is the slopes of linear correlation that fit the log transformed absorbance in the wavelengths region280 350 nm yan et al 2013 the wavelength at 220 500nm was used as the analysis scope because of the 200 220 nm ultraviolet absorption spectrum is affected by hco3 no3 plasma moreover the wavelength after 500 nm includes less information korshin et al 2009 tsoumanis et al 2010 in this study slopes were calculated for seven wavelength ranges including 230 250nm 250 285nm 275 295nm 285 305nm 280 350nm 330 370nm 325 375nm and related linear analysis was performed 2 2 2 the differential absorbance spectroscopy das the das were calculated using the equations 2 and 3 2 δ a λ a λ i a λ ref 3 δ ln a λ ln a λ i ln a λ ref where aλ i is the dom absorbance measured at the wavelength λ for any selected condition aλ ref is an applicable reference of the dom absorbance measured at the wavelength λ for the membrane is integrity lnaλ is the differential log transformed absorbance spectra yan et al 2016 2 2 3 absorption coefficient a λ analysis the absorption coefficients were calculated as defined below zhang et al 2009 4 a λ 2 303 d λ r 5 a λ a λ a 700 λ 700 where a λ is the uncorrected dom absorption coefficient at wavelength λ d λ is the absorbance at wavelength λ and r is the cuvette path length in meter a λ is the absorption coefficient at a given wavelength λ corrected for scattering and a 700 is the uncorrected absorption coefficient at 700 nm zhang et al 2011 2 2 4 deconvolution of the differential spectra deconvolution of the differential spectra was conducted to determine the presence and contributions of the distinct bands using the software peakfit version 4 12 the bands were assumed to have a gaussian shape when represented versus photon energy measured in ev calculated as yan and korshin 2014 6 e e v 1240 λ nm each gaussian band ai was characterized by the location of its maximum e0i its width wi and its amplitude a0i this generated differential spectra δ a e computed as huang et al 2018a 7 δ a e δ a i δ a 0 i e x p 1 2 e e 0 i w i 2 2 3 analytical methods determine of the mbr treatment performance and membrane integrity using a particle counter pcx 2200 hach usa with test range is from 2μm to 750μm the ph was measured by a ph detector fe20 five easy plus mettler toledo swiss the do concentration of the oxic tank was measured by a dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa the organic molecular weight distribution in the supernatant and permeate were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc nexera lc 40 shimadzu japan for the water sample pretreatment 100ml of the sludge in oxic tank was measured through a graduated cylinder and then let it settle for 60 minutes prior to analysis the supernatant in graduated cylinder was taken by disposable syringes 2 4 statistical analysis cluster analysis ca could group the cases into clusters based on their similarities within a class and dissimilarities between different classes the basic principle is to quantitatively determine the close relationship between samples according to the attributes of the samples themselves in this study cluster analysis was performed to identify dom leakage process when the membrane integrity is compromised at different filtration times the distance between the sample and the sample similarity served as the basis for cluster analysis the euclidean distance is the most commonly used measurements to find the similarity of cases and the distance from time i to time j is computed by hajigholizadeh and melesse 2017 willett 1987 8 di j k 1 p z i k z j k 2 0 5 where p is the number of variables zi k is standardized value for variable at time i zj k is standardized value for variable at time j the data used for cluster analysis were the uv vis absorption spectrum at 12 times 0 120min which had already been standardized all cluster analysis were carried out using the spss 22 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 the organic molecular weight of the supernatant and the permeate the organic molecular weight distribution in the supernatant and permeate were shown in fig 1 peak 1 represents the dom with a molecular weight of 378 1 kda peak 2 represents the dom with a molecular weight of 12 9 kda peak 3 and peak 4 represent dom with a molecular weight of less than 1kda all the peaks value of the dom in the supernatant of mbr are greater than that in the permeate the main reason is the effect retention of the membrane module from our previous study we know that wang 2020 after filtering through a 0 2 µm pore size ultrafiltration membrane the protein like species was effectively rejected the humic like and fulvic like species could be partially rejected when the membrane is integrity at least 20 25 of the dom can be absolutely rejected by the membrane what s more the membrane retention effect extended to the lower molecular weight range rather than the membrane nominal pore size because of the partly retain colloids and small molecules via mechanisms of mechanical sieving size exclusion adsorption and metal organic complexation xin et al 2020 therefore monitoring the dom retention performance of the membrane was an effective indicator of breakage membrane 3 2 the slope of the log transformed absorbance spectra analysis as shown in fig s2 it can be seen that the log transformed absorbance spectra at different number of breakage fibers and the breakage time of the membrane we breakage the number of fibers from 1 to 5 with the log transformed absorbance spectra analysis the schematic diagram of breakage fiber is shown in fig s3 as the number breakage fiber increases the absorbance value gradually increases fig s2 a in the initial stage of membrane breakage a large amount of dom would leak into the permeate which resulted the absorbance value increase after filtering for a period of time the absorbance value gradually decreases but the absorbance value is greater than that when the membrane module is integrity the reason for this phenomenon is the sludge in the oxic tank would enter the membrane fiber through the damaged location and gradually becomes tight which forms the self healing of components it is a secondary retention for the dom in the feed water after about 10 minutes we can know that the change of absorbance value gradually tends to be consistent which were presented in fig s2 b nevertheless at any given time the value of log transformed absorbance spectra for breakage membrane was larger than that of the intact membrane when the single membrane integrity is compromised it is necessary to remove the single membrane module from the system and locate the breakage pore through the direct methods such as bubble point test if there were a few breakage fibers the repair solution needed to inject into the port of the breakage fiber to block the membrane which could prevent pollutants in the feed water from passing through the breakage pore the single membrane module needs to be replaced immediately with a new membrane module if the membrane is severely damaged bennett 2005 guo et al 2010c zhang et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the wavelength from 280 to 350 nm reflects the activation of polyhydroxyaromatics pha in natural organic matter this wavelength interval is closely related to the humic like species that produce disinfection by products roccaro et al 2015 small molecular weight aromatic structures such as humic like species are rich in c c and the absorbance is concentrated in longer bands 273 350 yan et al 2012 the absorbance at 285nm has a high correlation with dom in water platikanov et al 2014 in this study the slopes of each wavelength range under different operating conditions were calculated and the slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra were linearly analyzed with the number of breakage fibers as shown in the table 3 the slopes of the log transformed absorbance spectra at 280 350 nm slope280 350 and 250 285 nm slope250 285 were calculated which have a positive correlation with the different number of breakage fibers the r2 of the slope280 350 is 0 901 and the r2 of the slope250 285 is 0 881 the slope280 350 has a better correlation than the slope250 285 with the different number of breakage fibers therefore the uv vis log transformed absorbance spectra analysis is an effective tool for the membrane integrity test where humic like species is an effective indicator 3 3 the das analysis and gaussian band fitting as shown in fig 2 the das was calculated with different number of breakage fibers and different filtration times in the mbr system we artificially breakage the number of fibers were 1 2 3 4 5 respectively and the corresponding breakage rates were 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 respectively fig 2 a with the increase of the number of breakage fibers the absorbance value of the permeate increases clearly but all the absorbance value is less than the absorbance value of the supernatant the dom enters the permeate through the breakage fiber which caused the absorbance value of the permeate increases it is interesting to note that the das also appears the self healing of components based on different filtration times fig 2 b after about 10 minutes of filtration the absorbance no longer decreased and remained basically stable therefore according to the das we found that the absorbance can be used as a good indicator for detecting the dom content in the permeate of mbrs to obtain more information about the dom in permeate samples the das were further processed by deconvolution and curve fitting analysis the peak fitting results show that seven gaussian bands were successfully model from the experimental data these gaussian bands with similar positions but different intensities for the permeate at different number of breakage fibers which were a1 226 nm a2 258 nm a3 283 nm a4 312 nm a5 339 nm a6 367 nm and a7 395 nm as shown in fig 3 it should be noted that the band a1 was weak and would be impacted by the presence of hydroxyl and other inorganic ions yan and korshin 2014 in addition the band a7 have slightly change compared with a6 in different operating conditions hence the band a1 and a7 will not be discussed in this paper we could know that the intensity of bands changed with the increase of the number of breakage fibers previous studies have shown that absorbance in the neighborhood of roughly 240 270 nm is a result of n π transition on c o groups andπ π transition on unsaturated c c structures huang et al 2018b while the das wavelength curve of phenolic group showed peaks located at a4 and a6 the carboxylic groups in dom showed behavior at a3 yan et al 2017 the relative intensity is obtained by integrating the area of the gaussian peaks with the increase of the number of breakage fiber the value of the gaussian peak a2 a6 increases as presented in fig 4 the intensity of a3 had little value change especially when the three or four fibers are breakage but it has the best correlation with the number of breakage fibers which was 0 974 the a3 was the protein like and humic like species while a2 a4 a5 a6 also have a good correlation with the number of breakage fiber and their correlation coefficients are respectively 0 895 0 946 0 908 and 0 868 therefore we believe that gaussian peaks can show the integrity of membrane at different membrane breakage rates 3 4 the absorption coefficient α 254 analysis as shown in fig 5 the α 254 was calculated under the conditions of different filtration time and different number of breakage fibers after the membrane is breakage the value of α 254 increases rapidly which reaching the highest value at about 0 5 min this value reached stable at about 40 minutes interestingly we also found a self repair phenomenon in the analysis of α 254 in fig 5 b the correlation coefficient between the α 254 value and the number of breakage fibers is 0 955 and it is far greater than that when the membrane is integrity compared with gaussian peak detection α 254 can better reflect the membrane performance at different number of breakage fibers 3 5 effect of ion concentration domestic sewage generally contains low concentrations of metal ions but high concentrations of inorganic ions such as na k ca2 so4 2 cl etc are found in industrial wastewater and high salt wastewater hu et al 2020 khatri et al 2017 on the other hand the coagulation ions will be added into the wastewater during the pretreatment process in this study we introduced calcium ions for hardness ions and iron ions for coagulation ions the feso4 fe2 and cacl2 ca2 were used to analyze the influence of ion concentration on uv spectrum detection as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6 b ion concentration mainly affects the spectral slopes the range of wavelength 250 285nm 275 295nm and 285 330nm in the above analysis the slope280 350 and slope250 285 which were associated with has a positive correlation on the different numbers of breakage fibers therefore slope250 285 can be used as an indicator without being affected by fe2 and ca2 study had shown that the combination of ca2 with dom is mainly through the action of the electrostatic layer while the ability to complex with functional groups such as unsaturated carboxyl and phenolic groups in dom is very weak and can be ignored the coagulant iron ion and dom are mainly complexed with unsaturated carboxyl and phenolic groups lu and allen 2002 when the treatment for high ion concentration wastewater such as the wastewater with high salinity slope280 350 can effectively detect the integrity of the membrane module and the treatment performance without being affected by the ion concentration as a matter of fact the difference in the value of the original ultraviolet absorption spectrum is very small and it cannot be observed by naked eyes differential spectroscopy can be used to characterize the relationship between the amount of complexing between dom and metal ions such as ca2 and fe2 this method contains a wealth of information on the characteristics of organic matter dom contains a large number of carboxyl groups phenolic hydroxyl groups amine groups and carbonyl groups which can complex or chelate heavy metals with a solubility range in water such as zn ni ba mn ca cr and so on sharpless and blough 2014 its complex mechanism mainly based on the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups attached to the aromatic hydrocarbon side chain values of the gaussian peak of das are shown in fig 6 c and fig 6 d different concentrations of ca2 and fe2 have different degrees of influence on each gaussian peak including the a4 a5 and a6 peaks that are highly correlated with the number of breakage fibers after the addition of fe2 although the organic matter content is reduced due to the effect of flocculation a gradual increase at values of gaussian peaks is observed fe2 has a higher affinity for dom and can coordinate with the carboxyl group in dom to form flocs for the analysis of ca2 there is no obvious linear relationship except peaks a4 in fact ca2 will also complex with organic functional groups yan and korshin 2014 yan et al 2013 specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm is expected to describe the hydrophobic and hydrophilic performance of dom and estimate its quality and proportion fig 6 e presents the influence of ion concentration on the α 254 compared with slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra and das α 254 is the least affected because it mainly reflects the quantity of organic matter instead of the influence of the complexing process of ca2 and fe2 with dom with the concentration of fe2 increased the values of α 254 gradually decreased from 41 95 to 31 54 possibly due to the flocculation of iron ions with the increase of ca2 concentration α 254 showed a slight upward trend it gradually stabilized at 40 85 41 25 and the initial value was 39 04 therefore affected by the complexation of organic functional groups α 254 is more suitable for industrial wastewater treatment process with relatively low organics concentration hence the three detection methods are not suitable for all water quality detection and will have different sensitivity due to different water quality 3 6 cluster analysis of uv vis absorption spectroscopy as showen in fig 7 in order to study the leakage of organic matter after the membrane is breakage cluster analysis of uv vis absorption spectrum at different filtration times was studied according to the results of the distance between groups it was found that dom leakage process could be divided into three stages bulk leakage stage development stage and stabilization stage there are a large amount dom leakage stage at 0 5 2min development stage including an initial stage of leakage 0 0 2min and second interception stage 2 40min and the stabilization stage was at 80 120min where the membrane inegrity results are similar to the stabilization stage with fewer leakage organic matter we got the highest organic content at 0 5min it is far away from the other time groups it declares that the amount of organic matter leakage is different in filtration times the analysis of α 254 slope280 350 slope250 285 gaussian peaks a4 a5 a6 at different filtration times when the membrane was breakage were shown in fig s4 the detection criteria of the uv vis spectrum for different pairs of time periods should also be different but it is certain that the detection results in all time periods are greater than that when the membrane integrity in the detection process of α 254 the change ratio r254 of the value α 254 was calculated using equations 9 9 r 254 v m v i where vm is the value of α 254 during operation process after the membrane is breakage and when the membrane is integrity the detection value is vi as shown in fig 8 a the value of r254 is 2 06 3 20 in the bulk leakage stage the value of r254 is 1 80 2 06 in the development stage in the stabilization stage the value of r254 is 1 78 1 85 during the slope of log transformed absorbance spectra detection process the change ratio rs of the value slopem n was calculated using equations 10 10 r s p m p i where pm is the value of slopem n during operation process after the membrane is breakage and when the membrane module is integrity the detection value is pi as shown in fig 8 b the value of rs slope280 350 is 5 82 10 2 in the bulk leakage stage the value of rs slope280 350 is 5 01 5 82in the development stage in the stabilization stage the value of rs slope280 350 is 5 67 5 78 the value of rs slope250 285 is 5 44 8 08 in the bulk leakage stage the value of rs slope250 285 is 5 10 5 48 in the development stage in the stabilization stage the value of rs slope280 350 is 5 00 5 05 in the calculation of the das aλ ref is an applicable reference of the dom absorbance measured at the wavelength λ for the membrane is integrity therefore the change ratio r of gaussian peaks cannot be calculated in the process of membrane module integrity test the change rate rx can be used to determine the stage of membrane module breakage 3 7 sample analysis and comparison to a particle counter particle counting method is the most commonly used detection method in the current membrane filtration process which particle test range is from 2μm to 750μm as displayed in fig 9 with the increase of the breakage number of the fiber from 1 to 5 the particle content detected by the particle counter increases linearly compared with the particle counting we found that the slope280 350 have the same growth trend for particle number which proves the reliability of the data of the testing fig 9 a once the spectral detection value or particle number exceeds the preset standards the membrane module tested can be deemed as failure in fact as shown in fig 9 c the detection result of α 254 is similar to the slope of log transformed absorbance spectra and the same detection trend as the particle counter is obtained what s more compared with the particle counting detection uv vis absorption spectrum is portable and flexible low requirements for detecting water samples and is capable of realizing decentralized detection of subunits of large mbr systems and even individual components based on the effects of ions the correlations between uv vis absorption spectrum and particle counting were corrected the uv vis absorption spectrum corrected test value um may be formulated as follows 11 u m v m i 1 n a i n v m where vm is the original uv vis absorption spectrum test value m is the number of breakage fibers ai is the uv vis absorption spectrum test value under different ion concentrations n is the number of ion concentrations the summarization of different correlation coefficients was shown in table 4 after correction the r2 of α 254 increased from 0 9438 to 0 9711 the r2 of slope decreased because of the effect of ions in the drinking water treatment the pathogen removal efficiency is measured in terms of the lrv the sensitivity of uv vis absorption spectrum test can be expressed as eq 12 and eq 13 12 lrv log m a f a breach 13 m q f v f q p v θ where a f is the uv absorption detection results in the feed water the abreach is the uv absorption detection results in the permeate the qf is the quantity of organics in the feed water the qp is the quantity of organics in the permeate the quantity of organics was calculated by cod the vf is the designed filtrate flow of the membrane and the vθ is the flow from the breaches associated with the smallest integrity test response that can be reliably measured consequently the lrv value of the α 254 is 4 06 the lrv value of the slope280 350 is 3 93 and the lrv value of the gaussian peak a4 is 4 27 all the values are superior to particle counting which with an lrv of 3 50 it is clear that the slope280 350 is more suitable for determining and providing early warning of system leakage occur the das and gaussian peaks apply to detecet the organics in feed water with phenolic group and behavior the α 254 is suited to detect the feed water with humic like macromolecular organic compounds and aromatic compounds containing c c double bonds formation 4 conclusions we proposed a techniques of uv vis absorption spectrum based on log transformed absorbance spectra das and α 254 to evaluate for the membrane integrity of mbrs as a result compared with different breakage numbers of fibers the correlation coefficient of slope280 350 is 0 901 and the r2 of the slope250 285 is 0 881 slope280 350 can effectively test the integrity of the membrane and the treatment performance without being affected by the ion concentration seven gaussian bands were successfully model from the experimental data and a4 312 nm a5 339 nm a6 367 nm were chosen to indicate the extent of breakage fiber peak 4 is minimally affected by ions the correlation coefficient between α 254 and the number of breakage fibers is 0 955 α 254 is more suitable for industrial wastewater treatment process with relatively low organics concentration according to the cluster analysis results of the distance between groups the dom leakage process was divided into three stages which were bulk leakage stage development stage and stabilization stage uv vis absorption spectrum can detect the water quality and

cleaning lipp et al 2009 mechanical breakage by particles or sharp materials wang et al 2016 fatigue damage caused by the impact of water flow and vigorous backwashing aging of the film material serious fouling status of the membrane gao et al 2019 pype et al 2016 and o ring failure or faulty installation the integrity of membrane must be effectively detected in time which is particularly important for the discharge of sewage and the safety of drinking water during the past decades large amount of studies conducted had already summarized that the membrane integrity testing methods were divided into three main groups direct methods indirect methods and surrogate challenge tests guo et al 2010a all these methods have their own advantages and disadvantages which were compared in table 1 the direct methods directly applied to the membrane itself for testing with high sensitivity which were suitable for the detection of a single module in the system direct methods include diffusive air flow test daf bubble point test bpt pressure decay test pdt acoustic sensor test liquid liquid porosimetry test and binary gas integrity test at present the pdt bpt and daf are the most widely used in engineering the bpt can also be used to determine the damaged location after the membrane integrity is compromised brehant et al 2010 phattaranawik et al 2008 shin et al 2016 the indirect methods mainly rely on the change of separation performance and effluent water quality to reflect the integrity of the membrane such as particle counting micro bubbles test particle monitoring and turbidity monitoring these methods are able to detect membrane integrity on line appropriate for any membrane system effectively and the operation is simple but the detection sensitivity is relatively low it is more suitable for the determination and early warning of the membrane module breakage suh et al 2011 troester et al 2014 the principle of the surrogate challenge tests is similar to the indirect methods mainly by introducing tracers with different characteristics into the feed water the tracer content can be used to judge the membrane separation performance with high sensitivity however the surrogate challenge tests are still limited by the choice of the medium tracer and the detection method what s more the safety performance needs to be verified the surrogate challenge tests include spiked integrity monitoring system simtm magnetic particle challenge test microbial challenge test fluorescent silica particles challenge test and the nanoscale probe challenge tests xin et al 2019 in fact spectral detection methods such as excitation emission matrix ultraviolet and visible uv vis absorbance spectrum and fourier transform infrared spectrum ft ir are extensively used in water quality test because of the advantages of high sensitivity strong selectivity no reagent application and no secondary pollution henderson et al 2009 liden et al 2016 however ft ir spectral is not suitable for the analysis of aqueous samples because of the hydroxyl peak in the water interferes with the measurement the fluorescence spectroscopy detection is prone to inner filter effect ife which need to be corrected and the sample needs to be diluted murphy et al 2010 in addition fluorescence quenching will also occur the ph and temperature of the system will affect the intensity of fluorescence the uv vis absorbance spectrum is easy to detect the changes in absorbance of water sample and it is less affected by the sample concentration therefore the uv vis absorbance spectrum is easier to realize on line monitoring xin et al 2020 noticeably it has been documented that uv vis absorbance spectrum is able to monitor natural organic matter nom effectively yamamura et al 2014 and it can be used to analysis the indication of membrane performance and measure the fouling propensity of nom zhou and meng 2015 synchronized uv vis spectroscopic can realize the qualitative analysis of foulants deposition process and membrane fouling in uf system gao et al 2018 uv vis spectral parameters for dissolved organic matter dom detection include absorbance spectral slope differential absorbance spectroscopy das and so on lavonen et al 2015 recent studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of dom chromophores to interactions with protons metal cations oxidants and the presence of prominent features in differential spectra can be resolved into gaussian bands in addition the quantization of kinetics and mechanisms of nom metal ions interactions could be studied through das and it also monitor them in practically important system gao et al 2015 slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra measured were used for the water quality monitoring change of dom and coagulation control beichen et al 2018 roccaro et al 2015 yan et al 2013 therefore uv vis absorbance spectrum plays an important role in the identification of organic matter in water treatment in this paper uv vis absorption spectrum was used to evaluate for direct quantification of dom fractions in the supernatant and permeate samples of mbrs slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra das and absorption coefficient α 254 were used to investigate possible correlations between absorbance spectroscopy and the integrity of membrane in order to provide a technical and reliable integrity monitoring method the effects of ion concentration and the log removal value lrv were further discussed 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup and operating conditions as shown in fig s1 an anoxic oxic membrane bioreactor was fabricated in this laboratory scale experiment for the startup of the experiment activated sludge was taken from the second settling tank of a local wastewater treatment plant the volume of oxic tank was approximately 6 l which hrt is 8 0 h and the volume of anoxic tank was approximately 3 5 l which hrt is 4 7h the entire membrane module of pvdf hollow fiber membrane tianjin motimo membrane technology co ltd china contained 400 fibers which the effective filtration area was 0 1 m2 the inner diameter and outer diameter of fiber were 0 80 mm and 1 20 mm the membrane nominal pore size was 0 20 μm a new membrane module was used for each experiment the wastewater is pumped to the anoxic tank through the diaphragm pump and the anoxic tank flowed to the oxic tank by overflow the influent water was synthetic wastewater which contained 272 mg l glucose 272 mg l starch 145 mg l nh4 2so4 18 5 mg l kh2po4 305 mg l nahco3 23 5 mg l mgso4 7h2o 40 mg l urea 14 4 mg l cacl2 23 5

h for 10 min and the reflux ratio was 100 an air diffuser was installed at the bottom of the oxic tank to maintain the dissolved oxygen at 4 6 mg l and the sludge retention time srt was approximately 20d the sludge concentrations of mbr were set up 9620 485 mg l in the experiment and the sludge concentration of anoxic tank was maintained at 15837 685 mg l 2 2 absorbance data processing 2 2 1 the slope of the log transformed absorbance spectra an uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu japan was used for the test of absorbance in this study the log transformed absorbance spectra lnaλ and the slope of the log transformed absorbance spectra were set as two alternative parameters roccaro et al 2015 1 s λ 1 λ 2 d l n a λ d λ λ 1 λ 2 where the ln a λ refers to the logarithm of the absorbance at any wavelength where λ1 and λ2 are the wavelength ranges for calculating the slope of the spectral interval the slope280 350 is the slopes of linear correlation that fit the log transformed absorbance in the wavelengths region280 350 nm yan et al 2013 the wavelength at 220 500nm was used as the analysis scope because of the 200 220 nm ultraviolet absorption spectrum is affected by hco3 no3 plasma moreover the wavelength after 500 nm includes less information korshin et al 2009 tsoumanis et al 2010 in this study slopes were calculated for seven wavelength ranges including 230 250nm 250 285nm 275 295nm 285 305nm 280 350nm 330 370nm 325 375nm and related linear analysis was performed 2 2 2 the differential absorbance spectroscopy das the das were calculated using the equations 2 and 3 2 δ a λ a λ i a λ ref 3 δ ln a λ ln a λ i ln a λ ref where aλ i is the dom absorbance measured at the wavelength λ for any selected condition aλ ref is an applicable reference of the dom absorbance measured at the wavelength λ for the membrane is integrity lnaλ is the differential log transformed absorbance spectra yan et al 2016 2 2 3 absorption coefficient a λ analysis the absorption coefficients were calculated as defined below zhang et al 2009 4 a λ 2 303 d λ r 5 a λ a λ a 700 λ 700 where a λ is the uncorrected dom absorption coefficient at wavelength λ d λ is the absorbance at wavelength λ and r is the cuvette path length in meter a λ is the absorption coefficient at a given wavelength λ corrected for scattering and a 700 is the uncorrected absorption coefficient at 700 nm zhang et al 2011 2 2 4 deconvolution of the differential spectra deconvolution of the differential spectra was conducted to determine the presence and contributions of the distinct bands using the software peakfit version 4 12 the bands were assumed to have a gaussian shape when represented versus photon energy measured in ev calculated as yan and korshin 2014 6 e e v 1240 λ nm each gaussian band ai was characterized by the location of its maximum e0i its width wi and its amplitude a0i this generated differential spectra δ a e computed as huang et al 2018a 7 δ a e

750μm the ph was measured by a ph detector fe20 five easy plus mettler toledo swiss the do concentration of the oxic tank was measured by a dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa the organic molecular weight distribution in the supernatant and permeate were measured by high performance liquid chromatography hplc nexera lc 40 shimadzu japan for the water sample pretreatment 100ml of the sludge in oxic tank was measured through a graduated cylinder and then let it settle for 60 minutes prior to analysis the supernatant in graduated cylinder was taken by disposable syringes 2 4 statistical analysis cluster analysis ca could group the cases into clusters based on their similarities within a class and dissimilarities between different classes the basic principle is to quantitatively determine the close relationship between samples according to the attributes of the samples themselves in this study cluster analysis was performed to identify dom leakage process when the membrane integrity is compromised at different filtration times the distance between the sample and the sample similarity served as the basis for cluster analysis the euclidean distance is the most commonly used measurements to find the similarity of cases and the distance from time i to time j is computed by hajigholizadeh and melesse 2017 willett 1987 8 di j k 1 p z i k z j k 2 0 5 where p is the number of variables zi k is standardized value for variable at time i zj k is standardized value for variable at time j the data used for cluster analysis were the uv vis absorption spectrum at 12 times 0 120min which had already been standardized all cluster analysis were carried out using the spss 22 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 the organic molecular weight of the supernatant and the permeate the organic molecular weight distribution in the supernatant and permeate were shown in fig 1 peak 1 represents the dom with a molecular weight of 378 1 kda peak 2 represents the dom with a molecular weight of 12 9 kda peak 3 and peak 4 represent dom with a molecular weight of less than 1kda all the peaks value of the dom in the supernatant of mbr are greater than that in the permeate the main reason is the effect retention of the membrane module from our previous study we know that wang 2020 after filtering through a 0 2 µm pore size ultrafiltration membrane the protein like species was effectively rejected the humic like and fulvic like species could be partially rejected when the membrane is integrity at least 20 25 of the dom can be absolutely rejected by the membrane what s more the membrane retention effect extended to the lower molecular weight range rather than the membrane nominal pore size because of the partly retain colloids and small molecules via mechanisms of mechanical sieving size exclusion adsorption and metal organic complexation xin et al 2020 therefore monitoring the dom retention performance of the membrane was an effective indicator of breakage membrane 3 2 the slope of the log transformed absorbance spectra analysis as shown in fig s2 it can be seen that the log transformed absorbance spectra at different number of breakage fibers and the breakage time of the membrane we breakage the number of fibers from 1 to 5 with the log transformed absorbance spectra analysis the schematic diagram of breakage fiber is shown in fig s3 as the number breakage fiber increases the absorbance value gradually increases fig s2 a in the initial stage of membrane breakage a large amount of dom would leak into the permeate which resulted the absorbance value increase after filtering for a period of time the absorbance value gradually decreases but the absorbance value is greater than that when the membrane module is integrity the reason for this phenomenon is the sludge in the oxic tank would enter the membrane fiber through the damaged location and gradually becomes tight which forms the self healing of components it is a secondary retention for the dom in the feed water after about 10 minutes we can know that the change of absorbance value gradually tends to be consistent which were presented in fig s2 b nevertheless at any given time the value of log transformed absorbance spectra for breakage membrane was larger than that of the intact membrane when the single membrane integrity is compromised it is necessary to remove the single membrane module from the system and locate the breakage pore through the direct methods such as bubble point test if there were a few breakage fibers the repair solution needed to inject into the port of the breakage fiber to block the membrane which could prevent pollutants in the feed water from passing through the breakage pore the single membrane module needs to be replaced immediately with a new membrane module if the membrane is severely damaged bennett 2005 guo et al 2010c zhang et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the wavelength from 280 to 350 nm reflects the activation of polyhydroxyaromatics pha in natural organic matter this wavelength interval is closely related to the humic like species that produce disinfection by products roccaro et al 2015 small molecular weight aromatic structures such as humic like species are rich in c c and the absorbance is concentrated in longer bands 273 350 yan et al 2012 the absorbance at 285nm has a high correlation with dom in water platikanov et al 2014 in this study the slopes of each wavelength range under different operating conditions were calculated and the slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra were linearly analyzed with the number of breakage fibers as shown in the table 3 the slopes of the log transformed absorbance spectra at 280 350 nm slope280 350 and 250 285 nm slope250 285 were calculated which have a positive correlation with the different number of breakage fibers the r2 of the slope280 350 is 0 901 and the r2 of the slope250 285 is 0 881 the slope280 350 has a better correlation than the slope250 285 with the different number of breakage fibers therefore the uv vis log transformed absorbance spectra analysis is an effective tool for the membrane integrity test where humic like species is an effective indicator 3 3 the das analysis and gaussian band fitting as shown in fig 2 the das was calculated with different number of breakage fibers and different filtration times in the mbr system we artificially breakage the number of fibers were 1 2 3 4 5 respectively and the corresponding breakage rates were 0 25 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 respectively fig 2 a with the increase of the number of breakage fibers the absorbance value of the permeate increases clearly but all the absorbance value is less than the absorbance value of the supernatant the dom enters the permeate through the breakage fiber which caused the absorbance value of the permeate increases it is interesting to note that the das also appears the self healing of components based on different filtration times fig 2 b after about 10 minutes of filtration the absorbance no longer decreased and remained basically stable therefore according to the das we found that the absorbance can be used as a good indicator for detecting the dom content in the permeate of mbrs to obtain more information about the dom in permeate samples the das were further processed by deconvolution and curve fitting analysis the peak fitting results show that seven gaussian bands were successfully model from the experimental data these gaussian bands with similar positions but different intensities for the permeate at different number of breakage fibers which were a1 226 nm a2 258 nm a3 283 nm a4 312 nm a5 339 nm a6 367 nm and a7 395 nm as shown in fig 3 it should be noted that the band a1 was weak and would be impacted by the presence of hydroxyl and other inorganic ions yan and korshin 2014 in addition the band a7 have slightly change compared with a6 in different operating conditions hence the band a1 and a7 will not be discussed in this paper we could know that the intensity of bands changed with the increase of the number of breakage fibers previous studies have shown that absorbance in the neighborhood of roughly 240 270 nm is a result of n π transition on c o groups andπ π transition on unsaturated c c structures huang et al 2018b while the das wavelength curve of phenolic group showed peaks located at a4 and a6 the carboxylic groups in dom showed behavior at a3 yan et al 2017 the relative intensity is obtained by integrating the area of the gaussian peaks with the increase of the number of breakage fiber the value of the gaussian peak a2 a6 increases as presented in fig 4 the intensity of a3 had little value change especially when the three or four fibers are breakage but it has the best correlation with the number of breakage fibers which was 0 974 the a3 was the protein like and humic like species while a2 a4 a5 a6 also have a good correlation with the number of breakage fiber and their correlation coefficients are respectively 0 895 0 946 0 908 and 0 868 therefore we believe that gaussian peaks can show the integrity of membrane at different membrane breakage rates 3 4 the absorption coefficient α 254 analysis as shown in fig 5 the α 254 was calculated under the conditions of different filtration time and different number of breakage fibers after the membrane is breakage the value of α 254 increases rapidly which reaching the highest value at about 0 5 min this value reached stable at about 40 minutes interestingly we also found a self repair phenomenon in the analysis of α 254 in fig 5 b the correlation coefficient between the α 254 value and the number of breakage fibers is 0 955 and it is far greater than that when the membrane is integrity compared with gaussian peak detection α 254 can better reflect the membrane performance at different number of breakage fibers 3 5 effect of ion concentration domestic sewage generally contains low concentrations of metal ions but high concentrations of inorganic ions such as na k ca2 so4 2 cl etc are found in industrial wastewater and high salt wastewater hu et al 2020 khatri et al 2017 on the other hand the coagulation ions will be added into the wastewater during the pretreatment process in this study we introduced calcium ions for hardness ions and iron ions for coagulation ions the feso4 fe2 and cacl2 ca2 were used to analyze the influence of ion concentration on uv spectrum detection as shown in fig 6 a and fig 6 b ion concentration mainly affects the spectral slopes the range of wavelength 250 285nm 275 295nm and 285 330nm in the above analysis the slope280 350 and slope250 285 which were associated with has a positive correlation on the different numbers of breakage fibers therefore slope250 285 can be used as an indicator without being affected by fe2 and ca2 study had shown that the combination of ca2 with dom is mainly through the action of the electrostatic layer while the ability to complex with functional groups such as unsaturated carboxyl and phenolic groups in dom is very weak and can be ignored the coagulant iron ion and dom are mainly complexed with unsaturated carboxyl and phenolic groups lu and allen 2002 when the treatment for high ion concentration wastewater such as the wastewater with high salinity slope280 350 can effectively detect the integrity of the membrane module and the treatment performance without being affected by the ion concentration as a matter of fact the difference in the value of the original ultraviolet absorption spectrum is very small and it cannot be observed by naked eyes differential spectroscopy can be used to characterize the relationship between the amount of complexing between dom and metal ions such as ca2 and fe2 this method contains a wealth of information on the characteristics of organic matter dom contains a large number of carboxyl groups phenolic hydroxyl groups amine groups and carbonyl groups which can complex or chelate heavy metals with a solubility range in water such as zn ni ba mn ca cr and so on sharpless and blough 2014 its complex mechanism mainly based on the carboxyl and hydroxyl groups attached to the aromatic hydrocarbon side chain values of the gaussian peak of das are shown in fig 6 c and fig 6 d different concentrations of ca2 and fe2 have different degrees of influence on each gaussian peak including the a4 a5 and a6 peaks that are highly correlated with the number of breakage fibers after the addition of fe2 although the organic matter content is reduced due to the effect of flocculation a gradual increase at values of gaussian peaks is observed fe2 has a higher affinity for dom and can coordinate with the carboxyl group in dom to form flocs for the analysis of ca2 there is no obvious linear relationship except peaks a4 in fact ca2 will also complex with organic functional groups yan and korshin 2014 yan et al 2013 specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm is expected to describe the hydrophobic and hydrophilic performance of dom and estimate its quality and proportion fig 6 e presents the influence of ion concentration on the α 254 compared with slopes of log transformed absorbance spectra and das α 254 is the least affected because it mainly reflects the quantity of organic matter instead of the influence of the complexing process of ca2 and fe2 with dom with the concentration of fe2 increased the values of α 254 gradually decreased from 41 95 to 31 54 possibly due to the flocculation of iron ions with the increase of ca2 concentration α 254 showed a slight upward trend it gradually stabilized at 40 85 41 25 and the initial value was 39 04 therefore affected by the complexation of organic functional groups α 254 is more suitable for industrial wastewater treatment process with relatively low organics concentration hence the three detection methods are not suitable for all water quality detection and will have different sensitivity due to different water quality 3 6 cluster analysis of uv vis absorption spectroscopy as showen in fig 7 in order to study the leakage of organic matter after the membrane is breakage cluster analysis of uv vis absorption spectrum at different filtration times was studied according to the results of the distance between groups it was found that dom leakage process could be divided into three stages bulk leakage stage development stage and stabilization stage there are a large amount dom leakage stage at 0 5 2min development stage including an initial stage of leakage 0 0 2min and second interception stage 2 40min and the stabilization stage was at 80 120min where the membrane inegrity results are similar to the stabilization stage with fewer leakage organic matter we got the highest organic content at 0 5min it is far away from the other time groups it declares that the amount of organic matter leakage is different in filtration times the analysis of α 254 slope280 350 slope250 285 gaussian peaks a4 a5 a6 at different filtration times when the membrane was breakage were shown in fig s4 the detection criteria of the uv vis spectrum for different pairs of time periods should also be different but it is certain that the detection results in all time periods are greater than that when the membrane integrity in the detection process of α 254 the change ratio r254 of the value α 254 was calculated using equations 9 9 r 254 v m v i where vm is the value of α 254 during operation process after the membrane is breakage and when the membrane is integrity the detection value is vi as shown in fig 8 a the value of r254 is 2 06 3 20 in the bulk leakage stage the value of r254 is 1 80 2 06 in the development stage in the stabilization stage the value of r254 is 1 78 1 85 during the slope of log transformed absorbance spectra detection process the change ratio rs of the value slopem n was calculated using equations 10 10 r s p m p i where pm is the value of slopem n during operation process after the membrane is breakage and when the membrane module is integrity the detection value is pi as shown in fig 8 b the value of rs slope280 350 is 5 82 10 2 in the bulk leakage stage the value of rs slope280 350 is 5 01 5 82in the development stage in the stabilization stage the value of rs slope280 350 is 5 67 5 78 the value of rs slope250 285 is 5 44 8 08 in the bulk leakage stage the value of rs slope250 285 is 5 10 5 48 in the development stage in the stabilization stage the value of rs slope280 350 is 5 00 5 05 in the calculation of the das aλ ref is an applicable reference of the dom absorbance measured at the wavelength λ for the membrane is integrity therefore the change ratio r of gaussian peaks cannot be calculated in the process of membrane module integrity test the change rate rx can be used to determine the stage of membrane module breakage 3 7 sample analysis and comparison to a particle counter particle counting method is the most commonly used detection method in the current membrane filtration process which particle test range is from 2μm to 750μm as displayed in fig 9 with the increase of the breakage number of the fiber from 1 to 5 the particle content detected by the particle counter increases linearly compared with the particle counting we found that the slope280 350 have the same growth trend for particle number which proves the reliability of the data of the testing fig 9 a once the spectral detection value or particle number exceeds the preset standards the membrane module tested can be deemed as failure in fact as shown in fig 9 c the detection result of α 254 is similar to the slope of log transformed absorbance spectra and the same detection trend as the particle counter is obtained what s more compared with the particle counting detection uv vis absorption spectrum is portable and flexible low requirements for detecting water samples and is capable of realizing decentralized detection of subunits of large mbr systems and even individual components based on the effects of ions the correlations between uv vis absorption spectrum and particle counting were corrected the uv vis absorption spectrum corrected test value um may be formulated as follows 11 u m v m i 1 n a i n v m where vm is the original uv vis absorption spectrum test value m is the number of breakage fibers ai is the uv vis absorption spectrum test value under different ion concentrations n is the number of ion concentrations the summarization of different correlation coefficients was shown in table 4 after correction the r2 of α 254 increased from 0 9438 to 0 9711 the r2 of slope decreased because of the effect of ions in the drinking water treatment the pathogen removal efficiency is measured in terms of the lrv the sensitivity of uv vis absorption spectrum test can be expressed as eq 12 and eq 13 12 lrv log m a f a breach 13 m q f v f q p v θ where a f is the uv absorption detection results in the feed water the abreach is the uv absorption detection results in the permeate the qf is the quantity of organics in the feed water the qp is the quantity of organics in the permeate the quantity of organics was calculated by cod the vf is the designed filtrate flow of the membrane and the vθ is the flow from the breaches associated with the smallest integrity test response that can be reliably measured consequently the lrv value of the α 254 is 4 06 the lrv value of the slope280 350 is 3 93 and the lrv value of the gaussian peak a4 is 4 27 all the values are superior to particle counting which with an lrv of 3 50 it is clear that the slope280 350 is more suitable for determining and providing early warning of system leakage occur the das and gaussian peaks apply to detecet the organics in feed water with phenolic group and behavior the α 254 is suited to detect the feed water with humic like macromolecular organic compounds and aromatic compounds containing c c double bonds formation 4 conclusions we proposed a techniques of uv vis absorption spectrum based on log transformed absorbance spectra das and α 254 to evaluate for the membrane integrity of mbrs as a result compared with different breakage numbers of fibers the correlation coefficient of slope280 350 is 0 901 and the r2 of the slope250 285 is 0 881 slope280 350 can effectively test the integrity of the membrane and the treatment performance without being affected by the ion concentration seven gaussian bands were successfully model from the experimental data and a4 312 nm a5 339 nm a6 367 nm were chosen to indicate the extent of breakage fiber peak 4 is minimally affected by ions the correlation coefficient between α 254 and the number of breakage fibers is 0 955 α 254 is more suitable for industrial wastewater treatment process with relatively low organics concentration according to the cluster analysis results of the distance between groups the dom leakage process was divided into three stages which were bulk leakage stage development stage and stabilization stage uv vis absorption spectrum can detect the water quality and

17006,forward osmosis membrane distillation fo md hybrids were recently found suitable for produced water treatment exclusion of synthetic chemical draw solutions typically used for fo can reduce fo md operational costs and ease its onsite application this study experimentally validates a novel concept for the simultaneous treatment of different produced water streams available at the same industrial site using an fo md hybrid system the water oil separator outlet wo stream was selected as fo draw solution and it generated average fluxes ranging between 8 30 lmh and 26 78 lmh with four different feed streams fo fluxes were found to be governed by the complex composition of the feed streams on the other hand with wo stream as md feed an average flux of 14 41 lmh was achieved calcium ions were found as a main reason for md flux decline in the form of caso4 scaling and stimulating the interaction between the membrane and humic acid molecules to form scale layer causing reduction in heat transfer and decline in md flux 6 emulsified oil solution was responsible for partial pore clogging resulting in further 2 flux decline ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid edta was able to mask a portion of calcium ions and resulted in a complete recovery of the original md flux under hybrid fo md experiments md fluxes between 5 62 lmh and 11 12 lmh were achieved therefore the novel concept is validated to produce fairly stable fo and md fluxes with few streams without severe fouling and producing excellent product water quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords produced

injection this water returns back to the surface loaded with hydrocarbons salts and other contaminants commonly known as produced water xu et al 2018 this water represents one of the largest streams of process wastewater generated in the industry dickhout et al 2017 produced water contains a mixture of dissolved and particulate organic and inorganic chemicals and its characteristics change with time the quantity produced varies greatly depending on the location and age of the petroleum reservoir generally it is about 7 8 times larger in volume than the oil extracted al furaiji et al 2019 however due to ageing of wells the oil production reduces therefore it is estimated that the volume ratio between produced water to oil production may globally ramp up to 12 by 2025 jiménez et al 2018 which will increase the need for efficient produced water treatment strategies crude oil is extracted as a mixture of gas oil and water and is separated in a three phase separator vessel the principle of three phase separator is based on gravity which allows water to settle at the bottom of the separator then discharged as a wastewater stream referred as 3ps in this study soliman et al 2020 the salt content of crude oil consists of different salts dissolved in small oil droplets refineries desalt crude oil using fresh water or sometimes a mixture of fresh and treated water jointly termed as wash water ww the desalting of oil with ww results in the generation of the desalter effluent de this de is a stable emulsion of oil in water which must be treated before disposal ahmed et al 2020 after a suitable treatment produced water can meet stringent environmental standards and reduce the load over fresh water resources elmaleh and ghaffour 1996 wenzlick and siefert 2020 it can serve as a valuable water resource for various applications including reinjection into the wells before reinjection the produced water is passed through a water oil separator commonly called wosep a good quality of wosep outlet wo treated water will eventually improve the receiving ground water quality a schematic diagram illustrating various produced water streams is shown in fig s1 in the supporting information it can be seen that other waste streams de ww 3ps ro reject contribute to the wo stream volume hence its volume can be controlled reduced by the treatment and reuse of these streams the selection of unit operations for the treatment of produced water remains challenging due to its complex composition and the high quality requirements of the treated water chang et al 2019 microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf of produced water using ceramic or polymeric membranes requires extensive pre treatment and in some cases also post treatment to improve the treated effluent quality electrodialysis ed can remove ionic salts from the produced water but it cannot remove organics and requires periodic disposal of concentrate al ghouti et al 2019 on the other hand reverse osmosis ro is not a viable solution for the treatment of produced water as ro membranes cannot directly withstand high temperatures associated with produced water which requires extensive cooling before entering the treatment system al ghouti et al 2019 concentration of total dissolved solids tds in produced water may reach 400 000 mg l which is far beyond the typical salinity limit of ro 70 000 mg l jiménez et al 2018 other distillation techniques like multi effect distillation med and multistage flash msf can be used for the treatment of highly saline solutions but remain energy intensive and costly processes ghaffour et al 2019 biological treatment of produced water is only feasible when oil and grease concentration is less than 60 mg l and chlorides are less than 6600 mg l su et al 2007 however chlorides concentration in different types of produced water streams may go up to 250 000 mg l jiménez et al 2018 other traditional techniques like hydrocylcone gravity separation and media filters cannot meet treated water quality that is suitable for recycling and reuse so sophisticated treatment technologies must be adopted bagheri et al 2018 membrane distillation md is considered as a potential technology for produced water treatment the driving force in md is the vapor pressure difference between the two sides of the membrane pore generally triggered by temperature difference between two bulk solutions kim et al 2019a md combines the advantages of conventional distillation with membrane filtration the water that evaporates at the hot feed side having higher vapor pressure condenses at the cold permeate side of the membrane having lower vapor pressure md produces water with nearly distilled quality even with nearly saturated saline streams al furaiji et al 2019 md is compact and supposed to be less susceptible to fouling than pressure driven membrane processes politano et al 2017 there are several studies available in the literature on the use of md for produced water treatment the flux in air gap membrane distillation agmd was found directly proportional to the feed temperature and energy consumption was found independent of the membrane pore size alkhudhiri et al 2013 as such a direct contact md dcmd exhibited 99 inorganics and 90 total carbon removal from produced water macedonio et al 2014 dcmd flux while treating produced water was found inversely proportional to the module length due to the reduction of driving force along the module channel xu et al 2018 the capability of md to utilize the available low grade heat which is generally available in produced water contributes in reducing the overall energy consumption tong and elimelech 2016 among different configurations of md the dcmd is most commonly used mainly for its simplicity soukane et al 2021 but other configurations such as agmd possess a higher thermal efficiency alsaadi et al 2015 another emerging membrane technology used in desalination of hypersaline solutions is forward osmosis fo the fo process utilizes natural osmotic pressure difference across the membrane as the driving force for water transport the use of a solution of higher salinity high osmotic pressure termed as draw solution ds enables freshwater recovery from targeted feed solution fs of relatively lower salinity thus lower osmotic pressure nawaz et al 2016 the fo process rejects complex organic and inorganic contaminants present in fs kim et al 2019b it utilizes energy mainly for recirculation of ds and fs and does not require any hydraulic pressure however once ds is diluted with extracted water its re concentration regeneration is critical to sustain the driving force and ensure the continuous operation of the fo system kim et al 2017 hybrid technologies are a combination of more than one technology to enhance benefits in terms of improved water quality lower operational energy and equipment footprint although ro md might be seen as a potential hybrid for the treatment of high concentration streams it presents potential drawbacks within the scope of produced water treatment indeed ro cannot be fed with wo due to its high temperature and cannot be placed in series with md due to possible salinity increase in md output to values as high as 130 g l moreover ro anti scalants may have negative impacts on md flux liu et al 2021 yan et al 2017 recent investigations found fo md hybrid system promising for various applications arcanjo et al 2020 lee et al 2018 li et al 2020 volpin et al 2019 in a fo md system the drawbacks of both processes can be reduced by regenerating ds of fo by the md process and hindering evaporative contaminants surfactants and trace organics by the fo process ghaffour et al 2019 xie et al 2013 the studies available in literature on produced water treatment using fo and md systems utilize synthetic ds al furaiji et al 2019 these ds are prepared by addition of at least one chemical to fresh water to serve simultaneously as ds for fo and fs for md chekli et al 2017 this requires on site availability of fresh water and salts which brings in additional control requirements equipment and associated operation costs therefore there is a particular need to investigate a more sustainable way that involves no use of fresh water and salts as ds to operate fo md for on site treatment of produced water in this study we present a novel concept of simultaneous utilization of different produced water streams generated at the same site depending on the stream characteristics the produced water could be used as fo fs or ds the stream with highest tds and lower oil and grease concentrations could be used as a ds while the relatively diluted streams can be used as fs to recover valuable water increase their concentration and reduce their volume thus making them suitable for evaporation or other zero liquid discharge zld process the diluted ds will then pass through dcmd for regeneration and produce high quality permeate water in such a configuration fs streams will pass through a double barrier of very selective fo and md membranes leaving behind most of the contaminants however it is also expected that due to the presence of various contaminants in the ds stream the flux through fo and md would experience more decline compared to single salt ds like nacl only this study starts with a feasibility assessment of the hybrid concept in treating different produced water streams simultaneously with emphasis on fluxes stability for both fo and dcmd processes a systematic investigation will follow to identify the dominant mechanism of fo and md membranes fouling and scaling due to the presence of complex contaminants in the feed and draw streams the concept is also verified with new integrated fo md module which includes a thermal and osmotic dual function isolation barrier son et al 2021 in order to have a better understanding of fouling mechanisms stable synthetic produced water mimicking the main composition of real produced water collected from a local industrial site is used this study will serve as a baseline to identify and eliminate any critical factors that can cause flux or permeate quality decline 2 materials and methods 2 1 formulation of synthetic produced water streams five streams were identified from local industrial sites and their samples were collected the names of streams abbreviations used in the manuscript tds concentrations and osmotic pressures are presented in table 1 detailed characterization of all five streams reported in table s1 in the supporting information was performed using advanced analytical techniques and standard methods apha 2006 based on their tds concentrations four streams were selected as potential fs and one wo as potential ds for fo based on the detailed characterization results the composition of synthetic produced water was established see first part of table 2 all elements present in real streams were added in similar molar concentrations glucose was added to represent chemical oxygen demand cod concentration and colloidal silica to represent mainly the turbidity and total suspended solids tss concentration the standalone fo experiments were carried out using the composition in table 2 without adding oil and grease to estimate the effect of other parameters on the flux however in integrated fo md experiments exact oil and grease concentrations were used for all 5 streams part two of table 2 lists the three chemicals which were used only for the systematic investigation of md membrane fouling in standalone md experiments maximum oil and grease concentration in any stream was found to be 32 mg l table s1 that is why a range of 30 50 mg l was studied to mimic a worst case scenario the oil used was a standard emulsion of oil in water with tiny droplets to mimic the most challenging type of oil presence humic acid ha is used as model foulant for natural organic matter a ha concentration range of 20 80 mg l was selected following similar investigations khan et al 2019 lee et al 2020 similarly edta is considered as a masking agent for the bivalent metals hence it was also used in the concentration range 0 001 m to 0 0005 m as described elsewhere kim et al 2020 however in the integrated fo md experiments ha and edta were not added the synthetic streams were always freshly prepared prior to each experiment all chemicals were of reagent grade and were received from sigma aldrich fisher scientific or alfa aesar and used without any additional processing 2 2 fo and md membranes for the fo experiments thin film composite polyamide tfc pa hydrophilic fo membranes were used the membranes were purchased from toray chemicals korea the thicknesses of the active and support layers are 0 86 0 1 and 99 14 1 3 μm respectively the support layer porosity is 63 5 water permeability of the fo membrane afo is 2 472e 7 m s bar solute permeability bfo is 5 444e 8 m s and structure parameter sfo is 3 28e 4 m additional details on this membrane can be found elsewhere lee and ghaffour 2019 in md experiments polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hydrophobic microporous membranes purchased from membrane solutions china were used the measured nominal pore size and porosity are 0 22 0 06 μm and 39 59 4 7 respectively thicknesses of the active layer ptfe and the support layer pp are 20 0 4 and 80 1 6 μm respectively and the liquid entry pressure lep is 3 74 bar the membranes size was 6 cm 1 6 cm for both fo and md modules which gives an active area of 0 00096 m2 2 3 experimental setups and procedures for standalone fo and md experiments two laboratory scale setups were installed for fo and md equipment source and models were generally the same for both setups schematic diagrams of standalone fo and md batch setups are shown in fig s2a and s2b respectively the fo setup consists of two variable speed gear pumps 75211 70 cole parmer usa a standard membrane cell a weighing balance me3002e mettler toledo usa and a temperature controller with water bath and heat exchangers ad07r 20 a13d polyscience usa the membrane cell has two symmetric channels i e 60 mm long 16 mm wide and 3 mm deep on both sides of the membrane one channel was fed with the feed stream and the other was fed with a draw stream variable speed gear pumps were used to provide crossflows under counter current directions the flowrate was set to 250 ml min which gives a fluid average crossflow velocity of 8 7 cm s initial fs temperature was at laboratory temperature 22 2 c while the ds temperature was maintained at 40 c throughout the experiment the latter was found to be the optimum temperature for ds and it is achievable in large scale md feed outlet temperature lee and ghaffour 2019 volpin et al 2019 both solutions were recirculated in a closed loop system resulting in a batch mode process operation the ds tank was placed on a digital weighing balance and the weight changes were recorded the fo experiments were carried out for 20 h with an initial volume of 1 l for both ds and fs a new membrane coupon was used for each experiment after which it was air dried and stored for imaging and characterization purposes the conductivities of both feed and ds were recorded in all fo experiments an active layer facing the ds al ds mode was used because the draw stream had very high tds compared to the feed streams the lab scale dcmd set up fig s2b is composed of two variable speed micro gear pumps a standard membrane cell a digital weighing balance and two temperature controllers the membrane cell has two symmetric channels i e 60 mm long 16 mm wide and 3 mm deep on both sides of the membrane one was fed with md feed and the other was fed with md permeate di water initial volumes of both md permeate and feed were set to 1 l each in all md experiments the active layer was facing md fs different fs temperatures were used while the permeate temperature was maintained at 20 c both feed and permeate temperatures were measured at the inlet of the module using sensors md experiments were continued until negligible flux below 2 lmh was observed a new membrane coupon from the same original sheet was used for each experiment after which it was air dried cut into two parts one was rinsed with di water for two minutes and the other left without rinsing and stored for imaging and characterization the conductivity of permeate solution was measured with a conductivity meter tetracon 325 with lf 298 wtw usa to monitor any salt leakage through md membrane additionally the ph of both feed and permeate solutions were measured at the beginning and after completion of the experiment the cod of permeate was also measured using hg free hach vials 3 150 mg l range to assess any leakage of volatile organics through the membrane for membrane surface characterization the stored dried membranes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem gemini ii carl zeiss smt ag germany and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx at an accelerating voltage of 3 kv and 20 kv respectively 2 4 experimental setups and procedures for integrated fo md experiments an in house designed integrated fo md module with an osmotic and thermal isolation barrier as depicted in fig 1 is used in this study kim et al 2019a the integrated module has four symmetric channels 100 mm long 20 mm wide and 3 mm deep the top channel was fed with fo fs and the bottom channel with md permeate the middle channels were fed with md fs which also serves as fo ds similar to the batch experiments md fs temperature was maintained at 60 c while md permeate was set at 20 c regarding fo the fs was initially at laboratory temperature 22 2 c similar to standalone experiments the al ds configuration was used for fo membrane and al fs md fs configuration for the md membrane countercurrent cross flow velocities were maintained at an average of 8 7 cm s with a 315 ml min flow rate the operating principle of the integrated fo md module with the barrier consists of flowing first the ds at 60 c into the channel as md fs at one side of the barrier to fully utilize its heat and maximize the md flux the same relatively concentrated ds after losing some heat and vapors to md permeate flows to the other side of the isolation barrier where it serves as fo ds fig s3 starting volume of both fo fs and fo ds was 1 l while md permeate was 0 5 l experiments were continued until either fo or md flux reached a constant minimum value below 2 lmh composition of wo and other streams was kept exactly as reported in part 1 of table 2 2 5 calculation of salt transfer across the fo membrane the salt transfer across the membrane was estimated by continuously monitoring the actual conductivity values of the fs and ds calculated values of conductivities were estimated with the assumption of zero salt transfer across the membrane and represent the actual initial conductivity divided by the cumulative volume of fs or ds at the end of the experiment these calculated values were subtracted from the actual conductivities to estimate the amount of salt transferred however regarding the fs any increase in the conductivity was either due to rsf or increase in the bulk fs temperature the increase due to temperature was calculated using eq 1 and the remainder was attributed to rsf the specific rsf srsf was obtained by dividing the rsf by the flux it is important to mention here that due to the assumptions made above the srsf values cannot be 100 correct and some margins of error must be kept into account 1 ec 1 a t 25 e c 25 with a 0 020 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux stability and membrane fouling scaling in standalone fo in order to carry out a complete experimental validation of the concept all four streams de ww 3ps ro reject were separately used as fo fs with wo as ds since all the experiments were executed under the same initial operating conditions as described in section 2 3 the difference in flux could be attributed to the composition of the different feed streams as shown in fig 2 a sharp decline of water flux was observed between the 1st h and 6th h of operation for de 3ps and ww followed by gradual flux stabilization achieved after 10th h this initial sharp decline was mainly due to the dilution of ds and loss of osmotic potential however for ro reject feed the flux showed a continuous decline almost linearly during the whole experiment with an overall highest flux compared to the other streams this could be attributed to the absence of silica colloids and low concentration of sodium chloride in the ro reject see table 2 silica colloids are found to make polymerized silica layer after interacting with tfc pa membrane on which it attaches firmly due to the si o bond kim et al 2020 however comparing the compositions of 3ps and ro reject silica is absent in both solutions and the tds concentration of 3ps is lower than ro reject 4 85 vs 6 02 g l but still the average flux of ro reject is higher 26 78 lmh compared to 3ps 14 75 lmh the main difference in their compositions is the high nacl concentration in 3ps 1045 mg l compared to ro reject 213 mg l in al ds configuration a polarized layer is established inside the porous support layer of fo membrane due to the diffusion of smallest radius monovalent salts like nacl leading to internal concentration polarization icp which reduces the overall flux lee et al 2020 thus icp caused by monovalent salts is probably the first main reason for the fo flux decline furthermore ro reject is expected to have less fouling compared to other streams because of its advanced pre treatment prior to the ro process which may explain the absence of the sharp decline of the initial fo flux looking at the sem image in figs 3 b and edx image in fig s4b supporting information while using de as fs the calcium silicate layer can be observed on the support layer completely covering the membrane surface similar appearance of calcium silicate can be observed on the support layer along with sodium chloride crystals when using ww as fs see fig 3d and fig s4d supporting information it has been reported earlier that silica colloids can cause serious homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation over the membrane surface and cause a flux decline by pore blocking bell et al 2017 kim et al 2020 in the present study this layer is found as deposits on the polysulfone support layer side which resulted in a net decline in osmotic pressure gradient causing an overall flux decline 3ps has higher flux than ww and de because it has no silica to form colloid scale layer as discussed above therefore colloidal scaling on the support layer surface is the second reason for the fo flux decline the tfc fo membranes used in this study have an active polyamide layer which is more hydrophilic and negatively charged to produce higher nutrient and micro pollutant removal viet et al 2019 this negative surface charge and electrostatic repulsion may result in the attachment of positive ions to the membrane surface chekli et al 2018 the wo ds used in this study contains several positively charged ions thus nacl and caso4 crystals can be seen on active layers of all experiments presented in the sem images fig 3 a c e g and edx images fig s4 a c e g in the supporting information the calcium ions can have interfacial interactions with carboxylic groups of polyamide and it can serve as a bridge between various foulants and membrane active layers gou et al 2018 the attachment of calcium ions on the active layer can stimulate caso4 scaling kim et al 2020 xie and gray 2016 it is interesting to note that with ro reject as fs caso4 was present on both sides of the membrane surface as shown in sem images in figs 3g and 3h and edx images in figs s4g and s4h supporting information though crystals are more pronounced on the active layer one main reason for this could be an inverse relationship between solubility of calcium sulfate as gypsum and temperature in an aqueous solution containing higher concentrations of chlorides li and demopoulos 2006 zarga et al 2013 as draw streams have a relatively higher temperature of 40 c compared to the feed streams 22 2 c more insoluble caso4 was available for crystallization over the active layer another reason could be the presence of almost 10 time higher concentration of calcium ions in wo compared to the fs among other foulants nacl crystals were mostly observed on the active layers as seen in sem images in fig 3 a c e g thus the third main reason for the fo flux decline is most probably the caso4 and nacl crystals deposition on the active polyamide layer causing diluted ecp the fouling characteristic of an fo process with produced water shows that niche pre treatment technologies for calcium and silicon removal can be introduced for sustainable operation 3 1 1 salts transfer across the fo membrane it was noted that the actual fs conductivity was always greater than the calculated conductivity for all cases table 3 shows the values of cumulative gain of conductivities for the fs and ds in all four fo experiments this increase may be attributed to the increase of fs temperature from its initial inlet value of 22 2 c to 27 1 c as depicted in fig 4 since the operating temperature of fo ds was maintained constant at 40 c it caused heat transfer across the membrane and heated up the feed streams in the first two hours to reach thermal equilibrium around 27 1 c this heat transfer triggered intermittent heating and caused a positive fluctuation in the ds temperature and an increase in its actual conductivity the fs and ds conductivities increased due to increase in the dissociation constant of different salts and reduction in the viscosity of water using linear interpolation eq 1 the average increase in conductivity is about 2 per degree celsius increase in temperature looking at srsf values in table 3 one can notice that the ro reject had the smallest value 0 60 because it was the stream with lowest concentration of monovalent salts that contribute easily towards icp so srsf was found directly proportional to the concentration of monovalent salts in the fs bell and co workers bell et al 2017 reported similar results and concluded that with higher scale layer formation on the feed side the negatively charged ions of the layer attracts the positive ions from the ds which increases the rsf similarly anion rsf from ds is found to interact with the cations in the fs to cause severity of fouling and flux decline li et al 2015 the negative impact of rsf can be found in the form of increased fouling propensity loss of ds and osmotic pressure akther et al 2015 therefore the fourth main reason for fo flux decline can be attributed to rsf triggered by the higher concentration of monovalent salts in the fs from the discussion of section 3 1 it can be concluded that the concept of simultaneous treatment of different produced water streams can generate fairly stable fo fluxes which are comparable to the fluxes reported in the literature for similar types of feed streams al hawli et al 2019 bhinder et al 2015 the fluxes were found mainly dependent on the composition of feed streams furthermore it can be inferred that icp caused by the monovalent salts in the fs was the first main reason for flux decline colloidal calcium silicate scaling on the support layer side was the second main reason the dilutive ecp on the active layer side caused by the caso4 and nacl crystals deposition was the third main reason for flux decline finally the rsf from the ds triggered by the concentration of monovalent salts in the fs was the fourth main reason for flux decline during simultaneous treatment of produced water streams 3 2 flux stability and membrane fouling scaling in standalone md 3 2 1 effect of md feed temperature in order to further validate the concept of simultaneous treatment of produced waters the use of wo as md fs must be able to yield a practical and stable flux md experiments were operated with wo stream and nacl solution with a tds concentration similar to that of wo around 97 g l as fs fig 5 a nacl fs was used as a reference to assess the severity of scaling and fouling while treating wo as md fs the initial fluxes of both wo and nacl respectively were the same at different temperatures 15 61 and 15 63 lmh at 60 c and 23 2 and 22 78 lmh at 70 c before declining at different concentration factors the gradual decline in fluxes with nacl is most probably attributed to the decline of vapor pressure with time due to the increase of feed concentration the average fluxes for nacl after 20 h operation were 22 34 and 16 10 lmh with final fluxes of 20 8 and 15 67 lmh at 70 c and 60 c respectively no membrane wetting was observed fig 5b and a concentration factor of about 2 3 65 water recovery was achieved since there was no other contaminant present in the fs and flux was quite stable it can be inferred that nacl is not the flux limiting factor in the md system under our experimental conditions our findings are in accordance with the findings of viet and co workers viet et al 2020 who revealed that monovalent ions like sodium can interact with organic functional groups and form aggregates but they do not normally deposit over the membrane surface and hence flux is not much affected clean membrane with very little nacl traces can be seen in the sem image in fig 6 a and edx image in fig s5a supporting information the average md fluxes for wo 20 h operation were 8 90 14 41 and 12 06 lmh with initial fluxes of 11 19 16 56 23 20 lmh and final fluxes of 7 97 12 26 0 20 lmh for 50 60 and 70 c respectively as shown in fig 5a wo also showed the best performance in terms of flux at 60 c where the concentration factor up to 1 56 28 recovery was achieved a sudden drop in flux observed at 70 c may be attributed to the formation of a scaling layer over the membrane surface leading to lower final flux than 60 c sem image presented in fig 6b and edx in fig s5b supporting information shows the deposition of calcium sulfate crystals on the membrane surface this reduction in flux could occur mainly due to the partial blockage of the membrane pores or by the formation of a scaling layer on the membrane surface lee et al 2020 in our study it shows more of a partial blockage of membrane pores caso4 solubility is expected to be inversely proportional to the solution temperature under experimental conditions of high chlorides concentration in the wo solution li and demopoulos 2006 that is why at higher temperature 70 c more scaling was observed due to reduced solubility and more crystallization which caused a flux decline similar results were observed by lee et al 2018 while investigating red sea water md scaling using in situ oct technique vcf ranging between 1 2 3 2 and 1 4 5 respectively as wo also contains about 63 nacl by weight and we noted in reference experiments that nacl is not the flux limiting factor under our experimental conditions therefore the main reason for inorganic scaling in md could be attributed to the cacl2 that was present by about 23 by weight in the wo solution the divalent calcium ions from cacl2 have higher hydration radius and more positive charge to cause concentration polarization over the membrane surface no membrane wetting was observed and conductivity and cod results show 99 rejection fig 5b and table 4 of different inorganic and organic contaminants moreover from the sem images of fig 6c it can be observed that the crystal attachment is loose and can easily be removed by simple rinsing with the di water as also observed recently in another study kim et al 2020 due to relatively better flux caused by less scaling propensity 60 c was selected as the optimum operating temperature for the remaining experiments similar temperature has also been regarded as an optimum for md operations gryta 2020 hou et al 2015 the average flux achieved in our study 14 41 lmh at 60 c is comparable to the fluxes reported elsewhere under similar operational conditions gryta 2020 ricceri et al 2019 3 2 2 effect of humic acid to understand the md membrane fouling mechanism the effect of ha addition on the md flux and permeate quality was investigated ha is found in aquatic environments as natural organic matter nom and is considered as a main organic foulant in md khan et al 2019 lee et al 2020 different concentrations of humic acid 20 60 and 80 mg l were added to wo fs the concentration range was selected following an earlier investigation by hou and co workers hou et al 2015 the effect of ha on md flux and permeate conductivity is reported in figs 7 a and 7b respectively it was observed that the dcmd flux reduces by 6 with 20 mg l ha compared to the flux generated by the wo solution alone the initial and final fluxes were 16 59 lmh and 0 19 lmh respectively with maximum concentration factor of 1 44 it is expected that due to the low operating pressure of md the ha aggregates on the membrane surface in less compact layers which can be single or double however from the fig 8 c a homogenous single layer can be observed ha fouling may become severe in the presence of divalent calcium ions as it can act as a binder between carboxylic groups of two ha molecules hou et al 2015 khan et al 2019 therefore one can reassert the known fact that the ha layer thickness is not governed by the concentration of ha in the feed stream but by the concentration of calcium ions in the solution instead that is why almost similar flux trends were observed with different concentrations of ha 20 60 and 80 mg l while the concentration of calcium ions was the same moreover calcium ions also have the ability to reduce the electrostatic repulsion between ha molecules and ptfe membrane to facilitate its attachment on the membrane surface as calcium ions were significantly present in the wo solution their role in enhancing the effect of ha fouling cannot be ignored ha also have the ability to migrate through membrane pore via adsorption desorption mechanism by hydrogen bonding between water and ha laqbaqbi et al 2017 however in this study the conductivity and cod of permeate solution table 4 remained unchanged which confirms a complete membrane selectivity to ha and the impact on flux was limited to the surface fouling only as shown in sem image in fig 8a and edx image in s5c in supporting information the caso4 crystals can also be seen on the membrane surface the addition of ha probably resulted in more tenacious crystals compared to loosely bound crystals observed without ha that is why rinsing with di water was not that much effective as extensively investigated kim et al 2020 and traces can be found over the membrane surface in the sem image of fig 8b thus co presence of calcium ions and humic acid in the solution is likely the main reason for tenacious caso4 crystals 3 2 3 effect of oil and grease in the next stage of the investigation on the fouling mechanism and flux the effect of oil and grease was evaluated hydrophobic membranes are prone to fouling by the oil due to strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions the low surface energy of these membranes accelerates the pore wetting process oil and grease are unique foulants and cannot be treated like solid particle of which shape does not change under md operating pressure in fact oil droplets can deform and cleave to pass through membrane pores which are technically smaller than their sizes in md oil droplets are less prone to deformation than in pressured membrane processes ghaffour and qamar 2020 oil in wastewater can appear in three different states based on droplet size namely free oil 150 µm dispersed oil 20 150 µm and emulsified oil 20 µm tanudjaja et al 2019 actually all larger size droplets can easily be removed through floatation and separation processes while the smaller emulsified oil droplets remain difficult to eliminate and may affect the md process fouling with oil droplets can occur either in the form of a hydrophobic layer above the actual membrane active layer or through partial or complete pore blocking while the oil layer can seriously affect the flux through the md system the membrane wetting can allow non volatile salts to cross the membrane and contaminate the permeate solution to ultimately deteriorate its quality from fig 9 a it is observed that addition of oil causes further reduction in the overall flux to curtail the concentration factor to 1 40 20 recovery with initial and final fluxes of 18 lmh and 1 4 lmh respectively this is approximately 2 less flux compared to the case where wo with ha 20 mg l was used as md feed although no wetting was observed oil traces can be seen to partially cover the membrane surface even after rinsing with di water as shown in fig 10 b also in the sem image of fig 10a and the edx image of fig s5d supporting information the oil can be seen as carbon deposits over the surface of caso4 crystals same results of partial pore clogging by oil while using almost similar oil concentration 40 mg l were observed by other researchers gryta 2020 han et al 2017 therefore predominantly the oil and grease fouling mechanism in our experimental conditions was attributed to partial pore clogging which did not affect the flux severely the md experiments presented in this study indicate that the range of oil and grease concentration in the produced water samples allows further application of md processes on the other hand the impact of partial fouling shown in the results requires further investigation for long term operations 3 3 md flux recovery with edta edta is a well known hexa dentate ligand that has the intrinsic ability to attach metals and form chelates additionally edta and its derivatives are supposed to be part of a fouling mitigation strategy against divalent cations especially calcium ding and co workers ding et al 2020 used ethylenediamine tetra methylenephosphonic acid sodium salt edtmpa na as a fo ds and observed that its rsf into the fs reduces effectively the formation of calcium sulfate scales on the membrane surface therefore two different concentrations of edta 0 001 m and 0 0005 m were added to the wo solution already containing 20 mg l ha and 40 mg l oil and grease interestingly a complete flux recovery was observed with 0 001 m edta as shown in fig 11 a the concentration factor of 1 58 was achieved with initial and final fluxes of 16 94 and 0 32 lmh respectively one reason for this could be the masking of some of the calcium ions in the edta complex which reduced their negative impact on flux that is why more flux recovery was observed with higher concentration of edta 0 001 m and almost no recovery was observed with lower concentration 0 0005 m leading to a maximum concentration factor of 1 38 further higher concentrations of edta 0 001 m were not tested because it is not economically feasible moreover since 0 001 m edta can bring the ph of wo solution to 3 5 a higher concentration will make it even more acidic the drop in ph can reduce the dissociation of ha and reduce its chances for adsorption on the membrane hou et al 2015 hence this might be the second reason for flux improvement with edta addition in same study on dcmd edta was found effective to reduce ha fouling by the removal of calcium ions hou et al 2015 the mechanism of calcium ion entrapment by edta is presented by li and co workers li et al 2019 and is reproduced in fig 12 c the caso4 crystals along with nacl crystals can be observed in sem images in fig 12a and edx image in fig s5e supporting information rinsing with di water was not effective to completely remove the tenacious crystals from the membrane surface hence it can be concluded that edta can recover the flux by partially masking the divalent ions specially the calcium ions and by reducing the dissociation of ha however it cannot halt oil and grease from causing partial membrane clogging 3 4 fo and md fluxes through integrated fo md system to further validate the concept fo md hybrid experiments were conducted with integrated fo md setup see details in section 2 1 and 2 4 it can be seen in fig 13 b that md fluxes were dependent upon the fo fluxes streams which produced good fo fluxes resulted in higher md fluxes like 10 86 lmh and 11 12 lmh with de and ro reject respectively conductivity of permeate remained below 50 µs cm for three feed streams except for 3ps for which a jump to 436 µs cm was observed after 13 hours of operation suggesting partial pore wetting this probably happened due to higher concentration of oil and grease 32 mg l in 3ps feed stream which reduced the fo flux to an average value of 4 83 lmh this caused the concentration factor of wo solution md fs to increase up to 1 17 instead of decreasing below 1 0 like for the other three streams at higher cf extensive scaling took place which resulted in partial pore wetting and increased the conductivity of permeate extensive scaling can be observed in the sem image in fig 14 and edx images in fig 0s5f supporting information the sustainable operation of the fo md hybrid system was successfully presented with the selected experimental conditions in this section moreover the experimental results were able to provide an insight on a continuous operation of an fo md hybrid system 3 5 quality and reuse of product water stream results of md permeate quality presented in table 4 shows that it is very high in quality and rejection of different salts and organics was generally above 99 comparable rejections for inorganic and organic compounds 98 99 respectively is reported in the literature ding et al 2020 gryta 2020 a slight reduction in ph of the product water from initial to the end of each experiment was observed which is described in table 4 it can be explained with the fact that di water was used as md coolant which is purified to the highest standards with absence of organics inorganic dissolved species particulate matter volatile contaminants and dissolved gases this property makes this water an excellent solvent that can dissolve atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid which can lower the ph of the permeate solution down to 4 alpatova et al 2020 average conductivities of md permeate are also mentioned in table 4 and they were mostly below 35 µs cm which reflects a very good quality initial and final cods of permeate were always zero confirming no transfer of organics across the membrane as per royal commission standards the storage capacity for untreated wastewater must be of 3 days at industrial sites so the concentration of feed streams will reduce the volume of storage reservoirs also the concentrated feed streams can be sent to the evaporation ponds or mineral recovery technologies to extract water and useful minerals the product water easily meets royal commission standards for water quality discharge to coastal waters and irrigation water quality standards environmental control department 2004 4 conclusions in this study a novel fo md hybrid for the treatment of produced water was experimentally validated it enabled simultaneous treatment and reuse of different streams available at the same industrial oil extraction site these streams include effluents from desalter separator and ro treatment equipment which all contribute to the final wo volume the wo stream 97 g l was used as ds for fo and feed for md in an integrated hybrid fo md system using feed water streams with different concentrations between 4 8 6 9 g l generated fairly stable fo fluxes ranging between 8 30 lmh and 26 78 lmh these fluxes were mainly dependent on the composition of feed streams and srsf was found directly proportional to the concentration of monovalent salts therein the fouling of the fo membrane resulted from the contribution of different mechanisms to which icp inside the support layer and ecp on the active layer did contribute significantly the most dominant mechanism was found to be colloidal calcium silicate scaling on the support layer on the other hand md average flux of 14 41 lmh was achieved while treating the wo stream at a feed and permeate temperatures of 60 c and 20 c respectively pore blocking due to caso4 formation stands among the main reasons for md flux decline the co presence of additional humic acid and already available calcium ions in the feed increased the severity of fouling and reduced the flux further by 6 compared to wo flux without humic acid furthermore scale resulting from humic acids and caso4 is tenacious and cannot be completely removed from the membrane surface through simple rinsing with di water interestingly in our standalone md experiments the emulsified oil and grease fouling mechanism was partial pore blocking without wetting with only 2 flux decline a complete md flux recovery was possible by using edta to partially mask the divalent calcium ions and reduce the dissociation of humic acids however in integrated fo md experiments the md flux was linked to the fo flux directly with de and ro reject as fs streams wo produced stable md fluxes of 10 86 lmh and 11 12 lmh respectively product water has zero cod and typical ph 7 1 3 with conductivity 35 µs cm and can be used for various industrial purposes further investigations in this area like pre treatment methods validation with real produced water streams and membrane cleaning

17006,forward osmosis membrane distillation fo md hybrids were recently found suitable for produced water treatment exclusion of synthetic chemical draw solutions typically used for fo can reduce fo md operational costs and ease its onsite application this study experimentally validates a novel concept for the simultaneous treatment of different produced water streams available at the same industrial site using an fo md hybrid system the water oil separator outlet wo stream was selected as fo draw solution and it generated average fluxes ranging between 8 30 lmh and 26 78 lmh with four different feed streams fo fluxes were found to be governed by the complex composition of the feed streams on the other hand with wo stream as md feed an average flux of 14 41 lmh was achieved calcium ions were found as a main reason for md flux decline in the form of caso4 scaling and stimulating the interaction between the membrane and humic acid molecules to form scale layer causing reduction in heat transfer and decline in md flux 6 emulsified oil solution was responsible for partial pore clogging resulting in further 2 flux decline ethylenediaminetetraaceticacid edta was able to mask a portion of calcium ions and resulted in a complete recovery of the original md flux under hybrid fo md experiments md fluxes between 5 62 lmh and 11 12 lmh were achieved therefore the novel concept is validated to produce fairly stable fo and md fluxes with few streams without severe fouling and producing excellent product water quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords produced water oil and grease fo md hybrid fo and md fouling scaling edta 1 introduction in oil exploration activities a significant quantity of fresh water is injected to facilitate petroleum recovery after injection this water returns back to the surface loaded with hydrocarbons salts and other contaminants commonly known as produced water xu et al 2018 this water represents one of the largest streams of process wastewater generated in the industry dickhout et al 2017 produced water contains a mixture of dissolved and particulate organic and inorganic chemicals and its characteristics change with time the quantity produced varies greatly depending on the location and age of the petroleum reservoir generally it is about 7 8 times larger in volume than the oil extracted al furaiji et al 2019 however due to ageing of wells the oil production reduces therefore it is estimated that the volume ratio between produced water to oil production may globally ramp up to 12 by 2025 jiménez et al 2018 which will increase the need for efficient produced water treatment strategies crude oil is extracted as a mixture of gas oil and water and is separated in a three phase separator vessel the principle of three phase separator is based on gravity which allows water to settle at the bottom of the separator then discharged as a wastewater stream referred as 3ps in this study soliman et al 2020 the salt content of crude oil consists of different salts dissolved in small oil droplets refineries desalt crude oil using fresh water or sometimes a mixture of fresh and treated water jointly termed as wash water ww the desalting of oil with ww results in the generation of the desalter effluent de this de is a stable emulsion of oil in water which must be treated before disposal ahmed et al 2020 after a suitable treatment produced water can meet stringent environmental standards and reduce the load over fresh water resources elmaleh and ghaffour 1996 wenzlick and siefert 2020 it can serve as a valuable water resource for various applications including reinjection into the wells before reinjection the produced water is passed through a water oil separator commonly called wosep a good quality of wosep outlet wo treated water will eventually improve the receiving ground water quality a schematic diagram illustrating various produced water streams is shown in fig s1 in the supporting information it can be seen that other waste streams de ww 3ps ro reject contribute to the wo stream volume hence its volume can be controlled reduced by the treatment and reuse of these streams the selection of unit operations for the treatment of produced water remains challenging due to its complex composition and the high quality requirements of the treated water chang et al 2019 microfiltration mf or ultrafiltration uf of produced water using ceramic or polymeric membranes requires extensive pre treatment and in some cases also post treatment to improve the treated effluent quality electrodialysis ed can remove ionic salts from the produced water but it cannot remove organics and requires periodic disposal of concentrate al ghouti et al 2019 on the other hand reverse osmosis ro is not a viable solution for the treatment of produced water as ro membranes cannot directly withstand high temperatures associated with produced water which requires extensive cooling before entering the treatment system al ghouti et al 2019 concentration of total dissolved solids tds in produced water may reach 400 000 mg l which is far beyond the typical salinity limit of ro 70 000 mg l jiménez et al 2018 other distillation techniques like multi effect distillation med and multistage flash msf can be used for the treatment of highly saline solutions but remain energy intensive and costly processes ghaffour et al 2019 biological treatment of produced water is only feasible when oil and grease concentration is less than 60 mg l and chlorides are less than 6600 mg l su et al 2007 however chlorides concentration in different types of produced water streams may go up to 250 000 mg l jiménez et al 2018 other traditional techniques like hydrocylcone gravity separation and media filters cannot meet treated water quality that is suitable for recycling and reuse so sophisticated treatment technologies must be adopted bagheri et al 2018 membrane distillation md is considered as a potential technology for produced water treatment the driving force in md is the vapor pressure difference between the two sides of the membrane pore generally triggered by temperature difference between two bulk solutions kim et al 2019a md combines the advantages of conventional distillation with membrane filtration the water that evaporates at the hot feed side having higher vapor pressure condenses at the cold permeate side of the membrane having lower vapor pressure md produces water with nearly distilled quality even with nearly saturated saline streams al furaiji et al 2019 md is compact and supposed to be less susceptible to fouling than pressure driven membrane processes politano et al 2017 there are several studies available in the literature on the use of md for produced water treatment the flux in air gap membrane distillation agmd was found directly proportional to the feed temperature and energy consumption was found independent of the membrane pore size alkhudhiri et al 2013 as such a direct contact md dcmd exhibited 99 inorganics and 90 total carbon removal from produced water macedonio et al 2014 dcmd flux while treating produced water was found inversely proportional to the module length due to the reduction of driving force along the module channel xu et al 2018 the capability of md to utilize the available low grade heat which is generally available in produced water contributes in reducing the overall energy consumption tong and elimelech 2016 among different configurations of md the dcmd is most commonly used mainly for its simplicity soukane et al 2021 but other configurations such as agmd possess a higher thermal efficiency alsaadi et al 2015 another emerging membrane technology used in desalination of hypersaline solutions is forward osmosis fo the fo process utilizes natural osmotic pressure difference across the membrane as the driving force for water transport the use of a solution of higher salinity high osmotic pressure termed as draw solution ds enables freshwater recovery from targeted feed solution fs of relatively lower salinity thus lower osmotic pressure nawaz et al 2016 the fo process rejects complex organic and inorganic contaminants present in fs kim et al 2019b it utilizes energy mainly for recirculation of ds and fs and does not require any hydraulic pressure however once ds is diluted with extracted water its re concentration regeneration is critical to sustain the driving force and ensure the continuous operation of the fo system kim et al 2017 hybrid technologies are a combination of more than one technology to enhance benefits in terms of improved water quality lower operational energy and equipment footprint although ro md might be seen as a potential hybrid for the treatment of high concentration streams it presents potential drawbacks within the scope of produced water treatment indeed ro cannot be fed with wo due to its high temperature and cannot be placed in series with md due to possible salinity increase in md output to values as high as 130 g l moreover ro anti scalants may have negative impacts on md flux liu et al 2021 yan et al 2017 recent investigations found fo md hybrid system promising for various applications arcanjo et al 2020 lee et al 2018 li et al 2020 volpin et al 2019 in a fo md system the drawbacks of both processes can be reduced by regenerating ds of fo by the md process and hindering evaporative contaminants surfactants and trace organics by the fo process ghaffour et al 2019 xie et al 2013 the studies available in literature on produced water treatment using fo and md systems utilize synthetic ds al furaiji et al 2019 these ds are prepared by addition of at least one chemical to fresh water to serve simultaneously as ds for fo and fs for md chekli et al 2017 this requires on site availability of fresh water and salts which brings in additional control requirements equipment and associated operation costs therefore there is a particular need to investigate a more sustainable way that involves no use of fresh water and salts as ds to operate fo md for on site treatment of produced water in this study we present a novel concept of simultaneous utilization of different produced water streams generated at the same site depending on the stream characteristics the produced water could be used as fo fs or ds the stream with highest tds and lower oil and grease concentrations could be used as a ds while the relatively diluted streams can be used as fs to recover valuable water increase their concentration and reduce their volume thus making them suitable for evaporation or other zero liquid discharge zld process the diluted ds will then pass through dcmd for regeneration and produce high quality permeate water in such a configuration fs streams will pass through a double barrier of very selective fo and md membranes leaving behind most of the contaminants however it is also expected that due to the presence of various contaminants in the ds stream the flux through fo and md would experience more decline compared to single salt ds like nacl only this study starts with a feasibility assessment of the hybrid concept in treating different produced water streams simultaneously with emphasis on fluxes stability for both fo and dcmd processes a systematic investigation will follow to identify the dominant mechanism of fo and md membranes fouling and scaling due to the presence of complex contaminants in the feed and draw streams the concept is also verified with new integrated fo md module which includes a thermal and osmotic dual function isolation barrier son et al 2021 in order to have a better understanding of fouling mechanisms stable synthetic produced water mimicking the main composition of real produced water collected from a local industrial site is used this study will serve as a baseline to identify and eliminate any critical factors that can cause flux or permeate quality decline 2 materials and methods 2 1 formulation of synthetic produced water streams five streams were identified from local industrial sites and their samples were collected the names of streams abbreviations used in the manuscript tds concentrations and osmotic pressures are presented in table 1 detailed characterization of all five streams reported in table s1 in the supporting information was performed using advanced analytical techniques and standard methods apha 2006 based on their tds concentrations four streams were selected as potential fs and one wo as potential ds for fo based on the detailed characterization results the composition of synthetic produced water was established see first part of table 2 all elements present in real streams were added in similar molar concentrations glucose was added to represent chemical oxygen demand cod concentration and colloidal silica to represent mainly the turbidity and total suspended solids tss concentration the standalone fo experiments were carried out using the composition in table 2 without adding oil and grease to estimate the effect of other parameters on the flux however in integrated fo md experiments exact oil and grease concentrations were used for all 5 streams part two of table 2 lists the three chemicals which were used only for the systematic investigation of md membrane fouling in standalone md experiments maximum oil and grease concentration in any stream was found to be 32 mg l table s1 that is why a range of 30 50 mg l was studied to mimic a worst case scenario the oil used was a standard emulsion of oil in water with tiny droplets to mimic the most challenging type of oil presence humic acid ha is used as model foulant for natural organic matter a ha concentration range of 20 80 mg l was selected following similar investigations khan et al 2019 lee et al 2020 similarly edta is considered as a masking agent for the bivalent metals hence it was also used in the concentration range 0 001 m to 0 0005 m as described elsewhere kim et al 2020 however in the integrated fo md experiments ha and edta were not added the synthetic streams were always freshly prepared prior to each experiment all chemicals were of reagent grade and were received from sigma aldrich fisher scientific or alfa aesar and used without any additional processing 2 2 fo and md membranes for the fo experiments thin film composite polyamide tfc pa hydrophilic fo membranes were used the membranes were purchased from toray chemicals korea the thicknesses of the active and support layers are 0 86 0 1 and 99 14 1 3 μm respectively the support layer porosity is 63 5 water permeability of the fo membrane afo is 2 472e 7 m s bar solute permeability bfo is 5 444e 8 m s and structure parameter sfo is 3 28e 4 m additional details on this membrane can be found elsewhere lee and ghaffour 2019 in md experiments polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe hydrophobic microporous membranes purchased from membrane solutions china were used the measured nominal pore size and porosity are 0 22 0 06 μm and 39 59 4 7 respectively thicknesses of the active layer ptfe and the support layer pp are 20 0 4 and 80 1 6 μm respectively and the liquid entry pressure lep is 3 74 bar the membranes size was 6 cm 1 6 cm for both fo and md modules which gives an active area of 0 00096 m2 2 3 experimental setups and procedures for standalone fo and md experiments two laboratory scale setups were installed for fo and md equipment source and models were generally the same for both setups schematic diagrams of standalone fo and md batch setups are shown in fig s2a and s2b respectively the fo setup consists of two variable speed gear pumps 75211 70 cole parmer usa a standard membrane cell a weighing balance me3002e mettler toledo usa and a temperature controller with water bath and heat exchangers ad07r 20 a13d polyscience usa the membrane cell has two symmetric channels i e 60 mm long 16 mm wide and 3 mm deep on both sides of the membrane one channel was fed with the feed stream and the other was fed with a draw stream variable speed gear pumps were used to provide crossflows under counter current directions the flowrate was set to 250 ml min which gives a fluid average crossflow velocity of 8 7 cm s initial fs temperature was at laboratory temperature 22 2 c while the ds temperature was maintained at 40 c throughout the experiment the latter was found to be the optimum temperature for ds and it is achievable in large scale md feed outlet temperature lee and ghaffour 2019 volpin et al 2019 both solutions were recirculated in a closed loop system resulting in a batch mode process operation the ds tank was placed on a digital weighing balance and the weight changes were recorded the fo experiments were carried out for 20 h with an initial volume of 1 l for both ds and fs a new membrane coupon was used for each experiment after which it was air dried and stored for imaging and characterization purposes the conductivities of both feed and ds were recorded in all fo experiments an active layer facing the ds al ds mode was used because the draw stream had very high tds compared to the feed streams the lab scale dcmd set up fig s2b is composed of two variable speed micro gear pumps a standard membrane cell a digital weighing balance and two temperature controllers the membrane cell has two symmetric channels i e 60 mm long 16 mm wide and 3 mm deep on both sides of the membrane one was fed with md feed and the other was fed with md permeate di water initial volumes of both md permeate and feed were set to 1 l each in all md experiments the active layer was facing md fs different fs temperatures were used while the permeate temperature was maintained at 20 c both feed and permeate temperatures were measured at the inlet of the module using sensors md experiments were continued until negligible flux below 2 lmh was observed a new membrane coupon from the same original sheet was used for each experiment after which it was air dried cut into two parts one was rinsed with di water for two minutes and the other left without rinsing and stored for imaging and characterization the conductivity of permeate solution was measured with a conductivity meter tetracon 325 with lf 298 wtw usa to monitor any salt leakage through md membrane additionally the ph of both feed and permeate solutions were measured at the beginning and after completion of the experiment the cod of permeate was also measured using hg free hach vials 3 150 mg l range to assess any leakage of volatile organics through the membrane for membrane surface characterization the stored dried membranes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy sem gemini ii carl zeiss smt ag germany and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx at an accelerating voltage of 3 kv and 20 kv respectively 2 4 experimental setups and procedures for integrated fo md experiments an in house designed integrated fo md module with an osmotic and thermal isolation barrier as depicted in fig 1 is used in this study kim et al 2019a the integrated module has four symmetric channels 100 mm long 20 mm wide and 3 mm deep the top channel was fed with fo fs and the bottom channel with md permeate the middle channels were fed with md fs which also serves as fo ds similar to the batch experiments md fs temperature was maintained at 60 c while md permeate was set at 20 c regarding fo the fs was initially at laboratory temperature 22 2 c similar to standalone experiments the al ds configuration was used for fo membrane and al fs md fs configuration for the md membrane countercurrent cross flow velocities were maintained at an average of 8 7 cm s with a 315 ml min flow rate the operating principle of the integrated fo md module with the barrier consists of flowing first the ds at 60 c into the channel as md fs at one side of the barrier to fully utilize its heat and maximize the md flux the same relatively concentrated ds after losing some heat and vapors to md permeate flows to the other side of the isolation barrier where it serves as fo ds fig s3 starting volume of both fo fs and fo ds was 1 l while md permeate was 0 5 l experiments were continued until either fo or md flux reached a constant minimum value below 2 lmh composition of wo and other streams was kept exactly as reported in part 1 of table 2 2 5 calculation of salt transfer across the fo membrane the salt transfer across the membrane was estimated by continuously monitoring the actual conductivity values of the fs and ds calculated values of conductivities were estimated with the assumption of zero salt transfer across the membrane and represent the actual initial conductivity divided by the cumulative volume of fs or ds at the end of the experiment these calculated values were subtracted from the actual conductivities to estimate the amount of salt transferred however regarding the fs any increase in the conductivity was either due to rsf or increase in the bulk fs temperature the increase due to temperature was calculated using eq 1 and the remainder was attributed to rsf the specific rsf srsf was obtained by dividing the rsf by the flux it is important to mention here that due to the assumptions made above the srsf values cannot be 100 correct and some margins of error must be kept into account 1 ec 1 a t 25 e c 25 with a 0 020 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux stability and membrane fouling scaling in standalone fo in order to carry out a complete experimental validation of the concept all four streams de ww 3ps ro reject were separately used as fo fs with wo as ds since all the experiments were executed under the same initial operating conditions as described in section 2 3 the difference in flux could be attributed to the composition of the different feed streams as shown in fig 2 a sharp decline of water flux was observed between the 1st h and 6th h of operation for de 3ps and ww followed by gradual flux stabilization achieved after 10th h this initial sharp decline was mainly due to the dilution of ds and loss of osmotic potential however for ro reject feed the flux showed a continuous decline almost linearly during the whole experiment with an overall highest flux compared to the other streams this could be attributed to the absence of silica colloids and low concentration of sodium chloride in the ro reject see table 2 silica colloids are found to make polymerized silica layer after interacting with tfc pa membrane on which it attaches firmly due to the si o bond kim et al 2020 however comparing the compositions of 3ps and ro reject silica is absent in both solutions and the tds concentration of 3ps is lower than ro reject 4 85 vs 6 02 g l but still the average flux of ro reject is higher 26 78 lmh compared to 3ps 14 75 lmh the main difference in their compositions is the high nacl concentration in 3ps 1045 mg l compared to ro reject 213 mg l in al ds configuration a polarized layer is established inside the porous support layer of fo membrane due to the diffusion of smallest radius monovalent salts like nacl leading to internal concentration polarization icp which reduces the overall flux lee et al 2020 thus icp caused by monovalent salts is probably the first main reason for the fo flux decline furthermore ro reject is expected to have less fouling compared to other streams because of its advanced pre treatment prior to the ro process which may explain the absence of the sharp decline of the initial fo flux looking at the sem image in figs 3 b and edx image in fig s4b supporting information while using de as fs the calcium silicate layer can be observed on the support layer completely covering the membrane surface similar appearance of calcium silicate can be observed on the support layer along with sodium chloride crystals when using ww as fs see fig 3d and fig s4d supporting information it has been reported earlier that silica colloids can cause serious homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation over the membrane surface and cause a flux decline by pore blocking bell et al 2017 kim et al 2020 in the present study this layer is found as deposits on the polysulfone support layer side which resulted in a net decline in osmotic pressure gradient causing an overall flux decline 3ps has higher flux than ww and de because it has no silica to form colloid scale layer as discussed above therefore colloidal scaling on the support layer surface is the second reason for the fo flux decline the tfc fo membranes used in this study have an active polyamide layer which is more hydrophilic and negatively charged to produce higher nutrient and micro pollutant removal viet et al 2019 this negative surface charge and electrostatic repulsion may result in the attachment of positive ions to the membrane surface chekli et al 2018 the wo ds used in this study contains several positively charged ions thus nacl and caso4 crystals can be seen on active layers of all experiments presented in the sem images fig 3 a c e g and edx images fig s4 a c e g in the supporting information the calcium ions can have interfacial interactions with carboxylic groups of polyamide and it can serve as a bridge between various foulants and membrane active layers gou et al 2018 the attachment of calcium ions on the active layer can stimulate caso4 scaling kim et al 2020 xie and gray 2016 it is interesting to note that with ro reject as fs caso4 was present on both sides of the membrane surface as shown in sem images in figs 3g and 3h and edx images in figs s4g and s4h supporting information though crystals are more pronounced on the active layer one main reason for this could be an inverse relationship between solubility of calcium sulfate as gypsum and temperature in an aqueous solution containing higher concentrations of chlorides li and demopoulos 2006 zarga et al 2013 as draw streams have a relatively higher temperature of 40 c compared to the feed streams 22 2 c more insoluble caso4 was available for crystallization over the active layer another reason could be the presence of almost 10 time higher concentration of calcium ions in wo compared to the fs among other foulants nacl crystals were mostly observed on the active layers as seen in sem images in fig 3 a c e g thus the third main reason for the fo flux decline is most probably the caso4 and nacl crystals deposition on the active polyamide layer causing diluted ecp the fouling characteristic of an fo process with produced water shows that niche pre treatment technologies for calcium and silicon removal can be introduced for sustainable operation 3 1 1 salts transfer across the fo membrane it was noted that the actual fs conductivity was always greater than the calculated conductivity for all cases table 3 shows the values of cumulative gain of conductivities for the fs and ds in all four fo experiments this increase may be attributed to the increase of fs temperature from its initial inlet value of 22 2 c to 27 1 c as depicted in fig 4 since the operating temperature of fo ds was maintained constant at 40 c it caused heat transfer across the membrane and heated up the feed streams in the first two hours to reach thermal equilibrium around 27 1 c this heat transfer triggered intermittent heating and caused a positive fluctuation in the ds temperature and an increase in its actual conductivity the fs and ds conductivities increased due to increase in the dissociation constant of different salts and reduction in the viscosity of water using linear interpolation eq 1 the average increase in conductivity is about 2 per degree celsius increase in temperature looking at srsf values in table 3 one can notice that the ro reject had the smallest value 0 60 because it was the stream with lowest concentration of monovalent salts that contribute easily towards icp so srsf was found directly proportional to the concentration of monovalent salts in the fs bell and co workers bell et al 2017 reported similar results and concluded that with higher scale layer formation on the feed side the negatively charged ions of the layer attracts the positive ions from the ds which increases the rsf similarly anion rsf from ds is found to interact with the cations in the fs to cause severity of fouling and flux decline li et al 2015 the negative impact of rsf can be found in the form of increased fouling propensity loss of ds and osmotic pressure akther et al 2015 therefore the fourth main reason for fo flux decline can be attributed to rsf triggered by the higher concentration of monovalent salts in the fs from the discussion of section 3 1 it can be concluded that the concept of simultaneous treatment of different produced water streams can generate fairly stable fo fluxes which are comparable to the fluxes reported in the literature for similar types of feed streams al hawli et al 2019 bhinder et al 2015 the fluxes were found mainly dependent on the composition of feed streams furthermore it can be inferred that icp caused by the monovalent salts in the fs was the first main reason for flux decline colloidal calcium silicate scaling on the support layer side was the second main reason the dilutive ecp on the active layer side caused by the caso4 and nacl crystals deposition was the third main reason for flux decline finally the rsf from the ds triggered by the concentration of monovalent salts in the fs was the fourth main reason for flux decline during simultaneous treatment of produced water streams 3 2 flux stability and membrane fouling scaling in standalone md 3 2 1 effect of md feed temperature in order to further validate the concept of simultaneous treatment of produced waters the use of wo as md fs must be able to yield a practical and stable flux md experiments were operated with wo stream and nacl solution with a tds concentration similar to that of wo around 97 g l as fs fig 5 a nacl fs was used as a reference to assess the severity of scaling and fouling while treating wo as md fs the initial fluxes of both wo and nacl respectively were the same at different temperatures 15 61 and 15 63 lmh at 60 c and 23 2 and 22 78 lmh at 70 c before declining at different concentration factors the gradual decline in fluxes with nacl is most probably attributed to the decline of vapor pressure with time due to the increase of feed concentration the average fluxes for nacl after 20 h operation were 22 34 and 16 10 lmh with final fluxes of 20 8 and 15 67 lmh at 70 c and 60 c respectively no membrane wetting was observed fig 5b and a concentration factor of about 2 3 65 water recovery was achieved since there was no other contaminant present in the fs and flux was quite stable it can be inferred that nacl is not the flux limiting factor in the md system under our experimental conditions our findings are in accordance with the findings of viet and co workers viet et al 2020 who revealed that monovalent ions like sodium can interact with organic functional groups and form aggregates but they do not normally deposit over the membrane surface and hence flux is not much affected clean membrane with very little nacl traces can be seen in the sem image in fig 6 a and edx image in fig s5a supporting information the average md fluxes for wo 20 h operation were 8 90 14 41 and 12 06 lmh with initial fluxes of 11 19 16 56 23 20 lmh and final fluxes of 7 97 12 26 0 20 lmh for 50 60 and 70 c respectively as shown in fig 5a wo also showed the best performance in terms of flux at 60 c where the concentration factor up to 1 56 28 recovery was achieved a sudden drop in flux observed at 70 c may be attributed to the formation of a scaling layer over the membrane surface leading to lower final flux than 60 c sem image presented in fig 6b and edx in fig s5b supporting information shows the deposition of calcium sulfate crystals on the membrane surface this reduction in flux could occur mainly due to the partial blockage of the membrane pores or by the formation of a scaling layer on the membrane surface lee et al 2020 in our study it shows more of a partial blockage of membrane pores caso4 solubility is expected to be inversely proportional to the solution temperature under experimental conditions of high chlorides concentration in the wo solution li and demopoulos 2006 that is why at higher temperature 70 c more scaling was observed due to reduced solubility and more crystallization which caused a flux decline similar results were observed by lee et al 2018 while investigating red sea water md scaling using in situ oct technique vcf ranging between 1 2 3 2 and 1 4 5 respectively as wo also contains about 63 nacl by weight and we noted in reference experiments that nacl is not the flux limiting factor under our experimental conditions therefore the main reason for inorganic scaling in md could be attributed to the cacl2 that was present by about 23 by weight in the wo solution the divalent calcium ions from cacl2 have higher hydration radius and more positive charge to cause concentration polarization over the membrane surface no membrane wetting was observed and conductivity and cod results show 99 rejection fig 5b and table 4 of different inorganic and organic contaminants moreover from the sem images of fig 6c it can be observed that the crystal attachment is loose and can easily be removed by simple rinsing with the di water as also observed recently in another study kim et al 2020 due to relatively better flux caused by less scaling propensity 60 c was selected as the optimum operating temperature for the remaining experiments similar temperature has also been regarded as an optimum for md operations gryta 2020 hou et al 2015 the average flux achieved in our study 14 41 lmh at 60 c is comparable to the fluxes reported elsewhere under similar operational conditions gryta 2020 ricceri et al 2019 3 2 2 effect of humic acid to understand the md membrane fouling mechanism the effect of ha addition on the md flux and permeate quality was investigated ha is found in aquatic environments as natural organic matter nom and is considered as a main organic foulant in md khan et al 2019 lee et al 2020 different concentrations of humic acid 20 60 and 80 mg l were added to wo fs the concentration range was selected following an earlier investigation by hou and co workers hou et al 2015 the effect of ha on md flux and permeate conductivity is reported in figs 7 a and 7b respectively it was observed that the dcmd flux reduces by 6 with 20 mg l ha compared to the flux generated by the wo solution alone the initial and final fluxes were 16 59 lmh and 0 19 lmh respectively with maximum concentration factor of 1 44 it is expected that due to the low operating pressure of md the ha aggregates on the membrane surface in less compact layers which can be single or double however from the fig 8 c a homogenous single layer can be observed ha fouling may become severe in the presence of divalent calcium ions as it can act as a binder between carboxylic groups of two ha molecules hou et al 2015 khan et al 2019 therefore one can reassert the known fact that the ha layer thickness is not governed by the concentration of ha in the feed stream but by the concentration of calcium ions in the solution instead that is why almost similar flux trends were observed with different concentrations of ha 20 60 and 80 mg l while the concentration of calcium ions was the same moreover calcium ions also have the ability to reduce the electrostatic repulsion between ha molecules and ptfe membrane to facilitate its attachment on the membrane surface as calcium ions were significantly present in the wo solution their role in enhancing the effect of ha fouling cannot be ignored ha also have the ability to migrate through membrane pore via adsorption desorption mechanism by hydrogen bonding between water and ha laqbaqbi et al 2017 however in this study the conductivity and cod of permeate solution table 4 remained unchanged which confirms a complete membrane selectivity to ha and the impact on flux was limited to the surface fouling only as shown in sem image in fig 8a and edx image in s5c in supporting information the caso4 crystals can also be seen on the membrane surface the addition of ha probably resulted in more tenacious crystals compared to loosely bound crystals observed without ha that is why rinsing with di water was not that much effective as extensively investigated kim et al 2020 and traces can be found over the membrane surface in the sem image of fig 8b thus co presence of calcium ions and humic acid in the solution is likely the main reason for tenacious caso4 crystals 3 2 3 effect of oil and grease in the next stage of the investigation on the fouling mechanism and flux the effect of oil and grease was evaluated hydrophobic membranes are prone to fouling by the oil due to strong hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions the low surface energy of these membranes accelerates the pore wetting process oil and grease are unique foulants and cannot be treated like solid particle of which shape does not change under md operating pressure in fact oil droplets can deform and cleave to pass through membrane pores which are technically smaller than their sizes in md oil droplets are less prone to deformation than in pressured membrane processes ghaffour and qamar 2020 oil in wastewater can appear in three different states based on droplet size namely free oil 150 µm dispersed oil 20 150 µm and emulsified oil 20 µm tanudjaja et al 2019 actually all larger size droplets can easily be removed through floatation and separation processes while the smaller emulsified oil droplets remain difficult to eliminate and may affect the md process fouling with oil droplets can occur either in the form of a hydrophobic layer above the actual membrane active layer or through partial or complete pore blocking while the oil layer can seriously affect the flux through the md system the membrane wetting can allow non volatile salts to cross the membrane and contaminate the permeate solution to ultimately deteriorate its quality from fig 9 a it is observed that addition of oil causes further reduction in the overall flux to curtail the concentration factor to 1 40 20 recovery with initial and final fluxes of 18 lmh and 1 4 lmh respectively this is approximately 2 less flux compared to the case where wo with ha 20 mg l was used as md feed although no wetting was observed oil traces can be seen to partially cover the membrane surface even after rinsing with di water as shown in fig 10 b also in the sem image of fig 10a and the edx image of fig s5d supporting information the oil can be seen as carbon deposits over the surface of caso4 crystals same results of partial pore clogging by oil while using almost similar oil concentration 40 mg l were observed by other researchers gryta 2020 han et al 2017 therefore predominantly the oil and grease fouling mechanism in our experimental conditions was attributed to partial pore clogging which did not affect the flux severely the md experiments presented in this study indicate that the range of oil and grease concentration in the produced water samples allows further application of md processes on the other hand the impact of partial fouling shown in the results requires further investigation for long term operations 3 3 md flux recovery with edta edta is a well known hexa dentate ligand that has the intrinsic ability to attach metals and form chelates additionally edta and its derivatives are supposed to be part of a fouling mitigation strategy against divalent cations especially calcium ding and co workers ding et al 2020 used ethylenediamine tetra methylenephosphonic acid sodium salt edtmpa na as a fo ds and observed that its rsf into the fs reduces effectively the formation of calcium sulfate scales on the membrane surface therefore two different concentrations of edta 0 001 m and 0 0005 m were added to the wo solution already containing 20 mg l ha and 40 mg l oil and grease interestingly a complete flux recovery was observed with 0 001 m edta as shown in fig 11 a the concentration factor of 1 58 was achieved with initial and final fluxes of 16 94 and 0 32 lmh respectively one reason for this could be the masking of some of the calcium ions in the edta complex which reduced their negative impact on flux that is why more flux recovery was observed with higher concentration of edta 0 001 m and almost no recovery was observed with lower concentration 0 0005 m leading to a maximum concentration factor of 1 38 further higher concentrations of edta 0 001 m were not tested because it is not economically feasible moreover since 0 001 m edta can bring the ph of wo solution to 3 5 a higher concentration will make it even more acidic the drop in ph can reduce the dissociation of ha and reduce its chances for adsorption on the membrane hou et al 2015 hence this might be the second reason for flux improvement with edta addition in same study on dcmd edta was found effective to reduce ha fouling by the removal of calcium ions hou et al 2015 the mechanism of calcium ion entrapment by edta is presented by li and co workers li et al 2019 and is reproduced in fig 12 c the caso4 crystals along with nacl crystals can be observed in sem images in fig 12a and edx image in fig s5e supporting information rinsing with di water was not effective to completely remove the tenacious crystals from the membrane surface hence it can be concluded that edta can recover the flux by partially masking the divalent ions specially the calcium ions and by reducing the dissociation of ha however it cannot halt oil and grease from causing partial membrane clogging 3 4 fo and md fluxes through integrated fo md system to further validate the concept fo md hybrid experiments were conducted with integrated fo md setup see details in section 2 1 and 2 4 it can be seen in fig 13 b that md fluxes were dependent upon the fo fluxes streams which produced good fo fluxes resulted in higher md fluxes like 10 86 lmh and 11 12 lmh with de and ro reject respectively conductivity of permeate remained below 50 µs cm for three feed streams except for 3ps for which a jump to 436 µs cm was observed after 13 hours of operation suggesting partial pore wetting this probably happened due to higher concentration of oil and grease 32 mg l in 3ps feed stream which reduced the fo flux to an average value of 4 83 lmh this caused the concentration factor of wo solution md fs to increase up to 1 17 instead of decreasing below 1 0 like for the other three streams at higher cf extensive scaling took place which resulted in partial pore wetting and increased the conductivity of permeate extensive scaling can be observed in the sem image in fig 14 and edx images in fig 0s5f supporting information the sustainable operation of the fo md hybrid system was successfully presented with the selected experimental conditions in this section moreover the experimental results were able to provide an insight on a continuous operation of an fo md hybrid system 3 5 quality and reuse of product water stream results of md permeate quality presented in table 4 shows that it is very high in quality and rejection of different salts and organics was generally above 99 comparable rejections for inorganic and organic compounds 98 99 respectively is reported in the literature ding et al 2020 gryta 2020 a slight reduction in ph of the product water from initial to the end of each experiment was observed which is described in table 4 it can be explained with the fact that di water was used as md coolant which is purified to the highest standards with absence of organics inorganic dissolved species particulate matter volatile contaminants and dissolved gases this property makes this water an excellent solvent that can dissolve atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonic acid which can lower the ph of the permeate solution down to 4 alpatova et al 2020 average conductivities of md permeate are also mentioned in table 4 and they were mostly below 35 µs cm which reflects a very good quality initial and final cods of permeate were always zero confirming no transfer of organics across the membrane as per royal commission standards the storage capacity for untreated wastewater must be of 3 days at industrial sites so the concentration of feed streams will reduce the volume of storage reservoirs also the concentrated feed streams can be sent to the evaporation ponds or mineral recovery technologies to extract water and useful minerals the product water easily meets royal commission standards for water quality discharge to coastal waters and irrigation water quality standards environmental control department 2004 4 conclusions in this study a novel fo md hybrid for the treatment of produced water was experimentally validated it enabled simultaneous treatment and reuse of different streams available at the same industrial oil extraction site these streams include effluents from desalter separator and ro treatment equipment which all contribute to the final wo volume the wo stream 97 g l was used as ds for fo and feed for md in an integrated hybrid fo md system using feed water streams with different concentrations between 4 8 6 9 g l generated fairly stable fo fluxes ranging between 8 30 lmh and 26 78 lmh these fluxes were mainly dependent on the composition of feed streams and srsf was found directly proportional to the concentration of monovalent salts therein the fouling of the fo membrane resulted from the contribution of different mechanisms to which icp inside the support layer and ecp on the active layer did contribute significantly the most dominant mechanism was found to be colloidal calcium silicate scaling on the support layer on the other hand md average flux of 14 41 lmh was achieved while treating the wo stream at a feed and permeate temperatures of 60 c and 20 c respectively pore blocking due to caso4 formation stands among the main reasons for md flux decline the co presence of additional humic acid and already available calcium ions in the feed increased the severity of fouling and reduced the flux further by 6 compared to wo flux without humic acid furthermore scale resulting from humic acids and caso4 is tenacious and cannot be completely removed from the membrane surface through simple rinsing with di water interestingly in our standalone md experiments the emulsified oil and grease fouling mechanism was partial pore blocking without wetting with only 2 flux decline a complete md flux recovery was possible by using edta to partially mask the divalent calcium ions and reduce the dissociation of humic acids however in integrated fo md experiments the md flux was linked to the fo flux directly with de and ro reject as fs streams wo produced stable md fluxes of 10 86 lmh and 11 12 lmh respectively product water has zero cod and typical ph 7 1 3 with conductivity 35 µs cm and can be used for various industrial purposes further investigations in this area like pre treatment methods validation with real produced water streams and membrane cleaning

17007,transition metal catalyzed sulfite auto oxidation is a promising technology used in water and wastewater treatment for the elimination of contaminants in the literature this process has been reported to be efficient only in the presence of oxygen however in this study we unexpectedly found that the degradation of diatrizoate dtz by a system based on the combination of copper ion and sulfite cu ii s iv reached over 95 under anaerobic conditions but was considerably retarded under aerobic conditions at ph 7 furthermore it was found that cu i generated from the cleavage of the cuso3 complex was the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions in fact the absence of oxygen promoted the accumulation of cu i the concomitant release of the iodide ion with the degradation of dtz indicated that the anaerobic degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system mainly proceeded through the deiodination pathway which was also confirmed by the detection of deiodinated products the anaerobic degradation of dtz was favored at higher initial concentrations of cu ii or sulfite in this system since the cuso3 complex the precursor of cu i was formed mainly at ph 7 the highest anaerobic degradation of dtz was achieved at ph 7 an increase in reaction temperature considerably enhanced the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system with an apparent activation energy of 119 4 kj mol the presence of chloride bicarbonate and humic acid slightly influenced the anaerobic degradation of dtz the experiments with real water samples also demonstrated the effectiveness of the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic degradation copper sulfite deiodination cu i diatrizoate 1 introduction diatrizoate dtz an iodinated contrast media compound is generally used as a medical diagnostic agent for tissue and organ imaging christiansen 2005 it can be excreted unchanged within 24 hours after each patient has taken with a large quantity 100 g dose 1 it has been reported that dtz may pose a nephrotoxic threat to humans and animals gale et al 1984 moreover iodinated contrast media compounds including dtz contribute substantially to absorbable organic halogen aox in hospital wastewater which is considered to have a potential health impact duirk et al 2011 accordingly it is required to eliminate dtz from water dtz which is chemically inert and resistant to conventional wastewater and drinking water treatments will thus be released into the environment ribbers et al 2019 redeker et al 2014 in fact dtz has been detected in wastewater surface water groundwater and even in finish drinking waters at concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l kovalova et al 2012 kormos et al 2011 w seitz et al 2006 ternes and hirsch 2000 several advanced oxidation processes aops have been studied for the degradation of dtz such as ozonation ternes et al 2003 w seitz et al 2006 fenton real et al 2009 uv fenton velo gala et al 2014 zero valent iron stieber et al 2011 chlorination ye et al 2014 uv chlorination hu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 photo activated persulfate zhou et al 2017 and sulfate mediated electrooxidation processes radjenovic and petrovic 2016 recently bi sulfite auto oxidation catalyzed by transition metals has been increasingly studied for the generation of so4 guo et al 2013 chen et al 2012 chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 compared to persulfate ps and peroxymonosulfate pms bi sulfite is a precursor of so4 more cost effective with less chronic toxicity wu et al 2021 xie et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 thus transition metal catalyzed sulfite auto oxidation systems me s iv are considered a promising process for the elimination of organic contaminants du et al 2018 xie et al 2017 among the various transition metals cu ii has proven to be an effective catalyst for the activation of sulfite auto oxidation over a wide ph range luo et al 2019 chen et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 moreover cu ii s iv system has a higher electron spin resonance esr signal than fe ii s iv co ii s iv and mn ii o2 s iv systems chen et al 2017 in the cu ii s iv system cu ii initially form a complex with sulfite as described in eq 1 conklin and hoffmann 1988 then the cuso3 complex decomposes into cu i and so3 after an inner electron transfer reaction as expressed in eq 2 in the presence of o2 so3 is oxidized to so5 which then reacts with hso3 to generate so4 as eqs 3 4 besides both so5 and so4 can also react with hso3 to be reconverted to so3 see eq 5 6 meanwhile the cu formed is again oxidized to cu2 by o2 as described in eq 7 1 cu2 so3 2 cuso3 2 cuso3 cu so3 3 so3 o2 so5 4 so5 hso3 2 so4 so4 2 h 5 so5 hso3 2 so3 hso5 6 so4 hso3 2 so3 so4 2 h 7 cu o2 cu2 o2 in these chain reactions o2 is indispensable for the generation of so4 and so5 in the cu ii s iv system chen et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 as reported in previous studies so4 and so5 are capable of oxidizing organic contaminants for example luo et al found that so5 radicals generated from the cu ii s iv system were the main reactive species for the degradation of n acetyl para aminophenol luo et al 2019 accordingly previous studies assumed that the degradation of organic contaminants by the cu ii s iv systems required the presence of o2 and were fully inhibited in the absence of o2 however we unexpectedly found that a near complete degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was obtained within 60 min at ph 7 under anaerobic conditions while only 20 of the initial dtz was degraded under aerobic conditions the degradation of organic contaminants in cu ii s iv systems under anaerobic conditions has not been noticed so far moreover the main reactive species responsible for the anaerobic degradation of organic contaminants have yet to be identified thus the objectives of this study were 1 to verify the anaerobic degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under various experimental conditions 2 to identify the dominant reactive species accounting for the anaerobic degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system 3 to study the effect of various factors such as cu ii concentration sulfite concentration initial reaction ph bicarbonate chloride and natural organic matter and 4 to assess the possibility of dtz anaerobic degradation by the cu ii s iv system in real water matrices 2 experimental section chemicals diatrizoate sodium dtz c11h8n2o4i3 sodium sulfite na2so3 cupric sulfate cuso4 cobalt sulfate

further purification detailed information about the tap water and surface water samples used in this study was provided in table s1 2 1 diatrizoate degradation experiments all the experiments were conducted in a 500 ml beaker sealed with parafilm the beaker was wrapped with aluminum foil to cut off the light the beaker was placed in a water bath with a thermostat to keep the temperature of solutions constant 25 c throughout the experiments the reaction solution was prepared using pure water spiked with 5 μm diatrizoate the initial ph of the reaction solutions was adjusted to predetermined values by adding h2so4 0 1 mm or naoh 0 1 mm without buffer subsequently experiments were initiated after the introduction of cuso4 na2so3 and diatrizoate into the beaker and mixed with a magnetic stirrer the stirring was stopped after 15 s to minimize the dissolved oxygen in the reaction solutions for thekinetic study of the degradation of dtz samples 1 ml were withdrawn at predetermined intervals and were immediately quenched with 100 μl of na2s2o3 0 2 m then samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane for measurements the experiments involved co ii and fe iii were carried out in a similar manner na2s2o3 has been confirmed as an appropriate quenching agent for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system fig s1 samples were quenched with hydrochloride acid for the measurement of cu i and with ba oh 2 for the determination of iodide all experiments were conducted at least twice and the results represent the mean values with standard deviations analysis

sweep time of 25 s a modulation frequency of 100 khz and a modulation amplitude of 1 0 g 3 results and discussions 3 1 dtz degradation in different processes the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under various oxygen supply conditions was shown in fig 1 these conditions included 1 no aeration in a sealed beaker without continuous stirring cu ii s iv anaerobic 2 no aeration in an open beaker with a continuous stirring cu ii s iv open 3 bubbling pure o2 cu ii s iv o2 and 4 bubbling n2 cu ii s iv n2 throughout the whole experiment at ph 7 approximately 20 of the initial dtz was rapidly eliminated by the cu ii s iv o2 systemwithin the first 5 min of reaction and no more dtz was eliminated until the end of the reactions at 60 min besides the cu ii s iv opensystem degraded53 of the initial dtz in comparison more than 95 of the initial dtz was degraded by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system an appreciable degreeof dtz degradation was also observed in the combination of cu ii with sulfite undern2bubbling cu ii s iv n2 meanwhile dissolved oxygen concentrations were also monitored throughout the experiments under the four different oxygen supply conditions as shown in fig s2 the dissolved oxygen concentration follows the sequence of cu ii s iv o2 cu ii s iv open cu ii s iv anaerobic cu ii s iv n2 the above results indicated that the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was favored under anaerobic conditions at ph 7 the absence of oxygen resulted in high dtz degradation rates in the cu ii s iv n2and cu ii s iv anaerobic systems however literature suggested that the degradation of organic contaminants with transition metals catalyzed sulfite systems can only occurunder aerobic conditions such as bubbling air or oxygen or at least stirring in the open air luo et al 2019 in this work and for the first time a significant degradation of organic contaminants by the transition metal catalyzed sulfite systems under anaerobic conditions was observed moreover the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions has never been investigated before and therefore need to be identified 3 2 mechanisms 3 2 1 role of cu ii or sulfite alone the metal ion easily forms a solid phase at neutral or alkaline ph which will likely adsorbto organic contaminants in aqueous solutions as reported by luo et al cupric hydroxide particles such as cuoh or cu oh 2 were formed in the cu ii s iv system probably at neutral or alkaline ph luo et al 2019 as illustrated in fig s3 cu ii alone degraded dtz negligibly at ph 7 moreover a negligible decline in toc was observedin the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system see fig s4 the above results excluded the adsorption of dtz by cupric hydroxide particles it has also been reported that sulfite alone degraded iodinated haloacetamides via reductive dehalogenation ding et al 2018 however sulfite alone was found to negligibly degrade dtz under anaerobic conditions in this case see fig s3 furthermore it was assumed that the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of dtz were probably generated from the reaction of cu ii with sulfite instead of cu ii or sulfite alone 3 2 2 role of oxysulfur radicals and hydroxyl radicals as reported in the literature oxysulfur radicals sulfate radical so4 and peroxymonosulfate radical so5 and hydroxyl radical oh have been proposed as the main reactive species responsible for contaminant degradation in the metal catalyzed sulfite processes zhao et al 2019 luo et al 2019 thus radical scavenging experiments by adding 100 mm t buoh or meoh were conducted in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system as shown in fig 2 a the percentage of dtz degradation by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system in the presence of 100 mm t buoh and meoh were 94 9 and 95 5 respectively which were quite close to that in the absence of alcohol the results showed that the addition of excessive t buoh or meoh exerted negligible effect on the dtz degradation by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions therefore we can assume that neitherso4 nor oh was the main reactive species involved in the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system as presented in eq 3 so5 canalso be generated by chain reactions in the cu ii s iv o2 system which has been demonstrated to be mainly responsible for the oxidation of certain organic contaminants e g n acetyl para aminophenol due to the relatively low reactivity of meoh with so5 even an excess of meoh could not significantly inhibit the oxidation of organic contaminants by so5 fig s5 shows that meoh dosed at excessively completely inhibited the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv o2 system implying that so5 was inert to dtz moreover oxygen is required for the formation of so5 in the metal catalyzed sulfite processes accordingly the contribution of so5 was also excluded from the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions 3 2 3 role of sulfite radical in the cu ii s v system an internal one electron transfer reaction occurred during the cu ii s iv complexation and producedsulfite radical so3 it should be noted that the generation of so3 does not require the presence of oxygen esr experiments were performed using dmpo as a spin trapping agent in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system as shown in fig s6 an evident signal referring to dmpo so3 spin adduct α n 14 7 g α h 15 9 g was detected in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system confirmingasignificant generation of so3 in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system as reported by deng et al so3 is an active species involved in the degradation ofcertain organic contaminants such as methyl orange deng et al 2017 meaning that so3 might contribute to the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions at ph 7 to verify this assumption the dtz degradation were investigated in both co ii s iv anaerobic and fe iii s iv anaerobic systems wherethe generation of so3 has been demonstrated as shown in fig 2 b the dtz degradation was negligible in both systems besides scavenging experiments were carried out using excessive dmpo and methyl orange asso3 scavengers fig 2 a showed that both scavengers did not affect the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system thus we can assume that so3 was not the major reactive species responsible for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions 3 2 4 role of cu i according to the literature cu i was produced via the decomposition of the cuso3 complex in the radical chain reactions of the cu ii s iv system in addition cu i formation was confirmed in the cu ii s iv under anaerobic conditions see fig 3 a more importantly cu i has been reported to be a strong reducing agent for the dehalogenation of halogenated organic contaminants nozaki et al 1969 cohen and cristea 1975 thus the role of cu i in the dtz degradation under anaerobic conditions was investigated in this study as shown in fig 3 b cu i added as cucl as it is commercially available effectively degraded dtz more than 80 of initial dtz and the degradation was accompanied by the release of iodide ion in the reaction time of 60 min under n2 purge due to its relatively low solubility only a fraction of cucl was dissolved in the experimental solution resulting in a lower degradation of dtz than in the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions these findings confirmed that cu i is capable of degrading dtz under anaerobic conditions to further confirm the role of cu i in the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions a further test with an additional concentration of neocuproine 0 5 mm as a specific cu i chelating agent was conducted neocuproine is readily coordinated with cu i to form a yellow complex which is a much weaker ligand for cu ii moffett et al 1985 the complex of neocuproine with cu i is quite stable and our control test showed that it cannot degrade dtz as shown in fig 2 a neocuproine fully inhibited the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions notably an occurrence of a yellow complex was observed when adding neocuproine in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system the yellow complex was considered to be the complex of cu i with neocuproine the above results indicated that cu i was probably the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions and the inhibited degradation of dtz under aerobic condition at ph 7 was mainly ascribed to the oxidation of the formed cu i by oxygen 3 3 transformation products as shown in fig 4 a positive linear relationship was observed between the degraded dtz concentration δ dtz and the formed iodide concentration δ i this result suggested that the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system mainly occurred via deiodination which was also observed in other reductive processes when treating dtz el athman et al 2019 in addition the concentration of iodide formed was 1 529 times higher than the concentration of dtz degraded δ i 1 529 δ dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system due to the fact that dtz contains 3 iodine substituents bonded to the central aromatic rings a complete deiodination would result in a concentration of the degraded dtz 3 times higher than the iodide formed concentration δ i 3 δ dtz thus we can assume that the deiodination occurred partially in the degradation of dtz furthermore organic transformation products of dtz generated by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system were also identified by uplc ms as illustrated in fig s7 fig s8 and table s2 their structures have been tentatively proposed based on the analysis of the total ion chromatograms and corresponding mass spectra obtained by positive ion electrospray deiodinated products were detected indicating that the degradation of dtz mainly occurred by deiodination 3 4 influencing factors 3 4 1 effect of cu ii and s iv concentrations to investigate the effect of cu ii on the degradation of dtz different cu ii concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 μmwere added to the solution in the presence ofa fixed concentration of s iv 2 mm as shown in fig 5 a the degradation of dtz increased from 37 9 to 90 9 with the increase in cu ii concentration from 10 to 50 μm after 60 minutes of reaction when the concentration of cu ii later increased from 50 to 500 μm the degradation of dtz reached more than 95 and remained nearly stable fig 5 b shows the variations of the cu i and iodide ion formed in presence of cu ii ranging from 10 to 200 μm nearly all the cu ii was reduced to cu i when the cu ii concentration increased to 500 μm the cu i formed also increased to approximately 300 μm thus it was assumed that the concentration of cu i was positively correlated with the degree of dtz degradation which supported the essential role of cu i in the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions it should be noted that the formed iodide ion also increased from 1 1 to 7 0 μm with the increase of cu ii concentration from 10 to 500 μm the trend of iodide ion variation was also positively correlated with the formed cu i this result implied that the degradation of dtz by cu i resulted in the release of iodide ion fig 6 a shows the effect of s iv concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 4 mm on the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system in presence of a fixed concentration of cu ii 0 1 mm at ph 7 the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system after 60 min of reaction increased from 8 8 to 96 4 with the increase of s iv concentration from 0 5 to 2 mm and remained nearly stable when the concentration of s iv ranged from 2 to 4 mm these findings can be ascribed to the cu i formed in the cu ii s iv system with various concentrations of s iv which exhibited a similar trend to the degradation of dtz by cu ii s iv system after 60 min of reaction see fig 5 b for example the concentration of cu i formed increased from 5 2 to 94 8 μm with the increase of s iv concentration from 0 5 to 2 mm a further increase in the concentration of s iv from 2 to 4 mm resulted in a negligible increase in the concentration of cu i formed from 94 8 to 95 7 μm it should be noted that the iodide formed shared the similar trend with the cu i formed the concentration of the iodide ion released increased from 0 to 7 0 μm whenthe concentration of s iv increased from 0 5 to 2 mm then it increased slightly to 7 1 μm when s iv concentration later increased to 4 mm 3 4 2 effect of solution ph the ph of the solution is an important factor influencing the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system as shown in fig 7 a the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system increased from 29 3 to 97 7 as ph increased from 3 0 to 6 0 and decreased to 8 3 as ph later increased to 10 0 indicating that the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was favored at neutral ph ph 6 0 7 0 under anaerobic conditions but was inhibited at strongly acidic or alkaline ph however chen et al reported that the cu ii s iv system exhibited the best performance on the degradation of organic contaminants at alkaline ph in the presence of oxygen chen et al 2018 the different trend of degradation performance as a function of ph reconfirmed the different reactive species involved in the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system in the absence presence of oxygen because cu i has been confirmed as the main reactive species in the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions the cu i formed was monitored at various phs as shown in fig 7 b the concentration of cu i showed an increase when the ph of the solution increased from 3 0 to 7 0 followed by a decrease when the ph of the solutionlater increased to 10 0 the cu i formed shared the similar ph dependent trend with the degradation of dtz in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system according to eq 2 cu i was generated from the decomposition of the cuso3 complex after an inner electron transfer reaction it should be noted that the formation of the cuso3 complex is also strongly ph dependent as reported by luo et al the cuso3 complex is mainly formed at ph 6 7 luo et al 2019 which resulted in a higher concentration of cu i formed and thus a higher degradation of dtz at neutral ph it was also found that the concentration of released iodide increased from 1 83 μm to 7 64 μm when the ph of the solution increased from 3 0 to 7 0 then decreased to 0 59 μm when the ph of the solution later increased to 10 0 the ph dependent trend of the iodide release was also consistent with that of cu i formation meanwhile it was noticed that the ph of the solution remained almost stable when the cu ii s iv reaction proceeded under anaerobic conditions see fig s9 on the other hand in the literature the ph of the solution decreased rapidly in the s iv auto oxidation catalyzed by transition metals including cu ii under aerobic conditions chen et al 2018 the depression of ph might be attributed to the generation of protons from the oxidation of bisulfite as eq 4 and eq 6 3 4 3 effect of temperature fig 8 a shows the effect of temperature on the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system an obvious enhanced degradation of dtz was observed by raising the reaction temperature from 10 c to 30 c for example in the cu ii s iv system only 24 1 of the initial dtz were degraded within 60 min at 10 c while all the initial dtz were degraded within 40 min at 30 c as shown in fig 8 b lnk obs exhibited a linear relationship with 1 t suggesting that the temperature dependent rate constants k obs followed the arrhenius law as expressed in eq 8 8 lnk obs lna ea rt where a is the pre exponential factor ea is the apparent activation energy for the degradation of dtz r is the molar gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the solution temperature based on the arrhenius equation the apparent activation energy ea for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was calculated and a value of 119 4 kj mol was obtained as shown infig s10 a positive correlation between the formed cu i and temperature was observed in the cu ii s iv system the released iodide ion also increased with the increasing temperature thus the enhanced degradation of dtz with the increasing temperature was probably ascribed to the increased formation of cu i from the reaction of cu ii with s iv as well as the higher reaction rate between cu i and dtz at higher temperature 3 4 4 effect of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid due to their universal existence the effects of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid on the degradation of organic contaminants were typically investigated in various other systems as shown in fig 9 a b and c each of the three components showed a negligible inhibiting effect on the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system the degradation of dtz achieved more than 97 regardless of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid concentrations the corresponding released iodide ion was nearly stable in the applied range of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid data not shown the concentrations of the released iodide ion were determined to be 6 9 7 1 μm this phenomenon has probably been attributed to the fact that theformation of cu i in the cu ii s iv systems has not been affected by the addition of different concentrations of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid as fig s11 indeed the concentrations of the cu i formed reached more than 94 μm regardless of the concentrations of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid which accounted for over 94 of the initial applied cu ii 3 5 dtz degradation by the cu ii s iv system in real water background the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system in two real water matrices was evaluated as shown in fig 9 d almost all of the initial dose of dtz was eliminated in the two real water matrices by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions although different natural organic matter and inorganic compounds were present in the two real water samples the degradation rates of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system in the real water samples and the synthetic water samples were similar confirming again that the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system was relatively inert to the influences of water matrices therefore the cu ii s iv anaerobic system is a promising option for dtz degradation 4 conclusion in this study a near complete degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was achieved at ph 7 under anaerobic conditions dissolved oxygen which is necessary in the metal catalyzed sulfite oxidation processes as reported previously was surprisingly found to remarkably inhibit the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system at ph 7 cu i was found to be the crucial reactive species responsible for the anaerobic degradation of dtz the released iodide ion and deiodinated products detected indicated that deiodination is probably the main degradation pathway of dtz it should be noted that the anaerobic degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was slightly influenced by the co existence of chloride ion bicarbonate and humic acid the high efficiency of dtz degradation in real water samples suggested the feasibility of the cu ii s iv anaerobic system in real practices admittedly the cu ii s iv anaerobic system has a high selectivity in the degradation of organic contaminants further efforts are required to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of the cu ii s iv anaerobic system in the degradation of organic contaminants with diverse structures in addition the cu ii s iv system has been reported to be effective in inactivating bacteria and coliforms especially under anaerobic conditions chen et al 2017 the concomitant performance of the cu ii s iv anaerobic system on the degradation of organic contaminants and disinfection

17007,transition metal catalyzed sulfite auto oxidation is a promising technology used in water and wastewater treatment for the elimination of contaminants in the literature this process has been reported to be efficient only in the presence of oxygen however in this study we unexpectedly found that the degradation of diatrizoate dtz by a system based on the combination of copper ion and sulfite cu ii s iv reached over 95 under anaerobic conditions but was considerably retarded under aerobic conditions at ph 7 furthermore it was found that cu i generated from the cleavage of the cuso3 complex was the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions in fact the absence of oxygen promoted the accumulation of cu i the concomitant release of the iodide ion with the degradation of dtz indicated that the anaerobic degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system mainly proceeded through the deiodination pathway which was also confirmed by the detection of deiodinated products the anaerobic degradation of dtz was favored at higher initial concentrations of cu ii or sulfite in this system since the cuso3 complex the precursor of cu i was formed mainly at ph 7 the highest anaerobic degradation of dtz was achieved at ph 7 an increase in reaction temperature considerably enhanced the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system with an apparent activation energy of 119 4 kj mol the presence of chloride bicarbonate and humic acid slightly influenced the anaerobic degradation of dtz the experiments with real water samples also demonstrated the effectiveness of the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic degradation copper sulfite deiodination cu i diatrizoate 1 introduction diatrizoate dtz an iodinated contrast media compound is generally used as a medical diagnostic agent for tissue and organ imaging christiansen 2005 it can be excreted unchanged within 24 hours after each patient has taken with a large quantity 100 g dose 1 it has been reported that dtz may pose a nephrotoxic threat to humans and animals gale et al 1984 moreover iodinated contrast media compounds including dtz contribute substantially to absorbable organic halogen aox in hospital wastewater which is considered to have a potential health impact duirk et al 2011 accordingly it is required to eliminate dtz from water dtz which is chemically inert and resistant to conventional wastewater and drinking water treatments will thus be released into the environment ribbers et al 2019 redeker et al 2014 in fact dtz has been detected in wastewater surface water groundwater and even in finish drinking waters at concentrations ranging from ng l to μg l kovalova et al 2012 kormos et al 2011 w seitz et al 2006 ternes and hirsch 2000 several advanced oxidation processes aops have been studied for the degradation of dtz such as ozonation ternes et al 2003 w seitz et al 2006 fenton real et al 2009 uv fenton velo gala et al 2014 zero valent iron stieber et al 2011 chlorination ye et al 2014 uv chlorination hu et al 2019 wu et al 2019 photo activated persulfate zhou et al 2017 and sulfate mediated electrooxidation processes radjenovic and petrovic 2016 recently bi sulfite auto oxidation catalyzed by transition metals has been increasingly studied for the generation of so4 guo et al 2013 chen et al 2012 chen et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 compared to persulfate ps and peroxymonosulfate pms bi sulfite is a precursor of so4 more cost effective with less chronic toxicity wu et al 2021 xie et al 2019 zhou et al 2018 thus transition metal catalyzed sulfite auto oxidation systems me s iv are considered a promising process for the elimination of organic contaminants du et al 2018 xie et al 2017 among the various transition metals cu ii has proven to be an effective catalyst for the activation of sulfite auto oxidation over a wide ph range luo et al 2019 chen et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 moreover cu ii s iv system has a higher electron spin resonance esr signal than fe ii s iv co ii s iv and mn ii o2 s iv systems chen et al 2017 in the cu ii s iv system cu ii initially form a complex with sulfite as described in eq 1 conklin and hoffmann 1988 then the cuso3 complex decomposes into cu i and so3 after an inner electron transfer reaction as expressed in eq 2 in the presence of o2 so3 is oxidized to so5 which then reacts with hso3 to generate so4 as eqs 3 4 besides both so5 and so4 can also react with hso3 to be reconverted to so3 see eq 5 6 meanwhile the cu formed is again oxidized to cu2 by o2 as described in eq 7 1 cu2 so3 2 cuso3 2 cuso3 cu so3 3 so3 o2 so5 4 so5 hso3 2 so4 so4 2 h 5 so5 hso3 2 so3 hso5 6 so4 hso3 2 so3 so4 2 h 7 cu o2 cu2 o2 in these chain reactions o2 is indispensable for the generation of so4 and so5 in the cu ii s iv system chen et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 as reported in previous studies so4 and so5 are capable of oxidizing organic contaminants for example luo et al found that so5 radicals generated from the cu ii s iv system were the main reactive species for the degradation of n acetyl para aminophenol luo et al 2019 accordingly previous studies assumed that the degradation of organic contaminants by the cu ii s iv systems required the presence of o2 and were fully inhibited in the absence of o2 however we unexpectedly found that a near complete degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was obtained within 60 min at ph 7 under anaerobic conditions while only 20 of the initial dtz was degraded under aerobic conditions the degradation of organic contaminants in cu ii s iv systems under anaerobic conditions has not been noticed so far moreover the main reactive species responsible for the anaerobic degradation of organic contaminants have yet to be identified thus the objectives of this study were 1 to verify the anaerobic degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under various experimental conditions 2 to identify the dominant reactive species accounting for the anaerobic degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system 3 to study the effect of various factors such as cu ii concentration sulfite concentration initial reaction ph bicarbonate chloride and natural organic matter and 4 to assess the possibility of dtz anaerobic degradation by the cu ii s iv system in real water matrices 2 experimental section chemicals diatrizoate sodium dtz c11h8n2o4i3 sodium sulfite na2so3 cupric sulfate cuso4 cobalt sulfate

further purification detailed information about the tap water and surface water samples used in this study was provided in table s1 2 1 diatrizoate degradation experiments all the experiments were conducted in a 500 ml beaker sealed with parafilm the beaker was wrapped with aluminum foil to cut off the light the beaker was placed in a water bath with a thermostat to keep the temperature of solutions constant 25 c throughout the experiments the reaction solution was prepared using pure water spiked with 5 μm diatrizoate the initial ph of the reaction solutions was adjusted to predetermined values by adding h2so4 0 1 mm or naoh 0 1 mm without buffer subsequently experiments were initiated after the introduction of cuso4 na2so3 and diatrizoate into the beaker and mixed with a magnetic stirrer the stirring was stopped after 15 s to minimize the dissolved oxygen in the reaction solutions for thekinetic study of the degradation of dtz samples 1 ml were withdrawn at predetermined intervals and were immediately quenched with 100 μl of na2s2o3 0 2 m then samples were filtered through a 0 22 μm membrane for measurements the experiments involved co ii and fe iii were carried out in a similar manner na2s2o3 has been confirmed as an appropriate quenching agent for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system fig s1 samples were quenched with hydrochloride acid for the measurement of cu i and with ba oh 2 for the determination of iodide all experiments were conducted at least twice and the results represent the mean values with standard deviations analysis

sweep time of 25 s a modulation frequency of 100 khz and a modulation amplitude of 1 0 g 3 results and discussions 3 1 dtz degradation in different processes the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under various oxygen supply conditions was shown in fig 1 these conditions included 1 no aeration in a sealed beaker without continuous stirring cu ii s iv anaerobic 2 no aeration in an open beaker with a continuous stirring cu ii s iv open 3 bubbling pure o2 cu ii s iv o2 and 4 bubbling n2 cu ii s iv n2 throughout the whole experiment at ph 7 approximately 20 of the initial dtz was rapidly eliminated by the cu ii s iv o2 systemwithin the first 5 min of reaction and no more dtz was eliminated until the end of the reactions at 60 min besides the cu ii s iv opensystem degraded53 of the initial dtz in comparison more than 95 of the initial dtz was degraded by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system an appreciable degreeof dtz degradation was also observed in the combination of cu ii with sulfite undern2bubbling cu ii s iv n2 meanwhile dissolved oxygen concentrations were also monitored throughout the experiments under the four different oxygen supply conditions as shown in fig s2 the dissolved oxygen concentration follows the sequence of cu ii s iv o2 cu ii s iv open cu ii s iv anaerobic cu ii s iv n2 the above results indicated that the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was favored under anaerobic conditions at ph 7 the absence of oxygen resulted in high dtz degradation rates in the cu ii s iv n2and cu ii s iv anaerobic systems however literature suggested that the degradation of organic contaminants with transition metals catalyzed sulfite systems can only occurunder aerobic conditions such as bubbling air or oxygen or at least stirring in the open air luo et al 2019 in this work and for the first time a significant degradation of organic contaminants by the transition metal catalyzed sulfite systems under anaerobic conditions was observed moreover the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions has never been investigated before and therefore need to be identified 3 2 mechanisms 3 2 1 role of cu ii or sulfite alone the metal ion easily forms a solid phase at neutral or alkaline ph which will likely adsorbto organic contaminants in aqueous solutions as reported by luo et al cupric hydroxide particles such as cuoh or cu oh 2 were formed in the cu ii s iv system probably at neutral or alkaline ph luo et al 2019 as illustrated in fig s3 cu ii alone degraded dtz negligibly at ph 7 moreover a negligible decline in toc was observedin the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system see fig s4 the above results excluded the adsorption of dtz by cupric hydroxide particles it has also been reported that sulfite alone degraded iodinated haloacetamides via reductive dehalogenation ding et al 2018 however sulfite alone was found to negligibly degrade dtz under anaerobic conditions in this case see fig s3 furthermore it was assumed that the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of dtz were probably generated from the reaction of cu ii with sulfite instead of cu ii or sulfite alone 3 2 2 role of oxysulfur radicals and hydroxyl radicals as reported in the literature oxysulfur radicals sulfate radical so4 and peroxymonosulfate radical so5 and hydroxyl radical oh have been proposed as the main reactive species responsible for contaminant degradation in the metal catalyzed sulfite processes zhao et al 2019 luo et al 2019 thus radical scavenging experiments by adding 100 mm t buoh or meoh were conducted in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system as shown in fig 2 a the percentage of dtz degradation by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system in the presence of 100 mm t buoh and meoh were 94 9 and 95 5 respectively which were quite close to that in the absence of alcohol the results showed that the addition of excessive t buoh or meoh exerted negligible effect on the dtz degradation by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions therefore we can assume that neitherso4 nor oh was the main reactive species involved in the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system as presented in eq 3 so5 canalso be generated by chain reactions in the cu ii s iv o2 system which has been demonstrated to be mainly responsible for the oxidation of certain organic contaminants e g n acetyl para aminophenol due to the relatively low reactivity of meoh with so5 even an excess of meoh could not significantly inhibit the oxidation of organic contaminants by so5 fig s5 shows that meoh dosed at excessively completely inhibited the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv o2 system implying that so5 was inert to dtz moreover oxygen is required for the formation of so5 in the metal catalyzed sulfite processes accordingly the contribution of so5 was also excluded from the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions 3 2 3 role of sulfite radical in the cu ii s v system an internal one electron transfer reaction occurred during the cu ii s iv complexation and producedsulfite radical so3 it should be noted that the generation of so3 does not require the presence of oxygen esr experiments were performed using dmpo as a spin trapping agent in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system as shown in fig s6 an evident signal referring to dmpo so3 spin adduct α n 14 7 g α h 15 9 g was detected in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system confirmingasignificant generation of so3 in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system as reported by deng et al so3 is an active species involved in the degradation ofcertain organic contaminants such as methyl orange deng et al 2017 meaning that so3 might contribute to the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions at ph 7 to verify this assumption the dtz degradation were investigated in both co ii s iv anaerobic and fe iii s iv anaerobic systems wherethe generation of so3 has been demonstrated as shown in fig 2 b the dtz degradation was negligible in both systems besides scavenging experiments were carried out using excessive dmpo and methyl orange asso3 scavengers fig 2 a showed that both scavengers did not affect the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system thus we can assume that so3 was not the major reactive species responsible for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions 3 2 4 role of cu i according to the literature cu i was produced via the decomposition of the cuso3 complex in the radical chain reactions of the cu ii s iv system in addition cu i formation was confirmed in the cu ii s iv under anaerobic conditions see fig 3 a more importantly cu i has been reported to be a strong reducing agent for the dehalogenation of halogenated organic contaminants nozaki et al 1969 cohen and cristea 1975 thus the role of cu i in the dtz degradation under anaerobic conditions was investigated in this study as shown in fig 3 b cu i added as cucl as it is commercially available effectively degraded dtz more than 80 of initial dtz and the degradation was accompanied by the release of iodide ion in the reaction time of 60 min under n2 purge due to its relatively low solubility only a fraction of cucl was dissolved in the experimental solution resulting in a lower degradation of dtz than in the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions these findings confirmed that cu i is capable of degrading dtz under anaerobic conditions to further confirm the role of cu i in the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions a further test with an additional concentration of neocuproine 0 5 mm as a specific cu i chelating agent was conducted neocuproine is readily coordinated with cu i to form a yellow complex which is a much weaker ligand for cu ii moffett et al 1985 the complex of neocuproine with cu i is quite stable and our control test showed that it cannot degrade dtz as shown in fig 2 a neocuproine fully inhibited the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions notably an occurrence of a yellow complex was observed when adding neocuproine in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system the yellow complex was considered to be the complex of cu i with neocuproine the above results indicated that cu i was probably the main reactive species responsible for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions and the inhibited degradation of dtz under aerobic condition at ph 7 was mainly ascribed to the oxidation of the formed cu i by oxygen 3 3 transformation products as shown in fig 4 a positive linear relationship was observed between the degraded dtz concentration δ dtz and the formed iodide concentration δ i this result suggested that the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system mainly occurred via deiodination which was also observed in other reductive processes when treating dtz el athman et al 2019 in addition the concentration of iodide formed was 1 529 times higher than the concentration of dtz degraded δ i 1 529 δ dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system due to the fact that dtz contains 3 iodine substituents bonded to the central aromatic rings a complete deiodination would result in a concentration of the degraded dtz 3 times higher than the iodide formed concentration δ i 3 δ dtz thus we can assume that the deiodination occurred partially in the degradation of dtz furthermore organic transformation products of dtz generated by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system were also identified by uplc ms as illustrated in fig s7 fig s8 and table s2 their structures have been tentatively proposed based on the analysis of the total ion chromatograms and corresponding mass spectra obtained by positive ion electrospray deiodinated products were detected indicating that the degradation of dtz mainly occurred by deiodination 3 4 influencing factors 3 4 1 effect of cu ii and s iv concentrations to investigate the effect of cu ii on the degradation of dtz different cu ii concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 μmwere added to the solution in the presence ofa fixed concentration of s iv 2 mm as shown in fig 5 a the degradation of dtz increased from 37 9 to 90 9 with the increase in cu ii concentration from 10 to 50 μm after 60 minutes of reaction when the concentration of cu ii later increased from 50 to 500 μm the degradation of dtz reached more than 95 and remained nearly stable fig 5 b shows the variations of the cu i and iodide ion formed in presence of cu ii ranging from 10 to 200 μm nearly all the cu ii was reduced to cu i when the cu ii concentration increased to 500 μm the cu i formed also increased to approximately 300 μm thus it was assumed that the concentration of cu i was positively correlated with the degree of dtz degradation which supported the essential role of cu i in the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions it should be noted that the formed iodide ion also increased from 1 1 to 7 0 μm with the increase of cu ii concentration from 10 to 500 μm the trend of iodide ion variation was also positively correlated with the formed cu i this result implied that the degradation of dtz by cu i resulted in the release of iodide ion fig 6 a shows the effect of s iv concentrations ranging from 0 5 to 4 mm on the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system in presence of a fixed concentration of cu ii 0 1 mm at ph 7 the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system after 60 min of reaction increased from 8 8 to 96 4 with the increase of s iv concentration from 0 5 to 2 mm and remained nearly stable when the concentration of s iv ranged from 2 to 4 mm these findings can be ascribed to the cu i formed in the cu ii s iv system with various concentrations of s iv which exhibited a similar trend to the degradation of dtz by cu ii s iv system after 60 min of reaction see fig 5 b for example the concentration of cu i formed increased from 5 2 to 94 8 μm with the increase of s iv concentration from 0 5 to 2 mm a further increase in the concentration of s iv from 2 to 4 mm resulted in a negligible increase in the concentration of cu i formed from 94 8 to 95 7 μm it should be noted that the iodide formed shared the similar trend with the cu i formed the concentration of the iodide ion released increased from 0 to 7 0 μm whenthe concentration of s iv increased from 0 5 to 2 mm then it increased slightly to 7 1 μm when s iv concentration later increased to 4 mm 3 4 2 effect of solution ph the ph of the solution is an important factor influencing the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system as shown in fig 7 a the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system increased from 29 3 to 97 7 as ph increased from 3 0 to 6 0 and decreased to 8 3 as ph later increased to 10 0 indicating that the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was favored at neutral ph ph 6 0 7 0 under anaerobic conditions but was inhibited at strongly acidic or alkaline ph however chen et al reported that the cu ii s iv system exhibited the best performance on the degradation of organic contaminants at alkaline ph in the presence of oxygen chen et al 2018 the different trend of degradation performance as a function of ph reconfirmed the different reactive species involved in the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system in the absence presence of oxygen because cu i has been confirmed as the main reactive species in the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions the cu i formed was monitored at various phs as shown in fig 7 b the concentration of cu i showed an increase when the ph of the solution increased from 3 0 to 7 0 followed by a decrease when the ph of the solutionlater increased to 10 0 the cu i formed shared the similar ph dependent trend with the degradation of dtz in the cu ii s iv anaerobic system according to eq 2 cu i was generated from the decomposition of the cuso3 complex after an inner electron transfer reaction it should be noted that the formation of the cuso3 complex is also strongly ph dependent as reported by luo et al the cuso3 complex is mainly formed at ph 6 7 luo et al 2019 which resulted in a higher concentration of cu i formed and thus a higher degradation of dtz at neutral ph it was also found that the concentration of released iodide increased from 1 83 μm to 7 64 μm when the ph of the solution increased from 3 0 to 7 0 then decreased to 0 59 μm when the ph of the solution later increased to 10 0 the ph dependent trend of the iodide release was also consistent with that of cu i formation meanwhile it was noticed that the ph of the solution remained almost stable when the cu ii s iv reaction proceeded under anaerobic conditions see fig s9 on the other hand in the literature the ph of the solution decreased rapidly in the s iv auto oxidation catalyzed by transition metals including cu ii under aerobic conditions chen et al 2018 the depression of ph might be attributed to the generation of protons from the oxidation of bisulfite as eq 4 and eq 6 3 4 3 effect of temperature fig 8 a shows the effect of temperature on the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system an obvious enhanced degradation of dtz was observed by raising the reaction temperature from 10 c to 30 c for example in the cu ii s iv system only 24 1 of the initial dtz were degraded within 60 min at 10 c while all the initial dtz were degraded within 40 min at 30 c as shown in fig 8 b lnk obs exhibited a linear relationship with 1 t suggesting that the temperature dependent rate constants k obs followed the arrhenius law as expressed in eq 8 8 lnk obs lna ea rt where a is the pre exponential factor ea is the apparent activation energy for the degradation of dtz r is the molar gas constant 8 314 j mol k and t is the solution temperature based on the arrhenius equation the apparent activation energy ea for the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was calculated and a value of 119 4 kj mol was obtained as shown infig s10 a positive correlation between the formed cu i and temperature was observed in the cu ii s iv system the released iodide ion also increased with the increasing temperature thus the enhanced degradation of dtz with the increasing temperature was probably ascribed to the increased formation of cu i from the reaction of cu ii with s iv as well as the higher reaction rate between cu i and dtz at higher temperature 3 4 4 effect of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid due to their universal existence the effects of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid on the degradation of organic contaminants were typically investigated in various other systems as shown in fig 9 a b and c each of the three components showed a negligible inhibiting effect on the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system the degradation of dtz achieved more than 97 regardless of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid concentrations the corresponding released iodide ion was nearly stable in the applied range of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid data not shown the concentrations of the released iodide ion were determined to be 6 9 7 1 μm this phenomenon has probably been attributed to the fact that theformation of cu i in the cu ii s iv systems has not been affected by the addition of different concentrations of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid as fig s11 indeed the concentrations of the cu i formed reached more than 94 μm regardless of the concentrations of bicarbonate chloride and humic acid which accounted for over 94 of the initial applied cu ii 3 5 dtz degradation by the cu ii s iv system in real water background the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system in two real water matrices was evaluated as shown in fig 9 d almost all of the initial dose of dtz was eliminated in the two real water matrices by the cu ii s iv system under anaerobic conditions although different natural organic matter and inorganic compounds were present in the two real water samples the degradation rates of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system in the real water samples and the synthetic water samples were similar confirming again that the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv anaerobic system was relatively inert to the influences of water matrices therefore the cu ii s iv anaerobic system is a promising option for dtz degradation 4 conclusion in this study a near complete degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was achieved at ph 7 under anaerobic conditions dissolved oxygen which is necessary in the metal catalyzed sulfite oxidation processes as reported previously was surprisingly found to remarkably inhibit the degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system at ph 7 cu i was found to be the crucial reactive species responsible for the anaerobic degradation of dtz the released iodide ion and deiodinated products detected indicated that deiodination is probably the main degradation pathway of dtz it should be noted that the anaerobic degradation of dtz by the cu ii s iv system was slightly influenced by the co existence of chloride ion bicarbonate and humic acid the high efficiency of dtz degradation in real water samples suggested the feasibility of the cu ii s iv anaerobic system in real practices admittedly the cu ii s iv anaerobic system has a high selectivity in the degradation of organic contaminants further efforts are required to investigate the kinetics and mechanisms of the cu ii s iv anaerobic system in the degradation of organic contaminants with diverse structures in addition the cu ii s iv system has been reported to be effective in inactivating bacteria and coliforms especially under anaerobic conditions chen et al 2017 the concomitant performance of the cu ii s iv anaerobic system on the degradation of organic contaminants and disinfection

17008,perfluoroalkyl substances pfass can occur in water sources pass through drinking water treatment plants dwtps drinking water distribution systems dwdss to the consumer taps this investigation was carried out to present the transportation behaviors of 17 pfass involving seven dwtps with different water sources raw water transportation modes treatment processes and dwds structures in eastern and northern china the results showed that the long distance raw water transportation pipelines removed a certain extent of pfass from raw water probably due to the accumulation of loose deposits the long distance open channel south to north water diversion increased pfas contamination risk in the dwtps granular activated carbon gac adsorption and ultraviolet radiation removed less than 25 of pfass but ozonation biological activated carbon o3 bac was superior to gac alone in removing pfass loose deposits couldsignificantly influence pfas accumulation and release within branch structured dwdss in loop structured dwdss finished water with different pfas characteristics could mix along the pipeline with the corresponding dwtp as the center ultimately forming a relatively uniform distribution in the entire dwds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluoroalkyl substance raw water transportation mode drinking water treatment process drinking water distribution system transportation characteristics 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a group of anthropogenic environmental pollutants and are used extensively as additives in food packaging firefighting foams and surface treatment agents for textiles rahman et al 2014 these uses derive from the unique properties of pfass including high thermal and chemical stability surface activity and hydrooleophobicity pfass are typically found in rivers sun et al 2016 soil outdoor dust yao et al 2016 and even human plasma poothong et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 and bones koskela et al 2017 multiple studies have reported a significant correlation between pfas concentrations in drinking water and blood zhang et al 2019 and pfass have been frequently detected in drinking water which is one major pathway for human exposure to pfass the u s environmental protection agency usepa third unregulated contaminant monitoring rule database showed 40 of the drinking water pfas concentrations 2013 2015 exceeding the usepa health advisory of 70 ng l for individual or combined perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos usepa 2016 concentrations in public water supplies hurley et al 2016 the detection frequencies of short chain pfass in drinking water of many countries including canada france and japan were within the range of 64 92 2015 2016 kaboré et al 2018 in china the mean of the sum concentrations of the 17 pfass was 35 13 ng l 4 49 174 93 ng l 2017 li et al 2019b and pfass in drinking water of eastern china were relatively higher than those in other regions chen et al 2019 once the source water is contaminated with pfass it will directly affect drinking water quality previous studies reported that pfas concentrations in drinking water around fluorochemical manufacturing parks jin et al 2015 and fire training areas hu et al 2016 were significantly higher than those in other areas to obtain a sufficient or higher quality water source according to their own location conditions drinking water treatment plants dwtps need to choose different water transportation modes a dwtp located next to its water source can collect water directly dwtps far from the water source must use water transportation pipelines xu et al 2020 even by aid of open channels and rivers to obtain raw water over long distances an example of the latter is taihu lake a large scale water source that supplies raw water to multiple cities through water transportation pipelines xu et al 2018 the south to north water diversion project snwdp in china is by far the largest interbasin water transfer project in the world south water provided 73 of drinking water to beijing an important water receiving area through the middle route of the snwdp over a distance of 1276 km in addition when raw water cannot provide a sufficient water supply dwtps will adopt a mixed water transportation mode of multiple raw water sources however few studies have focused on the risk of pfas pollution caused by different types of raw water and water transportation modes the treatment process of dwtps has difficulty purifying pfas contaminated water sources previous studies have shown that coagulation sedimentation filtration chlorine disinfection and other conventional processes have very limited effectiveness on pfas removal xiao et al 2013 granular activated carbon gac is considered to be effective for pfas treatment in dwtps glover et al 2018 however the treatment effect of gac gradually disappeared as carbon ages increased and possible desorption of pfass might occur watanabe et al 2011 the phenomenon that the effluent concentration is higher than the influent concentration is called the chromatographic effect hand et al 1997 park et al 2020 activated carbon pore characteristics and changing influent composition can affect the desorption behavior of contaminants aschermann et al 2019 2018 in recent years many dwtps have gradually upgraded their treatment processes with ozone uv ultrafiltration etc although these processes have proven unsatisfactory for pfas removal in some laboratory studies however there are relatively few investigations on the performance of pfas treatment by advanced treatment processes in full scale dwtps in addition to examining the removal effect it is also important to evaluate the potential risks associated with the treatment process a drinking water distribution system dwds is key to ensuring drinking water safety and the deterioration of water quality often occurs in dwdss cerrato et al 2006 kim et al 2011 li et al 2019a the dwds environment will affect the transport behavior of pfass it has been reported that pfass especially long chain pfass would accumulate by loose deposits on the pipe wall thus showing a downward trend of concentration during the distribution process chen et al 2019 water quality variation can also become an important factor affecting the distribution of pfass in dwdss chen et al 2021 although there are few studies focused on this issue the structure of a dwds is usually divided into branched pipeline and looped pipe networks the branched pipeline is used mostly for small scale township water supply the structure has the characteristics of long pipelines small population low water consumption and long hydraulic retention time ma et al 2019 yu et al 2019 correspondingly the accumulation of loose deposits is more likely to occur in branched pipelines the looped pipe network is used mostly in urban water supply with a large coverage area where the population is concentrated and the water consumption is high li et al 2011 therefore the looped pipe network has better hydraulic conditions and more uniform water quality at present there are few studies comparing the transport behavior of pfass in different types of actual dwdss this study was motivated to better understand the fate of pfass from water sources to dwtps and further to dwdss seven water supply systems located in eastern and northern china were selected to compare 1 the possible impact of different raw water and water transportation modes on pfas compositions and concentrations 2 the efficiency of pfas removal in different dwtp treatment processes and 3 the pfas transportation characteristics in branched pipe networks versus looped pipe networks the results from this study can provide a reference and guidance for identifying and monitoring pfas risks from water sources to tap water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a total of 17 pfass 13 pfcas 4 pfsas were selected for investigation with their names listed in text 1 of the supplementary material native standards and mass labeled internal standards were purchased from wellington laboratories ontario canada high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade methanol and acetonitrile were purchased from fisher scientific ottawa canada hplc grade ammonium acetate 99 0 ammonium hydroxide solutions 25 in h2o and acetic acid 99 were purchased from aladdin co shanghai china 2 2 study sites and sample collection a total of 115 water samples 8 raw water 38 dwtp treatment process water and 77 dwds water samples from seven dwtps dwtps 1 7 were collected from july 2018 to october 2019 from different areas of china fig s1 dwtp 1 is located in area a this area uses approximately 22 km of raw water transportation pipelines to convey water from taihu lake to dwtp 1 and supplies water to local towns through branched pipe networks dwtp 2 located in area b obtains raw water directly from adjacent luoma lake and uses branched pipe networks to supply drinking water dwtps 3 5 located in area c use south water from the middle route of the snwdp as their raw water after south water enters area c the water travels to dwtp 3 through the southern canal and to dwtp 4 and 5 after passing through a regulation pool dwtp 6 uses mixed raw water from south water and local groundwater dwtp 7 uses groundwater as raw water different from groundwater of dwtp 6 dwtps 3 7 jointly supply drinking water for area c through a looped pipe network the information including name location source water type and water treatment process of the dwtps is provided in table s1 considering that it took a certain amount of time from water source to dwtp and to sampling sites in dwds and it was extremely difficult to track the same water package for this large scale field investigation various sampling protocols had been adopted to strengthen the rationality of the sampling procedures when water age information was able to be obtained sampling interval was set based on the water age for the dwtp 1 that used a long distance pipeline for raw water transportation and area c that obtained south water through the snwdp the specific water ages were considered in the sampling process according to the information of the water supply company the raw water was collected 5 h before sampling in dwtp 1 danjiangkou source water sample was collected 15 days before sampling in area c however when water age information was not available sequential sampling was completed in a relatively short period within in 1 day under the hypothesis that the raw water quality and treatment process were maintained in steady state the test results for this hypothesis were given in supplementary information sampling was done sequentially each time according to the water flow sequence for branched pipe networks most of the drinking water sampling sites were distributed along the trunk pipes starting at the dwtps for looped pipe networks due to the joint water supply to multiple dwtps the pipe network layout was intricate it was difficult to distinguish the water supply area of each dwtp therefore the grid distribution method was used in area c and sampling points were evenly arranged with intervals of every 2 3 km when sampling drinking water from the dwds associated with dwtp 1 with the cooperation of the dwtp staff samples were collected during the fire hydrant flushing process on the trunk pipes to minimize the impact of the unknown branch pipes and indoor pipes the turbidity of the water from the fire hydrant increased significantly at the beginning and the water was sampled when the turbidity decreased visibly and dropped to approximately 1 ntu in other areas the drinking water of the dwds was still collected at the user s tap because conditions for sampling from the fire hydrant were not met it takes approximately 2 3 min to drain the water in the indoor pipes before formal sampling the 10 l polypropylene barrels were used to collect water samples which allowed for the more representative water samples and could reduce the impact of water quality fluctuations the specific operations of the mixed sampling strategy and its reliability test results were given in the supplementary information 2 3 sample extraction water samples were pretreated following published methods with some modifications taniyasu et al 2005 zhou et al 2013 briefly 500 ml of water sample was filtered through a glass fiber filter membrane gf f whatman and then spiked with 2 ng of mass labeled standards for sample extraction oasis wax spe cartridges 6 cc 150 mg 30 μm waters usa were used prior to loading samples the oasis wax cartridges were preconditioned with 4 ml of 0 1 ammonium hydroxide in methanol 4 ml of methanol and 4 ml of milli q water and then loaded with the samples at approximately one drop s after loading the cartridges were washed with 4 ml of 25 mm ammonium acetate ph 4 and air dried target compounds were eluted with 4 ml of methanol and 4 ml of 0 1 ammonium hydroxide in methanol the eluents were collected and concentrated to 0 5 ml under a gentle stream of nitrogen and then transferred into a 1 5 ml pp snap top brown glass vial with polyethylene pe septa 2 4 instrument analysis target pfas analysis was performed using an agilent 1200 hplc system coupled with an agilent 6460 triple quadrupole qqq mass spectrometer agilent technologies usa that was operated under negative electrospray ionization esi mode detailed ms ms and instrument parameters are listed in tables s2 and s3 2 5 quality control and method performance quality assurance quality control qa qc procedures were followed during the entire sampling to minimize background contamination contact with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe or other fluoropolymer materials was avoided field transportation procedure and solvent blanks and recoveries were determined for each sample batch to monitor potential contamination the limit of quantification loq was identified as a signal to noise ratio s n 10 while the limit of detection lod was identified as s n 3 the s n was calculated by agilent masshunter qualitative software the lods and loqs ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 ng l and 0 05 to 0 5 ng l for water the mean matrix spike recovery and the procedure recovery of the pfass ranged from 76 to 118 and 81 to 120 for water further detailed qa qc information is shown in table s4 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed with spss statistics 24 ibm usa the significance level was set at 0 05 for data analysis half of the loqs were assigned for analytes when their concentrations were below the corresponding loqs and above the lods 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of pfass in raw water finished water and tap water the concentrations of the pfass detected in eight raw water samples seven finished water samples and 77 tap water samples from the water supply systems of the 7 dwtps are shown in fig 1 and table s5 as shown in fig 1 16 of the 17 targeted pfass were detected while pfoda was not detected in any of the samples as one of the main pfass observed in the survey areas the median concentrations of pfba in raw water finished water and tap water were 28 74 25 24 and 25 60 ng l respectively while the median concentrations of other pfass were all below 10 ng l the range of the total concentrations of 17 pfass was 11 80 265 95 ng l with a median concentration of 56 32 ng l in raw water after the treatment process of dwtps the total pfas concentrations remained at 9 90 236 15 ng l with a median concentration of 44 77 ng l the total pfas concentration range in tap water was 4 59 365 04 ng l and the median was 49 41 ng l it can be seen that the fluctuation range of the pfas concentrations in tap water increased significantly such as pfba fig s2 specifically compares the difference in pfas concentrations between each finished water and the corresponding tap water it can be further found that the changes of pfas concentrations from the finished water to the dwds were not the same for example the concentrations of 8 pfass in dwtp 1 collectively increased by 10 44 ng l while the other pfass decreased by 8 89 ng l it indicated that both deposition and release phenomena of pfass might occur in dwdss fig 2 a further shows the pfas concentration distribution in the raw water finished water and tap water corresponding to each dwtp the concentrations of pfass in the dwtp 1 area with taihu lake as the water source were much higher than those in other areas the dwtp 1 area was characterized by relatively higher pfhxs concentrations which was obviously different from other dwtps with pfba as the characteristic pollutant fig 2b the pfas concentrations in the water sources of luoma lake dwtp 2 and snwdp dwtp 3 4 5 were basically at the same level the proportions of pfoa and pfhpa in luoma lake were higher and pfpea was lower than corresponding measurements in south water which also determined the distribution characteristics of pfass in subsequent finished water and tap water dwtp 6 was a mixed water supply for south water and groundwater the concentrations and species of pfass in the two water sources were quite different groundwater played a role in diluting the pfas concentrations in south water this difference made the species of pfass in the dwds of the dwtp 6 water supply area significantly different from the species in other areas a similar situation occurred in dwtp 7 the groundwater used by dwtp 7 was well protected and not susceptible to pollution by surface industrial areas or airborne pfass therefore the pfas concentrations in groundwater were relatively low and the distribution of various pfass was uniform this finding proved that the groundwater has not suffered concentrated pfas pollution if the water source was polluted the local water source was more likely to show one or more characteristic pfass which may be related to the local fluorine chemical industry production mode and product use type the proportion of pfba in finished water of dwtp 7 which originally did not account for the majority of the raw water and the finished water increased significantly after entering the dwds this implied that there was a process of continuous mixing of different water qualities in the dwds 3 2 the transport behaviors of pfass under different water source transportation modes the transportation characteristics of pfass are presented from the water source to the dwtp fig 3 the contamination degree of the water source determined the basic characteristics of the pfas level and type of the water supply area and the difference in the water transportation mode of the water source could still affect the quality of the influent water dwtp 1 obtained raw water from taihu lake through a 22 km raw water pipeline during the transportation process the total pfas concentration was gradually reduced along the pipeline the local characteristic pfas which was pfhxs in the influent water yielded the most significant concentration decrease compared to that in the raw water this phenomenon was the same as the decrease in the concentration of long chain pfas previously observed along the branched pipeline which may be caused by the accumulation of loose deposits chen et al 2019 and biofilms dalahmeh et al 2019 in the dwds this indicated that the raw water transportation pipeline had a certain purification effect on pfass however the pfass accumulated on the deposits or pipe scales would continue to increase and become a potential risk dwtp 2 drew water locally with source water being the influent water thus there was no further discussion the raw water of dwtp 3 4 5 was the south water from the danjiangkou reservoir which was transported through the middle route of the snwtp after a long trek of 1276 km the south water was inevitably polluted by pfass to a certain proportion and the total pfas concentration increased 183 19 191 15 and 211 56 when it reached dwtp 3 dwtp 4 and dwtp 5 respectively the sources of pfass to the middle route of the snwtp could be very complex pfass could directly release to the atmosphere from fluorochemical manufacturing park prevedouros et al 2006 and then the volatile pfass would return to the surface environment with the help of rain snow atmospheric particles etc butt et al 2010 yao et al 2016 previous studies have reported that pfas precursors could transform into pfass by natural process styler et al 2013 the volatile pfas precursors could be transported by the atmosphere converted to pfass by atmospheric oxidation and subsequently returned to the surface environment by wet and dry deposition casal et al 2017 ellis et al 2004 in addition under sunlight irradiation the surface of natural clay minerals which were the main components of the soil could facilitate the conversion the pfas precursors adsorbed on them into pfcas especially short chain pfcas lv et al 2020 soil located in the riparian zone could carry pfass into the bulk water all of the above processes might occur in the open channel of the snwtp during water transportation however pollution along the route did not cause the pfas concentration in the water receiving area to exceed the current international health standards e g usepa pfoa pfos or pfoa pfos 70 ng l notably dwtp 3 was supplied directly from the southern canal while the south water used in dwtp 4 and dwtp 5 was transported through the regulation pool and the open canal of area c the presence of the regulation pool could further increase the content of pfass in the south water both the regulating pond and the open canal were located in the city which was more likely to face pfas pollution caused by the use of fluorochemical products dwtp 6 adopted a multisource mixed water supply mode after a series of treatment processes at the plant south water rwⅰ 6 was mixed with groundwater rwⅱ 6 in the clean water pool and chlorinated together before leaving the water utility therefore the water quality impact of the multisource mixed water supply mode was directly reflected in the finished water the concentration level and the species of pfass were the result of the mixing of the two raw waters which have been described in the previous section the groundwater used by dwtp 7 was transported through pipelines from a pressure boosting station 13 km away to dwtp 7 and the water at the pressure boosting station came from a more distant groundwater source in the periphery of area c the groundwater of the pressure boosting station obtained in this investigation was considered to be raw water rw 7 after long distance pipeline transportation and the chlorine oxidation process in dwtp 7 the pfas concentration in the finished water was reduced to a certain extent due to the ineffectiveness of chlorine oxidation on pfass appleman et al 2014 the reduction in concentration could be caused by the purification effect of the long distance transportation pipeline 3 3 removal of pfass by water treatment processes the complete treatment processes of the seven dwtps are provided in table s1 fig 2 and table s6 show that the removal effect of each dwtp on pfass was highly distinct dwtp 6 was not discussed because the treatment process water samples were not availabe dwtp 3 had the highest removal rate for pfass at 30 15 however a negative effect occurred in dwtp 5 10 87 dwtp 1 dwtp 2 and dwtp 4 adopted the same advanced treatment processes while the removal rates were far different due to the difference in physical chemical properties of pfass the treatment efficiency was expected to vary widely li et al 2020a park et al 2020 to investigate the behaviors of pfass in the drinking water treatment process pfass were divided into five groups according to chain length c4 c5 c7 c8 c9 c12 c13 c18 to observe the removal effect of each treatment process on various pfass fig 4 shows the variation in pfas concentrations in the effluent of the treatment process collected from each dwtp dwtp 3 4 5 cannot yield effluent from all processes the treatment processes of dwtp 1 and dwtp 5 were ineffective for pfas removal while the o3 bac filter unit in dwtp 1 could remove c5 c7 pfass especially pfhxs c6 with a removal rate of 15 32 δ 21 63 ng l this was also the process with the largest removal quantity among the dwtps in this investigation however the pfas concentration increased after coagulation sedimentation sand filter and chlorine oxidation in dwtp 1 which was consistent with the phenomenon observed in actual dwtps reported in previous studies rahman et al 2014 tabtong et al 2015 takagi et al 2011 the dwtp 7 which only used the chlorine oxidation process seemed to show a relatively high removal rate 16 09 of the total pfas concentration but due to the low pfas concentration in raw groundwater the reduction was only 1 90 ng l which could be negligible the above phenomena confirmed that coagulation sedimentation and chlorine disinfection do not have effective removal capacity for pfass for dwtp 2 and dwtp 4 the o3 bac filter was still the most effective treatment process for pfass with removal rates of 12 77 and 23 65 respectively the gac unit in dwtp 5 did not show an obvious removal effect which could be related to carbon aging the removal capacity of pfass by activated carbon decreased significantly after one year of use belkouteb et al 2020 in addition dwtp 5 was the only dwtp in this survey that did not have ozone preceding gac previous studies have reported that in the o3 bac filter treatment process pfas precursor compounds can be degraded by ozonation to form pfass anumol et al 2016 glover et al 2018 and pfass can be produced through a biotransformation of pfas precursors sinclair and kannan 2006 resulting in an increase in pfas concentration this was contrary to the results of our investigation this might be because the raw water did not contain pfas precursors for ozone degradation and the biological effect on bac was not strong therefore o3 bac could provide a certain degree of removal effect which was credited to the remaining sorption capacity of the bac glover et al 2018 the performance of o3 bac in removing pfass was better than that of gac which could be due to the presence of biofilms that degraded organic matter thus providing more sites for pfas adsorption dalahmeh et al 2019 in this study dwtp 3 was the only dwtp that uses the uv process which contributed to the largest proportion of pfas removal in the whole treatment process removal rate 23 18 mainly removing short chain pfass previous studies have suggested that uv irradiation was not effective in removing pfass quiñones and snyder 2009 rahman et al 2014 but some studies have also pointed out that when fe3 was involved in the uv reaction the photodegradation ability of short chain pfass increased significantly hori et al 2007 li et al 2020a dwtp 3 mainly used iron salt coagulant in the coagulation process therefore it can be inferred that the iron salt added by the water treatment plant might serve as an effective catalyst for photodegradation in summary the various processes have unsatisfactory removal effects on pfass only activated carbon and uv treatment can show a certain removal ability but the effect was not stable therefore to ensure the safety of drinking water from potential contamination by pfass emphasis should be placed on water source protection 3 4 the behaviors of pfass in dwdss 3 4 1 branched dwdss branched dwdss and looped dwdss have different effects on pfas transport behavior due to the difference in water supply mode and pipeline structure dwtp 1 was a typical branched dwds for water supply fig 5 shows the concentration change of pfhxs the characteristic pfas in the water supply area in the drinking water along the trunk pipeline the pfhxs concentration had a clear downward trend along the trunk pipe with the concentration at point 5 decreased by 28 60 25 30 ng l compared to the pfhxs concentration in finished water point 0 this was consistent with previous studies demonstrating the accumulation capacity of loose deposits for pfhxs in the dwds chen et al 2019 when water moved from the trunk to the bypass of the pipeline the flow rate gradually slowed and the hydraulic residence time increased resulting in the formation and accumulation of loose deposits intensified li et al 2019a as the diameter of the pipeline decreased fire hydrant flushing was more likely to cause a disturbance of loose deposits in the dwds especially at point 8 due to the special corner structure of the pipeline there the accumulation of loose deposits would increase with the extension of hydraulic retention time li et al 2020b when the fire hydrant was opened in order to sample water hydraulic disturbance caused the release into bulk water of accumulated pfhxs due to the large amount of deposits here the pfhxs concentration increased most significantly by 121 16 76 52 ng l compared to point 5 and 57 91 51 22 ng l compared to finished water in addition the sudden increase in the concentration of pfhxs was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the concentration of multiple types of longer chain pfass as shown in fig s3 pfhpa c7 pfoa c8 pfna c9 pfda c10 and pfos c8 which are longer chain pfass also showed a significant increase in concentration at point 8 compared with pfba c4 pfpea c5 pfhxa c6 pfbs c4 and other shorter chain pfass this phenomenon was consistent with the findings of previous studies previous studies have proposed the organic carbon normalized adsorption coefficient log koc as an indicator of partitioning for individual pfass between water and sediment ahrens et al 2010 as the log koc increases the potential of sorption to sediments is enhanced higgins and luthy 2006 since the log koc of long chain pfass is higher than their short chain counterparts buck et al 2011 wang et al 2015 this means it is easier for the long chain pfass to accumulate on the loose deposits in dwdss while short chain pfass are more likely to migrate with water chen et al 2019 this suggests that these co elevated long chain pfass were caused by the release of accumulated pfass on the loose deposits in the dwds the previously described abrupt increase in pfhxs concentration was also verified to be of loose deposit origin the dwtp 2 pipe network was also a branched pipeline as shown in fig s4 the concentrations of pfass in the whole process of transportation and distribution were relatively stable and the concentrations of long chain pfass were too low to observe obvious phenomena in the dwds 8 ng l the higher concentration of pfba c4 did not tend to adsorb to the deposit which further illustrated the transport characteristics of pfass of different chain lengths in the branched pipelines 3 4 2 looped dwdss compared with the branched dwdss the looped dwdss usually have better hydraulic conditions and shorter hydraulic residence times since area c jointly adopted a large scale looped dwds supplied by several dwtps it was not able to divide all the drinking water sampling sites according to the water supply area of the dwtps therefore an overall analysis of all drinking water was carried out first fig 6 is a distribution diagram of the total concentration of 17 pfass in the tap water in area c that was jointly supplied by dwtp 3 4 5 6 7 the pfas concentration in the tap water around each dwtp was similar to the corresponding pfas concentration in the finished water as the water supplies for each dwtp converged in the looped dwds the pfas concentration was constantly mixed and became more uniform therefore the distribution of pfas concentration in the looped dwds might be dependent on the concentration difference of the water supply from each dwtp and the degree of water mixing in the dwds good hydraulic conditions shortened the hydraulic retention time and made the accumulation effect of deposits in the dwds less obvious 4 conclusions raw water pipeline transport process could reduce the long chain pfass in raw water however the long distance water transport process with open channels and lakes could introduce a certain degree of pfas contamination dwtp treatment processes could not achieve satisfactory effects on pfas removal but the o3 bac and uv advanced treatment processes provided a certain degree of treatment effect loose deposit in branched dwdss could affect the distribution of pfass while the distribution of pfas concentrations in looped dwdss was dependent on the pfas concentration of the finished water from each dwtp and the degree of water mixing in the dwds declaration of competing interest the authors

17008,perfluoroalkyl substances pfass can occur in water sources pass through drinking water treatment plants dwtps drinking water distribution systems dwdss to the consumer taps this investigation was carried out to present the transportation behaviors of 17 pfass involving seven dwtps with different water sources raw water transportation modes treatment processes and dwds structures in eastern and northern china the results showed that the long distance raw water transportation pipelines removed a certain extent of pfass from raw water probably due to the accumulation of loose deposits the long distance open channel south to north water diversion increased pfas contamination risk in the dwtps granular activated carbon gac adsorption and ultraviolet radiation removed less than 25 of pfass but ozonation biological activated carbon o3 bac was superior to gac alone in removing pfass loose deposits couldsignificantly influence pfas accumulation and release within branch structured

system transportation characteristics 1 introduction perfluoroalkyl substances pfass are a group of anthropogenic environmental pollutants and are used extensively as additives in food packaging firefighting foams and surface treatment agents for textiles rahman et al 2014 these uses derive from the unique properties of pfass including high thermal and chemical stability surface activity and hydrooleophobicity pfass are typically found in rivers sun et al 2016 soil outdoor dust yao et al 2016 and even human plasma poothong et al 2017 zhou et al 2014 and bones koskela et al 2017 multiple studies have reported a significant correlation between pfas concentrations in drinking water and blood zhang et al 2019 and pfass have been frequently detected in drinking water which is one major pathway for human exposure to pfass the u s environmental protection agency usepa third unregulated contaminant monitoring rule database showed 40 of the drinking water pfas concentrations 2013 2015 exceeding the usepa health advisory of 70 ng l for individual or combined perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid pfos usepa 2016 concentrations in public water supplies hurley et al 2016 the detection frequencies of short chain pfass in drinking water of many countries including canada france and japan were within the range of 64 92 2015 2016 kaboré et al 2018 in china the mean of the sum concentrations of the 17 pfass was 35 13 ng l 4 49 174 93 ng l 2017 li et al 2019b and pfass in drinking water of eastern china were relatively higher than those in other regions chen et al 2019 once the source water is contaminated with pfass it will directly affect drinking water quality previous studies reported that pfas concentrations in drinking water around fluorochemical manufacturing parks jin et al 2015 and fire training areas hu et al 2016 were significantly higher than those in other areas to obtain a sufficient or higher quality water source according to their own location conditions drinking water treatment plants dwtps need to choose different water transportation modes a dwtp located next to its water source can collect water directly dwtps far from the water source must use water transportation pipelines xu et al 2020 even by aid of open channels and rivers to obtain raw water over long distances an example of the latter is taihu lake a large scale water source that supplies raw water to multiple cities through water transportation pipelines xu et al 2018 the south to north water diversion project snwdp in china is by far the largest interbasin water transfer project in the world south water provided 73 of drinking water to beijing an important water receiving area through the middle route of the snwdp over a distance of 1276 km in addition when raw water cannot provide a sufficient water supply dwtps will adopt a mixed water transportation mode of multiple raw water sources however few studies have focused on the risk of pfas pollution caused by different types of raw water and water transportation modes the treatment process of dwtps has difficulty purifying pfas contaminated water sources previous studies have shown that coagulation sedimentation filtration chlorine disinfection and other conventional processes have very limited effectiveness on pfas removal xiao et al 2013 granular activated carbon gac is considered to be effective for pfas treatment in dwtps glover et al 2018 however the treatment effect of gac gradually disappeared as carbon ages increased and possible desorption of pfass might occur watanabe et al 2011 the phenomenon that the effluent concentration is higher than the influent concentration is called the chromatographic effect hand et al 1997 park et al 2020 activated carbon pore characteristics and changing influent composition can affect the desorption behavior of contaminants aschermann et al 2019 2018 in recent years many dwtps have gradually upgraded their treatment processes with ozone uv ultrafiltration etc although these processes have proven unsatisfactory for pfas removal in some laboratory studies however there are relatively few investigations on the performance of pfas treatment by advanced treatment processes in full scale dwtps in addition to examining the removal effect it is also important to evaluate the potential risks associated with the treatment process a drinking water distribution system dwds is key to ensuring drinking water safety and the deterioration of water quality often occurs in dwdss cerrato et al 2006 kim et al 2011 li et al 2019a the dwds environment will affect the transport behavior of pfass it has been reported that pfass especially long chain pfass would accumulate by loose deposits on the pipe wall thus showing a downward trend of concentration during the distribution process chen et al 2019 water quality variation can also become an important factor affecting the distribution of pfass in dwdss chen et al 2021 although there are few studies focused on this issue the structure of a dwds is usually divided into branched pipeline and looped pipe networks the branched pipeline is used mostly for small scale township water supply the structure has the characteristics of long pipelines small population low water consumption and long hydraulic retention time ma et al 2019 yu et al 2019 correspondingly the accumulation of loose deposits is more likely to occur in branched pipelines the looped pipe network is used mostly in urban water supply with a large coverage area where the population is concentrated and the water consumption is high li et al 2011 therefore the looped pipe network has better hydraulic conditions and more uniform water quality at present there are few studies comparing the transport behavior of pfass in different types of actual dwdss this study was motivated to better understand the fate of pfass from water sources to dwtps and further to dwdss seven water supply systems located in eastern and northern china were selected to compare 1 the possible impact of different raw water and water transportation modes on pfas compositions and concentrations 2 the efficiency of pfas removal in different dwtp treatment processes and 3 the pfas transportation characteristics in branched pipe networks versus looped pipe networks the results from this study can provide a reference and guidance for identifying and monitoring pfas risks from water sources to tap water 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents a total of 17 pfass 13 pfcas 4 pfsas were selected for investigation with their names listed in text 1 of the supplementary material native standards and mass labeled internal standards were purchased from wellington laboratories ontario canada high performance liquid chromatography hplc grade methanol and acetonitrile were purchased from fisher scientific ottawa canada hplc grade ammonium acetate 99 0 ammonium hydroxide solutions 25 in h2o and acetic acid 99 were purchased from aladdin co shanghai china 2 2 study sites and sample collection a total of 115 water samples 8 raw water 38 dwtp treatment process water and 77 dwds water samples from seven dwtps dwtps 1 7 were collected from july 2018 to october 2019 from different areas of china fig s1 dwtp 1 is located in area a this area uses approximately 22 km of raw water transportation pipelines to convey water from taihu lake to dwtp 1 and supplies water to local towns through branched pipe networks dwtp 2 located in area b obtains raw water directly from adjacent luoma lake and uses branched pipe networks to supply drinking water dwtps 3 5 located in area c use south water from the middle route of the snwdp as their raw water after south water enters area c the water travels to dwtp 3 through the southern canal and to dwtp 4 and 5 after passing through a regulation pool dwtp 6 uses mixed raw water from south water and local groundwater dwtp 7 uses groundwater as raw water different from groundwater of dwtp 6 dwtps 3 7 jointly supply drinking water for area c through a looped pipe network the information including name location source water type and water treatment process of the dwtps is provided in table s1 considering that it took a certain amount of time from water source to dwtp and to sampling sites in dwds and it was extremely difficult to track the same water package for this large scale field investigation various sampling protocols had been adopted to strengthen the rationality of the sampling procedures when water age information was able to be obtained sampling interval was set based on the water age for the dwtp 1 that used a long distance pipeline for raw water transportation and area c that obtained south water through the snwdp the specific water ages were considered in the sampling process according to the information of the water supply company the raw water was collected 5 h before sampling in dwtp 1 danjiangkou source water sample was collected 15 days before sampling in area c however when water age information was not available sequential sampling was completed in a relatively short period within in 1 day under the hypothesis that the raw water quality and treatment process were maintained in steady state the test results for this hypothesis were given in supplementary information sampling was done sequentially each time according to the water flow sequence for branched pipe networks most of the drinking water sampling sites were distributed along the trunk pipes starting at the dwtps for looped pipe networks due to the joint water supply to multiple dwtps the pipe network layout was intricate it was difficult to distinguish the water supply area of each dwtp therefore the grid distribution method was used in area c and sampling points were evenly arranged with intervals of every 2 3 km when sampling drinking water from the dwds associated with dwtp 1 with the cooperation of the dwtp staff samples were collected during the fire hydrant flushing process on the trunk pipes to minimize the impact of the unknown branch pipes and indoor pipes the turbidity of the water from the fire hydrant increased significantly at the beginning and the water was sampled when the turbidity decreased visibly and dropped to approximately 1 ntu in other areas the drinking water of the dwds was still collected at the user s tap because conditions for sampling from the fire hydrant were not met it takes approximately 2 3 min to drain the water in the indoor pipes before formal sampling the 10 l polypropylene barrels were used to collect water samples which allowed for the more representative water samples and could reduce the impact of water quality fluctuations the specific operations of the mixed sampling strategy and its reliability test results were given in the supplementary information 2 3 sample extraction water samples were pretreated following published methods with some modifications taniyasu et al 2005 zhou et al 2013 briefly 500 ml of water sample was filtered through a glass fiber filter membrane gf f whatman and then spiked with 2 ng of mass labeled standards for sample extraction oasis wax spe cartridges 6 cc 150 mg 30 μm waters usa were used prior to loading samples the oasis wax cartridges were preconditioned with 4 ml of 0 1 ammonium hydroxide in methanol 4 ml of methanol and 4 ml of milli q water and then loaded with the samples at approximately one drop s after loading the cartridges were washed with 4 ml of 25 mm ammonium acetate ph 4 and air dried target compounds were eluted with 4 ml of methanol and 4 ml of 0 1 ammonium hydroxide in methanol the eluents were collected and concentrated to 0 5 ml under a gentle stream of nitrogen and then transferred into a 1 5 ml pp snap top brown glass vial with polyethylene pe septa 2 4 instrument analysis target pfas analysis was performed using an agilent 1200 hplc system coupled with an agilent 6460 triple quadrupole qqq mass spectrometer agilent technologies usa that was operated under negative electrospray ionization esi mode detailed ms ms and instrument parameters are listed in tables s2 and s3 2 5 quality control and method performance quality assurance quality control qa qc procedures were followed during the entire sampling to minimize background contamination contact with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe or other fluoropolymer materials was avoided field transportation procedure and solvent blanks and recoveries were determined for each sample batch to monitor potential contamination the limit of quantification loq was identified as a signal to noise ratio s n 10 while the limit of detection lod was identified as s n 3 the s n was calculated by agilent masshunter qualitative software the lods and loqs ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 ng l and 0 05 to 0 5 ng l for water the mean matrix spike recovery and the procedure recovery of the pfass ranged from 76 to 118 and 81 to 120 for water further detailed qa qc information is shown in table s4 2 6 statistical analysis all statistical analyses were performed with spss statistics 24 ibm usa the significance level was set at 0 05 for data analysis half of the loqs were assigned for analytes when their concentrations were below the corresponding loqs and above the lods 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence of pfass in raw water finished water and tap water the concentrations of the pfass detected in eight raw water samples seven finished water samples and 77 tap water samples from the water supply systems of the 7 dwtps are shown in fig 1 and table s5 as shown in fig 1 16 of the 17 targeted pfass were detected while pfoda was not detected in any of the samples as one of the main pfass observed in the survey areas the median concentrations of pfba in raw water finished water and tap water were 28 74 25 24 and 25 60 ng l respectively while the median concentrations of other pfass were all below 10 ng l the range of the total concentrations of 17 pfass was 11 80 265 95 ng l with a median concentration of 56 32 ng l in raw water after the treatment process of dwtps the total pfas concentrations remained at 9 90 236 15 ng l with a median concentration of 44 77 ng l the total pfas concentration range in tap water was 4 59 365 04 ng l and the median was 49 41 ng l it can be seen that the fluctuation range of the pfas concentrations in tap water increased significantly such as pfba fig s2 specifically compares the difference in pfas concentrations between each finished water and the corresponding tap water it can be further found that the changes of pfas concentrations from the finished water to the dwds were not the same for example the concentrations of 8 pfass in dwtp 1 collectively increased by 10 44 ng l while the other pfass decreased by 8 89 ng l it indicated that both deposition and release phenomena of pfass might occur in dwdss fig 2 a further shows the pfas concentration distribution in the raw water finished water and tap water corresponding to each dwtp the concentrations of pfass in the dwtp 1 area with taihu lake as the water source were much higher than those in other areas the dwtp 1 area was characterized by relatively higher pfhxs concentrations which was obviously different from other dwtps with pfba as the characteristic pollutant fig 2b the pfas concentrations in the water sources of luoma lake dwtp 2 and snwdp dwtp 3 4 5 were basically at the same level the proportions of pfoa and pfhpa in luoma lake were higher and pfpea was lower than corresponding measurements in south water which also determined the distribution characteristics of pfass in subsequent finished water and tap water dwtp 6 was a mixed water supply for south water and groundwater the concentrations and species of pfass in the two water sources were quite different groundwater played a role in diluting the pfas concentrations in south water this difference made the species of pfass in the dwds of the dwtp 6 water supply area significantly different from the species in other areas a similar situation occurred in dwtp 7 the groundwater used by dwtp 7 was well protected and not susceptible to pollution by surface industrial areas or airborne pfass therefore the pfas concentrations in groundwater were relatively low and the distribution of various pfass was uniform this finding proved that the groundwater has not suffered concentrated pfas pollution if the water source was polluted the local water source was more likely to show one or more characteristic pfass which may be related to the local fluorine chemical industry production mode and product use type the proportion of pfba in finished water of dwtp 7 which originally did not account for the majority of the raw water and the finished water increased significantly after entering the dwds this implied that there was a process of continuous mixing of different water qualities in the dwds 3 2 the transport behaviors of pfass under different water source transportation modes the transportation characteristics of pfass are presented from the water source to the dwtp fig 3 the contamination degree of the water source determined the basic characteristics of the pfas level and type of the water supply area and the difference in the water transportation mode of the water source could still affect the quality of the influent water dwtp 1 obtained raw water from taihu lake through a 22 km raw water pipeline during the transportation process the total pfas concentration was gradually reduced along the pipeline the local characteristic pfas which was pfhxs in the influent water yielded the most significant concentration decrease compared to that in the raw water this phenomenon was the same as the decrease in the concentration of long chain pfas previously observed along the branched pipeline which may be caused by the accumulation of loose deposits chen et al 2019 and biofilms dalahmeh et al 2019 in the dwds this indicated that the raw water transportation pipeline had a certain purification effect on pfass however the pfass accumulated on the deposits or pipe scales would continue to increase and become a potential risk dwtp 2 drew water locally with source water being the influent water thus there was no further discussion the raw water of dwtp 3 4 5 was the south water from the danjiangkou reservoir which was transported through the middle route of the snwtp after a long trek of 1276 km the south water was inevitably polluted by pfass to a certain proportion and the total pfas concentration increased 183 19 191 15 and 211 56 when it reached dwtp 3 dwtp 4 and dwtp 5 respectively the sources of pfass to the middle route of the snwtp could be very complex pfass could directly release to the atmosphere from fluorochemical manufacturing park prevedouros et al 2006 and then the volatile pfass would return to the surface environment with the help of rain snow atmospheric particles etc butt et al 2010 yao et al 2016 previous studies have reported that pfas precursors could transform into pfass by natural process styler et al 2013 the volatile pfas precursors could be transported by the atmosphere converted to pfass by atmospheric oxidation and subsequently returned to the surface environment by wet and dry deposition casal et al 2017 ellis et al 2004 in addition under sunlight irradiation the surface of natural clay minerals which were the main components of the soil could facilitate the conversion the pfas precursors adsorbed on them into pfcas especially short chain pfcas lv et al 2020 soil located in the riparian zone could carry pfass into the bulk water all of the above processes might occur in the open channel of the snwtp during water transportation however pollution along the route did not cause the pfas concentration in the water receiving area to exceed the current international health standards e g usepa pfoa pfos or pfoa pfos 70 ng l notably dwtp 3 was supplied directly from the southern canal while the south water used in dwtp 4 and dwtp 5 was transported through the regulation pool and the open canal of area c the presence of the regulation pool could further increase the content of pfass in the south water both the regulating pond and the open canal were located in the city which was more likely to face pfas pollution caused by the use of fluorochemical products dwtp 6 adopted a multisource mixed water supply mode after a series of treatment processes at the plant south water rwⅰ 6 was mixed with groundwater rwⅱ 6 in the clean water pool and chlorinated together before leaving the water utility therefore the water quality impact of the multisource mixed water supply mode was directly reflected in the finished water the concentration level and the species of pfass were the result of the mixing of the two raw waters which have been described in the previous section the groundwater used by dwtp 7 was transported through pipelines from a pressure boosting station 13 km away to dwtp 7 and the water at the pressure boosting station came from a more distant groundwater source in the periphery of area c the groundwater of the pressure boosting station obtained in this investigation was considered to be raw water rw 7 after long distance pipeline transportation and the chlorine oxidation process in dwtp 7 the pfas concentration in the finished water was reduced to a certain extent due to the ineffectiveness of chlorine oxidation on pfass appleman et al 2014 the reduction in concentration could be caused by the purification effect of the long distance transportation pipeline 3 3 removal of pfass by water treatment processes the complete treatment processes of the seven dwtps are provided in table s1 fig 2 and table s6 show that the removal effect of each dwtp on pfass was highly distinct dwtp 6 was not discussed because the treatment process water samples were not availabe dwtp 3 had the highest removal rate for pfass at 30 15 however a negative effect occurred in dwtp 5 10 87 dwtp 1 dwtp 2 and dwtp 4 adopted the same advanced treatment processes while the removal rates were far different due to the difference in physical chemical properties of pfass the treatment efficiency was expected to vary widely li et al 2020a park et al 2020 to investigate the behaviors of pfass in the drinking water treatment process pfass were divided into five groups according to chain length c4 c5 c7 c8 c9 c12 c13 c18 to observe the removal effect of each treatment process on various pfass fig 4 shows the variation in pfas concentrations in the effluent of the treatment process collected from each dwtp dwtp 3 4 5 cannot yield effluent from all processes the treatment processes of dwtp 1 and dwtp 5 were ineffective for pfas removal while the o3 bac filter unit in dwtp 1 could remove c5 c7 pfass especially pfhxs c6 with a removal rate of 15 32 δ 21 63 ng l this was also the process with the largest removal quantity among the dwtps in this investigation however the pfas concentration increased after coagulation sedimentation sand filter and chlorine oxidation in dwtp 1 which was consistent with the phenomenon observed in actual dwtps reported in previous studies rahman et al 2014 tabtong et al 2015 takagi et al 2011 the dwtp 7 which only used the chlorine oxidation process seemed to show a relatively high removal rate 16 09 of the total pfas concentration but due to the low pfas concentration in raw groundwater the reduction was only 1 90 ng l which could be negligible the above phenomena confirmed that coagulation sedimentation and chlorine disinfection do not have effective removal capacity for pfass for dwtp 2 and dwtp 4 the o3 bac filter was still the most effective treatment process for pfass with removal rates of 12 77 and 23 65 respectively the gac unit in dwtp 5 did not show an obvious removal effect which could be related to carbon aging the removal capacity of pfass by activated carbon decreased significantly after one year of use belkouteb et al 2020 in addition dwtp 5 was the only dwtp in this survey that did not have ozone preceding gac previous studies have reported that in the o3 bac filter treatment process pfas precursor compounds can be degraded by ozonation to form pfass anumol et al 2016 glover et al 2018 and pfass can be produced through a biotransformation of pfas precursors sinclair and kannan 2006 resulting in an increase in pfas concentration this was contrary to the results of our investigation this might be because the raw water did not contain pfas precursors for ozone degradation and the biological effect on bac was not strong therefore o3 bac could provide a certain degree of removal effect which was credited to the remaining sorption capacity of the bac glover et al 2018 the performance of o3 bac in removing pfass was better than that of gac which could be due to the presence of biofilms that degraded organic matter thus providing more sites for pfas adsorption dalahmeh et al 2019 in this study dwtp 3 was the only dwtp that uses the uv process which contributed to the largest proportion of pfas removal in the whole treatment process removal rate 23 18 mainly removing short chain pfass previous studies have suggested that uv irradiation was not effective in removing pfass quiñones and snyder 2009 rahman et al 2014 but some studies have also pointed out that when fe3 was involved in the uv reaction the photodegradation ability of short chain pfass increased significantly hori et al 2007 li et al 2020a dwtp 3 mainly used iron salt coagulant in the coagulation process therefore it can be inferred that the iron salt added by the water treatment plant might serve as an effective catalyst for photodegradation in summary the various processes have unsatisfactory removal effects on pfass only activated carbon and uv treatment can show a certain removal ability but the effect was not stable therefore to ensure the safety of drinking water from potential contamination by pfass emphasis should be placed on water source protection 3 4 the behaviors of pfass in dwdss 3 4 1 branched dwdss branched dwdss and looped dwdss have different effects on pfas transport behavior due to the difference in water supply mode and pipeline structure dwtp 1 was a typical branched dwds for water supply fig 5 shows the concentration change of pfhxs the characteristic pfas in the water supply area in the drinking water along the trunk pipeline the pfhxs concentration had a clear downward trend along the trunk pipe with the concentration at point 5 decreased by 28 60 25 30 ng l compared to the pfhxs concentration in finished water point 0 this was consistent with previous studies demonstrating the accumulation capacity of loose deposits for pfhxs in the dwds chen et al 2019 when water moved from the trunk to the bypass of the pipeline the flow rate gradually slowed and the hydraulic residence time increased resulting in the formation and accumulation of loose deposits intensified li et al 2019a as the diameter of the pipeline decreased fire hydrant flushing was more likely to cause a disturbance of loose deposits in the dwds especially at point 8 due to the special corner structure of the pipeline there the accumulation of loose deposits would increase with the extension of hydraulic retention time li et al 2020b when the fire hydrant was opened in order to sample water hydraulic disturbance caused the release into bulk water of accumulated pfhxs due to the large amount of deposits here the pfhxs concentration increased most significantly by 121 16 76 52 ng l compared to point 5 and 57 91 51 22 ng l compared to finished water in addition the sudden increase in the concentration of pfhxs was accompanied by a simultaneous increase in the concentration of multiple types of longer chain pfass as shown in fig s3 pfhpa c7 pfoa c8 pfna c9 pfda c10 and pfos c8 which are longer chain pfass also showed a significant increase in concentration at point 8 compared with pfba c4 pfpea c5 pfhxa c6 pfbs c4 and other shorter chain pfass this phenomenon was consistent with the findings of previous studies previous studies have proposed the organic carbon normalized adsorption coefficient log koc as an indicator of partitioning for individual pfass between water and sediment ahrens et al 2010 as the log koc increases the potential of sorption to sediments is enhanced higgins and luthy 2006 since the log koc of long chain pfass is higher than their short chain counterparts buck et al 2011 wang et al 2015 this means it is easier for the long chain pfass to accumulate on the loose deposits in dwdss while short chain pfass are more likely to migrate with water chen et al 2019 this suggests that these co elevated long chain pfass were caused by the release of accumulated pfass on the loose deposits in the dwds the previously described abrupt increase in pfhxs concentration was also verified to be of loose deposit origin the dwtp 2 pipe network was also a branched pipeline as shown in fig s4 the concentrations of pfass in the whole process of transportation and distribution were relatively stable and the concentrations of long chain pfass were too low to observe obvious phenomena in the dwds 8 ng l the higher concentration of pfba c4 did not tend to adsorb to the deposit which further illustrated the transport characteristics of pfass of different chain lengths in the branched pipelines 3 4 2 looped dwdss compared with the branched dwdss the looped dwdss usually have better hydraulic conditions and shorter hydraulic residence times since area c jointly adopted a large scale looped dwds supplied by several dwtps it was not able to divide all the drinking water sampling sites according to the water supply area of the dwtps therefore an overall analysis of all drinking water was carried out first fig 6 is a distribution diagram of the total concentration of 17 pfass in the tap water in area c that was jointly supplied by dwtp 3 4 5 6 7 the pfas concentration in the tap water around each dwtp was similar to the corresponding pfas concentration in the finished water as the water supplies for each dwtp converged in the looped dwds the pfas concentration was constantly mixed and became more uniform therefore the distribution of pfas concentration in the looped dwds might be dependent on the concentration difference of the water supply from each dwtp and the degree of water mixing in the dwds good hydraulic conditions shortened the hydraulic retention time and made the accumulation effect of deposits in the dwds less obvious 4 conclusions raw water pipeline transport process could reduce the long chain pfass in raw water however the long distance water transport process with open channels and lakes could introduce a certain degree of pfas contamination dwtp treatment processes could not achieve satisfactory effects on pfas removal but the o3 bac and uv advanced treatment processes provided a certain degree of treatment effect loose deposit in branched dwdss could affect the distribution of pfass while the distribution of pfas concentrations in looped dwdss was dependent on the pfas concentration of the finished water from each dwtp and the degree of water mixing in the dwds declaration of competing interest the authors

17009,pure culture studies have shown that biofilm dispersal can be triggered if the nutrient supply is discontinued by stopping the flow stimulating biofilm dispersal in this manner would provide a sustainable manner to control unwanted biofilm growth in industrial settings for instance on synthetic membranes used to purify water the response of multispecies biofilms to nutrient limitation has not been thoroughly studied to assess biomass dispersal during nutrient limitation it is common practise to flush the biofilm after a stop period hence flow stop induced biomass removal could occur as a response to nutrient limitation followed by mechanical removal due to biofilm flushing e g biofilm detachment here we investigated the feasibility to reduce membrane biofouling by stopping the flow and flushing the membrane using a membrane fouling simulator biomass removal from synthetic membranes after different stop periods was determined as well as biomass removal at different cross flow velocities biomass removal from membrane surfaces depended on the nutrient limiting period and on the flow velocity during the biofilm flush when flushed at a low flow velocity 0 1 m s 1 the duration of the stop period had a large effect on the biomass removal rate but when the flow velocity was increased to 0 2 m s 1 the length of the stop period became less considerable the flow velocity during membrane flushing has an effect on the bacterial community that colonized the membranes afterwards repetition of the stop period and biofilm flushing after three repetitive biofouling cycles led to a stable bacterial community the increase in bacterial community stability coincided with a decrease in cleaning effectivity to restore membrane performance this shows that membrane cleaning comes at the costs of a more stable bacterial community that is increasingly difficult to remove graphical abstracts graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords biofilm dispersal bacterial community flow velocity membrane biofouling membrane fouling simulator nutrient limitation 1 introduction membrane filtration is the leading technology for seawater purification gude 2016 one disadvantage is the inevitable accumulation of material at the membrane surface causing membrane fouling biofouling is the fouling type that most frequently diminishes membrane performance and leads to operational

are multicellular microbial aggregates surrounded by extracellular polymeric substances eps donlan and costerton 2002 when biofilms develop on synthetic membranes the eps layers add to the hydraulic resistance of the membrane and provides the embedded cells protection against chemical cleaning and nutrients after the chemical treatment flemming et al 1997 hijnen et al 2012 hence membrane

embedded cells can also disseminate actively from the biofilm in response to changes in the environment which is referred to as biofilm dispersion guilhen et al 2017 biofilm dispersion is always performed to stimulate surface colonization but its inducers can be either beneficial or harmful petrova and sauer 2016 in pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm dispersion can be induced by a sudden increase in glucose availability but also by glucose limitation hence biofilm dispersion is a complex process sauer et al 2004 schleheck et al 2009 to disperse from the biofilm bacteria increase their motility or secrete proteins that disrupt the integrity of the eps layer guilhen et al 2017 another way to disperse from the biofilm is via regulated cell lysis of a part of the community webb et al 2003 external factors that can trigger biofilm dispersal include amongst others nutrient limitation oxygen depletion hydrogen peroxide stress and concentration fluctuations of certain carbon sources guilhen et al 2017 recent studies have proposed that also signal molecules trigger biomass release from biofilms nagaraja et al 2017 xie et al 2019 nitric oxide is suggested to induce biofilm dispersal by modulating intracellular signal molecules but as free radical nitric oxide also causes oxidative damage to dna proteins and polysaccharides nagaraja et al 2017 xie et al 2019 these compounds therefore not only induce biofilm dispersal but also physically disassemble the eps layer dispersal of multispecies biofilms is understudied and it is unknown how these biofilms react to stimulants that disperse single species biofilms petrova and sauer 2016 the aim of this study was to examine the feasibility to remove membrane fouling caused by a multi species biofilm using nutrient limitation as a stimulant for biofilm dispersal nutrient depletion was achieved by stopping the flow of the feed water to untangle the biological e g dispersal from the mechanical e g flush impact we determined and compared the efficiency of biomass removal after different stop periods 4 min 24h and 4 weeks and with different flow velocities 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup three or four identical lab scale cross flow filtration cells with hydrodynamics similar to spiral wound nanofiltration nf and ro membrane elements were used to investigate membrane fouling for each flow cell an identical experimental design was applied to investigate membrane fouling under equivalent conditions figure s1 a detailed overview of the experimental setup is presented in the supplementary information 2 2 fouling simulation experiments three or four flow cells supplied with a polyethersulfone microfiltration membrane nominal pore size 0 05 µm nadir mp 005 microdyn nadir gmbh wiesbaden germany were operated simultaneously to investigate membrane biofouling control by stimulation of biofilm dispersal via nutrient limitation the flow rate of the retentate stream was measured by a calorimetric flowmeter omni fin honsberg remscheid germany and controlled using custom made flow controllers at a linear flow velocity of 0 1 m s 1 nutrients were dosed ahead of the filtration cells by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s pumps cole palmer instrument company vernon hills illinois usa figure s1 carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were dosed to a final concentration of 1 mg l 1 0 2 mg l 1

the netherlands was autoclaved after autoclaving the nutrient bottles were connected to the setup using a stainless steel connector swagelok waddinxveen the netherlands that was flamed before use to prevent microbial contamination of the nutrients after a minimum feed channel pressure drop fcp increase of 125 mbar the flow was stopped for either 4 min 24 h or 4 weeks the reasons for selecting these stop periods have been described in detail in the supplementary information after the stop period the membrane was flushed at a linear flow velocity of either 0 1 or 0 2 m s 1 table 1 as a reference we selected the flow cell with the lowest increase in fcp the fcp at the start of the experiment ranged between 80 and 110 mbar at initiation of the membrane flush a total of 250 ml of the retentate stream was collected in aliquots of 50 ml from each 50 ml aliquot 5 ml was used for total organic carbon toc measurement 10 ml for adenosine triphosphate atp content and the remaining 35 ml was used for dna extraction reduction in fcp hereafter referred to as pressure drop reduction pdr was used as a measure to determine membrane fouling control via biofilm dispersal 2 3 repeated membrane flushing we investigated how the efficiency to remove biomass after flow interruption periods and membrane flushing events was affected by repetition of these steps for all membranes used in the repeated flushing experiments duration of the stop period was 4 min and the linear flow velocity during flushing was either 0 1 m s 1 or 0 2 m s 1 table 1 for the experiments investigating the effect of repeated membrane flushes the experimental setup was operated as described in section 2 2 with the exception that for the repeated fouling and cleaning cycles the complete setup was cleaned before and after the experiment 2 4 total organic carbon toc and adenosine triphosphate atp determination a membrane autopsy was performed after membrane flushing for three times intermittingly fouled and cleaned membranes one autopsy was performed after the last cleaning step toc and atp measurements were performed as described before beyer et al 2014 2 5 membrane bacterial community composition bacterial genomic dna was extracted from fouled membrane biofilms and from membrane released biomass to perform 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing membranes were cut in pieces of 8 cm2 and placed in a 7 ml tube containing 6 ml of sterile milli q water these samples were bead beaten for 1 min at 50 000 rpm to dissolve the biomass and subsequently frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c after thawing dna was isolated using the power water dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca following manufacturer s instructions and visualised on a 1 agarose amplification of the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was performed using double barcoded primers covering the variable region v4 of the 16s rrna gene 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat caporaso et al 2011 ramiro garcia et al 2018 pcr amplification and amplicon quality check was performed as described before müller et al 2020 the resulting library was sent to gatc biotech ag now part of eurofins genomics germany gmbh konstanz germany for 2 150nt sequencing on an illumina hiseq2500 instrument sequence analysis was performed in ng tax 2 0 using default settings poncheewin et al 2019 in short paired end libraries were demultiplexed using read pairs with valid and perfectly matching barcodes amplicon sequence variants asv were picked as following sequences were ordered by abundance per sample and reads were considered valid when their cumulative abundance was 0 1 taxonomy was assigned using the silva reference database version 128 quast et al 2013 asvs are defined as individual sequence variants rather than a cluster of sequence variants with a shared similarity above a specified threshold generally 97 such as operational taxonomic units otu nucleotide sequences are available in the european nucleotide archive under accession number prjeb38042 2 6 statistical analysis for the bacterial communities all analyses were performed in r version 3 4 0 asv richness was calculated to define microbial alpha diversity within sample diversity for each sample as implemented in the vegan package oksanen et al 2018 beta diversity between sample diversity was calculated with bray curtis dissimilarity the asv level and principle coordinate analysis pcoa was used to visualize the resulting pairwise dissimilarity matrix bray and curtis 1957 data were normalized for the bar graphs into relative abundance for each sample by dividing the reads for each taxon by the total number of valid reads per sample without rarefaction because alpha diversity is independent of sequencing depth with ng tax 2 0 müller et al 2020 all plots were visualized using the ggplot2 package wickham 2016 3 results it is common practise to assess the effectivity of biofilm dispersal stimulants by determining the amount of released biomass after the liberated components have been removed by a flush to untangle the biological e g dispersal from the mechanical e g flush impact of this procedure we compared the biomass removal efficiency after different stop periods 4 min 24h and 4 weeks at the same flushing flow velocity and we assessed the biomass removal efficiency after the same stop periods at two different flow velocities in experiment i and ii the membranes were flushed at 0 1 m s 1 and in experiment iii and iv the membranes were flushed at 0 2 m s 1 table 1 in experiment v and vi the membranes were fouled and cleaned for three successive times to simulate the effect of repeated membrane cleaning an fcp increase of 125 mbar was used as criterion to start the stop period but due to the logarithmic biomass increase this criterion was frequently exceeded figure s2 s3 and s4 3 1 effect of different stop periods and flushing at 0 1 m s 1 3 1 1 biomass indicators atp measurements generally confirmed that elongation of the stop period led independent of the flow velocity to a decrease in microbial activity within the biofilm figure s5 during the membrane flush a total of 250 ml of the retentate stream was collected in aliquots of 50 ml toc was determined in each of the 5 aliquots and atp was measured in the first 50 ml aliquot when the membrane was flushed after a 4 min stop period the toc increased from 6 8 mg l 1 in the feed stream to 18 8 mg l 1 in the concentrate stream suggesting that biomass was released from the membrane fig 1 a for the second third fourth and fifth 50 ml aliquots of the retentate stream the toc was for each flow cell in each experiment comparable to the feed stream this suggests that most of the released biofilm is collected in the first 50 ml retentate stream fig 1a 1d 2 a 2d 3 a and 3b when the duration of the stop period was increased to 24h the amount of membrane released biomass feed 6 8 mg l 1 and concentrate 120 6 mg l 1 was substantially higher compared to the 4 min stop period these differences cannot be explained by the amount of biomass accumulated at the membrane surface which were comparable for the 4 min 158 3 ng cm 2 and 24 h 224 3 ng cm 2 stop period fig 1b the effect of a 4 min stop period was investigated as biological replicate while the stop period of 24h experiment i was exchanged for a 4 week stop period experiment ii fig 1d e and f although the amount of membrane accumulated toc was substantially higher for the 4 min stop period fig 1b toc of 158 2 ng cm 2 compared to its replicate fig 1e toc of 38 2 ng cm 2 the increase in fcp was slightly lower for the 4 min stop period figure s2 fcp of 168 mbar compared to its biological replicate fcp of 244 mbar for the 4 week stop period the difference between the biomass concentration in the feed 5 7 mg l 1 and retentate 30 6 mg l 1 fig 1d was lower compared to the 24h stop period fig 1a and indicated that not much more biomass was released from the membrane compared to the 4 min stop period feed 7 8 mg l 1 and retentate 19 6 mg l 1 fig 1d however the amount of biomass accumulated at the membrane surface was a factor 4 lower for the 4 week stop period 2 68 ng cm 2 fig 1e relative to the 4 min stop period 8 56 ng cm2 the toc and atp concentrations at the reference membrane were always the lowest because the flow cell with the lowest increase in fcp was selected as reference due to the chosen selection criteria 3 1 2 membrane performance fcp measurements showed that membrane performance was comparable for the flow cells per experiment but not between different experiments figure s2 s3 and s4 reduction in pdr was used as a measure to determine the membrane cleaning effect of the inflow stop and membrane flushing on membrane performance in experiment i the increase in membrane performance after the stop and flush event was considerably higher for the 4 min stop period fig 1c pdr of 22 5 relative to the 24h stop period fig 1c pdr of 6 5 but for membranes that were flushed at 0 1 m s 1 the stop period of 4 weeks fig 1f pdr of 32 7 gave the highest pressure drop reduction in experiment ii the 4 min stop period fig 1c pdr of 22 5 gave a higher increase in membrane performance compared to its biological replicate fig 1f pdr of 12 6 illustrating large differences between biological replicate experiments which agrees with the differences in the amount of accumulated toc between biological replicates fig 1b and 1e 3 2 effect of stop period and flushing at 0 2 m s 1 to determine the effect of biofilm sloughing e g mechanical biofilm removal on biomass removal and membrane performance recovery we repeated the fouling simulation experiments but increased the flow velocity during the membrane flush from 0 1 m s 1 to 0 2 m s 1 3 2 1 biomass indicators in experiment iii the toc concentration increased after the 4 min stop period from 4 8 mg l 1 in the feed to 22 6 mg l in the retentate fig 2a despite the fact that the amount of biomass accumulated at the membrane surface was slightly higher in experiment iv relative to experiment iii fig 2b and fig 2e the same stop period of 4 min gave a lower toc increase from 8 12 mg l 1 in the feed to 12 90 mg l 1 in the retentate fig 2d the toc increase after the 24h stop period was with 42 8 mg l 1 feed 6 2 mg l 1 and retentate 49 0 mg l 1 fig 2a higher compared to both 4 min stop periods but the 4 weeks stop period gave the highest biomass release 144 5 mg l 1 feed 6 4 mg l 1 and retentate 151 0 mg l 1 fig 2d 3 2 2 membrane performance irrespective of the stop period the recoveries in membrane performance were very comparable for the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 in experiment iii the 4 min stop period pdr of 50 4 gave a higher pdr compared to the 24h stop period pdr of 37 3 fig 2c similarly a stop period of 4 weeks pdr of 51 7 in experiment iv led to a comparable recovery of membrane performance relative to the biological replicate of the 4 min stop period pdr of 51 7 fig 2f 3 3 effect of repeated cleaning for membranes used in practise it becomes difficult over time to efficiently clean the membrane and restore their performance to the starting value beyer et al 2014 to investigate whether repeated cleaning by a stop and flush procedure leads to a more stable bacterial community membrane fouling and cleaning was performed for three consecutive times 3 3 1 biomass indicators after flushing at 0 1 m s 1 the toc concentrations of the first 50 ml of retentate increased for three distinct membranes to 17 7 ng l 1 33 4 ng l 1 and 13 20 ng l 1 fig 3a hence the amount of toc was slightly higher compared to the feed stream for two membranes i e 3 flushes and its technical duplicate 3 flushes duplicate membrane 3 and 4 the biofouling and cleaning steps were performed for three consecutive times during the second consecutive flush the toc concentrations of the first 50 ml aliquot ranged between 18 3 ng l 1 and 14 5 ng l 1 and for the third consecutive flush between 16 6 ng l 1 and 16 5 ng l 1 fig 3a the comparable amounts of toc released during the first second and third cleaning step suggests that the susceptibility of the membrane biofilm did not change throughout successive membrane fouling cycles generally more biomass was released from the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 fig 3b experiment vi indicating that flow velocity has a strong effect on the amount of released biomass during the first flush at 0 2 m s 1 the toc concentrations increased in the first 50 ml of retentate for the three membranes to 65 8 ng l 1 165 0 ng l 1 and 126 6 ng l 1 fig 3b during the second consecutive flush a comparable amount of biomass was released as the toc concentrations in the retentate stream increased to 139 4 ng l 1 and 218 0 ng l 1 fig 3b but during the third cleaning step the toc in the retentate stream was for both membranes substantially lower toc concentrations of 40 4 ng l 1 and 65 8 ng l 1 the amount of membrane attached biomass was comparable between experiment v and vi fig 3c 3d 3 3 2 membrane performance membrane performance was in line with the biomass measurements for the membranes flushed at 0 1 m s 1 the pdr values varied between 3 5 and 30 2 fig 4 a the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 showed higher pdr values ranging from 40 7 to 73 9 fig 4b these performance measurements confirm that flushing at 0 2 m s 1 instead of 0 1 m s 1 has a vast influence on the biomass removal efficiency the efficiency of the stop period and membrane flush to recover membrane performance was comparable for the first two cycles but the pdr of the third cycle was generally much lower fig 4 for the membranes flushed at 0 1 m s 1 this trend is less apparent but for the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 a clear trend can be distinguished for the latter the pdr values for the first and second cycle ranged from 71 6 to 73 0 but dropped to 43 5 for the third cycle fig 4b membrane 3 comparably for the second membrane repeatedly flushed at 0 2 m s 1 membrane 4 the pdr values for the first and second cycle changed from 74 0 to 70 4 and dropped to 40 7 for the third cycle 3 3 3 effect on the bacterial community composition for experiment v and vi 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was used to identify the bacterial community composition present on the membrane surface and in the retentate stream directly after each flush asv picking resulted in yielded 154 166 70 887 high quality reads per sample and an average of 37 asvs per sample table s1 for three randomly chosen samples replicate pcrs and sequencing was performed the high uniformity between each of the technical replicates illustrates that the ngs data is highly consistent figure s6 the most abundant taxa in all samples feed stream membrane attached biomass and retentate stream during flushing were mainly asv belonging to the family comamonadaceae and the genera acinetobacter ferribacterium flavobacterium and zoogloea fig 5 and 6 this close resemblance in bacterial community composition between feed and membrane suggests that the membrane surface does not select for specific bacterial taxa although the biofilms developing on the membranes that were flushed at a flow velocity of 0 1 m s 1 and 0 2 m s 1 were dominated by the same taxa acinetobacter appears to be generally more dominant in experiment v flushing at 0 1 m s 1 fig 5 while members from the comamonadaceae family appear to be generally more dominant in experiment vi flushing at 0 2 m s 1 fig 6 microbial alpha diversity defined as asv richness varied in experiment v for the detached biomass present in the retentate after flushing the membrane fig 7 a for the membranes that were flushed three consecutive times at 0 1 m s 1 richness of the detached biomass decreased between the first and second flush but increased between the second and third flush for the membranes that were flushed three consecutive times at 0 2 m s 1 detached biomass richness increased most substantially between the first and second flush after which the number of asvs decreased beta diversity between sample diversity based pcoa was used to visualise pairwise dissimilarity between samples where distance between samples is a proxy for community dissimilarity fig 8 bacterial communities of the detached biomass in experiment v clustered by membrane and were thus similar bacterial communities on membrane 3 and 4 were different from the detached biomass of the first second and third flush because these samples clustered together and were distant from the membrane attached communities fig 8a for experiment vi detached biomass communities clustered together with the membrane it originated from fig 8b in both experiment v and vi bacterial communities of membrane 1 which was used as reference and underwent no flushing event was most closely related to that of the feed water indicating that membrane flushing has an effect on bacterial community composition 4 discussion cleaning in place remains the only universal applicable method to control membrane bio fouling but it has major drawbacks such as loss of efficiency over time potential membrane damage the production of a waste stream and the co2 footprint of the applied chemicals application of biofilm dispersal for cleaning purposes in full scale membrane installations would most likely entail an increase in membrane modules to balance the likely gain in membrane downtime the stop period required to disperse a multispecies biofilm is therefore critical in determining the benefit of this cleaning method 4 1 effect of biofilm dispersal and membrane flushing at 0 1 m s 1 literature reports on different stop periods ranging from 5 minutes to several days to stimulate biofilm dispersal petrova and sauer 2016 as the eps layer serves as nutrient we postulate that nutrient limitation is enhanced by increasing the stop period duration this was supported by the atp concentrations of the membrane biomass which in general decreased with increasing stop periods figure s5 for the membranes that were flushed at 0 1 m s 1 it was shown that longer stop periods lead to more biomass removal fig 1a and fig 1d this indicates that like single species biofilms nutrient limitation is a stimulant for multispecies biofilm dispersal no correlation of biomass removal to membrane performance was found the large amount of toc that was removed after a 24h stop period was associated with a low pdr fig 1a and fig 1c for the stop period of 4 min and its biological replicate the toc present in the retentate after the flush were very similar respectively 18 8 mg l 1 and 19 6 mg l 1 fig 1a and 1d but resulted in deviating pdrs respectively 22 5 and 12 6 fig 1c and 1f this difference between biomass and membrane performance can be explained by development of flow channels on the membrane surface that form a passage for the feed between the accumulated biomass bucs et al 2014 radu et al 2014 no recovery in fcp is observed when biomass removal from the membrane does not widen the flow channels therefore biomass accumulation does not necessarily relates to membrane performance bucs et al 2014 another explanation that fits our observations is that the toc differences between the biological replicates was caused by the lack of a setup cleaning step between each of the first four experiments experiments i ii iii and iv because the setup was not cleaned bacteria that attach during the first experiment will colonize the setup during the experiment that follows while the entire setup will be colonized bacteria at the inlet side of setup will grow faster at the expense of the dosed nutrients in respect to the differential pressure meter when bacteria exclusively colonize the tubing at the inlet side this will lead to an increase in the feed channel pressure drop that erroneously may be explained as membrane fouling hence although the same performance criterion fcp increase of 125 mbar was used throughout the experiments the toc values declined from experiment i to iv because fouling of the setup contributed to the fcp increase this corroborates with the observations during the repeated cleaning experiments in 3 3 whereby the setup was cleaned between each experiment in these experiments the biomass indicator corresponds well with the membrane performance indicator 4 2 biofilm dispersal at different flow velocities to untangle the influence of mechanical biofilm detachment from biofilm dispersal we repeated the experiments but altered the flow velocity of the flush overall the increase in membrane performance was very similar for the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 fig 2c and 2f and consistently higher compared to the membranes flushed at 0 1 m s 1 fig 1c and 1f for the membranes flushed after a 4 min stop period the amount of membrane accumulated biomass was comparable for three membranes fig 1e 2b and 2e but was substantially higher for one membrane fig 1b in terms of biomass removal the differences between the 4 min stop period were comparable fig 1a 1d 2a and 2d and appeared therefore not to be affected by the flush flow velocity nor by the amount of membrane accumulated biomass during repeated fouling and cleaning cycles the stop period was the same but in contrast to the membranes that were cleaned once the different flow velocity led to large deviations both in terms of amount of removed biomass fig 3a and 3b as well as in membrane performance fig 4a and 4b these apparent discrepancies can be explained by differences in the amount of membrane accumulated biomass which was substantially lower for the membranes cleaned once fig 1b 1e 2b and 2e experiment i ii iii iv relative to the membranes cleaned three times fig 3c and 3d experiment v vi this low amount of membrane accumulated biomass might provide an alternative explanation why the biomass parameters could not be correlated to membrane performance for the membranes that were cleaned once fig 1 and 2 for the 24h stop period the amount of membrane accumulated biomass was a factor ten higher for the membrane flushed at 0 1 m s 1 fig 1b compared to the membrane flushed at 0 2 m s 1 fig 2b the amount of removed biomass for these membranes was around a factor two higher for the membrane flushed at 0 1 m s 1 fig 1a than those flushed at 0 2 m s 1 fig 2a hence although flushing at 0 1 m s 1 removed in absolute sense a higher amount of biomass when the amount of released biomass is compared to the amount of accumulated biomass it seems that flushing at 0 2 m s 1 is more effective in removing microbial aggregates these observations indicate that the flush flow velocity rather than the duration of the stop period has a substantial effect on the cleaning efficiency for the membranes flushed after a 4 week stop period the amount of accumulated biomass fig 1e and 2e was a factor 4 lower for the membrane flushed at 0 1 m s 1 relative to the membrane flushed at 0 2 m s 1 in comparison the amount of removed biomass was only a factor two lower for the membrane flushed at 0 1 m s 1 relative to the membrane flushed at 0 2 m s 1 this indicates that in contrast to the membranes stopped for 4 minutes and 24h for the 4 week stop period the stop period seems to strongly influence the amount of released biomass 4 3 biofilm dispersal to control membrane biofouling based on single species biofilm studies biofilm dispersal appears an attractive membrane cleaning strategy because no chemicals are required delaquis et al 1989 gjermansen et al 2005 guilhen et al 2017 petrova and sauer 2016 sauer et al 2004 the disadvantage of using stop periods is the demand for increased membrane surface area to counteract membrane downtime the results presented here indicate that multispecies biofilms can partly be removed using biofilm dispersal when flushed at 0 1 m s 1 the highest membrane cleaning efficiency of 32 7 was obtained after the longest stop period fig 1f in literature it has been reported that chemical cleaning with urea or a combination of urea with sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid leads to pdrs of 50 and 70 respectively sanawar et al 2018 this shows that membrane flushing at 0 1 m s 1 leads to small performance recoveries one factor to improve the cleaning efficiency is by increasing the flush flow velocity the highest pdr of 79 0 for the 0 2 m s 1 flush was obtained during the repeated fouling and cleaning cycle fig 4b these cleaning efficiencies exceed those of two stage cleaning using sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid but have to be considered within their experimental context as was illustrated here fig 2f and fig 4b the efficiency of membrane cleaning depends on the degree of membrane fouling higher pdrs are obtained at higher fcp increases figure s2 s3 and s4 there has not been much research performed on repeating membrane cleaning and whether this changes the membrane s efficiency the membrane cleaning efficiency at 0 2 m s 1 was very comparable between the first 72 and 74 and second 73 and 70 cleaning step but then declined with 30 to 44 and 41 fig 4b for the same membranes the relatively low amount of toc present in the retentate stream fig 3a 3b combined with the high amount of membrane attached biomass fig 3c and 3d suggests that cleaning repetition reduces cleaning efficiency 4 4 bacterial communities of fouled membranes the observed trend in asv richness of the released biomass a small decrease followed by a small increase shows that richness remained relatively stable for the membranes flushed at 0 1 m s 1 fig 7 this is in line with biomass indicators fig 3a and membrane performance fig 4a which showed that the removal efficiency was independent on the number of repetitions for the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 the small increase in asv richness fig 7 between the second and third flush corroborated with a low amount of released biomass fig 3b and low regain of membrane performance fig 4b hence for the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 the bacterial community became more stable during the consecutive cleaning and fouling cycles it is usually considered that biofilms growing under the same conditions show a high resemblance in bacterial community composition khan et al 2013 kim et al 2014 tan et al 2017 the flow cells used in this study were fed with the same feed water were dosed the same nutrients at the same flow velocity and had the same dimensions hence they were operated under identical conditions however 16s rrna amplicon sequencing showed that the bacterial assemblages differed substantially in composition fig 5 and 6 this lack of resemblance between biological replicates might be driven by the fact that phylogenetic diverse bacteria do share multiple functional traits such as being oligotrophic producing pili flagella and eps which equally aid their change of growth and survival on the membrane distinct bacterial groups may therefore prevail in the same environment barberán et al 2014 members from the orders burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales are frequently detected on fouled membranes de vries et al 2020 in the present study the family comamonadaceae and the genera acinetobacter ferribacterium flavobacterium and zoogloea were dominant taxa fig 5 and 6 this shows that from the frequently detected orders on fouled membranes members of the rhizobiales and sphingomonadales were below detection limit although they were abundant in the feed water the membranes used in present study deviate from membranes used in practise due to the addition of nutrients to the feed stream and the lack membrane cleaning events a recent study has shown that membrane cleaning efficiencies of lab scale and full scale experiments deviate substantially due to the differences in the chemical composition of the biofilms eps layer jafari et al 2020 at least for members of the sphingomonas genus it has been shown that their dominance on fouled membranes is due to membrane cleaning bereschenko et al 2010 for the other frequently detected orders i e burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales and xanthomonadales the same relation between abundance and being recalcitrant to membrane cleaning has been suggested al ashhab et al 2017 hong et al 2016 our results show that besides the influence of the chemical composition of the cleaning agents also the mechanical force of the membrane flush plays a pivotal role in selecting which bacterial taxa remain attached after the cleaning cycle this might provide an explanation for the results obtained by jafari et al 2020 the few studies that used cultivation dependent methods to characterize membrane isolated bacteria suggest that bacterial appendages flagella and pili eps composition metabolic plasticity and dissimilatory nitrate reduction are important physiological traits for membrane colonization de vries et al 2019 nagaraj et al 2019 pang et al 2005 pang and liu 2007 in line with these studies members of the comamonadaceae acinetobacter ferribacterium flavobacterium and zoogloea have shown to be flagellated and produce pili and many are able to reduce nitrogen or nitrate bernardet and bowman 2006 clemmer et al 2011 cummings et al 1999 shao et al 2009 4 5 biofilm dispersal of multispecies communities microscopic imaging has shown that dispersal of single species biofilms leads to almost complete removal of all attached biomass delaquis et al 1989 gjermansen et al 2005 schleheck et al 2009 thormann et al 2005 the high toc concentrations on the membrane surface after the membrane flush indicates that biomass removal of the multispecies biofilms was incomplete fig 1b 1e 2b 2e 3c 3d besides the technological approach used to illustrate biofilm dispersal there might be several other reasons to explain this apparent contradiction between pure culture studies and the results presented here on multispecies biofilms different species use different molecular mechanisms to disrupt a biofilm and have different abilities to remain surface attached under high hydrodynamic forces guilhen et al 2017 petrova and sauer 2016 another cause for the disagreement between single species biofilm dispersal and the results presented here might be the mechanical conditions on synthetic membranes the feed spacer is located on the membrane surface to separate two membrane sheets and stimulate mixing but its geometry creates positions with low shear forces where biofilm formation commonly starts circumstantially the feed spacer thus provides a physical barrier that renders membrane flushing less effective for biomass removal other studies have revealed that biofilms contain a basal layer that is more cohesive and denser than the outer biofilm layers abe et al 2012 paul et al 2012 stoodley et al 1998 this heterogeneity in cohesiveness within a biofilm might besides biofilm detachment also affect biofilm dispersal particularly for biofilms that develop under shear stress such as those on membranes the biofilms cohesion strength increases as it becomes compressed by the flow paul et al 2012 5 conclusions in full scale membrane filtration installations biofilm dispersal would at the costs of additional membranes and membrane downtime provide an economic and eco friendly alternative for cleaning in place this study shows that biomass removal after a stop period has a biological and mechanical cause and uncovers that more biomass can be removed by increasing the flow velocity of the flush but after repeated cleaning cycles this leads to a stable and

17009,pure culture studies have shown that biofilm dispersal can be triggered if the nutrient supply is discontinued by stopping the flow stimulating biofilm dispersal in this manner would provide a sustainable manner to control unwanted biofilm growth in industrial settings for instance on synthetic membranes used to purify water the response of multispecies biofilms to nutrient limitation has not been thoroughly studied to assess biomass dispersal during nutrient limitation it is common practise to flush the biofilm after a stop period hence flow stop induced biomass removal could occur as a response to nutrient limitation followed by mechanical removal due to biofilm flushing e g biofilm detachment here we investigated the feasibility to reduce membrane biofouling by stopping the flow and flushing the membrane using a membrane fouling simulator biomass removal from synthetic membranes after different stop periods was determined as well as biomass removal at different cross flow velocities biomass removal from membrane surfaces depended on the nutrient limiting period and on the flow velocity during the biofilm flush when flushed at a low flow velocity 0 1 m s 1 the duration of the stop period had a large effect on the biomass removal rate but when the flow velocity was increased to 0 2 m s 1 the length of the stop period became less considerable the flow velocity during membrane flushing has an effect on the bacterial community that colonized the membranes afterwards repetition of the stop period and biofilm flushing after three repetitive biofouling cycles led to a stable bacterial community the increase in bacterial community stability coincided with a decrease in cleaning effectivity to restore membrane performance this shows that membrane cleaning comes at the costs of a more stable bacterial community that is increasingly difficult to remove graphical abstracts graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords biofilm dispersal bacterial community flow velocity membrane biofouling membrane fouling simulator nutrient limitation 1 introduction membrane filtration is the leading technology for seawater purification gude 2016 one disadvantage is the inevitable accumulation of material at the membrane surface causing membrane fouling biofouling is the fouling type that most frequently diminishes membrane performance and leads to operational problems such as an increase in pressure drop decrease in normalized flux and altered membrane selectivity nguyen et al 2012 for reverse osmosis ro membranes fouling removal is limited to chemical based cleaning in place microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf membranes are also cleaned physically via forward flush backflush pneumatic cleaning by gases or by applying ultrasound or electrical fields regula et al 2014 despite these alternatives cleaning in place is the only option for mf and uf membranes to remove recalcitrant fouling components such as proteins maskooki et al 2010 biofilms are multicellular microbial aggregates surrounded by extracellular polymeric substances eps donlan and costerton 2002 when biofilms develop on synthetic membranes the eps layers add to the hydraulic resistance of the membrane and provides the embedded cells protection against chemical cleaning and nutrients after the chemical treatment flemming et al 1997 hijnen et al 2012 hence membrane biofouling is a biofilm problem flemming et al 1997 three biofilm removal mechanisms can be distinguished desorption detachment and dispersal petrova and sauer 2016 desorption is the reverse of bacterial attachment e g surface attached cells leave the substratum to enter the bulk liquid detachment describes the process in which biofilm embedded cells dislocate passively from the biofilm this occurs when external forces disrupt the biofilm structure two examples are sloughing via frictional fluid forces and grazing by eukaryotic consumption klein et al 2016 petrova and sauer 2016 biofilm embedded cells can also disseminate actively from the biofilm in response to changes in the environment which is referred to as biofilm dispersion guilhen et al 2017 biofilm dispersion is always performed to stimulate surface colonization but its inducers can be either beneficial or harmful petrova and sauer 2016 in pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm dispersion can be induced by a sudden increase in glucose availability but also by glucose limitation hence biofilm dispersion is a complex process sauer et al 2004 schleheck et al 2009 to disperse from the biofilm bacteria increase their motility or secrete proteins that disrupt the integrity of the eps layer guilhen et al 2017 another way to disperse from the biofilm is via regulated cell lysis of a part of the community webb et al 2003 external factors that can trigger biofilm dispersal include amongst others nutrient limitation oxygen depletion hydrogen peroxide stress and concentration fluctuations of certain carbon sources guilhen et al 2017 recent studies have proposed that also signal molecules trigger biomass release from biofilms nagaraja et al 2017 xie et al 2019 nitric oxide is suggested to induce biofilm dispersal by modulating intracellular signal molecules but as free radical nitric oxide also causes oxidative damage to dna proteins and polysaccharides nagaraja et al 2017 xie et al 2019 these compounds therefore not only induce biofilm dispersal but also physically disassemble the eps layer dispersal of multispecies biofilms is understudied and it is unknown how these biofilms react to stimulants that disperse single species biofilms petrova and sauer 2016 the aim of this study was to examine the feasibility to remove membrane fouling caused by a multi species biofilm using nutrient limitation as a stimulant for biofilm dispersal nutrient depletion was achieved by stopping the flow of the feed water to untangle the biological e g dispersal from the mechanical e g flush impact we determined and compared the efficiency of biomass removal after different stop periods 4 min 24h and 4 weeks and with different flow velocities 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup three or four identical lab scale cross flow filtration cells with hydrodynamics similar to spiral wound nanofiltration nf and ro membrane elements were used to investigate membrane fouling for each flow cell an identical experimental design was applied to investigate membrane fouling under equivalent conditions figure s1 a detailed overview of the experimental setup is presented in the supplementary information 2 2 fouling simulation experiments three or four flow cells supplied with a polyethersulfone microfiltration membrane nominal pore size 0 05 µm nadir mp 005 microdyn nadir gmbh wiesbaden germany were operated simultaneously to investigate membrane biofouling control by stimulation of biofilm dispersal via nutrient limitation the flow rate of the retentate stream was measured by a calorimetric flowmeter omni fin honsberg remscheid germany and controlled using custom made flow controllers at a linear flow velocity of 0 1 m s 1 nutrients were dosed ahead of the filtration cells by a peristaltic pump masterflex l s pumps cole palmer instrument company vernon hills illinois usa figure s1 carbon nitrogen and phosphorus were dosed to a final concentration of 1 mg l 1 0 2 mg l 1

the netherlands was autoclaved after autoclaving the nutrient bottles were connected to the setup using a stainless steel connector swagelok waddinxveen the netherlands that was flamed before use to prevent microbial contamination of the nutrients after a minimum feed channel pressure drop fcp increase of 125 mbar the flow was stopped for either 4 min 24 h or 4 weeks the reasons for selecting these stop periods have been described in detail in the supplementary information after the stop period the membrane was flushed at a linear flow velocity of either 0 1 or 0 2 m s 1 table 1 as a reference we selected the flow cell with the lowest increase in fcp the fcp at the start of the experiment ranged between 80 and 110 mbar at initiation of the membrane flush a total of 250 ml of the retentate stream was collected in aliquots of 50 ml from each 50 ml aliquot 5 ml was used for total organic carbon toc measurement 10 ml for adenosine triphosphate atp content and the remaining 35 ml was used for dna extraction reduction in fcp hereafter referred to as pressure drop reduction pdr was used as a measure to determine membrane fouling control via biofilm dispersal 2 3 repeated membrane flushing we investigated how the efficiency to remove biomass after flow interruption periods and membrane flushing events was affected by repetition of these steps for all membranes used in the repeated flushing experiments duration of the stop period was 4 min and the linear flow velocity during flushing was either 0 1 m s 1 or 0 2 m s 1 table 1 for the experiments investigating the effect of repeated membrane flushes the experimental setup was operated as described in section 2 2 with the exception that for the repeated fouling and cleaning cycles the complete setup was cleaned before and after the experiment 2 4 total organic carbon toc and adenosine triphosphate atp determination a membrane autopsy was performed after membrane flushing for three times intermittingly fouled and cleaned membranes one autopsy was performed after the last cleaning step toc and atp measurements were performed as described before beyer et al 2014 2 5 membrane bacterial community composition bacterial genomic dna was extracted from fouled membrane biofilms and from membrane released biomass to perform 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing membranes were cut in pieces of 8 cm2 and placed in a 7 ml tube containing 6 ml of sterile milli q water these samples were bead beaten for 1 min at 50 000 rpm to dissolve the biomass and subsequently frozen using liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c after thawing dna was isolated using the power water dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc carlsbad ca following manufacturer s instructions and visualised on a 1 agarose amplification of the v4 region of the 16s rrna gene was performed using double barcoded primers covering the variable region v4 of the 16s rrna gene 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat caporaso et al 2011 ramiro garcia et al 2018 pcr amplification and amplicon quality check was performed as described before müller et al 2020 the resulting library was sent to gatc biotech ag now part of eurofins genomics germany gmbh konstanz germany for 2 150nt sequencing on an illumina hiseq2500 instrument sequence analysis was performed in ng tax 2 0 using default settings poncheewin et al 2019 in short paired end libraries were demultiplexed using read pairs with valid and perfectly matching barcodes amplicon sequence variants asv were picked as following sequences were ordered by abundance per sample and reads were considered valid when their cumulative abundance was 0 1 taxonomy was assigned using the silva reference database version 128 quast et al 2013 asvs are defined as individual sequence variants rather than a cluster of sequence variants with a shared similarity above a specified threshold generally 97 such as operational taxonomic units otu nucleotide sequences are available in the european nucleotide archive under accession number prjeb38042 2 6 statistical analysis for the bacterial communities all analyses were performed in r version 3 4 0 asv richness was calculated to define microbial alpha diversity within sample diversity for each sample as implemented in the vegan package oksanen et al 2018 beta diversity between sample diversity was calculated with bray curtis dissimilarity the asv level and principle coordinate analysis pcoa was used to visualize the resulting pairwise dissimilarity matrix bray and curtis 1957 data were normalized for the bar graphs into relative abundance for each sample by dividing the reads for each taxon by the total number of valid reads per sample without rarefaction because alpha diversity is independent of sequencing depth with ng tax 2 0 müller et al 2020 all plots were visualized using the ggplot2 package wickham 2016 3 results it is common practise to assess the effectivity of biofilm dispersal stimulants by determining the amount of released biomass after the liberated components have been removed by a flush to untangle the biological e g dispersal from the mechanical e g flush impact of this procedure we compared the biomass removal efficiency after different stop periods 4 min 24h and 4 weeks at the same flushing flow velocity and we assessed the biomass removal efficiency after the same stop periods at two different flow velocities in experiment i and ii the membranes were flushed at 0 1 m s 1 and in experiment iii and iv the membranes were flushed at 0 2 m s 1 table 1 in experiment v and vi the membranes were fouled and cleaned for three successive times to simulate the effect of repeated membrane cleaning an fcp increase of 125 mbar was used as criterion to start the stop period but due to the logarithmic biomass increase this criterion was frequently exceeded figure s2 s3 and s4 3 1 effect of different stop periods and flushing at 0 1 m s 1 3 1 1 biomass indicators atp measurements generally confirmed that elongation of the stop period led independent of the flow velocity to a decrease in microbial activity within the biofilm figure s5 during the membrane flush a total of 250 ml of the retentate stream was collected in aliquots of 50 ml toc was determined in each of the 5 aliquots and atp was measured in the first 50 ml aliquot when the membrane was flushed after a 4 min stop period the toc increased from 6 8 mg l 1 in the feed stream to 18 8 mg l 1 in the concentrate stream suggesting that biomass was released from the membrane fig 1 a for the second third fourth and fifth 50 ml aliquots of the retentate stream the toc was for each flow cell in each experiment comparable to the feed stream this suggests that most of the released biofilm is collected in the first 50 ml retentate stream fig 1a 1d 2 a 2d 3 a and 3b when the duration of the stop period was increased to 24h the amount of membrane released biomass feed 6 8 mg l 1 and concentrate 120 6 mg l 1 was substantially higher compared to the 4 min stop period these differences cannot be explained by the amount of biomass accumulated at the membrane surface which were comparable for the 4 min 158 3 ng cm 2 and 24 h 224 3 ng cm 2 stop period fig 1b the effect of a 4 min stop period was investigated as biological replicate while the stop period of 24h experiment i was exchanged for a 4 week stop period experiment ii fig 1d e and f although the amount of membrane accumulated toc was substantially higher for the 4 min stop period fig 1b toc of 158 2 ng cm 2 compared to its replicate fig 1e toc of 38 2 ng cm 2 the increase in fcp was slightly lower for the 4 min stop period figure s2 fcp of 168 mbar compared to its biological replicate fcp of 244 mbar for the 4 week stop period the difference between the biomass concentration in the feed 5 7 mg l 1 and retentate 30 6 mg l 1 fig 1d was lower compared to the 24h stop period fig 1a and indicated that not much more biomass was released from the membrane compared to the 4 min stop period feed 7 8 mg l 1 and retentate 19 6 mg l 1 fig 1d however the amount of biomass accumulated at the membrane surface was a factor 4 lower for the 4 week stop period 2 68 ng cm 2 fig 1e relative to the 4 min stop period 8 56 ng cm2 the toc and atp concentrations at the reference membrane were always the lowest because the flow cell with the lowest increase in fcp was selected as reference due to the chosen selection criteria 3 1 2 membrane performance fcp measurements showed that membrane performance was comparable for the flow cells per experiment but not between different experiments figure s2 s3 and s4 reduction in pdr was used as a measure to determine the membrane cleaning effect of the inflow stop and membrane flushing on membrane performance in experiment i the increase in membrane performance after the stop and flush event was considerably higher for the 4 min stop period fig 1c pdr of 22 5 relative to the 24h stop period fig 1c pdr of 6 5 but for membranes that were flushed at 0 1 m s 1 the stop period of 4 weeks fig 1f pdr of 32 7 gave the highest pressure drop reduction in experiment ii the 4 min stop period fig 1c pdr of 22 5 gave a higher increase in membrane performance compared to its biological replicate fig 1f pdr of 12 6 illustrating large differences between biological replicate experiments which agrees with the differences in the amount of accumulated toc between biological replicates fig 1b and 1e 3 2 effect of stop period and flushing at 0 2 m s 1 to determine the effect of biofilm sloughing e g mechanical biofilm removal on biomass removal and membrane performance recovery we repeated the fouling simulation experiments but increased the flow velocity during the membrane flush from 0 1 m s 1 to 0 2 m s 1 3 2 1 biomass indicators in experiment iii the toc concentration increased after the 4 min stop period from 4 8 mg l 1 in the feed to 22 6 mg l in the retentate fig 2a despite the fact that the amount of biomass accumulated at the membrane surface was slightly higher in experiment iv relative to experiment iii fig 2b and fig 2e the same stop period of 4 min gave a lower toc increase from 8 12 mg l 1 in the feed to 12 90 mg l 1 in the retentate fig 2d the toc increase after the 24h stop period was with 42 8 mg l 1 feed 6 2 mg l 1 and retentate 49 0 mg l 1 fig 2a higher compared to both 4 min stop periods but the 4 weeks stop period gave the highest biomass release 144 5 mg l 1 feed 6 4 mg l 1 and retentate 151 0 mg l 1 fig 2d 3 2 2 membrane performance irrespective of the stop period the recoveries in membrane performance were very comparable for the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 in experiment iii the 4 min stop period pdr of 50 4 gave a higher pdr compared to the 24h stop period pdr of 37 3 fig 2c similarly a stop period of 4 weeks pdr of 51 7 in experiment iv led to a comparable recovery of membrane performance relative to the biological replicate of the 4 min stop period pdr of 51 7 fig 2f 3 3 effect of repeated cleaning for membranes used in practise it becomes difficult over time to efficiently clean the membrane and restore their performance to the starting value beyer et al 2014 to investigate whether repeated cleaning by a stop and flush procedure leads to a more stable bacterial community membrane fouling and cleaning was performed for three consecutive times 3 3 1 biomass indicators after flushing at 0 1 m s 1 the toc concentrations of the first 50 ml of retentate increased for three distinct membranes to 17 7 ng l 1 33 4 ng l 1 and 13 20 ng l 1 fig 3a hence the amount of toc was slightly higher compared to the feed stream for two membranes i e 3 flushes and its technical duplicate 3 flushes duplicate membrane 3 and 4 the biofouling and cleaning steps were performed for three consecutive times during the second consecutive flush the toc concentrations of the first 50 ml aliquot ranged between 18 3 ng l 1 and 14 5 ng l 1 and for the third consecutive flush between 16 6 ng l 1 and 16 5 ng l 1 fig 3a the comparable amounts of toc released during the first second and third cleaning step suggests that the susceptibility of the membrane biofilm did not change throughout successive membrane fouling cycles generally more biomass was released from the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 fig 3b experiment vi indicating that flow velocity has a strong effect on the amount of released biomass during the first flush at 0 2 m s 1 the toc concentrations increased in the first 50 ml of retentate for the three membranes to 65 8 ng l 1 165 0 ng l 1 and 126 6 ng l 1 fig 3b during the second consecutive flush a comparable amount of biomass was released as the toc concentrations in the retentate stream increased to 139 4 ng l 1 and 218 0 ng l 1 fig 3b but during the third cleaning step the toc in the retentate stream was for both membranes substantially lower toc concentrations of 40 4 ng l 1 and 65 8 ng l 1 the amount of membrane attached biomass was comparable between experiment v and vi fig 3c 3d 3 3 2 membrane performance membrane performance was in line with the biomass measurements for the membranes flushed at 0 1 m s 1 the pdr values varied between 3 5 and 30 2 fig 4 a the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 showed higher pdr values ranging from 40 7 to 73 9 fig 4b these performance measurements confirm that flushing at 0 2 m s 1 instead of 0 1 m s 1 has a vast influence on the biomass removal efficiency the efficiency of the stop period and membrane flush to recover membrane performance was comparable for the first two cycles but the pdr of the third cycle was generally much lower fig 4 for the membranes flushed at 0 1 m s 1 this trend is less apparent but for the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 a clear trend can be distinguished for the latter the pdr values for the first and second cycle ranged from 71 6 to 73 0 but dropped to 43 5 for the third cycle fig 4b membrane 3 comparably for the second membrane repeatedly flushed at 0 2 m s 1 membrane 4 the pdr values for the first and second cycle changed from 74 0 to 70 4 and dropped to 40 7 for the third cycle 3 3 3 effect on the bacterial community composition for experiment v and vi 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing was used to identify the bacterial community composition present on the membrane surface and in the retentate stream directly after each flush asv picking resulted in yielded 154 166 70 887 high quality reads per sample and an average of 37 asvs per sample table s1 for three randomly chosen samples replicate pcrs and sequencing was performed the high uniformity between each of the technical replicates illustrates that the ngs data is highly consistent figure s6 the most abundant taxa in all samples feed stream membrane attached biomass and retentate stream during flushing were mainly asv belonging to the family comamonadaceae and the genera acinetobacter ferribacterium flavobacterium and zoogloea fig 5 and 6 this close resemblance in bacterial community composition between feed and membrane suggests that the membrane surface does not select for specific bacterial taxa although the biofilms developing on the membranes that were flushed at a flow velocity of 0 1 m s 1 and 0 2 m s 1 were dominated by the same taxa acinetobacter appears to be generally more dominant in experiment v flushing at 0 1 m s 1 fig 5 while members from the comamonadaceae family appear to be generally more dominant in experiment vi flushing at 0 2 m s 1 fig 6 microbial alpha diversity defined as asv richness varied in experiment v for the detached biomass present in the retentate after flushing the membrane fig 7 a for the membranes that were flushed three consecutive times at 0 1 m s 1 richness of the detached biomass decreased between the first and second flush but increased between the second and third flush for the membranes that were flushed three consecutive times at 0 2 m s 1 detached biomass richness increased most substantially between the first and second flush after which the number of asvs decreased beta diversity between sample diversity based pcoa was used to visualise pairwise dissimilarity between samples where distance between samples is a proxy for community dissimilarity fig 8 bacterial communities of the detached biomass in experiment v clustered by membrane and were thus similar bacterial communities on membrane 3 and 4 were different from the detached biomass of the first second and third flush because these samples clustered together and were distant from the membrane attached communities fig 8a for experiment vi detached biomass communities clustered together with the membrane it originated from fig 8b in both experiment v and vi bacterial communities of membrane 1 which was used as reference and underwent no flushing event was most closely related to that of the feed water indicating that membrane flushing has an effect on bacterial community composition 4 discussion cleaning in place remains the only universal applicable method to control membrane bio fouling but it has major drawbacks such as loss of efficiency over time potential membrane damage the production of a waste stream and the co2 footprint of the applied chemicals application of biofilm dispersal for cleaning purposes in full scale membrane installations would most likely entail an increase in membrane modules to balance the likely gain in membrane downtime the stop period required to disperse a multispecies biofilm is therefore critical in determining the benefit of this cleaning method 4 1 effect of biofilm dispersal and membrane flushing at 0 1 m s 1 literature reports on different stop periods ranging from 5 minutes to several days to stimulate biofilm dispersal petrova and sauer 2016 as the eps layer serves as nutrient we postulate that nutrient limitation is enhanced by increasing the stop period duration this was supported by the atp concentrations of the membrane biomass which in general decreased with increasing stop periods figure s5 for the membranes that were flushed at 0 1 m s 1 it was shown that longer stop periods lead to more biomass removal fig 1a and fig 1d this indicates that like single species biofilms nutrient limitation is a stimulant for multispecies biofilm dispersal no correlation of biomass removal to membrane performance was found the large amount of toc that was removed after a 24h stop period was associated with a low pdr fig 1a and fig 1c for the stop period of 4 min and its biological replicate the toc present in the retentate after the flush were very similar respectively 18 8 mg l 1 and 19 6 mg l 1 fig 1a and 1d but resulted in deviating pdrs respectively 22 5 and 12 6 fig 1c and 1f this difference between biomass and membrane performance can be explained by development of flow channels on the membrane surface that form a passage for the feed between the accumulated biomass bucs et al 2014 radu et al 2014 no recovery in fcp is observed when biomass removal from the membrane does not widen the flow channels therefore biomass accumulation does not necessarily relates to membrane performance bucs et al 2014 another explanation that fits our observations is that the toc differences between the biological replicates was caused by the lack of a setup cleaning step between each of the first four experiments experiments i ii iii and iv because the setup was not cleaned bacteria that attach during the first experiment will colonize the setup during the experiment that follows while the entire setup will be colonized bacteria at the inlet side of setup will grow faster at the expense of the dosed nutrients in respect to the differential pressure meter when bacteria exclusively colonize the tubing at the inlet side this will lead to an increase in the feed channel pressure drop that erroneously may be explained as membrane fouling hence although the same performance criterion fcp increase of 125 mbar was used throughout the experiments the toc values declined from experiment i to iv because fouling of the setup contributed to the fcp increase this corroborates with the observations during the repeated cleaning experiments in 3 3 whereby the setup was cleaned between each experiment in these experiments the biomass indicator corresponds well with the membrane performance indicator 4 2 biofilm dispersal at different flow velocities to untangle the influence of mechanical biofilm detachment from biofilm dispersal we repeated the experiments but altered the flow velocity of the flush overall the increase in membrane performance was very similar for the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 fig 2c and 2f and consistently higher compared to the membranes flushed at 0 1 m s 1 fig 1c and 1f for the membranes flushed after a 4 min stop period the amount of membrane accumulated biomass was comparable for three membranes fig 1e 2b and 2e but was substantially higher for one membrane fig 1b in terms of biomass removal the differences between the 4 min stop period were comparable fig 1a 1d 2a and 2d and appeared therefore not to be affected by the flush flow velocity nor by the amount of membrane accumulated biomass during repeated fouling and cleaning cycles the stop period was the same but in contrast to the membranes that were cleaned once the different flow velocity led to large deviations both in terms of amount of removed biomass fig 3a and 3b as well as in membrane performance fig 4a and 4b these apparent discrepancies can be explained by differences in the amount of membrane accumulated biomass which was substantially lower for the membranes cleaned once fig 1b 1e 2b and 2e experiment i ii iii iv relative to the membranes cleaned three times fig 3c and 3d experiment v vi this low amount of membrane accumulated biomass might provide an alternative explanation why the biomass parameters could not be correlated to membrane performance for the membranes that were cleaned once fig 1 and 2 for the 24h stop period the amount of membrane accumulated biomass was a factor ten higher for the membrane flushed at 0 1 m s 1 fig 1b compared to the membrane flushed at 0 2 m s 1 fig 2b the amount of removed biomass for these membranes was around a factor two higher for the membrane flushed at 0 1 m s 1 fig 1a than those flushed at 0 2 m s 1 fig 2a hence although flushing at 0 1 m s 1 removed in absolute sense a higher amount of biomass when the amount of released biomass is compared to the amount of accumulated biomass it seems that flushing at 0 2 m s 1 is more effective in removing microbial aggregates these observations indicate that the flush flow velocity rather than the duration of the stop period has a substantial effect on the cleaning efficiency for the membranes flushed after a 4 week stop period the amount of accumulated biomass fig 1e and 2e was a factor 4 lower for the membrane flushed at 0 1 m s 1 relative to the membrane flushed at 0 2 m s 1 in comparison the amount of removed biomass was only a factor two lower for the membrane flushed at 0 1 m s 1 relative to the membrane flushed at 0 2 m s 1 this indicates that in contrast to the membranes stopped for 4 minutes and 24h for the 4 week stop period the stop period seems to strongly influence the amount of released biomass 4 3 biofilm dispersal to control membrane biofouling based on single species biofilm studies biofilm dispersal appears an attractive membrane cleaning strategy because no chemicals are required delaquis et al 1989 gjermansen et al 2005 guilhen et al 2017 petrova and sauer 2016 sauer et al 2004 the disadvantage of using stop periods is the demand for increased membrane surface area to counteract membrane downtime the results presented here indicate that multispecies biofilms can partly be removed using biofilm dispersal when flushed at 0 1 m s 1 the highest membrane cleaning efficiency of 32 7 was obtained after the longest stop period fig 1f in literature it has been reported that chemical cleaning with urea or a combination of urea with sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid leads to pdrs of 50 and 70 respectively sanawar et al 2018 this shows that membrane flushing at 0 1 m s 1 leads to small performance recoveries one factor to improve the cleaning efficiency is by increasing the flush flow velocity the highest pdr of 79 0 for the 0 2 m s 1 flush was obtained during the repeated fouling and cleaning cycle fig 4b these cleaning efficiencies exceed those of two stage cleaning using sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid but have to be considered within their experimental context as was illustrated here fig 2f and fig 4b the efficiency of membrane cleaning depends on the degree of membrane fouling higher pdrs are obtained at higher fcp increases figure s2 s3 and s4 there has not been much research performed on repeating membrane cleaning and whether this changes the membrane s efficiency the membrane cleaning efficiency at 0 2 m s 1 was very comparable between the first 72 and 74 and second 73 and 70 cleaning step but then declined with 30 to 44 and 41 fig 4b for the same membranes the relatively low amount of toc present in the retentate stream fig 3a 3b combined with the high amount of membrane attached biomass fig 3c and 3d suggests that cleaning repetition reduces cleaning efficiency 4 4 bacterial communities of fouled membranes the observed trend in asv richness of the released biomass a small decrease followed by a small increase shows that richness remained relatively stable for the membranes flushed at 0 1 m s 1 fig 7 this is in line with biomass indicators fig 3a and membrane performance fig 4a which showed that the removal efficiency was independent on the number of repetitions for the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 the small increase in asv richness fig 7 between the second and third flush corroborated with a low amount of released biomass fig 3b and low regain of membrane performance fig 4b hence for the membranes flushed at 0 2 m s 1 the bacterial community became more stable during the consecutive cleaning and fouling cycles it is usually considered that biofilms growing under the same conditions show a high resemblance in bacterial community composition khan et al 2013 kim et al 2014 tan et al 2017 the flow cells used in this study were fed with the same feed water were dosed the same nutrients at the same flow velocity and had the same dimensions hence they were operated under identical conditions however 16s rrna amplicon sequencing showed that the bacterial assemblages differed substantially in composition fig 5 and 6 this lack of resemblance between biological replicates might be driven by the fact that phylogenetic diverse bacteria do share multiple functional traits such as being oligotrophic producing pili flagella and eps which equally aid their change of growth and survival on the membrane distinct bacterial groups may therefore prevail in the same environment barberán et al 2014 members from the orders burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales sphingomonadales and xanthomonadales are frequently detected on fouled membranes de vries et al 2020 in the present study the family comamonadaceae and the genera acinetobacter ferribacterium flavobacterium and zoogloea were dominant taxa fig 5 and 6 this shows that from the frequently detected orders on fouled membranes members of the rhizobiales and sphingomonadales were below detection limit although they were abundant in the feed water the membranes used in present study deviate from membranes used in practise due to the addition of nutrients to the feed stream and the lack membrane cleaning events a recent study has shown that membrane cleaning efficiencies of lab scale and full scale experiments deviate substantially due to the differences in the chemical composition of the biofilms eps layer jafari et al 2020 at least for members of the sphingomonas genus it has been shown that their dominance on fouled membranes is due to membrane cleaning bereschenko et al 2010 for the other frequently detected orders i e burkholderiales pseudomonadales rhizobiales and xanthomonadales the same relation between abundance and being recalcitrant to membrane cleaning has been suggested al ashhab et al 2017 hong et al 2016 our results show that besides the influence of the chemical composition of the cleaning agents also the mechanical force of the membrane flush plays a pivotal role in selecting which bacterial taxa remain attached after the cleaning cycle this might provide an explanation for the results obtained by jafari et al 2020 the few studies that used cultivation dependent methods to characterize membrane isolated bacteria suggest that bacterial appendages flagella and pili eps composition metabolic plasticity and dissimilatory nitrate reduction are important physiological traits for membrane colonization de vries et al 2019 nagaraj et al 2019 pang et al 2005 pang and liu 2007 in line with these studies members of the comamonadaceae acinetobacter ferribacterium flavobacterium and zoogloea have shown to be flagellated and produce pili and many are able to reduce nitrogen or nitrate bernardet and bowman 2006 clemmer et al 2011 cummings et al 1999 shao et al 2009 4 5 biofilm dispersal of multispecies communities microscopic imaging has shown that dispersal of single species biofilms leads to almost complete removal of all attached biomass delaquis et al 1989 gjermansen et al 2005 schleheck et al 2009 thormann et al 2005 the high toc concentrations on the membrane surface after the membrane flush indicates that biomass removal of the multispecies biofilms was incomplete fig 1b 1e 2b 2e 3c 3d besides the technological approach used to illustrate biofilm dispersal there might be several other reasons to explain this apparent contradiction between pure culture studies and the results presented here on multispecies biofilms different species use different molecular mechanisms to disrupt a biofilm and have different abilities to remain surface attached under high hydrodynamic forces guilhen et al 2017 petrova and sauer 2016 another cause for the disagreement between single species biofilm dispersal and the results presented here might be the mechanical conditions on synthetic membranes the feed spacer is located on the membrane surface to separate two membrane sheets and stimulate mixing but its geometry creates positions with low shear forces where biofilm formation commonly starts circumstantially the feed spacer thus provides a physical barrier that renders membrane flushing less effective for biomass removal other studies have revealed that biofilms contain a basal layer that is more cohesive and denser than the outer biofilm layers abe et al 2012 paul et al 2012 stoodley et al 1998 this heterogeneity in cohesiveness within a biofilm might besides biofilm detachment also affect biofilm dispersal particularly for biofilms that develop under shear stress such as those on membranes the biofilms cohesion strength increases as it becomes compressed by the flow paul et al 2012 5 conclusions in full scale membrane filtration installations biofilm dispersal would at the costs of additional membranes and membrane downtime provide an economic and eco friendly alternative for cleaning in place this study shows that biomass removal after a stop period has a biological and mechanical cause and uncovers that more biomass can be removed by increasing the flow velocity of the flush but after repeated cleaning cycles this leads to a stable and resilient bacterial community on the membrane 7 author contributions section h j d v p v d b and c m p designed the study e k performed the experiments h j d v p v d b g d a h and e k analyzed the
