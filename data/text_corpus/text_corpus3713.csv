18565,complexing anions such as phosphate or silicate play an ambivalent role in the performance of hydrolyzing metal coagulants on one hand they significantly interfere with the hydrolytic pathway of conventional iron or aluminum coagulants the associated destabilization mechanism remaining rather elusive on the other hand they have been shown to be key ingredients in the formulation of innovative coagulant solutions exhibiting improved removal efficiency their action mechanism at the molecular scale being presently poorly understood in this paper we explore the effect of small additions of phosphate ligand on the chemical coagulation of silica nanoparticles with ferric chloride transmission electron microscopy energy dispersed x ray spectroscopy tem edxs combined with extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy exafs at the fe k edge are used to provide an insight into the nature of coagulant species whereas jar tests laser diffraction small angle x ray scattering saxs and electrophoretic mobility are used to investigate the aggregation dynamics of silica particles in the presence of phosphate ligand we show that in spite of a slight increase in the consumption of iron coagulant the addition of phosphate significantly improves the formation of silica aggregates provided that the elemental fe p ratio remains above 7 such effects originate from both a large increase in the overall number of coagulant species the binding of a phosphate ligand terminating the growth of polymeric chains of edge sharing fe octahedra and a change in the nature of the coagulant species that evolves with the fe p ratio small polycations built up from fe oligomers linked by phosphate tetrahedra being eventually formed those non equilibrium nanosize fe p coagulant

water and wastewater treatment operations until now the classical destabilization mechanisms reported in the literature i e charge neutralization with iron or aluminum hydrolysis products in the acidic ph range and enmeshment within an abundant mass of amorphous precipitate at basic ph duan and gregory 2003 yu et al 2015 have not been clearly linked to usual aggregation descriptors such as floc size or floc growth rate as a result day to day operations such as readjusting the optimal coagulant concentration following a change in raw water quality remain mainly based on empirical guidelines el samrani et al 2008 the primary reason for such limitations originates from the complex interplay between the various physico chemical parameters that underlie coagulation of raw water when added to water the iron or aluminum salt hydrolyses to yield hydrolysis products this lowers the ph of the treated water which subsequently modifies the charge of the colloidal matter and the organization of the natural organic matter during the course of aggregation sieliechi et al 2008 chen et al 2018 in addition the presence of complexing anions may significantly alter the hydrolytic pathway of the coagulant rose et al 1996 1997 vilgé ritter et al 1999 doelsch et al 2000 2003 and hence the nature of hydrolysis products responsible for aggregation el samrani et al 2004 2006 preformed coagulant species such as al13 polycations have also been shown to depolymerize upon association with colloidal matter present in the raw water lartiges et al 1997 masion et al 2000 this paper attempts to decipher the intricate relationships between simple aggregation descriptors and the nature of coagulant species formed in the particular case of silica nanoparticles aggregated with ferric chloride in the presence of phosphate ligands at ph 7 5 ferric chloride is a hydrolyzing metal salt commonly used in drinking water treatment for turbidity removal and in wastewater treatment for phosphate elimination sieliechi et al 2008 hauduc et al 2015 in view of the selected ph and range of phosphate concentrations the present study is more relevant to wastewater treatment than drinking water treatment el samrani et al 2004 houhou et al 2009 however our investigation may also open new lines of research on the synthesis of innovative inorganic coagulants enhanced aggregation efficiency being observed with iron based coagulants prepolymerized in the presence of po4 3 and sio4 4 ligands wang et al 2000 chen et al 2015 the aggregation of silica nanoparticles was followed by turbidity removal electrophoretic mobility of aggregates kinetics of floc growth and maximum floc size reached during aggregation using laser diffraction and floc structure at the semi local scale using saxs the nature of fe p hydrolysis products was investigated by exafs at the fe k edge combined with tem edxs exafs probes the average local atomic environment around the fe atoms and provides the numbers types and interatomic distances to neighboring atoms whereas tem edxs enables the determination of average fe p elemental ratio of aggregates we show that even though the presence of phosphate complexing ligand involves a slight additional consumption in coagulant floc growth and turbidity removal can be optimized with an appropriate addition of phosphate ligand 2 experimental section 2 1 sample preparation the suspensions of silica nanoparticles were prepared from the dilution of ludox hs40 colloidal silica sigma aldrich to 500 mg l using a 4 10 3 mol l nahco3 solution to provide an ionic strength buffer lartiges et al 1997 ludox hs40 silica nanoparticles are almost spherical in shape with an average diameter of 14 nm axelos et al 1989 an aliquot of phosphate solution taken from a 0 1 mol l na2hpo4 2h2o stock solution was then added to the silica suspension before adjusting the ph of the suspension to 7 5 by dropwise addition of dilute hcl a commercial unhydrolyzed ferric chloride solution arkema 38 wt in fecl3 and 1 4 in density was used as coagulant the aggregation experiments were conducted in a 1l reactor equipped with 4 plexiglas baffles and a rectangular paddle placed at one third of the reactor height from the bottom lartiges et al 1997 the coagulant was added under agitation as a pure solution with a micropipette eppendorf and stirring was maintained at 100 rpm average velocity gradient g of 135 s 1 for 40 min the coagulated suspension was then allowed to settle for 24h in graduated imhoff cones such settling time is unusually long for a jar test but is required to compare for a given amount of added phosphate the settling of aggregates formed in the presence and in the absence of silica nanoparticles it is also worth noting that the drop in ph after ferric chloride addition was less than 1 in the range of coagulant concentrations investigated 2 2 aggregates characterization after 24h of settling 50 ml of supernatant were collected from about 25 mm below the free surface with a syringe the residual turbidity of supernatant was measured with a hach xr ratio turbidimeter and 30 ml of supernatant were filtered on a 0 2 μm pore size cellulose acetate membrane machery nagel for analysis of dissolved fe si and p icp aes jobin yvon 70 type b model the electrophoretic mobility of aggregates was determined using a zetaphoremeter iii sephy cad equipped with a ccd camera to track the trajectories of aggregates under a constant direct current electric field 800 v m 1 ml of settled sediment was re dispersed in the corresponding supernatant before being pumped to the measurement cell about 100 measurements of aggregate mobility were carried out for a given coagulant phosphate concentration the size distribution of aggregates was measured on line using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer in the 1 2 600 μm size range the aggregated suspension was continuously withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor passed through the analyzer beam with a peristaltic pump located downstream the measurement cell flow rate of 55 ml min before being recycled to the reactor previous experiments conducted with shear sensitive aggregates under similar operating conditions showed that the relative variations in aggregate size measured by the laser sizer were closely related to the changes in agitation conditions inside the reactor rather than to shearing in the transport tubing chaignon et al 2002 aggregate size measurements were averaged for 1 s and taken every 3 s to ensure a complete renewal of the measurement cell the volume size distributions thus obtained are monomodal self similar during aggregate growth and hence the aggregation dynamics can be represented by the temporal evolution of mean aggregate diameter d50 as already shown in previous studies chaignon et al 2002 sieliechi et al 2016 d50 grows linearly with time to reach a maximum diameter d50max the slope of the straight portion of the curve defines the aggregation rate 2 3 sediment characterization small angle x ray scattering saxs experiments were performed using freshly settled aggregates on the d22 beamline at lure synchrotron facility orsay france the detector was positioned at 2 52 m from the sample the collected data covered the q range from 2 5 10 3 to 10 1 å 1 with q 4πsin θ λ in which q is the magnitude of the scattering vector 2θ the scattering angle and λ the wavelength of x rays 1 49 å such range of q values does not cover the guinier regime of silica aggregates obtained in this study but allows studying the fractal regime below 1 μm the intensity scattered by the aggregates can be expressed as i q k i0 q g q where k is a constant i0 q the intensity scattered by a single silica particle and g q an interference function related to the particle arrangement within the aggregate when the aggregates are fractal g q can be approximated by g q q df in the 1 l 1 r0 q range where df is the fractal dimension of aggregates l the characteristic length of aggregates and r0 the size of elementary particles ramsay and booth 1983 the sediment was freeze dried before observation with a philips cm20 transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edax the powder was dispersed by sonication in ethanol and a drop of suspension was then evaporated on a carbon coated copper grid after calibration of the energy dispersive x ray spectrometer with a phosphosiderite standard fepo4 h2o the fe p elemental ratio of aggregates was determined from about 50 edx spectra collected at random locations using a 70 nm probe size and a 30 s counting time acquisition exafs experiments were performed on the d42 beamline at lure synchrotron facility the freeze dried sediment was prepared as pellets using microcrystalline cellulose the x ray absorption spectra were recorded in transmission mode at room temperature around the fe k edge from 7000 to 8100ev with 2ev steps and 2 s collecting time exafs data reduction was performed according to a standard procedure previously described manceau and calas 1986 a kaiser window 3 5 14 7 å 1 was used for deriving fourier transforms from exafs spectra bonnin et al 1985 the radial functions rdf thus obtained are not corrected for phase shifts which leads to peaks shifted down by about 0 3 å compared with crystallographic distances fitting was essentially carried out on the second coordination shell on the backfiltered k3khi k curves in the 2 1 3 5 å range theoretical phase and amplitude functions were used to obtain the number of neighbors in the shell around the absorbing fe atom and the radial distances as well as the debye waller factors σ the electron mean free path g k λ and the energy shift δe were respectively fixed at 0 82 å 1 and 5 ev 3 results 3 1 destabilization of silica nanoparticles with ferric chloride in the presence of phosphate ligand typical curves of residual turbidity as a function of ferric chloride concentration in the presence of various amounts of phosphate are shown in fig 1 a the curves exhibit similar profiles characteristic of a nanoparticle suspension increasingly aggregated by the addition of coagulant sieliechi et al 2008 at low ferric chloride concentration the turbidity of the supernatant steadily increases as small non settleable aggregates of increasing size are formed after reaching a maximum the residual turbidity steeply decreases with further coagulant addition when settling aggregates are obtained a rapid build up in sediment volume is then observed in that concentration range fig 1b the minimum ferric chloride concentration that determines the highest level of turbidity reduction defines the optimal coagulant dose fe opt the presence of phosphate ligand has two main effects i the maximal residual turbidity is lowered upon addition of low p levels and then increases with further addition of p ii the residual turbidity curve is stretched towards higher coagulant concentrations or in other terms the addition of p to the silica suspension increases fe opt actually as illustrated in fig 2 a fe opt becomes proportional to the phosphate content of the suspension above a p concentration of 0 5 mmol l i e a fe p molar ratio less than 2 regardless of silica concentration as the removal of p and silica nanoparticles occurs simultaneously when settleable aggregates are formed fig 2b it is clear that all the components silica nanoparticles phosphate and iron coagulant participate together in the aggregation process to further investigate the aggregation behavior of silica nanoparticles at low phosphate concentrations a series of experiments were conducted with increasing phosphate concentrations and a fixed amount of ferric chloride fig 3 the coagulant concentration selected 0 36 mmol l i e close to the maximum of residual turbidity in the absence of phosphate ligand see fig 1a helps exacerbating the sensitivity to phosphate additions further underdosing or on the contrary iron concentrations in the optimal dosing range would reduce the range of turbidity variation for an iron concentration equal to 0 36 mmol l the addition of small amounts of phosphate ligand linearly decreases the level of residual turbidity from an initial high level of about 27 ntu to reach a minimum of 12 ntu for a fe p molar ratio of about 7 before slightly re increasing on the other hand the sediment volume increases and reaches a maximum that is slightly shifted to higher fe p ratios i e lower phosphate concentrations before returning to zero fig 3 according to fig 1a it can be expected that the residual turbidity will decrease again at higher phosphate concentration 3 2 characterization of aggregates that a small addition of phosphate ligand improves the removal of silica nanoparticles with ferric chloride implies a significant change of aggregate properties fig 4 a shows typical temporal evolutions of the mean aggregate diameter d50 for various added p concentrations and an iron coagulant concentration of 0 36 mmol l both the aggregation rate and the maximum mean aggregate diameter are inferred from these curves fig 4b presents the corresponding evolution of aggregation rate and maximum mean aggregate diameter d50max with phosphate concentration like residual turbidity and sediment volume both the aggregation rate and the d50max drastically vary with small phosphate additions the aggregation rate steeply increases from initially non measurable values to reach a 50 μm min growth at a fe p molar ratio of about 14 and then gradually returns to zero d50max also increases from an initial value lower than the measuring range of the particle sizer to reach a maximum mean aggregate diameter of about 110 μm at a fe p ratio of 7 and then drops to submicron sizes at higher phosphate concentrations an elemental ratio fe p in the 7 8 range is also a threshold value for the structure of aggregates the saxs curves shown in fig 5 a as a log log plot of the scattering intensity versus the scattering vector are characterized by a linear portion that identifies the fractal region in the 6 10 3 4 10 2 å 1 q range followed by a cross over at higher q that corresponds to the scattering of silica nanoparticles of radius 7 nm the fractal dimension df obtained from the slope of the scattering factor remains close to 1 72 for small additions of phosphate ligand fig 5b however above a fe p of 7 df exhibits a step increase to an average value of 1 83 on the other hand the electrophoretic mobility of aggregates varying between 2 95 and 3 05 μm s 1 v cm 1 remains almost constant in the range of p concentration investigated fig 6 the diameter of ludox silica nanoparticles 14 nm is well below the lower size limit of particles about 0 2 μm that can be followed from the image analysis system of a zetaphoremeter iii however it is expected that the electrophoretic mobility of pristine silica particles is lower than 3 μm s 1 v cm 1 since such value was reported for ludox hs particles in a suspension of same ionic strength as ours but at ph 6 fatombi et al 2013 3 3 nature of coagulant species edx microanalysis provides a first approach to the nature of hydrolysis products that trigger the aggregation of silica nanoparticles fig 7 the histograms of fe p atomic ratios measured on the freeze dried sediments obtained for a given ferric chloride concentration and increasing phosphate concentrations reveal that at low phosphate concentration i e fe p 10 the fe p atomic ratios are rather uniformly distributed across the 2 10 range at higher phosphate concentrations i e fe p 8 the width of fe p distributions becomes narrower and a maximum around 4 5 clearly emerges this suggests that well defined coagulant species formed from the complexation of hydrolyzed fe and phosphate ligands are developing with increasing phosphate concentration exafs curves and k3 weighted fourier transforms of exafs oscillations into r space are reported in fig 8 the first peak of the fourier transform or radial distribution function rdf is centered at 1 5 å and represents the first coordination shell around iron atoms this first shell is composed of 6 oxygen atoms with a fe o bond length close to 2 å which is consistent with previous x ray absorption studies bottero et al 1994 zhu et al 2013 collins et al 2016 the second peak centered at 2 7 2 8 å is of greater interest since it reflects the average degree of iron polymerization in our case three kinds of atoms fe p and si can be expected in the second coordination shell of iron atom k3χ k curves reveal a small oscillation centered at 7 5 å 1 typical of heavy atoms and hence a fe contribution in the second shell that sharply decreases with increasing phosphate concentration in parallel the intensity of the second peak of the fourier transform gradually decreases the fitting results are reported in table 1 and fig 9 in the absence of phosphate addition i e p fe 0 two iron neighbors sub shells are necessary for fitting the distances thus obtained 3 04 and 3 14 å identify edge sharing fe o octahedra bottero et al 1994 doelsch et al 2000 collins et al 2016 the fitting can be slightly improved by the addition of a third shell assigned to a fe si contribution si being a lighter atom in comparison with fe its contribution as a backscatterer in the exafs oscillations can be argued in particular the number of si neighbors is rather inaccurate upon the addition of p 0 008 mmol l to the silica suspension i e fe p 45 the exafs curve is fitted with two sub shells of fe fe edge sharing bonding and a supplementary shell of iron atoms linked by double corner sharing fig 10 b further increase in phosphate significantly decreases the number of iron neighbors sharing edges from 2 5 0 5 to 1 5 0 5 n1 n2 in table 1 the fe fe distance varying from 2 98 to 3 04 å 0 1 å for the first sub shell and from 3 13 to 3 15 å 0 1 å for the second sub shell the contribution of double corner sharing fe fe bonding could not be evidenced which implies a limited hydrolysis of iron species above a p addition of 0 008 mmol l the curve fitting is mainly performed using edge sharing fe fe bonding corner sharing fe p bonding and in the case of fe p 6 4 and fe p 5 8 with corner sharing fe fe bonding the values of fe fe bond length 3 56 and 3 58 å respectively for fe p 6 4 and fe p 5 8 may identify the presence of double corner sharing trimers fig 10b or fe2p complexes fig 10e actually the latter geometry should be favored as phosphate neighbors are needed for an appropriate fitting the structural parameters inferred from curve fitting analysis reveal that the presence of phosphate ligand decreases the number of iron neighbors i e a decrease of fe fe bonds and leads to a contribution of phosphorus atoms in the second coordination shell of fe the number of phosphate neighbors is highly variable from one sample to another but it should be noted that those numbers are rather inaccurate and are only given to evidence the presence of fe p bonds in contrast the values of fe p bond length between 3 26 and 3 34 å are unambiguously assigned to the formation of single corner sharing complexes see fig 10d e and f for fe p ratios lower than 18 the phosphate ligand substitution for fe does not prevent the formation of fe dimers and fe trimers the number of neighbors subshells 1 and 2 remaining above 1 nevertheless the presence of phosphate certainly changes the size of iron polymer chains but as the curve fitting was performed in the 2 5 3 8 å distance range no information can be inferred about the chain size and the semi local structure of iron octahedra aggregates 4 discussion 4 1 nature of coagulant species in the system ferric chloride phosphate silica nanoparticles most of the information available in the literature on iron iii hydrolysis has been acquired in the context of solutions of high fe concentration decimolar to molar slowly hydrolyzed from acidic conditions tchoubar et al 1991 bottero et al 1994 rose et al 1996 1997 doelsch et al 2000 2003 collins et al 2016 thus depending on the hydrolysis ratio oh fe dilution and ageing the hydrolysis of ferric chloride solutions typically yields monomers corner sharing dimers edge sharing dimers double corner trimers polycations and aggregates of those polycations that eventually form akaganeite β feooh upon ageing murphy et al 1976 tchoubar et al 1991 manceau and drits 1993 bottero et al 1994 in the presence of organic or inorganic complexing ligands the speciation diagrams of iron base solutions are drastically modified most often when a sufficient amount of complexing ligands has been added e g phosphate anions small organic acids dissolved organic matter the hydrolysis of ferric chloride is hindered to the dimer stage rose et al 1996 1997 vilgé ritter et al 1999 doelsch et al 2000 in the case of silicate and sulfate ligands exafs at the fe k edge and saxs experiments revealed the presence of edge and corner sharing fe shells that led to the formation of three dimensional molecular clusters doelsch et al 2000 2003 zhu et al 2012 collins et al 2016 in contrast natural raw waters and wastewaters relevant to this study generally show neutral or slightly alkaline ph conditions before being treated with ferric chloride concentrations in the millimolar range or less el samrani et al 2004 caravelli et al 2010 the rapid hydrolysis of ferric chloride that results from such conditions pham et al 2006 modifies the classical polymerization pathway in particular the formation of the double corner sharing fe trimer fig 10b can only be evidenced for a fe p ratio of 45 instead polymeric chains of edge sharing fe octaedra equivalent to those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations zhang et al 2015 occur in solution in the presence of increasing phosphate concentration the complexation dynamics becomes gradually dominant over the kinetics of iron iii hydrolysis the number of iron neighbors sharing edges decreases which can be interpreted as the termination of the active chains growth whenever a phosphate ligand binds on the end of a fe polymer chain an increased number of oligomeric structures and hence an increased number of coagulant species is then formed from edge sharing fe dimers trimers oligomers linked by a phosphate tetrahedra fig 10 single corner sharing fe octahedra identified at fe p ratios of 6 4 and 5 8 may also participate in the bridging of oligomeric fe p chains rose et al 1996 below a fe p molar ratio of 7 the excess phosphate binding on iron dimers trimers should decrease the charge of coagulant species and or promote the growth of oligomeric structures through phosphate bridging fig 10 therefore both the number and efficiency of coagulant species decrease for a fe p less than 7 in summary if the strong affinity of iron iii for phosphate lowers the degree of polymerization of iron coagulant rose et al 1996 1997 el samrani et al 2004 it also increases at first the number of coagulant species and improves the aggregation of silica nanoparticles further addition of phosphate ligand fe p 7 becomes detrimental for aggregation to evidence a possible effect of silica nanoparticles on the nature of coagulant species is not straightforward the detection of si neighbors using exafs at the fe k edge is rather difficult because of the large difference in atomic number between si and fe including a si shell improves the spectral fitting only in the absence of phosphate it has been shown that the polymerization of iron iii is inhibited for fe si molar ratios in the 1 to 4 range doelsch et al 2000 in our case the number of silanol groups per unit surface area of silica that may interact with the fe hydrolyzed products is about 4 6 nm 2 zhuravlev 2000 using a specific surface area of 220 m2 g for the ludox hs nanoparticles we calculate a fe si molar ratio of 0 42 actually both steric hindrance and charge repulsion between the positive coagulant species attached on the surface of silica nanoparticles should further decrease this ratio therefore the effect of the silica surface on iron hydrolysis is expected to be considerably less than that of phosphate ligand even though the association of polymeric chains of edge sharing fe octahedra with the silica nanoparticles may also inhibit the chain growth 4 2 aggregation mechanism of silica nanoparticles in the system fecl3 po4 it is especially interesting that the nature of hydrolysis products and hence the type of coagulant species that bind the silica nanoparticles significantly changes with the relative concentrations of iron coagulant and phosphate ligand such feature has not been addressed in previous physicochemical models for phosphorus removal in which only equilibrium species such as fehpo4 feh2po4 2 or fe oh 3 have been considered smith et al 2008 caravelli et al 2010 hauduc et al 2015 our study reveals that fe dimers through the formation of complexes such as fe2 hpo4 oh h2o 8 3 and fe4 po4 oh 2 h2o 16 7 play a significant role during phosphate removal those transient species nevertheless leading to the thermodynamically favored fe po4 h2o 5 complex at longer times lente et al 2000 lente and fabian 2002 that the ionic background of the raw water may interfere with the hydrolytic pathway of aluminum or iron coagulants is also overlooked in traditional destabilization mechanisms duan and gregory 2003 yet in continental surface waters the average contents in silica sulfate phosphate and chloride anions meybeck and helmer 1989 are in sufficient amounts to modify the polymerization of hydrolyzing metal salts el samrani et al 2006 it is nevertheless rather difficult to precisely elucidate for a given fe p ratio both the number and various types of coagulant species exafs and even more tem edxs only provide an average description of the hydrolysis products present in the bulk solution if iron oligomers linked by a phosphate tetrahedron may lead to polycations such as fe4 po4 oh 2 h2o 16 7 those highly charged species do not account by themselves for the destabilization of silica nanoparticles under the conditions of ph and ionic strength used in this study the surface charge density of ludox nanoparticles is about 1 6 μc cm 2 bolt 1957 allison 2009 this corresponds to 61 negatively charged sio groups per silica particle in that case the number of polycations of charge 7 necessary to neutralize the silica surface would be less than 10 as a 500 mg l ludox hs suspension corresponds to a 1 58 1017 particles per liter a fe concentration of 9 4 μmol l should then be theoretically sufficient to achieve the neutralization of silica nanoparticles the latter concentration is two orders of magnitude less than the actual coagulant concentration used therefore the coagulant species present in suspension are certainly a mix of weakly positive hydrolyzed products comprising on the average about 4 5 fe atoms for one p atom as the saxs curves do not reveal any increase in the radius of elementary particles with p addition the size of coagulant species is expected to remain in the lower nanometer range in that context a sweep flocculation mechanism characterized by the formation of an abundant precipitate enmeshing the silica nanoparticles seems rather unlikely especially in the underdosing range moreover the examination of tem micrographs does not reveal the presence of an abundant hydroxide precipitate see fig s2 in supporting information a simple charge neutralization mechanism can also be argued since the electrophoretic mobility of silica aggregates is negative however a hetero aggregation process involving negative silica particles attached by positive nanosize coagulant species may reconcile all the observations in that framework a local charge neutralization within the aggregate is sufficient to ensure the build up of aggregates the negative electrophoretic mobility being explained by the terminal attachment of partially neutralized and still negative silica particles in excess at the outer part of aggregates the linear decrease in residual turbidity and the concomitant increase in aggregate size observed with increasing phosphate concentration when using an underdose of iron coagulant figs 3 and 4b are also consistent with a hetero aggregation framework indeed when mixing large and small oppositely charged particles previous research has shown that below the destabilization threshold the number of hetero aggregates obtained decreases linearly with the relative number of large and small particles dumont et al 1990 in our case a small addition of phosphate ligand determines an increase in the overall number of nanosize coagulant species and hence promotes the growth of larger aggregates thus improving their settleability although limited to less than a decade in q an estimate of about 1 7 for the fractal exponent of silica aggregates is consistent with a diffusion limited cluster aggregation dlca meakin 1987 such dlca regime can be argued because the aggregates are formed in a stirred vessel the relative importance of shear aggregation to brownian diffusion can assessed using the péclet number pe 6πηgd0 3 kt in which η is the dynamic viscosity of the suspension η 1 07 10 6 m2s 1 g the average velocity gradient g 135 s 1 d0 the radius of silica particles d0 7 nm k the boltzmann constant and t the absolute temperature frappier et al 2010 in the early stage of aggregation pe is about 2 10 7 which suggests that brownian aggregation is largely predominant over shear aggregation and governs the aggregate structure investigated by saxs for micron size aggregates the two aggregation modes become equivalent the slightly higher df value of 1 83 obtained below a fe p ratio of 7 can also be explained by the same dlca aggregation regime provided that some reorganization of aggregates is allowed meakin and julien 1988 wu et al 2013 have recently shown that thermal restructuring may drive an increase in the fractal dimension of dlca aggregates that is more pronounced with a decrease in the radius of primary particles for silica nanoparticles having a radius of 7 nm a df value of about 1 9 can be expected if the bonds between primary particles are weak wu et al 2013 accordingly this suggests that the bonds formed from the coagulant species between the silica particles are strong and even rigid above a fe p of 7 and that some restructuring of aggregates occurs below a fe p of 7 because of the slightly different nature of coagulant species that leads to a lower binding energy between the particles 5 conclusions the aggregation of silica nanoparticles with ferric chloride was studied in the presence of small amounts of phosphate ligand the characteristics of aggregates formed were described using a combination of techniques i e laser granulometry turbidity measurements saxs tem edxs microanalysis and exafs at the fe k edge we found that the addition of phosphate dramatically modifies the nature of hydrolysis products without changing the aggregation mechanism the phosphate ligands terminate the polymerization of fe octahedra chains to lead to an increasing number of fe oligomers bridged by phosphate tetrahedra an elemental ratio fe p of about 7 appears optimal for the production of efficient positively charged coagulant species the saxs results indicate that the size of those coagulant species remains in the nanoscale range and reveal that a diffusion limited cluster aggregation governs the structure of aggregates in the early stage of aggregation the prevalence of non equilibrium fe p species formed in the course of chemical coagulation of silica particles suggests that thermodynamic approaches of phosphorus removal with iron or aluminum coagulants are not of much use instead the relative contents in hydrolyzing metal coagulant and in complexing anions in the raw water to be treated coupled with a partial charge model jolivet 2019 might be better suited for describing the coagulant species likely to be formed our results demonstrate the usefulness of coupling microscopic and spectroscopic approaches to clear

acidic ph range and enmeshment within an abundant mass of amorphous precipitate at basic ph duan and gregory 2003 yu et al 2015 have not been clearly linked to usual aggregation descriptors such as floc size or floc growth rate as a result day to day operations such as readjusting the optimal coagulant concentration following a change in raw water quality remain mainly based on empirical guidelines el samrani et al 2008 the primary reason for such limitations originates from the complex interplay between the various physico chemical parameters that underlie coagulation of raw water when added to water the iron or aluminum salt hydrolyses to yield hydrolysis products this lowers the ph of the treated water which subsequently modifies the charge of the colloidal matter and the organization of the natural organic matter during the course of aggregation sieliechi et al 2008 chen et al 2018 in addition the presence of complexing anions may significantly alter the hydrolytic

preformed coagulant species such as al13 polycations have also been shown to depolymerize upon association with colloidal matter present in the raw water lartiges et al 1997 masion et al 2000 this paper attempts to decipher the intricate relationships between simple aggregation descriptors and the nature of coagulant species formed in the particular case of silica nanoparticles aggregated with ferric chloride in the presence of phosphate ligands at ph 7 5 ferric chloride is a hydrolyzing metal salt commonly used in drinking water treatment for turbidity removal and in wastewater treatment for phosphate elimination sieliechi et al 2008 hauduc et al 2015 in view of the selected ph and range of phosphate concentrations the present study is more relevant to wastewater treatment than drinking water treatment el samrani et al 2004 houhou et al 2009 however our investigation may also open new lines of research on the synthesis of innovative inorganic coagulants enhanced aggregation efficiency being observed with iron based coagulants prepolymerized in the presence of po4 3 and sio4 4 ligands wang et al 2000 chen et al 2015 the aggregation of silica nanoparticles was followed by turbidity removal electrophoretic mobility of aggregates kinetics of floc growth and maximum floc size reached during aggregation using laser diffraction and floc structure at the semi local scale using saxs the nature of fe p hydrolysis products was investigated by exafs at the fe k edge combined with tem edxs exafs probes the average local atomic environment around the fe atoms and provides the numbers types and interatomic distances to neighboring atoms whereas tem edxs enables the determination of average fe p elemental ratio of aggregates we show that even though the presence of phosphate complexing ligand involves a slight additional consumption in coagulant floc growth and turbidity removal can be optimized with an appropriate addition of phosphate ligand 2 experimental section 2 1 sample preparation the suspensions of silica nanoparticles were prepared from the dilution of ludox hs40 colloidal silica sigma aldrich to 500 mg l using a 4 10 3 mol l nahco3 solution to provide an ionic strength buffer lartiges et al 1997 ludox hs40 silica nanoparticles are almost spherical in shape with an average diameter of 14 nm axelos et al 1989 an aliquot of phosphate solution taken from a 0 1 mol l na2hpo4 2h2o stock solution was then added to the silica suspension before adjusting the ph of the suspension to 7 5 by dropwise addition of dilute hcl a commercial unhydrolyzed ferric chloride solution arkema 38 wt in fecl3 and 1 4 in density was used as coagulant the aggregation experiments were conducted in a 1l reactor equipped with 4 plexiglas baffles and a rectangular paddle placed at one third of the reactor height from the bottom lartiges et al 1997 the coagulant was added under agitation as a pure solution with a micropipette eppendorf and stirring was maintained at 100 rpm average velocity gradient g of 135 s 1 for 40 min the coagulated suspension was then allowed to settle for 24h in graduated imhoff cones such settling time is unusually long for a jar test but is required to compare for a given amount of added phosphate the settling of aggregates formed in the presence and in the absence of silica nanoparticles it is also worth noting that the drop in ph after ferric chloride addition was less than 1 in the range of coagulant concentrations investigated 2 2 aggregates characterization after 24h of settling 50 ml of supernatant were collected from about 25 mm below the free surface with a syringe the residual turbidity of supernatant was measured with a hach xr ratio turbidimeter and 30 ml of supernatant were filtered on a 0 2 μm pore size cellulose acetate membrane machery nagel for analysis of dissolved fe si and p icp aes jobin yvon 70 type b model the electrophoretic mobility of aggregates was determined using a zetaphoremeter iii sephy cad equipped with a ccd camera to track the trajectories of aggregates under a constant direct current electric field 800 v m 1 ml of settled sediment was re dispersed in the corresponding supernatant before being pumped to the measurement cell about 100 measurements of aggregate mobility were carried out for a given coagulant phosphate concentration the size distribution of aggregates was measured on line using a laser diffraction particle size analyzer malvern mastersizer in the 1 2 600 μm size range the aggregated suspension was continuously withdrawn from the bottom of the reactor passed through the analyzer beam with a peristaltic pump located downstream the measurement cell flow rate of 55 ml min before being recycled to the reactor previous experiments conducted with shear sensitive aggregates under similar operating conditions showed that the relative variations in aggregate size measured by the laser sizer were closely related to the changes in agitation conditions inside the reactor rather than to shearing in the transport tubing chaignon et al 2002 aggregate size measurements were averaged for 1 s and taken every 3 s to ensure a complete renewal of the measurement cell the volume size distributions thus obtained are monomodal self similar during aggregate growth and hence the aggregation dynamics can be represented by the temporal evolution of mean aggregate diameter d50 as already shown in previous studies chaignon et al 2002 sieliechi et al 2016 d50 grows linearly with time to reach a maximum diameter d50max the slope of the straight portion of the curve defines the aggregation rate 2 3 sediment characterization small angle x ray scattering saxs experiments were performed using freshly settled aggregates on the d22 beamline at lure synchrotron facility orsay france the detector was positioned at 2 52 m from the sample the collected data covered the q range from 2 5 10 3 to 10 1 å 1 with q 4πsin θ λ in which q is the magnitude of the scattering vector 2θ the scattering angle and λ the wavelength of x rays 1 49 å such range of q values does not cover the guinier regime of silica aggregates obtained in this study but allows studying the fractal regime below 1 μm the intensity scattered by the aggregates can be expressed as i q k i0 q g q where k is a constant i0 q the intensity scattered by a single silica particle and g q an interference function related to the particle arrangement within the aggregate when the aggregates are fractal g q can be approximated by g q q df in the 1 l 1 r0 q range where df is the fractal dimension of aggregates l the characteristic length of aggregates and r0 the size of elementary particles ramsay and booth 1983 the sediment was freeze dried before observation with a philips cm20 transmission electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive x ray spectrometer edax the powder was dispersed by sonication in ethanol and a drop of suspension was then evaporated on a carbon coated copper grid after calibration of the energy dispersive x ray spectrometer with a phosphosiderite standard fepo4 h2o the fe p elemental ratio of aggregates was determined from about 50 edx spectra collected at random locations using a 70 nm probe size and a 30 s counting time acquisition exafs experiments were performed on the d42 beamline at lure synchrotron facility the freeze dried sediment was prepared as pellets using microcrystalline cellulose the x ray absorption spectra were recorded in transmission mode at room temperature around the fe k edge from 7000 to 8100ev with 2ev steps and 2 s collecting time exafs data reduction was performed according to a standard procedure previously described manceau and calas 1986 a kaiser window 3 5 14 7 å 1 was used for deriving fourier transforms from exafs spectra bonnin et al 1985 the radial functions rdf thus obtained are not corrected for phase shifts which leads to peaks shifted down by about 0 3 å compared with crystallographic distances fitting was essentially carried out on the second coordination shell on the backfiltered k3khi k curves in the 2 1 3 5 å range theoretical phase and amplitude functions were used to obtain the number of neighbors in the shell around the absorbing fe atom and the radial distances as well as the debye waller factors σ the electron mean free path g k λ and the energy shift δe were respectively fixed at 0 82 å 1 and 5 ev 3 results 3 1 destabilization of silica nanoparticles with ferric chloride in the presence of phosphate ligand typical curves of residual turbidity as a function of ferric chloride concentration in the presence of various amounts of phosphate are shown in fig 1 a the curves exhibit similar profiles characteristic of a nanoparticle suspension increasingly aggregated by the addition of coagulant sieliechi et al 2008 at low ferric chloride concentration the turbidity of the supernatant steadily increases as small non settleable aggregates of increasing size are formed after reaching a maximum the residual turbidity steeply decreases with further coagulant addition when settling aggregates are obtained a rapid build up in sediment volume is then observed in that concentration range fig 1b the minimum ferric chloride concentration that determines the highest level of turbidity reduction defines the optimal coagulant dose fe opt the presence of phosphate ligand has two main effects i the maximal residual turbidity is lowered upon addition of low p levels and then increases with further addition of p ii the residual turbidity curve is stretched towards higher coagulant concentrations or in other terms the addition of p to the silica suspension increases fe opt actually as illustrated in fig 2 a fe opt becomes proportional to the phosphate content of the suspension above a p concentration of 0 5 mmol l i e a fe p molar ratio less than 2 regardless of silica concentration as the removal of p and silica nanoparticles occurs simultaneously when settleable aggregates are formed fig 2b it is clear that all the components silica nanoparticles phosphate and iron coagulant participate together in the aggregation process to further investigate the aggregation behavior of silica nanoparticles at low phosphate concentrations a series of experiments were conducted with increasing phosphate concentrations and a fixed amount of ferric chloride fig 3 the coagulant concentration selected 0 36 mmol l i e close to the maximum of residual turbidity in the absence of phosphate ligand see fig 1a helps exacerbating the sensitivity to phosphate additions further underdosing or on the contrary iron concentrations in the optimal dosing range would reduce the range of turbidity variation for an iron concentration equal to 0 36 mmol l the addition of small amounts of phosphate ligand linearly decreases the level of residual turbidity from an initial high level of about 27 ntu to reach a minimum of 12 ntu for a fe p molar ratio of about 7 before slightly re increasing on the other hand the sediment volume increases and reaches a maximum that is slightly shifted to higher fe p ratios i e lower phosphate concentrations before returning to zero fig 3 according to fig 1a it can be expected that the residual turbidity will decrease again at higher phosphate concentration 3 2 characterization of aggregates that a small addition of phosphate ligand improves the removal of silica nanoparticles with ferric chloride implies a significant change of aggregate properties fig 4 a shows typical temporal evolutions of the mean aggregate diameter d50 for various added p concentrations and an iron coagulant concentration of 0 36 mmol l both the aggregation rate and the maximum mean aggregate diameter are inferred from these curves fig 4b presents the corresponding evolution of aggregation rate and maximum mean aggregate diameter d50max with phosphate concentration like residual turbidity and sediment volume both the aggregation rate and the d50max drastically vary with small phosphate additions the aggregation rate steeply increases from initially non measurable values to reach a 50 μm min growth at a fe p molar ratio of about 14 and then gradually returns to zero d50max also increases from an initial value lower than the measuring range of the particle sizer to reach a maximum mean aggregate diameter of about 110 μm at a fe p ratio of 7 and then drops to submicron sizes at higher phosphate concentrations an elemental ratio fe p in the 7 8 range is also a threshold value for the structure of aggregates the saxs curves shown in fig 5 a as a log log plot of the scattering intensity versus the scattering vector are characterized by a linear portion that identifies the fractal region in the 6 10 3 4 10 2 å 1 q range followed by a cross over at higher q that corresponds to the scattering of silica nanoparticles of radius 7 nm the fractal dimension df obtained from the slope of the scattering factor remains close to 1 72 for small additions of phosphate ligand fig 5b however above a fe p of 7 df exhibits a step increase to an average value of 1 83 on the other hand the electrophoretic mobility of aggregates varying between 2 95 and 3 05 μm s 1 v cm 1 remains almost constant in the range of p concentration investigated fig 6 the diameter of ludox silica nanoparticles 14 nm is well below the lower size limit of particles about 0 2 μm that can be followed from the image analysis system of a zetaphoremeter iii however it is expected that the electrophoretic mobility of pristine silica particles is lower than 3 μm s 1 v cm 1 since such value was reported for ludox hs particles in a suspension of same ionic strength as ours but at ph 6 fatombi et al 2013 3 3 nature of coagulant species edx microanalysis provides a first approach to the nature of hydrolysis products that trigger the aggregation of silica nanoparticles fig 7 the histograms of fe p atomic ratios measured on the freeze dried sediments obtained for a given ferric chloride concentration and increasing phosphate concentrations reveal that at low phosphate concentration i e fe p 10 the fe p atomic ratios are rather uniformly distributed across the 2 10 range at higher phosphate concentrations i e fe p 8 the width of fe p distributions becomes narrower and a maximum around 4 5 clearly emerges this suggests that well defined coagulant species formed from the complexation of hydrolyzed fe and phosphate ligands are developing with increasing phosphate concentration exafs curves and k3 weighted fourier transforms of exafs oscillations into r space are reported in fig 8 the first peak of the fourier transform or radial distribution function rdf is centered at 1 5 å and represents the first coordination shell around iron atoms this first shell is composed of 6 oxygen atoms with a fe o bond length close to 2 å which is consistent with previous x ray absorption studies bottero et al 1994 zhu et al 2013 collins et al 2016 the second peak centered at 2 7 2 8 å is of greater interest since it reflects the average degree of iron polymerization in our case three kinds of atoms fe p and si can be expected in the second coordination shell of iron atom k3χ k curves reveal a small oscillation centered at 7 5 å 1 typical of heavy atoms and hence a fe contribution in the second shell that sharply decreases with increasing phosphate concentration in parallel the intensity of the second peak of the fourier transform gradually decreases the fitting results are reported in table 1 and fig 9 in the absence of phosphate addition i e p fe 0 two iron neighbors sub shells are necessary for fitting the distances thus obtained 3 04 and 3 14 å identify edge sharing fe o octahedra bottero et al 1994 doelsch et al 2000 collins et al 2016 the fitting can be slightly improved by the addition of a third shell assigned to a fe si contribution si being a lighter atom in comparison with fe its contribution as a backscatterer in the exafs oscillations can be argued in particular the number of si neighbors is rather inaccurate upon the addition of p 0 008 mmol l to the silica suspension i e fe p 45 the exafs curve is fitted with two sub shells of fe fe edge sharing bonding and a supplementary shell of iron atoms linked by double corner sharing fig 10 b further increase in phosphate significantly decreases the number of iron neighbors sharing edges from 2 5 0 5 to 1 5 0 5 n1 n2 in table 1 the fe fe distance varying from 2 98 to 3 04 å 0 1 å for the first sub shell and from 3 13 to 3 15 å 0 1 å for the second sub shell the contribution of double corner sharing fe fe bonding could not be evidenced which implies a limited hydrolysis of iron species above a p addition of 0 008 mmol l the curve fitting is mainly performed using edge sharing fe fe bonding corner sharing fe p bonding and in the case of fe p 6 4 and fe p 5 8 with corner sharing fe fe bonding the values of fe fe bond length 3 56 and 3 58 å respectively for fe p 6 4 and fe p 5 8 may identify the presence of double corner sharing trimers fig 10b or fe2p complexes fig 10e actually the latter geometry should be favored as phosphate neighbors are needed for an appropriate fitting the structural parameters inferred from curve fitting analysis reveal that the presence of phosphate ligand decreases the number of iron neighbors i e a decrease of fe fe bonds and leads to a contribution of phosphorus atoms in the second coordination shell of fe the number of phosphate neighbors is highly variable from one sample to another but it should be noted that those numbers are rather inaccurate and are only given to evidence the presence of fe p bonds in contrast the values of fe p bond length between 3 26 and 3 34 å are unambiguously assigned to the formation of single corner sharing complexes see fig 10d e and f for fe p ratios lower than 18 the phosphate ligand substitution for fe does not prevent the formation of fe dimers and fe trimers the number of neighbors subshells 1 and 2 remaining above 1 nevertheless the presence of phosphate certainly changes the size of iron polymer chains but as the curve fitting was performed in the 2 5 3 8 å distance range no information can be inferred about the chain size and the semi local structure of iron octahedra aggregates 4 discussion 4 1 nature of coagulant species in the system ferric chloride phosphate silica nanoparticles most of the information available in the literature on iron iii hydrolysis has been acquired in the context of solutions of high fe concentration decimolar to molar slowly hydrolyzed from acidic conditions tchoubar et al 1991 bottero et al 1994 rose et al 1996 1997 doelsch et al 2000 2003 collins et al 2016 thus depending on the hydrolysis ratio oh fe dilution and ageing the hydrolysis of ferric chloride solutions typically yields monomers corner sharing dimers edge sharing dimers double corner trimers polycations and aggregates of those polycations that eventually form akaganeite β feooh upon ageing murphy et al 1976 tchoubar et al 1991 manceau and drits 1993 bottero et al 1994 in the presence of organic or inorganic complexing ligands the speciation diagrams of iron base solutions are drastically modified most often when a sufficient amount of complexing ligands has been added e g phosphate anions small organic acids dissolved organic matter the hydrolysis of ferric chloride is hindered to the dimer stage rose et al 1996 1997 vilgé ritter et al 1999 doelsch et al 2000 in the case of silicate and sulfate ligands exafs at the fe k edge and saxs experiments revealed the presence of edge and corner sharing fe shells that led to the formation of three dimensional molecular clusters doelsch et al 2000 2003 zhu et al 2012 collins et al 2016 in contrast natural raw waters and wastewaters relevant to this study generally show neutral or slightly alkaline ph conditions before being treated with ferric chloride concentrations in the millimolar range or less el samrani et al 2004 caravelli et al 2010 the rapid hydrolysis of ferric chloride that results from such conditions pham et al 2006 modifies the classical polymerization pathway in particular the formation of the double corner sharing fe trimer fig 10b can only be evidenced for a fe p ratio of 45 instead polymeric chains of edge sharing fe octaedra equivalent to those obtained from molecular dynamics simulations zhang et al 2015 occur in solution in the presence of increasing phosphate concentration the complexation dynamics becomes gradually dominant over the kinetics of iron iii hydrolysis the number of iron neighbors sharing edges decreases which can be interpreted as the termination of the active chains growth whenever a phosphate ligand binds on the end of a fe polymer chain an increased number of oligomeric structures and hence an increased number of coagulant species is then formed from edge sharing fe dimers trimers oligomers linked by a phosphate tetrahedra fig 10 single corner sharing fe octahedra identified at fe p ratios of 6 4 and 5 8 may also participate in the bridging of oligomeric fe p chains rose et al 1996 below a fe p molar ratio of 7 the excess phosphate binding on iron dimers trimers should decrease the charge of coagulant species and or promote the growth of oligomeric structures through phosphate bridging fig 10 therefore both the number and efficiency of coagulant species decrease for a fe p less than 7 in summary if the strong affinity of iron iii for phosphate lowers the degree of polymerization of iron coagulant rose et al 1996 1997 el samrani et al 2004 it also increases at first the number of coagulant species and improves the aggregation of silica nanoparticles further addition of phosphate ligand fe p 7 becomes detrimental for aggregation to evidence a possible effect of silica nanoparticles on the nature of coagulant species is not straightforward the detection of si neighbors using exafs at the fe k edge is rather difficult because of the large difference in atomic number between si and fe including a si shell improves the spectral fitting only in the absence of phosphate it has been shown that the polymerization of iron iii is inhibited for fe si molar ratios in the 1 to 4 range doelsch et al 2000 in our case the number of silanol groups per unit surface area of silica that may interact with the fe hydrolyzed products is about 4 6 nm 2 zhuravlev 2000 using a specific surface area of 220 m2 g for the ludox hs nanoparticles we calculate a fe si molar ratio of 0 42 actually both steric hindrance and charge repulsion between the positive coagulant species attached on the surface of silica nanoparticles should further decrease this ratio therefore the effect of the silica surface on iron hydrolysis is expected to be considerably less than that of phosphate ligand even though the association of polymeric chains of edge sharing fe octahedra with the silica nanoparticles may also inhibit the chain growth 4 2 aggregation mechanism of silica nanoparticles in the system fecl3 po4 it is especially interesting that the nature of hydrolysis products and hence the type of coagulant species that bind the silica nanoparticles significantly changes with the relative concentrations of iron coagulant and phosphate ligand such feature has not been addressed in previous physicochemical models for phosphorus removal in which only equilibrium species such as fehpo4 feh2po4 2 or fe oh 3 have been considered smith et al 2008 caravelli et al 2010 hauduc et al 2015 our study reveals that fe dimers through the formation of complexes such as fe2 hpo4 oh h2o 8 3 and fe4 po4 oh 2 h2o 16 7 play a significant role during phosphate removal those transient species nevertheless leading to the thermodynamically favored fe po4 h2o 5 complex at longer times lente et al 2000 lente and fabian 2002 that the ionic background of the raw water may interfere with the hydrolytic pathway of aluminum or iron coagulants is also overlooked in traditional destabilization mechanisms duan and gregory 2003 yet in continental surface waters the average contents in silica sulfate phosphate and chloride anions meybeck and helmer 1989 are in sufficient amounts to modify the polymerization of hydrolyzing metal salts el samrani et al 2006 it is nevertheless rather difficult to precisely elucidate for a given fe p ratio both the number and various types of coagulant species exafs and even more tem edxs only provide an average description of the hydrolysis products present in the bulk solution if iron oligomers linked by a phosphate tetrahedron may lead to polycations such as fe4 po4 oh 2 h2o 16 7 those highly charged species do not account by themselves for the destabilization of silica nanoparticles under the conditions of ph and ionic strength used in this study the surface charge density of ludox nanoparticles is about 1 6 μc cm 2 bolt 1957 allison 2009 this corresponds to 61 negatively charged sio groups per silica particle in that case the number of polycations of charge 7 necessary to neutralize the silica surface would be less than 10 as a 500 mg l ludox hs suspension corresponds to a 1 58 1017 particles per liter a fe concentration of 9 4 μmol l should then be theoretically sufficient to achieve the neutralization of silica nanoparticles the latter concentration is two orders of magnitude less than the actual coagulant concentration used therefore the coagulant species present in suspension are certainly a mix of weakly positive hydrolyzed products comprising on the average about 4 5 fe atoms for one p atom as the saxs curves do not reveal any increase in the radius of elementary particles with p addition the size of coagulant species is expected to remain in the lower nanometer range in that context a sweep flocculation mechanism characterized by the formation of an abundant precipitate enmeshing the silica nanoparticles seems rather unlikely especially in the underdosing range moreover the examination of tem micrographs does not reveal the presence of an abundant hydroxide precipitate see fig s2 in supporting information a simple charge neutralization mechanism can also be argued since the electrophoretic mobility of silica aggregates is negative however a hetero aggregation process involving negative silica particles attached by positive nanosize coagulant species may reconcile all the observations in that framework a local charge neutralization within the aggregate is sufficient to ensure the build up of aggregates the negative electrophoretic mobility being explained by the terminal attachment of partially neutralized and still negative silica particles in excess at the outer part of aggregates the linear decrease in residual turbidity and the concomitant increase in aggregate size observed with increasing phosphate concentration when using an underdose of iron coagulant figs 3 and 4b are also consistent with a hetero aggregation framework indeed when mixing large and small oppositely charged particles previous research has shown that below the destabilization threshold the number of hetero aggregates obtained decreases linearly with the relative number of large and small particles dumont et al 1990 in our case a small addition of phosphate ligand determines an increase in the overall number of nanosize coagulant species and hence promotes the growth of larger aggregates thus improving their settleability although limited to less than a decade in q an estimate of about 1 7 for the fractal exponent of silica aggregates is consistent with a diffusion limited cluster aggregation dlca meakin 1987 such dlca regime can be argued because the aggregates are formed in a stirred vessel the relative importance of shear aggregation to brownian diffusion can assessed using the péclet number pe 6πηgd0 3 kt in which η is the dynamic viscosity of the suspension η 1 07 10 6 m2s 1 g the average velocity gradient g 135 s 1 d0 the radius of silica particles d0 7 nm k the boltzmann constant and t the absolute temperature frappier et al 2010 in the early stage of aggregation pe is about 2 10 7 which suggests that brownian aggregation is largely predominant over shear aggregation and governs the aggregate structure investigated by saxs for micron size aggregates the two aggregation modes become equivalent the slightly higher df value of 1 83 obtained below a fe p ratio of 7 can also be explained by the same dlca aggregation regime provided that some reorganization of aggregates is allowed meakin and julien 1988 wu et al 2013 have recently shown that thermal restructuring may drive an increase in the fractal dimension of dlca aggregates that is more pronounced with a decrease in the radius of primary particles for silica nanoparticles having a radius of 7 nm a df value of about 1 9 can be expected if the bonds between primary particles are weak wu et al 2013 accordingly this suggests that the bonds formed from the coagulant species between the silica particles are strong and even rigid above a fe p of 7 and that some restructuring of aggregates occurs below a fe p of 7 because of the slightly different nature of coagulant species that leads to a lower binding energy between the particles 5 conclusions the aggregation of silica nanoparticles with ferric chloride was studied in the presence of small amounts of phosphate ligand the characteristics of aggregates formed were described using a combination of techniques i e laser granulometry turbidity measurements saxs tem edxs microanalysis and exafs at the fe k edge we found that the addition of phosphate dramatically modifies the nature of hydrolysis products without changing the aggregation mechanism the phosphate ligands terminate the polymerization of fe octahedra chains to lead to an increasing number of fe oligomers bridged by phosphate tetrahedra an elemental ratio fe p of about 7 appears optimal for the production of efficient positively charged coagulant species the saxs results indicate that the size of those coagulant species remains in the nanoscale range and reveal that a diffusion limited cluster aggregation governs the structure of aggregates in the early stage of aggregation the prevalence of non equilibrium fe p species formed in the course of chemical coagulation of silica particles suggests that thermodynamic approaches of phosphorus removal with iron or aluminum coagulants are not of much use instead the relative contents in hydrolyzing metal coagulant and in complexing anions in the raw water to be treated coupled with a partial charge model jolivet 2019 might be better suited for describing the coagulant species likely to be formed our results demonstrate the usefulness of coupling microscopic and spectroscopic approaches to clear

18566,elucidating the extracellular polymeric substances eps of anammox granular sludge is important for stable nitrogen removal processes in wastewater treatment however due to a lack of standardized methods for extraction and characterization the composition of anammox granule eps remains mostly unknown in this study alkaline naoh and ionic liquid il extractions were compared in terms of the proteins they extracted from different candidatus brocadia cultures we aimed to identify structural proteins and evaluated to which extend these extraction methods bias the outcome of eps characterization extraction was focussed on solubilization of the eps matrix and the naoh and il extraction recovered on average 20 and 26 of the vss respectively using two extraction methods targeting different intermolecular interactions increased the possibility of identifying structural extracellular proteins of the extracted proteins 40 were common between the extraction methods the high number of common abundant proteins between the extraction methods illustrated how extraction biases can be reduced when solubility of the granular sludge is enhanced physicochemical analyses of the granules indicated that extracellular structural matrix proteins likely have β sheet dominated secondary structures these β sheet structures were measured in eps extracted with both methods the high number of uncharacterized proteins and possible moonlighting proteins confounded identifying structural i e β sheet dominant proteins nonetheless new candidates for structural matrix proteins are described further current bottlenecks in assigning specific proteins to key extracellular functions in anammox granular sludge are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords anammox granular sludge eps ionic liquids alkaline extraction extracellular protein β sheet 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox a process involving the oxidation of ammonium to dinitrogen gas with nitrite as electron acceptor is significant across many biogeochemical landscapes de brabandere et al 2014 kalvelage et al 2013 yang et al 2015 the means to transform ammonium to nitrogen gas without oxygen also makes it a very attractive nitrogen removal process in wastewater treatment where aeration is a major operating cost for complete nitrification since its discovery almost thirty years ago mulder 1989 more than 100 full scale applications have been commissioned in which anammox is coupled with partial nitritation lackner et al 2014 this includes a wide spectrum of wastewaters that can be treated by anammox from digester effluents van der star et al 2007 black water from source separated sanitation vlaeminck et al 2009 to various industrial wastewaters with low c n ratio lackner et al 2014 the configuration of the process ranges from two stage to single stage applying to either mainstream or side stream wastewater treatment plants currently there is a strong emphasis on developing anammox technology for mainstream municipal wastewater treatment agrawal et al 2018 cao et al 2017 hoekstra et al 2018 anammox processes rely on the immobilisation of anammox bacteria as granules or biofilms in order to reach sufficient biomass retention abma et al 2007 biofilm formation is facilitated by the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming 2011 eps are reported to consist of polysaccharides proteins dna and other polymers the tendency of their eps to mediate the formation of dense anammox biofilms is an important aspect of stable anammox reactor operation when the eps are not sufficiently stabilised this can impair the anammox process stability de graaff et al 2011 on the other hand eps production can hamper the characterization of anammox cell biology cirpus et al 2006 hence there are both cases in which eps production is desirable and in which it is not in any case it is a process with many unknowns and therefore difficult to measure or control to improve on that it is important to first understand the composition of the eps matrix in recent years much information has been obtained regarding population cell structure and compartmentalization e g anammoxosomes van teeseling et al 2013 and kinetics lotti et al 2014 for example five different genera have been identified that are capable of performing anammox peeters and van niftrik 2019 nonetheless despite their importance and ubiquity the eps are perhaps the least understood aspect of anammox communities this is largely because eps are difficult to analyse due to the fact that they are poorly soluble and compositionally heterogeneous seviour et al 2019 one major challenge or objective in eps characterization is how to link eps composition with function thus instead of focussing on the amount of eps e g proteins and polysaccharides that can be recovered the composition should be identified to resolve the exact nature boleij et al 2018 felz et al 2019 seviour et al 2019 in previous work it was shown that proteins form the dominant fraction in the eps boleij et al 2018 chen et al 2019 and anammox eps contains a relatively high amount of β sheets hou et al 2015 β sheets have the potential to self assemble into various conformations that can have structural functions in the matrix perras et al 2015 e g as fibers like silk pena francesch and demirel 2019 or amyloid like lotti et al 2019 hence β sheet rich proteins potentially have a structural function in the eps matrix the prerequisite step for recovery and identification of the structural polymers is to solubilize the eps because different biofilms have different eps various biofilms need a different treatment to be solubilized for example some aerobic granules were effectively solubilized with alkaline conditions felz et al 2016 while this treatment did not work for aerobic granules enriched with defluviicoccus pronk et al 2017 and aerobic granules enriched with ammonia oxidizing bacteria lin et al 2018 instead they were solubilized with acidic conditions and sds treatment respectively studies involving eps extraction from anammox granular sludge in general don t report the solubilization of the eps matrix two previously proposed extraction methods that were able to solubilize and recover eps of anammox granular sludge are the alkaline naoh extraction boleij et al 2018 and ionic liquid il extraction wong et al 2019 however they were never directly compared since there are no standardized extraction and characterization methods it is currently unknown if these two extraction methods lead to comparable extracted eps or not here we evaluated two different extraction methods naoh and il and analysed the extracted eps from anammox granular sludge from various reactors focussing on proteins the molecular weight distribution and the functional groups of the recovered eps were investigated as well as the secondary structure of the extracted proteins mass spectrometry ms was applied for identification of extracted proteins the recovered polymers were characterized in order to evaluate the influence of different extraction methods and better understand the underlying extraction mechanisms in addition by combining information of the characterization of eps extracted with both methods we aimed for identification of the structural components 2

5 0 software revision 4769 ab sciex using the paragon database search algorithm 5 0 0 0 4767 for peptide identification and the integrated false discovery rate fdr analysis function the data were searched against a ca brocadia database total 33264 sequences these protein data were searched against a protein reference database obtained from analysis of translated predicted genes from metagenome assemblies of the sampled reactor communities combined with protein sequence from five extant draft anaob genomes liu et al 2018 2 8 analysis of abundant protein sequences to estimate the protein abundance in the samples exponentially modified protein abundance index empai analysis was performed according to li et al 2016 the sequences of the abundant proteins obtained with the empai analysis were subjected to the predictprotein tool to predict structural and functional features yachdav et al 2014 and the protparam tool from expasy to predict physical and chemical parameters gasteiger et al 2005 3 results 3 1 characterization of the anammox granular sludge granules from three full scale municipal and industrial and one laboratory scale anammox reactor see table 1 were collected in order to extract their eps and resolve the composition the phylogenetic tree in fig 1 shows that the dominant anammox species in nlamx1 and nlamx3 cluster together and in both instances are closely related to candidatus ca brocadia sapporoensis previously ca brocadia sp 40 nlamx2 and sgamx cluster together and are closely related to ca brocadia sinica a smaller part of sgamx is closely related to ca brocadia caroliniensis fish indicated a high abundance of the anammox bacteria in the granules see supplemental figs s1 and s2 the volatile suspended solid vss content of the granules ranged from 71 to 88 table 1 in fig 2 b the inorganic part appears bright and is not only present in the core of the granules but also forms layers around the core the inorganic fraction of nlamx1 was previously determined to be hydroxyapatite lin et al 2013 in between these hydroxyapatite layers the space is filled with the organic matrix which appears as the grey part the matrix of the granules has a heterogeneous structure as was observed using electron microscopy both regions with low and high cell densities were observed in regions with low cell densities both a compact matrix and a relatively open fibrous structure can be seen fig 2c and d at the regions with high cell densities the eps appear in between the cells which glue the cells tightly to each other fig 2e and f thus the challenge for the eps characterization lies not only in the fact that the eps matrix is difficult to solubilize but also in the heterogeneous structure of the granules thioflavin t tht staining was applied to indicate β sheets in the anammox granules tht becomes strongly fluorescent when it binds to β sheet rich structures the images in fig 3 show that tht binds to the anammox granules enriched with ca brocadia sinica which indicates that β sheets are indeed a dominant secondary structure in the eps since β sheets are abundant and also found before in anammox eps lotti et al 2019 for the eps analysis in this study β sheet rich proteins will be taken into account as a candidate for structural extracellular proteins 3 2 solubilization of anammox granules by alkaline naoh and ionic liquid il treatments the granular sludge from all four anammox reactors was subjected to alkaline naoh and ionic liquid il extractions the extractions were performed according to the workflow scheme in fig 4 following naoh treatment the granular shape was lost fig 5 a indicating the dissolution of structural eps to precipitate the solubilized polymers hcl was added dropwise until the ph was decreased to ph 5 this resulted in the formation of gel like films which could be recovered by centrifugation after il treatment there is a stratification of the granular matrix into a mineral part lower layer a gel layer middle layer and a soluble layer upper layer fig 5a the upper and the middle layers were recovered the upper layer was soluble in water il sol while the middle layer was insoluble in water il gel using the naoh extraction method approximately 20 of the vss is extracted whereas with the il extraction method up to 30 of the vss is extracted fig 5b both treatments caused disintegration of the granular shape the vss components that could not be solubilized stayed in the pellet together with the inorganic part of the granules compared to the naoh and il gel fractions the il sol fraction is only a minor fraction of the eps interestingly the dried il sol fraction was a white powder while the naoh and the il gel fractions were both red harsh extraction methods were used to solubilize the granular sludge possibly leading to cell death live dead staining of the treated anammox cells fig 5c shows that il and naoh treatments resulted in more staining of the biomass by propidium iodide red than the control which indicates either greater cell permeability or dna release due to lysis however even before extraction there is a significant amount of dead cells present in the granular sludge in summary the results of the extractions showed that both extraction methods fulfil the first requirement of eps extraction namely the solubilization of the granular matrix because ionic liquid and naoh treatments damage the cells it can not be excluded that intracellular proteins are released and co extracted for convenience we will refer to the total extracted material by extracted eps the extracted eps will be characterized with a focus on potential extracellular properties e g high amount of beta sheets as was found in the granular matrix and assigning intra and extracellular proteins using mass spectrometry hereby aiming at identification of extracellular proteins and additionally validating the recovery of extracellular polymers with these extraction methods 3 3 β sheets dominate the secondary structure of extracted proteins ftir was applied in order to analyse the protein secondary structure and to explore functional groups in the extracted eps the ftir profiles of the eps from the different reactors were comparable see supplementary fig s3 thus based on the ftir the functional groups of the different granular sludge samples look similar in fig 6 the ftir spectra of extracted eps from ca brocadia sinica nlamx2 are shown as an example for the comparison of the eps extracts naoh il gel and il sol the ftir spectra of naoh extracted eps and il gel eps are similar a narrow band with a relatively sharp peak at 3280 cm 1 which is a typical peak of nh group in proteins a peak at 3050 cm 1 indicating the presence of aromatic amino acids tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine dian et al 2002 the dominant protein secondary structure are β sheets with the peak at 1635 cm 1 of naoh extracted eps and the peak at 1627 cm 1 of il gel eps barth 2007 the peak at 1150 cm 1 implies there are c o c bonds due to the crosslinking of acidic sugars e g sugars with cooh group a band at 1200 940 cm 1 with two peaks one peak at 1080 cm 1 due to the presence of po4 3 and the other one at 1040 cm 1 indicating carbohydrates in comparison the spectrum of il sol is different in the following peaks a broad band at 3700 3100 cm 1 with peak at 3280 cm 1 which is assigned to hydroxyl group oh a peak at 1654 cm 1 indicating the dominant protein secondary structure is α helix barth 2007 a band at 1200 940 cm 1 with the peak at 1080 cm 1 implying that there are carbohydrates and po4 3 groups the strong signal of po4 3 covers the peak of carbohydrates there are two extra peaks at 970 cm 1 and 910 cm 1 from po4 3 group matching with the strong signal of phosphate in addition no peak at 3050 cm 1 indicating there is little aromatic amino acids tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine dian et al 2002 and no peak at 1150 cm 1 implying there is little c o c bond from the crosslinking of acidic sugars thus naoh extracted eps and il gel eps are dominated by proteins with β sheet secondary structure while proteins in the il sol fraction is dominated with α helix secondary structure and phosphate groups especially with hydroxyl groups such as hydroxyapatite the high amount of β sheets are consistent with what was observed with the tht staining in addition to the ftir eem spectra of the three extracts were measured fig 7 and supplementary fig s4 while both naoh and il gel have a major peak at 275 340 ex em the il sol has a very small signal at those wavelengths and a major peak at 240 360 instead the 275 340 nm peak is reported to represent aromatic amino acid tryptophan the 240 360 peak is the same as the peak for the autofluorescence of hydroxyapatite ciobanu et al 2012 the high amount of tryptophan is in accordance with the ftir spectra where the 3050 cm 1 peak showed phenolic amino acids tryptophan plays an important role in the formation of β sheets as β sheet structures are dominant in the naoh and il gel samples more tryptophan is present in these fractions than in the il sol sample 3 4 protein profile of extracted eps depends more on dominant population than extraction method the protein profiles of the different extracts were compared by using sds page analysis in combination with different stains proteins neutral glycans and acidic glycans that were also indicated with ftir were stained with coomassie blue periodic acid schiff pas and alcian blue respectively in fig 8 pictures of sds page gels with extracted eps of nlamx1 representative for ca brocadia sapporoensis and nlamx2 representative for ca brocadia sinica are shown see supplementary fig s5 for all sludges il and naoh methods both extracted glycoproteins as indicated by the bands that stained positive for both coomassie blue and pas stains for nlamx1 glycoproteins were observed at 80 12 and 10 kda regardless of the extraction methods used for nlamx2 il extracted eps showed glycoprotein bands at 200 150 50 and 8 kda naoh extracted eps also showed the 8 kda band while the higher molecular weight glycoproteins appeared less resolved thus the protein profile of the extracted eps depended more on dominant population than on the extraction method in addition the alcian blue staining that is specific for glycoconjugates with an acidic character carboxylated or sulfated showed that the naoh extraction recovered more acidic polymers than the il gel which is indicated by the smear in the high molecular weight range 235 kda this was the case for both nlamx1 and nlamx2 for the il sol a larger sample amount needed to be applied to visualize the bands indicating a lower presence of proteins in this fraction 3 5 in search of structural extracellular glyco proteins to identify proteins with a potential function in the structural matrix the extracted eps from nlamx1 ca brocadia sapporoensis and sgamx ca brocadia sinica were analysed using mass spectrometry ms all fractions from the extractions were analysed to compare the results of the naoh and il methods the obtained spectra were matched against a candidatus brocadia wide database of the detected proteins in the naoh extracted eps 59 and 62 was also detected when eps was extracted with the il method for nlamx1 and sgamx respectively of the total detected proteins 41 5 and 37 1 are overlapping for nlamx1 and sgamx respectively as illustrated in fig 9 the amount of detected proteins in naoh and il extracted samples are comparable in the case of nlamx1 while for sgamx the amount of detected proteins was higher for the il extracted eps of the il soluble proteins 63 and 60 for nlamx1 and sgamx respectively are also detected in the il gel proteins supplementary fig s6 the empai method was applied to find the relative abundance of the proteins in the extracted eps a list with abundant proteins in the different fractions is shown in table 2 considering abundant proteins in the different extracts similar predicted functions could be found various enzymes proteases superoxide dismutases chaperones a heme transporter and elongation factor tu and uncharacterized proteins were found the empai analysis shows similar types of proteins that are abundant in both ca brocadia sapporoensis and ca brocadia sinica supplementary tables s1 6 the sequences of the abundant proteins were analysed with online tools expasy protparam and predictprotein that predict various physical and chemical parameters like subcellular localization secondary structure grand average of hydropathicity gravy aliphatic index and instability index of the proteins the proteins that were predicted to be extracellular proteins including secreted and fimbrium proteins all belong to the uncharacterized proteins which means that the function is still unknown among the predicted secreted proteins especially a0a1v6lwi7 was noticed for its secondary structure was predicted to contain no α helix but only β sheet 42 and loop structures 58 this is similar as in the previously identified glycoprotein in ca brocadia sapporoensis which was proposed to be a surface layer protein boleij et al 2018 and which contains 47 β sheet and 53 loop structures looking at the conserved domains present in the sequence of a0a1v6lwi7 it contains a wd40 yvtn repeat domain structurally both the wd40 and the yvtn repeated motifs form a circularised beta propeller structure which consist of seven 4 stranded beta sheets looking to the aligned pdb protein database bank homologs the structure of the protein a0a1v6lwi7 is related to the structure of a hydrazine synthase e value 9e 84 and of a surface layer protein of archaea bacteria e value 7e 54 supplementary fig s7 4 discussion 4 1 extracting eps from anammox granules with two different extraction methods the eps are responsible for the stability of biofilms and granular sludge knowledge on the composition of the eps is therefore valuable because it can aid in development of methods to monitor e g ftir online measurement and ultimately control eps production still it is a poorly characterized material this is partly due to limitations in extraction methods as well as the analytical methods felz et al 2019 seviour et al 2019 here we analysed eps of granular sludge of various anammox reactors although these four reactors are operated under different conditions two sets of dominant species were found in this study we could correlate the observations of eps characteristics to the dominant species present and not to specific reactor conditions both the naoh and il extractions method could solubilize the anammox granules used in this study which indicated that at least a part of the structural polymers of the granules was solubilized in general both naoh and il extractions recovered a range of proteins and glycosylated proteins with neutral and acidic glycoconjugates high molecular weight acidic glycoconjugates were more abundant in naoh than in il gel extracts other than that there were relatively little differences between the naoh and il gel extracts that were both recovered after the granular gel matrix was disaggregated while the il sol fraction which was recovered when the gel was not solubilized yet was only a minor fraction and had more differences compared to the two fractions above this indicates that extraction biases may be reduced when the extraction of eps is associated with solubilizing the granular matrix looking more in detail to the different fractions the proteins in both the naoh and il gel fractions had β sheets as dominant secondary structure while the proteins in the il sol fraction had α helixes as the dominant secondary structure the β sheet structure was found to be abundant in the granule indicated by tht staining this was also earlier observed for anammox granules lotti et al 2019 in addition the naoh and il gel fraction contained proteins with a high amount of tryptophan as opposed to il sol fig 7 and supplementary fig s8 tryptophan rich eps was observed in previous studies on eps of aerobic ammonium oxidizing aob granules lin et al 2018 where it was proposed to play a structural role furthermore phosphate was present in all the fractions which might relate to the hydroxyapatite accumulation in anammox granules looking at the extraction mechanisms alkaline treatment can hydrolyse sugars by beta elimination and can break disulphide bonds in proteins which can aid in the disintegration of the eps matrix nielsen and jahn 1999 solubilization by ionic liquids is based on disruption of the hydrogen bonding and its kosmotropic and chaotropic effects they are also used to stabilize proteins wong et al 2019 showed that the ionic liquid emia solubilizes neutral cellulose and cationic polysaccharide chitosan basic proteins and to a lesser extend acidic proteins it does not extract acidic polysaccharides alginate as opposed to naoh in which acidic polysaccharides are usually more soluble wendler et al 2010 consistent with these observations in this study naoh extracted more acidic glycans from the anammox granules than il the fact that the gel matrix was still present after il treatment and could only be completely solubilized after addition of the solvent dimethylacetamide could indicate a structural role of acidic glycans in the eps matrix concerning eps extraction the choice of the extraction method is dependent on the type of biofilm and on the components that are targeted to study the structural eps it is very important to solubilize the biofilm first when the composition of the biofilm is unknown it is suggested to perform a screening of extraction methods to see which one can dissolve the matrix of the biofilm in the current case both extraction methods satisfy the requirement of disaggregating the granular structure the choice is then dependent on the targeted components and follow up analyses when anionic components are the target of interest naoh is likely more suitable than the ionic liquid emia other ionic liquids than emia could be more effective for solubilization of acidic glycans since ionic liquids are also used to stabilize proteins if tertiary structures need to be preserved for analysis the il treatment can have advantages over naoh treatment which is more prone to cause some hydrolysis of proteins and sugars and deacetylation of sugars here both methods have shown useful to solubilize and characterize the eps of anammox granular sludge considering the observed damage to the cells during eps extraction both methods are likely to cause significant damage it is worth pointing out that in order to solubilize the structural part of the biofilm cell damage might be unavoidable during eps extraction especially when the granules have compact and strong structures cell lysis will be further discussed in the next section 4 2 in search of structural extracellular proteins besides the characterization of the structural features and functional groups ms was applied in order to identify the extracted proteins looking at the list of the most abundant identified proteins it contains intracellular proteins and uncharacterized proteins remarkably various metabolic enzymes chaperones and elongation factor tu have been reported in literature as moonlighting proteins amblee and jeffery 2015 a moonlighting protein is a single protein that can have two or more functions ebner et al 2016 they can have different intra and extracellular roles many of the reported moonlighting proteins work on the cell surface as an adhesin and can bind to structural components like fibronectin laminin collagen or to mucin amblee and jeffery 2015 these kind of moonlighting proteins were also observed in clostridium acetobutylicum liu et al 2018 and staphylococcus aureus foulston et al 2013 biofilms and were proposed to play a role in biofilm formation in this study we cannot differentiate between possible moonlighting proteins or intracellular proteins that were released during the extractions however the possibility of intracellular proteins having an extracellular role underlines that it is very difficult to quantify cell lysis during eps extraction during the natural development of granular sludge intracellular proteins whether through active secretion or as a result of cell death can end up in the extracellular matrix wingender et al 1999 hence they could already be present before the extraction is applied and could not be distinguished as intracellular or extracellular proteins nevertheless it is highly likely that there are lysis products released with both extraction methods therefore as proposed by seviour et al 2019 the extracellular location of the isolated polymers should always be verified location of potential targets can be verified with specific stains antibodies or lectins as was for done glycoproteins for example as described in boleij et al 2018 4 3 characterizing the uncharacterized proteins with the ms analysis no match was obtained that directed to obvious structural extracellular proteins likely the proteins that belong to the matrix polymers are among the uncharacterized proteins in order to clarify the potential function of uncharacterized proteins online tools can be used to predict structure subcellular localization and conserved domains ijaq et al 2015 the protein a0a1v6lwi7 was noticed because it was predicted to be secreted and to have a secondary structure with a high percentage of β sheets the protein has a wd40 yvtn repeat domain which in general forms structures called β propellers chen et al 2011 these β propellers can have various amounts of blades for this protein a 7 bladed β propeller structure is predicted which is reported to have significantly high thermostability and or thermodynamic stability pons et al 2012 looking to the aligned pdb structures the structure of the protein a0a1v6lwi7 is related to hydrazine synthase kartal and keltjens 2016 on the other hand the structure was also related to a surface layer protein of archaea bacteria which was proposed to have a role in cell cell interactions jing et al 2002 the latter would be interesting considering a role in the extracellular matrix the protein a0a1v6lwi7 is a potential target to be analysed in more detail regarding the function in granular sludge moreover localization using e g antibodies should be performed to verify it is indeed a secreted protein or an intracellular protein or perhaps both in general confidence scores for the localization of the proteins using the prediction tool were low supplementary table s7 this could be due to anammox bacteria having a unique cell compartmentalization with intracellular membranes unique ladderane membrane lipids and no standard gram negative or gram positive cell wall the ms analysis might have not detected or underestimated part of the extracted proteins this could be due to recalcitrant proteins not entering the sds page gel or due to glycosylation protecting the protein against tryptic digestion resulting in fewer detected peptides another issue is that the database is limited since it consists of proteins that were annotated from a draft genome for example the sequence entry matching the previously identified abundant glycoprotein of ca brocadia sapporoensis boleij et al 2018 is retracted from the database when matching the sequence of this protein against the ms spectra of the eps in this study it does not come up as an abundant protein while the band on sds page was very abundant to increase the chance to detect structural matrix proteins the samples preparation needs to be optimised specifically for the more recalcitrant eps proteins e g by including a deglycosylation step 4 4 concept of the anammox extracellular matrix and outlook based on what is currently known we can make a concept of the organization of the extracellular matrix of anammox granules in this study and also in previous studies johansson et al 2017 lin et al 2013 hydroxyapatite is observed as a part of anammox granules the eps matrix may contain the proteins that function as a template for hydroxyapatite formation and thereby provide the mineral skeleton within granules for example phosphorylated proteins and acidic groups are both reported to be involved in biomineralization ehrlich 2010 kawasaki and weiss 2006 furthermore β sheet rich proteins present on the cell surface forming the glue in between the cells and the matrix may be s layer proteins and or adhesins to elucidate the extracellular matrix of anammox granules the individual components need to be analysed in more detail for example the glycoprotein for ca brocadia sapporoensis boleij et al 2018 and for ca brocadia sinica wong et al 2019 were already characterized in more detail 5 conclusions global proteomics studies have shed huge insight into many biological processes however their application to assigning major structural extracellular proteins is limited by extraction techniques protein solubility and digestibility and poor representation of extracellular proteins in the reference databases we addressed the issue of extraction and solubility and observed that while using different extraction methods increases the number of proteins detected nonetheless the main ones were largely common we observed by microscopy that the matrix is dominated by β sheet structures and confirmed that the extracted proteins had predominately β sheet structures hence we believe that we extracted structural proteins however we could not assign any of the proteins identified from the different extracts by ms as being dominant structural proteins due to the high number of uncharacterized proteins potential for moonlighting functions among proteins and the lack of biophysical data regarding the structures of many of these proteins nonetheless the extraction methods described here enable the biochemical e g isolation and biophysical approaches needed to fill in the blanks in the protein

18566,elucidating the extracellular polymeric substances eps of anammox granular sludge is important for stable nitrogen removal processes in wastewater treatment however due to a lack of standardized methods for extraction and characterization the composition of anammox granule eps remains mostly unknown in this study alkaline naoh and ionic liquid il extractions were compared in terms of the proteins they extracted from different candidatus brocadia cultures we aimed to identify structural proteins and evaluated to which extend these extraction methods bias the outcome of eps characterization extraction was focussed on solubilization of the eps matrix and the naoh and il extraction recovered on average 20 and 26 of the vss respectively using two extraction methods targeting different intermolecular interactions increased the possibility of identifying structural extracellular proteins of the extracted proteins 40 were common between the extraction methods the high number of common abundant proteins between the extraction methods illustrated how extraction biases can be reduced when solubility of the granular sludge is enhanced physicochemical analyses of the granules indicated that extracellular structural matrix proteins likely have β sheet dominated secondary structures these β sheet structures were measured in eps extracted with both methods the high number of uncharacterized proteins and possible moonlighting proteins confounded identifying structural i e β sheet dominant proteins nonetheless new candidates for structural matrix proteins are

electron acceptor is significant across many biogeochemical landscapes de brabandere et al 2014 kalvelage et al 2013 yang et al 2015 the means to transform ammonium to nitrogen gas without oxygen also makes it a very attractive nitrogen removal process in wastewater treatment where aeration is a major operating cost for complete nitrification since its discovery almost thirty years ago mulder 1989 more than 100 full scale applications have been commissioned in which anammox is coupled with partial nitritation lackner et al 2014 this includes a wide spectrum of wastewaters that can be treated by anammox from digester effluents van der star et al 2007 black water from source separated sanitation vlaeminck et al 2009 to various industrial wastewaters with low c n ratio lackner et al 2014 the configuration of the process ranges from two stage to single stage applying to either mainstream or side stream wastewater treatment plants currently there is a strong emphasis on developing anammox technology for mainstream municipal wastewater treatment agrawal et al 2018 cao et al 2017 hoekstra et al 2018 anammox processes rely on the immobilisation of anammox bacteria as granules or biofilms in order to reach sufficient biomass retention abma et al 2007 biofilm formation is facilitated by the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps flemming 2011 eps are reported to consist of polysaccharides proteins dna and other polymers the tendency of their eps to mediate the formation of dense anammox biofilms is an important aspect of stable anammox reactor operation when the eps are not sufficiently stabilised this can impair the anammox process stability de graaff et al 2011 on the other hand eps production can hamper the characterization of anammox cell biology cirpus et al 2006 hence there are both cases in which eps production is desirable and in which it is not in any case it is a process with many unknowns and therefore difficult to measure or control to improve on that it is important to first understand the composition of the eps matrix in recent years much information has been obtained regarding population cell structure and compartmentalization e g anammoxosomes van teeseling et al 2013 and kinetics lotti et al 2014 for example five different genera have been identified that are capable of performing anammox peeters and van niftrik 2019 nonetheless despite their importance and ubiquity the eps are perhaps the least understood aspect of anammox communities this is largely because eps are difficult to analyse due to the fact that they are poorly soluble and compositionally heterogeneous seviour et al 2019 one major challenge or objective in eps characterization is how to link eps composition with function thus instead of focussing on the amount of eps e g proteins and polysaccharides that can be recovered the composition should be identified to resolve the exact nature boleij et al 2018 felz et al 2019 seviour et al 2019 in previous work it was shown that proteins form the dominant fraction in the eps boleij et al 2018 chen et al 2019 and anammox eps contains a relatively high amount of β sheets hou et al 2015 β sheets have the potential to self assemble into various conformations that can have structural functions in the matrix perras et al 2015 e g as fibers like silk pena francesch and demirel 2019 or amyloid like lotti et al 2019 hence β sheet rich proteins potentially have a structural function in the eps matrix the prerequisite step for recovery and identification of the structural polymers is to solubilize the eps because different biofilms have different eps various biofilms need a different treatment to be solubilized for example some aerobic granules were effectively solubilized with alkaline conditions felz et al 2016 while this treatment did not work for aerobic granules enriched with defluviicoccus pronk et al 2017 and aerobic granules enriched with ammonia oxidizing bacteria lin et al 2018 instead they were solubilized with acidic conditions and sds treatment respectively studies involving eps extraction from anammox granular sludge in general don t report the solubilization of the eps matrix two previously proposed extraction methods that were able to solubilize and recover eps of anammox granular sludge are the alkaline naoh extraction boleij et al 2018 and ionic liquid il extraction wong et al 2019 however they were never directly compared since there are no standardized extraction and characterization methods it is currently unknown if these two extraction methods lead to comparable extracted eps or not here we evaluated two different extraction methods naoh and il and analysed the extracted eps from anammox granular sludge from various reactors focussing on proteins the molecular weight distribution and the functional groups of the recovered eps were investigated as well as the secondary structure of the extracted proteins mass spectrometry ms was applied for identification of extracted proteins the recovered polymers were characterized in order to evaluate the influence of different extraction methods and better understand the underlying extraction mechanisms in addition by combining information of the characterization of eps extracted with both methods we aimed for identification of the structural components 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and characterization of anammox granular sludge anammox granular sludge samples were collected from three full scale plants in the netherlands nlamx1 nlamx2 and nlamx3 as well as from a lab scale reactor in singapore sgamx the characteristics of all reactors are shown in table 1 a clone library analysis was performed to identify the dominant anammox species

searched against a ca brocadia database total 33264 sequences these protein data were searched against a protein reference database obtained from analysis of translated predicted genes from metagenome assemblies of the sampled reactor communities combined with protein sequence from five extant draft anaob genomes liu et al 2018 2 8 analysis of abundant protein sequences to estimate the protein abundance in the samples exponentially modified protein abundance index empai analysis was performed according to li et al 2016 the sequences of the abundant proteins obtained with the empai analysis were subjected to the predictprotein tool to predict structural and functional features yachdav et al 2014 and the protparam tool from expasy to predict physical and chemical parameters gasteiger et al 2005 3 results 3 1 characterization of the anammox granular sludge granules from three full scale municipal and industrial and one laboratory scale anammox reactor see table 1 were collected in order to extract their eps and resolve the composition the phylogenetic tree in fig 1 shows that the dominant anammox species in nlamx1 and nlamx3 cluster together and in both instances are closely related to candidatus ca brocadia sapporoensis previously ca brocadia sp 40 nlamx2 and sgamx cluster together and are closely related to ca brocadia sinica a smaller part of sgamx is closely related to ca brocadia caroliniensis fish indicated a high abundance of the anammox bacteria in the granules see supplemental figs s1 and s2 the volatile suspended solid vss content of the granules ranged from 71 to 88 table 1 in fig 2 b the inorganic part appears bright and is not only present in the core of the granules but also forms layers around the core the inorganic fraction of nlamx1 was previously determined to be hydroxyapatite lin et al 2013 in between these hydroxyapatite layers the space is filled with the organic matrix which appears as the grey part the matrix of the granules has a heterogeneous structure as was observed using electron microscopy both regions with low and high cell densities were observed in regions with low cell densities both a compact matrix and a relatively open fibrous structure can be seen fig 2c and d at the regions with high cell densities the eps appear in between the cells which glue the cells tightly to each other fig 2e and f thus the challenge for the eps characterization lies not only in the fact that the eps matrix is difficult to solubilize but also in the heterogeneous structure of the granules thioflavin t tht staining was applied to indicate β sheets in the anammox granules tht becomes strongly fluorescent when it binds to β sheet rich structures the images in fig 3 show that tht binds to the anammox granules enriched with ca brocadia sinica which indicates that β sheets are indeed a dominant secondary structure in the eps since β sheets are abundant and also found before in anammox eps lotti et al 2019 for the eps analysis in this study β sheet rich proteins will be taken into account as a candidate for structural extracellular proteins 3 2 solubilization of anammox granules by alkaline naoh and ionic liquid il treatments the granular sludge from all four anammox reactors was subjected to alkaline naoh and ionic liquid il extractions the extractions were performed according to the workflow scheme in fig 4 following naoh treatment the granular shape was lost fig 5 a indicating the dissolution of structural eps to precipitate the solubilized polymers hcl was added dropwise until the ph was decreased to ph 5 this resulted in the formation of gel like films which could be recovered by centrifugation after il treatment there is a stratification of the granular matrix into a mineral part lower layer a gel layer middle layer and a soluble layer upper layer fig 5a the upper and the middle layers were recovered the upper layer was soluble in water il sol while the middle layer was insoluble in water il gel using the naoh extraction method approximately 20 of the vss is extracted whereas with the il extraction method up to 30 of the vss is extracted fig 5b both treatments caused disintegration of the granular shape the vss components that could not be solubilized stayed in the pellet together with the inorganic part of the granules compared to the naoh and il gel fractions the il sol fraction is only a minor fraction of the eps interestingly the dried il sol fraction was a white powder while the naoh and the il gel fractions were both red harsh extraction methods were used to solubilize the granular sludge possibly leading to cell death live dead staining of the treated anammox cells fig 5c shows that il and naoh treatments resulted in more staining of the biomass by propidium iodide red than the control which indicates either greater cell permeability or dna release due to lysis however even before extraction there is a significant amount of dead cells present in the granular sludge in summary the results of the extractions showed that both extraction methods fulfil the first requirement of eps extraction namely the solubilization of the granular matrix because ionic liquid and naoh treatments damage the cells it can not be excluded that intracellular proteins are released and co extracted for convenience we will refer to the total extracted material by extracted eps the extracted eps will be characterized with a focus on potential extracellular properties e g high amount of beta sheets as was found in the granular matrix and assigning intra and extracellular proteins using mass spectrometry hereby aiming at identification of extracellular proteins and additionally validating the recovery of extracellular polymers with these extraction methods 3 3 β sheets dominate the secondary structure of extracted proteins ftir was applied in order to analyse the protein secondary structure and to explore functional groups in the extracted eps the ftir profiles of the eps from the different reactors were comparable see supplementary fig s3 thus based on the ftir the functional groups of the different granular sludge samples look similar in fig 6 the ftir spectra of extracted eps from ca brocadia sinica nlamx2 are shown as an example for the comparison of the eps extracts naoh il gel and il sol the ftir spectra of naoh extracted eps and il gel eps are similar a narrow band with a relatively sharp peak at 3280 cm 1 which is a typical peak of nh group in proteins a peak at 3050 cm 1 indicating the presence of aromatic amino acids tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine dian et al 2002 the dominant protein secondary structure are β sheets with the peak at 1635 cm 1 of naoh extracted eps and the peak at 1627 cm 1 of il gel eps barth 2007 the peak at 1150 cm 1 implies there are c o c bonds due to the crosslinking of acidic sugars e g sugars with cooh group a band at 1200 940 cm 1 with two peaks one peak at 1080 cm 1 due to the presence of po4 3 and the other one at 1040 cm 1 indicating carbohydrates in comparison the spectrum of il sol is different in the following peaks a broad band at 3700 3100 cm 1 with peak at 3280 cm 1 which is assigned to hydroxyl group oh a peak at 1654 cm 1 indicating the dominant protein secondary structure is α helix barth 2007 a band at 1200 940 cm 1 with the peak at 1080 cm 1 implying that there are carbohydrates and po4 3 groups the strong signal of po4 3 covers the peak of carbohydrates there are two extra peaks at 970 cm 1 and 910 cm 1 from po4 3 group matching with the strong signal of phosphate in addition no peak at 3050 cm 1 indicating there is little aromatic amino acids tryptophan tyrosine and phenylalanine dian et al 2002 and no peak at 1150 cm 1 implying there is little c o c bond from the crosslinking of acidic sugars thus naoh extracted eps and il gel eps are dominated by proteins with β sheet secondary structure while proteins in the il sol fraction is dominated with α helix secondary structure and phosphate groups especially with hydroxyl groups such as hydroxyapatite the high amount of β sheets are consistent with what was observed with the tht staining in addition to the ftir eem spectra of the three extracts were measured fig 7 and supplementary fig s4 while both naoh and il gel have a major peak at 275 340 ex em the il sol has a very small signal at those wavelengths and a major peak at 240 360 instead the 275 340 nm peak is reported to represent aromatic amino acid tryptophan the 240 360 peak is the same as the peak for the autofluorescence of hydroxyapatite ciobanu et al 2012 the high amount of tryptophan is in accordance with the ftir spectra where the 3050 cm 1 peak showed phenolic amino acids tryptophan plays an important role in the formation of β sheets as β sheet structures are dominant in the naoh and il gel samples more tryptophan is present in these fractions than in the il sol sample 3 4 protein profile of extracted eps depends more on dominant population than extraction method the protein profiles of the different extracts were compared by using sds page analysis in combination with different stains proteins neutral glycans and acidic glycans that were also indicated with ftir were stained with coomassie blue periodic acid schiff pas and alcian blue respectively in fig 8 pictures of sds page gels with extracted eps of nlamx1 representative for ca brocadia sapporoensis and nlamx2 representative for ca brocadia sinica are shown see supplementary fig s5 for all sludges il and naoh methods both extracted glycoproteins as indicated by the bands that stained positive for both coomassie blue and pas stains for nlamx1 glycoproteins were observed at 80 12 and 10 kda regardless of the extraction methods used for nlamx2 il extracted eps showed glycoprotein bands at 200 150 50 and 8 kda naoh extracted eps also showed the 8 kda band while the higher molecular weight glycoproteins appeared less resolved thus the protein profile of the extracted eps depended more on dominant population than on the extraction method in addition the alcian blue staining that is specific for glycoconjugates with an acidic character carboxylated or sulfated showed that the naoh extraction recovered more acidic polymers than the il gel which is indicated by the smear in the high molecular weight range 235 kda this was the case for both nlamx1 and nlamx2 for the il sol a larger sample amount needed to be applied to visualize the bands indicating a lower presence of proteins in this fraction 3 5 in search of structural extracellular glyco proteins to identify proteins with a potential function in the structural matrix the extracted eps from nlamx1 ca brocadia sapporoensis and sgamx ca brocadia sinica were analysed using mass spectrometry ms all fractions from the extractions were analysed to compare the results of the naoh and il methods the obtained spectra were matched against a candidatus brocadia wide database of the detected proteins in the naoh extracted eps 59 and 62 was also detected when eps was extracted with the il method for nlamx1 and sgamx respectively of the total detected proteins 41 5 and 37 1 are overlapping for nlamx1 and sgamx respectively as illustrated in fig 9 the amount of detected proteins in naoh and il extracted samples are comparable in the case of nlamx1 while for sgamx the amount of detected proteins was higher for the il extracted eps of the il soluble proteins 63 and 60 for nlamx1 and sgamx respectively are also detected in the il gel proteins supplementary fig s6 the empai method was applied to find the relative abundance of the proteins in the extracted eps a list with abundant proteins in the different fractions is shown in table 2 considering abundant proteins in the different extracts similar predicted functions could be found various enzymes proteases superoxide dismutases chaperones a heme transporter and elongation factor tu and uncharacterized proteins were found the empai analysis shows similar types of proteins that are abundant in both ca brocadia sapporoensis and ca brocadia sinica supplementary tables s1 6 the sequences of the abundant proteins were analysed with online tools expasy protparam and predictprotein that predict various physical and chemical parameters like subcellular localization secondary structure grand average of hydropathicity gravy aliphatic index and instability index of the proteins the proteins that were predicted to be extracellular proteins including secreted and fimbrium proteins all belong to the uncharacterized proteins which means that the function is still unknown among the predicted secreted proteins especially a0a1v6lwi7 was noticed for its secondary structure was predicted to contain no α helix but only β sheet 42 and loop structures 58 this is similar as in the previously identified glycoprotein in ca brocadia sapporoensis which was proposed to be a surface layer protein boleij et al 2018 and which contains 47 β sheet and 53 loop structures looking at the conserved domains present in the sequence of a0a1v6lwi7 it contains a wd40 yvtn repeat domain structurally both the wd40 and the yvtn repeated motifs form a circularised beta propeller structure which consist of seven 4 stranded beta sheets looking to the aligned pdb protein database bank homologs the structure of the protein a0a1v6lwi7 is related to the structure of a hydrazine synthase e value 9e 84 and of a surface layer protein of archaea bacteria e value 7e 54 supplementary fig s7 4 discussion 4 1 extracting eps from anammox granules with two different extraction methods the eps are responsible for the stability of biofilms and granular sludge knowledge on the composition of the eps is therefore valuable because it can aid in development of methods to monitor e g ftir online measurement and ultimately control eps production still it is a poorly characterized material this is partly due to limitations in extraction methods as well as the analytical methods felz et al 2019 seviour et al 2019 here we analysed eps of granular sludge of various anammox reactors although these four reactors are operated under different conditions two sets of dominant species were found in this study we could correlate the observations of eps characteristics to the dominant species present and not to specific reactor conditions both the naoh and il extractions method could solubilize the anammox granules used in this study which indicated that at least a part of the structural polymers of the granules was solubilized in general both naoh and il extractions recovered a range of proteins and glycosylated proteins with neutral and acidic glycoconjugates high molecular weight acidic glycoconjugates were more abundant in naoh than in il gel extracts other than that there were relatively little differences between the naoh and il gel extracts that were both recovered after the granular gel matrix was disaggregated while the il sol fraction which was recovered when the gel was not solubilized yet was only a minor fraction and had more differences compared to the two fractions above this indicates that extraction biases may be reduced when the extraction of eps is associated with solubilizing the granular matrix looking more in detail to the different fractions the proteins in both the naoh and il gel fractions had β sheets as dominant secondary structure while the proteins in the il sol fraction had α helixes as the dominant secondary structure the β sheet structure was found to be abundant in the granule indicated by tht staining this was also earlier observed for anammox granules lotti et al 2019 in addition the naoh and il gel fraction contained proteins with a high amount of tryptophan as opposed to il sol fig 7 and supplementary fig s8 tryptophan rich eps was observed in previous studies on eps of aerobic ammonium oxidizing aob granules lin et al 2018 where it was proposed to play a structural role furthermore phosphate was present in all the fractions which might relate to the hydroxyapatite accumulation in anammox granules looking at the extraction mechanisms alkaline treatment can hydrolyse sugars by beta elimination and can break disulphide bonds in proteins which can aid in the disintegration of the eps matrix nielsen and jahn 1999 solubilization by ionic liquids is based on disruption of the hydrogen bonding and its kosmotropic and chaotropic effects they are also used to stabilize proteins wong et al 2019 showed that the ionic liquid emia solubilizes neutral cellulose and cationic polysaccharide chitosan basic proteins and to a lesser extend acidic proteins it does not extract acidic polysaccharides alginate as opposed to naoh in which acidic polysaccharides are usually more soluble wendler et al 2010 consistent with these observations in this study naoh extracted more acidic glycans from the anammox granules than il the fact that the gel matrix was still present after il treatment and could only be completely solubilized after addition of the solvent dimethylacetamide could indicate a structural role of acidic glycans in the eps matrix concerning eps extraction the choice of the extraction method is dependent on the type of biofilm and on the components that are targeted to study the structural eps it is very important to solubilize the biofilm first when the composition of the biofilm is unknown it is suggested to perform a screening of extraction methods to see which one can dissolve the matrix of the biofilm in the current case both extraction methods satisfy the requirement of disaggregating the granular structure the choice is then dependent on the targeted components and follow up analyses when anionic components are the target of interest naoh is likely more suitable than the ionic liquid emia other ionic liquids than emia could be more effective for solubilization of acidic glycans since ionic liquids are also used to stabilize proteins if tertiary structures need to be preserved for analysis the il treatment can have advantages over naoh treatment which is more prone to cause some hydrolysis of proteins and sugars and deacetylation of sugars here both methods have shown useful to solubilize and characterize the eps of anammox granular sludge considering the observed damage to the cells during eps extraction both methods are likely to cause significant damage it is worth pointing out that in order to solubilize the structural part of the biofilm cell damage might be unavoidable during eps extraction especially when the granules have compact and strong structures cell lysis will be further discussed in the next section 4 2 in search of structural extracellular proteins besides the characterization of the structural features and functional groups ms was applied in order to identify the extracted proteins looking at the list of the most abundant identified proteins it contains intracellular proteins and uncharacterized proteins remarkably various metabolic enzymes chaperones and elongation factor tu have been reported in literature as moonlighting proteins amblee and jeffery 2015 a moonlighting protein is a single protein that can have two or more functions ebner et al 2016 they can have different intra and extracellular roles many of the reported moonlighting proteins work on the cell surface as an adhesin and can bind to structural components like fibronectin laminin collagen or to mucin amblee and jeffery 2015 these kind of moonlighting proteins were also observed in clostridium acetobutylicum liu et al 2018 and staphylococcus aureus foulston et al 2013 biofilms and were proposed to play a role in biofilm formation in this study we cannot differentiate between possible moonlighting proteins or intracellular proteins that were released during the extractions however the possibility of intracellular proteins having an extracellular role underlines that it is very difficult to quantify cell lysis during eps extraction during the natural development of granular sludge intracellular proteins whether through active secretion or as a result of cell death can end up in the extracellular matrix wingender et al 1999 hence they could already be present before the extraction is applied and could not be distinguished as intracellular or extracellular proteins nevertheless it is highly likely that there are lysis products released with both extraction methods therefore as proposed by seviour et al 2019 the extracellular location of the isolated polymers should always be verified location of potential targets can be verified with specific stains antibodies or lectins as was for done glycoproteins for example as described in boleij et al 2018 4 3 characterizing the uncharacterized proteins with the ms analysis no match was obtained that directed to obvious structural extracellular proteins likely the proteins that belong to the matrix polymers are among the uncharacterized proteins in order to clarify the potential function of uncharacterized proteins online tools can be used to predict structure subcellular localization and conserved domains ijaq et al 2015 the protein a0a1v6lwi7 was noticed because it was predicted to be secreted and to have a secondary structure with a high percentage of β sheets the protein has a wd40 yvtn repeat domain which in general forms structures called β propellers chen et al 2011 these β propellers can have various amounts of blades for this protein a 7 bladed β propeller structure is predicted which is reported to have significantly high thermostability and or thermodynamic stability pons et al 2012 looking to the aligned pdb structures the structure of the protein a0a1v6lwi7 is related to hydrazine synthase kartal and keltjens 2016 on the other hand the structure was also related to a surface layer protein of archaea bacteria which was proposed to have a role in cell cell interactions jing et al 2002 the latter would be interesting considering a role in the extracellular matrix the protein a0a1v6lwi7 is a potential target to be analysed in more detail regarding the function in granular sludge moreover localization using e g antibodies should be performed to verify it is indeed a secreted protein or an intracellular protein or perhaps both in general confidence scores for the localization of the proteins using the prediction tool were low supplementary table s7 this could be due to anammox bacteria having a unique cell compartmentalization with intracellular membranes unique ladderane membrane lipids and no standard gram negative or gram positive cell wall the ms analysis might have not detected or underestimated part of the extracted proteins this could be due to recalcitrant proteins not entering the sds page gel or due to glycosylation protecting the protein against tryptic digestion resulting in fewer detected peptides another issue is that the database is limited since it consists of proteins that were annotated from a draft genome for example the sequence entry matching the previously identified abundant glycoprotein of ca brocadia sapporoensis boleij et al 2018 is retracted from the database when matching the sequence of this protein against the ms spectra of the eps in this study it does not come up as an abundant protein while the band on sds page was very abundant to increase the chance to detect structural matrix proteins the samples preparation needs to be optimised specifically for the more recalcitrant eps proteins e g by including a deglycosylation step 4 4 concept of the anammox extracellular matrix and outlook based on what is currently known we can make a concept of the organization of the extracellular matrix of anammox granules in this study and also in previous studies johansson et al 2017 lin et al 2013 hydroxyapatite is observed as a part of anammox granules the eps matrix may contain the proteins that function as a template for hydroxyapatite formation and thereby provide the mineral skeleton within granules for example phosphorylated proteins and acidic groups are both reported to be involved in biomineralization ehrlich 2010 kawasaki and weiss 2006 furthermore β sheet rich proteins present on the cell surface forming the glue in between the cells and the matrix may be s layer proteins and or adhesins to elucidate the extracellular matrix of anammox granules the individual components need to be analysed in more detail for example the glycoprotein for ca brocadia sapporoensis boleij et al 2018 and for ca brocadia sinica wong et al 2019 were already characterized in more detail 5 conclusions global proteomics studies have shed huge insight into many biological processes however their application to assigning major structural extracellular proteins is limited by extraction techniques protein solubility and digestibility and poor representation of extracellular proteins in the reference databases we addressed the issue of extraction and solubility and observed that while using different extraction methods increases the number of proteins detected nonetheless the main ones were largely common we observed by microscopy that the matrix is dominated by β sheet structures and confirmed that the extracted proteins had predominately β sheet structures hence we believe that we extracted structural proteins however we could not assign any of the proteins identified from the different extracts by ms as being dominant structural proteins due to the high number of uncharacterized proteins potential for moonlighting functions among proteins and the lack of biophysical data regarding the structures of many of these proteins nonetheless the extraction methods described here enable the biochemical e g isolation and biophysical approaches needed to fill in the blanks in the protein

18567,the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of natural organic matter nom including humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa intracellular organic matter iom extracted from microcystis aeruginosa ma and chlorella sp ch and their different molecular weight mw fractions on the aerobic denitrification performance of bacterial strain wgx 9 by monitoring nitrogen removal efficiency and testing changes in organic matter with ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source strain wgx 9 was identified as acinetobacter johnsonii and exhibited excellent aerobic denitrification capability the nitrate removal efficiency with iom as the sole carbon source was relatively higher than that with nom as the sole carbon source the prepared nom and extracted iom samples were separated into six fractions with mw cut offs of 100 30 10 5 and 1 kda the fraction of mw 100 kda contributed the largest amount to the mw distribution accounting for 77 11 29 00 44 97 and 24 81 of ha fa ma iom and ch iom respectively nitrate removal efficiency was improved with decreasing mw of organic matter for example nitrate removal efficiency was 26 50 32 41 27 88 and 43 89 using ha fa ma iom and ch iom fractions of mw 100 kda as the carbon source whereas with mw 1 kda it increased to 36 67 37 88 60 90 and 68 90 respectively this is probably because the smaller mw fraction is more suitable for bacterial growth these results demonstrate that the strain wgx 9 can utilize lower mw organic matter which lays the foundations for nitrogen removal in actual drinking water reservoirs graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic denitrifier nitrogen removal natural organic matter algogenic organic matter molecular weight 1 introduction nitrogen pollution mainly nitrate in surface water has become an increasingly serious issue worldwide especially in drinking water reservoirs huang et al 2014 2015a fenech et al 2012 excessive nitrogen levels can cause water eutrophication resulting in deterioration of water quality by increasing turbidity affecting taste and odor and increasing organic matter content due to algal blooms hua et al 2019 furthermore it affects the development of aquatic organisms threatens human health and increases the cost of water treatment camargo and alonso 2006 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 biological treatment is an efficient and economical method to remove nitrate marchant et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a huang et al 2015a there are two types of denitrification processes anaerobic denitrification and aerobic denitrification hiscock et al 1991 conventional theory suggests that denitrification is an anaerobic process where denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate to n2o or n2 in rather low dissolved oxygen aquatic environments marchant et al 2017 in the 1980s an aerobic denitrifier thiosphaera pantotropha was discovered by robertson and kuenen in a sulfide oxidizing wastewater treatment plant which was not limited to oxygen robertson and kuenen 1983 in the following years plenty of aerobic denitrifiers were isolated and reported including pseudomonas stutzeri strain zf31 huang et al 2015a hanseniaspora uvarum strain kpl108 zhang et al 2018a janthinobacterium sp m 11 yang et al 2018 and acinetobacter harbinensis hitli7t zheng et al 2018 aerobic denitrifying bacteria can simultaneously remove nitrogen and carbon the carbon source acts as an electron donor and oxygen and nitrate act as electron acceptors during the denitrification process zhang et al 2018a huang et al 2015b compared with traditional anaerobic denitrification aerobic denitrification shows many advantages for instance the denitrification process is not limited by oxygen the denitrification efficiency is obvious huang et al 2015c and the process is more economic huang et al 2015a therefore aerobic denitrification process has been widely studied in recent years recently many studies have been focused on isolating new aerobic denitrifiers zhou et al 2016 zhu et al 2012 and exploring the influencing factors including type of carbon source c n ratio ph dissolved oxygen temperature and shaking speed zhang et al 2018a huang et al 2015a zhao et al 2017 as well as clarifying the mechanism of aerobic denitrification zhang et al 2018a however most of these studies have focused on wastewater treatment zhang et al 2018b in micro polluted reservoirs aerobic denitrification efficiency was obviously poor owing to a lower carbon nitrate and temperature worrich et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 moreover a previous study demonstrated that the carbon source is one of the most important limited factors affecting aerobic denitrification and that different carbon sources have varying effects hiscock et al 1991 marchant et al 2017 for example when sodium acetate sucrose tryptone and starch was spiked as the carbon source individually the nitrate removal performance followed the order sodium acetate sucrose tryptone starch sodium acetate improves the denitrification performance of aerobic denitrifiers which may be due to its simple and small molecular structure huang et al 2014 unfortunately previous studies have mainly focused on man made carbon sources including sodium acetate sodium succinate glucose sodium citrate and so on yang et al 2018 huang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a which are obviously different from those in drinking water reservoirs therefore it is necessary to determine the effect of carbon sources derived from actual water reservoirs on nitrogen removal by aerobic denitrifiers natural organic matter nom is ubiquitous in natural water reservoirs lee et al 2018 based on previous study nom is divided into humic substances proteins carbohydrates lignins phenolic and aliphatic compounds humic substances are made up of humic acids ha fulvic acids fa and humin marchant et al 2017 during algal blooming in drinking water reservoirs algae would release the algogenic organic matter aom that is usually classified into extra eom and intra cellular organic matter iom also yield high concentrations of total organic carbon which are different from the humic dominated nom hua et al 2019 park et al 2019 aom comprises of various substances such as amino acids polysaccharides and other small molecular acids and previous study demonstrated that iom contributes a significant fraction to total aom 80 hua et al 2019 owing to the different components of nom and iom the assimilable organic matter aoc is different lou et al 2014 till date the effect of nom and iom as carbon sources on aerobic denitrification has not been reported therefore it is necessary to compare the effect of major organic matter derived from actual water bodies on aerobic denitrification besides nom and iom are complex and heterogeneous mixtures that vary in size structure and functionality especially in molecular weight mw in previous study mw was found to be an important feature in aerobic denitrification and the aoc differs in different mw fractions hua et al 2019 liu et al 2018 guo et al 2017 however the effect of different mw fractions of nom and iom on aerobic denitrification is currently unknown therefore there is an immediate need to explain the relationship between different mw fractions as a carbon source and the denitrification performance of aerobic denitrifiers in this study the aerobic denitrification performance of strain wgx 9 was studied using nom and iom as the carbon source in particular the effect of different mw organic matter fractions the specific objectives were 1 to identify strain wgx 9 using 16s rrna and the specific gene napa and to examine the aerobic denitrification performance 2 to investigate the effect of nom and iom as the carbon source on aerobic denitrification performance and the changes in organic matter 3 to fractionate the nom and iom into six fractions and to measure their characteristics and clarify the impact of different mw fractions of nom and iom on aerobic denitrification performance 4 to explore the mechanism by monitoring the variation in organic matter based on estimated total organic carbon toc excitation emission matrix spectra eem uv254 and specific uv absorbance suva this was the first report to investigate the effect of nom and iom on aerobic denitrification especially the relationship between different mw fractions as carbon source and denitrification performance results might be useful for predicting the denitrification effect of aerobic denitrifying bacteria in drinking water reservoir and whether aerobic denitrifying bacteria can be applied 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture media and identification of strain wgx 9 strain wgx 9 was isolated from the sediment of a drinking water reservoir in xi an shaanxi province china 33 42 n 107 43 e and showed effective and stable denitrification under aerobic conditions and was therefore selected for this study strain wgx 9 was stored at 80 c with 50 glycerol to identify strain wgx 9 the genomic dna was extracted using a dna extraction kit omega bio tek usa the purified dna was used to amplify the 16s rrna gene by a polymerase chain reaction pcr using bacterial universal primers table s1 the amplified 16s rrna gene sequence was submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database and compared with other bacterial sequence data using basic local alignment search tool blast to determine whether the genome of strain wgx 9 contained nitrate reductase gene the presence of napa was confirmed the primers and amplified conditions are shown in table s1 before use strain wgx 9 was repeatedly inoculated in denitrification medium dm to eliminate the effects of glycerol the content of dm was referenced as reported previously zhu et al 2012 all dm and flasks were sterilized at 121 c for 30 min and all chemical reagents were supplied by tianjin kermel chemical reagents china 2 2 determination of carbon and nitrogen removal capacity to explore the denitrification characteristics nitrogen removal efficiency and toc change were measured to assess cell growth performance bacterial concentration was determined for culture testing the strain suspension was cultured in dm the bacterial suspension 7 5 ml was inoculated into 150 ml of liquid dm in 250 ml flasks which were sealed with sterile breathable sealing membranes and incubated at 30 c with a shaking speed of 130 rpm the medium without inoculation was used as a control during the cultivation period samples were periodically taken to determine toc nitrate nitrite ammonium tn concentration and bacterial concentration all assays were performed in triplicate 2 3 algal cultivation and iom extraction two types of algae microcystis aeruginosa ma and chlorella sp ch commonly found in water source reservoirs were selected the algae were cultured in modified bg 11 medium algal cultivation was carried out at room temperature 25 1 c

phase algal suspensions were selected algal suspensions were centrifuged at 9600 r min for 30 min at 4 c to separate the algal cells the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm mixed cellular membrane filter and the filtrate was referred as eom the remaining algal cells were then washed three times with 0 8 nacl to remove the remaining eom wen et al 2017 qu et al 2012 the algal cells were subjected to three freeze thaw cycles i e 80 c freezer 37 c water bath for 40 min and 10 min respectively the supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 9600 r min for 20 min at 4 c the filtrate was then passed through a 0 22 μm mixed cellular membrane and was referred as iom gao et al 2015 2 4 molecular weight fractionation the ha fa ma iom and ch iom were separated into different mw fractions using ultrafiltration devices millipore usa with mw cut offs of 100 30 10 5 and 1 kda the ultrafiltration device is shown in fig s1 in serial processing 0 1 mpa of pressure was provided by high purity nitrogen the sample was passed through the mw cut offs of 100 30 10 5 and 1 kda successively and the fractionation process is shown in fig s2 after serial fractionation the nom and iom samples were separated into six fractions with a mw range of 100 kda 30 100 kda 10 30 kda 5 10 kda 1 5 kda and 1 kda the toc concentration of each fraction was then measured and the corresponding dm with different mw fractions was prepared according to the toc content 2 5 aerobic denitrification performance by different mw fraction according to the toc content the aerobic denitrification medium with six different mw fractions of ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the carbon source were obtained for culture experiments the bacterial suspension 7 5 ml was inoculated into 150 ml liquid dm in 250 ml flasks sealed and incubated at 30 c with a shaking speed of 130 rpm the medium without inoculation was used as a control during the incubation process samples were periodically taken for the measurement of nitrate tn and tdn concentrations to characterize the denitrification performance of strain wgx 9 bacterial density was measured to represent the growth performance of strain wgx 9 toc eem uv254 and suva reflect the change in organic properties three biological replicates were used n 3 2 6 characterization of organic matter the toc uv254 suva and eem were used to characterize the organic properties all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm mixed cellular membrane prior to measurement before eem scanning the samples were adjusted to a toc of 5 mg l and ph 7 0 for contrast eem

with tukey s hsd test p 0 05 using spss version 25 0 ibm corporation armonk ny usa pearson s correlation was used to test whether there was a statistically significant linear relationship between cell growth and nitrate concentration toc content and nitrate concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of strain wgx 9 strain wgx 9 was identified based on the 16s rrna gene sequence and nucleotide sequence comparison through ncbi showed that strain wgx 9 had a high similarity 99 with the acinetobacter johnsonii strain zzx01 therefore strain wgx 9 was identified as acinetobacter johnsonii wgx 9 the napa gene fragment encoding nitrate reductase under aerobic conditions was amplified from strain wgx 9 which demonstrated its potential capacity for nitrate removal under aerobic conditions fig s3 the nitrogen balance was measured to characterize denitrification table s8 and the concentration of dissolve oxygen do was between 7 and 8 mg l during the culture process these results indicated that the strain wgx 9 can remove effectively nitrate at an aerobic condition 2 mg l and which further indicated that the strain wgx 9 was aerobic denitrification bacterium fig 1 shows the denitrification performance of strain wgx 9 under aerobic conditions do 7 82 mg l using sodium acetate as the carbon source after 12 h cultivation the growth of strain wgx 9 entered a stationary phase with a total cell count of 1 23 108 cells ml fig 1a the concentration of nitrate decreased from 3 31 mg l to 0 43 mg l fig 1b and the removal efficiency of nitrate tn and toc reached 86 56 40 60 and 90 25 respectively the maximum nitrate removal rate of strain wgx 9 reached 0 203 mg l h which was higher than that of strain janthinobacterium sp m 11 yang et al 2018 with a removal rate of 0 055 mg l h and acinetobacter harbinensis hitli7 t zheng et al 2018 with a removal rate of 0 029 mg l h in an oligotrophic condition during the aerobic denitrification process there was no formation of ammonium and no obvious accumulation of nitrite fig 1b the results of nitrogen balance analysis are shown in table s8 at the end of the process a comparison of the initial and final tn concentration in the medium showed that 19 93 of the no3 n was converted to intracellular nitrogen 26 28 was converted to nitrification products no2 n nh4 n and organic nitrogen and approximately 40 18 of the initial nitrogen was lost probably removed in the form of gas products these results indicate that strain wgx 9 is an aerobic denitrifier with a good aerobic denitrification performance 3 2 aerobic denitrification performance of strain wgx 9 with nom and iom as the carbon source with nom or iom as the sole carbon source the nitrate removal efficiency toc removal efficiency and maximum nitrate removal rate is shown in fig 2 the nitrogen and toc change during aerobic denitrification by strain wgx 9 is shown in fig s4 upon reaching the stationary phase the nitrate removal efficiency attained 16 50 19 04 25 20 and 30 98 and the maximum nitrate removal rate was 0 034 mg l h 0 036 mg l h 0 075 mg l h and 0 066 mg l h with ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source respectively with sodium acetate as the sole carbon source fig 1 the maximum nitrate removal efficiency and rate was 85 56 and 0 203 mg l h respectively and nom and iom showed relatively lower removal efficiency the bioavailability of sodium acetate was significantly higher than that of nom and iom and facilitated bacterial growth which may be used to explain the higher nitrate removal efficiency huang et al 2014 lee et al 2018 wen et al 2017 as shown in table 1 the maximum total cell concentration for ha fa ma iom and ch iom was 0 50 107 1 05 107 6 23 107 and 8 22 107 cells ml respectively which was lower than that of sodium acetate as the carbon source 1 23 108 cells ml the nitrate removal efficiency and rate with iom ma iom ch iom as the sole carbon source were relatively higher than those with nom ha fa as the sole carbon source which was probably attributed to their lower molecular weight as shown in section 3 3 and complex compositions egli 2010 zhang et al 2018b the comparisons of organic matter changes with ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source during aerobic denitrification were recorded using toc uv254 suva and eem as shown in fig 2 the toc change followed the same trend as that of nitrate with a greater toc removal efficiency than that of iom ma iom ch iom as the sole carbon source uv254 and suva representing the aromatic substances and difficult to be utilized by microorganisms lee et al 2018 are shown in table 2 during aerobic denitrification uv254 decreased gradually the results showed a lower aromatic content of ma iom and ch iom relative to ha and fa indicating that ma iom and ch iom were more easily utilized by strain wgx 9 than were ha and fa therefore the higher uv254 and suva of organic matter was an indicator of the lower nitrate removal efficiency and bacterial growth the eem spectra changes of ha fa ma iom and ch iom during aerobic denitrification by strain wgx 9 are shown in table s2 the ha peaks were mainly concentrated on polycarboxylate polyaromatic type humic acid ex em of 275 440 nm and 370 458 nm the fa peaks included fulvic acid like compounds ex em of 240 445 nm and humic acid like compounds ex em of 355 435 nm for ma iom the tryptophan like tyrosine like and humic fulvic acid like fluorescence was detected at an ex em of 275 334 nm 230 334 nm 280 452 nm and 370 452 nm the ch iom peaks involved tyrosine tryptophan protein at an ex em of 275 344 nm 230 344 nm the results of ma iom and ch iom manifested the same outcome as that reported previously henderson et al 2008 hua et al 2018 2019 after 96 h of cultivation the fluorescence intensity weakened and the iom ma iom ch iom decreased greatly relative to nom ha fa the changes indicated that biological degradation prioritizes the use of tyrosine tryptophan protein components in agreement with the results obtained in previous studies lee et al 2018 hur and kim 2009 hur et al 2011 based on this conclusion the removal efficiency of iom was found to be better than that of nom 3 3 characterizations of different mw fractions as shown in fig 3 the mw distribution of ha fa ma iom and ch iom was described by each fraction in toc the ha had the major distribution in a large mw portion 100 kda with a percentage of 77 11 with the smaller mw fractions 5 10 1 5 and 1 kda forming a total of 5 16 along with the remnant fractions of 30 100 kda and 10 30 kda at about 8 72 and 9 01 respectively fig 3a the result suggested that ha is generally composed of substances with a large mw whereas fa showed a different distribution six fractions in fa followed the order 100 kda 10 30 kda 30 100 kda 5 10 kda 1 5 kda 1 kda and accounted for 29 00 18 44 15 55 and 4 10 respectively fig 3a the result manifested that the mw distribution of fa was more uniform than that of ha with respect to ma iom the proportion of the 100 kda fraction was 44 97 the ratio of the 30 100 10 30 and 5 10 kda fractions was about 15 on average and the remaining small molecule 1 5 kda and 1 kda fractions accounted for 7 99 and 4 85 respectively fig 3b this result indicates that the fractions of mw 100 kda played a significant role in ma iom and further confirmed the results of a previous work hua et al 2019 guo et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 as for ch iom the mw distribution was more homogeneous in each mw fraction from 100 kda to 1 kda the proportion of different mw fractions was 24 81 16 86 19 78 15 55 13 98 and 8 87 respectively fig 3b which was slightly discrepant from the results of previous research hua et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 probably because of the difference in algal density and extraction methods the distribution of each mw fraction in uv254 showed a distribution similar to that of toc table s3 ha is generally composed of substances with mw 100 kda 70 70 the distribution of fa is mainly concentrated in 100 kda 29 84 and 10 30 kda 30 86 as for ma iom and ch iom the proportion of the mw 100 kda fraction was 46 56 and 23 97 respectively these results showed that iom showed lower mw distribution when compared with nom which may explain why the nitrate removal performance of iom is better than that of nom as shown in section 3 2 the eem spectrum of different mw fractions of ha fa ma iom and ch iom are shown in tables s4 s5 s6 and s7 with the initial 0 h with regard to ha different mw fractions were mainly composed of polyaromatic type humic acid similar to the original ha with the mw 100 kda fraction accounting for the highest fluorescence intensity 1761 a u for the fa in addition to the peaks of humic fulvic acid like the fluorescence peak representing tryptophan ex em of 275 334 nm and tyrosine proteins ex em of 230 334 nm appeared in 1 5 kda and 1 kda fraction the spectrum of ma iom varied greatly at different mw fractions the mw 100 kda mainly consisted of tyrosine tryptophan protein whereas both the tyrosine tryptophan protein and humic fulvic acid like emerged in other different mw fractions as for ch iom all the different mw fractions consisted of tyrosine tryptophan protein these results of ma iom and ch iom are in accordance with those reported in a previous study hua et al 2019 li et al 2012 the iom showed a complex composition including tyrosine tryptophan protein and humic fulvic acid like whereas nom showed only humic fulvic acid like which can explain why iom can show better improvement in the nitrate removal efficiency of strain wgx 9 3 4 nitrogen removal performance with different mw fractions as carbon source with different mw fractions of ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source nitrogen and toc removal by strain wgx 9 during the aerobic denitrification process is shown in fig s5 fig s6 fig s7 and fig s8 the nitrate removal efficiency and maximum nitrate removal rate with different mw fractions as the carbon source are shown in fig 4 an increase in nitrate removal efficiency and removal rate was observed for strain wgx 9 with decreasing mw for example the nitrate removal efficiency was 26 50 32 41 27 88 and 43 89 with mw 100 kda fraction as the carbon source whereas for mw 1 kda fraction it increased to 36 67 37 88 60 90 and 68 90 for ha fa ma iom and ch iom respectively according to the proportion and removal efficiency of each different mw fraction the average nitrate removal efficiency could be calculated as 28 05 26 76 44 10 and 56 20 with ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source respectively the calculated nitrate removal efficiency was slightly higher than that of the experimental results section 3 2 at 16 50 19 04 25 20 and 30 98 respectively the reasons for this result were attributed to the fractionally different mw organic matter which may provide more aoc for bacterial growth and more electron donors for the reduction of nitrate compared with the original organic matter hua et al 2019 furthermore the maximum nitrate removal rate showed a similar trend and reached 0 079 mg l h 0 084 mg l h 0 260 mg l h and 0 315 mg l h with the mw 1 kda fraction as the carbon source which was significantly higher than that of mw 100 kda with a removal rate of 0 059 mg l h 0 062 mg l h 0 104 mg l h and 0 083 mg l h for ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the carbon source respectively these results indicated that the smaller the mw of organic matter the better is the denitrification performance during the aerobic denitrification process with ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the carbon source at the same molecular weight such as mw 100 30 100 10 30 5 10 1 5 and 1 kda the nitrate removal efficiency and maximal nitrate removal rate with iom ma iom ch iom as the sole carbon source were relatively higher than that of with nom ha fa as the sole carbon source fig 4 fa and ch iom induced the nitrate removal efficiency higher compared with that of ha and ma iom similar to the ungraded nom and iom section 3 2 which may also be attributed to their lower molecular weight as shown in section 3 3 and complex compositions egli 2010 zhang et al 2018a 3 5 reasons for varying nitrate removal efficiency with different mw fractions as the carbon source 3 5 1 bacterial change with different mw fractions of ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source the tcc changes of strain wgx 9 are shown in table 3 the cell proliferation for the mw 100 kda is significantly less than the mw 1 kda for example the maximum cell density was 0 95 107 4 42 107 1 76 108 and 0 77 108 cells ml with the mw 100 kda fraction as the carbon source whereas for mw 1 kda it increased to 2 89 107 5 98 107 6 12 108 and 6 88 108 cells ml for ha fa ma iom and ch iom respectively the result indicated that the decrease in mw was beneficial to the growth of strain wgx 9 previous study showed that cell density is one of the significant factors affecting nitrate removal efficiency during aerobic denitrification zhang et al 2018b and analyzed the relationship between the tcc and nitrate concentrations there was a strong negative correlation in the periods of cultivation pearson s correlation r ha 0 962 p 0 001 n 8 r fa 0 973 p 0 001 n 8 r ma iom 0 968 p 0 001 n 8 r ch iom 0 988 p 0 001 n 8 this result was similar to that with pseudomonas stutzeri strain xl 2 zhao et al 2017 and paracoccus versutus ks293 zhang et al 2018a showing that nitrate removal efficiency was directly related to bacterial growth therefore the mw 1 kda fraction was found to be suitable for bacterial growth and was further beneficial to nitrate removal 3 5 2 toc change as shown in fig 5 the carbon removal efficiency of strain wgx 9 was described with different mw fractions of ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source toc removal efficiency increased from 13 80 32 41 44 12 and 42 33 34 80 52 67 70 90 and 70 89 respectively with the decrease in the fraction mw from 100 kda to 1 kda it could be inferred that strain wgx 9 performed toc removal effectively in the mw 1 kda and used the smaller mw organic matter efficiently which was the similar to the result obtained with janthinobacterium sp m 11 yang et al 2018 there was a significant positive correlation between nitrate concentrations and toc content in the cultivation period pearson s correlation r ha 0 913 p 0 001 n 8 r fa 0 945 p 0 001 n 8 r ma iom 0 981 p 0 001 n 8 r ch iom 0 965 p 0 001 n 8 this result suggested that the reduction in toc content would promote a significant decrease in nitrate concentration therefore in the smaller mw fraction more organic matter was utilized by strain wgx 9 resulting in higher toc removal and an increase in nitrate removal 3 5 3 uv254 and suva change fig 6 shows the uv254 changes in different mw fractions produced by strain wgx 9 using ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source table 4 shows suva changes in different mw fractions treated with strain wgx 9 during aerobic denitrification this shows that the uv254 and suva is lower in lower mw fractions for ha fa ma iom and ch iom this distinct tendency indicated that the uv254 removal efficiency was enhanced gradually with the decreasing mw of fractions with regard to ha fa ma iom and ch iom the uv254 removal efficiency increased from 8 32 9 40 50 00 and 47 80 31 40 40 60 64 31 and 63 62 respectively as the mw fraction decreased from 100 kda to 1 kda fig s9 generally uv254 represents a substance of macromolecules and suva reflects the aromaticity of organic matter previous studies showed that macromolecular and aromatic organic matter were hardly used by microorganisms kolehmainen et al 2007 henderson et al 2008 lee et al 2018 therefore the lower uv254 and suva may be one of the reasons for better nitrate removal efficiency in the fraction of mw 1 kda 3 5 4 fluorescence change during aerobic denitrification the fluorescence spectra of different mw fractions was changed after cultivation of strain wgx 9 for 96 h tables s4 s5 s6 s7 the change in fluorescence spectra before and after denitrification in the fraction of mw 100 kda and 1 kda is shown in fig 7 and fig 8 the fluorescence intensity of different mw fractions with respect to ha fa ma iom and ch iom was decreased after 96 h cultivation tables s4 s5 s6 s7 and the fraction of mw 1 kda manifested a greater decrease in fluorescence intensity when compared with that of mw 100 kda figs 7 and 8 in mw 1 kda the eem fluorescence spectra display more complex compositions and previous studies showed that a mixed carbon source can promote the growth of microorganisms egli 2010 and that biodegradation processes preferentially removed tyrosine tryptophan like or protein like components lee et al 2018 hur et al 2011 which may be another important reason for higher nitrate removal in smaller mw fractions 4 conclusions based on the experimental results of this study four main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 a nitrate removal efficiency of 86 56 and a nitrate removal rate of 0 203 mg l h were reached with sodium acetate as the carbon source with the strain wgx 9 under aerobic conditions and strain wgx 9 was identified as acinetobacter johnsonii and the napa gene was amplified 2 lower nitrate removal efficiency by strain wgx 9 was observed using nom and iom as the sole carbon source when compared with that using sodium acetate and the nitrate removal efficiency and rate with iom as the sole carbon source was relatively higher than that with nom as the sole carbon source which may be due to the lower molecular weight and complex composition of iom 3 the fraction of mw 100 kda is the maximal portion of ha fa ma iom and ch iom with organic matter which accounts for 77 11 29 00 44 97 and 24 81 respectively according to the toc concentration furthermore according to the uv254 the proportion of mw 100 kda accounted for 70 70 29 84 46 56 and 23 97 4 these results illustrate that nitrate removal efficiency was improved with the decreasing mw of organic matter with the mw 1 kda the nitrate removal efficiency was increased to 36 67 37 88 60 90 and 68 90 using ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the carbon source respectively which may be because lower mw shows better bacterial growth and carbon source utilization ability and shows lower uv254 and suva to promote nitrate removal acknowledgements this work was supported by the natural science foundation of china no 51678472 shaanxi science fund for distinguished young scholars no

18567,the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of natural organic matter nom including humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa intracellular organic matter iom extracted from microcystis aeruginosa ma and chlorella sp ch and their different molecular weight mw fractions on the aerobic denitrification performance of bacterial strain wgx 9 by monitoring nitrogen removal efficiency and testing changes in organic matter with ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source strain wgx 9 was identified as acinetobacter johnsonii and exhibited excellent aerobic denitrification capability the nitrate removal efficiency with iom as the sole carbon source was relatively higher than that with nom as the sole carbon source the prepared nom and extracted iom samples were separated into six fractions with mw cut offs of 100 30 10 5 and 1 kda the fraction of mw 100 kda contributed the largest amount to the mw distribution accounting for 77 11 29 00 44 97 and 24 81 of ha fa ma iom and ch iom respectively nitrate removal efficiency was improved with decreasing mw of organic matter for example nitrate removal efficiency was 26 50 32 41 27 88 and 43 89 using ha fa ma iom and ch iom fractions of mw 100 kda as the carbon source whereas with mw 1 kda it increased to 36 67 37 88 60 90 and 68 90 respectively this is probably because the smaller mw fraction is more suitable for bacterial growth these results demonstrate that the strain wgx 9 can utilize lower mw organic matter which lays the foundations for nitrogen removal in actual drinking water reservoirs graphical

become an increasingly serious issue worldwide especially in drinking water reservoirs huang et al 2014 2015a fenech et al 2012 excessive nitrogen levels can cause water eutrophication resulting in deterioration of water quality by increasing turbidity affecting taste and odor and increasing organic matter content due to algal blooms hua et al 2019 furthermore it affects the development of aquatic organisms threatens human health and increases the cost of water treatment camargo and alonso 2006 wang et al 2018 wang et al 2019 biological treatment is an efficient and economical method to remove nitrate marchant et al 2017 zhang et al 2018a huang et al 2015a there are two types of denitrification processes anaerobic denitrification and aerobic denitrification hiscock et al 1991 conventional theory suggests that denitrification is an anaerobic process where denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate to n2o or n2 in rather low dissolved oxygen aquatic environments marchant et al 2017 in the 1980s an aerobic denitrifier thiosphaera pantotropha was discovered by robertson and kuenen in a sulfide oxidizing wastewater treatment plant which was not limited to oxygen robertson and kuenen 1983 in the following years plenty of aerobic denitrifiers were isolated and reported including pseudomonas stutzeri strain zf31 huang et al 2015a hanseniaspora uvarum strain kpl108 zhang et al 2018a janthinobacterium sp m 11 yang et al 2018 and acinetobacter harbinensis hitli7t zheng et al 2018 aerobic denitrifying bacteria can simultaneously remove nitrogen and carbon the carbon source acts as an electron donor and oxygen and nitrate act as electron acceptors during the denitrification process zhang et al 2018a huang et al 2015b compared with traditional anaerobic denitrification aerobic denitrification shows many advantages for instance the denitrification process is not limited by oxygen the denitrification efficiency is obvious huang et al 2015c and the process is more economic huang et al 2015a therefore aerobic denitrification process has been widely studied in recent years recently many studies have been focused on isolating new aerobic denitrifiers zhou et al 2016 zhu et al 2012 and exploring the influencing factors including type of carbon source c n ratio ph dissolved oxygen temperature and shaking speed zhang et al 2018a huang et al 2015a zhao et al 2017 as well as clarifying the mechanism of aerobic denitrification zhang et al 2018a however most of these studies have focused on wastewater treatment zhang et al 2018b in micro polluted reservoirs aerobic denitrification efficiency was obviously poor owing to a lower carbon nitrate and temperature worrich et al 2017 zhou et al 2016 moreover a previous study demonstrated that the carbon source is one of the most important limited factors affecting aerobic denitrification and that different carbon sources have varying effects hiscock et al 1991 marchant et al 2017 for example when sodium acetate sucrose tryptone and starch was spiked as the carbon source individually the nitrate removal performance followed the order sodium acetate sucrose tryptone starch sodium acetate improves the denitrification performance of aerobic denitrifiers which may be due to its simple and small molecular structure huang et al 2014 unfortunately previous studies have mainly focused on man made carbon sources including sodium acetate sodium succinate glucose sodium citrate and so on yang et al 2018 huang et al 2014 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018a which are obviously different from those in drinking water reservoirs therefore it is necessary to determine the effect of carbon sources derived from actual water reservoirs on nitrogen removal by aerobic denitrifiers natural organic matter nom is ubiquitous in natural water reservoirs lee et al 2018 based on previous study nom is divided into humic substances proteins carbohydrates lignins phenolic and aliphatic compounds humic substances are made up of humic acids ha fulvic acids fa and humin marchant et al 2017 during algal blooming in drinking water reservoirs algae would release the algogenic organic matter aom that is usually classified into extra eom and intra cellular organic matter iom also yield high concentrations of total organic carbon which are different from the humic dominated nom hua et al 2019 park et al 2019 aom comprises of various substances such as amino acids polysaccharides and other small molecular acids and previous study demonstrated that iom contributes a significant fraction to total aom 80 hua et al 2019 owing to the different components of nom and iom the assimilable organic matter aoc is different lou et al 2014 till date the effect of nom and iom as carbon sources on aerobic denitrification has not been reported therefore it is necessary to compare the effect of major organic matter derived from actual water bodies on aerobic denitrification besides nom and iom are complex and heterogeneous mixtures that vary in size structure and functionality especially in molecular weight mw in previous study mw was found to be an important feature in aerobic denitrification and the aoc differs in different mw fractions hua et al 2019 liu et al 2018 guo et al 2017 however the effect of different mw fractions of nom and iom on aerobic denitrification is currently unknown therefore there is an immediate need to explain the relationship between different mw fractions as a carbon source and the denitrification performance of aerobic denitrifiers in this study the aerobic denitrification performance of strain wgx 9 was studied using nom and iom as the carbon source in particular the effect of different mw organic matter fractions the specific objectives were 1 to identify strain wgx 9 using 16s rrna and the specific gene napa and to examine the aerobic denitrification performance 2 to investigate the effect of nom and iom as the carbon source on aerobic denitrification performance and the changes in organic matter 3 to fractionate the nom and iom into six fractions and to measure their characteristics and clarify the impact of different mw fractions of nom and iom on aerobic denitrification performance 4 to explore the mechanism by monitoring the variation in organic matter based on estimated total organic carbon toc excitation emission matrix spectra eem uv254 and specific uv absorbance suva this was the first report to investigate the effect of nom and iom on aerobic denitrification especially the relationship between different mw fractions as carbon source and denitrification performance results might be useful for predicting the denitrification effect of aerobic denitrifying bacteria in drinking water reservoir and whether aerobic denitrifying bacteria can be applied 2 materials and methods 2 1 culture media and identification of strain wgx 9 strain wgx 9 was isolated from the sediment of a drinking water reservoir in xi an shaanxi province china 33 42 n 107 43 e and showed effective and stable denitrification under aerobic conditions and was therefore selected for this study strain wgx 9 was stored at 80 c with 50 glycerol to identify strain wgx 9 the genomic dna was extracted using a dna extraction kit omega bio tek usa the purified dna was used to amplify the 16s rrna gene by a polymerase chain reaction pcr using bacterial universal primers table s1 the amplified 16s rrna gene sequence was submitted to the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database and compared with other bacterial sequence data using basic local alignment search tool blast to determine whether the genome of strain wgx 9 contained nitrate reductase gene the presence of napa was confirmed the primers and amplified conditions are shown in table s1 before use strain wgx 9 was repeatedly inoculated in denitrification medium dm to eliminate the effects of glycerol the content of dm was referenced as reported previously zhu et al 2012 all dm and flasks were sterilized at 121 c for 30 min and all chemical reagents were supplied by tianjin kermel chemical reagents china 2 2 determination of carbon and nitrogen removal capacity to explore the denitrification characteristics nitrogen removal efficiency and toc change were measured to assess cell growth performance bacterial concentration was determined for culture testing the strain suspension was cultured in dm the bacterial suspension 7 5 ml was inoculated into 150 ml of liquid dm in 250 ml flasks which were sealed with sterile breathable sealing membranes and incubated at 30 c with a shaking speed of 130 rpm the medium without inoculation was used as a control during the cultivation period samples were periodically taken to determine toc nitrate nitrite ammonium tn concentration and bacterial concentration all assays were performed in triplicate 2 3 algal cultivation and iom extraction two types of algae microcystis aeruginosa ma and chlorella sp ch commonly found in water source reservoirs were selected the algae were cultured in modified bg 11 medium algal cultivation was carried out at room temperature 25 1 c

phase algal suspensions were selected algal suspensions were centrifuged at 9600 r min for 30 min at 4 c to separate the algal cells the supernatant was filtered through a 0 22 μm mixed cellular membrane filter and the filtrate was referred as eom the remaining algal cells were then washed three times with 0 8 nacl to remove the remaining eom wen et al 2017 qu et al 2012 the algal cells were subjected to three freeze thaw cycles i e 80 c freezer 37 c water bath for 40 min and 10 min respectively the supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 9600 r min for 20 min at 4 c the filtrate was then passed through a 0 22 μm mixed cellular membrane and was referred as iom gao et al 2015 2 4 molecular weight fractionation the ha fa ma iom and ch iom were separated into different mw fractions using ultrafiltration devices millipore usa with mw cut offs of 100 30 10 5 and 1 kda the ultrafiltration device is shown in fig s1 in serial processing 0 1 mpa of pressure was provided by high purity nitrogen the sample was passed through the mw cut offs of 100 30 10 5 and 1 kda successively and the fractionation process is shown in fig s2 after serial fractionation the nom and iom samples were separated into six fractions with a mw range of 100 kda 30 100 kda 10 30 kda 5 10 kda 1 5 kda and 1 kda the toc concentration of each fraction was then measured and the corresponding dm with different mw fractions was prepared according to the toc content 2 5 aerobic denitrification performance by different mw fraction according to the toc content the aerobic denitrification medium with six different mw fractions of ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the carbon source were obtained for culture experiments the bacterial suspension 7 5 ml was inoculated into 150 ml liquid dm in 250 ml flasks sealed and incubated at 30 c with a shaking speed of 130 rpm the medium without inoculation was used as a control during the incubation process samples were periodically taken for the measurement of nitrate tn and tdn concentrations to characterize the denitrification performance of strain wgx 9 bacterial density was measured to represent the growth performance of strain wgx 9 toc eem uv254 and suva reflect the change in organic properties three biological replicates were used n 3 2 6 characterization of organic matter the toc uv254 suva and eem were used to characterize the organic properties all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm mixed cellular membrane prior to measurement before eem scanning the samples were adjusted to a toc of 5 mg l and ph 7 0 for contrast eem

with tukey s hsd test p 0 05 using spss version 25 0 ibm corporation armonk ny usa pearson s correlation was used to test whether there was a statistically significant linear relationship between cell growth and nitrate concentration toc content and nitrate concentration 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of strain wgx 9 strain wgx 9 was identified based on the 16s rrna gene sequence and nucleotide sequence comparison through ncbi showed that strain wgx 9 had a high similarity 99 with the acinetobacter johnsonii strain zzx01 therefore strain wgx 9 was identified as acinetobacter johnsonii wgx 9 the napa gene fragment encoding nitrate reductase under aerobic conditions was amplified from strain wgx 9 which demonstrated its potential capacity for nitrate removal under aerobic conditions fig s3 the nitrogen balance was measured to characterize denitrification table s8 and the concentration of dissolve oxygen do was between 7 and 8 mg l during the culture process these results indicated that the strain wgx 9 can remove effectively nitrate at an aerobic condition 2 mg l and which further indicated that the strain wgx 9 was aerobic denitrification bacterium fig 1 shows the denitrification performance of strain wgx 9 under aerobic conditions do 7 82 mg l using sodium acetate as the carbon source after 12 h cultivation the growth of strain wgx 9 entered a stationary phase with a total cell count of 1 23 108 cells ml fig 1a the concentration of nitrate decreased from 3 31 mg l to 0 43 mg l fig 1b and the removal efficiency of nitrate tn and toc reached 86 56 40 60 and 90 25 respectively the maximum nitrate removal rate of strain wgx 9 reached 0 203 mg l h which was higher than that of strain janthinobacterium sp m 11 yang et al 2018 with a removal rate of 0 055 mg l h and acinetobacter harbinensis hitli7 t zheng et al 2018 with a removal rate of 0 029 mg l h in an oligotrophic condition during the aerobic denitrification process there was no formation of ammonium and no obvious accumulation of nitrite fig 1b the results of nitrogen balance analysis are shown in table s8 at the end of the process a comparison of the initial and final tn concentration in the medium showed that 19 93 of the no3 n was converted to intracellular nitrogen 26 28 was converted to nitrification products no2 n nh4 n and organic nitrogen and approximately 40 18 of the initial nitrogen was lost probably removed in the form of gas products these results indicate that strain wgx 9 is an aerobic denitrifier with a good aerobic denitrification performance 3 2 aerobic denitrification performance of strain wgx 9 with nom and iom as the carbon source with nom or iom as the sole carbon source the nitrate removal efficiency toc removal efficiency and maximum nitrate removal rate is shown in fig 2 the nitrogen and toc change during aerobic denitrification by strain wgx 9 is shown in fig s4 upon reaching the stationary phase the nitrate removal efficiency attained 16 50 19 04 25 20 and 30 98 and the maximum nitrate removal rate was 0 034 mg l h 0 036 mg l h 0 075 mg l h and 0 066 mg l h with ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source respectively with sodium acetate as the sole carbon source fig 1 the maximum nitrate removal efficiency and rate was 85 56 and 0 203 mg l h respectively and nom and iom showed relatively lower removal efficiency the bioavailability of sodium acetate was significantly higher than that of nom and iom and facilitated bacterial growth which may be used to explain the higher nitrate removal efficiency huang et al 2014 lee et al 2018 wen et al 2017 as shown in table 1 the maximum total cell concentration for ha fa ma iom and ch iom was 0 50 107 1 05 107 6 23 107 and 8 22 107 cells ml respectively which was lower than that of sodium acetate as the carbon source 1 23 108 cells ml the nitrate removal efficiency and rate with iom ma iom ch iom as the sole carbon source were relatively higher than those with nom ha fa as the sole carbon source which was probably attributed to their lower molecular weight as shown in section 3 3 and complex compositions egli 2010 zhang et al 2018b the comparisons of organic matter changes with ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source during aerobic denitrification were recorded using toc uv254 suva and eem as shown in fig 2 the toc change followed the same trend as that of nitrate with a greater toc removal efficiency than that of iom ma iom ch iom as the sole carbon source uv254 and suva representing the aromatic substances and difficult to be utilized by microorganisms lee et al 2018 are shown in table 2 during aerobic denitrification uv254 decreased gradually the results showed a lower aromatic content of ma iom and ch iom relative to ha and fa indicating that ma iom and ch iom were more easily utilized by strain wgx 9 than were ha and fa therefore the higher uv254 and suva of organic matter was an indicator of the lower nitrate removal efficiency and bacterial growth the eem spectra changes of ha fa ma iom and ch iom during aerobic denitrification by strain wgx 9 are shown in table s2 the ha peaks were mainly concentrated on polycarboxylate polyaromatic type humic acid ex em of 275 440 nm and 370 458 nm the fa peaks included fulvic acid like compounds ex em of 240 445 nm and humic acid like compounds ex em of 355 435 nm for ma iom the tryptophan like tyrosine like and humic fulvic acid like fluorescence was detected at an ex em of 275 334 nm 230 334 nm 280 452 nm and 370 452 nm the ch iom peaks involved tyrosine tryptophan protein at an ex em of 275 344 nm 230 344 nm the results of ma iom and ch iom manifested the same outcome as that reported previously henderson et al 2008 hua et al 2018 2019 after 96 h of cultivation the fluorescence intensity weakened and the iom ma iom ch iom decreased greatly relative to nom ha fa the changes indicated that biological degradation prioritizes the use of tyrosine tryptophan protein components in agreement with the results obtained in previous studies lee et al 2018 hur and kim 2009 hur et al 2011 based on this conclusion the removal efficiency of iom was found to be better than that of nom 3 3 characterizations of different mw fractions as shown in fig 3 the mw distribution of ha fa ma iom and ch iom was described by each fraction in toc the ha had the major distribution in a large mw portion 100 kda with a percentage of 77 11 with the smaller mw fractions 5 10 1 5 and 1 kda forming a total of 5 16 along with the remnant fractions of 30 100 kda and 10 30 kda at about 8 72 and 9 01 respectively fig 3a the result suggested that ha is generally composed of substances with a large mw whereas fa showed a different distribution six fractions in fa followed the order 100 kda 10 30 kda 30 100 kda 5 10 kda 1 5 kda 1 kda and accounted for 29 00 18 44 15 55 and 4 10 respectively fig 3a the result manifested that the mw distribution of fa was more uniform than that of ha with respect to ma iom the proportion of the 100 kda fraction was 44 97 the ratio of the 30 100 10 30 and 5 10 kda fractions was about 15 on average and the remaining small molecule 1 5 kda and 1 kda fractions accounted for 7 99 and 4 85 respectively fig 3b this result indicates that the fractions of mw 100 kda played a significant role in ma iom and further confirmed the results of a previous work hua et al 2019 guo et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 as for ch iom the mw distribution was more homogeneous in each mw fraction from 100 kda to 1 kda the proportion of different mw fractions was 24 81 16 86 19 78 15 55 13 98 and 8 87 respectively fig 3b which was slightly discrepant from the results of previous research hua et al 2019 zhou et al 2015 probably because of the difference in algal density and extraction methods the distribution of each mw fraction in uv254 showed a distribution similar to that of toc table s3 ha is generally composed of substances with mw 100 kda 70 70 the distribution of fa is mainly concentrated in 100 kda 29 84 and 10 30 kda 30 86 as for ma iom and ch iom the proportion of the mw 100 kda fraction was 46 56 and 23 97 respectively these results showed that iom showed lower mw distribution when compared with nom which may explain why the nitrate removal performance of iom is better than that of nom as shown in section 3 2 the eem spectrum of different mw fractions of ha fa ma iom and ch iom are shown in tables s4 s5 s6 and s7 with the initial 0 h with regard to ha different mw fractions were mainly composed of polyaromatic type humic acid similar to the original ha with the mw 100 kda fraction accounting for the highest fluorescence intensity 1761 a u for the fa in addition to the peaks of humic fulvic acid like the fluorescence peak representing tryptophan ex em of 275 334 nm and tyrosine proteins ex em of 230 334 nm appeared in 1 5 kda and 1 kda fraction the spectrum of ma iom varied greatly at different mw fractions the mw 100 kda mainly consisted of tyrosine tryptophan protein whereas both the tyrosine tryptophan protein and humic fulvic acid like emerged in other different mw fractions as for ch iom all the different mw fractions consisted of tyrosine tryptophan protein these results of ma iom and ch iom are in accordance with those reported in a previous study hua et al 2019 li et al 2012 the iom showed a complex composition including tyrosine tryptophan protein and humic fulvic acid like whereas nom showed only humic fulvic acid like which can explain why iom can show better improvement in the nitrate removal efficiency of strain wgx 9 3 4 nitrogen removal performance with different mw fractions as carbon source with different mw fractions of ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source nitrogen and toc removal by strain wgx 9 during the aerobic denitrification process is shown in fig s5 fig s6 fig s7 and fig s8 the nitrate removal efficiency and maximum nitrate removal rate with different mw fractions as the carbon source are shown in fig 4 an increase in nitrate removal efficiency and removal rate was observed for strain wgx 9 with decreasing mw for example the nitrate removal efficiency was 26 50 32 41 27 88 and 43 89 with mw 100 kda fraction as the carbon source whereas for mw 1 kda fraction it increased to 36 67 37 88 60 90 and 68 90 for ha fa ma iom and ch iom respectively according to the proportion and removal efficiency of each different mw fraction the average nitrate removal efficiency could be calculated as 28 05 26 76 44 10 and 56 20 with ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source respectively the calculated nitrate removal efficiency was slightly higher than that of the experimental results section 3 2 at 16 50 19 04 25 20 and 30 98 respectively the reasons for this result were attributed to the fractionally different mw organic matter which may provide more aoc for bacterial growth and more electron donors for the reduction of nitrate compared with the original organic matter hua et al 2019 furthermore the maximum nitrate removal rate showed a similar trend and reached 0 079 mg l h 0 084 mg l h 0 260 mg l h and 0 315 mg l h with the mw 1 kda fraction as the carbon source which was significantly higher than that of mw 100 kda with a removal rate of 0 059 mg l h 0 062 mg l h 0 104 mg l h and 0 083 mg l h for ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the carbon source respectively these results indicated that the smaller the mw of organic matter the better is the denitrification performance during the aerobic denitrification process with ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the carbon source at the same molecular weight such as mw 100 30 100 10 30 5 10 1 5 and 1 kda the nitrate removal efficiency and maximal nitrate removal rate with iom ma iom ch iom as the sole carbon source were relatively higher than that of with nom ha fa as the sole carbon source fig 4 fa and ch iom induced the nitrate removal efficiency higher compared with that of ha and ma iom similar to the ungraded nom and iom section 3 2 which may also be attributed to their lower molecular weight as shown in section 3 3 and complex compositions egli 2010 zhang et al 2018a 3 5 reasons for varying nitrate removal efficiency with different mw fractions as the carbon source 3 5 1 bacterial change with different mw fractions of ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source the tcc changes of strain wgx 9 are shown in table 3 the cell proliferation for the mw 100 kda is significantly less than the mw 1 kda for example the maximum cell density was 0 95 107 4 42 107 1 76 108 and 0 77 108 cells ml with the mw 100 kda fraction as the carbon source whereas for mw 1 kda it increased to 2 89 107 5 98 107 6 12 108 and 6 88 108 cells ml for ha fa ma iom and ch iom respectively the result indicated that the decrease in mw was beneficial to the growth of strain wgx 9 previous study showed that cell density is one of the significant factors affecting nitrate removal efficiency during aerobic denitrification zhang et al 2018b and analyzed the relationship between the tcc and nitrate concentrations there was a strong negative correlation in the periods of cultivation pearson s correlation r ha 0 962 p 0 001 n 8 r fa 0 973 p 0 001 n 8 r ma iom 0 968 p 0 001 n 8 r ch iom 0 988 p 0 001 n 8 this result was similar to that with pseudomonas stutzeri strain xl 2 zhao et al 2017 and paracoccus versutus ks293 zhang et al 2018a showing that nitrate removal efficiency was directly related to bacterial growth therefore the mw 1 kda fraction was found to be suitable for bacterial growth and was further beneficial to nitrate removal 3 5 2 toc change as shown in fig 5 the carbon removal efficiency of strain wgx 9 was described with different mw fractions of ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source toc removal efficiency increased from 13 80 32 41 44 12 and 42 33 34 80 52 67 70 90 and 70 89 respectively with the decrease in the fraction mw from 100 kda to 1 kda it could be inferred that strain wgx 9 performed toc removal effectively in the mw 1 kda and used the smaller mw organic matter efficiently which was the similar to the result obtained with janthinobacterium sp m 11 yang et al 2018 there was a significant positive correlation between nitrate concentrations and toc content in the cultivation period pearson s correlation r ha 0 913 p 0 001 n 8 r fa 0 945 p 0 001 n 8 r ma iom 0 981 p 0 001 n 8 r ch iom 0 965 p 0 001 n 8 this result suggested that the reduction in toc content would promote a significant decrease in nitrate concentration therefore in the smaller mw fraction more organic matter was utilized by strain wgx 9 resulting in higher toc removal and an increase in nitrate removal 3 5 3 uv254 and suva change fig 6 shows the uv254 changes in different mw fractions produced by strain wgx 9 using ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the sole carbon source table 4 shows suva changes in different mw fractions treated with strain wgx 9 during aerobic denitrification this shows that the uv254 and suva is lower in lower mw fractions for ha fa ma iom and ch iom this distinct tendency indicated that the uv254 removal efficiency was enhanced gradually with the decreasing mw of fractions with regard to ha fa ma iom and ch iom the uv254 removal efficiency increased from 8 32 9 40 50 00 and 47 80 31 40 40 60 64 31 and 63 62 respectively as the mw fraction decreased from 100 kda to 1 kda fig s9 generally uv254 represents a substance of macromolecules and suva reflects the aromaticity of organic matter previous studies showed that macromolecular and aromatic organic matter were hardly used by microorganisms kolehmainen et al 2007 henderson et al 2008 lee et al 2018 therefore the lower uv254 and suva may be one of the reasons for better nitrate removal efficiency in the fraction of mw 1 kda 3 5 4 fluorescence change during aerobic denitrification the fluorescence spectra of different mw fractions was changed after cultivation of strain wgx 9 for 96 h tables s4 s5 s6 s7 the change in fluorescence spectra before and after denitrification in the fraction of mw 100 kda and 1 kda is shown in fig 7 and fig 8 the fluorescence intensity of different mw fractions with respect to ha fa ma iom and ch iom was decreased after 96 h cultivation tables s4 s5 s6 s7 and the fraction of mw 1 kda manifested a greater decrease in fluorescence intensity when compared with that of mw 100 kda figs 7 and 8 in mw 1 kda the eem fluorescence spectra display more complex compositions and previous studies showed that a mixed carbon source can promote the growth of microorganisms egli 2010 and that biodegradation processes preferentially removed tyrosine tryptophan like or protein like components lee et al 2018 hur et al 2011 which may be another important reason for higher nitrate removal in smaller mw fractions 4 conclusions based on the experimental results of this study four main conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 a nitrate removal efficiency of 86 56 and a nitrate removal rate of 0 203 mg l h were reached with sodium acetate as the carbon source with the strain wgx 9 under aerobic conditions and strain wgx 9 was identified as acinetobacter johnsonii and the napa gene was amplified 2 lower nitrate removal efficiency by strain wgx 9 was observed using nom and iom as the sole carbon source when compared with that using sodium acetate and the nitrate removal efficiency and rate with iom as the sole carbon source was relatively higher than that with nom as the sole carbon source which may be due to the lower molecular weight and complex composition of iom 3 the fraction of mw 100 kda is the maximal portion of ha fa ma iom and ch iom with organic matter which accounts for 77 11 29 00 44 97 and 24 81 respectively according to the toc concentration furthermore according to the uv254 the proportion of mw 100 kda accounted for 70 70 29 84 46 56 and 23 97 4 these results illustrate that nitrate removal efficiency was improved with the decreasing mw of organic matter with the mw 1 kda the nitrate removal efficiency was increased to 36 67 37 88 60 90 and 68 90 using ha fa ma iom and ch iom as the carbon source respectively which may be because lower mw shows better bacterial growth and carbon source utilization ability and shows lower uv254 and suva to promote nitrate removal acknowledgements this work was supported by the natural science foundation of china no 51678472 shaanxi science fund for distinguished young scholars no

18568,this paper focused on the performance of an up flow bio electrochemical system ubes for treating the β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater under different hydraulic retention time hrt ubes is added a bio electrochemical system below the three phase separator based on up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb comparisons of chemical oxygen demand cod removal accumulation of volatile fatty acid vfa and biogas production were investigated during the 316 day operation time which was divided into five parts with hrt of 96 h 72 h 48 h 36 h and 20 h respectively the average cod removal efficiency of ubes could reach 45 3 7 5 72 2 3 5 86 2 1 4 75 9 1 8 and 64 9 2 0 which were 2 4 6 1 6 4 10 2 8 7 more than those of uasb under different hrts respectively biogas production as well as methane production of ubes were significantly higher than uasb during the whole changing hrt process the maximum methane yield of ubes was 0 31 0 07 l gcodremoved accumulation of vfa in ubes was discovered to be lighter than uasb the minimum average vfa in ubes was 131 9 18 5 mg l which was obtained at hrt of 48 h these results proved that ubes can slow down the inhibition of vfa on methanogens to make sure a good performance on cod removal and biogas production than uasb moreover the relationships between methane production and vfa biogas production and cod consumption were analyzed a cost and benefit were analyzed for evaluating the potential of ubes in practical applications compared with uasb finally radial basis function neural network rbfnn model was developed and fitted well with the experimental data which can be employed to predict the effluent quality of the ubes and uasb keywords up flow bio electrochemical system ubes up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater hydraulic retention time hrt volatile fatty acid vfa mathematical model 1 introduction in recent years with the increasing demand for antibiotics the discharge of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater has been widely concerned especially the residues of antibiotics in water can be detected frequently which is owing to a large amount of wastewater has not been properly treated or even directly discharged into the environment banjac et al 2015 luo et al 2014 the β lactams antibiotics as one of the most used antibiotics at clinical practice in worldwide the pollution caused by it to the water environment should not be underestimated thai et al 2018 dodd et al 2010 residues in the water environment may affect the evolution of bacterial community structure and enhance the drug resistance of bacteria guo et al 2016 bouki et al 2013 which is the potential threat to the ecological environment and the health of human the characteristics of β lactam pharmaceutical wastewater are complicated composition high concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod low biodegradability bacterial toxicity as well as refractory chen et al 2011 rolinson and geddes 2007 therefore it s need to be treated effectively in urgent most physical and chemical technologies have been used to remove residual of β lactam antibiotics such as photodegradation jung et al 2012 ferrate vi karlesa et al 2014 and peracetic acid oxidation zhang et al 2017 compared with these methods anaerobic biological treatment is widely concerned because of less cost and environmentally friendly huang et al 2018 anaerobic treatment such as anaerobic sequencing batch reactor ansbr up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr shi et al 2017 provide a new direction for the treatment of antibiotic wastewater with a high resistance to organic load low sludge production and high biogas production ji et al 2013a 2013b ward et al 2008 higher concentration of active microorganisms in uasb have higher removal capacity than other anaerobic technologies li et al 2015 chen et al 2014 meanwhile the three phase separator is an important part of uasb and it is located in the upper of the uasb three phase separator consists of sludge backflow gap sedimentation zone and gas seal can automatically separate the sludge wastewater and gas the main principle of three phase separator is that the gas in this reactor can be effectively discharged by the baffle to the gas collection device the sludge returns from the backflow gap to the sedimentation zone at the bottom of the reactor under the action of gravity and the wastewater is discharged through the overflow however accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa can adversely affect the anaerobic environment krakat et al 2010 chelliapan et al 2011 used uasb to treat pharmaceutical wastewater attained a 45 0 cod removal efficiency with a high vfa concentration in the study of shi et al 2014 only 34 1 cod removal efficiency was achieved by uasb at hrt of 36 h the above researches showed that a lower cod removal efficiency was received when an accumulation of vfa occurred by using uasb to treat high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater as a new process coupled with microbial and electrochemical system the emergence of bio electrochemical system bes provides a new way to overcome the deficiencies of anaerobic treatment patil et al 2013 many previous studies have shown that bes can increase reaction kinetics through biocatalysts and reduce energy consumption lin et al 2019 liang et al 2013 wang et al 2011 meanwhile cheng et al 2015 and wang et al 2014 have already used bes reactors to investigate electricity production effects bioenergy recovery and biogas production h2 or ch4 especially bio electrochemical treatment of antibiotic contaminants was proved be a useful method for reducing the ecological risk associated with the evolution of multidrug resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes during antibiotic containing wastewater treatment process liang et al 2019 however application of bes as an independent unit to treat wastewater could not attain a good performance de vrieze et al 2014 therefore shen et al 2014 studied the uasb bes mixed reactor which significantly improve the removal efficiency of p nitrophenol compared to the uasb furthermore jiang et al 2016 found that the uasb bes can effectively reduce the dechlorination of nitrobenzene and 2 4 dinitrochlorobenzene the observed high efficiency and stable performance highlighted the potential of the uasb bes coupling system especially for refractory contaminants removal however a comprehensive research is scanty about the treatment of β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater with a coupled reactor therefore in this paper a novel device for coupling uasb with membrane free electrode structure bes was proposed the design of up flow allowed β lactams to be sufficiently removed at the cathode chamber without poisoning and inhibiting the anode meanwhile effectively balancing the accumulation of protons in the anode chamber a comparison of operating performance for ubes and uasb was mainly studied under different hrts 96 h 72 h 48 h 36 h and 20 h the parameters of the investigation were cod removal change of vfa biogas production besides the relationships between methane production and vfa biogas production and cod consumption were also investigated and a cost and benefit were analyzed for evaluating the potential of ubes in practical applications compared with uasb meanwhile the radial basis function neural network rbfnn model was developed to predict the effluent quality of the ubes and uasb 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus a novel type of ubes based on an uasb is designed for treating β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater and compared with the traditional uasb fig 1 the ubes and uasb are made of plexiglass and ubes is added a bio electrochemical system of the uasb detailed parameters of the ubes and uasb used are listed as follows height is 25 0 cm internal diameter is 8 0 cm with the total volume is 2 7 l which can provide a net volume of 2 2 l wastewater is injected into the bottom of the reactors through a peristaltic pump longer bt300 2j longer pump co china and then pass through the granular anaerobic sludge layer and the suspended anaerobic sludge layer respectively then wastewater is overflowed through the three phase separator and the separated biogas is led out from the upper portion and collected by a gas collecting device the ubes is designed as a membrane free single chamber up flow system which built under the three phase separator of the uasb from bottom to top are the cathode chamber the reference electrode chamber saturated calomel electrode sce saturated kcl solution 241 mv versus standard hydrogen electrode and anode chamber the distance between the anode and cathode chamber is kept at 2 5 cm graphite granules with diameter from 3 0 to 5 0 mm harbin northern electrical carbon co ltd china are filled in the cathode and the anode chamber as a conductive material and the inserted carbon rods harbin northern electrical carbon co ltd china are finally used as electrode rods for electricity conductance the dc power supply is applied with an external voltage of 0 5 v and a 10 0 ω external resistor is connected to form a closed loop as the current sampler the potential and current of the cathode anode and reference electrode are collected on line through an external data acquisition system keithley 2700 keithley co usa and the frequency is collected every 10 min 2 2 the source and quality of the wastewater the wastewater was mixed in a certain ratio from the influent of anaerobic pool dagushan industrial park wastewater treatment plant liaoning province china the influent of anaerobic pool dalian hengji wastewater treatment plant liaoning province china and influent of an expanded granular sludge bed china resources snow beer dalian co ltd meanwhile the β lactams antibiotics such as amoxicillin ampicillin etc was added to mixed wastewater and tested at different hrts table 1 moreover in order to avoid the loss of sludge caused by nutrient deficiency appropriate amount of nutrients and trace elements were also added as shown in table 1 to ensure the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus ratio was kept at 300 5 1 2 3 inoculation and operation conditions the sludge culture of uasb and ubes was inoculated from the three anaerobic system as section 2 2 description and mixed with a ratio of 1 1 2 v v v table 2 the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of the mixed inoculated sludge was 36 8 g l the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss and mlvss mlss were 27 6 g l and 75 0 respectively the ubes and uasb were operated continuously for 316 days under five different parts table 3 the inoculated sludge was acclimated without antibiotics addition for 101 days with influent cod of 1000 2000 mg l part ii hrt 72 h day 61 day 165 was stable operating period influent cod was stepwise increased from 1000 mg l to 8000 mg l and the antibiotics were gradually added to the influent from 5 0 to 50 0 mg l at 101st day part iii 48 h part iv 36 h and part v 20 h were the comparison of performance of ubes and uasb and the β lactams antibiotics was maintained at 50 0 5 0 mg l moreover whether the change of influent cod would affect the operating of the two reactors under the same hrt conditions was also considered for instance part iv was further divided into stage r1 and stage r2 corresponding influent cod were 7000 8000 mg l and 5000 6000 mg l 2 4 analytical methods liquid samples taken from ubes and uasb were immediately analyzed for cod according to the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 ph and temperature were monitored real time by an on line sensor equipped with a portable ph and t meter multi3630 wtw gmbh germany the vfas were quantified with a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 usa equipped with an animex column 300 mm 7 8 mm aminex hpx 87h ion exclusion column usa and photo diode array pda detector at wavelength of 210 0 nm scoma et al 2016 the mobile phase was 0 5 h2so4 volume ratio at a flow rate of 0 6 ml min and the injection volume was 50 μl the alkalinity of bicarbonate were measured by titration lafay et al 2014 the biogas production and methane content were detected by a gas chromatograph gc2010 shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal performance fig 2 a and fig 2 b show the changes of influent cod effluent cod and cod removal efficiency in ubes and uasb at different hrts 96 72 48 36 and 20 h during the 316 days during the start up period hrt was kept at 96 h average cod removal efficiency of ubes and uasb were less than 60 and the cod removal efficiency of ubes did not showed an obviously advantages than uasb as the electroactive biofilm of the electrode was gradually formed after about 2 months operation the two reactors with a steady state of cod removal performance demonstrated that uasb and ubes were start up successfully during the part ii operation after reducing hrt to 72 h the cod removal efficiency of ubes and uasb both showed an increase trend which with a steady state of higher than 70 about 40 days operation then the β lactams antibiotics were added into to the system stepwise from 5 0 to 50 0 mg l on the 106th day which lead to a 7 7 and 11 1 of cod removal efficiency decreased of ubes and uasb respectively this could be explained that the microorganisms in the reactors were inhibited by antibiotics result in a decrease cod removal efficiency meng et al 2017 influent cod of two reactors continued to increase from 4000 mg l to 8000 mg l and finally controlled at 8000 200 mg l the temperature in both reactors was decreased to 25 3 c during 140 146 days which was due to the failure of the temperature control system temperature changes brought serious impact to uasb cod removal efficiency of uasb was decreased to 63 6 it was interesting that the cod removal efficiency of ubes was still maintained above 70 as the implantation of bes module built in can enhance the load resistance of the anaerobic reactors especially to mitigate the adverse effects of temperature shock on the systems moreover liang et al 2016 also demonstrated that bes has a stably removal performance for antibiotics even at low temperature of 10 c as the functional microbial communities in the bes can keep stability these results also indicated the employment of bes module in the upper side of uasb can enhance the pollutants removal to ensure a high removal efficiency of the ubes the reasons can be attribute to the electron transfer between electrodes and microorganisms provided electron donors for microbial metabolism thereby made up for the lack of electron donors in uasb enhancing microbial metabolism the maximum values of cod removal efficiency were obtained at hrt of 48 h both in ubes and uasb which were 89 3 and 81 5 with the average effluent cod of 1091 95 mg l and 1599 118 mg l respectively with the decrease of hrt to 36 h the effluent cod of the two reactors showed an increasingly trend which indicated that organic matter could not be degraded effectively at this stage obviously cod removal efficiency of ubes was still higher than uasb at hrt of 36 h and the cod removal efficiency of ubes even observed 20 3 higher than the uasb demonstrated that ubes also had a strong resistance to loading rate meanwhile the electrode module built in ubes ensured a relatively stable anaerobic environment making sure a high pollutants removal efficiency jiang et al 2016 on the 242nd day influent cod of two reactors was reduced to 5000 6000 mg l cod removal efficiency gradually recovered to a similar removal efficiency as hrt of 48 h which was similar to the result of shi et al 2014 got when hrt 20 h the biochemical reaction time of the metabolic substrate was dramatically reduced chelliapan et al 2011 the cod removal efficiency of uasb was greatly reduced to less than 60 meanwhile the cod removal efficiency of ubes also significantly reduced but maintained at about 65 as the above descriptions under the same conditions the average cod removal efficiency of ubes was 8 5 higher than uasb when hrt was above 20 h and the optimum range of hrt for ubes and uasb was 36 48 h 3 2 vfa and alkalinity characteristics the effluent vfa and alkalinity are important indicators for ubes and uasb and the ratio α of both vfa and alkalinity is more intuitive to express the relationship between them related changes are shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3 a that the accumulation of vfa was occurred in uasb at hrt of 96 h and the highest value was 583 8 mg l the alkalinity below 1000 mg l did not play a role in neutralizing the accumulated vfa for the ubes the accumulation of vfa was alleviated as bes module could be efficiently utilize vfa for pollutant degradation cui et al 2014 however the concentration of vfa was always high during this stage proving an overlong hrt will cause a large accumulation of vfa which was not suitable for the growth of microorganisms after reducing hrt to 72 h the vfa of both ubes and uasb all showed a downward trend the alkalinity of ubes and uasb both showed an unstable increased state as the methanogens in this period did not fully adapt to the environment since a lower alkalinity was monitored at the uasb an appropriate amount of sodium bicarbonate solution was added to ensure the normal operation of the uasb on 76th day on the contrary the ubes can self provide a steadily alkalinity level to maintain the anaerobic operation without extra alkaline substances addition it was worthy to note that during 141st to 146th day the values of vfa in uasb suddenly rose up as the sudden drop in temperature of the reaction system the ubes did not observed obviously shock of vfa during these day also indicated ubes had excellent impact resistance compared with uasb since 156th day the α value of ubes and uasb stabilized at 0 08 and 0 11 respectively khoufi et al 2015 had observed that the α value of the anaerobic reactor to be successfully operated needed to be less than 0 3 which proved that our reactors were stable during the part iii to part v the average effluent vfa alkalinity and α value of ubes at hrt of 48 h were 132 18 mg l 3245 240 mg l and 0 04 0 01 respectively which was all superior to uasb 208 13 mg l 2486 87 mg l and 0 08 0 01 under the stage r1 of hrt of 36 h vfa of both ubes and uasb were increased and average vfa were 206 31 mg l and 287 40 mg l respectively chelliapan et al 2011 reported that microorganisms in anaerobic reactor for treating pharmaceutical wastewater cannot withstand excessive organic loading and leads the reduction of organic removal efficiency interestingly although a decrease of alkalinity in ubes was found at hrt of 36 h the average alkalinity of ubes was still higher than the average alkalinity of uasb at hrt of 48 h which also demonstrated that ubes can withstand high cod loading rate when the hrt were shortened to 20 h vfa of uasb further accumulated average vfa increased from 239 36 mg l stage r2 to 632 87 mg l stage r1 it s worthy to be noted that as the increasingly of vfa and decreasingly of alkalinity led the average value of α in uasb dramatically increased to 0 37 0 05 which was much higher than 0 3 on the contrary effluent vfa of ubes showed a slightly upward trend and the alkalinity also showed slightly decreased trend and the average value of α was stable at about 0 13 0 03 this probably due to a small amount of electrode active bacteria which can effectively use vfa acetate as the substrate cui et al 2014 for current generation in the bes system thus ensuring a lower effluent vfa the vfa alkalinity and α values of the two reactors could not be restored to the level observed at part iii and part iv even the cod loading rate was reduced to the same value of part iii and part iv during the stage r2 the results indicating that hrt of 20 h was the limitation for the two reactors as the microbial activity was affected and degrade pollutants was burdensome under the high loading rate conditions however it is noted that the ubes with a superior condition to the uasb at the whole experimental operation as the bes module implantation 3 3 biogas and methane production biogas and methane production of ubes and uasb were shown in fig 4 the amount of biogas production at start up period was extremely low with average of 24 4 ml d and 15 3 ml d in ubes and uasb respectively the low production of methane in the ubes during the start up period was owing to the competition between the electrogenic and methanogenic bacteria at lower organic loading rate which the process of methanogenesis was inhibited vamshi krishna and venkata mohan 2016 the methanogenic rate of ubes was observed with an upward trend and more stable than the uasb with the acclimation of sludge and the further increase of loading rate the biogas and methane production in ubes and uasb were increased obviously since 111st day it was worth to note that the operation temperature of the two reactors was reduced to the ambient temperature of 25 3 c in 140th to 146th day the decrease of temperature caused uasb to be subjected to a certain impact and in a decrease in the biogas production which proved that shock temperature had a significant impact on methanogens hu et al 2017 jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 however the impact of temperature fluctuations is inhibited by the bes module as more diversity microbial community in the ubes it was observed that the biogas production and methane production of ubes were significantly higher than uasb under different hrt conditions the maximum biogas production of the two reactors was observed at 3526 ml d ubes and 2669 ml d uasb respectively it can be seen from fig 4 b that the highest average percentage of methane of uasb was observed at hrt of 48 h 71 6 4 1 with the shortening of hrt to 20 h the average percentage of methane decreased to 41 2 5 7 significantly the highest average percentage of methane of ubes was obtained at stage r2 77 6 1 9 and the average values during part ii to part v were 60 9 16 4 indicating the anaerobic digestion reaction in the ubes system was carried out thoroughly other researchers had reported similar results from the treatment of antibiotic wastewater hoffmann and drescher 2005 s study showed that more biogas could be produced by mixed reactors ng et al 2015 employed an anaerobic membrane bioreactor to treat pharmaceutical wastewater nearly 60 70 of methane was present in the biogas produced under steady state conditions from the above descriptions it was concluded that the best hrt for ubes to produce biogas was 36 h 3 4 comparison and analysis of performance based on a literature survey carried out on β lactams wastewater treatment the proposed method ubes in this study was compared with the other methods a listing has been made of the anaerobic biological treatment technologies in table 4 it s undoubted that anaerobic processes are more applicable for β lactams wastewater treatment zhou et al 2006 used a pilot scale anaerobic baffled reactor abr to treat ampicillin and aureomycin wastewater under hrt 60 h compared to this results the ubes achieved similar cod removal efficiency under shorter hrt conditions hrt 48 h oktem et al 2008 used a lab scale hybrid uasb to treat bacampicilline and sultampicilline tosylate wastewater achieved 83 cod removal efficiency at an organic loading rate olr of 4 kgcod m3 d however ubes achieved 89 cod removal efficiency under the same olr proved the outstanding performance of ubes it was worth noting that ubes achieved a better performance of cod removal than huang et al 2018 attained further proved the feasibility of treating β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater by ubes meantime it can be found in table 4 the accumulation of vfa in ubes was less than li et al 2019 and huang et al 2018 got under similar olr conditions and the lowest vfa concentration attained by chen et al 2011 was still higher than that of ubes these phenomena further demonstrated that ubes was better able to reduce the accumulation of vfa thus ensuring the normal operation higher alkalinity than the result of zhou et al 2006 also proved that ubes had a better condition for microorganisms to remove contaminants the average methane yield of the ubes under hrt 48 h with an average value of 0 31 0 07 l gcodremoved which was higher with the study reported by huang et al 2018 ng et al 2015 meng et al 2015 and shi et al 2014 moreover the average methane yield of the ubes at stage r2 was relatively consistent with the study reported by li et al 2019 who applied the pilot scale egsb for the treatment of cephalosporin wastewater these all indicated that ubes had good methane production 3 5 analysis of the relationship between methane production and vfa vfa is an important intermediate in the anaerobic process which mainly used for methanogens to form methane and high vfa accumulation has an inhibitory effect on methanogens gao et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 fig 5 shows the relationship between methane production and vfa in ubes and uasb it can be found that the change of vfa had a significant influence on methane production which can be expressed by mathematical fitting analysis it can be clearly found that with the increase of vfa the amount of methane production in ubes and uasb at hrt of 72 h all showed a rapidly downward trend which proved that excessive accumulation of vfa had a negative feedback effect on methanogens with the changes of hrts the relationship between methane production and vfa in ubes and uasb were exhibited a same variation trend at hrt of 48 h and 36 h it is interesting to observed that an increasingly vfa accumulation within a certain range appropriately had a positive promotion contribute to the methane production process of the methanogen moreover the increase of vfa in ubes with the range of 140 190 mg l at hrt of 36 h showed largest significant positive effect on the increase of methane production when switched hrt to 20 h the relationship between the methane production and vfa accumulation of the two reactors showed a significant decline the slope of the ubes fitting curve y 0 001x 3 0 789x 2 201 81x 14176 r2 0 955 was much flatter than the uasb fitting curve y 0 0002x 3 0 357x 2 230 37x 47968 r2 0 925 further demonstrated ubes was superior to the resistance for loading rate shock meanwhile a lower concentration of vfa in ubes reflected ubes could slow down the inhibition of vfa on methanogens these phenomena also indicated that properly hrt and well controlled vfa concentration were crucial to receive a favorable methane production performance 3 6 relationships between cod consumption and biogas production the relationships between biogas production qbiogas and cod consumption δcod under different hrts in the two reactors could be obtained through different functions such as the linear fitting quadratic polynomial fitting power equation fitting and exponential equation fitting as shown in fig 6 a series of formulas about the relationship between qbiogas and δcod were obtained as eq 2 which were more precise compared with the classical formula 1 1 q a v s 0 s e η 1000 t where q a is biogas production nm3 d v is effective volume m3 η is biogas yield m3 kgcod s 0 is influent cod mgcod l s e is effluent cod mgcod l t is hydraulic retention time d the general formulas for ubes and uasb under different hrts established as follows 2 h r t 72 h q b i o g a s a δ c o d b h r t 48 h

uasb showed a significant linear positive correlation between qbiogas and δcod under hrt of 72 h and the linear coefficient of ubes 0 162 was higher than the uasb 0 142 indicated ubes has higher biogas conversion efficiency and can promote the anaerobic biogas production when hrt was 48 h the fitting curve cannot well match r2 0 231 for ubes and r2 0 241 of uasb with the actual data of qbiogas and δcod but it could be concluded that ubes was kept at a more stable upward trend compared with uasb when hrt reduced to 36 h exponential function and power function were established for simulating the relationship between qbiogas and δcod under stage r1 and stage r2 respectively that of uasb showed a steady upward trend at stage r1 the coefficient of ubes 2597 2 was still higher than uasb 1554 1 even the fitting performance of ubes r2 0 741 was slightly worse than uasb r2 0 976 at stage r2 the coefficient of ubes model 2599 5 higher than the uasb 1734 6 also can support that ubes has higher cod treatment capacity and biogas production the stability of the relationship between qbiogas and δcod of the two reactors at hrt 20 h was obviously lower than her of 36 h and the corresponding coefficients of ubes and uasb were also significantly lower than the coefficients which observed under hrt of 36 h which indicated that lower hrt had a significant effect on cod removal and biogas production in both reactors 3 7 analysis of standard deviations and relative deviations standard deviations and relative deviations were applied to compare the different performance between ubes and uasb the formulas as follows 5 s d 1 n i 1 n x i μ 2 where s d is standard deviation x i is the values of samples μ represents the mean of x 1 to x n n is the number of samples 6 r d u 1 u 2 u 1 100 where r d is relative deviation u 1 and u 2 are effluent cod cod removal efficiency vfa alkalinity and biogas production in uasb and ubes respectively the results of sd and rd are shown in table 5 it can be clearly found that ubes had a more stable performance than uasb in cod removal and vfa under all hrt conditions although the sd of cod removal efficiency of ubes at hrt of 48 h was slightly higher than uasb the sd of effluent cod was less than uasb the reason of the difference between ubes and uasb about the alkalinity and biogas production was that alkalinity and biogas production in ubes continued to increase with the gradual stabilization of the operation conditions rd was used to evaluate the deviation of the ubes in effluent cod cod removal efficiency vfa alkalinity and biogas production from that of uasb under different conditions obviously rd between ubes and uasb in cod removal was larger under the stage r3 of hrt 72 h hrt 48 h and stage r1 of hrt 36 h proved that ubes had a superior cod removal than uasb and the maximum deviation was observed higher than 40 under low hrt conditions rd of vfa between ubes and uasb was larger than longer hrt which further confirmed the conclusion that the previously obtained ubes can effectively reduce the accumulation of vfa moreover the relatively large rd of biogas production proved that ubes had better biogas production than uasb 3 8 techno economic analysis a cost and benefit analysis are necessary for evaluating the potential of ubes in practical applications compared with uasb at one side the ubes can enhance the pollutants removal and biogas production however at other side the ubes need more external energy consumption and capital cost for the electrode module wang et al 2017 thus it is necessary to perform a techno economic analysis that takes both of the pollutant removal and the material cost into account the capital cost and operation cost of the ubes and uasb were calculated in the supplementary material section 1 table s1 showed that there were polynomial functions between the unit capital cost and cod loading rate lr as eq 7 and fig 7 a 7 u c a p u a s b 4 32 l r 2 51 77 l r 193 8 r 2 0 934 u c a p u b e s 4 63 l r 2 56 60 l r 217 0 r 2 0 983 where u c a p u a s b and u c a p u b e s represent the unit capital cost of uasb and ubes us kgcodremoved lr represents the cod loading rate kgcod m3 d the polynomial functions between the unit operation cost and cod loading rate lr as eq 8 and fig 7b 8 o p e u a s b 4 36 10 2 l r 2 0 346 l r 1 158 r 2 0 794 o p e u b e s 3 90 10 2 l r 2 0 318 l r 1 036 r 2 0 602 where o p e u a s b and o p e u b e s represent the unit capital cost of uasb and ubes us kgcodremoved the unit capital cost of ubes was higher than uasb under all the cod loading rate conditions due to the electrode module built in the ubes the unit capital cost difference between uasb and ubes was smaller as the increasingly cod loading rate fig 7 a indicating that ubes has higher capacity for treating the high load β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater for the unit operation cost ubes was observed much lower than the uasb under all the cod loading rate conditions there are several possible reasons for the lower unit operation cost in the ubes the higher amount of cod removed for unit reactor volume can reduce the unit pump heating and chemical consumption in ubes moreover the higher specific methane production in ubes means more energy can recover from the wastewater it is noted that the power consumption for the electrode module in ubes can be negligible as the power consumption for the electrode module only accounts 1 0 56 0 98 of the total unit operation cost in ubes from fig 7b we also observed that the lowest unit operation cost of uasb and ubes was observed about cod loading rate of 4 0 kgcod m3 d this result suggested that the economically optimal operation was cod loading rate hold at 4 0 kgcod m3 d for ubes and uabs the payback period for upgrading uasb to ubes by built in electrode module was list as eq 9 and fig 7c 9 p p u c a p u b e s u c a p u a s b o p e u a s b o p e u b e s q u b e s where p p represent the payback period d the results showed that ubes is profitable for β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater as the payback period was lower than 0 5 year with cod loading rate from 2 0 to 7 0 kgcod m3 d moreover a decreased trend as the increasing cod loading rate was also indicated ubes was superior to treat high loading rate wastewater 3 9 rbfnn model the radial basis function neural network rbfnn model was constructed to simulate and predict the effluent cod of ubes and uasb the rbfnn model was established by using the software spss17 0 taking several parameters into account influent cod vfa alkalinity and hrt the networks comprised four nodes in input layers undetermined nodes in hidden layer and an output node effluent cod the networks were trained by using the training data set 1st 196th days ubes and 1st 206th days uasb and then validated with the testing data set 197th 316th days ubes and 207th 316th days uasb the specific rbfnn model was calculated in the supplementary material section 2 the prediction performance of the model during the debugging and perfecting by adjusting node numbers were attained rbfnn architecture were 4 8 1 ubes and 4 10 1 uasb the relative error in training phase were 0 070 and 0 064 moreover in testing phase the values were 0 132 and 0 044 respectively for achieving an anticipated result the number of neurons in the hidden layer of different output layer were varied it can be seen in fig 8 a b the normalized importance for hrt alkalinity vfa and influent cod were 100 0 73 6 71 0 81 2 ubes and 77 7 72 8 57 2 100 uasb respectively which showed that the models for ubes and uasb could simulate the degree of influence of the respective variables during the operation time the experimental observed and model simulated the values of effluent cod for ubes and uasb during rbfnn training and testing were shown in fig 9 a b in training phase and testing phase there were fit in the trends between the simulated and the experimental data the simulation models built on the rbfnn theory were practical and feasible to simulate and predict the effluent cod in ubes and uasb which can be employed to predict the effluent quality of them 4 conclusion in this work a novel ubes reactor was set up for treating β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater which technical feasibility and long term operation performance were discussed to determine reasonable hrt parameters by comparison with uasb the conclusions were summarized as follows 1 it was feasible to use ubes for treating β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater which had better degradation performance on cod than uasb the optimal hrt of ubes was controlled at 48 h 2 membrane free electrode structure of ubes alleviated the accumulation of vfa slowed down the inhibition of vfa on methanogens and contributed to the improvement of biogas production 3 the techno economic analysis demonstrated ubes was profitable for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and the optimal cod loading rate was 4 0 kgcod m3 d 4 the relationships between methane production and vfa as well as biogas production and cod consumption were analyzed respectively which proved a properly selected hrt and a well posed range vfa were important in order to receive a favorable biogas production 5 rbfnn model could fit well with the experimental data which can be employed to reflect and predict the

18568,this paper focused on the performance of an up flow bio electrochemical system ubes for treating the β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater under different hydraulic retention time hrt ubes is added a bio electrochemical system below the three phase separator based on up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb comparisons of chemical oxygen demand cod removal accumulation of volatile fatty acid vfa and biogas production were investigated during the 316 day operation time which was divided into five parts with hrt of 96 h 72 h 48 h 36 h and 20 h respectively the average cod removal efficiency of ubes could reach 45 3 7 5 72 2 3 5 86 2 1 4 75 9 1 8 and 64 9 2 0 which were 2 4 6 1 6 4 10 2 8 7 more than those of uasb under different hrts respectively biogas production as well as methane production of ubes were significantly higher than uasb during the whole changing hrt process the maximum methane yield of ubes was 0 31 0 07 l gcodremoved accumulation of vfa in ubes was discovered to be lighter than uasb the minimum average vfa in ubes was 131 9 18 5 mg l which was obtained at hrt of 48 h these results proved that ubes can slow down the inhibition of vfa on methanogens to make sure a good performance on cod removal and biogas production than uasb moreover the relationships between methane production and vfa biogas production and cod consumption were analyzed a cost and benefit were analyzed for evaluating the potential of ubes in practical applications compared with uasb finally radial basis function neural network rbfnn model was developed and fitted well with the experimental data which can be employed to predict the effluent quality of the ubes and uasb keywords up flow bio electrochemical system ubes up flow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater hydraulic retention time hrt volatile fatty acid vfa mathematical model 1 introduction in recent years with the increasing demand for antibiotics the discharge of antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater has been widely concerned especially the residues of antibiotics in water can be detected frequently which is owing to a large amount of wastewater has not been properly treated or even directly discharged into the environment banjac et al 2015 luo et al 2014 the β lactams antibiotics as one of the most used antibiotics at clinical practice in worldwide the pollution caused by it to the water environment should not be underestimated thai et al 2018 dodd et al 2010 residues in the water environment may affect the evolution of bacterial community structure and enhance the drug resistance of bacteria guo et al 2016 bouki et al 2013 which is the potential threat to the ecological environment and the health of human the characteristics of β lactam pharmaceutical wastewater are complicated composition high concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod low biodegradability bacterial toxicity as well as refractory chen et al 2011 rolinson and geddes 2007 therefore it s need to be treated effectively in urgent most physical and chemical technologies have been used to remove residual of β lactam antibiotics such as photodegradation jung et al 2012 ferrate vi karlesa et al 2014 and peracetic acid oxidation zhang et al 2017 compared with these methods anaerobic biological treatment is widely concerned because of less cost and environmentally friendly huang et al 2018 anaerobic treatment such as anaerobic sequencing batch reactor ansbr up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor uasb anaerobic membrane bioreactor anmbr moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr shi et al 2017 provide a new direction for the treatment of antibiotic wastewater with a high resistance to organic load low sludge production and high biogas production ji et al 2013a 2013b ward et al 2008 higher concentration of active microorganisms in uasb have higher removal capacity than other anaerobic technologies li et al 2015 chen et al 2014 meanwhile the three phase separator is an important part of uasb and it is located in the upper of the uasb three phase separator consists of sludge backflow gap sedimentation zone and gas seal can automatically separate the sludge wastewater and gas the main principle of three phase separator is that the gas in this reactor can be effectively discharged by the baffle to the gas collection device the sludge returns from the backflow gap to the sedimentation zone at the bottom of the reactor under the action of gravity and the wastewater is discharged through the overflow however accumulation of volatile fatty acids vfa can adversely affect the anaerobic environment krakat et al 2010 chelliapan et al 2011 used uasb to treat pharmaceutical wastewater attained a 45 0 cod removal efficiency with a high vfa concentration in the study of shi et al 2014 only 34 1 cod removal efficiency was achieved by uasb at hrt of 36 h the above researches showed that a lower cod removal efficiency was received when an accumulation of vfa occurred by using uasb to treat high concentration pharmaceutical wastewater as a new process coupled with microbial and electrochemical system the emergence of bio electrochemical system bes provides a new way to overcome the deficiencies of anaerobic treatment patil et al 2013 many previous studies have shown that bes can increase reaction kinetics through biocatalysts and reduce energy consumption lin et al 2019 liang et al 2013 wang et al 2011 meanwhile cheng et al 2015 and wang et al 2014 have already used bes reactors to investigate electricity production effects bioenergy recovery and biogas production h2 or ch4 especially bio electrochemical treatment of antibiotic contaminants was proved be a useful method for reducing the ecological risk associated with the evolution of multidrug resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes during antibiotic containing wastewater treatment process liang et al 2019 however application of bes as an independent unit to treat wastewater could not attain a good performance de vrieze et al 2014 therefore shen et al 2014 studied the uasb bes mixed reactor which significantly improve the removal efficiency of p nitrophenol compared to the uasb furthermore jiang et al 2016 found that the uasb bes can effectively reduce the dechlorination of nitrobenzene and 2 4 dinitrochlorobenzene the observed high efficiency and stable performance highlighted the potential of the uasb bes coupling system especially for refractory contaminants removal however a comprehensive research is scanty about the treatment of β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater with a coupled reactor therefore in this paper a novel device for coupling uasb with membrane free electrode structure bes was proposed the design of up flow allowed β lactams to be sufficiently removed at the cathode chamber without poisoning and inhibiting the anode meanwhile effectively balancing the accumulation of protons in the anode chamber a comparison of operating performance for ubes and uasb was mainly studied under different hrts 96 h 72 h 48 h 36 h and 20 h the parameters of the investigation were cod removal change of vfa biogas production besides the relationships between methane production and vfa biogas production and cod consumption were also investigated and a cost and benefit were analyzed for evaluating the potential of ubes in practical applications compared with uasb meanwhile the radial basis function neural network rbfnn model was developed to predict the effluent quality of the ubes and uasb 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental apparatus a novel type of ubes based on an uasb is designed for treating β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater and compared with the traditional uasb fig 1 the ubes and uasb are made of plexiglass and ubes is added a bio electrochemical system of the uasb detailed parameters of the ubes and uasb used are listed as follows height is 25 0 cm internal diameter is 8 0 cm with the total volume is 2 7 l which can provide a net volume of 2 2 l wastewater is injected into the bottom of the reactors through a peristaltic pump longer bt300 2j longer pump co china and then pass through the granular anaerobic sludge layer and the suspended anaerobic sludge layer respectively then wastewater is overflowed through the three phase separator and the separated biogas is led out from the upper portion and collected by a gas collecting device the ubes is designed as a membrane free single chamber up flow system which built under the three phase separator of the uasb from bottom to top are the cathode chamber the reference electrode chamber saturated calomel electrode sce saturated kcl solution 241 mv versus standard hydrogen electrode and anode chamber the distance between the anode and cathode chamber is kept at 2 5 cm graphite granules with diameter from 3 0 to 5 0 mm harbin northern electrical carbon co ltd china are filled in the cathode and the anode chamber as a conductive material and the inserted carbon rods harbin northern electrical carbon co ltd china are finally used as electrode rods for electricity conductance the dc power supply is applied with an external voltage of 0 5 v and a 10 0 ω external resistor is connected to form a closed loop as the current sampler the potential and current of the cathode anode and reference electrode are collected on line through an external data acquisition system keithley 2700 keithley co usa and the frequency is collected every 10 min 2 2 the source and quality of the wastewater the wastewater was mixed in a certain ratio from the influent of anaerobic pool dagushan industrial park wastewater treatment plant liaoning province china the influent of anaerobic pool dalian hengji wastewater treatment plant liaoning province china and influent of an expanded granular sludge bed china resources snow beer dalian co ltd meanwhile the β lactams antibiotics such as amoxicillin ampicillin etc was added to mixed wastewater and tested at different hrts table 1 moreover in order to avoid the loss of sludge caused by nutrient deficiency appropriate amount of nutrients and trace elements were also added as shown in table 1 to ensure the carbon nitrogen and phosphorus ratio was kept at 300 5 1 2 3 inoculation and operation conditions the sludge culture of uasb and ubes was inoculated from the three anaerobic system as section 2 2 description and mixed with a ratio of 1 1 2 v v v table 2 the mixed liquid suspended solids mlss of the mixed inoculated sludge was 36 8 g l the mixed liquid volatile suspended solids mlvss and mlvss mlss were 27 6 g l and 75 0 respectively the ubes and uasb were operated continuously for 316 days under five different parts table 3 the inoculated sludge was acclimated without antibiotics addition for 101 days with influent cod of 1000 2000 mg l part ii hrt 72 h day 61 day 165 was stable operating period influent cod was stepwise increased from 1000 mg l to 8000 mg l and the antibiotics were gradually added to the influent from 5 0 to 50 0 mg l at 101st day part iii 48 h part iv 36 h and part v 20 h were the comparison of performance of ubes and uasb and the β lactams antibiotics was maintained at 50 0 5 0 mg l moreover whether the change of influent cod would affect the operating of the two reactors under the same hrt conditions was also considered for instance part iv was further divided into stage r1 and stage r2 corresponding influent cod were 7000 8000 mg l and 5000 6000 mg l 2 4 analytical methods liquid samples taken from ubes and uasb were immediately analyzed for cod according to the standard methods for examination of water and wastewater apha 2005 ph and temperature were monitored real time by an on line sensor equipped with a portable ph and t meter multi3630 wtw gmbh germany the vfas were quantified with a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1100 usa equipped with an animex column 300 mm 7 8 mm aminex hpx 87h ion exclusion column usa and photo diode array pda detector at wavelength of 210 0 nm scoma et al 2016 the mobile phase was 0 5 h2so4 volume ratio at a flow rate of 0 6 ml min and the injection volume was 50 μl the alkalinity of bicarbonate were measured by titration lafay et al 2014 the biogas production and methane content were detected by a gas chromatograph gc2010 shimadzu japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal performance fig 2 a and fig 2 b show the changes of influent cod effluent cod and cod removal efficiency in ubes and uasb at different hrts 96 72 48 36 and 20 h during the 316 days during the start up period hrt was kept at 96 h average cod removal efficiency of ubes and uasb were less than 60 and the cod removal efficiency of ubes did not showed an obviously advantages than uasb as the electroactive biofilm of the electrode was gradually formed after about 2 months operation the two reactors with a steady state of cod removal performance demonstrated that uasb and ubes were start up successfully during the part ii operation after reducing hrt to 72 h the cod removal efficiency of ubes and uasb both showed an increase trend which with a steady state of higher than 70 about 40 days operation then the β lactams antibiotics were added into to the system stepwise from 5 0 to 50 0 mg l on the 106th day which lead to a 7 7 and 11 1 of cod removal efficiency decreased of ubes and uasb respectively this could be explained that the microorganisms in the reactors were inhibited by antibiotics result in a decrease cod removal efficiency meng et al 2017 influent cod of two reactors continued to increase from 4000 mg l to 8000 mg l and finally controlled at 8000 200 mg l the temperature in both reactors was decreased to 25 3 c during 140 146 days which was due to the failure of the temperature control system temperature changes brought serious impact to uasb cod removal efficiency of uasb was decreased to 63 6 it was interesting that the cod removal efficiency of ubes was still maintained above 70 as the implantation of bes module built in can enhance the load resistance of the anaerobic reactors especially to mitigate the adverse effects of temperature shock on the systems moreover liang et al 2016 also demonstrated that bes has a stably removal performance for antibiotics even at low temperature of 10 c as the functional microbial communities in the bes can keep stability these results also indicated the employment of bes module in the upper side of uasb can enhance the pollutants removal to ensure a high removal efficiency of the ubes the reasons can be attribute to the electron transfer between electrodes and microorganisms provided electron donors for microbial metabolism thereby made up for the lack of electron donors in uasb enhancing microbial metabolism the maximum values of cod removal efficiency were obtained at hrt of 48 h both in ubes and uasb which were 89 3 and 81 5 with the average effluent cod of 1091 95 mg l and 1599 118 mg l respectively with the decrease of hrt to 36 h the effluent cod of the two reactors showed an increasingly trend which indicated that organic matter could not be degraded effectively at this stage obviously cod removal efficiency of ubes was still higher than uasb at hrt of 36 h and the cod removal efficiency of ubes even observed 20 3 higher than the uasb demonstrated that ubes also had a strong resistance to loading rate meanwhile the electrode module built in ubes ensured a relatively stable anaerobic environment making sure a high pollutants removal efficiency jiang et al 2016 on the 242nd day influent cod of two reactors was reduced to 5000 6000 mg l cod removal efficiency gradually recovered to a similar removal efficiency as hrt of 48 h which was similar to the result of shi et al 2014 got when hrt 20 h the biochemical reaction time of the metabolic substrate was dramatically reduced chelliapan et al 2011 the cod removal efficiency of uasb was greatly reduced to less than 60 meanwhile the cod removal efficiency of ubes also significantly reduced but maintained at about 65 as the above descriptions under the same conditions the average cod removal efficiency of ubes was 8 5 higher than uasb when hrt was above 20 h and the optimum range of hrt for ubes and uasb was 36 48 h 3 2 vfa and alkalinity characteristics the effluent vfa and alkalinity are important indicators for ubes and uasb and the ratio α of both vfa and alkalinity is more intuitive to express the relationship between them related changes are shown in fig 3 it can be seen from fig 3 a that the accumulation of vfa was occurred in uasb at hrt of 96 h and the highest value was 583 8 mg l the alkalinity below 1000 mg l did not play a role in neutralizing the accumulated vfa for the ubes the accumulation of vfa was alleviated as bes module could be efficiently utilize vfa for pollutant degradation cui et al 2014 however the concentration of vfa was always high during this stage proving an overlong hrt will cause a large accumulation of vfa which was not suitable for the growth of microorganisms after reducing hrt to 72 h the vfa of both ubes and uasb all showed a downward trend the alkalinity of ubes and uasb both showed an unstable increased state as the methanogens in this period did not fully adapt to the environment since a lower alkalinity was monitored at the uasb an appropriate amount of sodium bicarbonate solution was added to ensure the normal operation of the uasb on 76th day on the contrary the ubes can self provide a steadily alkalinity level to maintain the anaerobic operation without extra alkaline substances addition it was worthy to note that during 141st to 146th day the values of vfa in uasb suddenly rose up as the sudden drop in temperature of the reaction system the ubes did not observed obviously shock of vfa during these day also indicated ubes had excellent impact resistance compared with uasb since 156th day the α value of ubes and uasb stabilized at 0 08 and 0 11 respectively khoufi et al 2015 had observed that the α value of the anaerobic reactor to be successfully operated needed to be less than 0 3 which proved that our reactors were stable during the part iii to part v the average effluent vfa alkalinity and α value of ubes at hrt of 48 h were 132 18 mg l 3245 240 mg l and 0 04 0 01 respectively which was all superior to uasb 208 13 mg l 2486 87 mg l and 0 08 0 01 under the stage r1 of hrt of 36 h vfa of both ubes and uasb were increased and average vfa were 206 31 mg l and 287 40 mg l respectively chelliapan et al 2011 reported that microorganisms in anaerobic reactor for treating pharmaceutical wastewater cannot withstand excessive organic loading and leads the reduction of organic removal efficiency interestingly although a decrease of alkalinity in ubes was found at hrt of 36 h the average alkalinity of ubes was still higher than the average alkalinity of uasb at hrt of 48 h which also demonstrated that ubes can withstand high cod loading rate when the hrt were shortened to 20 h vfa of uasb further accumulated average vfa increased from 239 36 mg l stage r2 to 632 87 mg l stage r1 it s worthy to be noted that as the increasingly of vfa and decreasingly of alkalinity led the average value of α in uasb dramatically increased to 0 37 0 05 which was much higher than 0 3 on the contrary effluent vfa of ubes showed a slightly upward trend and the alkalinity also showed slightly decreased trend and the average value of α was stable at about 0 13 0 03 this probably due to a small amount of electrode active bacteria which can effectively use vfa acetate as the substrate cui et al 2014 for current generation in the bes system thus ensuring a lower effluent vfa the vfa alkalinity and α values of the two reactors could not be restored to the level observed at part iii and part iv even the cod loading rate was reduced to the same value of part iii and part iv during the stage r2 the results indicating that hrt of 20 h was the limitation for the two reactors as the microbial activity was affected and degrade pollutants was burdensome under the high loading rate conditions however it is noted that the ubes with a superior condition to the uasb at the whole experimental operation as the bes module implantation 3 3 biogas and methane production biogas and methane production of ubes and uasb were shown in fig 4 the amount of biogas production at start up period was extremely low with average of 24 4 ml d and 15 3 ml d in ubes and uasb respectively the low production of methane in the ubes during the start up period was owing to the competition between the electrogenic and methanogenic bacteria at lower organic loading rate which the process of methanogenesis was inhibited vamshi krishna and venkata mohan 2016 the methanogenic rate of ubes was observed with an upward trend and more stable than the uasb with the acclimation of sludge and the further increase of loading rate the biogas and methane production in ubes and uasb were increased obviously since 111st day it was worth to note that the operation temperature of the two reactors was reduced to the ambient temperature of 25 3 c in 140th to 146th day the decrease of temperature caused uasb to be subjected to a certain impact and in a decrease in the biogas production which proved that shock temperature had a significant impact on methanogens hu et al 2017 jadhav and ghangrekar 2009 however the impact of temperature fluctuations is inhibited by the bes module as more diversity microbial community in the ubes it was observed that the biogas production and methane production of ubes were significantly higher than uasb under different hrt conditions the maximum biogas production of the two reactors was observed at 3526 ml d ubes and 2669 ml d uasb respectively it can be seen from fig 4 b that the highest average percentage of methane of uasb was observed at hrt of 48 h 71 6 4 1 with the shortening of hrt to 20 h the average percentage of methane decreased to 41 2 5 7 significantly the highest average percentage of methane of ubes was obtained at stage r2 77 6 1 9 and the average values during part ii to part v were 60 9 16 4 indicating the anaerobic digestion reaction in the ubes system was carried out thoroughly other researchers had reported similar results from the treatment of antibiotic wastewater hoffmann and drescher 2005 s study showed that more biogas could be produced by mixed reactors ng et al 2015 employed an anaerobic membrane bioreactor to treat pharmaceutical wastewater nearly 60 70 of methane was present in the biogas produced under steady state conditions from the above descriptions it was concluded that the best hrt for ubes to produce biogas was 36 h 3 4 comparison and analysis of performance based on a literature survey carried out on β lactams wastewater treatment the proposed method ubes in this study was compared with the other methods a listing has been made of the anaerobic biological treatment technologies in table 4 it s undoubted that anaerobic processes are more applicable for β lactams wastewater treatment zhou et al 2006 used a pilot scale anaerobic baffled reactor abr to treat ampicillin and aureomycin wastewater under hrt 60 h compared to this results the ubes achieved similar cod removal efficiency under shorter hrt conditions hrt 48 h oktem et al 2008 used a lab scale hybrid uasb to treat bacampicilline and sultampicilline tosylate wastewater achieved 83 cod removal efficiency at an organic loading rate olr of 4 kgcod m3 d however ubes achieved 89 cod removal efficiency under the same olr proved the outstanding performance of ubes it was worth noting that ubes achieved a better performance of cod removal than huang et al 2018 attained further proved the feasibility of treating β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater by ubes meantime it can be found in table 4 the accumulation of vfa in ubes was less than li et al 2019 and huang et al 2018 got under similar olr conditions and the lowest vfa concentration attained by chen et al 2011 was still higher than that of ubes these phenomena further demonstrated that ubes was better able to reduce the accumulation of vfa thus ensuring the normal operation higher alkalinity than the result of zhou et al 2006 also proved that ubes had a better condition for microorganisms to remove contaminants the average methane yield of the ubes under hrt 48 h with an average value of 0 31 0 07 l gcodremoved which was higher with the study reported by huang et al 2018 ng et al 2015 meng et al 2015 and shi et al 2014 moreover the average methane yield of the ubes at stage r2 was relatively consistent with the study reported by li et al 2019 who applied the pilot scale egsb for the treatment of cephalosporin wastewater these all indicated that ubes had good methane production 3 5 analysis of the relationship between methane production and vfa vfa is an important intermediate in the anaerobic process which mainly used for methanogens to form methane and high vfa accumulation has an inhibitory effect on methanogens gao et al 2019 jiang et al 2018 fig 5 shows the relationship between methane production and vfa in ubes and uasb it can be found that the change of vfa had a significant influence on methane production which can be expressed by mathematical fitting analysis it can be clearly found that with the increase of vfa the amount of methane production in ubes and uasb at hrt of 72 h all showed a rapidly downward trend which proved that excessive accumulation of vfa had a negative feedback effect on methanogens with the changes of hrts the relationship between methane production and vfa in ubes and uasb were exhibited a same variation trend at hrt of 48 h and 36 h it is interesting to observed that an increasingly vfa accumulation within a certain range appropriately had a positive promotion contribute to the methane production process of the methanogen moreover the increase of vfa in ubes with the range of 140 190 mg l at hrt of 36 h showed largest significant positive effect on the increase of methane production when switched hrt to 20 h the relationship between the methane production and vfa accumulation of the two reactors showed a significant decline the slope of the ubes fitting curve y 0 001x 3 0 789x 2 201 81x 14176 r2 0 955 was much flatter than the uasb fitting curve y 0 0002x 3 0 357x 2 230 37x 47968 r2 0 925 further demonstrated ubes was superior to the resistance for loading rate shock meanwhile a lower concentration of vfa in ubes reflected ubes could slow down the inhibition of vfa on methanogens these phenomena also indicated that properly hrt and well controlled vfa concentration were crucial to receive a favorable methane production performance 3 6 relationships between cod consumption and biogas production the relationships between biogas production qbiogas and cod consumption δcod under different hrts in the two reactors could be obtained through different functions such as the linear fitting quadratic polynomial fitting power equation fitting and exponential equation fitting as shown in fig 6 a series of formulas about the relationship between qbiogas and δcod were obtained as eq 2 which were more precise compared with the classical formula 1 1 q a v s 0 s e η 1000 t where q a is biogas production nm3 d v is effective volume m3 η is biogas yield m3 kgcod s 0 is influent cod mgcod l s e is effluent cod mgcod l t is hydraulic retention time d the general formulas for ubes and uasb under different hrts established as follows 2 h r t 72 h q b i o g a s a δ c o d b h r t 48 h q b i o g a s a δ c o d 2 b δ c o d c h r t 36 h r 1 q b i o g a s a e b δ c o d h r t 36 h r 2 q b i o g a s a δ c o d b h r t 20 h q b i o g a s a e b δ c o d where a b and c are the coefficients the relationships between qbiogas and δcod for ubes were 3 h r t 72 h q b i o g a s 0 162 δ c o d 186 91 r 2 0 975 h r t 48 h q b i o g a s 20 05 δ c o d 2 87 64 δ c o d 2797 6 r 2 0 231 h r t 36 h r

uasb showed a significant linear positive correlation between qbiogas and δcod under hrt of 72 h and the linear coefficient of ubes 0 162 was higher than the uasb 0 142 indicated ubes has higher biogas conversion efficiency and can promote the anaerobic biogas production when hrt was 48 h the fitting curve cannot well match r2 0 231 for ubes and r2 0 241 of uasb with the actual data of qbiogas and δcod but it could be concluded that ubes was kept at a more stable upward trend compared with uasb when hrt reduced to 36 h exponential function and power function were established for simulating the relationship between qbiogas and δcod under stage r1 and stage r2 respectively that of uasb showed a steady upward trend at stage r1 the coefficient of ubes 2597 2 was still higher than uasb 1554 1 even the fitting performance of ubes r2 0 741 was slightly worse than uasb r2 0 976 at stage r2 the coefficient of ubes model 2599 5 higher than the uasb 1734 6 also can support that ubes has higher cod treatment capacity and biogas production the stability of the relationship between qbiogas and δcod of the two reactors at hrt 20 h was obviously lower than her of 36 h and the corresponding coefficients of ubes and uasb were also significantly lower than the coefficients which observed under hrt of 36 h which indicated that lower hrt had a significant effect on cod removal and biogas production in both reactors 3 7 analysis of standard deviations and relative deviations standard deviations and relative deviations were applied to compare the different performance between ubes and uasb the formulas as follows 5 s d 1 n i 1 n x i μ 2 where s d is standard deviation x i is the values of samples μ represents the mean of x 1 to x n n is the number of samples 6 r d u 1 u 2 u 1 100 where r d is relative deviation u 1 and u 2 are effluent cod cod removal efficiency vfa alkalinity and biogas production in uasb and ubes respectively the results of sd and rd are shown in table 5 it can be clearly found that ubes had a more stable performance than uasb in cod removal and vfa under all hrt conditions although the sd of cod removal efficiency of ubes at hrt of 48 h was slightly higher than uasb the sd of effluent cod was less than uasb the reason of the difference between ubes and uasb about the alkalinity and biogas production was that alkalinity and biogas production in ubes continued to increase with the gradual stabilization of the operation conditions rd was used to evaluate the deviation of the ubes in effluent cod cod removal efficiency vfa alkalinity and biogas production from that of uasb under different conditions obviously rd between ubes and uasb in cod removal was larger under the stage r3 of hrt 72 h hrt 48 h and stage r1 of hrt 36 h proved that ubes had a superior cod removal than uasb and the maximum deviation was observed higher than 40 under low hrt conditions rd of vfa between ubes and uasb was larger than longer hrt which further confirmed the conclusion that the previously obtained ubes can effectively reduce the accumulation of vfa moreover the relatively large rd of biogas production proved that ubes had better biogas production than uasb 3 8 techno economic analysis a cost and benefit analysis are necessary for evaluating the potential of ubes in practical applications compared with uasb at one side the ubes can enhance the pollutants removal and biogas production however at other side the ubes need more external energy consumption and capital cost for the electrode module wang et al 2017 thus it is necessary to perform a techno economic analysis that takes both of the pollutant removal and the material cost into account the capital cost and operation cost of the ubes and uasb were calculated in the supplementary material section 1 table s1 showed that there were polynomial functions between the unit capital cost and cod loading rate lr as eq 7 and fig 7 a 7 u c a p u a s b 4 32 l r 2 51 77 l r 193 8 r 2 0 934 u c a p u b e s 4 63 l r 2 56 60 l r 217 0 r 2 0 983 where u c a p u a s b and u c a p u b e s represent the unit capital cost of uasb and ubes us kgcodremoved lr represents the cod loading rate kgcod m3 d the polynomial functions between the unit operation cost and cod loading rate lr as eq 8 and fig 7b 8 o p e u a s b 4 36 10 2 l r 2 0 346 l r 1 158 r 2 0 794 o p e u b e s 3 90 10 2 l r 2 0 318 l r 1 036 r 2 0 602 where o p e u a s b and o p e u b e s represent the unit capital cost of uasb and ubes us kgcodremoved the unit capital cost of ubes was higher than uasb under all the cod loading rate conditions due to the electrode module built in the ubes the unit capital cost difference between uasb and ubes was smaller as the increasingly cod loading rate fig 7 a indicating that ubes has higher capacity for treating the high load β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater for the unit operation cost ubes was observed much lower than the uasb under all the cod loading rate conditions there are several possible reasons for the lower unit operation cost in the ubes the higher amount of cod removed for unit reactor volume can reduce the unit pump heating and chemical consumption in ubes moreover the higher specific methane production in ubes means more energy can recover from the wastewater it is noted that the power consumption for the electrode module in ubes can be negligible as the power consumption for the electrode module only accounts 1 0 56 0 98 of the total unit operation cost in ubes from fig 7b we also observed that the lowest unit operation cost of uasb and ubes was observed about cod loading rate of 4 0 kgcod m3 d this result suggested that the economically optimal operation was cod loading rate hold at 4 0 kgcod m3 d for ubes and uabs the payback period for upgrading uasb to ubes by built in electrode module was list as eq 9 and fig 7c 9 p p u c a p u b e s u c a p u a s b o p e u a s b o p e u b e s q u b e s where p p represent the payback period d the results showed that ubes is profitable for β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater as the payback period was lower than 0 5 year with cod loading rate from 2 0 to 7 0 kgcod m3 d moreover a decreased trend as the increasing cod loading rate was also indicated ubes was superior to treat high loading rate wastewater 3 9 rbfnn model the radial basis function neural network rbfnn model was constructed to simulate and predict the effluent cod of ubes and uasb the rbfnn model was established by using the software spss17 0 taking several parameters into account influent cod vfa alkalinity and hrt the networks comprised four nodes in input layers undetermined nodes in hidden layer and an output node effluent cod the networks were trained by using the training data set 1st 196th days ubes and 1st 206th days uasb and then validated with the testing data set 197th 316th days ubes and 207th 316th days uasb the specific rbfnn model was calculated in the supplementary material section 2 the prediction performance of the model during the debugging and perfecting by adjusting node numbers were attained rbfnn architecture were 4 8 1 ubes and 4 10 1 uasb the relative error in training phase were 0 070 and 0 064 moreover in testing phase the values were 0 132 and 0 044 respectively for achieving an anticipated result the number of neurons in the hidden layer of different output layer were varied it can be seen in fig 8 a b the normalized importance for hrt alkalinity vfa and influent cod were 100 0 73 6 71 0 81 2 ubes and 77 7 72 8 57 2 100 uasb respectively which showed that the models for ubes and uasb could simulate the degree of influence of the respective variables during the operation time the experimental observed and model simulated the values of effluent cod for ubes and uasb during rbfnn training and testing were shown in fig 9 a b in training phase and testing phase there were fit in the trends between the simulated and the experimental data the simulation models built on the rbfnn theory were practical and feasible to simulate and predict the effluent cod in ubes and uasb which can be employed to predict the effluent quality of them 4 conclusion in this work a novel ubes reactor was set up for treating β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater which technical feasibility and long term operation performance were discussed to determine reasonable hrt parameters by comparison with uasb the conclusions were summarized as follows 1 it was feasible to use ubes for treating β lactams pharmaceutical wastewater which had better degradation performance on cod than uasb the optimal hrt of ubes was controlled at 48 h 2 membrane free electrode structure of ubes alleviated the accumulation of vfa slowed down the inhibition of vfa on methanogens and contributed to the improvement of biogas production 3 the techno economic analysis demonstrated ubes was profitable for pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and the optimal cod loading rate was 4 0 kgcod m3 d 4 the relationships between methane production and vfa as well as biogas production and cod consumption were analyzed respectively which proved a properly selected hrt and a well posed range vfa were important in order to receive a favorable biogas production 5 rbfnn model could fit well with the experimental data which can be employed to reflect and predict the operational performance of ubes under different conditions conflicts of interest we declare that we have no financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that can

18569,a biomolecular based monitoring approach for the assessment of water quality hazards and risks associated with cyanobacteria was developed and validated in drinking reservoirs in taiwan and the philippines the approach was based upon the measurement of gene abundances of toxigenic microcystis and cylindrospermopsis for cyanotoxins and for aesthetically offensive earthy musty odor compounds this was compared to conventional monitoring approaches which included cell enumeration by microscopy and toxin and odor compound analysis by instrumental analytical methods and immunoassays as appropriate for the metabolites the validation involved samples from ten major reservoirs on taiwan s main island nineteen reservoirs on the offshore islands and laguna de bay in the philippines the gene based approach was successfully validated statistically and compared to conventional widely utilized risk assessment schemes which have employed alert levels for toxic cyanobacteria in this case a new integrated scheme of response levels is proposed which incorporates odor metabolite hazards in addition to cyanotoxins and is based upon gene copy numbers to derive quantitative triggers the comprehensive scheme evaluated from these locations is considered to be more precise and efficient for both monitoring and as a risk assessment diagnostic tool given that it offers the capacity for analysis of the abundance of genes for cyanobacterial metabolites in large numbers of natural water samples in a significantly reduced period of time compared to the approaches of cell enumeration by microscopy or metabolite analytical techniques this approach is the first time both the hazard and risk for both odors and cyanotoxins from cyanobacteria have been considered together in a monitoring scheme and offers an improved means for determining the response levels in the risk assessment process for cyanobacteria and their metabolites in drinking water sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords response level cyanotoxins drinking water 2 methylisoborneol real time pcr risk 1 introduction excessive growth and blooms of cyanobacteria often cause significant problems for the water industry as many of these microorganisms are toxin or odor producers cyanotoxins can be classified according to their mode of action 1 microcystins and cylindrospermopsin are primarily hepatotoxins and 2 anatoxin and saxitoxins are neurotoxins sivonen 1996 in addition to these toxins the cyanobacterial metabolites such as trans 1 10 dimethyl trans 9 decalol geosmin and 2 methylisorboneol 2 mib are the two most commonly detected taste and odor t o compounds produced by cyanobacteria these compounds may cause offensive earthy and musty odors which are a significant issue for drinking water supplies butakova 2013 juttner and watson 2007 li et al 2012 interpreting and managing the risks associated with cyanobacteria in drinking water reservoirs has always been a challenge cyanobacterial growth is influenced by a combination of many environmental factors such as nutrient levels water temperature sunlight water movement and residence time merel et al 2013 modeling approaches have been developed to predict cyanobacterial growth however they are generally still too complicated and not precise enough yet to be implemented practically for early warning chorus and bartram 1999 ryding and rast 1989 taylor et al 2006 in practice assessing and managing the risks associated with the harmful cyanobacteria in source water typically have the following steps i regular visual inspection monitoring of chlorophyll a and cell counts if cyanobacteria are expected to occur ii sample collection for appropriate analysis to characterize the concentration of toxins and odor compounds iii reporting and assessment to determine appropriate response actions and iv management response and intervention ibelings et al 2015 this approach has been in widespread practice in many countries for over 25 years and was first outlined as a systematic framework by world health organization who chorus and bartram 1999 that approach incorporated hazard identification and assessment followed by recommended staged management actions in a framework called an alert levels framework alf the alf takes the form of a decision tree linked to a tiered system based upon escalating thresholds this system is defined by either numbers or biovolumes of cyanobacteria and or toxin concentrations representing an increasing human health hazard based upon toxicity the framework has proved robust and useful in responding to the hazards of cyanobacteria in many jurisdictions however it was developed using thresholds for toxicity hazard using monitoring technology available at that time in addition this approach and sequence of steps may take several days due to practical requirements for sample collection transportation followed by laboratory analysis interpretation and reporting this practice and approach may typically delay necessary response actions which can lead to problems for drinking water treatment operation public safety and assurance given that levels of cyanobacteria can change quite rapidly within a short time period a range of approaches to rapidly estimate the risk associated with cyanotoxins and t o compounds have been applied for source water management including quantification of chlorophyll a and or phycocyanin using on line fluoroprobes and taxonomic identification and cell enumeration with microscopes izydorczyk et al 2009 chang et al 2012 zamyadi et al 2016 the approach of using fluoroprobes provides almost real time results for cell numbers biovolume of cyanobacterial and algal groups however the method cannot provide species information for cyanobacteria and therefore does not provide a realistic estimation of risk levels for cyanotoxins and or t o compounds the more traditional approach of microscope based cell enumeration methods here denoted as the cell count based method provides information about potential toxin and t o compound producing cyanobacterial species and is a common practice in the water industry fan et al 2016 newcombe et al 2010 in applying the cell count based approach for risk estimation of cyanotoxins and t o compounds knowledge of the cell quotas the amount of toxin t o compound per cell for the targeted metabolites is required in advance so that the risk levels can be estimated for the corresponding cyanobacterial cell numbers from counts in relation to cyanotoxins in an early who guidance document the cell quota for microcystins in microcystis aeruginosa was proposed at 0 2 pg cell 1 chorus and bartram 1999 while a quota of 0 067 pg cell 1 has been proposed for cylindrospermopsin in cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in a more recent guidance manual newcombe et al 2010 it is well known that the cell quotas may change and be highly variable between cyanobacterial species and strains due to their stage in the growth cycle and environmental conditions van de waal et al 2014 a compilation of cell quotas from multiple laboratory experiments is provided in supplementary table s1 these range from 0 03 fg to 9 55 pg cell 1 for microcystin briand et al 2012 dai et al 2008 downing et al 2005 orr and jones 1998 sevilla et al 2010 19 fg to 1 91 ng cell 1 for cylindrospermopsin bácsi et al 2006 pierangelini et al 2015 14 2 to 107 4 fg cell 1 for 2 mib over the whole growth cycle of pseudanabaena galeata twncku13 chiu et al 2016 and 200 to 700 fg cell 1 for phormidium li et al 2012 for field monitoring data the average cell quotas reported range was 0 03 1 95 pg cell 1 for microcystin in missisquoi bay in us watzin et al 2006 the t o metabolites range is similarly broad with reports of 15 838 fg cell 1 for geosmin in myponga reservoir in australia tsao et al 2014 these highly variable cell quotas from both laboratory and field data indicate challenges in setting a truly representative cell quota for use as a surrogate for guideline values in addition to the wide ranges of cell quotas many studies have reported that there is no correlation found between the cyanobacterial cell numbers and the cyanotoxin concentration hitzfeld et al 2000 vaitomaa et al 2003 also making the application of the cell count based approach less reliable recently biomolecular methods such as quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr have been shown to successfully quantify the genes responsible for the production of microcystin mc cylindrospermospin cyn and 2 methyisoborneol 2 mib in reservoirs yen et al 2012 chiu et al 2016 in addition other detection methods such as the enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay elisa liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and gas chromatograph mass spectrometry gc ms are reliable quantitative techniques for the detection of cyanotoxins and t o compound concentrations bruno et al 2006 jemal 2000 zheng et al 2006 although the elisa lc ms and gc ms techniques are becoming more rapid and provide actual metabolite odor and toxin concentrations for comparison to operating guidelines or health alerts they can still be inaccessible to many water utility operators in addition they also are often costly and this results in operators choosing to run with a minimum number of samples at low frequency for both decision making and compliance some recent studies have attempted to develop the link between the levels of metabolites cyanotoxins and t o compounds and their producing genes srivastava et al 2012 savela et al 2014 yu et al 2014 lee et al 2015 and a number of correlations have been developed ha et al 2011 pimentel and giani 2013 ngwa et al 2014 otten et al 2015 supplementary table s2 summarizes the correlations developed for microcystins and mcya e cylindrospermopsins and pks cyrc geosmin and gsy1 and 2 mib and mibc these correlations between cyanobacterial metabolites and their producing genes allow for gene copies to be used as a potential indicator for level of metabolites furthermore given that a biomolecular based approach is able to assess large numbers of samples at multiple sites within a relatively short time frame 2 h chiu et al 2016 2017 the biomolecular based approach can be considered as an attractive method to collect larger volumes of data to assess the hazard associated with harmful cyanobacteria and their metabolites in reservoirs although the biomolecular based methods have been employed to detect toxin and t o compound producers in lakes reservoirs and fishponds furukawa et al 2006 rinta kanto et al 2009 hua et al 2011 tsao et al 2014 chiu et al 2016 2017 crawford et al 2017 lee et al 2018 the results have been limited to correlation development for genes and toxins odor compounds comparison with chlorophyll a based methods for toxin levels and determination of separation efficiency for cells no previous studies have applied the biomolecular based monitoring method as a decision tool for risk management of cyanotoxins and t o compounds in drinking water sources therefore the aim of this study was to develop and validate a biomolecular based monitoring approach as a diagnostic tool and as an alternative to cell count based approaches this approach is anticipated to aid in making decision thresholds in the hazard and risk assessment associated with cyanobacterial toxins and t o compounds in drinking water reservoirs the approach was evaluated and validated in drinking water reservoirs in both taiwan and the philippines that have significant problems with the occurrence of toxigenic and t o producing cyanobacteria the effectiveness of this approach was examined with respect to the opportunity to provide a major advance to achieve increased speed and efficiency to characterize cyanobacterial hazards relative to the more conventional and time consuming cell count based approaches in addition the approach developed here is the first time that both the hazard and risk for both t o and toxins from cyanobacteria have been considered together in a monitoring scheme and offers an improved means for determining the response levels in the risk assessment process for cyanobacteria and their metabolites in drinking water sources the term response levels rls is used here to avoid any conflict with the widely accepted term for the system of alert levels which are in widespread usage exclusively for cyanotoxin public health risk assessment and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling water samples were collected from reservoirs on taiwan main island 10 reservoirs taiwan s two offshore islands 19 reservoirs and in the philippines 1 lake these reservoirs are important sources of drinking water which have been reports of cyanotoxins or t o problems or with a high potential for cyanobacterial blooms based upon the phosphorus levels in reservoirs a total of 518 518 and 275 samples were collected for mc cyn and 2 mib and the associated cyanobacteria responsible for producing them respectively during the period 2012 to 2016 from the 29 reservoirs details of the locations for the sampling of the 29 reservoirs in taiwan were reported in chiu et al 2016 2017 in addition 36 samples were collected from laguna de bay in the philippines during the period of august 18 22 2016 laguna de bay in the philippines is the largest inland water resource and is a source of domestic water supply for the western part of metro manila and is known to have many cyanobacterial blooms baldia et al 2003 downing et al 2001 2 2 cell enumeration the species and numbers of cyanobacterial cells were identified and counted by microscopy bx 51 olympus japan with a s52 sedgwick rafter chamber graticules ltd uk following the procedures of standard method 10200f apha et al 1998 immediately after sampling a lugol s solution 1 by volume was added to the samples for preservation before cell enumeration for the enumeration 1 ml of sample was first added to the sedgwick rafter chamber settled for 30 min and counted under the microscope with a magnification of 400 chiu et al 2017 for measurement of filamentous c raciborskii 30 filaments were initially counted to obtain the average cell number per unit length of c raciborskii trichomes then the cell concentrations were determined based upon the total lengths of the filaments measured in the samples and the cell numbers per unit trichome marbun et al 2012 2 3 measurement of genes regulating toxins t o metabolites of cyanobacteria a qpcr method was used to quantify the genes targeted in the samples details about sample treatment for dna extraction primer and probe sets used for targeted genes and procedures for quantification of dna have been reported in chiu et al 2016 2017 the genes targeted in this study included microcystis 16s rrna gene wilson et al 2000 microcystin producing mcyb genes yen et al 2006 cylindrospermopsis rpoc1 gene schembri et al 2001 cylindrospermopsin producing pks genes rasmussen et al 2008 and the 2 mib producing mibc gene chiu et al 2016 although the mcyb and pks genes only represent potentially toxigenic microcystis spp and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii aphanizomenon ovalisporum raphidiopsis curvata anabaena bergii and oscillatoria sp respectively microcystis spp and c raciborskii have been found to be the major toxin producing species in the studied reservoirs chiu et al 2017 a portable qpcr device smart cycler cepheid ca was used to carry out the on site rapid assessment along with taqman qpcr mixtures which have been reported in chiu et al 2016 2017 the qpcr protocols for the 5 genes includes pre incubation at 95 c a 40 cycle denaturation at 95 c and an annealing extension at 60 c at the end of the extension the fluorescence intensity was recorded at 519 nm for fam 561 nm for cy3 665 nm for cy5 and 615 nm for texas red respectively the threshold cycles ct values and the specificity analysis were conducted using smart cycler software cepheid ca hein et al 2001 marbun et al 2012 whelan et al 2003 2 4 quantification of cyanotoxins enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa based upon the specificity between antibody and antigen engvall and perlmann 1971 was used for the detection of the two cyanotoxins prior to the analysis water samples were sonicated at 250 kw for 60 min digital sonifier branson ultrasonic co ct usa to rupture the cells and release intracellular toxins a subsample of 50 μl from the sonicated samples was used for the assay following the procedures prescribed by the manufacturers commercial immunoassay kits were used in this study pn 520012 for microcystins and pn 522011for cylindrospermopsin both from abraxis llc pennsylvania usa a micro plate spectrophotometer xmark bio rad ca and a multiskan fc thermo scientific finland were coupled with a microplate manager ver 6 software bio rad ca for the measurement 2 5 analysis of t o compounds the t o compounds geosmin and 2 mib were analyzed by the standard method recommended by the taiwan epa niea w537 51b the samples were first filtered for the separation of the total cell bound plus dissolved phase and dissolved portions of 2 mib chiu et al 2016 briefly solid phase micro extraction spme was used for the extraction of the compounds from the samples which were subsequently analyzed with a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer gc ms 6890 5973 agilent usa detailed information about the spme fiber and experimental conditions for the analysis has been reported in lin et al 2002 2003 and chiu et al 2016 2 6 risk assessment risk levels for the development and occurrence of cyanotoxins and t o compounds in reservoirs were assessed based upon the collection of a range of water quality data relevant to cyanobacterial metabolites including cell numbers of toxigenic microcystis spp and cylindrospermopsis spp along with concentrations of toxins microcystins mcs and cylindrospermopsins cyns and of odor metabolites 2 mib and geosmin geosmin saxitoxins and their producers were not included in this analysis because their concentrations in the samples collected were either below detection limits or were very low following the risk levels suggested by who chorus and bartram 1999 and the water quality research association wqra guidance document newcombe et al 2010 the risk was categorized into three levels described below depending upon the concentrations of cyanobacterial cells measured with microscope and qpcr and the concentrations of cyanotoxins and 2 mib in the drinking water guidelines proposed by different international organizations and agencies the suggested values were 5000 cells ml for microcystis chorus and bartram 1999 and 15 000 cells ml for cylindrospermopsis newcombe et al 2010 to 1 μ g l of microcystin and cylindrospermopsin and 10 ng l for 2 mib japan mhlw 2015 the reservoirs were assigned with specific numerical values for each item detected by comparing the measured concentration in the samples with the corresponding gv for cyanobacterial cells or metabolites 2 7 statistical analysis three separate statistical analyses of the field data sets were required as part of developing and proving an alternative quantitative threshold system for use in a response levels framework firstly to demonstrate the feasibility of using cell gene abundances as indicator for the levels of toxins and odor compounds binary logistic regression was used to correlate cell gene abundances of toxin and odor producers with the concentrations of corresponding cyanotoxins and odor compounds in this analysis each datum was assigned either 0 or 1 depending upon whether it exceeded its proposed threshold concentration level per event the parameters in this logistic regression model were estimated by fitting the generalized linear models in r package mass r 3 4 4 r core team 2018 the resulting s curved illustrates the event probability versus cell numbers or gene copies which provides reference points for setting response level corresponding cell gene concentration additionally the goodness of fit test for logistic regression was evaluated with hosmer lemeshow test peng et al 2002 miecznikowski et al 2013 using package generalhoslem in r jay 2016 secondly to determine a representative value for cell gene quota we assessed the distribution of monitoring data fitted with a lognormal distribution by the distribution fitting tool from matlab version r2016a the mathworks inc usa the results are presented as a probability plot with a standardized value in percentile which provided a measure for setting guideline values of cell gene quotas the goodness of fit test for lognormal distribution was evaluated with the pearson shapiro wilk and anderson darling normality tests using the nortest package in r gross et al 2015 thirdly concordance assessment was used to examine the performance of the modified response level framework by testing the consistency of standard methods such as elisa for toxins and gc ms for odor compounds and alternative methods such as microscope cell numbers and qpcr gene copies then the cohen s kappa for binomial variables was calculated using excel to determine the strength of agreement followed by the statistic procedure kwiecien et al 2011 cohen s kappa statistic gives 6 ranks for strength of agreement poor slight fair moderate substantial and almost perfect which the values accordingly are 0 0 2 0 21 0 4 0 41 0 6 0 61 0 8 0 81 1 of which substantial agreement may be widely accepted and considered as an alternative method for the golden method watson and petrie 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlations between mc cyn 2mib and cell gene abundances although correlations between metabolite levels and corresponding producing gene abundances have been reported based on field samples for mcs cyn and 2 mib yu et al 2014 lee et al 2018 chiu et al 2016 2017 to be applied in response levels the cell gene abundances in relation to any particular threshold metabolite concentrations need to be identified first here the binary logistic regression is applied to determine how well cell gene abundances correlate to particular levels i e guideline values of metabolites the proportions and numbers of samples above detection limits for all sampling data set are shown in supplementary table s3 these samples from cell enumeration and qpcr methods were applied in the logistic regression where each sample is classified into value of 1 or 0 depending upon whether its level of metabolites is equal to or greater than certain concentrations note that the levels of metabolites used in the analysis i e 1 μg l for mc and cyn and 10 ng l for 2 mib were associated with other widely accepted alfs or drinking water quality standards chorus and bartram 1999 newcombe et al 2010 japan mhlw 2015 the s shaped curves in supplementary fig s1 illustrate the increasing probability for trigger level exceedance events to occur for increasing abundance of cell numbers and genes the predictive strength of each logistic model is examined by the hosmer lemeshow goodness of fit test to determine how well the data fits the models supplementary table s3 shows that all the cell gene quota models cannot be rejected for the null hypothesis of a good fit model p value 0 05 suggesting that using the cell gene quotas developed here for particular levels of threshold values in rls is reasonable although the logistic regression model may not be able to provide a high level of accuracy for prediction of the probability for each threshold in terms of cell numbers gene copies it is very useful when the values were incorporated into the development of a management strategy for example in the guidance framework of wqra newcombe et al 2010 the cell number thresholds of 6500 cells ml microcystis and 10 000 cells ml cylindrospermopsis were set for mc 1 3 μg l and cyn 1 0 μg l respectively these cell numbers represent 10 and 50 of probability to exceed the response level thresholds for mc and cyn respectively in supplementary fig s1 similarly in a study from single lake in china su et al 2015 the quantile regression between planktothrix sp biomass and total 2 mib concentration illustrates cell abundance at different probabilities for 2 mib reaching the threshold level of 15 ng l to be 16 50 and 400 cells ml at 10 50 and 90 respectively therefore it is considered that 10 probability would be an appropriate reference level to achieve a suitable degree of certainty for responding to the perceived hazard in source waters similarly for this reference level the mc thresholds of 0 3 1 0 and 10 μg l are represented by 630 6 500 and 100 000 cells ml or 60 250 and 6000 gene copies g c ml supplementary table s3 illustrates the values for the probability of exceedance of response trigger levels with regards to cell numbers and gene copies 3 2 cell and gene quota in log normal distribution the alert levels als recommended in the two widely used guidance documents are 0 3 1 and 10 μg l for mc for the defined levels of vigilance 1 and 2 respectively chorus and bartram 1999 newcombe et al 2010 newcombe et al 2010 also applied these same thresholds for cyn i e 0 3 1 and 10 μg l for levels 1 2 and 3 respectively note that the three levels in chorus and bartram 1999 i e vigilance 1 and 2 are equivalent to levels 1 3 in newcombe et al 2010 given that the guideline value for 2 mib is set at 10 ng l japan mhlw 2015 the response levels 1 2 and 3 used here for this odor compound are set at 3 10 and 100 ng l respectively these published als and our response levels were linked with cell concentrations based upon cell quotas of the toxins odor compounds for typical nuisance harmful cyanobacteria although some field studies have reported level of metabolites with cell count numbers briand et al 2012 dai et al 2008 downing et al 2005 orr and jones 1998 rasmussen et al 2008 watzin et al 2006 the results showed that diverse ranges of cqs were obtained and absence in the literature of a well defined span of cell quotas for the studied toxins odor compounds in natural system provides challenges for setting response levels the toxin and odor levels in this study together with cell gene abundance collected from 29 reservoirs over 4 years were converted into cell gene quotas for which the toxin or 2 mib concentrations were divided by the corresponding cell numbers or gene copies measured for the same samples the c gqs data were tested to examine the fit with log normal distribution as shown in fig 1 the data fits to linear line under a log probability plots the fit of normal distributions in the log scale were tested by the anderson darling test and the pearson chi square normality test in r 3 4 4 both tests hold for the null hypothesis of normal distribution for each quota set while the p value less than the 5 significance level means that the null hypothesis will be rejected table 1 lists the c gqs at different percentiles means and standard deviations for microcystins cylindrospermopsin and 2 mib based on the field data interpreted with log normal distribution model in this study furukawa et al 2006 rinta kanto et al 2009 and ha et al 2011 have analyzed samples collected from natural waters in japan and usa and obtained mc gene quota these data sets which included 12 samples from lake erie in usa measured for mcyd rinta kanto et al 2009 and 4 samples from lake kitaura and kasumigaura furukawa et al 2006 and 9 samples from a fishpond ha et al 2011 in japan analyzed for mcya were combined with our data of 122 samples from 29 taiwanese reservoirs and laguna de bay from the philippines analyzed for mcyb fig 2 demonstrates clearly that the combined gene quota set can still fit a log normal distribution this analysis passed the pearson shapiro wilk and anderson darling normality tests with p values equal to 0 78 0 07 and 0 09 respectively the mean and the range of mean standard deviation were 0 66 and 0 06 7 15 pg g c respectively which is similar to that of the original distribution 0 68 and 0 11 4 22 pg g c respectively although with a larger standard deviation this is because the data published from other studies tended to report only extreme values i e maximum and minimum values 3 3 cell and gene based response levels for metabolites it is possible to compare the two methods for their values at the same levels as both the logistic regression method and log normal distribution provide probabilities for gene cell quota for specific toxin odor compound level in other words a comparison can be made for the estimates of the cell gene abundances that are likely to occur for the same probability of exceedance of a threshold by these two approaches for example a concentration of mc lr 1 μg l will be estimated to be associated with gene copy abundances of 145 and 250 g c ml from log normal distribution and logistic regression methods respectively a similar trend was also found for all other combinations of toxin odor compound and cell gene quotas studied suggesting that the results obtained from the log normal distribution method is more conservative than from the logistic regression method this is due to the fact that for each toxin odor compound level lower cell gene number was determined using the log normal distribution method therefore the parameters extracted from the log normal distribution models are used to determine the cell gene based response levels currently the water quality guideline values for mc and cyn can be represented by the corresponding cell numbers of microcystis and cylindrospermopsis for example 1 μg l of mc and cyn is approximately equivalent to 5000 cells ml 1 and 13 000 cells ml 1 respectively as proposed by who chorus and bartram 1999 and wqra newcombe et al 2010 respectively therefore the derived cell quotas are 0 2 pg cell 1 for microcystis sp and 0 067 pg cell 1 for cylindrospermopsis sp corresponding to 80th and 60th percentiles respectively when compared with the log normal distribution model developed in this study fig 1 the cell quotas corresponding to 80th and 60th percentiles illustrated that 20 and 40 of the events may not be captured based upon the current field data as listed in table 1 higher cell quotas lead to larger percentiles and therefore lower cell numbers and gene copies for the same targeted toxin odor compound level to be more conservative in risk management for cyanobacteria a 90th percentile based cell quota may be a more suitable basis for environmental monitoring barnett and o hagan 1997 however the determination and selection of the desired percentile may be water resource dependent for example for a supplemental water supply reservoir a lower percentile of quota may be acceptable for setting response levels table 2 lists the c gqs for mc cyn and 2 mib at three rls based on the 90th percentiles cell gene quotas obtained from the log normal distribution model as shown in the table the toxin odor compound concentration at each rl may be transferred to the abundance of cell numbers or corresponding producing genes the cell numbers and gene abundances provided may thus serve as references for the determination of rls in source water for different toxins odor compounds and based upon the response level appropriate management actions may be triggered by water resource management agencies and water utilities as suggested in who chorus and bartram 1999 and wqra newcombe et al 2010 3 4 analysis of data and model agreement the agreement between the models and data were further evaluated using concordance assessment watson and petrie 2010 to evaluate if the proposed alternative rls were reasonable this analysis was used to determine whether consistent agreement can be achieved between the data and model for each of the c gqs determined at three different percentiles 50 75 and 90 percentiles which can be then selected for appropriate application in different source water management scenarios based upon the database of gene cell abundance and toxin and odor compound concentrations collected over 2012 2016 in this study the alternative rls table 2 built upon by cell gene methods can be examined through concordance assessment since the rls considered cell and gene quantity to represent the level of metabolites the metabolite concentrations monitored and analyzed with elisa for toxins or gc ms for 2 mib were used as standards in the assessment while the cell and gene quantity obtained by microscopy and qpcr analysis served as alternatives in the assessment each data set was analyzed for different rls according to its cell or gene abundances for example in one of the data sets the levels of mcyb and mc are 200 g c ml and 1 8 μg l respectively if we consider the rls with 90th percentile gq this datum point belongs to rl 2 i e mc 1 μg l in which case the gene level should be more than 145 g c ml table 2 there are four potential cases i e positive positive false negative false positive and negative negative by which in this first case both the standard mc concentration and the alternative gene abundance are greater than the rl for both mcyb and mc this leads to positive positive result called presence for both standard and alternative on the other hand if for another set of data mcyb is 100 g c ml and mc level is 1 8 μg l it will be a false negative as the standard is positive while the alternative is negative for false positive cases the metabolite concentrations are lower than the rls while their cells or gene abundances are higher than the rls the last case is negative negative in which both metabolites concentrations and cell gene abundance are lower than the rls it is noted that higher ratios of positive positive and negative negative cases in all the data assessed represent better agreement between the standards and alternatives fig 3 and supplementary fig s2 show the distributions of the data in the four cases for both cell enumeration and gene measurement in the figures the standards logarithmic values of toxin concentrations measured relative to those at rl2 mc 1 μg l and cyn 0 7 μg l were plotted against the alternative logarithmic values of gene cell abundance measured relative to those at rl2 microcystis 2800 cells ml cylindrospermopsis 1130 cells ml mcyb 145 g c ml and pks 20 g c ml the figures clearly show that gene measurement data are better than cell enumeration ones higher numbers of positive positive in the figures mcyb 37 microcystis cells 36 and negative negative mcyb 84 microcystis cells 55 but no false negative cases were found for mcyb and pks gene based method if compared to the cell enumeration based method for microcystis and cylindrospermopsis table 3 summarizes the results for the concordance assessment for the toxins and odor compounds investigated the results show that in general better agreement higher cohen s kappa value are obtained in the vigilance and response level 1 compared to the response level 2 this is due to the fact that kappa value is related to the proportion of cases categorized as positive by standard method watson and petrie 2010 for example only 3 values of 518 of the monitoring data for cyn exceeded the concentration of 7 μg l and this low prevalence 0 005 resulted in a low kappa value for mc the agreement with the gene based rls was better than those based upon cell counts although the data for c gqs at 50th percentiles showed the highest level of agreement those for gqs at the 90th percentiles are also in good agreement given that cohen s kappa of 0 61 0 80 and 0 41 0 6 indicates substantial agreement and moderate agreement respectively kwiecien et al 2011 for the cases of cyn although agreement was also found for rls 1 and 2 at rl3 the data for cyn and cells genes cannot be considered to be in good agreement this is because only three monitoring data points had concentrations of 7 μg l cyn leading to the disagreement of the standards and alternatives for 2 mib the analysis was made between the gene abundances and total cell bound odor compound levels theoretically 2 mib genes are present in 2 mib producing cyanobacteria chiu et al 2016 and therefore better correlations would be expected between the genes and cell bound 2 mib if compared to those for total 2 mib cell bound dissolved indeed as shown in table 3 better agreement is found for the data between the genes and cell bound 2 mib for both rls 1 and 2 the agreement between 2 mib gene abundance and 2 mib concentration was however less strong for rl3 this is due to the lower prevalence of data with high 2 mib concentrations where the number of samples with exceedance of rl3 i e 2 mib concentrations 100 ng l occurred on only 21 occasions prevalence 0 07 which was far fewer than those for samples 100 ng l this is similar to the circumstance discussed for cyn in this study both with very limited data at higher concentration range also shown in table 3 for almost all the cases for mc the gene based rls were in better agreement with the metabolite concentrations than those based on cell numbers in the cases of cyn the gene based rls are in similar degrees of agreement with those based upon cell numbers detection of toxin and odor compound producing genes have become more and more popular pacheco et al 2016 compared to the traditional labor intensive and time consuming cell enumeration methods biomolecular detection method offers a more rapid and precise method to quantify the potential for the occurrence of toxins and odor compounds in the water chiu et al 2016 2017 in addition cell enumeration cannot differentiate toxigenic and non toxigenic cells leading to inherent uncertainty in the estimation of the potential for the population to produce toxins and or odors the gene based approach as proposed in this study and in our view provides a more accurate estimation of the levels of cyanobacterial metabolites and more reliable reference for setting the response levels for the potential hazards from cyanobacteria and metabolites in drinking water reservoirs 3 5 application of the gene based rls model to laguna de bay philippines the response level model proposed in this study was also applied and evaluated using the field data collected from laguna de bay in manila philippines during august 18 22 2016 laguna de bay the second largest lake in south eastern asia with an area of 900 km2 is well known to have cyanobacterial blooms and odor problems thirty six samples were collected in a near uniform pattern distributed across the entire lake the samples were analyzed using qpcr for the mcyb pks and mibc genes by elisa for mcs and cyns and by gc ms for 2 mib following a similar approach for the evaluation of agreement reported above a dataset of 108 values for the three sets of toxins odor compounds were assessed in concordance with the prescribed analysis given above this was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed rls with the 90th percentile for gqs table 4 shows the results of this analysis the cohen s kappa of 0 6 suggests substantial strength of agreement between the toxin odor compound concentrations and gene abundances as indicated in the table all 33 samples with metabolite concentration greater than the rls were all detected with gene abundances greater than the corresponding rl indicating positive positive results all of the corresponding gene abundances were also measured at lower than rl1 for samples with metabolite concentrations lower than rl1 this represents negative negative cases in 22 of the 108 data points the measured gene abundance which exceeded the rl1 threshold however metabolite concentrations were lower than the rl1 threshold which was considered a false positive result for the assessment of hazard and management of cyanobacteria in water sources an unsatisfactory situation occurs when either toxin or odor compound is present in the water and the analytical methods used do not detect them leading to false negatives in the analysis of this dataset none of the data values fell into this category further considering both the degree of agreement between the standard and alternative values and the high percentage of positive positive results and no negative positive results the proposed gene based approach for assessing compliance with response levels is quite satisfactory for the monitoring of cyanobacterial hazards in laguna de bay 4 conclusions the robustness of the gene based methodology approach as an effective diagnostic tool for risk level determination for harmful cyanobacteria was evaluated using the data collected from 30 drinking water reservoirs lakes in taiwan and philippines either a logistic regression or log normal distribution model was able to adequately describe the relationships between the cell numbers gene copies or c gqs of microcystis cylindrospermopsis mcs cyn and 2 mib and their corresponding probability of exceeding rl thresholds the c gqs obtained were able to be used as references for rls under different risk levels for toxins and 2 mib episodes concordance assessment was further used to evaluate the agreements between the proposed gene based approach and toxin and 2 mib concentrations relative to the more conventional and time consuming cell count based approach the gene based approach has been shown to have a more accurate estimation of the occurrence of the selected toxins and 2 mib in the 29 reservoirs in taiwan and has been validated in laguna de bay in the philippines although the gene based approach reflects more specifically the targeted metabolites it needs information on the abundance of producing genes and therefore biomolecular instrumentation capability and training are required in addition as the method is based on dna measurement expression of toxin odor compounds producing genes may be dependent upon cyanobacterial species and growth phases and environmental conditions therefore long term monitoring at lakes reservoirs of interest may help to better understand the toxin odor compound producing risks for the conventional approach based upon cell enumeration only a microscope and professionals with experience of cyanobacteria taxonomy is required while the conventional approach has been widely applied in many countries the bio molecular method which has become more accessible recently has the potential to be widely used in research communities and water management agencies in addition cell enumeration cannot differentiate between toxigenic and non toxigenic cells leading to more uncertainties of the toxigenic producing potential the biomolecular based approach as proposed in this study appears to provide more accurate estimation of the metabolite producing cyanobacteria thus serving as a more reliable reference for setting the response levels for cyanobacteria and metabolites in drinking water

18569,a biomolecular based monitoring approach for the assessment of water quality hazards and risks associated with cyanobacteria was developed and validated in drinking reservoirs in taiwan and the philippines the approach was based upon the measurement of gene abundances of toxigenic microcystis and cylindrospermopsis for cyanotoxins and for aesthetically offensive earthy musty odor compounds this was compared to conventional monitoring approaches which included cell enumeration by microscopy and toxin and odor compound analysis by instrumental analytical methods and immunoassays as appropriate for the metabolites the validation involved samples from ten major reservoirs on taiwan s main island nineteen reservoirs on the offshore islands and laguna de bay in the philippines the gene based approach was successfully validated statistically and compared to conventional widely utilized risk assessment schemes which have employed alert levels for toxic cyanobacteria in this case a new integrated scheme of response levels is proposed which incorporates odor metabolite hazards in addition to cyanotoxins and is based upon gene copy numbers to derive quantitative triggers the comprehensive scheme evaluated from these locations is considered to be more precise and efficient for both monitoring and as a risk assessment diagnostic tool given that it offers the capacity for analysis of the abundance of genes for cyanobacterial metabolites in large numbers of natural water samples in a significantly reduced period of time compared to the approaches of cell enumeration by microscopy or metabolite analytical techniques this approach is the first time both the hazard and risk for both odors and cyanotoxins from cyanobacteria have been considered together in a monitoring scheme and offers an improved means for determining the response levels in the risk assessment process for cyanobacteria and their metabolites in drinking water sources graphical abstract image 1 keywords response level cyanotoxins drinking water 2 methylisoborneol real time pcr risk 1 introduction excessive growth and blooms of cyanobacteria often cause significant problems for the water industry as many of these microorganisms are toxin or odor producers cyanotoxins can be classified according to their mode of action 1 microcystins and cylindrospermopsin are primarily hepatotoxins and 2 anatoxin and saxitoxins are neurotoxins sivonen 1996 in addition to these toxins the cyanobacterial metabolites such as trans 1 10 dimethyl trans 9 decalol geosmin and 2 methylisorboneol 2 mib are the two most commonly detected taste and odor t o compounds produced by cyanobacteria these compounds may cause offensive earthy and musty odors which are a significant issue for drinking water supplies butakova 2013 juttner and watson 2007 li et al 2012 interpreting and managing the risks associated with cyanobacteria in drinking water reservoirs has always been a challenge cyanobacterial growth is influenced by a combination of many environmental factors such as nutrient levels water temperature sunlight water movement and residence time merel et al 2013 modeling approaches have been developed to predict cyanobacterial growth however they are generally still too complicated and not precise enough yet to be implemented practically for early warning chorus and bartram 1999 ryding and rast 1989 taylor et al 2006 in practice assessing and managing the risks associated with the harmful cyanobacteria in source water typically have the following steps i regular visual inspection monitoring of chlorophyll a and cell counts if cyanobacteria are expected to occur ii sample collection for appropriate analysis to characterize the concentration of toxins and odor compounds iii reporting and assessment to determine appropriate response actions and iv management response and intervention ibelings et al 2015 this approach has been in widespread practice in many countries for over 25 years and was first outlined as a systematic framework by world health organization who chorus and bartram 1999 that approach incorporated hazard identification and assessment followed by recommended staged management actions in a framework called an alert levels framework alf the alf takes the form of a decision tree linked to a tiered system based upon escalating thresholds this system is defined by either numbers or biovolumes of cyanobacteria and or toxin concentrations representing an increasing human health hazard based upon toxicity the framework has proved robust and useful in responding to the hazards of cyanobacteria in many jurisdictions however it was developed using thresholds for toxicity hazard using monitoring technology available at that time in addition this approach and sequence of steps may take several days due to practical requirements for sample collection transportation followed by laboratory analysis interpretation and reporting this practice and approach may typically delay necessary response actions which can lead to problems for drinking water treatment operation public safety and assurance given that levels of cyanobacteria can change quite rapidly within a short time period a range of approaches to rapidly estimate the risk associated with cyanotoxins and t o compounds have been applied for source water management including quantification of chlorophyll a and or phycocyanin using on line fluoroprobes and taxonomic identification and cell enumeration with microscopes izydorczyk et al 2009 chang et al 2012 zamyadi et al 2016 the approach of using fluoroprobes provides almost real time results for cell numbers biovolume of cyanobacterial and algal groups however the method cannot provide species information for cyanobacteria and therefore does not provide a realistic estimation of risk levels for cyanotoxins and or t o compounds the more traditional approach of microscope based cell enumeration methods here denoted as the cell count based method provides information about potential toxin and t o compound producing cyanobacterial species and is a common practice in the water industry fan et al 2016 newcombe et al 2010 in applying the cell count based approach for risk estimation of cyanotoxins and t o compounds knowledge of the cell quotas the amount of toxin t o compound per cell for the targeted metabolites is required in advance so that the risk levels can be estimated for the corresponding cyanobacterial cell numbers from counts in relation to cyanotoxins in an early who guidance document the cell quota for microcystins in microcystis aeruginosa was proposed at 0 2 pg cell 1 chorus and bartram 1999 while a quota of 0 067 pg cell 1 has been proposed for cylindrospermopsin in cylindrospermopsis raciborskii in a more recent guidance manual newcombe et al 2010 it is well known that the cell quotas may change and be highly variable between cyanobacterial species and strains due to their stage in the growth cycle and environmental conditions van de waal et al 2014 a compilation of cell quotas from multiple laboratory experiments is provided in supplementary table s1 these range from 0 03 fg to 9 55 pg cell 1 for microcystin briand et al 2012 dai et al 2008 downing et al 2005 orr and jones 1998 sevilla et al 2010 19 fg to 1 91 ng cell 1 for cylindrospermopsin bácsi et al 2006 pierangelini et al 2015 14 2 to 107 4 fg cell 1 for 2 mib over the whole growth cycle of pseudanabaena galeata twncku13 chiu et al 2016 and 200 to 700 fg cell 1 for phormidium li et al 2012 for field monitoring data the average cell quotas reported range was 0 03 1 95 pg cell 1 for microcystin in missisquoi bay in us watzin et al 2006 the t o metabolites range is similarly broad with reports of 15 838 fg cell 1 for geosmin in myponga reservoir in australia tsao et al 2014 these highly variable cell quotas from both laboratory and field data indicate challenges in setting a truly representative cell quota for use as a surrogate for guideline values in addition to the wide ranges of cell quotas many studies have reported that there is no correlation found between the cyanobacterial cell numbers and the cyanotoxin concentration hitzfeld et al 2000 vaitomaa et al 2003 also making the application of the cell count based approach less reliable recently biomolecular methods such as quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction qpcr have been shown to successfully quantify the genes responsible for the production of microcystin mc cylindrospermospin cyn and 2 methyisoborneol 2 mib in reservoirs yen et al 2012 chiu et al 2016 in addition other detection methods such as the enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay elisa liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms and gas chromatograph mass spectrometry gc ms are reliable quantitative techniques for the detection of cyanotoxins and t o compound concentrations bruno et al 2006 jemal 2000 zheng et al 2006 although the elisa lc ms and gc ms techniques are becoming more rapid and provide actual metabolite odor and toxin concentrations for comparison to operating guidelines or health alerts they can still be inaccessible to many water utility operators in addition they also are often costly and this results in operators choosing to run with a minimum number of samples at low frequency for both decision making and compliance some recent studies have attempted to develop the link between the levels of metabolites cyanotoxins and t o compounds and their producing genes srivastava et al 2012 savela et al 2014 yu et al 2014 lee et al 2015 and a number of correlations have been developed ha et al 2011 pimentel and giani 2013 ngwa et al 2014 otten et al 2015 supplementary table s2 summarizes the correlations developed for microcystins and mcya e cylindrospermopsins and pks cyrc geosmin and gsy1 and 2 mib and mibc these correlations between cyanobacterial metabolites and their producing genes allow for gene copies to be used as a potential indicator for level of metabolites furthermore given that a biomolecular based approach is able to assess large numbers of samples at multiple sites within a relatively short time frame 2 h chiu et al 2016 2017 the biomolecular based approach can be considered as an attractive method to collect larger volumes of data to assess the hazard associated with harmful cyanobacteria and their metabolites in reservoirs although the biomolecular based methods have been employed to detect toxin and t o compound producers in lakes reservoirs and fishponds furukawa et al 2006 rinta kanto et al 2009 hua et al 2011 tsao et al 2014 chiu et al 2016 2017 crawford et al 2017 lee et al 2018 the results have been limited to correlation development for genes and toxins odor compounds comparison with chlorophyll a based methods for toxin levels and determination of separation efficiency for cells no previous studies have applied the biomolecular based monitoring method as a decision tool for risk management of cyanotoxins and t o compounds in drinking water sources therefore the aim of this study was to develop and validate a biomolecular based monitoring approach as a diagnostic tool and as an alternative to cell count based approaches this approach is anticipated to aid in making decision thresholds in the hazard and risk assessment associated with cyanobacterial toxins and t o compounds in drinking water reservoirs the approach was evaluated and validated in drinking water reservoirs in both taiwan and the philippines that have significant problems with the occurrence of toxigenic and t o producing cyanobacteria the effectiveness of this approach was examined with respect to the opportunity to provide a major advance to achieve increased speed and efficiency to characterize cyanobacterial hazards relative to the more conventional and time consuming cell count based approaches in addition the approach developed here is the first time that both the hazard and risk for both t o and toxins from cyanobacteria have been considered together in a monitoring scheme and offers an improved means for determining the response levels in the risk assessment process for cyanobacteria and their metabolites in drinking water sources the term response levels rls is used here to avoid any conflict with the widely accepted term for the system of alert levels which are in widespread usage exclusively for cyanotoxin public health risk assessment and management 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling water samples were collected from reservoirs on taiwan main island 10 reservoirs taiwan s two offshore islands 19 reservoirs and in the philippines 1 lake these reservoirs are important sources of drinking water which have been reports of cyanotoxins or t o problems or with a high potential for cyanobacterial blooms based upon the phosphorus levels in reservoirs a total of 518 518 and 275 samples were collected for mc cyn and 2 mib and the associated cyanobacteria responsible for producing them respectively during the period 2012 to 2016 from the 29 reservoirs details of the locations for the sampling of the 29 reservoirs in taiwan were reported in chiu et al 2016 2017 in addition 36 samples were collected from laguna de bay in the philippines during the period of august 18 22 2016 laguna de bay in the philippines is the largest inland water resource and is a source of domestic water supply for the western part of metro manila and is known to have many cyanobacterial blooms baldia et al 2003 downing et al 2001 2 2 cell enumeration the species and numbers of cyanobacterial cells were identified and counted by microscopy bx 51 olympus japan with a s52 sedgwick rafter chamber graticules ltd uk following the procedures of standard method 10200f apha et al 1998 immediately after sampling a lugol s solution 1 by volume was added to the samples for preservation before cell enumeration for the enumeration 1 ml of sample was first added to the sedgwick rafter chamber settled for 30 min and counted under the microscope with a magnification of 400 chiu et al 2017 for measurement of filamentous c raciborskii 30 filaments were initially counted to obtain the average cell number per unit length of c raciborskii trichomes then the cell concentrations were determined based upon the total lengths of the filaments measured in the samples and the cell numbers per unit trichome marbun et al 2012 2 3 measurement of genes regulating toxins t o metabolites of cyanobacteria a qpcr method was used to quantify the genes targeted in the samples details about sample treatment for dna extraction primer and probe sets used for targeted genes and procedures for quantification of dna have been reported in chiu et al 2016 2017 the genes targeted in this study included microcystis 16s rrna gene wilson et al 2000 microcystin producing mcyb genes yen et al 2006 cylindrospermopsis rpoc1 gene schembri et al 2001 cylindrospermopsin producing pks genes rasmussen et al 2008 and the 2 mib producing mibc gene chiu et al 2016 although the mcyb and pks genes only represent potentially toxigenic microcystis spp and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii aphanizomenon ovalisporum raphidiopsis curvata anabaena bergii and oscillatoria sp respectively microcystis spp and c raciborskii have been found to be the major toxin producing species in the studied reservoirs chiu et al 2017 a portable qpcr device smart cycler cepheid ca was used to carry out the on site rapid assessment along with taqman qpcr mixtures which have been reported in chiu et al 2016 2017 the qpcr protocols for the 5 genes includes pre incubation at 95 c a 40 cycle denaturation at 95 c and an annealing extension at 60 c at the end of the extension the fluorescence intensity was recorded at 519 nm for fam 561 nm for cy3 665 nm for cy5 and 615 nm for texas red respectively the threshold cycles ct values and the specificity analysis were conducted using smart cycler software cepheid ca hein et al 2001 marbun et al 2012 whelan et al 2003 2 4 quantification of cyanotoxins enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa based upon the specificity between antibody and antigen engvall and perlmann 1971 was used for the detection of the two cyanotoxins prior to the analysis water samples were sonicated at 250 kw for 60 min digital sonifier branson ultrasonic co ct usa to rupture the cells and release intracellular toxins a subsample of 50 μl from the sonicated samples was used for the assay following the procedures prescribed by the manufacturers commercial immunoassay kits were used in this study pn 520012 for microcystins and pn 522011for cylindrospermopsin both from abraxis llc pennsylvania usa a micro plate spectrophotometer xmark bio rad ca and a multiskan fc thermo scientific finland were coupled with a microplate manager ver 6 software bio rad ca for the measurement 2 5 analysis of t o compounds the t o compounds geosmin and 2 mib were analyzed by the standard method recommended by the taiwan epa niea w537 51b the samples were first filtered for the separation of the total cell bound plus dissolved phase and dissolved portions of 2 mib chiu et al 2016 briefly solid phase micro extraction spme was used for the extraction of the compounds from the samples which were subsequently analyzed with a gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer gc ms 6890 5973 agilent usa detailed information about the spme fiber and experimental conditions for the analysis has been reported in lin et al 2002 2003 and chiu et al 2016 2 6 risk assessment risk levels for the development and occurrence of cyanotoxins and t o compounds in reservoirs were assessed based upon the collection of a range of water quality data relevant to cyanobacterial metabolites including cell numbers of toxigenic microcystis spp and cylindrospermopsis spp along with concentrations of toxins microcystins mcs and cylindrospermopsins cyns and of odor metabolites 2 mib and geosmin geosmin saxitoxins and their producers were not included in this analysis because their concentrations in the samples collected were either below detection limits or were very low following the risk levels suggested by who chorus and bartram 1999 and the water quality research association wqra guidance document newcombe et al 2010 the risk was categorized into three levels described below depending upon the concentrations of cyanobacterial cells measured with microscope and qpcr and the concentrations of cyanotoxins and 2 mib in the drinking water guidelines proposed by different international organizations and agencies the suggested values were 5000 cells ml for microcystis chorus and bartram 1999 and 15 000 cells ml for cylindrospermopsis newcombe et al 2010 to 1 μ g l of microcystin and cylindrospermopsin and 10 ng l for 2 mib japan mhlw 2015 the reservoirs were assigned with specific numerical values for each item detected by comparing the measured concentration in the samples with the corresponding gv for cyanobacterial cells or metabolites 2 7 statistical analysis three separate statistical analyses of the field data sets were required as part of developing and proving an alternative quantitative threshold system for use in a response levels framework firstly to demonstrate the feasibility of using cell gene abundances as indicator for the levels of toxins and odor compounds binary logistic regression was used to correlate cell gene abundances of toxin and odor producers with the concentrations of corresponding cyanotoxins and odor compounds in this analysis each datum was assigned either 0 or 1 depending upon whether it exceeded its proposed threshold concentration level per event the parameters in this logistic regression model were estimated by fitting the generalized linear models in r package mass r 3 4 4 r core team 2018 the resulting s curved illustrates the event probability versus cell numbers or gene copies which provides reference points for setting response level corresponding cell gene concentration additionally the goodness of fit test for logistic regression was evaluated with hosmer lemeshow test peng et al 2002 miecznikowski et al 2013 using package generalhoslem in r jay 2016 secondly to determine a representative value for cell gene quota we assessed the distribution of monitoring data fitted with a lognormal distribution by the distribution fitting tool from matlab version r2016a the mathworks inc usa the results are presented as a probability plot with a standardized value in percentile which provided a measure for setting guideline values of cell gene quotas the goodness of fit test for lognormal distribution was evaluated with the pearson shapiro wilk and anderson darling normality tests using the nortest package in r gross et al 2015 thirdly concordance assessment was used to examine the performance of the modified response level framework by testing the consistency of standard methods such as elisa for toxins and gc ms for odor compounds and alternative methods such as microscope cell numbers and qpcr gene copies then the cohen s kappa for binomial variables was calculated using excel to determine the strength of agreement followed by the statistic procedure kwiecien et al 2011 cohen s kappa statistic gives 6 ranks for strength of agreement poor slight fair moderate substantial and almost perfect which the values accordingly are 0 0 2 0 21 0 4 0 41 0 6 0 61 0 8 0 81 1 of which substantial agreement may be widely accepted and considered as an alternative method for the golden method watson and petrie 2010 3 results and discussion 3 1 correlations between mc cyn 2mib and cell gene abundances although correlations between metabolite levels and corresponding producing gene abundances have been reported based on field samples for mcs cyn and 2 mib yu et al 2014 lee et al 2018 chiu et al 2016 2017 to be applied in response levels the cell gene abundances in relation to any particular threshold metabolite concentrations need to be identified first here the binary logistic regression is applied to determine how well cell gene abundances correlate to particular levels i e guideline values of metabolites the proportions and numbers of samples above detection limits for all sampling data set are shown in supplementary table s3 these samples from cell enumeration and qpcr methods were applied in the logistic regression where each sample is classified into value of 1 or 0 depending upon whether its level of metabolites is equal to or greater than certain concentrations note that the levels of metabolites used in the analysis i e 1 μg l for mc and cyn and 10 ng l for 2 mib were associated with other widely accepted alfs or drinking water quality standards chorus and bartram 1999 newcombe et al 2010 japan mhlw 2015 the s shaped curves in supplementary fig s1 illustrate the increasing probability for trigger level exceedance events to occur for increasing abundance of cell numbers and genes the predictive strength of each logistic model is examined by the hosmer lemeshow goodness of fit test to determine how well the data fits the models supplementary table s3 shows that all the cell gene quota models cannot be rejected for the null hypothesis of a good fit model p value 0 05 suggesting that using the cell gene quotas developed here for particular levels of threshold values in rls is reasonable although the logistic regression model may not be able to provide a high level of accuracy for prediction of the probability for each threshold in terms of cell numbers gene copies it is very useful when the values were incorporated into the development of a management strategy for example in the guidance framework of wqra newcombe et al 2010 the cell number thresholds of 6500 cells ml microcystis and 10 000 cells ml cylindrospermopsis were set for mc 1 3 μg l and cyn 1 0 μg l respectively these cell numbers represent 10 and 50 of probability to exceed the response level thresholds for mc and cyn respectively in supplementary fig s1 similarly in a study from single lake in china su et al 2015 the quantile regression between planktothrix sp biomass and total 2 mib concentration illustrates cell abundance at different probabilities for 2 mib reaching the threshold level of 15 ng l to be 16 50 and 400 cells ml at 10 50 and 90 respectively therefore it is considered that 10 probability would be an appropriate reference level to achieve a suitable degree of certainty for responding to the perceived hazard in source waters similarly for this reference level the mc thresholds of 0 3 1 0 and 10 μg l are represented by 630 6 500 and 100 000 cells ml or 60 250 and 6000 gene copies g c ml supplementary table s3 illustrates the values for the probability of exceedance of response trigger levels with regards to cell numbers and gene copies 3 2 cell and gene quota in log normal distribution the alert levels als recommended in the two widely used guidance documents are 0 3 1 and 10 μg l for mc for the defined levels of vigilance 1 and 2 respectively chorus and bartram 1999 newcombe et al 2010 newcombe et al 2010 also applied these same thresholds for cyn i e 0 3 1 and 10 μg l for levels 1 2 and 3 respectively note that the three levels in chorus and bartram 1999 i e vigilance 1 and 2 are equivalent to levels 1 3 in newcombe et al 2010 given that the guideline value for 2 mib is set at 10 ng l japan mhlw 2015 the response levels 1 2 and 3 used here for this odor compound are set at 3 10 and 100 ng l respectively these published als and our response levels were linked with cell concentrations based upon cell quotas of the toxins odor compounds for typical nuisance harmful cyanobacteria although some field studies have reported level of metabolites with cell count numbers briand et al 2012 dai et al 2008 downing et al 2005 orr and jones 1998 rasmussen et al 2008 watzin et al 2006 the results showed that diverse ranges of cqs were obtained and absence in the literature of a well defined span of cell quotas for the studied toxins odor compounds in natural system provides challenges for setting response levels the toxin and odor levels in this study together with cell gene abundance collected from 29 reservoirs over 4 years were converted into cell gene quotas for which the toxin or 2 mib concentrations were divided by the corresponding cell numbers or gene copies measured for the same samples the c gqs data were tested to examine the fit with log normal distribution as shown in fig 1 the data fits to linear line under a log probability plots the fit of normal distributions in the log scale were tested by the anderson darling test and the pearson chi square normality test in r 3 4 4 both tests hold for the null hypothesis of normal distribution for each quota set while the p value less than the 5 significance level means that the null hypothesis will be rejected table 1 lists the c gqs at different percentiles means and standard deviations for microcystins cylindrospermopsin and 2 mib based on the field data interpreted with log normal distribution model in this study furukawa et al 2006 rinta kanto et al 2009 and ha et al 2011 have analyzed samples collected from natural waters in japan and usa and obtained mc gene quota these data sets which included 12 samples from lake erie in usa measured for mcyd rinta kanto et al 2009 and 4 samples from lake kitaura and kasumigaura furukawa et al 2006 and 9 samples from a fishpond ha et al 2011 in japan analyzed for mcya were combined with our data of 122 samples from 29 taiwanese reservoirs and laguna de bay from the philippines analyzed for mcyb fig 2 demonstrates clearly that the combined gene quota set can still fit a log normal distribution this analysis passed the pearson shapiro wilk and anderson darling normality tests with p values equal to 0 78 0 07 and 0 09 respectively the mean and the range of mean standard deviation were 0 66 and 0 06 7 15 pg g c respectively which is similar to that of the original distribution 0 68 and 0 11 4 22 pg g c respectively although with a larger standard deviation this is because the data published from other studies tended to report only extreme values i e maximum and minimum values 3 3 cell and gene based response levels for metabolites it is possible to compare the two methods for their values at the same levels as both the logistic regression method and log normal distribution provide probabilities for gene cell quota for specific toxin odor compound level in other words a comparison can be made for the estimates of the cell gene abundances that are likely to occur for the same probability of exceedance of a threshold by these two approaches for example a concentration of mc lr 1 μg l will be estimated to be associated with gene copy abundances of 145 and 250 g c ml from log normal distribution and logistic regression methods respectively a similar trend was also found for all other combinations of toxin odor compound and cell gene quotas studied suggesting that the results obtained from the log normal distribution method is more conservative than from the logistic regression method this is due to the fact that for each toxin odor compound level lower cell gene number was determined using the log normal distribution method therefore the parameters extracted from the log normal distribution models are used to determine the cell gene based response levels currently the water quality guideline values for mc and cyn can be represented by the corresponding cell numbers of microcystis and cylindrospermopsis for example 1 μg l of mc and cyn is approximately equivalent to 5000 cells ml 1 and 13 000 cells ml 1 respectively as proposed by who chorus and bartram 1999 and wqra newcombe et al 2010 respectively therefore the derived cell quotas are 0 2 pg cell 1 for microcystis sp and 0 067 pg cell 1 for cylindrospermopsis sp corresponding to 80th and 60th percentiles respectively when compared with the log normal distribution model developed in this study fig 1 the cell quotas corresponding to 80th and 60th percentiles illustrated that 20 and 40 of the events may not be captured based upon the current field data as listed in table 1 higher cell quotas lead to larger percentiles and therefore lower cell numbers and gene copies for the same targeted toxin odor compound level to be more conservative in risk management for cyanobacteria a 90th percentile based cell quota may be a more suitable basis for environmental monitoring barnett and o hagan 1997 however the determination and selection of the desired percentile may be water resource dependent for example for a supplemental water supply reservoir a lower percentile of quota may be acceptable for setting response levels table 2 lists the c gqs for mc cyn and 2 mib at three rls based on the 90th percentiles cell gene quotas obtained from the log normal distribution model as shown in the table the toxin odor compound concentration at each rl may be transferred to the abundance of cell numbers or corresponding producing genes the cell numbers and gene abundances provided may thus serve as references for the determination of rls in source water for different toxins odor compounds and based upon the response level appropriate management actions may be triggered by water resource management agencies and water utilities as suggested in who chorus and bartram 1999 and wqra newcombe et al 2010 3 4 analysis of data and model agreement the agreement between the models and data were further evaluated using concordance assessment watson and petrie 2010 to evaluate if the proposed alternative rls were reasonable this analysis was used to determine whether consistent agreement can be achieved between the data and model for each of the c gqs determined at three different percentiles 50 75 and 90 percentiles which can be then selected for appropriate application in different source water management scenarios based upon the database of gene cell abundance and toxin and odor compound concentrations collected over 2012 2016 in this study the alternative rls table 2 built upon by cell gene methods can be examined through concordance assessment since the rls considered cell and gene quantity to represent the level of metabolites the metabolite concentrations monitored and analyzed with elisa for toxins or gc ms for 2 mib were used as standards in the assessment while the cell and gene quantity obtained by microscopy and qpcr analysis served as alternatives in the assessment each data set was analyzed for different rls according to its cell or gene abundances for example in one of the data sets the levels of mcyb and mc are 200 g c ml and 1 8 μg l respectively if we consider the rls with 90th percentile gq this datum point belongs to rl 2 i e mc 1 μg l in which case the gene level should be more than 145 g c ml table 2 there are four potential cases i e positive positive false negative false positive and negative negative by which in this first case both the standard mc concentration and the alternative gene abundance are greater than the rl for both mcyb and mc this leads to positive positive result called presence for both standard and alternative on the other hand if for another set of data mcyb is 100 g c ml and mc level is 1 8 μg l it will be a false negative as the standard is positive while the alternative is negative for false positive cases the metabolite concentrations are lower than the rls while their cells or gene abundances are higher than the rls the last case is negative negative in which both metabolites concentrations and cell gene abundance are lower than the rls it is noted that higher ratios of positive positive and negative negative cases in all the data assessed represent better agreement between the standards and alternatives fig 3 and supplementary fig s2 show the distributions of the data in the four cases for both cell enumeration and gene measurement in the figures the standards logarithmic values of toxin concentrations measured relative to those at rl2 mc 1 μg l and cyn 0 7 μg l were plotted against the alternative logarithmic values of gene cell abundance measured relative to those at rl2 microcystis 2800 cells ml cylindrospermopsis 1130 cells ml mcyb 145 g c ml and pks 20 g c ml the figures clearly show that gene measurement data are better than cell enumeration ones higher numbers of positive positive in the figures mcyb 37 microcystis cells 36 and negative negative mcyb 84 microcystis cells 55 but no false negative cases were found for mcyb and pks gene based method if compared to the cell enumeration based method for microcystis and cylindrospermopsis table 3 summarizes the results for the concordance assessment for the toxins and odor compounds investigated the results show that in general better agreement higher cohen s kappa value are obtained in the vigilance and response level 1 compared to the response level 2 this is due to the fact that kappa value is related to the proportion of cases categorized as positive by standard method watson and petrie 2010 for example only 3 values of 518 of the monitoring data for cyn exceeded the concentration of 7 μg l and this low prevalence 0 005 resulted in a low kappa value for mc the agreement with the gene based rls was better than those based upon cell counts although the data for c gqs at 50th percentiles showed the highest level of agreement those for gqs at the 90th percentiles are also in good agreement given that cohen s kappa of 0 61 0 80 and 0 41 0 6 indicates substantial agreement and moderate agreement respectively kwiecien et al 2011 for the cases of cyn although agreement was also found for rls 1 and 2 at rl3 the data for cyn and cells genes cannot be considered to be in good agreement this is because only three monitoring data points had concentrations of 7 μg l cyn leading to the disagreement of the standards and alternatives for 2 mib the analysis was made between the gene abundances and total cell bound odor compound levels theoretically 2 mib genes are present in 2 mib producing cyanobacteria chiu et al 2016 and therefore better correlations would be expected between the genes and cell bound 2 mib if compared to those for total 2 mib cell bound dissolved indeed as shown in table 3 better agreement is found for the data between the genes and cell bound 2 mib for both rls 1 and 2 the agreement between 2 mib gene abundance and 2 mib concentration was however less strong for rl3 this is due to the lower prevalence of data with high 2 mib concentrations where the number of samples with exceedance of rl3 i e 2 mib concentrations 100 ng l occurred on only 21 occasions prevalence 0 07 which was far fewer than those for samples 100 ng l this is similar to the circumstance discussed for cyn in this study both with very limited data at higher concentration range also shown in table 3 for almost all the cases for mc the gene based rls were in better agreement with the metabolite concentrations than those based on cell numbers in the cases of cyn the gene based rls are in similar degrees of agreement with those based upon cell numbers detection of toxin and odor compound producing genes have become more and more popular pacheco et al 2016 compared to the traditional labor intensive and time consuming cell enumeration methods biomolecular detection method offers a more rapid and precise method to quantify the potential for the occurrence of toxins and odor compounds in the water chiu et al 2016 2017 in addition cell enumeration cannot differentiate toxigenic and non toxigenic cells leading to inherent uncertainty in the estimation of the potential for the population to produce toxins and or odors the gene based approach as proposed in this study and in our view provides a more accurate estimation of the levels of cyanobacterial metabolites and more reliable reference for setting the response levels for the potential hazards from cyanobacteria and metabolites in drinking water reservoirs 3 5 application of the gene based rls model to laguna de bay philippines the response level model proposed in this study was also applied and evaluated using the field data collected from laguna de bay in manila philippines during august 18 22 2016 laguna de bay the second largest lake in south eastern asia with an area of 900 km2 is well known to have cyanobacterial blooms and odor problems thirty six samples were collected in a near uniform pattern distributed across the entire lake the samples were analyzed using qpcr for the mcyb pks and mibc genes by elisa for mcs and cyns and by gc ms for 2 mib following a similar approach for the evaluation of agreement reported above a dataset of 108 values for the three sets of toxins odor compounds were assessed in concordance with the prescribed analysis given above this was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed rls with the 90th percentile for gqs table 4 shows the results of this analysis the cohen s kappa of 0 6 suggests substantial strength of agreement between the toxin odor compound concentrations and gene abundances as indicated in the table all 33 samples with metabolite concentration greater than the rls were all detected with gene abundances greater than the corresponding rl indicating positive positive results all of the corresponding gene abundances were also measured at lower than rl1 for samples with metabolite concentrations lower than rl1 this represents negative negative cases in 22 of the 108 data points the measured gene abundance which exceeded the rl1 threshold however metabolite concentrations were lower than the rl1 threshold which was considered a false positive result for the assessment of hazard and management of cyanobacteria in water sources an unsatisfactory situation occurs when either toxin or odor compound is present in the water and the analytical methods used do not detect them leading to false negatives in the analysis of this dataset none of the data values fell into this category further considering both the degree of agreement between the standard and alternative values and the high percentage of positive positive results and no negative positive results the proposed gene based approach for assessing compliance with response levels is quite satisfactory for the monitoring of cyanobacterial hazards in laguna de bay 4 conclusions the robustness of the gene based methodology approach as an effective diagnostic tool for risk level determination for harmful cyanobacteria was evaluated using the data collected from 30 drinking water reservoirs lakes in taiwan and philippines either a logistic regression or log normal distribution model was able to adequately describe the relationships between the cell numbers gene copies or c gqs of microcystis cylindrospermopsis mcs cyn and 2 mib and their corresponding probability of exceeding rl thresholds the c gqs obtained were able to be used as references for rls under different risk levels for toxins and 2 mib episodes concordance assessment was further used to evaluate the agreements between the proposed gene based approach and toxin and 2 mib concentrations relative to the more conventional and time consuming cell count based approach the gene based approach has been shown to have a more accurate estimation of the occurrence of the selected toxins and 2 mib in the 29 reservoirs in taiwan and has been validated in laguna de bay in the philippines although the gene based approach reflects more specifically the targeted metabolites it needs information on the abundance of producing genes and therefore biomolecular instrumentation capability and training are required in addition as the method is based on dna measurement expression of toxin odor compounds producing genes may be dependent upon cyanobacterial species and growth phases and environmental conditions therefore long term monitoring at lakes reservoirs of interest may help to better understand the toxin odor compound producing risks for the conventional approach based upon cell enumeration only a microscope and professionals with experience of cyanobacteria taxonomy is required while the conventional approach has been widely applied in many countries the bio molecular method which has become more accessible recently has the potential to be widely used in research communities and water management agencies in addition cell enumeration cannot differentiate between toxigenic and non toxigenic cells leading to more uncertainties of the toxigenic producing potential the biomolecular based approach as proposed in this study appears to provide more accurate estimation of the metabolite producing cyanobacteria thus serving as a more reliable reference for setting the response levels for cyanobacteria and metabolites in drinking water
