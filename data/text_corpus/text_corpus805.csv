republic of korea corresponding author this manuscript was handled by marco borga editor in chief with the assistance of lixin wangi associate editor partitioning evapotranspiration et into soil evaporation e soil canopy interception evaporation e ic and transpiration t yields both comprehensive insight into hydrological processes and better water management but it is challenging this study proposes a modified ecosystem conductance based priestley taylor mec pt algorithm for et partitioning based on the total ecosystem conductance g total fractions of soil interception and canopy datasets from 24 flux towers around the world were used to estimate g total by coupling aerodynamic conductance and surface conductance g s results from the mec pt model were compared with those from an original best fit ecosystem level conductance m order model that only partitions g s into soil and canopy domains the superior performance of the mec pt model with the inclusion of an intercepted contributor and ability to fill the data gap associated with the m order during wet conditions describes the robustness of this approach for partitioning et the mec pt model results might reflect dew formation that produces minimal e ic volume under non rainfall conditions with support from the diurnal temperature dt presence the ratio of t to total et t et was found highest in forest with 0 72 0 17 of standard deviation followed by savanna 0 57 0 11 cropland 0 48 0 10 and grassland 0 39 0 17 also sensitivity analysis was conducted with main input variables of the mec pt and m order models over four land cover types and the whole study period of each site used in this study the results demonstrated that in general conditions net radiation was the key driver controlling t et variations whereas air temperature and wind speed indirectly and slightly affected t et this study underlines that the inclusion of e ic might bridge the gap in knowledge about et and its components regarding canopy dynamics and ecosystem behaviors in the context of climate change keywords evapotranspiration partitioning total ecosystem conductance interception evaporation t et gpp 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key component of the earth s hydrological system and surface energy balance jung et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 with an annual return of more than 60 of global precipitation back into the atmosphere and consumption of latent heat which accounts for more than 50 of global solar radiation burba and verma 2005 trenberth 2009 mu et al 2011 et is described as the process returning water to the atmosphere via plant transpiration t and evaporation from both soil e soil and intercepted water from wet leaves and surfaces e ic kool et al 2014 t was reported as the major component of et in most previous studies which demonstrated a significant role of t in yearly rainfall sutanto et al 2014 however the accurate quantification of its magnitude is challenging as an example jasechko et al 2013 attributed approximately 80 90 of terrestrial et to t using isotopic analysis with a global dataset over a large lakes and rivers network the results from an integrated hydrologic simulation coupling vegetation and lateral ground flow suggested that t accounted for two thirds of global et maxwell and condon 2016 more recently lian et al 2018 concluded that the mean global transpired fraction of et is 62 6 based on an emergent constraint integrating cmip5 earth system models similarly the ratio of esoil to et is unclear possibly because of the methodological assumptions for example good et al 2015 found that mean global e soil predicted using the large scale water isotope method amounted to 65 of et whereas wei et al 2017 using regression equations without consideration of e ic yielded a zonally averaged e soil as low as 25 this proportion might also be larger in agricultural areas due to irrigation aouade et al 2016 eic is likely to range from 10 to 22 under different conditions in one study it normally contributed around 12 to annual et but could account for more than 20 in the rainy season raz yaseef et al 2012 this high proportion emphasizes that eic plays an undeniable role in et the broad variation in the relative size of these components highlights our poor understanding of et partitioning in surface water balance and motivates more studies related to et contributors a review of 52 et partitioning publications by kool et al 2014 found that these studies tended to ignore the intercepted component and considered it as a residual of two others failing to take interception flux into account when partitioning et might lead to a different proportion of t sutanto et al 2012 in et which is denoted as t et accurate assessments of t et are needed to improve our knowledge of et components as well as their influence on surface hydrological cycles and their variation under changing environmental conditions miralles et al 2011 therefore et partitioning models have been developed from the perspective of comprehensive t et assessment fisher et al 2008 yao et al 2013 yao et al 2015 for example the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl was introduced by fisher et al 2008 to estimate et as the sum of t e soil and e ic et t e soil e ic this method does not require calibration tuning or spin ups and it can be validated directly against eddy flux measurements fisher et al 2008 however the pt jpl model requires complex satellite based estimation of relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd for constraining soil evaporation yao et al 2013 therefore yao et al 2013 proposed a modified satellite based priestley taylor ms pt model that measures et as the sum of four contributors t saturated soil evaporation e s wet soil surface evaporation ews and eic et t e s e ws e ic to avoid the limitations of the pt jpl model the ms pt algorithm uses diurnal temperature dt derived from air temperature t a or land surface temperature instead of rh and vpd in its soil moisture constraint estimates the ms pt algorithm requires only four key input parameters net radiation r n t a dt and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi thus only the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis product is used to provide ndvi decreasing the complexity compared with the pt jpl model other meteorological variables i e r n t a and dt can be retrieved from either satellite yao et al 2013 or eddy covariance flux towers yao et al 2017 for the ms pt algorithm however when using ground observed data significant discrepancies were found between ground truth et and estimated et due to inhibition of the parameterization schemes for soil evaporation constraints in the ms pt algorithm yao et al 2017 in addition the separate equations for each et component are accompanied by structural complexities that are likely to produce inaccuracies when processing an et partitioning model leading to imprecise t et results to improve the accuracy of t et and simplify the model partitioning process high frequency fluxnet data have been used to design et partitioning methods based on the theory that e and t are driven by different environmental factors t is purely associated with plants via photosynthesis and is a key influence on et separation whereas e depends primarily on soil and environmental factors therefore shuttleworth and wallace 1985 developed a dual source et method based on a combination theory that couples conception of the bulk stomatal resistance with one of the surface resistance using the penman monteith pm equation penman 1948 monteith 1965 the pm equation was applied here due to its ability to analyze evaporation from surfaces of a closed vegetation cover and of bare substrate shuttleworth and wallace 1985 subsequently as the inverse of surface resistance r s is surface conductance g s shuttleworth and wallace 1985 first partitioned g s into vegetation conductance g c and soil conductance g soil and then separated t and evaporation e based on that perspective lin et al 2018 introduced a best fit ecosystem level conductance m order model that combines empirical and optimal techniques to derive stomatal conductance medlyn et al 2011 leuning 1995 using hourly fluxnet data the m order model characterizes the features of ecosystem conductance and describes how it varies under different vpd and soil moisture conditions also the estimated ecosystem level conductance from this best fit model includes both soil and vegetation portions because it represents the conductance of soil surface along with vapor flow via stomata openings and total leaf area which has the potential to partition et into related components in that way li et al 2019 used the m order model to separate gs into gsoil and gc in an effort to compute t et gsoil and gc retrieved from the m order model were primarily data constrained which was different from the parameterization driven methods used by the other two source approaches however to avoid interception from wet plants this approach requires data elimination during and after rainfall together with data at rh greater than 95 accordingly frequent rainfall events might cause issues with data availability which apparently lead to inaccuracy indeed li et al 2019 reported that fewer data points can result in larger uncertainty when using the m order model generally the ms pt algorithm provides adequate estimations of et contributors but it performs inefficiently when using flux measurement data and involves elaborate calculations although the m order model might perform effectively and simply by adopting that dataset it does not include an interception contribution in the estimation therefore we propose a modified ecosystem conductance based priestley taylor mec pt model that combines the advantages of the two earlier models to separate et into soil interception and canopy contributions with the inclusion of interception the aerodynamic conductance g a was considered along with g s in this study due to its description of conductance from the canopy layer upward and its involvement in the land atmosphere interactions allen et al 1998 accordingly the sum of g a and g s was specified as the total ecosystem conductance g total which integrates all conductance across the entire path from leaf and soil surfaces to the overlying air then g total was partitioned into g soil g c and g ic by conducting the proposed mec pt model to further compute t et in comparison with the m order model the major improvements of the mec pt models are the measurement of the g ic together with the presence of the aerodynamic conductance our primary objectives in this study are 1 to partition et into e soil e ic and t by separating the related conductance 2 to investigate e ic variations after rainfall pulses and during non rainfall conditions using the mec pt model 3 to examine variations in the t et estimated by the mec pt model across land cover types and 4 to understand the roles of meteorological and environmental factors in t et by running sensitivity analyses with the m order and mec pt models the inclusion of e ic in et partitioning models that use ecosystem conductance might improve our understanding of canopy dynamics and ecosystem processes that control et as well as their respective drivers enabling better water management 2 flux towers and remote sensing datasets to measure total ecosystem conductance using the pm framework the selected sites had to include micrometeorological variables such as t a r n vpd rh p and wind speed ws together with other mandatory meteorological parameters other energy components such as latent heat flux le ground heat flux g and sensible heat flux h were also required gross primary productivity gpp which is computed based the nighttime respiration partitioning method by the fluxnet community is especially important in this dataset therefore half hourly eddy flux datasets from 24 sites around the world were retrieved with most sites located in australia and north america https fluxnet fluxdata org detail information of these sites is provided in fig 1 and table 1 we split the sites into four land cover categories cropland grassland savanna and forest data were screened and subjected to quality control to select data points that meet the requirements of our ecosystem conductance model first we excluded data with incoming shortwave radiation lower than 50 w m 2 and sensible heat smaller than 5 w m 2 to ignore the stable status of the boundary layer as it can restrict the performance of conductance measurement allen et al 1998 second negative gpp et and vpd were removed third to weaken the effect of random noise half hourly data were converted into six hourly data the data availability for each study site after applying these three filters is given in table 2 compared to the original m order model the major differences in screening data procedure for the mec pt model were 1 retaining data during and after a rainfall pulse and 2 processing data with rh exceeding 95 to reflect the e ic of wet canopy the mod13 product line was launched with a series of vegetation index components using nasa s modis sensor along with ndvi and an enhanced vegetation index in this study ndvi with a temporal resolution of 16 days and a spatial resolution of 1 km was retrieved from the mod13a2 product downloaded from https e4ftl01 cr usgs gov molt mod13a2 006 the study duration of the mod13a2 product was the same as that for each eddy flux tower the spatial coverages of the mod13a2 product covered the locations of the 24 flux tower sites 3 methodology 3 1 partitioning framework 3 1 1 total ecosystem conductance g total based on an inverted penman monteith equation g total was estimated by inverting the pm equation penman 1948 monteith 1965 using climatological variables from the fluxnet dataset 1 g total g a γ l e δ r n g l e g a ρ c p v p d a where γ is a psychrometric constant kpa c 1 g a is aerodynamic conductance m s 1 le is latent heat flux w m 2 δ is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 r n is net radiation w m 2 g is ground heat flux w m 2 ρ is density of air kg m 3 c p is the air specific heat j kg 1c 1 and vp d a is the vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere kpa an algorithm for g a was described in lin et al 2018 in this equation the unit for g total was originally m s 1 but it was converted to mol m 2 s 1 using the ideal gas law for consistency with the unit of ecosystem conductance pearcy et al 1989 li et al 2019 in addition g total values can be seen as outliers and excluded if they range outside the 5th or 95th percentile detailed information for inverting the pm equation can be found in appendix b 1 next considering a report from knauer 2018 that climatic conditions at the surface of the canopy are physiologically more sensitive than those in the atmospheric layer above the vegetation the inverted leaf level vpd v p d l was used instead of vp d a in the ecosystem conductance models lin et al 2018 li et al 2019 vp d l was defined based on the theory of leaf scale vpd such that on the leaf surface e s t leaf e a where t leaf is the temperature on the surface of the leaf e s t leaf is the saturation of vapor pressure at t leaf and e a is the vapor pressure of the air lin et al 2018 found that vp d l was more effective in describing ecosystem conductance mechanisms and in assessing aridity at the leaf level than vp d a here vp d l kpa was calculated using a definition in which le crosses the big leaf surface at the ecosystem level after calculating the total ecosystem conductance g total m s 1 monteith 1965 lin et al 2018 2 vp d l γ l e ρ c p g total 3 1 2 ms pt algorithms the ms pt model minimizes the number of input parameters to the four key variables of r n t a dt and ndvi it estimates et as the total of t unsaturated soil evaporation e s saturated wet soil surface evaporation e ws and e ic yao et al 2013 2014 in this study soil evaporation e soil was seen as the sum of e s and e ws e soil e s e ws accordingly we propose a ratio between e soil and e ic denoted as r sie to assess the relationship between them e ic 1 r sie e soil the equation conducting r sie was first built based on the equations estimating e s e ws and e ic from the ms pt model yao et al 2013 the estimated r sie was then used as an input of the mec pt model to represent the relationship between g ic and g soil g ic g soil 1 r sie a step by step guide for retrieving r sie was provided in appendix a and the equation for r sie was finally shortened as 3 r sie 0 82 1 f v f v

are taken as 0 95 and 0 05 respectively f sm is the soil moisture constraint dt is the diurnal temperature range and is calculated from t a dt tmax tmin zhang et al 2003 wang et al 2009 in which tmax and tmin are respectively the maximum and minimum air temperature in each six hour period and d t max is the maximum dt for the whole study period of each flux tower detail descriptions regarding to other parameters are provided in appendix d 3 1 3 conductance partitioning in previous studies lin et al 2018 and li et al 2019 removed data during and after rainfall together with data from periods when rh exceeded 95 to ignore the interception contribution in this study we retained all data during and after rain as well as during wet conditions to reflect the contribution of g ic also considering the coupling between the surface of the canopy and the atmosphere which results in a large rate of evaporation from wet canopy g a is added to g s here to produce g total as such g total which is measured with an inverted pm equation can be described as 6 g total g soil g ic g c to partition g total into separate components we modified the m order model into a new ecosystem conductance model the mec pt model the m order model was introduced by lin et al 2018 based on leuning s method leuning 1995 and medlyn s method medlyn et al 2011 and was used to assess the variation of g s at different ecosystem scales by detecting the best fit parameters of the vpd exponent m g s g 0 g 1 gpp vp d l m from that generalization li et al 2019 partitioned g s into two domains by decomposing g soil g 0 and g c g 1 gpp vp d l m corresponding to e soil and t respectively however that technique is limited by the significant lack of a g ic component to overcome that limitation we introduce the mec pt model to partition g total into g soil g ic and g c with support from the r sie ratio inferred by the ms pt algorithm which presents the relationship between g soil and g ic the equation for g total in the mec pt model becomes 7 g total g 0 g 0 1 r sie g 1 gpp vp d l m where g 0 mol m 2 s 1 g 1 kpam mol µmol 1 and m are fitted parameters and gpp is gross primary productivity µmol m 2 s 1 for the exponent of vp d l leuning 1995 and medlyn et al 2011 used fixed values of 1 and 0 5 respectively for all study sites however lin et al 2018 found that using variable exponents of vp d l by site is more effective than using a fixed exponent for all sites to describe the characteristic of canopy conductance and its dependence on vpd in each study area therefore in this study the exponent of vp d l in eq 7 m was varied across sites to the best fit value a non linear regression using ordinary least squares ols was applied to determine the fitted parameter g 0 g 1 and m for each site table s1 provides the fitted parameters used for each site in this study in the following frameworks of separation it was assumed that only g c is relevant to photosynthesis and gpp is used here as a variable expressing that process in terms of an ecosystem conductance model accordingly g c is reflected only by g 1 gpp vp d l m which is proportional to gpp g 0 might reflect both g soil and minimum g c as noted by lin et al 2018 nevertheless compared with e soil the minimum g c is inconsequential because it expresses only epidermal and cuticular losses even in extremely arid environments lin et al 2015 medlyn et al 2017 g ic is here obtained by using the relationship between e soil and e ic therefore g ic is driven by g 0 and r sie as a result g total was finally partitioned into g soil g ic and g c 8 g soil g 0 9 g ic g 0 1 r sie 10 g c g 1 gpp vp d l m 3 1 4 evapotranspiration partitioning thus et can be partitioned into e soil e ic and t as shown in fig s1 first the pm model indicates terrestrial resistance as a single source structure fig s1a second in the shuttleworth wallace model terrestrial resistance is treated as a dual parallel source similar to g soil and g c fig s1b which was applied to partition et in the m order model third in the mec pt model introduced here total resistance is separated into three parallel resistances that correspond to g soil g ic and g c fig s1c based on the et partitioning concept of the ms pt model accordingly the entire et can be partitioned using flux conservation theory li et al 2019 as follows 11 et r total e ic r ic e soil r soil t r c where r total is the total ecosystem resistance r total 1 g total r soil is soil surface resistance r soil 1 g soil r ic is water interception resistance r ic 1 g ic and r c is canopy surface resistance r c 1 g c the partitioning equations are 12 e soil et r total r soil g soil g total 13 e ic et r total r ic g ic g total 14 t et r total r c g c g total the sum of e soil et e ic et and t et is always equal to 1 a flowchart illustrating the study framework is provided in fig 2 and the equations of the mec pt model are summarized in appendix b 2 3 2 the m order model to compare and examine the performance of the mec pt model we used another ecosystem conductance model the m order model g s g 0 g 1 gpp vp d l m in that approach data from the 24 flux towers were handled in a manner similar to that of the mec pt model however data during and within six hours after rainfall together with data when rh exceeded 95 were removed to ignore g ic the ols method was also used in non linear regression to achieve fitted values g 0 g 1 m that were then used to determine g soil and g c details can be found in li et al 2019 and appendix c 3 3 criteria evaluations to examine the performance of the ecosystem conductance models statistical comparison metrics such as index of agreement ioa and root mean square error rmse were exploited ioa explains the degree of match between observed and modeled values and it varies from 0 to 1 willmott et al 2012 baik and choi 2015 rmse is the standard deviation of the predicted uncertainties and is used to investigate the concentration of data which is around the line of best fit barnston 1992 in this study higher ioa demonstrates better agreement between estimated values and observed ones while lower rmse means that modeled values are closer to observed values the equations for these statistical evaluations are as follows 15 ioa 1 i 1 n m i o i 2 n n m i o o i o 2 0 ioa 1 16 rmse i 1 n m i o i 2 n where m i and o i are the values estimated by models and the observation n is the total number of data during studied period i presents for ith number of samples o is the mean of observation 4 results and discussion in this study the mec pt model was run with a dataset from 24 flux tower sites and those sites were divided into four land cover categories savanna grassland forest and cropland to examine the performance of the mec pt model the g total estimated by mec pt is validated against that from the inverted pm equation in section 4 1 because the observation of g total was not provided in the eddy covariance data section 4 2 proves the reasonability of the e ic et results given by the mec pt model and analyzes the effects of rainfall and dew formation on e ic in an effort to partition et the results for the et components given by the mec pt model are further discussed in section 4 3 finally because the dominant component of et is t the dependence of t et on meteorological and environmental factors is investigated by conducting sensitivity analyses with both the mec pt and m order models the results of the sensitivity analyses are illustrated in section 4 4 4 1 comparisons of ecosystem conductance 4 1 1 comparison the mec pt model vs the inverted pm equation the g total estimated from the pm equation was considered as the observed g total following li et al 2019 to investigate the performance of the mec pt approach we compared the g total estimated by the mec pt model with that from the inverted pm equation as a time series and in bar charts fig 3 a ioa and rmse were applied as evaluation criteria for this comparison fig 3b as shown in fig 3a the g total estimated by the mec pt model and observations inverted pm equation differed little throughout the study period at the us ton site also comparable variations were seen in ndvi and g total to examine the performance of the mec pt model at other sites ioa and rmse were applied to the results from all the studied sites fig 3b good agreement was observed between g total from the mec pt and the pm models for most land cover types the best performance was exhibited in savanna with a higher ioa ranging from 0 77 to 0 96 and lower rmse 0 01 0 04 mol m 2 s 1 than in the other land cover types forest on the other hand had the worst performance with an ioa ranging from 0 57 to 0 88 and rmse from 0 05 to 0 28 mol m 2 s 1 performance for cropland was stable with an ioa of around 0 70 and rmse of roughly 0 17 mol m 2 s 1 in general the mec pt model based g total did not differ much from that of the inverted pm equation although interception is included in the proposed algorithm the proposed model showed good results with a high mean ioa of 0 76 and a low mean rmse of 0 11 mol m 2 s 1 across all study sites this match between the two g total values confirms the validity of the mec pt model which combines the ms pt algorithm and m order model to partition total ecosystem conductance besides the similar pattern in ndvi and g total indicates that ndvi has the potential to be a controlling factor in ecosystem conductance models therefore the application of ndvi in the estimates was expected to reflect the characteristics of the vegetation layer in the studied areas potentially predicting reliable t et ratios ferreira et al 2003 zhang et al 2003 4 1 2 evaluation of g c by the mec pt and m order models the g c estimated by the mec pt model was compared with that produced by the m order model to further examine the performance of the mec pt model the g c values computed by both models for all 24 flux tower sites are shown as a scatterplot in fig 4 and the values from two sites with different rainfall conditions are shown as time series data in fig s2 as shown in the scatterplot fig 4 the magnitude of g c estimated by the mec pt model was consistent with that estimated by the m order model at savanna and grassland sites however the mec pt model produced varied g c estimates in highly vegetated area especially forest sites where had significantly greater g c a further comparison between the g c calculated using the two methods is shown as a time series for the us ton savanna and ca gro forest sites fig s2 the us ton site where rainfall density was sparse shows the similarity between the two modeled g c values by contrast rainfall at ca gro was much denser than at the us ton site the mec pt model perform results for the many rainy days i e in periods shaded with the light green color in us ton site whereas the m order model lacked results under those conditions therefore compared to the m order model the mec pt model exhibited better continuity of data for this site the differences in magnitudes of g c estimated by the mec pt and m order models varied by land cover type the mec pt model produced magnitudes of g c equivalent to those of the m order model for the savanna and grassland sites because vegetation coverage remained sparse in those types of land cover with the low ndvi table 1 incorporating ndvi into the mec pt estimates did not create a notable difference between the two g c values also the low rainfall density in those biomes table 1 did not generate a significant discrepancy in the amount of data processed by the mec pt and m order models table 2 conversely the different g c estimated by the mec pt model in cropland and forest were attributed to the effect of higher ndvi representing denser vegetation coverage in these biomes table 1 this demonstrates that including ndvi in the mec pt model better describes the canopy status for each land cover type also the higher g c estimations of the mec pt model occurred at several forest sites might be because of both their dense vegetation and the frequent rainfall for example wang erlandsson et al 2014 found that 45 of annual global mean t occurred within three hours after a rainfall event therefore the mec pt model predicted higher g c partly because it used data from rainy and wet conditions allowing it to reflect the entirety of t as can be seen in table 2 these two models used different amounts of data for each site after screening the data to meet their requirements the mec pt model was regularly processed with a higher number of data points than the m order model at each site this underlined that the mec pt model was able to bridge the data gap associated with the m order model on rainy days with dense rainfall conditions 4 2 interception estimation and its variation after rainfall 4 2 1 estimation of e ic by the mec pt model to examine the reasonability of the g ic values generated by the mec pt model we further computed g ic g total corresponded to the ratio of e ic e t the relationships among e ic e t canopy conductance and rainfall are depicted as a scatterplot in fig 5 the e ic e t ratio ranges from 0 02 to 0 23 across land cover types cropland had the highest e ic e t values 0 15 0 23 and savanna had the lowest 0 02 0 10 among the three considered factors i e e ic e t g c and rainfall e ic e t had a positive relationship with both g c and rainfall magnitude at each land cover type at these sites an apparent pattern appeared e ic e t is proportional to rainfall volume and g c in this study the range of e ic e t estimated by the mec pt model varied in a large range but it matched the previously published e ic ratios of these areas wang erlandsson et al 2014 in wang erlandsson et al 2014 the e ic ratio ranged from 0 01 to more than 0 2 in the united states australia and western europe which were the locations of our study sites for example the mean e ic e t for cropland in this study 0 18 matched that in wang erlandsson et al 2014 0 17 and the lowest e ic ratios under 0 15 occurred in sparse vegetation such as savanna and grassland the large range of e ic e t across sites could be due to meteorological factors and the aerodynamic resistance of vegetative structures in different regions deguchi et al 2006 in the relationships among e ic e t g c and rainfall a positive association underlines the physical justification for the mec pt model partition of g total into g soil g ic and g c the controlling factor of g c is plant stomata so a higher g c revealed a denser canopy supporting a larger surface layer of intercepted water this point will be discussed in more detail in sections 4 2 2 and 4 3 1 4 2 2 variation of estimated e ic water for the interception process is provided primarily by rainfall and vegetation coverage is the surface layer for intercepted water capacity and evaporation zheng and jia 2020 in this study dew is assumed to influence the magnitude of e ic therefore to assess the variation of e ic in non rainfall conditions the e ic e t estimated by the mec pt model was first multiplied by the observed et to achieve the e ic volume then the dew point temperature t dew was calculated following allen et al 1998 to investigate the occurrence of dew fig 6 depicts the change in daily e ic after rainfall and dew formation at four sites with different land cover types as shown in fig 6 e ic increased immediately after each rainfall event at all sites followed by reductions with varying tendencies the e ic rate was proportional to time since the last rainfall event differently across land cover types the largest increment in e ic occurred at the au cum forest site reaching 0 54 mm day 1 which was roughly 5 times larger than the smallest increase at us ton savanna of about 0 10 mm day 1 the au dap grassland site exhibited an increase in e ic magnitude 0 39 mm day 1 similar to that at us arm cropland 0 38 mm day 1 also ndvi exhibited a positive relationship with e ic at all four sites during these periods at us ton e ic decreased rapidly right after the slight increment approaching 0 and remaining low during the period without rainfall in contrast the three other sites experienced a steady reduction in e ic after rainfall and e ic remained relatively large fluctuating slightly in non rainfall or insignificant rainfall conditions as can be seen from the bar chart showing the maximum value of rh r h max the variation in r h max was in line with the change in e ic at each site which varied randomly and reached the highest point on rainy days at au dap au cum and us arm r h max remained higher than 90 for most of the study duration in addition t min was regularly lower than the t dew at the four sites fig 6 overall the different trends in e ic variation across sites can be attributed to differences in vegetation layers the interception amount was primarily affected by the structure of the surface canopy via the water storage ability of vegetation dietz et al 2006 fathizadeh et al 2017 nonetheless notable e ic amounts occurred together with abundant rainfall in dense vegetation and vice versa zheng and jia 2020 explaining the variable increases in e ic with rainfall at the four sites also differences in vegetative characteristics could affect the time to evaporate e ic for instance canopies in forest ecosystems could take longer to dry than a savanna ecosystem even when the e ic volume is the same additionally deguchi et al 2006 reported that e ic was driven not only by vegetative structure but also by climatic conditions in different regions thus it is necessary to consider meteorological drivers in this process for each land cover type in agreement with crockford and richardson 2000 drawing general conclusions about interception losses is difficult for particular land cover types due to variations in rainfall type and climatic conditions this explains the non systematic proportions for the e ic rate and time after each rainfall event at the four sites next the assumption of dew occurrence during periods without rainfall was validated dew which is a potential water source in arid and semi arid areas can exceed rainfall volumes in these environments agam and berliner 2006 therefore it is vital to consider dew occurrence when assessing e ic the primary condition for dew is a surface temperature less than or equal to t dew agam and berliner 2006 and canopy leaves might be excessively wet after dew at rh above 90 thompson 1981 consequently interception of non rainfall conditions by plants is associated with dew formation andrade 2003 explaining the variation in e ic amount at the four sites on non rainy days the results of the mec pt algorithm could reflect the involvement of dew through the application of f sm with respect to dt not surprisingly yao et al 2013 reported that f sm was in good agreement with rh emphasizing the efficient performance of the mec pt model in partitioning et based on the conductance fractions 4 3 estimates of et partitioning next to prove the results from the mec pt model the mean proportion of each et component estimated by the mec pt model was compared with that by the m order for each land cover type savanna grassland forest and cropland in section 4 3 1 the mean t et values from proposed model were further discussed for each biome in section 4 3 2 4 3 1 comparison of et components the mec pt model vs the m order model the mec pt model was used to partition et into e soil e ic and t whereas the m order model separates et into only e soil and t lacking a contribution from e ic to assess the efficiency of these two et partitioning models fig 7 compares the proportion of average annual et components estimated by the mec pt and m order models for different land cover types the pie charts in fig 7 indicate that the discrepancies between et components estimated by the proposed mec pt method and the original m order model vary across land cover types in savanna the proportions of t and e soil estimated by these two models did not differ much due to the small e ic estimated by the mec pt model table 1 shows that rainfall and ndvi averages were usually low in this land cover type explaining the slight e ic amount additionally low rainfall frequency required the removal of a few data points during and after rainfall in the m order model ensuring similar data density between the two models table 2 in grassland t estimated by the two models were comparable with each other however the mec pt model showed lower e soil than that of the m order the lower e soil estimate in the mec pt model potentially resulted from relatively high e ic in this model precisely rainfall at grassland sites was greater than at savanna sites table 1 but the ndvi average remained low therefore the e ic that the mec pt model generated in grassland was greater than that in savanna but the estimated t from the two methods was similar this phenomenon explains the values produced by the mec pt model which includes ndvi in its estimation in forest the estimates of t and e soil by the mec pt model differed dramatically from those of the m order model this remarkable discrepancy might be a response to the high ndvi and abundant rainfall in this land cover type because canopy is considered a controlling factor in et separation scanlon and kustas 2012 its growth is frequently associated with increases in t and e ic due to the expansion of surface vegetation li et al 2018 an increase in canopy coverage is also accompanied by a decrease in e soil hu et al 2009 gu et al 2018 due to the lower solar radiation landing on the ground surface hungate et al 2002 for cropland the mec pt model predicted a higher t and a much lower e soil than those of the m order model along with the largest e ic in this biome this high percentage of e ic was partly affected by irrigation which plays a central role in crop water supply this result was in line with a report by dunne and leopold 1978 that the most important elements affecting e ic in cropland were irrigation intensity and crop density which were also associated with high t values by contrast the increase in e ic is regularly accompanied by a decrease in e soil due to the corresponding reduction in infiltration volume kozak et al 2007 chen et al 2014 4 3 2 t et variation as the aim of this study is to estimate the t et this section discussed the variation of t et estimated by the mec pt model across different ecosystems the t et results are depicted in fig 8 as the time series of t et at four sites and in fig s3 as box plots presenting the distribution of mean annual t et as shown in fig 8 us nr1 forest au dap grassland and us ne1 cropland exhibited significant differences in t et between the growing and non growing seasons whereas the magnitude of t et at the us ton savanna site fluctuated less seasonally t et at us ton normally varied from 0 3 to 0 6 during the non growing season and reached a peak of roughly 0 9 in the growing season indicating that t is a key controller of et in savanna at other sites the t et values remained at less than 0 5 during the non growing season and peaked rapidly during the growing season among land cover types the annual mean t et varied in a large range of 0 17 and 0 91 in which the highest ratio was observed in forest followed by savanna cropland and grassland fig s3 this large variation in t et was likely to due to variability in plant water use characteristic across the studied areas and the t et ratio can vary by studies in different land cover types wang et al 2014 therefore our predicted t et was compared with those of published findings in term of ecosystem table 3 the mec pt based t et ranges for savanna and grassland were consistent with those reported currently by ma et al 2020 for the same biomes using field measurement data the mean annual t et for savanna in this study is very close to a pt jpl model result gu et al 2018 and to a conclusion of compiling 81 partitioned et studies schlesinger and jasechko 2014 in forest the mec pt predictions for t et range were similar to published ranges of gu et al 2018 and ren et al 2019 for this ecosystem using the pt jpl model additionally the annual mean value of forest t et nearly matched the value reported by schlesinger and jasechko 2014 in cropland our predicted t et range was within the range of a crop coefficient method prediction yimam et al 2015 but our annual mean value for this ecosystem was slightly higher than that reported by gu et al 2018 thus our estimated t et at each ecosystem matched those from previous publications using other et partitioning techniques that also considered e ic in estimation however there are few publications using models partitioning et into t e soil and e ic to allow additional comparisons this helps construct a roadmap of where the proposed mec pt model is within the existing et partitioning methods and suggests the future direction for et partitioning model developments 4 4 sensitivity analysis of t et drivers to better understand the effects that climate drivers have on t et in the m order and mec pt models sensitivity analyses were performed in this study in the m order model the analysis was carried out using gpp ws t a and r n the same forcing variables along with ndvi and dt were examined for the mec pt model these forcing variables were changed 20 to investigate t et variations in the two models fig 9 provides the results of the sensitivity analyses at the 24 study sites across all land cover types as shown in fig 9 in terms of the relationships among the forcing inputs and t et in the two models higher gpp correlated with larger t et across all land cover types whereas inverse relationships were found between the other inputs and t et r n had the most sensitive effect on the t et estimate when using the m order model displaying a negative relationship that ranged from 10 to 10 in savanna and from 20 to 30 in grassland forest and cropland similarly for t et estimated using the mec pt model r n was the most sensitive factor across grassland cropland and savanna however ndvi was the most sensitive factor in forest where the t et estimated by the mec pt model ranged from 7 to 6 with a variation of 20 in ndvi the sensitivity results for gpp and t a were similar in both models at most land cover an increase or decrease of 20 in gpp and t a produced a change of more than 5 10 in the mec pt model and m order model based t et across all the land cover types except forest where gpp was more sensitive than t a for both models ws was the least sensitive factor in the m order model across all the land cover types whereas the least sensitivity in the mec pt model was seen for dt in savanna and ws in the other land covers overall t et values estimated by the two models showed different sensitivity orders for the m order model the order was r n g p p t a w s in savanna and forest and r n t a g p p w s in the other land cover types for the mec pt model the order was r n g p p t a n d v i w s d t in savanna r n g p p t a n d v i d t w s in grassland ndvi r n g p p d t t a w s in forest and r n n d v i g p p t a d t w s in cropland based on these results r n was found to hold a significant position in both models across all land cover types r n was the most sensitive factor in the two models for estimating total et followed by other environmental elements hwang and choi 2013 yao et al 2015 hao et al 2019 large values of r n tended to increase total et and then decrease the t et ratio t et was sensitive to changes in gpp because both techniques assumed that g c was related primarily to photosynthesis and gpp in the mec pt model ndvi also exhibited a strong effect on t et especially in forested areas which was consistent with previous findings scanlon and kustas 2012 wang et al 2014 because t correlates directly with vegetation activity that is could be presented by vegetation indexes via their potential to monitor canopy dynamics and ecosystem variability continuously under environmental changes ferreira et al 2003 zhang et al 2003 t a and ws did not play significant roles in t et in either the mec pt or m order model this was in line with the reports of thornthwaite 1948 and donohue et al 2010 in which these factors were the primary influence in the evaporation process therefore t a and ws indirectly affect the t et ratio 5 conclusion the main objective of this study was to propose an ecosystem conductance method by combining the ms pt and m order models for partitioning et into soil interception and canopy contributions by using datasets from 24 flux tower sites the total ecosystem conductance was first computed by coupling the aerodynamic conductance to the surface conductance which were converted from the related resistance the total ecosystem conductance was then separated into soil interception and canopy domains by using a non linear regression method based on the m order model the separated components generated from the proposed model were calculated to further investigate the e ic e t and t et ratios when compared to the original m order model the primary improvement of the mec pt model is ability to include data during rainy and wet condition to reflect interception this builded the better continuty of data in the mec pt model addressing the data gap associated with the m order model during these conditions the partitioned interception evaporation increases significantly after each rainfall pulse however the evaporation of the intercepted water proportions differently to the time since last rainfall event in each land cover type also dew can form under non rainfall conditions and create a meaningful amount of interception evaporation depending on the canopy structural and climatic characteristics of a region as the dominant contribution to et is transpiration this study found that t et ratio was highest in forests 0 72 0 17 followed by savanna 0 51 0 11 cropland 0 48 0 10 and grassland 0 39 0 17 in addition the dependence of t et on meteorological and environmental factors was clarified by carrying out sensitivity analyses r n played a central role in controlling the variation of t et over land cover types whereas t et was not highly dependent on climatic drivers such as wind speed or air temperature this study offers new insight into evapotranspiration partitioning with support from our proposed model based fractions of total ecosystem conductance therefore it can improve the prediction of hydrology cycles and promote sustainable development for

evaporation e soil canopy interception evaporation e ic and transpiration t yields both comprehensive insight into hydrological processes and better water management but it is challenging this study proposes a modified ecosystem conductance based priestley taylor mec pt algorithm for et partitioning based on the total ecosystem conductance g total fractions of soil interception and canopy datasets from 24 flux towers around the world were used to estimate g total by coupling aerodynamic conductance and surface conductance g s results from the mec pt model were compared with those from an original best fit ecosystem level conductance m order model that only partitions g s into soil and canopy domains the superior performance of the mec pt model with the inclusion of an intercepted contributor and ability to fill the data gap associated with the m order during wet conditions describes the robustness of this approach for partitioning et the mec pt model results might reflect dew formation that produces minimal e ic volume under non rainfall conditions with support from the diurnal temperature dt presence the ratio of t to total et t et was found highest in forest with 0 72 0 17 of standard deviation followed by savanna 0 57 0 11 cropland 0 48 0 10 and grassland 0 39 0 17 also sensitivity analysis was conducted with main input variables of the mec pt and m order models over four land cover types and the whole study period of each site used in this study the results demonstrated that in general conditions net radiation was the key driver controlling t et variations whereas air temperature and wind speed indirectly and slightly affected t et this study underlines that the inclusion of e ic might bridge the gap in knowledge about et and its components regarding canopy dynamics and ecosystem behaviors in the context of climate change keywords evapotranspiration partitioning total ecosystem conductance interception evaporation t et gpp 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is a key component of the earth s hydrological system and surface energy balance jung et al 2010 wang and dickinson 2012 with an annual return of more than 60 of global precipitation back into the atmosphere and consumption of latent heat which accounts for more than 50 of global solar radiation burba and verma 2005 trenberth 2009 mu et al 2011 et is described as the process returning water to the atmosphere via plant transpiration t and evaporation from both soil e soil and intercepted water from wet leaves and surfaces e ic kool et al 2014 t was reported as the major component of et in most previous studies which demonstrated a significant role of t in yearly rainfall sutanto et al 2014 however the accurate quantification of its magnitude is challenging as an example jasechko et al 2013 attributed approximately 80 90 of terrestrial et to t using isotopic analysis with a global dataset over a large lakes and rivers network the results from an integrated hydrologic simulation coupling vegetation and lateral ground flow suggested that t accounted for two thirds of global et maxwell and condon 2016 more recently lian et al 2018 concluded that the mean global transpired fraction of et is 62 6 based on an emergent constraint integrating cmip5 earth system models similarly the ratio of esoil to et is unclear possibly because of the methodological assumptions for example good et al 2015 found that mean global e soil predicted using the large scale water isotope method amounted to 65 of et whereas wei et al 2017 using regression equations without consideration of e ic yielded a zonally averaged e soil as low as 25 this proportion might also be larger in agricultural areas due to irrigation aouade et al 2016 eic is likely to range from 10 to 22 under different conditions in one study it normally contributed around 12 to annual et but could account for more than 20 in the rainy season raz yaseef et al 2012 this high proportion emphasizes that eic plays an undeniable role in et the broad variation in the relative size of these components highlights our poor understanding of et partitioning in surface water balance and motivates more studies related to et contributors a review of 52 et partitioning publications by kool et al 2014 found that these studies tended to ignore the intercepted component and considered it as a residual of two others failing to take interception flux into account when partitioning et might lead to a different proportion of t sutanto et al 2012 in et which is denoted as t et accurate assessments of t et are needed to improve our knowledge of et components as well as their influence on surface hydrological cycles and their variation under changing environmental conditions miralles et al 2011 therefore et partitioning models have been developed from the perspective of comprehensive t et assessment fisher et al 2008 yao et al 2013 yao et al 2015 for example the priestley taylor jet propulsion laboratory model pt jpl was introduced by fisher et al 2008 to estimate et as the sum of t e soil and e ic et t e soil e ic this method does not require calibration tuning or spin ups and it can be validated directly against eddy flux measurements fisher et al 2008 however the pt jpl model requires complex satellite based estimation of relative humidity rh and vapor pressure deficit vpd for constraining soil evaporation yao et al 2013 therefore yao et al 2013 proposed a modified satellite based priestley taylor ms pt model that measures et as the sum of four contributors t saturated soil evaporation e s wet soil surface evaporation ews and eic et t e s e ws e ic to avoid the limitations of the pt jpl model the ms pt algorithm uses diurnal temperature dt derived from air temperature t a or land surface temperature instead of rh and vpd in its soil moisture constraint estimates the ms pt algorithm requires only four key input parameters net radiation r n t a dt and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi thus only the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis product is used to provide ndvi decreasing the complexity compared with the pt jpl model other meteorological variables i e r n t a and dt can be retrieved from either satellite yao et al 2013 or eddy covariance flux towers yao et al 2017 for the ms pt algorithm however when using ground observed data significant discrepancies were found between ground truth et and estimated et due to inhibition of the parameterization schemes for soil evaporation constraints in the ms pt algorithm yao et al 2017 in addition the separate equations for each et component are accompanied by structural complexities that are likely to produce inaccuracies when processing an et partitioning model leading to imprecise t et results to improve the accuracy of t et and simplify the model partitioning process high frequency fluxnet data have been used to design et partitioning methods based on the theory that e and t are driven by different environmental factors t is purely associated with plants via photosynthesis and is a key influence on et separation whereas e depends primarily on soil and environmental factors therefore shuttleworth and wallace 1985 developed a dual source et method based on a combination theory that couples conception of the bulk stomatal resistance with one of the surface resistance using the penman monteith pm equation penman 1948 monteith 1965 the pm equation was applied here due to its ability to analyze evaporation from surfaces of a closed vegetation cover and of bare substrate shuttleworth and wallace 1985 subsequently as the inverse of surface resistance r s is surface conductance g s shuttleworth and wallace 1985 first partitioned g s into vegetation conductance g c and soil conductance g soil and then separated t and evaporation e based on that perspective lin et al 2018 introduced a best fit ecosystem level conductance m order model that combines empirical and optimal techniques to derive stomatal conductance medlyn et al 2011 leuning 1995 using hourly fluxnet data the m order model characterizes the features of ecosystem conductance and describes how it varies under different vpd and soil moisture conditions also the estimated ecosystem level conductance from this best fit model includes both soil and vegetation portions because it represents the conductance of soil surface along with vapor flow via stomata openings and total leaf area which has the potential to partition et into related components in that way li et al 2019 used the m order model to separate gs into gsoil and gc in an effort to compute t et gsoil and gc retrieved from the m order model were primarily data constrained which was different from the parameterization driven methods used by the other two source approaches however to avoid interception from wet plants this approach requires data elimination during and after rainfall together with data at rh greater than 95 accordingly frequent rainfall events might cause issues with data availability which apparently lead to inaccuracy indeed li et al 2019 reported that fewer data points can result in larger uncertainty when using the m order model generally the ms pt algorithm provides adequate estimations of et contributors but it performs inefficiently when using flux measurement data and involves elaborate calculations although the m order model might perform effectively and simply by adopting that dataset it does not include an interception contribution in the estimation therefore we propose a modified ecosystem conductance based priestley taylor mec pt model that combines the advantages of the two earlier models to separate et into soil interception and canopy contributions with the inclusion of interception the aerodynamic conductance g a was considered along with g s in this study due to its description of conductance from the canopy layer upward and its involvement in the land atmosphere interactions allen et al 1998 accordingly the sum of g a and g s was specified as the total ecosystem conductance g total which integrates all conductance across the entire path from leaf and soil surfaces to the overlying air then g total was partitioned into g soil g c and g ic by conducting the proposed mec pt model to further compute t et in comparison with the m order model the major improvements of the mec pt models are the measurement of the g ic together with the presence of the aerodynamic conductance our primary objectives in this study are 1 to partition et into e soil e ic and t by separating the related conductance 2 to investigate e ic variations after rainfall pulses and during non rainfall conditions using the mec pt model 3 to examine variations in the t et estimated by the mec pt model across land cover types and 4 to understand the roles of meteorological and environmental factors in t et by running sensitivity analyses with the m order and mec pt models the inclusion of e ic in et partitioning models that use ecosystem conductance might improve our understanding of canopy dynamics and ecosystem processes that control et as well as their respective drivers enabling better water management 2 flux towers and remote sensing datasets to measure total ecosystem conductance using the pm framework the selected sites had to include micrometeorological variables such as t a r n vpd rh p and wind speed ws together with other mandatory meteorological parameters other energy components such as latent heat flux le ground heat flux g and sensible heat flux h were also required gross primary productivity gpp which is computed based the nighttime respiration partitioning method by the fluxnet community is especially important in this dataset therefore half hourly eddy flux datasets from 24 sites around the world were retrieved with most sites located in australia and north america https fluxnet fluxdata org detail information of these sites is provided in fig 1 and table 1 we split the sites into four land cover categories cropland grassland savanna and forest data were screened and subjected to quality control to select data points that meet the requirements of our ecosystem conductance model first we excluded data with incoming shortwave radiation lower than 50 w m 2 and sensible heat smaller than 5 w m 2 to ignore the stable status of the boundary layer as it can restrict the performance of conductance measurement allen et al 1998 second negative gpp et and vpd were removed third to weaken the effect of random noise half hourly data were converted into six hourly data the data availability for each study site after applying these three filters is given in table 2 compared to the original m order model the major differences in screening data procedure for the mec pt model were 1 retaining data during and after a rainfall pulse and 2 processing data with rh exceeding 95 to reflect the e ic of wet canopy the mod13 product line was launched with a series of vegetation index components using nasa s modis sensor along with ndvi and an enhanced vegetation index in this study ndvi with a temporal resolution of 16 days and a spatial resolution of 1 km was retrieved from the mod13a2 product downloaded from https e4ftl01 cr usgs gov molt mod13a2 006 the study duration of the mod13a2 product was the same as that for each eddy flux tower the spatial coverages of the mod13a2 product covered the locations of the 24 flux tower sites 3 methodology 3 1 partitioning framework 3 1 1 total ecosystem conductance g total based on an inverted penman monteith equation g total was estimated by inverting the pm equation penman 1948 monteith 1965 using climatological variables from the fluxnet dataset 1 g total g a γ l e δ r n g l e g a ρ c p v p d a where γ is a psychrometric constant kpa c 1 g a is aerodynamic conductance m s 1 le is latent heat

d a is the vapor pressure deficit of the atmosphere kpa an algorithm for g a was described in lin et al 2018 in this equation the unit for g total was originally m s 1 but it was converted to mol m 2 s 1 using the ideal gas law for consistency with the unit of ecosystem conductance pearcy et al 1989 li et al 2019 in addition g total values can be seen as outliers and excluded if they range outside the 5th or 95th percentile detailed information for inverting the pm equation can be found in appendix b 1 next considering a report from knauer 2018 that climatic conditions at the surface of the canopy are physiologically more sensitive than those in the atmospheric layer above the vegetation the inverted leaf level vpd v p d l was used instead of vp d a in the ecosystem conductance models lin et al 2018 li et al 2019 vp d l was defined based on the theory of leaf scale vpd such that on the leaf surface e s t leaf e a where t leaf is the temperature on the surface of the leaf e s t leaf is the saturation of vapor pressure at t leaf and e a is the vapor pressure of the air lin et al 2018 found that vp d l was more effective in describing ecosystem conductance mechanisms and in

as the sum of e s and e ws e soil e s e ws accordingly we propose a ratio between e soil and e ic denoted as r sie to assess the relationship between them e ic 1 r sie e soil the equation conducting r

other parameters are provided in appendix d 3 1 3 conductance partitioning in previous studies lin et al 2018 and li et al 2019 removed data during and after rainfall together with data from periods when rh exceeded 95 to ignore the interception contribution in this study we retained all data during and after rain as well as during wet conditions to reflect the contribution of g ic also considering the coupling between the surface of the canopy and the atmosphere which results in a large rate of evaporation from wet canopy g a is added to g s here to produce g total as such g total which is measured with an inverted pm equation can be described as 6 g total g soil g ic g c to partition g total into separate components we modified the m order model into a new ecosystem conductance model the mec pt model the m order model was introduced by lin et al 2018 based on leuning s method leuning 1995 and medlyn s method medlyn et al 2011 and was used to assess the variation of g s at different ecosystem scales by detecting the best fit parameters of the vpd exponent m g s g 0 g 1 gpp vp d l m from that generalization li et al 2019 partitioned g s into two domains by decomposing g soil g 0 and g c g 1 gpp vp d l m corresponding to e soil and t respectively however that technique is limited by the significant lack of a g ic component to overcome that limitation we introduce the mec pt model to partition g total into g soil g ic and g c with support from the r sie ratio inferred by the ms pt algorithm which presents the relationship between g soil and g ic the equation for g total in the mec pt model becomes 7 g total g 0 g 0 1 r sie g 1 gpp vp d l m where g 0 mol m 2 s 1 g 1 kpam mol µmol 1 and m are fitted parameters and gpp is gross primary productivity µmol m 2 s 1 for the exponent of vp d l leuning 1995 and medlyn et al 2011 used fixed values of 1 and 0 5 respectively for all study sites however lin et al 2018 found that using variable exponents of vp d l by site is more effective than using a fixed exponent for all sites to describe the characteristic of canopy conductance and its dependence on vpd in each study area therefore in this study the exponent of vp d l in eq 7 m was varied across sites to the best fit value a non linear regression using ordinary least squares ols was applied to determine the fitted parameter g 0 g 1 and m for each site table s1 provides the fitted parameters used for each site in this study in the following frameworks of separation it was assumed that only g c is relevant to photosynthesis and gpp is used here as a variable expressing that process in terms of an ecosystem conductance model accordingly g c is reflected only by g 1 gpp vp d l m which is proportional to gpp g 0 might reflect both g soil and minimum g c as noted by lin et al 2018 nevertheless compared with e soil the minimum g c is inconsequential because it expresses only epidermal and cuticular losses even in extremely arid environments lin et al 2015 medlyn et al 2017 g ic is here obtained by using the relationship between e soil and e ic therefore g ic is driven by g 0 and r sie as a result g total was finally partitioned into g soil g ic and g c 8 g soil g 0 9 g ic g 0 1 r sie 10 g c g 1 gpp vp d l m 3 1 4 evapotranspiration partitioning thus et can be partitioned into e soil e ic and t as shown in fig s1 first the pm model indicates terrestrial resistance as a single source structure fig s1a second in the shuttleworth wallace model terrestrial resistance is treated as a dual parallel source similar to g soil and g c fig s1b which was applied to partition et in the m order model third in the mec pt model introduced here total resistance is separated into three parallel resistances that correspond to g soil g ic and g c fig s1c based on the et partitioning concept of the ms pt model accordingly the entire et can be partitioned using flux conservation theory li et al 2019 as follows 11 et r total e ic r ic e soil r

and t et is always equal to 1 a flowchart illustrating the study framework is provided in fig 2 and the equations of the mec pt model are summarized in appendix b 2 3 2 the m order model to compare and examine the performance of the mec pt model we used another ecosystem conductance model the m order model g s g 0 g 1 gpp vp d l m in that approach data from the 24 flux towers were handled in a manner similar to that of the mec pt model however data during and within six hours after rainfall together with data when rh exceeded 95 were removed to ignore g ic the ols method was also used in non linear regression to achieve fitted values g 0 g 1 m that were then used to determine g soil and g c details can be found in li et al 2019 and appendix c 3 3 criteria evaluations to examine the performance of the ecosystem conductance models statistical comparison metrics such as index of agreement ioa and root mean square error rmse were exploited ioa explains the degree of match between observed and modeled values and it varies from 0 to 1 willmott et al 2012 baik and choi 2015 rmse is the standard deviation of the predicted uncertainties and is used to investigate the concentration of data which is around the line of best fit barnston 1992 in this study higher ioa demonstrates better agreement between estimated values and observed ones while lower rmse means that modeled values are closer to observed values the equations for these statistical evaluations are as follows 15 ioa 1 i 1 n m i o i 2 n n m i o o i o 2 0 ioa 1 16 rmse i 1 n m i o i 2 n where m i and o i are the values estimated by models and the observation n is the total number of data during studied period i presents for ith number of samples o is the mean of observation 4 results and discussion in this study the mec pt model was run with a dataset from 24 flux tower sites and those sites were divided into four land cover categories savanna grassland forest and cropland to examine the performance of the mec pt model the g total estimated by mec pt is validated against that from the inverted pm equation in section 4 1 because the observation of g total was not provided in the eddy covariance data section 4 2 proves the reasonability of the e ic et results given by the mec pt model and analyzes the effects of rainfall and dew formation on e ic in an effort to partition et the results for the et components given by the mec pt model are further discussed in section 4 3 finally because the dominant component of et is t the dependence of t et on meteorological and environmental factors is investigated by conducting sensitivity analyses with both the mec pt and m order models the results of the sensitivity analyses are illustrated in section 4 4 4 1 comparisons of ecosystem conductance 4 1 1 comparison the mec pt model vs the inverted pm equation the g total estimated from the pm equation was considered as the observed g total following li et al 2019 to investigate the performance of the mec pt approach we compared the g total estimated by the mec pt model with that from the inverted pm equation as a time series and in bar charts fig 3 a ioa and rmse were applied as evaluation criteria for this comparison fig 3b as shown in fig 3a the g total estimated by the mec pt model and observations inverted pm equation differed little throughout the study period at the us ton site also comparable variations were seen in ndvi and g total to examine the performance of the mec pt model at other sites ioa and rmse were applied to the results from all the studied sites fig 3b good agreement was observed between g total from the mec pt and the pm models for most land cover types the best performance was exhibited in savanna with a higher ioa ranging from 0 77 to 0 96 and lower rmse 0 01 0 04 mol m 2 s 1 than in the other land cover types forest on the other hand had the worst performance with an ioa ranging from 0 57 to 0 88 and rmse from 0 05 to 0 28 mol m 2 s 1 performance for cropland was stable with an ioa of around 0 70 and rmse of roughly 0 17 mol m 2 s 1 in general the mec pt model based g total did not differ much from that of the inverted pm equation although interception is included in the proposed algorithm the proposed model showed good results with a high mean ioa of 0 76 and a low mean rmse of 0 11 mol m 2 s 1 across all study sites this match between the two g total values confirms the validity of the mec pt model which combines the ms pt algorithm and m order model to partition total ecosystem conductance besides the similar pattern in ndvi and g total indicates that ndvi has the potential to be a controlling factor in ecosystem conductance models therefore the application of ndvi in the estimates was expected to reflect the characteristics of the vegetation layer in the studied areas potentially predicting reliable t et ratios ferreira et al 2003 zhang et al 2003 4 1 2 evaluation of g c by the mec pt and m order models the g c estimated by the mec pt model was compared with that produced by the m order model to further examine the performance of the mec pt model the g c values computed by both models for all 24 flux tower sites are shown as a scatterplot in fig 4 and the values from two sites with different rainfall conditions are shown as time series data in fig s2 as shown in the scatterplot fig 4 the magnitude of g c estimated by the mec pt model was consistent with that estimated by the m order model at savanna and grassland sites however the mec pt model produced varied g c estimates in highly vegetated area especially forest sites where had significantly greater g c a further comparison between the g c calculated using the two methods is shown as a time series for the us ton savanna and ca gro forest sites fig s2 the us ton site where rainfall density was sparse shows the similarity between the two modeled g c values by contrast rainfall at ca gro was much denser than at the us ton site the mec pt model perform results for the many rainy days i e in periods shaded with the light green color in us ton site whereas the m order model lacked results under those conditions therefore compared to the m order model the mec pt model exhibited better continuity of data for this site the differences in magnitudes of g c estimated by the mec pt and m order models varied by land cover type the mec pt model produced magnitudes of g c equivalent to those of the m order model for the savanna and grassland sites because vegetation coverage remained sparse in those types of land cover with the low ndvi table 1 incorporating ndvi into the mec pt estimates did not create a notable difference between the two g c values also the low rainfall density in those biomes table 1 did not generate a significant discrepancy in the amount of data processed by the mec pt and m order models table 2 conversely the different g c estimated by the mec pt model in cropland and forest were attributed to the effect of higher ndvi representing denser vegetation coverage in these biomes table 1 this demonstrates that including ndvi in the mec pt model better describes the canopy status for each land cover type also the higher g c estimations of the mec pt model occurred at several forest sites might be because of both their dense vegetation and the frequent rainfall for example wang erlandsson et al 2014 found that 45 of annual global mean t occurred within three hours after a rainfall event therefore the mec pt model predicted higher g c partly because it used data from rainy and wet conditions allowing it to reflect the entirety of t as can be seen in table 2 these two models used different amounts of data for each site after screening the data to meet their requirements the mec pt model was regularly processed with a higher number of data points than the m order model at each site this underlined that the mec pt model was able to bridge the data gap associated with the m order model on rainy days with dense rainfall conditions 4 2 interception estimation and its variation after rainfall 4 2 1 estimation of e ic by the mec pt model to examine the reasonability of the g ic values generated by the mec pt model we further computed g ic g total corresponded to the ratio of e ic e t the relationships among e ic e t canopy conductance and rainfall are depicted as a scatterplot in fig 5 the e ic e t ratio ranges from 0 02 to 0 23 across land cover types cropland had the highest e ic e t values 0 15 0 23 and savanna had the lowest 0 02 0 10 among the three considered factors i e e ic e t g c and rainfall e ic e t had a positive relationship with both g c and rainfall magnitude at each land cover type at these sites an apparent pattern appeared e ic e t is proportional to rainfall volume and g c in this study the range of e ic e t estimated by the mec pt model varied in a large range but it matched the previously published e ic ratios of these areas wang erlandsson et al 2014 in wang erlandsson et al 2014 the e ic ratio ranged from 0 01 to more than 0 2 in the united states australia and western europe which were the locations of our study sites for example the mean e ic e t for cropland in this study 0 18 matched that in wang erlandsson et al 2014 0 17 and the lowest e ic ratios under 0 15 occurred in sparse vegetation such as savanna and grassland the large range of e ic e t across sites could be due to meteorological factors and the aerodynamic resistance of vegetative structures in different regions deguchi et al 2006 in the relationships among e ic e t g c and rainfall a positive association underlines the physical justification for the mec pt model partition of g total into g soil g ic and g c the controlling factor of g c is plant stomata so a higher g c revealed a denser canopy supporting a larger surface layer of intercepted water this point will be discussed in more detail in sections 4 2 2 and 4 3 1 4 2 2 variation of estimated e ic water for the interception process is provided primarily by rainfall and vegetation coverage is the surface layer for intercepted water capacity and evaporation zheng and jia 2020 in this study dew is assumed to influence the magnitude of e ic therefore to assess the variation of e ic in non rainfall conditions the e ic e t estimated by the mec pt model was first multiplied by the observed et to achieve the e ic volume then the dew point temperature t dew was calculated following allen et al 1998 to investigate the occurrence of dew fig 6 depicts the change in daily e ic after rainfall and dew formation at four sites with different land cover types as shown in fig 6 e ic increased immediately after each rainfall event at all sites followed by reductions with varying tendencies the e ic rate was proportional to time since the last rainfall event differently across land cover types the largest increment in e ic occurred at the au cum forest site reaching 0 54 mm day 1 which was roughly 5 times larger than the smallest increase at us ton savanna of about 0 10 mm day 1 the au dap grassland site exhibited an increase in e ic magnitude 0 39 mm day 1 similar to that at us arm cropland 0 38 mm day 1 also ndvi exhibited a positive relationship with e ic at all four sites during these periods at us ton e ic decreased rapidly right after the slight increment approaching 0 and remaining low during the period without rainfall in contrast the three other sites experienced a steady reduction in e ic after rainfall and e ic remained relatively large fluctuating slightly in non rainfall or insignificant rainfall conditions as can be seen from the bar chart showing the maximum value of rh r h max the variation in r h max was in line with the change in e ic at each site which varied randomly and reached the highest point on rainy days at au dap au cum and us arm r h max remained higher than 90 for most of the study duration in addition t min was regularly lower than the t dew at the four sites fig 6 overall the different trends in e ic variation across sites can be attributed to differences in vegetation layers the interception amount was primarily affected by the structure of the surface canopy via the water storage ability of vegetation dietz et al 2006 fathizadeh et al 2017 nonetheless notable e ic amounts occurred together with abundant rainfall in dense vegetation and vice versa zheng and jia 2020 explaining the variable increases in e ic with rainfall at the four sites also differences in vegetative characteristics could affect the time to evaporate e ic for instance canopies in forest ecosystems could take longer to dry than a savanna ecosystem even when the e ic volume is the same additionally deguchi et al 2006 reported that e ic was driven not only by vegetative structure but also by climatic conditions in different regions thus it is necessary to consider meteorological drivers in this process for each land cover type in agreement with crockford and richardson 2000 drawing general conclusions about interception losses is difficult for particular land cover types due to variations in rainfall type and climatic conditions this explains the non systematic proportions for the e ic rate and time after each rainfall event at the four sites next the assumption of dew occurrence during periods without rainfall was validated dew which is a potential water source in arid and semi arid areas can exceed rainfall volumes in these environments agam and berliner 2006 therefore it is vital to consider dew occurrence when assessing e ic the primary condition for dew is a surface temperature less than or equal to t dew agam and berliner 2006 and canopy leaves might be excessively wet after dew at rh above 90 thompson 1981 consequently interception of non rainfall conditions by plants is associated with dew formation andrade 2003 explaining the variation in e ic amount at the four sites on non rainy days the results of the mec pt algorithm could reflect the involvement of dew through the application of f sm with respect to dt not surprisingly yao et al 2013 reported that f sm was in good agreement with rh emphasizing the efficient performance of the mec pt model in partitioning et based on the conductance fractions 4 3 estimates of et partitioning next to prove the results from the mec pt model the mean proportion of each et component estimated by the mec pt model was compared with that by the m order for each land cover type savanna grassland forest and cropland in section 4 3 1 the mean t et values from proposed model were further discussed for each biome in section 4 3 2 4 3 1 comparison of et components the mec pt model vs the m order model the mec pt model was used to partition et into e soil e ic and t whereas the m order model separates et into only e soil and t lacking a contribution from e ic to assess the efficiency of these two et partitioning models fig 7 compares the proportion of average annual et components estimated by the mec pt and m order models for different land cover types the pie charts in fig 7 indicate that the discrepancies between et components estimated by the proposed mec pt method and the original m order model vary across land cover types in savanna the proportions of t and e soil estimated by these two models did not differ much due to the small e ic estimated by the mec pt model table 1 shows that rainfall and ndvi averages were usually low in this land cover type explaining the slight e ic amount additionally low rainfall frequency required the removal of a few data points during and after rainfall in the m order model ensuring similar data density between the two models table 2 in grassland t estimated by the two models were comparable with each other however the mec pt model showed lower e soil than that of the m order the lower e soil estimate in the mec pt model potentially resulted from relatively high e ic in this model precisely rainfall at grassland sites was greater than at savanna sites table 1 but the ndvi average remained low therefore the e ic that the mec pt model generated in grassland was greater than that in savanna but the estimated t from the two methods was similar this phenomenon explains the values produced by the mec pt model which includes ndvi in its estimation in forest the estimates of t and e soil by the mec pt model differed dramatically from those of the m order model this remarkable discrepancy might be a response to the high ndvi and abundant rainfall in this land cover type because canopy is considered a controlling factor in et separation scanlon and kustas 2012 its growth is frequently associated with increases in t and e ic due to the expansion of surface vegetation li et al 2018 an increase in canopy coverage is also accompanied by a decrease in e soil hu et al 2009 gu et al 2018 due to the lower solar radiation landing on the ground surface hungate et al 2002 for cropland the mec pt model predicted a higher t and a much lower e soil than those of the m order model along with the largest e ic in this biome this high percentage of e ic was partly affected by irrigation which plays a central role in crop water supply this result was in line with a report by dunne and leopold 1978 that the most important elements affecting e ic in cropland were irrigation intensity and crop density which were also associated with high t values by contrast the increase in e ic is regularly accompanied by a decrease in e soil due to the corresponding reduction in infiltration volume kozak et al 2007 chen et al 2014 4 3 2 t et variation as the aim of this study is to estimate the t et this section discussed the variation of t et estimated by the mec pt model across different ecosystems the t et results are depicted in fig 8 as the time series of t et at four sites and in fig s3 as box plots presenting the distribution of mean annual t et as shown in fig 8 us nr1 forest au dap grassland and us ne1 cropland exhibited significant differences in t et between the growing and non growing seasons whereas the magnitude of t et at the us ton savanna site fluctuated less seasonally t et at us ton normally varied from 0 3 to 0 6 during the non growing season and reached a peak of roughly 0 9 in the growing season indicating that t is a key controller of et in savanna at other sites the t et values remained at less than 0 5 during the non growing season and peaked rapidly during the growing season among land cover types the annual mean t et varied in a large range of 0 17 and 0 91 in which the highest ratio was observed in forest followed by savanna cropland and grassland fig s3 this large variation in t et was likely to due to variability in plant water use characteristic across the studied areas and the t et ratio can vary by studies in different land cover types wang et al 2014 therefore our predicted t et was compared with those of published findings in term of ecosystem table 3 the mec pt based t et ranges for savanna and grassland were consistent with those reported currently by ma et al 2020 for the same biomes using field measurement data the mean annual t et for savanna in this study is very close to a pt jpl model result gu et al 2018 and to a conclusion of compiling 81 partitioned et studies schlesinger and jasechko 2014 in forest the mec pt predictions for t et range were similar to published ranges of gu et al 2018 and ren et al 2019 for this ecosystem using the pt jpl model additionally the annual mean value of forest t et nearly matched the value reported by schlesinger and jasechko 2014 in cropland our predicted t et range was within the range of a crop coefficient method prediction yimam et al 2015 but our annual mean value for this ecosystem was slightly higher than that reported by gu et al 2018 thus our estimated t et at each ecosystem matched those from previous publications using other et partitioning techniques that also considered e ic in estimation however there are few publications using models partitioning et into t e soil and e ic to allow additional comparisons this helps construct a roadmap of where the proposed mec pt model is within the existing et partitioning methods and suggests the future direction for et partitioning model developments 4 4 sensitivity analysis of t et drivers to better understand the effects that climate drivers have on t et in the m order and mec pt models sensitivity analyses were performed in this study in the m order model the analysis was carried out using gpp ws t a and r n the same forcing variables along with ndvi and dt were examined for the mec pt model these forcing variables were changed 20 to investigate t et variations in the two models fig 9 provides the results of the sensitivity analyses at the 24 study sites across all land cover types as shown in fig 9 in terms of the relationships among the forcing inputs and t et in the two models higher gpp correlated with larger t et across all land cover types whereas inverse relationships were found between the other inputs and t et r n had the most sensitive effect on the t et estimate when using the m order model displaying a negative relationship that ranged from 10 to 10 in savanna and from 20 to 30 in grassland forest and cropland similarly for t et estimated using the mec pt model r n was the most sensitive factor across grassland cropland and savanna however ndvi was the most sensitive factor in forest where the t et estimated by the mec pt model ranged from 7 to 6 with a variation of 20 in ndvi the sensitivity results for gpp and t a were similar in both models at most land cover an increase or decrease of 20 in gpp and t a produced a change of more than 5 10 in the mec pt model and m order model based t et across all the land cover types except forest where gpp was more sensitive than t a for both models ws was the least sensitive factor in the m order model across all the land cover types whereas the least sensitivity in the mec pt model was seen for dt in savanna and ws in the other land covers overall t et values estimated by the two models showed different sensitivity orders for the m order model the order was r n g p p t a w s in savanna and forest and r n t a g p p w s in the other land cover types for the mec pt model the order was r n g p p t a n d v i w s d t in savanna r n g p p t a n d v i d t w s in grassland ndvi r n g p p d t t a w s in forest and r n n d v i g p p t a d t w s in cropland based on these results r n was found to hold a significant position in both models across all land cover types r n was the most sensitive factor in the two models for estimating total et followed by other environmental elements hwang and choi 2013 yao et al 2015 hao et al 2019 large values of r n tended to increase total et and then decrease the t et ratio t et was sensitive to changes in gpp because both techniques assumed that g c was related primarily to photosynthesis and gpp in the mec pt model ndvi also exhibited a strong effect on t et especially in forested areas which was consistent with previous findings scanlon and kustas 2012 wang et al 2014 because t correlates directly with vegetation activity that is could be presented by vegetation indexes via their potential to monitor canopy dynamics and ecosystem variability continuously under environmental changes ferreira et al 2003 zhang et al 2003 t a and ws did not play significant roles in t et in either the mec pt or m order model this was in line with the reports of thornthwaite 1948 and donohue et al 2010 in which these factors were the primary influence in the evaporation process therefore t a and ws indirectly affect the t et ratio 5 conclusion the main objective of this study was to propose an ecosystem conductance method by combining the ms pt and m order models for partitioning et into soil interception and canopy contributions by using datasets from 24 flux tower sites the total ecosystem conductance was first computed by coupling the aerodynamic conductance to the surface conductance which were converted from the related resistance the total ecosystem conductance was then separated into soil interception and canopy domains by using a non linear regression method based on the m order model the separated components generated from the proposed model were calculated to further investigate the e ic e t and t et ratios when compared to the original m order model the primary improvement of the mec pt model is ability to include data during rainy and wet condition to reflect interception this builded the better continuty of data in the mec pt model addressing the data gap associated with the m order model during these conditions the partitioned interception evaporation increases significantly after each rainfall pulse however the evaporation of the intercepted water proportions differently to the time since last rainfall event in each land cover type also dew can form under non rainfall conditions and create a meaningful amount of interception evaporation depending on the canopy structural and climatic characteristics of a region as the dominant contribution to et is transpiration this study found that t et ratio was highest in forests 0 72 0 17 followed by savanna 0 51 0 11 cropland 0 48 0 10 and grassland 0 39 0 17 in addition the dependence of t et on meteorological and environmental factors was clarified by carrying out sensitivity analyses r n played a central role in controlling the variation of t et over land cover types whereas t et was not highly dependent on climatic drivers such as wind speed or air temperature this study offers new insight into evapotranspiration partitioning with support from our proposed model based fractions of total ecosystem conductance therefore it can improve the prediction of hydrology cycles and promote sustainable development for

4026,it is important to develop the integrated flood and landslide modeling system driven by radar and satellite to predict these hazards to mitigate their damages in this study we investigated the utility of the c band one polarization radar quantitative precipitation estimation qpe and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap satellite qpe for the integrated prediction of floods and landslides in two hilly basins of southern shaanxi province of china we further developed a dynamic bias correction to reduce uncertainty in radar and satellite qpes using gauge observations and explored the impacts of gauge density and spatial resolution of qpe on the effectiveness of bias correction our results show that the radar and gsmap qpes have respective large negative and positive biases the bias correction method has significantly improved the quality of both radar and gsmap qpes and the associated accuracies in the simulated hydrological processes and slope stability the bias correction method with a correction time interval of 24 h can achieve the optimal results for both radar and gsmap qpes although gauge density and spatial resolution impact the accuracy of the bias corrected methods for both radar and gsmap inclusion of the observations from even a small number of rain gauges will be helpful for reducing the uncertainty in the radar and satellite qpes 1 introduction rainfall induced flood and landslide hazards are destructive and harmful to both of human lives and infrastructure blöthe et al 2015 huang et al 2017 peruccacci et al 2012 globally economic losses caused by floods account for 30 40 of losses due to natural hazards during 1974 2003 guha sapir et al 2004 with the rapid growth of population and economy flood induced losses are becoming more and more severe chen et al 2021 he et al 2018 jonkman 2005 besides landslides are responsible for more than 1000 deaths and approximately 4 billion us dollars in property losses per year pradhan and youssef 2010 china is also severely affected by natural hazards including floods and landslides hong et al 2015 petley 2010 zhang et al 2019b the average property losses caused by flood are about 110 billion cny per year while the death is more than 5000 in recent years one study reports that landslide hazards have led to about 1100 fatalities and 5 10 billion us dollars since 2000 hong et al 2017 due to the massive fatalities and property losses caused by floods and landslides it is essential to develop the forecasting capacity of these hazards to reduce and further avoid the damages chen et al 2015 hydrological models for flood forecasting have developed from conceptual models burnash et al 1973 crawford and linsley 1966 sugawara et al 1984 to semi distributed models beven and kirkby 1979 duan and miller 1997 zhang et al 2021 and further to fully distributed models in the meantime landslide prediction has evolved from heuristic susceptibility approaches fookes 1997 griffiths 2002 griffiths and edwards 2001 guzzetti et al 2000 to empirical rainfall threshold models bogaard and greco 2018 caine 1980 glade et al 2000 guzzetti et al 2007 guzzetti et al 2008 and further to physically based slope stability models liao et al 2010 montrasio and valentino 2008 montrasio and valentino 2016a montrasio and valentino 2016b van asch et al 2007 wilkinson et al 2002 recently coupling the hydrological models with slope stability models he et al 2016 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2016 have been developed to predict flood and landside simultaneously because the concept of cascading hazards has drawn more and more attention hydrological models can provide more accurate and realistic estimations of hydrological processes and states for slope stability model e g rainfall infiltration and soil moisture which is proved to improve the predictive capability for the landslide hazards and extend the functionality of the hydrological models rainfall as a key forcing data of hydrological models and landslide models has a significant impact on flood forecasting and simulations of hydrological processes and hence landslide prediction therefore it is important to obtain rainfall data as accurate as possible usually rainfall data can be observed estimated by ground gauge stations weather radars and meteorological satellites different rainfall data sources have their advantages and disadvantages for representing spatiotemporal characteristics of actual rainfall processes gauge rainfall is usually treated as the true value of actual rainfall because it measures the rainfall that falls into the ground surface however gauge rainfall is a point level observation and has to represent the rainfall spatial variability through a network making its representation depending on station density and spatial distribution of stations moreover distributed hydrological and land surface models require gridded rainfall as forcing which requires interpolation of gauge rainfall leading to some new errors and uncertainties hughes 2006 renard et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 radar rainfall can detect the spatial distribution of rainfall over a large region and often has a high temporal resolution e g 6 min it is derived by constructing a quantitative relation between rainfall e g rainfall intensity and reflectivity krajewski and smith 2002 wilson and brandes 1979 therefore the accuracy of radar rainfall is directly influenced by the precipitation retrieval algorithms which are usually built based on the distribution of raindrop size or rainfall rate atlas et al 1990 in addition the accuracy of radar rainfall is also affected by terrain and vegetation cover because they can occlude the electromagnetic waves emitted by radar qi and zhang 2013 smith and krajewski 1991 the accuracy of radar rainfall may be low if the terrain is complex and vegetation is dense relative to radar satellites can cover a much larger area hsu et al 1997 similar to radar rainfall the relation between actual rainfall and reflectivity received by satellite is built through different retrieval algorithms griffith et al 1978 so far the common global satellite rainfall datasets include the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm kummerow et al 1998 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap of the global precipitation measurement gpm mission ushio et al 2003 climate prediction center morphing cmorph data joyce et al 2004 the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2019 and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hong et al 2005 among others which are based on different remote sensing sensors and retrieval algorithms however gauge corrected satellite rainfall is often substantially time lagged shen et al 2010 while near real time satellite rainfall has a low latency but a relatively high uncertainty as a result the above mentioned limitations often limit the utility of satellite rainfall for in particular real time flood forecasting of the small and medium sized basins wu and zhai 2012 gauge observations with automated quality control and reporting can overcome this shortcoming but it is usually unpractical to build dense gauge network for a large region in addition similar to near real time satellite rainfall gauge rainfall without automated quality control could be time lagged if quality control need be conducted to correct the potential systematic errors due to the biases in radar and satellite rainfall it is important to develop bias correction methods to improve the accuracy of radar and satellite rainfall data in recent years different bias correction methods have been developed for example cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 adopted the regression analysis and geographical differential analysis gda methods to calibrate the trmm rainfall based on gauge rainfall data and found that the rainfall calibrated by the gda method has a high accuracy chao et al 2018 proposed a bias correction method based on the mixed geographically weighted regression mgwr method for merging satellite and gauge rainfall in which the weights were determined by four different weighting functions the mgwr method improves the spatial resolution and quality of satellite rainfall and is valuable for hydrological modelling ma et al 2018b proposed a dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma scheme to blend multi satellite precipitation products providing a new solution for blending multi satellite rainfall data although the applicability and evaluation of radar and satellite precipitation products for flood simulation and prediction have been widely studied recently their applicability for landslide prediction and the prediction of rainfall triggered multiple hazards such as floods and landslides have not been well studied how to facilitate the integrated forecasting of flood and landslide hazards using the multi source rainfall estimates and how to improve the forecasting accuracy by reducing the uncertainty in the multi source rainfall estimates remain to be addressed therefore the objectives of this study are three fold 1 to investigate the utility of the c band quantitative precipitation estimation qpe from a radar of china new generation weather radar cinrad network and the gsmap satellite qpe of the gpm mission for integrated prediction of floods and landslides 2 to develop a dynamic bias correction to reduce uncertainty in radar and satellite qpes using gauge observations and 3 to explore the impacts of gauge density and spatial resolution of qpe on the effectiveness of bias correction to this end we first compared the radar and satellite qpes with the gauge observations and analyzed the uncertainties in these qpes we then developed a dynamic geographical differential analysis dgda method to correct the biases in the qpes finally we conducted the hydrological evaluation of the original and bias corrected qpes and quantified the impacts of different rainfall sources on the integrated flood landslide prediction simulation via the integrated coupled routing and excess storage and slope infiltration distributed equilibrium icreslide v2 0 model he et al 2016 wang et al 2020b 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area our study area is located in the shaanxi province of northwest china fig 1 a which frequently suffers from flood and landslide hazards the statistical report shows that rainfall induced landslide hazards occur frequently across shaanxi with more than 1 000 landslide events during 2009 2012 because of steep slopes in its many areas and heavy rainfall in the monsoon seasons may to october zhang et al 2019a study area in this study is a nested region with a bigger rectangular area shown in fig 1a and fig 1b ranging from 108 e to 110 e in longitude and from 31 n to 33 n in latitude and two basins fig 1b within the rectangular area within the rectangular area we compared the gauge rainfall with the radar and satellite qpes and analyzed the uncertainty in these qpes within the basins we conducted the icreslide simulations driven by the gauge observations and qpes to conduct the hydrological evaluation of qpes and evaluate the effectiveness of the dynamic bias correction method the two basins are located in southern shaanxi and include the ba river basin and lan river basin fig 1a the ba river basin is a tributary of the han river the largest tributary of the yangzi river and has an area of 2 069 km2 its elevation ranges from 222 to 2 473 m fig 1b and has an average slope of 22 8 fig 2 a the average channel gradient of the ba river is about 28 6 annual rainfall in this basin is about 700 900 mm of which summer july to september rainfall contributes for 40 60 soil type is mainly loam in this basin fig 2b while forests cover most of its lands accompanied by a few cultivated lands in the plain area fig 2c the lan river basin is also a tributary of the han river with an area of 1845 km2 elevation decreases from southeast to northwest which is similar to that of the ba river basin fig 1b the average slope is 26 5 fig 2d which is steeper than that of the ba river basin the lan river often experiences flash floods and has the recorded highest peak flood of 2 220 m3 s the spatial distribution of soil type in the lan river basin is similar to that in the ba river basin mainly the loam some soils classified as clay and sandy loam are distributed in the upper stream fig 2e forest is also the dominant land cover type while some cultivated lands are located along the river and some grasslands are in the upper stream fig 2f both of the basins are located within the humid climatic zone and the qinling mountain making them having abundant rainfall and steep terrains therefore floods and landslides often occur across the two basins it is essential and important to develop the prediction capacity of these hazards to reduce and further avoid the damages using the radar and satellite technologies 2 2 data the data used in this study include hourly rainfall rates from the gauge stations a cinrad weather radar and gsmap satellite products potential evapotranspiration pet digital elevation model dem soil type land cover type hourly stream flow records and landslide inventory to make data comparable and consistent on the spatial resolution all gridded data were interpolated or resampled to an identical spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km 30 arcsec rainfall data used in this study have three sources including gauge observations radar qpe and satellite qpe the hourly observed rainfall derived from 334 rain gauges fig 1b were interpolated into gridded data with a spatial resolution of 1 km via the ordinary kriging method krige 1951 the period of gauge rainfall is from 00 00utc sep 01 to 23 00utc oct 31 2017 i e 1464 time steps radar qpe was derived from the cinrad c band single polarization ankang radar with a radial resolution of 500 m and a detection range of 400 km which is located at 109 043 e and 32 693 n fig 1a the radar provided a continuous radar qpe product from 00 00utc sep 22 to 23 00utc oct 7 2017 the pre processing of radar qpe data is described in section 3 1 satellite rainfall data in this study were from the gsmap product gsmap gauge of the gpm mission which are adjusted by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation the source precipitation data of gsmap are obtained by the passive microwave and infrared radiometers retrieval algorithm based on the moving vector with the kalman filter approach the temporal resolution of the gsmap gauge data is 1 h which is averaged from sub hourly observations of the specified hour the data has a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 grid approximately 10 km at the equator with a coverage of 60 n to 60 s to make it comparable to the radar data these data are interpolated into a spatial resolution of 1 km through the bi linear interpolation method considering the common data availability we set the time between 00 00utc sep 01 2017 and 23 00utc sep 21 2017 as the calibration period and the rest period until 23 00utc oct 31 2017 as the validation period the pet data were retrieved from the hydrological gauge stations and also interpolated into the same grid based on the ordinary kriging method the dem data are from the geospatial data cloud with a spatial resolution of 90 m soil data are from the harmonized world soil database hwsd v1 2 which has a spatial resolution of 1 km and contains 13 soil types based on the united states department of agriculture usda classification the land cover type data are from the climate change initiative cci land cover project v2 0 the spatial resolution of this data is 300 m streamflow data are used to calibrate the icreslide model and are from the hydrological year book of the ministry of water resources china the landslide inventory data are from the geological survey office of the department of land and resources of shaanxi province with information on the landslide locations occurrence time and recorded economic losses in this study the rainfall and pet data are model forcing data while the dem soil type and land cover type are used to derive background information and model parameters such as flow direction flow accumulation slope angle soil water capacity saturate hydraulic conductivity soil cohesion porosity and friction angle stream flow discharge and landslide inventory data are for model evaluation 3 methodology 3 1 brief description of the radar qpe algorithm the ankang radar of the cinrad is a c band single polarization doppler weather radar we applied a well studied radar qpe algorithm to retrieve the rainfall rates based on the calibrated relationships between the radar echo intensity z and the precipitation rate r since both z and r are related to the diameter and number of precipitation particles based on this the conversion relationship between z and r can be established through the drop size distribution dsd of rainfall particles zhu et al 2020a zhu et al 2020b which is referred as the z r relationship in this study the radar qpe product has 360 azimuths a radial resolution of 500 m and a detection range of 400 km the temporal resolution of the radar qpe data is 6 min to generate the radar qpe under the cartesian coordinate the pre processing procedures are run as follows fig 3 1 identification of the non meteorological echoes such as ground clutter clear air echo super refraction echo and electromagnetic wave interference echo 2 compute hybrid elevation angle by considering the occlusion impact of terrain 3 divide the rainfall into different types by applying a convective stratiform segregation method based on the vertically integrated liquid vil water qi et al 2013b seo et al 2020 zhang and qi 2010 4 conduct the vertical profile of reflectivity vpr correction which is very important to reduce overestimation errors caused by bright band in radar qpe cao and qi 2014 qi et al 2013a qi et al 2013b qi et al 2013c zhang and qi 2010 5 retrieve the rainfall via different relations of z r corresponding to different rainfall types 6 transact the polar coordinate into rectangular coordinate and 7 accumulate 6 min rainfall rate into hourly radar qpe 3 2 the icreslide model the icreslide model is proved to have a good performance in flood and landslide prediction not only in basin scale he et al 2016 but also in a large region wang et al 2020a it can simulate the hydrological processes realistically and assess landslide hazards robustly at the same time therefore the icreslide model was chosen to simulate the flood and landslide hazards in our study the icreslide model contains two parts the crest model which simulate the hydrological processes and the slide model which quantifies the stability of slopes specifically the crest model is a physically based distributed hydrological model that was developed by the university of oklahoma and nasa national aeronautics and space administration servir project team wang et al 2011 xue et al 2013 it includes many components concerning hydrological processes such as the vegetation interception the infiltration the soil moisture and the overland and subsurface flow rainfall is intercepted by vegetation canopy before it falls into ground surface after that rainfall is partitioned into surface and subsurface runoff based on the infiltration curve in which the vic variable infiltration capacity model is adopted a routing scheme is proposed to simulate the confluence process where the interactions between routing and runoff generation are considered the evapotranspiration is deducted throughout all model calculations the rainfall and pet data with other state parameters are used to force the model simulating the hydrological processes a detailed description can be found in the literature shen et al 2016 wang et al 2011 xue et al 2013 xue et al 2016 the slide model employs a series of mathematical formulations to calculate the slope stability during the time course the slope stability is expressed as a factor of safety fs which is defined as the ratio of resisting forces over destabilizing forces lower fs value represents less slope stability if fs is equal to or less than one the slide model predicts slope failure the original slide model takes the entire volume of rainfall into account neglecting interception and evapotranspiration which leads to a problem that the rainfall infiltrating into the soil is overestimated dramatically however the problem can be fixed by coupling the slide model with a hydrological model in which the vegetation interception and evapotranspiration are included the detailed description of the slide model can be found in the previous publications montrasio and valentino 2008 the two models are mainly linked through the state variable soil moisture which is mainly influenced by rainfall infiltration computed by the crest model in addition the crest model simulation also determines the subsurface water table which can further affect the slope stability the slide model is used to assess whether a slope is stable as the main concern of this study as the key input of the slide model soil moisture is computed by the crest model the coupling strategy is that the soil moisture simulated by the crest model is treated as the input of the slide model which calculates the factor of safety and hence the stability of slope can be judged 3 3 dynamic correction method for radar and gsmap satellite qpe due to the different detection methods radar qpe and gsmap satellite qpe have different accuracies compared to the gauge rainfall e g the radar rainfall may have a smaller uncertainty than satellite in order to reduce this uncertainty a suitable correction method should be applied in this study we adopted the geographical differential analysis gda method proposed by cheema cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 to correct the radar and gsmap satellite qpes based on the gauge rainfall because the gda method takes the difference between gauge rainfall and gridded rainfall i e radar and gsmap qpes in our study into account at a specific location a gauge station and hence these point level biases are interpolated into a spatial map the interpolation method used in the original gda method is inverse distance weight idw however we used the ordinary kriging method to do the interpolation in this study because the ordinary kriging method can better consider the geophysical difference through a covariance function the ordinary kriging method is widely used in geographical science and atmospheric science in previous studies the time step of correction or calibration for radar and satellite rainfall data was usually one day or one month cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 ma et al 2018b considering the time step of model simulation and the limitation of radar rainfall data that only lasts 16 days we choose six time intervals which are 3 6 12 24 48 and 96 hrs to obtain different sets of bias corrected rainfall data and to analyze what time interval will lead to a better bias correction here we named it the dynamic gda dgda method the procedure of dgda method is summarized as follows 1 calculate the bias between radar satellite qpe and gauge rainfall at the specific locations i e locations of gauge stations at each chosen time interval i e 3 6 12 24 48 or 96 hrs we calculate the difference between gauge rainfall total and radar satellite qpe rainfall total during the specific time interval as the bias e g if the time interval is set to 3 h we calculate the bias at each gauge station for every 3 h 1 δ p ti p ti p rti s t i where δ p ti is the difference between gauge rainfall total and radar satellite qpe rainfall total during the t t h time interval at the ith station p ti and p rti s t i are the gauge and radar satellite rainfall totals during the t t h time interval at the ith station respectively 2 produce the spatial bias maps i e gridded biases from the point level biases at gauge stations for each time interval for the whole period via the ordinary kriging method 3 partition the gridded biases during each time interval into the gridded biases at each hour according to the ratios of hourly qpe rainfall to qpe rainfall total during each time interval 4 correct the hourly biases of the original radar satellite rainfall data considering that the original spatial resolutions of radar and gsmap qpe are 1 km and 10 km respectively we also conduct the rainfall bias correction procedure at the 10 km scale for gsmap qpe its native spatial resolution is 10 km making us able to calculate the spatial biases directly for radar rainfall we first aggregated it into the 10 10 km resolution and then computed the gridded biases the rest steps are the same as the above 3 4 evaluation metrics of model performance in order to analyze the impacts of different sources of rainfall on the stream flow simulation the parameters of the icreslide model are calibrated first using the gauge rainfall the same calibrated parameter values are used in the model simulation that are driven by the radar and gsmap qpes the gauge rainfall is as the benchmark in comparison of the radar and gsmap qpes while the model simulations driven by gauge rainfall are used as the benchmark to compare the simulations driven by radar and gsmap qpes for rainfall comparison the commonly used metrics including the standard deviation sd pearson correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the accuracy for the evaluation of the corresponding hydrological simulations three commonly used metrics including the relative bias r and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are used as the performance evaluation metrics the nse quantifies the agreement between the simulated discharges and the observed ones its value ranges from negative infinity to 1 which can be calculated by following equation 2 nse 1 t 1 t q 0 t q m t 2 t 1 t q 0 t q 0 2 where q 0 t and q m t are the observed and simulated discharge at time t respectively q 0 is the average value of observed discharge the slope stability is assessed by an fs value simulated through the icreslide model which is essentially a binary classification model for landslide assessment for landslide simulation the output of the coupled model is the fs value which is compared with a threshold usually set to 1 to judge whether a slope is unstable it is a binary classification which can be evaluated by a receiver operating characteristic roc curve fawcett 2006 to obtain the roc curve the model prediction results are classified into four categories which are the true positive tp true negative tn false positive fp and false negative fn tp and fn are the number of instances when a recorded landslide event is correctly predicted to occur and incorrectly predicted to not occur by the model respectively tn and fp are the number of instances when no recorded landslide event is correctly predicted to not occur and incorrectly predicted to occur by the model respectively based on the above four quantities we can evaluate the model performance through the true positive ratio tpr true negative ratio tnr accuracy and error rate metrics 3 t p r t p t p f n 4 t n r t n t n f p 6 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p t n f p f n 7 e r r o r r a t e 1 a c c u r a c y by varying the fs threshold we can compute a series of tpr and tnr pairs to form the roc curve the model performs well if the roc curve is close to the upper right corner the area under the roc curve auc reflects the overall accuracy of the model simulation a higher auc means a more accurate model simulation 4 results 4 1 uncertainty and its correction in the radar and gsmap qpes in order to analyze the radar and gsmap qpes the cumulated rainfall of gauge radar and gsmap rainfall were calculated for the period of sep 22 to oct 07 2017 at each 1 km grid cell containing a rain gauge fig 4 shows the scatter density plots of the cumulated radar and gsmap rainfall comparing to the cumulated gauge observations as shown in fig 4 both radar qpe and gsmap qpe have a low accuracy comparing to the gauge observations indicated by the low values of r and high values of rmse fig 4 in addition radar qpe tends to underestimate the rainfall with an average bias of 0 457 mm fig 4a while gsmap qpe overestimates the rainfall with an average bias of 0 498 mm fig 4b relatively the gsmap qpe has a slightly better accuracy than the radar qpe indicated by the r rmse and bias metrics these results clearly demonstrate that considerable uncertainty exists in both radar and gsmap qpes in this case therefore bias correction is necessary to improve their quality to reduce uncertainty in radar and gsmap rainfall data the dgda correction method based on the gauge rainfall data is conducted fig 5 shows the scatter density plots of the cumulated radar bias corrected rainfall fig 5a 5f and the cumulated gsmap bias corrected rainfall fig 5g 5 l compared to the cumulated gauge rainfall at the site scale comparing to the original radar and gsmap qpes data the bias corrected radar and gsmap qpes are significantly improved and agree much better with the gauge observations fig 5 all of the three metrics in the bias corrected qpes fig 5 are all largely improved relative to those in the original qpes fig 4 indicating that the bias correction method is totally effective in addition the effectiveness of the dgda bias correction method is clearly dependent on the correction time interval as shown in fig 5a 5f the bias metric of the bias corrected radar qpe is first reduced from 0 133 mm to 0 012 mm when the correction time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 24 hrs and then increased as the time interval is increased from 24 hrs to 96 hrs the rmse metric of the bias corrected radar qpe also shows a relationship with the time interval similar to the bias time interval relationship fig 5a 5f rmse of the bias corrected radar qpe is first reduced from 50 839 mm to 38 958 mm as the correction time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 24 hrs and then increased as the time interval is increased from 24 hrs to 96 hrs fig 5a 5f in contrast the r metric of the bias corrected radar qpe increases first and then decreases as the time interval increases with the highest value as time interval is set to 24 hrs fig 5d these results suggest that simply extending the correction time interval does not necessarily reduce the error spread in the bias corrected radar qpe when the correction time interval is set between 12 hrs and 24 hrs the overall performance of the bias correction for the radar qpe in this case reaches the optimal indicated by the three metrics for the bias correction of the gsmap qpe bias metric of the gsmap bias corrected qpe is reduced first and then increased as the correction time interval increases fig 5g l the rmse metric of the gsmap bias corrected qpe is slightly increased as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 12 hrs and then gradually reduced as the time interval is increased from 12 hrs to 48 hrs fig 5g 5 k the r metric is first increased as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 12 hrs and then decreased as the time interval is increased which is similar to the rmse time interval relationship fig 5g l both of the bias and rmse statistics reach the lowest value when the time interval is set to 48 hrs fig 5k the overall performance of the bias correction for the gsmap qpe in this case reaches an optimal performance when the correction time interval is set between 12 hrs and 48 hrs taylor diagram is usually used in the analysis of meteorology data and can compare the sd rmse and r metrics at the same time the taylor diagrams of the cumulated radar bias corrected rainfall and the cumulated gsmap satellite bias corrected rainfall using six time intervals comparing to the cumulated gauge rainfall at the site scale are shown in fig 6 a and fig 6b respectively in addition we also compared the hourly regional average bias corrected radar and gsmap rainfall data sets with the hourly station based regional average rainfall from 00 00utc sep 22 to 23 00utc oct 7 2017 fig 6c and 6d in fig 6 a is the gauge observation while b c d e f and g presents the bias corrected results using the correction time intervals of 3 6 12 24 48 and 96 hrs respectively on the site level comparison that quantifies the agreement of the bias corrected qpes with the observations on the spatial patterns the results of both in radar and gsmap produced by the different correction time intervals are generally close to each other relatively speaking the results based on the correction time intervals of 6 12 and 24 hrs i e c d and e in fig 6a for the radar qpe have gained a better quality than the results based on the other correction intervals similar but slightly different the radar results the results based on the correction time intervals of 6 12 24 and 48 hrs i e c d e and f in fig 6b for the gsmap qpe have gained a better quality than the other results since the dgda bias correction method is implemented at each gauge station the bias correction can gain good results on different correction time intervals in contrast differential bias correction performance appears on the regional level comparison which measures the agreement of the bias corrected qpes with the observations over the time the results of bias corrected radar qpes using the correction time intervals of 12 and 24 hrs d and e in fig 6c are clearly better than the other results however bias correction for gsmap qpe achieves are better performance when the correction time intervals are set to 24 48 and 96 hrs e f and g in fig 6d to investigate the performance of bias correction on the correction of hourly rainfall data we further compared the bias corrected hourly radar and gsmap qpes with the observations at the site level fig 7 the bias metric of the bias corrected hourly radar qpe is first reduced from 21 933 mm to 11 388 mm as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 12 hrs and is then continuously increased as the time interval is increased from 12 hrs to 96 hrs fig 7a 7f the rmse metric of the bias corrected hourly radar qpe is also first decreased as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 24 hrs and is then increased as the time interval is increased from 24 hrs to 96 hrs fig 7a 7f the r statistic is first increased from 0 479 to 0 722 as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 12 hrs fig 7a 7c and is then decreased as the time interval is increased from 12 hrs to 96 hrs fig 7d 7f it is obvious that the bias correction can achieve the best results for the hourly bias corrected radar qpe when the correction time interval is set between 12 hrs and 24 hrs regarding the gsmap correction performance the bias metric of the bias corrected hourly gsmap qpe is first increased as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 12 hrs and is then decreased from 12 hrs to 96 hrs fig 7g 7 l as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 48 hrs the rmse and r statistics are decreased and increased respectively both of the two metrics reach their best values when time interval is equal to 48 hrs fig 7k it is clear that bias correction for the gsmap qpe can achieve the best results when the time interval is set between 24 hrs and 48 hrs fig 7j 7 k overall the bias correction for radar and gsmap qpes using the 24 hrs correction time interval can achieve an optimal result in terms of better capturing the both spatial and temporal variability of the observations therefore the bias corrected rainfall of radar and gsmap using the 24 hrs time interval are selected to drive the icreslide model for further analysis and hence analyze the impacts of original and corrected rainfall on the model simulations 4 2 hydrological evaluation of the original and bias corrected radar and gsmap qpes to analyze the utility of original radar and gsmap qpes and the effectiveness of the qpe bias correction we compared the simulated discharge driven by the gauge rainfall radar qpe gsmap qpe bias corrected radar qpe and bias corrected gsmap qpe with the observed discharge at the outlets of the basins fig 8 shows the cumulated stream flow discharge over time for all simulations and the observation the results in the ba river basin fig 8a are similar to those in the lan river basin fig 8b first the original gsmap qpe driven discharges are apparently overestimated comparing to the observations in the two basins green solid lines in fig 8a and 8b due to the positive biases in the gsmap qpe fig 4b while the original radar qpe driven discharges are clearly underestimated in both of the basins blue solid lines in fig 8a and 8b because of the negative biases in the radar qpe fig 8a in contrast the simulated discharges driven by the bias corrected radar blue dashed lines in fig 8a and 8b and gsmap green dashed lines in fig 8a and 8b rainfall agree very well with the observed discharge black lines in fig 8a and 8b and the simulated discharge driven by the gauge observations red lines in fig 8a and 8b in the two basins indicating that bias correction substantially improves the performance of the model which is critical for flood simulation and prediction the simulated discharges driven by the gauge observations red lines in fig 8a and 8b agree well with the observed ones black lines in fig 8a and 8b in both of the basins indicated by the nse values of 0 778 and 0 743 respectively these results suggest that the icreslide model has a capability of capturing the hydrological processes the nse values of the icreslide model driven by the original radar and gsmap qpes are 0 347 and 0 368 in the ba river basin respectively fig 8a and 0 105 and 0 406 in the lan river basin respectively these results are not satisfactory and demand an improvement to achieve a better prediction once the dgda bias correction is applied the nse metrics of the results driven by the bias corrected radar qpes reach 0 718 and 0 676 in the two basins while the nse values of those driven by the bias corrected gsmap qpes are 0 727 and 0 802 in the two basins to further compare the performance of model simulations forced by different rainfall data the nse relative bias and r metrics are calculated and summarized in table 1 the results driven by the uncorrected rainfall data apparently have lower qualities with lower nse values 0 40 and higher absolute relative biases up to 65 275 and 42 784 for the radar and gsmap results respectively indicating that the original radar and gsmap indeed contain considerable uncertainty in this region this region has a complex and steep terrain which may largely impair the accuracy of the radar and satellite rainfall retrieval algorithms however once the bias correction is applied the model results driven by the bias corrected radar and gsmap rainfall achieved a much better performance with the nse values 0 676 the absolute values of the relative bias 17 126 and the r values 0 753 table 1 relatively the results driven by the bias corrected radar rainfall are generally better than those driven by bias corrected gsmap rainfall in the ba river basin indicated by the higher nse and the lower relative bias in contrast the model results driven by the bias corrected gsmap qpe are slightly better than those driven by the bias corrected radar qpe in the lan river basin table 1 4 3 evaluation of the utility of the original and bias corrected radar and gsmap qpes for landslide prediction the landslide inventory recorded that three landslide events occurred in each of the two basins during the period of sep 22 to oct 07 2017 to evaluate the simulation results driven by different sources of rainfall 30 grid cells without reported landslides were randomly selected fig 9 shows the fs values of the model simulations driven by gauge radar gsmap bias corrected radar and bias corrected gsmap rainfall the red dashed line in fig 9 represents the critical value of slope stability i e fs 1 a lower value than 1 i e below the red dashed line indicates an unstable slope i e a modeled landslide event while a higher value than 1 i e above the red dashed line denotes a stable slope i e model predicts no landslide occurring the vertical blue dash line in fig 9 separates the six grid cells with reported landslide events from these randomly selected grid cells without reported landslides the simulation driven by the gauge observations correctly predicts four of the six landslide events fig 9 with a true positive ratio tpr of 66 7 and a true negative ratio tnr of 83 3 table 2 indicating that the icreslide model has an overall predictive capability for the slope stability when it is forced by the observed rainfall it is not surprise that the simulations driven by the original radar and gsmap qpes have downgraded performances than the simulation driven by the observed rainfall fig 9 and table 2 the tpr values for the simulations driven by the original radar and gsmap qpes are 33 3 and 50 respectively while the tnr values are 83 3 and 76 7 respectively both of the simulations driven by the original radar and gsmap qpes have high error rates that are 25 27 8 table 2 the rainfall bias correction has substantially improved the landslide prediction increased the tprs of the radar and gsmap based results by 16 7 and 16 7 respectively table 2 and reduced the error rates of the radar and gsmap based results by 11 1 and 13 9 respectively table 2 these results suggest that accuracy in the rainfall forcings is critical for the accurate prediction of landslides and the bias correction improves the accuracy of radar and satellite rainfall leading to better performance of model simulation and improving the predictive capability of the icreslide model for landslides to further analyze the accuracy of landslide prediction the roc curves of the simulations driven by the five sets of rainfall data are also derived fig 10 it is clear that the roc curves of the simulations driven by the bias corrected rainfall data are closer to the upper right corner than those of the uncorrected rainfall the rainfall bias correction makes the auc value of the roc curve increase from 0 633 to 0 767 and from 0 619 to 0 803 for the radar case and gsmap case respectively more important the results driven by the bias corrected rainfall are close to these driven by the gauge observations the auc values for the bias corrected radar and bias corrected gsmap driven cases 0 767 and 0 803 respectively are even higher than that for the gauge driven case auc 0 738 4 4 the impacts of gauge density and spatial resolution of qpes on the effectiveness of bias correction considering that the application of the dgda method would be dependent on the gauge density and spatial resolution we further analyzed the impacts of gauge density and spatial resolution of qpes on the effectiveness of bias correction in this study the total number of gauge stations is 334 with a station density of 1 242 stations per 100 km2 to further analyze the impact of the station density on the rainfall correction performance we conducted the rainfall correction procedure by randomly excluding 25 50 75 and 90 of the total stations which resulted in a station density of 0 930 0 621 0 309 and 0 123 stations per 100 km2 respectively the threshold of gauge density recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo is one gauge per 575 km2 gadelha et al 2019 i e 0 174 stations per 100 km2 the station densities by randomly excluding 25 50 and 75 of the total stations in this study can result in a higher gauge density than the wmo recommended gauge density while the resultant station density by randomly excluding 90 of the total are lower than the wmo recommended gauge density these results suggest that our experiments on the impacts of different station densities cover a wide range of station density and are sufficient to analyze the relationship between bias correction and gauge density to reduce the uncertainty in the random station excluding procedure we conducted 10 repeated trials each time and calculated their average value to quantify the performance of the bias correction method the statistical metrics used to quantify the performance of bias correction include the relative bias i e the ratio of the absolute bias with some stations excluded to the absolute bias with all gauge stations included relative rmse i e the ratio of the rmse with some stations excluded to the rmse with all gauge stations included and r as the number of stations or the station density decreases the rmse and r metrics are downgraded gradually for both radar fig 11 a and gsmap fig 11b cases however the relative bias metric does not show a monotonic relationship with the station density fig 11a and 11b these results highlight the importance of station density or station representativeness on achieving good bias correction which agree with the findings by tang et al 2018 and gadelha et al 2019 that the performance of gauge observation based radar satellite bias correction is dependent on the gauge density although the station density is important for the bias correction observations from even a small number of stations will be helpful for improving the quality and gsmap qpes to detect the impacts of different spatial resolutions on the rainfall bias correction we further conducted the rainfall correction at the spatial resolution of 10 km 10 km which is the same spatial resolution of the original gsmap qpe to match with the 10 km 10 km spatial resolution we aggregated the 1 km radar qpe to 10 km it is clear that the r values for the results with a finer resolution are higher than those with a coarser resolution and the rmse values for the results with a finer resolution are lower than those with a coarser resolution fig 12 indicating that the spatial resolution matters for the bias correction however the biases for the results with a finer resolution are slightly higher than those with a coarser resolution fig 12 5 conclusions and discussion in this study we investigated the utility of the c band one polarization radar qpe and the gsmap satellite qpe of the gpm mission for the integrated prediction of floods and landslides developed a dynamic bias correction to reduce uncertainty in radar and satellite qpes using gauge observations and explored the impacts of gauge density and spatial resolution of qpe on the effectiveness of bias correction in two hilly basins of southern shaanxi province of china this study highlights several valuable findings first both the c band one polarization radar qpe and gsmap satellite qpe provide valuable real time or quasi real time rainfall data for this region that can be used by the model to predict the flood and landslide hazards although these qpes have considerable uncertainty that need be reduced second the developed dynamic bias correction method is effective to reduce the uncertainty in the radar and satellite qpes and further largely improves the accuracy of near real time rainfall monitoring and hence predictive accuracy of the icreslide model for predicting both flood and landslide hazards finally although the station density and spatial resolution matters for the bias correction inclusion of the observations from even a small number of rain gauges will be helpful for reducing the uncertainty in the radar and satellite qpes the bias correction method developed in this study and the findings will be useful for the similar studies and provide valuable guidance for further developing the qpe algorithms and multi source precipitation merging methods in addition several findings in our study need be paid more attention our results find that the original radar qpe in this region is not very accurate and even has a slightly lower accuracy than the gsmap qpe several factors can contribute to the relatively low accuracy of the radar qpe first this region has a complex terrain and dense vegetation which may affect the rainfall detection of the radar in addition this radar is one polarization radar which limits its ability to gain better qpe however with the aid of sufficient gauge stations we can substantially reduce the uncertainty in the radar and gsmap qpes multi source precipitation merging method will be important way to improve the precipitation quality chao et al 2018 ma et al 2018a sivasubramaniam et al 2019 although gauge station density is a critical factor on the accuracy of multi source precipitation merging however it is difficult or infeasible in reality to build a large amount gauge stations everywhere especially in the mountainous areas due to the limitation of construction and finance an effective way to solve this problem is to develop new techniques and approaches to quantify the spatiotemporal uncertainty in the radar and gsmap qpes and or jointly utilize different observational or sensing platforms chen et al 2019 le et al 2020 tavakol davani et al 2013 the improvement of the radar and gsmap qpes will not only provide higher accuracy rainfall data but also improve the performance of integrated prediction of flood and landslide hazards as a critical forcing data of the hydrological models rainfall significantly affects the accuracy of the simulated discharge chao et al 2018 overestimation underestimation of rainfall usually leads to overestimated underestimated flood and landslide hazards in this study the ankang radar qpe and gsmap satellite qpe tends to underestimate and overestimate the rainfall storm in our study area during the sept 22 oct 7 2017 period respectively as a result they caused underestimated and overestimated hydrological processes respectively however with the aid of the dgda bias correction method the performance of discharge simulation is largely improved confirming the effectiveness of the rainfall correction method on the other hand the flood simulation result of radar bias corrected rainfall is slightly better than that of satellite bias corrected rainfall illustrating that radar rainfall with a higher native spatial resolution and can better represent the spatial patterns of rainfall in addition the bias corrected radar rainfall obtained higher nse and r values and a lower bias value on flood simulation than the bias corrected gsmap rainfall in ba river basin but the simulations driven by the bias corrected gsmap rainfall gains a slightly better result than those driven by the bias corrected radar rainfall in the lan river basin relative to the ba river basins the lan river basin has a more complex terrain this illustrates that although the dgda method can improve the accuracy of radar and gsmap satellite rainfall data the representativeness of the gauge data matters for the effectiveness of bias correction another issue is that our study period is relatively short 16 days in autumn due to the limited availability of radar qpe the results concluded from this short period study may be biased and different from the rainfall correction results for a longer period because the short period rainfall events could be caused by a specific storm system e g typhoon the bias correction method should be further validated in the other seasons e g spring and winter on a longer time period and in the other places to assess the robustness of the dgda method we believe that the above mentioned continuing studies will certainly draw a more solid conclusion on the performance and reliability of this developed bias correction method credit authorship contribution statement

4026,it is important to develop the integrated flood and landslide modeling system driven by radar and satellite to predict these hazards to mitigate their damages in this study we investigated the utility of the c band one polarization radar quantitative precipitation estimation qpe and the global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap satellite qpe for the integrated prediction of floods and landslides in two hilly basins of southern shaanxi province of china we further developed a dynamic bias correction to reduce uncertainty in radar and satellite qpes using gauge observations and explored the impacts of gauge density and spatial resolution of qpe on the effectiveness of bias correction our results show that the radar and gsmap qpes have respective large negative and positive biases the bias correction method has significantly improved the quality of both radar and gsmap qpes and the associated accuracies in the simulated hydrological processes and slope stability the bias correction method with a correction time interval of 24 h can achieve the optimal results for both radar and gsmap qpes although gauge density and spatial resolution impact the accuracy of the bias corrected methods for both radar and gsmap inclusion of the observations from even a small number of rain gauges will be helpful for reducing the uncertainty in the radar and satellite qpes 1 introduction rainfall induced flood and landslide hazards are destructive and harmful to both of human lives and infrastructure blöthe et al 2015 huang et al 2017 peruccacci et al 2012 globally economic losses caused by floods account for 30 40 of losses due to natural hazards during 1974 2003 guha sapir et al 2004 with the rapid growth of population and economy flood induced losses are becoming more and more severe chen et al 2021 he et al 2018 jonkman 2005 besides landslides are responsible for more than 1000 deaths and approximately 4 billion us dollars in property losses per year pradhan and youssef 2010 china is also severely affected by natural hazards including floods and landslides hong et al 2015 petley 2010 zhang et al 2019b the average property losses caused by flood are about 110 billion cny per year while the death is more than 5000 in recent years one study reports that landslide hazards have led to about 1100 fatalities and 5 10 billion us dollars since 2000 hong et al 2017 due to the massive fatalities and property losses caused by floods and landslides it is essential to develop the forecasting capacity of these hazards to reduce and further avoid the damages chen et al 2015 hydrological models for flood forecasting have developed from conceptual models burnash et al 1973 crawford and linsley 1966 sugawara et al 1984 to semi distributed models beven and kirkby 1979 duan and miller 1997 zhang et al 2021 and further to fully distributed models in the meantime landslide prediction has evolved from heuristic susceptibility approaches fookes 1997 griffiths 2002 griffiths and edwards 2001 guzzetti et al 2000 to empirical rainfall threshold models bogaard and greco 2018 caine 1980 glade et al 2000 guzzetti et al 2007 guzzetti et al 2008 and further to physically based slope stability models liao et al 2010 montrasio and valentino 2008 montrasio and valentino 2016a montrasio and valentino 2016b van asch et al 2007 wilkinson et al 2002 recently coupling the hydrological models with slope stability models he et al 2016 wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2016 have been developed to predict flood and landside simultaneously because the concept of cascading hazards has drawn more and more attention hydrological models can provide more accurate and realistic estimations of hydrological processes and states for slope stability model e g rainfall infiltration and soil moisture which is proved to improve the predictive capability for the landslide hazards and extend the functionality of the hydrological models rainfall as a key forcing data of hydrological models and landslide models has a significant impact on flood forecasting and simulations of hydrological processes and hence landslide prediction therefore it is important to obtain rainfall data as accurate as possible usually rainfall data can be observed estimated by ground gauge stations weather radars and meteorological satellites different rainfall data sources have their advantages and disadvantages for representing spatiotemporal characteristics of actual rainfall processes gauge rainfall is usually treated as the true value of actual rainfall because it measures the rainfall that falls into the ground surface however gauge rainfall is a point level observation and has to represent the rainfall spatial variability through a network making its representation depending on station density and spatial distribution of stations moreover distributed hydrological and land surface models require gridded rainfall as forcing which requires interpolation of gauge rainfall leading to some new errors and uncertainties hughes 2006 renard et al 2010 zhang et al 2021 radar rainfall can detect the spatial distribution of rainfall over a large region and often has a high temporal resolution e g 6 min it is derived by constructing a quantitative relation between rainfall e g rainfall intensity and reflectivity krajewski and smith 2002 wilson and brandes 1979 therefore the accuracy of radar rainfall is directly influenced by the precipitation retrieval algorithms which are usually built based on the distribution of raindrop size or rainfall rate atlas et al 1990 in addition the accuracy of radar rainfall is also affected by terrain and vegetation cover because they can occlude the electromagnetic waves emitted by radar qi and zhang 2013 smith and krajewski 1991 the accuracy of radar rainfall may be low if the terrain is complex and vegetation is dense relative to radar satellites can cover a much larger area hsu et al 1997 similar to radar rainfall the relation between actual rainfall and reflectivity received by satellite is built through different retrieval algorithms griffith et al 1978 so far the common global satellite rainfall datasets include the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm kummerow et al 1998 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap of the global precipitation measurement gpm mission ushio et al 2003 climate prediction center morphing cmorph data joyce et al 2004 the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2019 and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann hong et al 2005 among others which are based on different remote sensing sensors and retrieval algorithms however gauge corrected satellite rainfall is often substantially time lagged shen et al 2010 while near real time satellite rainfall has a low latency but a relatively high uncertainty as a result the above mentioned limitations often limit the utility of satellite rainfall for in particular real time flood forecasting of the small and medium sized basins wu and zhai 2012 gauge observations with automated quality control and reporting can overcome this shortcoming but it is usually unpractical to build dense gauge network for a large region in addition similar to near real time satellite rainfall gauge rainfall without automated quality control could be time lagged if quality control need be conducted to correct the potential systematic errors due to the biases in radar and satellite rainfall it is important to develop bias correction methods to improve the accuracy of radar and satellite rainfall data in recent years different bias correction methods have been developed for example cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 adopted the regression analysis and geographical differential analysis gda methods to calibrate the trmm rainfall based on gauge rainfall data and found that the rainfall calibrated by the gda method has a high accuracy chao et al 2018 proposed a bias correction method based on the mixed geographically weighted regression mgwr method for merging satellite and gauge rainfall in which the weights were determined by four different weighting functions the mgwr method improves the spatial resolution and quality of satellite rainfall and is valuable for hydrological modelling ma et al 2018b proposed a dynamic bayesian model averaging dbma scheme to blend multi satellite precipitation products providing a new solution for blending multi satellite rainfall data although the applicability and evaluation of radar and satellite precipitation products for flood simulation and prediction have been widely studied recently their applicability for landslide prediction and the prediction of rainfall triggered multiple hazards such as floods and landslides have not been well studied how to facilitate the integrated forecasting of flood and landslide hazards using the multi source rainfall estimates and how to improve the forecasting accuracy by reducing the uncertainty in the multi source rainfall estimates remain to be addressed therefore the objectives of this study are three fold 1 to investigate the utility of the c band quantitative precipitation estimation qpe from a radar of china new generation weather radar cinrad network and the gsmap satellite qpe of the gpm mission for integrated prediction of floods and landslides 2 to develop a dynamic bias correction to reduce uncertainty in radar and satellite qpes using gauge observations and 3 to explore the impacts of gauge density and spatial resolution of qpe on the effectiveness of bias correction to this end we first compared the radar and satellite qpes with the gauge observations and analyzed the uncertainties in these qpes we then developed a dynamic geographical differential analysis dgda method to correct the biases in the qpes finally we conducted the hydrological evaluation of the original and bias corrected qpes and quantified the impacts of different rainfall sources on the integrated flood landslide prediction simulation via the integrated coupled routing and excess storage and slope infiltration distributed equilibrium icreslide v2 0 model he et al 2016 wang et al 2020b 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study area our study area is located in the shaanxi province of northwest china fig 1 a which frequently suffers from flood and landslide hazards the statistical report shows that rainfall induced landslide hazards occur frequently across shaanxi with more than 1 000 landslide events during 2009 2012 because of steep slopes in its many areas and heavy rainfall in the monsoon seasons may to october zhang et al 2019a study area in this study is a nested region with a bigger rectangular area shown in fig 1a and fig 1b ranging from 108 e to 110 e in longitude and from 31 n to 33 n in latitude and two basins fig 1b within the rectangular area within the rectangular area we compared the gauge rainfall with the radar and satellite qpes and analyzed the uncertainty in these qpes within the basins we conducted the icreslide simulations driven by the gauge observations and qpes to conduct the hydrological evaluation of qpes and evaluate the effectiveness of the dynamic bias correction method the two basins are located in southern shaanxi and include the ba river basin and lan river basin fig 1a the ba river basin is a tributary of the han river the largest tributary of the yangzi river and has an area of 2 069 km2 its elevation ranges from 222 to 2 473 m fig 1b and has an average slope of 22 8 fig 2 a the average channel gradient of the ba river is about 28 6 annual rainfall in this basin is about 700 900 mm of which summer july to september rainfall contributes for 40 60 soil type is mainly loam in this basin fig 2b while forests cover most of its lands accompanied by a few cultivated lands in the plain area fig 2c the lan river basin is also a tributary of the han river with an area of 1845 km2 elevation decreases from southeast to northwest which is similar to that of the ba river basin fig 1b the average slope is 26 5 fig 2d which is steeper than that of the ba river basin the lan river often experiences flash floods and has the recorded highest peak flood of 2 220 m3 s the spatial distribution of soil type in the lan river basin is similar to that in the ba river basin mainly the loam some soils classified as clay and sandy loam are distributed in the upper stream fig 2e forest is also the dominant land cover type while some cultivated lands are located along the river and some grasslands are in the upper stream fig 2f both of the basins are located within the humid climatic zone and the qinling mountain making them having abundant rainfall and steep terrains therefore floods and landslides often occur across the two basins it is essential and important to develop the prediction capacity of these hazards to reduce and further avoid the damages using the radar and satellite technologies 2 2 data the data used in this study include hourly rainfall rates from the gauge stations a cinrad weather radar and gsmap satellite products potential evapotranspiration pet digital elevation model dem soil type land cover type hourly stream flow records and landslide inventory to make data comparable and consistent on the spatial resolution all gridded data were interpolated or resampled to an identical spatial resolution of 1 km 1 km 30 arcsec rainfall data used in this study have

polarization ankang radar with a radial resolution of 500 m and a detection range of 400 km which is located at 109 043 e and 32 693 n fig 1a the radar provided a continuous radar qpe product from 00 00utc sep 22 to 23 00utc oct 7 2017 the pre processing of radar qpe data is described in section 3 1 satellite rainfall data in this study were from the gsmap product gsmap gauge of the gpm mission which are adjusted by national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa climate prediction center cpc unified gauge based analysis of global daily precipitation the source precipitation data of gsmap are obtained by the passive microwave and infrared radiometers retrieval algorithm based on the moving vector with the kalman filter approach the temporal resolution of the gsmap gauge data is 1 h which is averaged from sub hourly observations of the specified hour the data has a spatial resolution of 0 1 0 1 grid approximately 10 km at the equator with a coverage of 60 n to 60 s to make it comparable to the radar data these data are interpolated into a spatial resolution of 1 km through the bi linear interpolation method considering the common data availability we set the time between

information on the landslide locations occurrence time and recorded economic losses in this study the rainfall and pet data are model forcing data while the dem soil type and land cover type are used to derive background information and model parameters such as flow direction flow accumulation slope angle soil water capacity saturate hydraulic conductivity soil cohesion porosity and friction angle stream flow discharge and landslide inventory data are for model evaluation 3 methodology 3 1 brief description of the radar qpe algorithm the ankang radar of the cinrad is a c band single polarization doppler weather radar we applied a well studied radar qpe algorithm to retrieve the rainfall rates based on the calibrated relationships between the radar echo intensity z and the precipitation rate r since both z and r are related to the diameter and number of precipitation particles based on this the conversion relationship between z and r can be established through the drop size distribution dsd of rainfall particles zhu et al 2020a zhu et al 2020b which is referred as the z r relationship in this study the radar qpe product has 360 azimuths a radial resolution of 500 m and a detection range of 400 km the temporal resolution of the radar qpe data is 6 min to generate the radar qpe under the cartesian coordinate the pre processing procedures are run as follows fig 3 1

rectangular coordinate and 7 accumulate 6 min rainfall rate into hourly radar qpe 3 2 the icreslide model the icreslide model is proved to have a good performance in flood and landslide prediction not only in basin scale he et al 2016 but also in a large region wang et al 2020a it can simulate the hydrological processes realistically and assess landslide hazards robustly at the same time therefore the icreslide model was chosen to simulate the flood and landslide hazards in our study the icreslide model contains two parts the crest model which simulate the hydrological processes and the slide model which quantifies the stability of slopes specifically the crest model is a physically based distributed hydrological model that was developed by the university of oklahoma and nasa national aeronautics and space administration servir project team wang et al 2011 xue et al 2013 it includes many components concerning hydrological processes such as the vegetation interception the infiltration the soil moisture and the overland and subsurface flow rainfall is intercepted by vegetation canopy before it falls into ground surface after that rainfall is partitioned into surface and subsurface runoff based on the infiltration curve in which the vic variable infiltration capacity model is adopted a routing scheme is proposed to simulate the confluence process where the interactions between routing and runoff generation are considered the evapotranspiration is deducted throughout all model calculations the rainfall and pet data with other state parameters are used to force the model simulating the hydrological processes a detailed description can be found in the literature shen et al 2016 wang et al 2011 xue et al 2013 xue et al 2016 the slide model employs a series of mathematical formulations to calculate the slope stability during the time course the slope stability is expressed as a factor of safety fs which is defined as the ratio of resisting forces over destabilizing forces lower fs value represents less slope stability if fs is equal to or less than one the slide model predicts slope failure the original slide model takes the entire volume of rainfall into account neglecting interception and evapotranspiration which leads to a problem that the rainfall infiltrating into the soil is overestimated dramatically however the problem can be fixed by coupling the slide model with a hydrological model in which the vegetation interception and evapotranspiration are included the detailed description of the slide model can be found in the previous publications montrasio and valentino 2008 the two models are mainly linked through the state variable soil moisture which is mainly influenced by rainfall infiltration computed by the crest model in addition the crest model simulation also determines the subsurface water table which can further affect the slope stability the slide model is used to assess whether a slope is stable as the main concern of this study as the key input of the slide model soil moisture is computed by the crest model the coupling strategy is that the soil moisture simulated by the crest model is treated as the input of the slide model which calculates the factor of safety and hence the stability of slope can be judged 3 3 dynamic correction method for radar and gsmap satellite qpe due to the different detection methods radar qpe and gsmap satellite qpe have different accuracies compared to the gauge rainfall e g the radar rainfall may have a smaller uncertainty than satellite in order to reduce this uncertainty a suitable correction method should be applied in this study we adopted the geographical differential analysis gda method proposed by cheema cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 to correct the radar and gsmap satellite qpes based on the gauge rainfall because the gda method takes the difference between gauge rainfall and gridded rainfall i e radar and gsmap qpes in our study into account at a specific location a gauge station and hence these point level biases are interpolated into a spatial map the interpolation method used in the original gda method is inverse distance weight idw however we used the ordinary kriging method to do the interpolation in this study because the ordinary kriging method can better consider the geophysical difference through a covariance function the ordinary kriging method is widely used in geographical science and atmospheric science in previous studies the time step of correction or calibration for radar and satellite rainfall data was usually one day or one month cheema and bastiaanssen 2012 ma et al 2018b considering the time step of model simulation and the limitation of radar rainfall data that only lasts 16 days we choose six time intervals which are 3 6 12 24 48 and 96 hrs to obtain different sets of bias corrected rainfall data and to analyze what time interval will lead to a better bias correction here we named it the dynamic gda dgda method the procedure of dgda method is summarized as follows 1 calculate the bias between radar satellite qpe and gauge rainfall at the specific locations i e locations of gauge stations at each chosen time interval i e 3 6 12 24 48 or 96 hrs we calculate the difference between gauge rainfall total and radar satellite qpe rainfall total during the specific time interval as the bias e g if the time interval is set to 3 h we calculate the bias at each gauge station for every 3 h 1 δ p ti p ti p rti s t i where δ p ti is the difference between gauge rainfall total and radar satellite qpe rainfall total during the t t h time interval at the ith station p ti and p rti s t i are the gauge and radar satellite rainfall totals during the t t h time interval at the ith station respectively 2 produce the spatial bias maps i e gridded biases from the point level biases at gauge stations for each time interval for the whole period via the ordinary kriging method 3 partition the gridded biases during each time interval into the gridded biases at each hour according to the ratios of hourly qpe rainfall to qpe rainfall total during each time interval 4 correct the hourly biases of the original radar satellite rainfall data considering that the original spatial resolutions of radar and gsmap qpe are 1 km and 10 km respectively we also conduct the rainfall bias correction procedure at the 10 km scale for gsmap qpe its native spatial resolution is 10 km making us able to calculate the spatial biases directly for radar rainfall we first aggregated it into the 10 10 km resolution and then computed the gridded biases the rest steps are the same as the above 3 4 evaluation metrics of model performance in order to analyze the impacts of different sources of rainfall on the stream flow simulation the parameters of the icreslide model are calibrated first using the gauge rainfall the same calibrated parameter values are used in the model simulation that are driven by the radar and gsmap qpes the gauge rainfall is as the benchmark in comparison of the radar and gsmap qpes while the model simulations driven by gauge rainfall are used as the benchmark to compare the simulations driven by radar and gsmap qpes for rainfall comparison the commonly used metrics including the standard deviation sd pearson correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse are used to evaluate the accuracy for the evaluation of the corresponding hydrological simulations three commonly used metrics including the relative bias r and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are used as the performance evaluation metrics the nse quantifies the agreement between the simulated discharges and the observed ones its value ranges from negative infinity to 1 which can be calculated by following equation 2 nse 1 t 1 t q 0 t q m t 2 t 1 t q 0 t q 0 2 where q 0 t and q m t are the observed and simulated discharge at time t respectively q 0 is the average value of observed discharge the slope stability is assessed by an fs value simulated through the icreslide model which is essentially a binary classification model for landslide assessment for landslide simulation the output of the coupled model is the fs value which is compared with a threshold usually set to 1 to judge whether a slope is unstable it is a binary classification which can be evaluated by a receiver operating characteristic roc curve fawcett 2006 to obtain the roc curve the model prediction results are classified into four categories which are the true positive tp true negative tn false positive fp and false negative fn tp and fn are the number of instances when a recorded landslide event is correctly predicted to occur and incorrectly predicted to not occur by the model respectively tn and fp are the number of instances when no recorded landslide event is correctly predicted to not occur and incorrectly predicted to occur by the model respectively based on the above four quantities we can evaluate the model performance through the true positive ratio tpr true negative ratio tnr accuracy and error rate metrics 3 t p r t p t p f n 4 t n r t n t n f p 6 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p t n f p f n 7 e r r o r r a t e 1 a c c u r a c y by varying the fs threshold we can compute a series of tpr and tnr pairs to form the roc curve the model performs well if the roc curve is close to the upper right corner the area under the roc curve auc reflects the overall accuracy of the model simulation a higher auc means a more accurate model simulation 4 results 4 1 uncertainty and its correction in the radar and gsmap qpes in order to analyze the radar and gsmap qpes the cumulated rainfall of gauge radar and gsmap rainfall were calculated for the period of sep 22 to oct 07 2017 at each 1 km grid cell containing a rain gauge fig 4 shows the scatter density plots of the cumulated radar and gsmap rainfall comparing to the cumulated gauge observations as shown in fig 4 both radar qpe and gsmap qpe have a low accuracy comparing to the gauge observations indicated by the low values of r and high values of rmse fig 4 in addition radar qpe tends to underestimate the rainfall with an average bias of 0 457 mm fig 4a while gsmap qpe overestimates the rainfall with an average bias of 0 498 mm fig 4b relatively the gsmap qpe has a slightly better accuracy than the radar qpe indicated by the r rmse and bias metrics these results clearly demonstrate that considerable uncertainty exists in both radar and gsmap qpes in this case therefore bias correction is necessary to improve their quality to reduce uncertainty in radar and gsmap rainfall data the dgda correction method based on the gauge rainfall data is conducted fig 5 shows the scatter density plots of the cumulated radar bias corrected rainfall fig 5a 5f and the cumulated gsmap bias corrected rainfall fig 5g 5 l compared to the cumulated gauge rainfall at the site scale comparing to the original radar and gsmap qpes data the bias corrected radar and gsmap qpes are significantly improved and agree much better with the gauge observations fig 5 all of the three metrics in the bias corrected qpes fig 5 are all largely improved relative to those in the original qpes fig 4 indicating that the bias correction method is totally effective in addition the effectiveness of the dgda bias correction method is clearly dependent on the correction time interval as shown in fig 5a 5f the bias metric of the bias corrected radar qpe is first reduced from 0 133 mm to 0 012 mm when the correction time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 24 hrs and then increased as the time interval is increased from 24 hrs to 96 hrs the rmse metric of the bias corrected radar qpe also shows a relationship with the time interval similar to the bias time interval relationship fig 5a 5f rmse of the bias corrected radar qpe is first reduced from 50 839 mm to 38 958 mm as the correction time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 24 hrs and then increased as the time interval is increased from 24 hrs to 96 hrs fig 5a 5f in contrast the r metric of the bias corrected radar qpe increases first and then decreases as the time interval increases with the highest value as time interval is set to 24 hrs fig 5d these results suggest that simply extending the correction time interval does not necessarily reduce the error spread in the bias corrected radar qpe when the correction time interval is set between 12 hrs and 24 hrs the overall performance of the bias correction for the radar qpe in this case reaches the optimal indicated by the three metrics for the bias correction of the gsmap qpe bias metric of the gsmap bias corrected qpe is reduced first and then increased as the correction time interval increases fig 5g l the rmse metric of the gsmap bias corrected qpe is slightly increased as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 12 hrs and then gradually reduced as the time interval is increased from 12 hrs to 48 hrs fig 5g 5 k the r metric is first increased as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 12 hrs and then decreased as the time interval is increased which is similar to the rmse time interval relationship fig 5g l both of the bias and rmse statistics reach the lowest value when the time interval is set to 48 hrs fig 5k the overall performance of the bias correction for the gsmap qpe in this case reaches an optimal performance when the correction time interval is set between 12 hrs and 48 hrs taylor diagram is usually used in the analysis of meteorology data and can compare the sd rmse and r metrics at the same time the taylor diagrams of the cumulated radar bias corrected rainfall and the cumulated gsmap satellite bias corrected rainfall using six time intervals comparing to the cumulated gauge rainfall at the site scale are shown in fig 6 a and fig 6b respectively in addition we also compared the hourly regional average bias corrected radar and gsmap rainfall data sets with the hourly station based regional average rainfall from 00 00utc sep 22 to 23 00utc oct 7 2017 fig 6c and 6d in fig 6 a is the gauge observation while b c d e f and g presents the bias corrected results using the correction time intervals of 3 6 12 24 48 and 96 hrs respectively on the site level comparison that quantifies the agreement of the bias corrected qpes with the observations on the spatial patterns the results of both in radar and gsmap produced by the different correction time intervals are generally close to each other relatively speaking the results based on the correction time intervals of 6 12 and 24 hrs i e c d and e in fig 6a for the radar qpe have gained a better quality than the results based on the other correction intervals similar but slightly different the radar results the results based on the correction time intervals of 6 12 24 and 48 hrs i e c d e and f in fig 6b for the gsmap qpe have gained a better quality than the other results since the dgda bias correction method is implemented at each gauge station the bias correction can gain good results on different correction time intervals in contrast differential bias correction performance appears on the regional level comparison which measures the agreement of the bias corrected qpes with the observations over the time the results of bias corrected radar qpes using the correction time intervals of 12 and 24 hrs d and e in fig 6c are clearly better than the other results however bias correction for gsmap qpe achieves are better performance when the correction time intervals are set to 24 48 and 96 hrs e f and g in fig 6d to investigate the performance of bias correction on the correction of hourly rainfall data we further compared the bias corrected hourly radar and gsmap qpes with the observations at the site level fig 7 the bias metric of the bias corrected hourly radar qpe is first reduced from 21 933 mm to 11 388 mm as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 12 hrs and is then continuously increased as the time interval is increased from 12 hrs to 96 hrs fig 7a 7f the rmse metric of the bias corrected hourly radar qpe is also first decreased as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 24 hrs and is then increased as the time interval is increased from 24 hrs to 96 hrs fig 7a 7f the r statistic is first increased from 0 479 to 0 722 as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 12 hrs fig 7a 7c and is then decreased as the time interval is increased from 12 hrs to 96 hrs fig 7d 7f it is obvious that the bias correction can achieve the best results for the hourly bias corrected radar qpe when the correction time interval is set between 12 hrs and 24 hrs regarding the gsmap correction performance the bias metric of the bias corrected hourly gsmap qpe is first increased as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 12 hrs and is then decreased from 12 hrs to 96 hrs fig 7g 7 l as the time interval is increased from 3 hrs to 48 hrs the rmse and r statistics are decreased and increased respectively both of the two metrics reach their best values when time interval is equal to 48 hrs fig 7k it is clear that bias correction for the gsmap qpe can achieve the best results when the time interval is set between 24 hrs and 48 hrs fig 7j 7 k overall the bias correction for radar and gsmap qpes using the 24 hrs correction time interval can achieve an optimal result in terms of better capturing the both spatial and temporal variability of the observations therefore the bias corrected rainfall of radar and gsmap using the 24 hrs time interval are selected to drive the icreslide model for further analysis and hence analyze the impacts of original and corrected rainfall on the model simulations 4 2 hydrological evaluation of the original and bias corrected radar and gsmap qpes to analyze the utility of original radar and gsmap qpes and the effectiveness of the qpe bias correction we compared the simulated discharge driven by the gauge rainfall radar qpe gsmap qpe bias corrected radar qpe and bias corrected gsmap qpe with the observed discharge at the outlets of the basins fig 8 shows the cumulated stream flow discharge over time for all simulations and the observation the results in the ba river basin fig 8a are similar to those in the lan river basin fig 8b first the original gsmap qpe driven discharges are apparently overestimated comparing to the observations in the two basins green solid lines in fig 8a and 8b due to the positive biases in the gsmap qpe fig 4b while the original radar qpe driven discharges are clearly underestimated in both of the basins blue solid lines in fig 8a and 8b because of the negative biases in the radar qpe fig 8a in contrast the simulated discharges driven by the bias corrected radar blue dashed lines in fig 8a and 8b and gsmap green dashed lines in fig 8a and 8b rainfall agree very well with the observed discharge black lines in fig 8a and 8b and the simulated discharge driven by the gauge observations red lines in fig 8a and 8b in the two basins indicating that bias correction substantially improves the performance of the model which is critical for flood simulation and prediction the simulated discharges driven by the gauge observations red lines in fig 8a and 8b agree well with the observed ones black lines in fig 8a and 8b in both of the basins indicated by the nse values of 0 778 and 0 743 respectively these results suggest that the icreslide model has a capability of capturing the hydrological processes the nse values of the icreslide model driven by the original radar and gsmap qpes are 0 347 and 0 368 in the ba river basin respectively fig 8a and 0 105 and 0 406 in the lan river basin respectively these results are not satisfactory and demand an improvement to achieve a better prediction once the dgda bias correction is applied the nse metrics of the results driven by the bias corrected radar qpes reach 0 718 and 0 676 in the two basins while the nse values of those driven by the bias corrected gsmap qpes are 0 727 and 0 802 in the two basins to further compare the performance of model simulations forced by different rainfall data the nse relative bias and r metrics are calculated and summarized in table 1 the results driven by the uncorrected rainfall data apparently have lower qualities with lower nse values 0 40 and higher absolute relative biases up to 65 275 and 42 784 for the radar and gsmap results respectively indicating that the original radar and gsmap indeed contain considerable uncertainty in this region this region has a complex and steep terrain which may largely impair the accuracy of the radar and satellite rainfall retrieval algorithms however once the bias correction is applied the model results driven by the bias corrected radar and gsmap rainfall achieved a much better performance with the nse values 0 676 the absolute values of the relative bias 17 126 and the r values 0 753 table 1 relatively the results driven by the bias corrected radar rainfall are generally better than those driven by bias corrected gsmap rainfall in the ba river basin indicated by the higher nse and the lower relative bias in contrast the model results driven by the bias corrected gsmap qpe are slightly better than those driven by the bias corrected radar qpe in the lan river basin table 1 4 3 evaluation of the utility of the original and bias corrected radar and gsmap qpes for landslide prediction the landslide inventory recorded that three landslide events occurred in each of the two basins during the period of sep 22 to oct 07 2017 to evaluate the simulation results driven by different sources of rainfall 30 grid cells without reported landslides were randomly selected fig 9 shows the fs values of the model simulations driven by gauge radar gsmap bias corrected radar and bias corrected gsmap rainfall the red dashed line in fig 9 represents the critical value of slope stability i e fs 1 a lower value than 1 i e below the red dashed line indicates an unstable slope i e a modeled landslide event while a higher value than 1 i e above the red dashed line denotes a stable slope i e model predicts no landslide occurring the vertical blue dash line in fig 9 separates the six grid cells with reported landslide events from these randomly selected grid cells without reported landslides the simulation driven by the gauge observations correctly predicts four of the six landslide events fig 9 with a true positive ratio tpr of 66 7 and a true negative ratio tnr of 83 3 table 2 indicating that the icreslide model has an overall predictive capability for the slope stability when it is forced by the observed rainfall it is not surprise that the simulations driven by the original radar and gsmap qpes have downgraded performances than the simulation driven by the observed rainfall fig 9 and table 2 the tpr values for the simulations driven by the original radar and gsmap qpes are 33 3 and 50 respectively while the tnr values are 83 3 and 76 7 respectively both of the simulations driven by the original radar and gsmap qpes have high error rates that are 25 27 8 table 2 the rainfall bias correction has substantially improved the landslide prediction increased the tprs of the radar and gsmap based results by 16 7 and 16 7 respectively table 2 and reduced the error rates of the radar and gsmap based results by 11 1 and 13 9 respectively table 2 these results suggest that accuracy in the rainfall forcings is critical for the accurate prediction of landslides and the bias correction improves the accuracy of radar and satellite rainfall leading to better performance of model simulation and improving the predictive capability of the icreslide model for landslides to further analyze the accuracy of landslide prediction the roc curves of the simulations driven by the five sets of rainfall data are also derived fig 10 it is clear that the roc curves of the simulations driven by the bias corrected rainfall data are closer to the upper right corner than those of the uncorrected rainfall the rainfall bias correction makes the auc value of the roc curve increase from 0 633 to 0 767 and from 0 619 to 0 803 for the radar case and gsmap case respectively more important the results driven by the bias corrected rainfall are close to these driven by the gauge observations the auc values for the bias corrected radar and bias corrected gsmap driven cases 0 767 and 0 803 respectively are even higher than that for the gauge driven case auc 0 738 4 4 the impacts of gauge density and spatial resolution of qpes on the effectiveness of bias correction considering that the application of the dgda method would be dependent on the gauge density and spatial resolution we further analyzed the impacts of gauge density and spatial resolution of qpes on the effectiveness of bias correction in this study the total number of gauge stations is 334 with a station density of 1 242 stations per 100 km2 to further analyze the impact of the station density on the rainfall correction performance we conducted the rainfall correction procedure by randomly excluding 25 50 75 and 90 of the total stations which resulted in a station density of 0 930 0 621 0 309 and 0 123 stations per 100 km2 respectively the threshold of gauge density recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo is one gauge per 575 km2 gadelha et al 2019 i e 0 174 stations per 100 km2 the station densities by randomly excluding 25 50 and 75 of the total stations in this study can result in a higher gauge density than the wmo recommended gauge density while the resultant station density by randomly excluding 90 of the total are lower than the wmo recommended gauge density these results suggest that our experiments on the impacts of different station densities cover a wide range of station density and are sufficient to analyze the relationship between bias correction and gauge density to reduce the uncertainty in the random station excluding procedure we conducted 10 repeated trials each time and calculated their average value to quantify the performance of the bias correction method the statistical metrics used to quantify the performance of bias correction include the relative bias i e the ratio of the absolute bias with some stations excluded to the absolute bias with all gauge stations included relative rmse i e the ratio of the rmse with some stations excluded to the rmse with all gauge stations included and r as the number of stations or the station density decreases the rmse and r metrics are downgraded gradually for both radar fig 11 a and gsmap fig 11b cases however the relative bias metric does not show a monotonic relationship with the station density fig 11a and 11b these results highlight the importance of station density or station representativeness on achieving good bias correction which agree with the findings by tang et al 2018 and gadelha et al 2019 that the performance of gauge observation based radar satellite bias correction is dependent on the gauge density although the station density is important for the bias correction observations from even a small number of stations will be helpful for improving the quality and gsmap qpes to detect the impacts of different spatial resolutions on the rainfall bias correction we further conducted the rainfall correction at the spatial resolution of 10 km 10 km which is the same spatial resolution of the original gsmap qpe to match with the 10 km 10 km spatial resolution we aggregated the 1 km radar qpe to 10 km it is clear that the r values for the results with a finer resolution are higher than those with a coarser resolution and the rmse values for the results with a finer resolution are lower than those with a coarser resolution fig 12 indicating that the spatial resolution matters for the bias correction however the biases for the results with a finer resolution are slightly higher than those with a coarser resolution fig 12 5 conclusions and discussion in this study we investigated the utility of the c band one polarization radar qpe and the gsmap satellite qpe of the gpm mission for the integrated prediction of floods and landslides developed a dynamic bias correction to reduce uncertainty in radar and satellite qpes using gauge observations and explored the impacts of gauge density and spatial resolution of qpe on the effectiveness of bias correction in two hilly basins of southern shaanxi province of china this study highlights several valuable findings first both the c band one polarization radar qpe and gsmap satellite qpe provide valuable real time or quasi real time rainfall data for this region that can be used by the model to predict the flood and landslide hazards although these qpes have considerable uncertainty that need be reduced second the developed dynamic bias correction method is effective to reduce the uncertainty in the radar and satellite qpes and further largely improves the accuracy of near real time rainfall monitoring and hence predictive accuracy of the icreslide model for predicting both flood and landslide hazards finally although the station density and spatial resolution matters for the bias correction inclusion of the observations from even a small number of rain gauges will be helpful for reducing the uncertainty in the radar and satellite qpes the bias correction method developed in this study and the findings will be useful for the similar studies and provide valuable guidance for further developing the qpe algorithms and multi source precipitation merging methods in addition several findings in our study need be paid more attention our results find that the original radar qpe in this region is not very accurate and even has a slightly lower accuracy than the gsmap qpe several factors can contribute to the relatively low accuracy of the radar qpe first this region has a complex terrain and dense vegetation which may affect the rainfall detection of the radar in addition this radar is one polarization radar which limits its ability to gain better qpe however with the aid of sufficient gauge stations we can substantially reduce the uncertainty in the radar and gsmap qpes multi source precipitation merging method will be important way to improve the precipitation quality chao et al 2018 ma et al 2018a sivasubramaniam et al 2019 although gauge station density is a critical factor on the accuracy of multi source precipitation merging however it is difficult or infeasible in reality to build a large amount gauge stations everywhere especially in the mountainous areas due to the limitation of construction and finance an effective way to solve this problem is to develop new techniques and approaches to quantify the spatiotemporal uncertainty in the radar and gsmap qpes and or jointly utilize different observational or sensing platforms chen et al 2019 le et al 2020 tavakol davani et al 2013 the improvement of the radar and gsmap qpes will not only provide higher accuracy rainfall data but also improve the performance of integrated prediction of flood and landslide hazards as a critical forcing data of the hydrological models rainfall significantly affects the accuracy of the simulated discharge chao et al 2018 overestimation underestimation of rainfall usually leads to overestimated underestimated flood and landslide hazards in this study the ankang radar qpe and gsmap satellite qpe tends to underestimate and overestimate the rainfall storm in our study area during the sept 22 oct 7 2017 period respectively as a result they caused underestimated and overestimated hydrological processes respectively however with the aid of the dgda bias correction method the performance of discharge simulation is largely improved confirming the effectiveness of the rainfall correction method on the other hand the flood simulation result of radar bias corrected rainfall is slightly better than that of satellite bias corrected rainfall illustrating that radar rainfall with a higher native spatial resolution and can better represent the spatial patterns of rainfall in addition the bias corrected radar rainfall obtained higher nse and r values and a lower bias value on flood simulation than the bias corrected gsmap rainfall in ba river basin but the simulations driven by the bias corrected gsmap rainfall gains a slightly better result than those driven by the bias corrected radar rainfall in the lan river basin relative to the ba river basins the lan river basin has a more complex terrain this illustrates that although the dgda method can improve the accuracy of radar and gsmap satellite rainfall data the representativeness of the gauge data matters for the effectiveness of bias correction another issue is that our study period is relatively short 16 days in autumn due to the limited availability of radar qpe the results concluded from this short period study may be biased and different from the rainfall correction results for a longer period because the short period rainfall events could be caused by a specific storm system e g typhoon the bias correction method should be further validated in the other seasons e g spring and winter on a longer time period and in the other places to assess the robustness of the dgda method we believe that the above mentioned continuing studies will certainly draw a more solid conclusion on the performance and reliability of this developed bias correction method credit authorship contribution statement

4027,understanding the annual variation in the transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio t et remains a challenge and is essential for a thorough understanding of plant responses to the changing environment we obtained the annual dynamics of t et in a semi arid area of the southwestern united states based on the medians of monthly t et derived from two et partitioning methods the variation in monthly t et was analysed and plant water use strategies were discussed based on the water use efficiency evaluated by the transpiration wue t the results show that physiological changes in plants are vital in the annual dynamics of t et switches in plant physiological status growth and dormancy at the start and end of growing seasons induce two dramatic changes in t et consequently there is an annual bimodal dynamic of monthly t et with a maximum of 0 84 in october and a minimum of 0 14 in december physiological biochemical variations of plants indicated by solar induced chlorophyll

studying the dynamics of t and t et is necessary for obtaining wue t variations and linking plant water use strategies to environmental variability perez priego 2018 the dynamics of t et during growing seasons have been widely recognised during growing seasons shrublands and grasslands in the southern united states display the lowest t et in the early growing season owing to the time lag between precipitation pulses at the beginning of the rainy season wetted root zone soil and upregulated plants scott et al 2015 globally high t et has been observed in the late growing season of agricultural or natural ecosystems wang et al 2014 t et and the leaf area index lai increased during the growing seasons of grass reflecting the surface controls of plants on t et wang et al 2013 recent results also indicate that t et may be less sensitive to the lai than previously assumed as a part of the covariation of t et and lai could be attributed to other seasonal patterns such as the soil water availability or phenology cycles nelson et al 2020 lai and growing stage collectively explained 43 of the variation in t et wang et al 2014 lai has been shown to explain only small 20 variations in the mean annual t et of agricultural or natural ecosystems li et al 2019 no significant relationship was found between t et and lai at diel daily or annual timescales for a temperate needle leaf forest berkelhammer et al 2016 fatichi and pappas 2017 also found that lai was not a key driver of the spatial variations of t et in growing seasons t et also changed with different precipitation patterns with regard to the timing frequency duration and intensity which is considered as a part of water use strategies in a temperate deciduous forest gu et al 2016 it has been reported that following a precipitation event of 9 7 mm t et increased from 63 4 to 88 5 in a growing maize field as the upper soil layer dried out while the plants accessed the deeper soil water hogan 2020 in particular water management can induce larger t et variations during the growing seasons in croplands compared to natural ecosystems xiao et al 2018 however considering the factors controlling the variations in t et no clear correlation for annual precipitation soil texture or ecosystem type was found in drylands worldwide and t et varied most during dynamic wetting drying episodes sun et al 2019 studies concerning t et in growing seasons have neglected the importance of seasonal t et variations to understand the factors controlling the t et variation and plant water use strategies recently the annual dynamics of t et have been reported in an annual cycle variations in water availability strongly influenced not only the t et scott 2021 but also the water use efficiency wue et the water use efficiency evaluated based on et wang et al 2021 the dynamics of t et may become complicated with varying levels of climatic and surface controls precipitation evaporative demand water availability leaf area stomatal conductance etc despite these efforts elucidating the annual t et dynamics and water use efficiency are still challenging and the water use strategies incorporated in the annual dynamics of t et and water use efficiency have not been studied well several et partitioning methods have been developed to achieve reliable t et estimates kool et al 2014 the stable isotope technique is a commonly used method but is costly and laborious wang et al 2013 good et al 2015 a typical uncertainty range for the stable isotope technique was 21 xiao et al 2018 the combined use of eddy covariance ec measurements and sap flow techniques provides a comprehensive method scott et al 2006 cammalleri et al 2013 however sap flow measurements are not representative of all species within the footprint of a flux tower scanlon and kustas 2010 proposed a correlation analysis method based on the similarity theory however it requires high frequency 10 hz turbulent data which are not widely available and tends to overestimate the soil flux components e klosterhalfen 2019 simple ec based approaches are promising for future use in various ecosystems through the global flux tower networks zhou et al 2014 proposed an underlying water use efficiency uwue gpp vpd0 5 et model based on uwue t et can be estimated as the ratio of the apparent uwue uwuea estimated using the linear regression between gpp vpd0 5 and et over the potential uwue uwuep estimated using the 95th quantile regression between gpp vpd0 5 and et zhou et al 2016 scott s method for t et estimation is applicable when linear regressions between monthly gpp abscissa and monthly et ordinate yield positive intercepts for months of the year subsequently monthly t et is estimated based on the intercepts considered as the multi year average e for the month along with the monthly et scott et al 2015 however the two ec based methods are constrained by certain assumptions the uwuep is assumed to be relatively constant under steady state conditions e g relatively constant atmospheric co2 and water stress for a given plant zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 the assumption for scott s method assumes that monthly gpp is a predictor of monthly et based on the multi year flux tower measurements scott et al 2015 given the uncertainty or bias associated with a single partitioning method using multiple methods to achieve reliable t et estimates is recommended hogan 2020 scott 2021 based on the eddy covariance measurements in a semi arid area we estimated the monthly t et ratios using ec based approaches proposed by zhou et al 2016 and scott et al 2015 for the growing and non growing seasons from 2008 to 2015 the major purpose of this study was to reveal the annual variation patterns of t et and t in semi arid regions the secondary objective was to reveal plant water use strategies for their survival in a changing environment 2 data and methods 2 1 sites and data the study area was santa rita southeast arizona usa santa rita is a semi arid land located between the chihuahua and sonoran deserts the land cover comprises mainly desert shrublands grasslands and savanna lands the köppen climate type is bsk a steppe with warm winters the long term mean annual temperature is 17 c the annual mean precipitation is approximately 320 mm with an annual potential et of 1400 mm the rainy season spans from july to september the growing season spans from march to october the non growing seasons span from december to february namely the winter months we obtained the ec and meteorological data from two ameriflux sites in santa rita us srg grassland with tree and shrub cover whose data are available from 2008 to 2015 and us srm woody savanna lands with grassland and shrub cover whose data are available from 2008 to 2015 vegetation fluorescence is the light emitted from chlorophyll during photosynthesis parazoo et al 2014 solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif measured by satellites is sensitive to both structural and biochemical variations in vegetation yang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 smith et al 2018 we used a 0 05 gosif product li and xiao 2019 to indicate variations in the vegetation of santa rita the land cover of santa rita and the sif pixels of the two sites were desert shrubs grasses and trees fig 1 the proportions of grasses shrubs and trees were different between the two sites despite this difference the land cover of the two sites is typical to santa rita a pooled dataset of the flux data from the two sites and the sif data of the two pixels approximately represents the dynamics of climate and vegetation in santa rita 2 2 methodology based on the half hourly observations at the two sites we calculated the gpp using the r package reddyproc wutzler et al 2018 and estimated the et from latent heat a standard and extensible ec data post processing was executed by the package including ustar filtering papale et al 2006 gap filling reichstein et al 2005 and flux partitioning lasslop et al 2010 we pooled the meteorological observations flux data and sif data of the two sites to gain medians of those variables for the months of a year to obtain representative annual dynamics of the variables in santa rita we calculated the monthly t et for the two sites using scott s and zhou s methods respectively we calculated the monthly t et using zhou s method in three stages of a year march june the pre monsoon phase with high energy and low water availability july september the monsoon phase with high energy and high water availability and october february the period with low energy and low water availability respectively we calculated the monthly t et ratios using scott s method when the linear correlation between the monthly gpp and et was sufficiently high pearson s r 0 7 the results of the two et partitioning methods were compared and the pearson s r of linear regressions between the results was calculated by months of a year subsequently the result of zhou s method was corrected the t et estimates of zhou s method as a predictor of the results of scott s method to reduce the uncertainty which is explained in section 3 2 although both scott s and zhou s methods have uncertainty the corrected t et estimates enhance the common variance of t et contained in the two results we grouped the months within a year stages as mentioned above during the correction to ensure that the pearson s r of linear regressions between the results is higher than 0 7 the t et from zhou s method in january february and december was directly employed as explained in section 3 2 based on the corrected monthly t et the monthly transpiration t et t et and leaf scale water use efficiency were calculated finally the corrected monthly t et calculated monthly t and wue t were obtained and their medians were calculated for months of the year to represent the responses of mixed vegetation in santa rita to the changing environment 3 results 3 1 annual patterns of climate and surface controls the annual patterns of net radiation rn precipitation p relative humidity rh gpp et and sif are shown in fig 2 rn consistently increases until may reaches a plateau from may to august and gradually decreases thereafter approximately 74 of the precipitation occurs during rainy seasons which is associated with the north american monsoon system perez ruiz et al 2010 plants gain sufficient energy and water during the rainy season in may and june precipitation is almost at its lowest level with an rh below 20 while rn is close to its peak value when the study area is in its driest state namely the pre monsoon drought fig 2 the study area is in its wettest state during july and august when the soil moisture content could recover accompanied by a humid atmosphere rh around 50 due to abundant rainfall in rainy seasons in winter there are obvious energy and water deficiencies however the rh was relatively high gpp et and sif are stimulated by sufficient precipitation and are constrained by insufficient rn consequently they are in the high level stage during the main growing seasons from july to october and in the low level stage during the pre monsoon growing seasons from march to june and non growing seasons displaying similar seasonal patterns gpp et and sif are relatively low from march to june because of the pre monsoon drought when the bare ground cover can increase from approximately 45 to 60 scott et al 2015 3 2 et partitioning results and annual dynamics of t et the monthly t et result from scott s method was unavailable for several months including january february june and december due to the insufficient linear correlation pearson s r 0 7 between monthly the gpp and et in the other months the monthly t et estimates from scott s method exhibited a clear linear correlation with those from zhou s method fig 3 indicating that these two methods have grasped the common variations of the monthly t et however the results of scott s method were greater than those of zhou s method fig 3 given that scott s method was verified by its comparison with direct measurements at santa rita scott et al 2015 zhou s method might underestimate t et this is possibly the case in dry land first uwuep is generally higher under water stress conditions than under non stress conditions second a higher quantile in the quantile regression of zhou s method produces a greater estimation of uwuep and consequently an underestimation of t et as shown in fig 4 the monthly mean t et increases by 22 on average when a 90 quantile is used to calculate the uwuep compared to that using the 95 quantile our results show less influence of different quantiles on the t et estimation in december january and february fig 4 indicating the robustness of the estimation during periods with low t et therefore we corrected the results of zhou s method according to those of scott s method to achieve t et estimates and enhance the common variations contained in the two results with no corrections for december january and february we combined the corrected monthly t et with the t et estimates from zhou s method in january february and december to represent the t et estimates in the months of a year fig 5 scott and biederman reported that the monthly t et of the two sites change from 0 45 to 0 54 in july 0 62 0 69 in august and 0 54 0 66 in september respectively scott et al 2015 these results fall within the scope of our results average 1 standard deviation although it is almost impossible to conduct an absolute validation for the partitioning results it is interesting to achieve an annual dynamic of monthly t et based on the medians of monthly t et estimates according to our estimates the monthly t et median reached its maximum 0 84 in october and dropped to its lowest level 0 14 in december the monthly t et ratios were low in non growing seasons with monthly t et medians not more than 0 21 furthermore there are two sharp changes in the annual dynamics of the monthly t et the first significant change occurs in march when t et sharply rises from 0 16 to 0 56 the second occurs in december with a quick drop of t et from 0 82 to 0 14 3 3 annual change of transpiration and leaf scale water use efficiency monthly t was calculated as the product of the monthly t et estimates and et the largest t was 91 mm month 1 during the observation period in santa rita while the lowest was only 0 7 mm month 1 t as an indicator of physiological biochemical variations in vegetation is constrained by the energy input and water availability our results showed that vegetation consumes more water average t of 37 19 mm month 1 during the main growing season when the energy and water inputs were abundant fig 6 in the pre monsoon growing seasons the energy input is moderate while precipitation is scarce thus t is obviously lower average t of 12 8 mm month 1 than that in the main growing season in the non growing season winter t is generally not more than 8 5 mm month 1 with an average of 3 2 mm month 1 the monthly wue t ranges from 0 to 6 54 gc kg 1 h2o fig 6 medians of wue t for months of a year change between 1 1 and 2 8 gc kg 1 h2o which is comparable to the range from 0 8 to 2 4 gc kg 1 h2o across dryland ecosystems in an arid region in northwest china wang et al 2021 the monthly wue t varies greatly in january february march june and december when the growth is obviously hindered by insufficient energy and or water stress which would significantly change ecosystem functions gu et al 2016 simultaneously the monthly wue t is less variable in the other months than in these five months according to the monthly wue t medians months of a year can be divided into two groups by the value 1 6 gc kg 1 h2o the low monthly wue t group includes march april october and november which denote the start and end of the growing seasons or the transition periods between non growing and growing seasons the high monthly wue t group included the other months of the growing and non growing seasons it is obvious that the wue t of plants is different between winter and summer in the semi arid area however it has been reported that wue et does not differ between winter and summer biederman et al 2018 notably wue t and wue et gpp et might result in opposite results the annual wue t dynamic does not follow the pattern of energy rn water availability p or physiological biochemical activities sif and is thus distinct from t the amount of water that can be used by plants i e t can be determined by rn p and sif but how this water is used namely wue t is influenced by the plant water use strategies the water use strategies of plants in a changing environment thus provide a deeper understanding of plant adaptability 4 discussion 4 1 variations of t et in an annual cycle reliable estimates of monthly t et produced reasonable estimates of the monthly t there is often a strong relationship between the et and gpp at water limited sites law et al 2002 in our case the linear correlation coefficient between the monthly gpp and et was 0 92 pearson s r stomatal conductance critically determines both the photosynthetic uptake of co2 and the loss of water transported from the leaf zhou et al 2014 thus a better linear correlation between monthly gpp and t was achieved r 0 96 suggesting the reliability of t and consequently the t et estimates the monthly t et estimates for the main growing seasons are reasonable during the main growing seasons the t et ratio was 0 58 for the chihuahuan desert shrubland scott et al 2006 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 found similar t et ratios of 0 54 0 18 and 0 57 0 19 for temperate grasslands respectively the t et of desert shrubs in northern china was 0 64 during the growing seasons with groundwater being the main water source for plant transpiration and soil evaporation zhao et al 2016 rain fed spring maize transpiration accounted for 59 and 56 of et in the semi arid loess plateau of china gao et al 2018 in the semi arid santa rita the monthly t et of the main growing season is 0 68 0 19 for the vegetation which is consistent with previous estimates ranging from 0 55 to 0 75 for southeast arizona hamerlynck et al 2014 furthermore the monthly t et median reached a peak in october 0 84 in our case similarly the t et ratio approached 0 91 at the end of the growing season in a cold semi arid site in china wherein grassland and woodland were the dominant land cover types li et al 2016a b in october precipitation was greatly reduced as the rainy season passed which could trigger a rapid drop in soil evaporation however moisture in the deep soil layer has a longer memory than precipitation stillman et al 2014 the antecedent deep soil moisture supports plant t to generate a high t et in the post monsoon period we also confirmed that the time lag induced the low t et in july at the beginning of the rainy season soil moisture gradually recovers which activates the ecosystem activities cable et al 2013 biederman et al 2018 however precipitation must first satisfy the soil moisture deficit before being absorbed by the roots scott and biederman 2017 it has been reported that vegetation t delays its responses to increased soil moisture for approximately three weeks after the onset of the monsoon cavanaugh et al 2011 the monthly t et medians change between 0 42 and 0 63 in the pre monsoon growing seasons and between 0 56 and 0 73 in the main growing seasons respectively in the pre monsoon growing seasons plants are suppressed by the pre monsoon drought as revealed by the low p sif t and gpp which induces lower t et values than those in the main growing seasons changes in the physiological status of plants related to dormancy contribute to two dramatic changes in the monthly t et before and after non growing seasons the lowest energy input in an annual cycle and limited precipitation forces plants into dormancy perez ruiz et al 2010 we confirmed that plants with inactive physiological biochemical activities become dormant in the winter months as indicated by the drops in sif gpp and t to their annual minimums the very low t et ratios in non growing seasons are appropriate for dormant plants additionally plant mortality coinciding with disadvantageous conditions hamerlynck et al 2013 could further limit the t et ratios after the non growing seasons the energy input rn sharply increased by 75 in march which is the largest annual change in monthly rn simultaneously the precipitation is approximately the sum of the previous two months the disadvantageous conditions disappeared and plants were subsequently upregulated out of dormancy which can be verified by the significant increases in sif t and gpp in march the re upregulated plants produced a large increase in t et from february to march before the non growing seasons plants were suppressed by persisting decreases in energy input and limited precipitation with a 63 and 64 decrease in t and gpp in november compared to october respectively however the sif only declined by 45 compared to t gpp which is controlled by stomata the relatively weak sif response indicates that plants struggle to maintain physiological biochemical activities before falling into dormancy a fairly high monthly t et median is produced by struggling plants however plants eventually downregulate and resume dormancy by suppressing the climate control rn p and rh consequently t et quickly dropped by 83 in december relative to november as shown in fig 7 there is a strong linear relationship between the monthly sif and t et from june to september t et 3 40 sif 0 36 r2 0 987 sif is directly related to the structural physiological and biochemical variations in vegetation yang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 smith et al 2018 therefore sif is a good plant metric for t et dynamics according to our results plants can have a dominant influence on the et partitioning during the growing seasons in a semi arid area however we could not find a single driving factor solely responsible for the intra annual dynamics of t et fig 7 the seasonal course of t et is related to both surface and climatic controls scott and biederman 2017 in our case the annual dynamics of t et are closely related to rn p sif t and gpp suggesting the climatic and physiological controls on et partitioning climatic controls tend to produce a t et pattern similar to those of sif t and gpp in the semi arid area while physiologic controls of plants probably break the pattern therefore in an annual cycle the t et ratio does not depend on any single factor for example the climate might be similar between february and november but the physiological status related to dormancy differs hence the monthly t et medians were obviously different between the two months we summarized the annual dynamics of monthly t et as follows when active plants are met with sufficient energy and water the monthly t et will be high and the mean anomaly will be low suggesting a stable high monthly t et for example in july august and september domain 1 in fig 8 the monthly t et mean is 0 64 and the mean anomaly is only 0 06 when suppressed plants are subjected to energy and water deficiencies the mean anomaly of monthly t et is high suggesting that it is highly variable for example the mean anomaly of monthly t et from october to february is 0 33 domain 3 fig 8 4 2 plant water use strategies wue et variability in arid ecosystems is primarily controlled by physical processes in semi arid and sub humid regions yang 2016 in our case wue t might be regulated not only by physical processes water stress and heat stress but also by biological processes transpiration dormancy germination senescence water and nutrient storage plants respond to regulations that reveal a wide range of water use strategies plants employ a moderate wue t during growing seasons to obtain as much gpp in semi arid areas notably plants seem to waste water by employing a moderate wue t in growing seasons fig 9 in particular precipitation can affect leaf level physiology through the direct dilution of soil nitrogen patrick et al 2009 dilution could be obvious in the semi arid area due to abundant monsoon precipitation consequently excess t is needed for plants to procure sufficient nutrients to obtain as much gpp as possible in the main growing seasons moreover wue t begins to decline when the leaf is exposed to temperatures exceeding the optimum hatfield and dold 2019 therefore overshoots in the stomatal opening are common features of plants under heat stress resulting in water loss to maintain the leaf temperature and maximize the gpp production lawson and vialet chabrand 2019 with sufficient energy and water gpp production and not water use efficiency has become the main concern for plants plants employ an almost constant monthly wue t during the growing season zhou et al 2014 demonstrated that the underlying water use efficiency describing a linear relationship between a gpp and t a is the rate of co2 assimilation at the leaf scale remains essentially constant for certain vegetation types during the growing season in our case the monthly wue t median remained almost unchanged with an average of 2 1 gc kg 1 h2o from may to september despite the large variations in the monthly sif fig 9 which is obviously different from the increase in the monthly t et median fig 7 more efforts are required to explain the almost constant monthly wue t during the growing seasons it has been reported that water use efficiency increases under water stress conditions tong et al 2019 reflecting the adaptability of plants in semi arid areas to water deficiency wang et al 2021 stomata are key players in the response of plants to water stress gambetta et al 2020 the reduction in photosynthesis is less than that in stomatal conductance which explains the increase in water use efficiency under water deficit stress conditions hatfield and dold 2019 in our case the monthly wue t median in june was slightly higher than that in other months as a result of the water stress at the end of the pre monsoon drought both gpp and sif decreased by 23 in june compared to may indicating a reduction in photosynthesis although we did not measure the stomatal conductance a very dry condition can be confirmed based on limited precipitation and considerably low rh in june which suggests reduced stomatal conductance grossiord 2020 plants survive the non growing seasons by greatly enhancing wue t plants here evergreen shrubs have to continue gpp production to survive the non growing seasons however t in non growing seasons is less than 3 mm month 1 on average and is less variable than that of the growing seasons to deal with this plants conduct highly efficient gpp production according to our result the monthly wue t median greatly increased from 1 10 gc kg 1 h2o november to 2 76 gc kg 1 h2o february with an increment of around 0 42 gc kg 1 h2o per month fig 9 finally plants increase the monthly wue t by up to 130 8 of the average wue t in growing seasons possibly due to the disappearance of heat stress the process can be described as wue t 114 93 sif 3 25 r2 0 970 suggesting a high sensitivity of wue t to sif in non growing seasons the rapid increase in wue t suggests a strong adaptability of plants to the changing environment in semi arid santa rita rapid stomatal responses have been reported to greatly improve the water use efficiency mcausland 2016 to a certain degree the strong adaptability could be supported by the rapidity of stomatal responses in the stomatal pore apertures size and density in changing environments bertolino et al 2019 plants employ a low wue t during the transition of the growth dormancy physiological cycle possibly to prepare for the subsequent stage according to our results wue t changed between 1 1 and 1 4 gc kg 1 h2o in the transition periods which was significantly lower than that in the growing and non growing seasons fig 9 the decrease in wue t in march and april is possibly related to the germination during plant physiological biochemical upregulation the decline of wue t in october and november might be a result of the grass senescence and water storage in shrubs and tree bodies during low production periods further studies are required to explain the decline in wue t during the transition of the growth dormancy physiological cycle 5 conclusions in an annual cycle the average monthly t et medians of vegetation composed of grasses shrubs and savanna is 0 52 0 24 in the semi arid santa rita arizona southwestern usa with a maximum of 0 84 in october and a minimum of 0 14 in december there is a bimodal annual dynamic of monthly t et medians the monthly t et medians change from 0 42 to 0 63 in the pre monsoon growing season march june and from 0 56 to 0 84 july october in the main growing season the monthly t et median is at a minimum in june during the growing seasons under the water stress of the pre monsoon drought in the non growing season from december to february the monthly t et medians are not more than 0 21 forming the other valley we found a strong linear relationship between sif and t et from june to september t et 3 40 sif 0 36 r2 0 987 sif is a good plant metric for t et dynamics climate controls especially the energy input stimulate plants physiological status which is crucial in the annual t et dynamics changes in the plant physiological status related to the dormancy contribute to the two dramatic changes in monthly t et when the energy input increases greatly in spring plants can quickly revert from dormancy producing a dramatic increase in t et when the energy input decreases greatly after growing seasons plants dramatically decrease the biomass production but produce the highest monthly t et a dramatic decrease in t et occurred when plants became dormant consequently plants can have a dominant influence on the et partitioning in semi arid areas in semi arid regions plants implement different water use strategies to adapt to changing environments the monthly wue t median remained almost unchanged 2 1 gc kg 1 h2o on average from may to september in growing seasons despite the large variations in monthly sif however the monthly wue t median greatly increased from 1 10 to 2 76 gc kg 1 h2o from november to february in non growing seasons displaying a high sensitivity to sif wue t 114 93 sif 3 25 r2 0 970 highly efficient production under conditions that inhibit transpiration less than 3 mm month 1 is the core strategy for plant survival in non growing seasons however with abundant energy and precipitation plants employ only a moderate wue t in the growing seasons on the one hand focusing on production and not the water use efficiency becomes the key strategy for plants with sufficient energy and water conversely the moderate wue t is considered to be a result of heat stress additionally low wue t values were employed at the start and end of the growing season which is considered as the transition during the growth dormancy physiological cycle of plants the reduction of wue t during the transition is believed to be a water use strategy for plants to prepare for upregulation downregulation out of or into dormancy further studies are required to address the global variation in t et dynamics wue t and related water use

4027,understanding the annual variation in the transpiration to evapotranspiration ratio t et remains a challenge and is essential for a thorough understanding of plant responses to the changing environment we obtained the annual dynamics of t et in a semi arid area of the southwestern united states based on the medians of monthly t et derived from two et partitioning methods the variation in monthly t et was analysed and plant water use strategies were discussed based on the water use efficiency evaluated by the transpiration wue t the results show that physiological changes in plants are vital in the annual dynamics of t et switches in plant physiological status growth and dormancy at the start and end of growing seasons induce two dramatic changes in t et consequently there is an annual bimodal dynamic of monthly t et with a maximum of 0 84 in october and a minimum of 0 14 in december physiological biochemical variations of plants indicated by solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif are linearly related to t et in growing seasons at a monthly scale t et 3 40 sif 0 36 r2 0 987 generally a stable high monthly t et occurs under sufficient energy and water conditions and a highly variable monthly t et occurs under energy and water deficient conditions in semi arid regions plants can flexibly adjust wue t following different water use strategies to survive or gain

growing seasons have been widely recognised during growing seasons shrublands and grasslands in the southern united states display the lowest t et in the early growing season owing to the time lag between precipitation pulses at the beginning of the rainy season wetted root zone soil and upregulated plants scott et al 2015 globally high t et has been observed in the late growing season of agricultural or natural ecosystems wang et al 2014 t et and the leaf area index lai increased during the growing seasons of grass reflecting the surface controls of plants on t et wang et al 2013 recent results also indicate that t et may be less sensitive to the lai than previously assumed as a part of the covariation of t et and lai could be attributed to other seasonal patterns such as the soil water availability or phenology cycles nelson et al 2020 lai and growing stage collectively explained 43 of the variation in t et wang et al 2014 lai has been shown to explain only small 20 variations in the mean annual t et of agricultural or natural ecosystems li et al 2019 no significant relationship was found between t et and lai at diel daily or annual timescales for a temperate needle leaf forest berkelhammer et al 2016 fatichi and pappas 2017 also found that lai was not a key driver of the spatial variations of t et in growing seasons t et also changed with different precipitation patterns with regard to the timing frequency duration and intensity which is considered as a part of water use strategies in a temperate deciduous forest gu et al 2016 it has been reported that following a precipitation event of 9 7 mm t et increased from 63 4 to 88 5 in a growing maize field as the upper soil layer dried out while the plants accessed the deeper soil water hogan 2020 in particular water management can induce larger t et variations during the growing seasons in croplands compared to natural ecosystems xiao et al 2018 however considering the factors controlling the variations in t et no clear correlation for annual precipitation soil texture or ecosystem type was found in drylands worldwide and t et varied most during dynamic wetting drying episodes sun et al 2019 studies concerning t et in growing seasons have neglected the importance of seasonal t et variations to understand the factors controlling the t et variation and plant water use strategies recently the annual dynamics of t et have been reported in an annual cycle variations in water availability strongly influenced not only the t et scott 2021 but also the water use efficiency wue et the water use efficiency evaluated based on et wang et al 2021 the dynamics of t et may become complicated with varying levels of climatic and surface controls precipitation evaporative demand water availability leaf area stomatal conductance etc despite these efforts elucidating the annual t et dynamics and water use efficiency are still challenging and the water use strategies incorporated in the annual dynamics of t et and water use efficiency have not been studied well several et partitioning methods have been developed to achieve reliable t et estimates kool et al 2014 the stable isotope technique is a commonly used method but is costly and laborious wang et al 2013 good et al 2015 a typical uncertainty range for the stable isotope technique was 21 xiao et al 2018 the combined use of eddy covariance ec measurements and sap flow techniques provides a comprehensive method scott et al 2006 cammalleri et al 2013 however sap flow measurements are not representative of all species within the footprint of a flux tower scanlon and kustas 2010 proposed a correlation analysis method based on the similarity theory however it requires high frequency 10 hz turbulent data which are not widely available and tends to overestimate the soil flux components e klosterhalfen 2019 simple ec based approaches are promising for future use in various ecosystems through the global flux tower networks zhou et al 2014 proposed an underlying water use efficiency uwue gpp vpd0 5 et model based on uwue t et can be estimated as the ratio of the apparent uwue uwuea estimated using the linear regression between gpp vpd0 5 and et over the potential uwue uwuep estimated using the 95th quantile regression between gpp vpd0 5 and et zhou et al 2016 scott s method for t et estimation is applicable when linear regressions between monthly gpp abscissa and monthly et ordinate yield positive intercepts for months of the year subsequently monthly t et is estimated based on the intercepts considered as the multi year average e for the month along with the monthly et scott et al 2015 however the two ec based methods are constrained by certain assumptions the uwuep is assumed to be relatively constant under steady state conditions e g relatively constant atmospheric co2 and water stress for a given plant zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 the assumption for scott s method assumes that monthly gpp is a predictor of monthly et based on the multi year flux tower measurements scott et al 2015 given the uncertainty or bias associated with a single partitioning method using multiple methods to achieve reliable t et estimates is recommended hogan 2020 scott 2021 based on the eddy covariance measurements in a semi arid area we estimated the monthly t et ratios using ec based approaches proposed by zhou et al 2016 and scott et al 2015 for the growing and non growing seasons from 2008 to 2015 the major purpose of this study was to reveal the annual variation patterns of t et and t in semi arid regions the secondary objective was to reveal plant water use strategies for their survival in a changing environment 2 data and methods 2 1 sites and data the study area was santa rita southeast arizona usa santa rita is a semi arid land located between the chihuahua and sonoran deserts the land cover comprises mainly desert shrublands grasslands and savanna lands the köppen climate type is bsk a steppe with warm winters the long term mean annual temperature is 17 c the annual mean precipitation is approximately 320 mm with an annual potential et of 1400 mm the rainy season spans from july to september the growing season spans from march to october the non growing seasons span from december to february namely the winter months we obtained the ec and meteorological data from two ameriflux sites in santa rita us srg grassland with tree and shrub cover whose data are available from 2008 to 2015 and us srm woody savanna lands with grassland and shrub cover whose data are available from 2008 to 2015 vegetation fluorescence is the light emitted from chlorophyll during photosynthesis parazoo et al 2014 solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif measured by satellites is sensitive to both structural and biochemical variations in vegetation yang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 smith et al 2018 we used a 0 05 gosif product li and xiao 2019 to indicate variations in the vegetation of santa rita the land cover of santa rita and the sif pixels of the two sites were desert shrubs grasses and trees fig 1 the proportions of grasses shrubs and trees were different between the two sites despite this difference the land cover of the two sites is typical to santa rita a pooled dataset of the flux data from the two sites and the sif data of the two pixels approximately represents the dynamics of climate and vegetation in santa rita 2 2 methodology based on the half hourly observations at the two sites we calculated the gpp using the r package reddyproc wutzler et al 2018 and estimated the et from latent heat a standard and extensible ec data post processing was executed by the package including ustar filtering papale et al 2006 gap filling reichstein et al 2005 and flux partitioning lasslop et al 2010 we pooled the meteorological observations flux data and sif data of the two sites to gain medians of those variables for the months of a year to obtain representative annual dynamics of the variables in santa rita we calculated the monthly t et for the two sites using scott s and zhou s methods respectively we calculated the monthly t et using zhou s method in three stages of a year march june the pre monsoon phase with high energy and low water availability july september the monsoon phase with high energy and high water availability and october february the period with low energy and low water availability respectively we calculated the monthly t et ratios using scott s method when the linear correlation between the monthly gpp and et was sufficiently high pearson s r 0 7 the results of the two et partitioning methods were compared and the pearson s r of linear regressions between the results was calculated by months of a year subsequently the result of zhou s method was corrected the t et estimates of zhou s method as a predictor of the results of scott s method to reduce the uncertainty which is explained in section 3 2 although both scott s and zhou s methods have uncertainty the corrected t et estimates enhance the common variance of t et contained in the two results we grouped the months within a year stages as mentioned above during the correction to ensure that the pearson s r of linear regressions between the results is higher than 0 7 the t et from zhou s method in january february and december was directly employed as explained in section 3 2 based on the corrected monthly t et the monthly transpiration t et t et and leaf scale water use efficiency were calculated finally the corrected monthly t et calculated monthly t and wue t were obtained and their medians were calculated for months of the year to represent the responses of mixed vegetation in santa rita to the changing environment 3 results 3 1 annual patterns of climate and surface controls the annual patterns of net radiation rn precipitation p relative humidity rh gpp et and sif are shown in fig 2 rn consistently increases until may reaches a plateau from may to august and gradually decreases thereafter approximately 74 of the precipitation occurs during rainy seasons which is associated with the north american monsoon system perez ruiz et al 2010 plants gain sufficient energy and water during the rainy season in may and june precipitation is almost at its lowest level with an rh below 20 while rn is close to its peak value when the study area is in its driest state namely the pre monsoon drought fig 2 the study area is in its wettest state during july and august when the soil moisture content could recover accompanied by a humid atmosphere rh around 50 due to abundant rainfall in rainy seasons in winter there are obvious energy and water deficiencies however the rh was relatively high gpp et and sif are stimulated by sufficient precipitation and are constrained by insufficient rn consequently they are in the high level stage during the main growing seasons from july to october and in the low level stage during the pre monsoon growing seasons from march to june and non growing seasons displaying similar seasonal patterns gpp et and sif are relatively low from march to june because of the pre monsoon drought when the bare ground cover can increase from approximately 45 to 60 scott et al 2015 3 2 et partitioning results and annual dynamics of t et the monthly t et result from scott s method was unavailable for several months including january february june and december due to the insufficient linear correlation pearson s r 0 7 between monthly the gpp and et in the other months the monthly t et estimates from scott s method exhibited a clear linear correlation with those from zhou s method fig 3 indicating that these two methods have grasped the common variations of the monthly t et however the results of scott s method were greater than those of zhou s method fig 3 given that scott s method was verified by its comparison with direct measurements at santa rita scott et al 2015 zhou s method might underestimate t et this is possibly the case in dry land first uwuep is generally higher under water stress conditions than under non stress conditions second a higher quantile in the quantile regression of zhou s method produces a greater estimation of uwuep and consequently an underestimation of t et as shown in fig 4 the monthly mean t et increases by 22 on average when a 90 quantile is used to calculate the uwuep compared to that using the 95 quantile our results show less influence of different quantiles on the t et estimation in december january and february fig 4 indicating the robustness of the estimation during periods with low t et therefore we corrected the results of zhou s method according to those of scott s method to achieve t et estimates and enhance the common variations contained in the two results with no corrections for december january and february we combined the corrected monthly t et with the t et estimates from zhou s method in january february and december to represent the t et estimates in the months of a year fig 5 scott and biederman reported that the monthly t et of the two sites change from 0 45 to 0 54 in july 0 62 0 69 in august and 0 54 0 66 in september respectively scott et al 2015 these results fall within the scope of our results average 1 standard deviation although it is almost impossible to conduct an absolute validation for the partitioning results it is interesting to achieve an annual dynamic of monthly t et based on the medians of monthly t et estimates according to our estimates the monthly t et median reached its maximum 0 84 in october and dropped to its lowest level 0 14 in december the monthly t et ratios were low in non growing seasons with monthly t et medians not more than 0 21 furthermore there are two sharp changes in the annual dynamics of the monthly t et the first significant change occurs in march when t et sharply rises from 0 16 to 0 56 the second occurs in december with a quick drop of t et from 0 82 to 0 14 3 3 annual change of transpiration and leaf scale water use efficiency monthly t was calculated as the product of the monthly t et estimates and et the largest t was 91 mm month 1 during the observation period in santa rita while the lowest was only 0 7 mm month 1 t as an indicator of physiological biochemical variations in vegetation is constrained by the energy input and water availability our results showed that vegetation consumes more water average t of 37 19 mm month 1 during the main growing season when the energy and water inputs were abundant fig 6 in the pre monsoon growing seasons the energy input is moderate while precipitation is scarce thus t is obviously lower average t of 12 8 mm month 1 than that in the main growing season in the non growing season winter t is generally not more than 8 5 mm month 1 with an average of 3 2 mm month 1 the monthly wue t ranges from 0 to 6 54 gc kg 1 h2o fig 6 medians of wue t for months of a year change between 1 1 and 2 8 gc kg 1 h2o which is comparable to the range from 0 8 to 2 4 gc kg 1 h2o across dryland ecosystems in an arid region in northwest china wang et al 2021 the monthly wue t varies greatly in january february march june and december when the growth is obviously hindered by insufficient energy and or water stress which would significantly change ecosystem functions gu et al 2016 simultaneously the monthly wue t is less variable in the other months than in these five months according to the monthly wue t medians months of a year can be divided into two groups by the value 1 6 gc kg 1 h2o the low monthly wue t group includes march april october and november which denote the start and end of the growing seasons or the transition periods between non growing and growing seasons the high monthly wue t group included the other months of the growing and non growing seasons it is obvious that the wue t of plants is different between winter and summer in the semi arid area however it has been reported that wue et does not differ between winter and summer biederman et al 2018 notably wue t and wue et gpp et might result in opposite results the annual wue t dynamic does not follow the pattern of energy rn water availability p or physiological biochemical activities sif and is thus distinct from t the amount of water that can be used by plants i e t can be determined by rn p and sif but how this water is used namely wue t is influenced by the plant water use strategies the water use strategies of plants in a changing environment thus provide a deeper understanding of plant adaptability 4 discussion 4 1 variations of t et in an annual cycle reliable estimates of monthly t et produced reasonable estimates of the monthly t there is often a strong relationship between the et and gpp at water limited sites law et al 2002 in our case the linear correlation coefficient between the monthly gpp and et was 0 92 pearson s r stomatal conductance critically determines both the photosynthetic uptake of co2 and the loss of water transported from the leaf zhou et al 2014 thus a better linear correlation between monthly gpp and t was achieved r 0 96 suggesting the reliability of t and consequently the t et estimates the monthly t et estimates for the main growing seasons are reasonable during the main growing seasons the t et ratio was 0 58 for the chihuahuan desert shrubland scott et al 2006 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 found similar t et ratios of 0 54 0 18 and 0 57 0 19 for temperate grasslands respectively the t et of desert shrubs in northern china was 0 64 during the growing seasons with groundwater being the main water source for plant transpiration and soil evaporation zhao et al 2016 rain fed spring maize transpiration accounted for 59 and 56 of et in the semi arid loess plateau of china gao et al 2018 in the semi arid santa rita the monthly t et of the main growing season is 0 68 0 19 for the vegetation which is consistent with previous estimates ranging from 0 55 to 0 75 for southeast arizona hamerlynck et al 2014 furthermore the monthly t et median reached a peak in october 0 84 in our case similarly the t et ratio approached 0 91 at the end of the growing season in a cold semi arid site in china wherein grassland and woodland were the dominant land cover types li et al 2016a b in october precipitation was greatly reduced as the rainy season passed which could trigger a rapid drop in soil evaporation however moisture in the deep soil layer has a longer memory than precipitation stillman et al 2014 the antecedent deep soil moisture supports plant t to generate a high t et in the post monsoon period we also confirmed that the time lag induced the low t et in july at the beginning of the rainy season soil moisture gradually recovers which activates the ecosystem activities cable et al 2013 biederman et al 2018 however precipitation must first satisfy the soil moisture deficit before being absorbed by the roots scott and biederman 2017 it has been reported that vegetation t delays its responses to increased soil moisture for approximately three weeks after the onset of the monsoon cavanaugh et al 2011 the monthly t et medians change between 0 42 and 0 63 in the pre monsoon growing seasons and between 0 56 and 0 73 in the main growing seasons respectively in the pre monsoon growing seasons plants are suppressed by the pre monsoon drought as revealed by the low p sif t and gpp which induces lower t et values than those in the main growing seasons changes in the physiological status of plants related to dormancy contribute to two dramatic changes in the monthly t et before and after non growing seasons the lowest energy input in an annual cycle and limited precipitation forces plants into dormancy perez ruiz et al 2010 we confirmed that plants with inactive physiological biochemical activities become dormant in the winter months as indicated by the drops in sif gpp and t to their annual minimums the very low t et ratios in non growing seasons are appropriate for dormant plants additionally plant mortality coinciding with disadvantageous conditions hamerlynck et al 2013 could further limit the t et ratios after the non growing seasons the energy input rn sharply increased by 75 in march which is the largest annual change in monthly rn simultaneously the precipitation is approximately the sum of the previous two months the disadvantageous conditions disappeared and plants were subsequently upregulated out of dormancy which can be verified by the significant increases in sif t and gpp in march the re upregulated plants produced a large increase in t et from february to march before the non growing seasons plants were suppressed by persisting decreases in energy input and limited precipitation with a 63 and 64 decrease in t and gpp in november compared to october respectively however the sif only declined by 45 compared to t gpp which is controlled by stomata the relatively weak sif response indicates that plants struggle to maintain physiological biochemical activities before falling into dormancy a fairly high monthly t et median is produced by struggling plants however plants eventually downregulate and resume dormancy by suppressing the climate control rn p and rh consequently t et quickly dropped by 83 in december relative to november as shown in fig 7 there is a strong linear relationship between the monthly sif and t et from june to september t et 3 40 sif 0 36 r2 0 987 sif is directly related to the structural physiological and biochemical variations in vegetation yang et al 2015 sun et al 2017 smith et al 2018 therefore sif is a good plant metric for t et dynamics according to our results plants can have a dominant influence on the et partitioning during the growing seasons in a semi arid area however we could not find a single driving factor solely responsible for the intra annual dynamics of t et fig 7 the seasonal course of t et is related to both surface and climatic controls scott and biederman 2017 in our case the annual dynamics of t et are closely related to rn p sif t and gpp suggesting the climatic and physiological controls on et partitioning climatic controls tend to produce a t et pattern similar to those of sif t and gpp in the semi arid area while physiologic controls of plants probably break the pattern therefore in an annual cycle the t et ratio does not depend on any single factor for example the climate might be similar between february and november but the physiological status related to dormancy differs hence the monthly t et medians were obviously different between the two months we summarized the annual dynamics of monthly t et as follows when active plants are met with sufficient energy and water the monthly t et will be high and the mean anomaly will be low suggesting a stable high monthly t et for example in july august and september domain 1 in fig 8 the monthly t et mean is 0 64 and the mean anomaly is only 0 06 when suppressed plants are subjected to energy and water deficiencies the mean anomaly of monthly t et is high suggesting that it is highly variable for example the mean anomaly of monthly t et from october to february is 0 33 domain 3 fig 8 4 2 plant water use strategies wue et variability in arid ecosystems is primarily controlled by physical processes in semi arid and sub humid regions yang 2016 in our case wue t might be regulated not only by physical processes water stress and heat stress but also by biological processes transpiration dormancy germination senescence water and nutrient storage plants respond to regulations that reveal a wide range of water use strategies plants employ a moderate wue t during growing seasons to obtain as much gpp in semi arid areas notably plants seem to waste water by employing a moderate wue t in growing seasons fig 9 in particular precipitation can affect leaf level physiology through the direct dilution of soil nitrogen patrick et al 2009 dilution could be obvious in the semi arid area due to abundant monsoon precipitation consequently excess t is needed for plants to procure sufficient nutrients to obtain as much gpp as possible in the main growing seasons moreover wue t begins to decline when the leaf is exposed to temperatures exceeding the optimum hatfield and dold 2019 therefore overshoots in the stomatal opening are common features of plants under heat stress resulting in water loss to maintain the leaf temperature and maximize the gpp production lawson and vialet chabrand 2019 with sufficient energy and water gpp production and not water use efficiency has become the main concern for plants plants employ an almost constant monthly wue t during the growing season zhou et al 2014 demonstrated that the underlying water use efficiency describing a linear relationship between a gpp and t a is the rate of co2 assimilation at the leaf scale remains essentially constant for certain vegetation types during the growing season in our case the monthly wue t median remained almost unchanged with an average of 2 1 gc kg 1 h2o from may to september despite the large variations in the monthly sif fig 9 which is obviously different from the increase in the monthly t et median fig 7 more efforts are required to explain the almost constant monthly wue t during the growing seasons it has been reported that water use efficiency increases under water stress conditions tong et al 2019 reflecting the adaptability of plants in semi arid areas to water deficiency wang et al 2021 stomata are key players in the response of plants to water stress gambetta et al 2020 the reduction in photosynthesis is less than that in stomatal conductance which explains the increase in water use efficiency under water deficit stress conditions hatfield and dold 2019 in our case the monthly wue t median in june was slightly higher than that in other months as a result of the water stress at the end of the pre monsoon drought both gpp and sif decreased by 23 in june compared to may indicating a reduction in photosynthesis although we did not measure the stomatal conductance a very dry condition can be confirmed based on limited precipitation and considerably low rh in june which suggests reduced stomatal conductance grossiord 2020 plants survive the non growing seasons by greatly enhancing wue t plants here evergreen shrubs have to continue gpp production to survive the non growing seasons however t in non growing seasons is less than 3 mm month 1 on average and is less variable than that of the growing seasons to deal with this plants conduct highly efficient gpp production according to our result the monthly wue t median greatly increased from 1 10 gc kg 1 h2o november to 2 76 gc kg 1 h2o february with an increment of around 0 42 gc kg 1 h2o per month fig 9 finally plants increase the monthly wue t by up to 130 8 of the average wue t in growing seasons possibly due to the disappearance of heat stress the process can be described as wue t 114 93 sif 3 25 r2 0 970 suggesting a high sensitivity of wue t to sif in non growing seasons the rapid increase in wue t suggests a strong adaptability of plants to the changing environment in semi arid santa rita rapid stomatal responses have been reported to greatly improve the water use efficiency mcausland 2016 to a certain degree the strong adaptability could be supported by the rapidity of stomatal responses in the stomatal pore apertures size and density in changing environments bertolino et al 2019 plants employ a low wue t during the transition of the growth dormancy physiological cycle possibly to prepare for the subsequent stage according to our results wue t changed between 1 1 and 1 4 gc kg 1 h2o in the transition periods which was significantly lower than that in the growing and non growing seasons fig 9 the decrease in wue t in march and april is possibly related to the germination during plant physiological biochemical upregulation the decline of wue t in october and november might be a result of the grass senescence and water storage in shrubs and tree bodies during low production periods further studies are required to explain the decline in wue t during the transition of the growth dormancy physiological cycle 5 conclusions in an annual cycle the average monthly t et medians of vegetation composed of grasses shrubs and savanna is 0 52 0 24 in the semi arid santa rita arizona southwestern usa with a maximum of 0 84 in october and a minimum of 0 14 in december there is a bimodal annual dynamic of monthly t et medians the monthly t et medians change from 0 42 to 0 63 in the pre monsoon growing season march june and from 0 56 to 0 84 july october in the main growing season the monthly t et median is at a minimum in june during the growing seasons under the water stress of the pre monsoon drought in the non growing season from december to february the monthly t et medians are not more than 0 21 forming the other valley we found a strong linear relationship between sif and t et from june to september t et 3 40 sif 0 36 r2 0 987 sif is a good plant metric for t et dynamics climate controls especially the energy input stimulate plants physiological status which is crucial in the annual t et dynamics changes in the plant physiological status related to the dormancy contribute to the two dramatic changes in monthly t et when the energy input increases greatly in spring plants can quickly revert from dormancy producing a dramatic increase in t et when the energy input decreases greatly after growing seasons plants dramatically decrease the biomass production but produce the highest monthly t et a dramatic decrease in t et occurred when plants became dormant consequently plants can have a dominant influence on the et partitioning in semi arid areas in semi arid regions plants implement different water use strategies to adapt to changing environments the monthly wue t median remained almost unchanged 2 1 gc kg 1 h2o on average from may to september in growing seasons despite the large variations in monthly sif however the monthly wue t median greatly increased from 1 10 to 2 76 gc kg 1 h2o from november to february in non growing seasons displaying a high sensitivity to sif wue t 114 93 sif 3 25 r2 0 970 highly efficient production under conditions that inhibit transpiration less than 3 mm month 1 is the core strategy for plant survival in non growing seasons however with abundant energy and precipitation plants employ only a moderate wue t in the growing seasons on the one hand focusing on production and not the water use efficiency becomes the key strategy for plants with sufficient energy and water conversely the moderate wue t is considered to be a result of heat stress additionally low wue t values were employed at the start and end of the growing season which is considered as the transition during the growth dormancy physiological cycle of plants the reduction of wue t during the transition is believed to be a water use strategy for plants to prepare for upregulation downregulation out of or into dormancy further studies are required to address the global variation in t et dynamics wue t and related water use

4028,land surface model lsm simulations forced by observed meteorological data provide spatially continuous and temporally complete soil moisture estimates but the influences of models and meteorological forcings are yet to be validated over a large area due to the lack of in situ measurements in this study the conjunctive surface subsurface process version 2 csspv2 model was driven by three meteorological forcings namely cldasv2 0 era5 and gldasv2 1 to provide soil moisture simulations over china the validations over 2090 in situ stations during 2012 2017 showed that cldasv2 0 csspv2 soil moisture simulation performed better than era5 and gldasv2 1 reanalysis products with an increased correlation of 26 68 and reduced errors of 14 24 at the daily time scale the improvements mostly originate from the use of an advanced lsm because cldasv2 0 csspv2 only increased the correlation by 5 35 and decreased the errors by up to 9 when compared with era5 csspv2 and gldasv2 1 csspv2 in contrast era5 csspv2 and gldasv2 1 csspv2 soil moisture simulations increased the correlations from their alternative reanalysis lsms by 17 63 and decreased the errors by up to 18 the results are similar when using the smap satellite product as the validation data the influence of the lsm was more obvious over semiarid regions such as northern china the influence of meteorological forcing was more significant for soil moisture simulations at the surface layer while the lsms played a more critical role for the middle and deep layers especially during the cold season due to freeze thaw processes this study demonstrates the possibility to further improve soil moisture estimates at a large scale with advanced lsms even with the emergence of modern reanalyses keywords soil moisture land surface model era5 gldas cldas 1 introduction soil moisture plays a critical role in the earth system for its significant influence on the pedogenic geomorphic and hydrological processes cosby et al 1984 di domenico et al 2006 it affects the partition of the surface sensible and latent heat exchanges with the atmosphere thus regulating the water and energy balances of the climate system famiglietti et al 1998 qui et al 2001 koster et al 2004 western et al 2004 xia et al 2015 sadri et al 2020 the memory of soil moisture has a great influence on regional weather forecasting papadopoulos et al 2008 meanwhile soil moisture has been considered as one of the most essential climate variables and been widely used as a key variable in numerous hydrological and climate modeling applications dharssi et al 2011 brocca et al 2012 therefore reliable soil moisture products are needed for weather prediction climate monitoring and model validation seneviratne et al 2010 ford and quiring 2019 generally soil moisture estimation methods include ground measurements satellite remote sensing and land surface model lsm simulations although ground measurements can provide relatively accurate estimates of soil moisture the incontinuity both in time and space limits its application at regional or global scales vereecken et al 2008 soil moisture estimates retrieved from satellite based remote sensing covers a large area but it only provides estimates of the surface soil layer over sparsely vegetated areas reichle et al 2007 drusch et al 2009 in contrast lsms forced with meteorological datasets can fill this gap and often serve as an alternative method for optimal land surface state estimation under physical and dynamic constraints robock et al 2000 sheffield et al 2004 wood et al 2011 riley and shen 2014 yuan et al 2018 since the late 1980s lsms have evolved from simple bucket models manabe 1969 to integrated earth system models dai 2020 however it has also been realized that lsms are subject to uncertainties from meteorological forcing data model structure and model parameters serpetzoglou and anagnostou 2010 nearing et al 2016 nair and indu 2018 nearing et al 2018 which leads to diverse performance of the model products in different regions xia et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 meteorological forcing datasets including precipitation temperature specific humidity surface pressure radiation wind speed and others are utilized by lsms to simulate land surface states the quality of meteorological forcing data is one of the most important factors to determine the accuracy of land surface model simulations no matter how complex lsms are in describing surface processes or how accurate their initial conditions are they will not produce accurate results if meteorological forcings are inaccurate cosgrove et al 2003 a systematic evaluation of forcing inputs of both gldas 1 and gldas 2 was conducted over china to demonstrate the need for improving gldas forcing data wang et al 2016 the era5 meteorological data was compared with stochastic data from a weather generator to drive lsm the results indicated that even though a weather generator can produce coherent climate time series the use of this synthetic data as meteorological forcing in a physically based land surface model does not necessarily reproduce the complex surface processes alves et al 2021 meanwhile as there was a desire to better understand the land surface processes through the use of increasingly complex and advanced models different models vary from model structure and model parameters overgaard et al 2006 fatichi et al 2016 xia et al 2019 parametric deviations and the errors within the model may have a negative impact on the quality of its output cosgrove et al 2003 several works investigated the effects of different models on simulating soil moisture where the models were driven by the same meteorological forcing data xia et al 2014 for example soil moisture simulated by noah mosaic sac and vic in the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 was evaluated against in situ soil moisture observation datasets in the united states and it was found that simulation skill varies with different models soil layers and sub regions xia et al 2014 eighteen satellite based and model based soil moisture products including era5 land hbv era5 hbv imerg and hbv mswep were evaluated to show that soil moisture estimates from complex data intensive models are not necessarily more accurate than those from relatively simple calibrated models guswa et al 2002 cammalleri et al 2015 orth et al 2015 beck et al 2020 since the impact of input forcing data and model structure on the soil moisture estimation has been collectively acknowledged to be important several studies have actually examined uncertainty in forcing data in relation to the model output maggioni et al 2011 alemohammad et al 2015 for instance dumedah and walker 2017 determined the level of forcing data uncertainty that is acceptable in the context of the land surface model to obtain a reliable soil moisture estimation however studies often focused on a small region due to the lack of soil moisture in situ observations which limits the generalization of the conclusions wang and zeng 2012 by validating against soil moisture observations over 2090 in situ stations this study aims to answer the following questions 1 what are the effects of different meteorological forcing data i e the latest cldasv2 0 era5 gldasv2 1 on soil moisture simulation over china 2 what is the simulation performance of different models including the newly developed surface subsurface process version 2 csspv2 model yuan et al 2018 and those used in the state of the art global reanalysis when using the same meteorological forcing data 3 do the effects of meteorological forcing data and models differ at different soil depths the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the model data and experimental design the results and discussions are explained in section 3 and summary and conclusions are outlined in section 4 2

spatial coverage of 60 160 e and 0 65 n at 0 0625 0 0625 resolution from 2008 to 2017 the cldasv2 0 meteorological forcing dataset including 2 m temperature 2 m specific humidity 10 m wind speed surface pressure precipitation and shortwave radiation was generated by using the ground and satellite observation data from a variety of sources the cldas version 2 0 provides hourly meteorological forcings specifically precipitation was firstly interpolated from more than 30 000 rain gauge data and then merged with cmorph product shortwave radiation was retrieved from fy 2 c f series

for the atmosphere and an advanced ldas de rosnay et al 2014 from 1979 to 2019 the number of observations assimilated in era5 increased from about 0 75 million per day to approximately 24 million per day for the ldas information on soil moisture was obtained from scatterometers while temperature and humidity were obtained from the global synop network the 0 25 0 25 hourly near surface

rooted in the common land model dai et al 2003 2004 with major improvements for hydrological processes choi et al 2007 yuan and liang 2011 liang et al 2012 ji et al 2017 liang et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 a storage based runoff generation scheme and the hydrological influence of soil organic matter are added into csspv2 to improve its performance in simulating terrestrial hydrology over the alpine basins yuan et al 2018 the model has been applied over several mountainous regions and the results show good performance in simulating hydrological variables including soil moisture streamflow et and total water storage ji et al 2017 ji and yuan 2018 yuan et al 2018 ji et al 2020 csspv2 solves the richard s equation in a terrain following coordinate system which can be briefly written as follows 1 θ t x l d x l θ θ x l k x l θ s x l q where θ is soil moisture x l x y z is the terrain following coordinate system d x l θ k x l θ ψ θ k x l θ and s x l represent diffusivity hydraulic conductivity and local terrain surface slopes respectively choi et al 2007 the sink term q includes transpiration loss and subsurface runoff the above equation is solved among the depths of 0 567 cm which were exponentially discretized into eleven layers 0 1 75 cm 1 75 4 51 cm 4 51 9 06 cm 9 06 16 55 cm 16 55 28 91 cm 28 91 49 29 cm 49 29 82 89 cm 82 89 138 28 cm 138 28 229 61 cm 229 61 380 19 cm and 380 19 567 64 cm the 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem data from the u s geological survey usgs was used to calculate the grid mean topography and subgrid standard deviations of slopes soil textures including sand clay and organic matter fractions were derived from the 30 30 arc second resolution gridded soil characteristics dataset of china which is based on 8979 soil profiles and the soil map of china shangguan et al 2013 dynamic monthly leaf area index lai with a spatial resolution of 0 05⁰ came from the global land surface satellite glass products xiao et al 2016 and the 1 km resolution usgs land cover category dataset was used to determine the dominant category 2 3 2 land surface models of era5 and gldasv2 1 the land surface component of era5 is the hydrology tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel balsamo et al 2009 balsamo et al 2011 based on a tiled approach representing different sub grid surface types for vegetation bare soil snow and open water htessel has four soil layers with depths of 7 cm 21 cm 72 cm and 189 cm in addition to in situ observations era5 is the first ecmwf reanalysis to include remotely sensed observations of soil moisture it significantly improved the simulations of soil moisture and surface fluxes by using satellite data such as ami on ers 1 2 and metop a b ascat the land surface model of gldasv2 1 is the noah model version 3 6 which applies finite difference spatial discretization methods and a crank nicholson time integration scheme to numerically integrate the governing equations of soil vegetation snowpack processes chen et al 1996 ek et al 2003 gldasv2 1 noah divides soil into four layers of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm 2 4 validation data daily soil moisture observations from 2929 stations during 2012 2017 were provided by cma the cma s soil moisture monitoring network was transformed in july 2013 from manual measurements to automatic monitoring wang and he 2015 by the end of 2017 cma had established 2776 automatic soil moisture observation asmo stations across china with a measurement frequency of one hour the high resolution asmo network with high quality and density provides an unprecedented opportunity for the validation of model products chen and yuan 2020 jiang et al 2020 the observations have 10 layers which range from 0 to 100 cm with an interval of 10 cm the asmo sensors were developed based on the frequency domain reflection fdr method to improve reliability of the asmo data quality control procedures were applied first according to working range of the fdr sensor and the observation specification by cma the soil moisture values larger than 0 5 m3 m 3 were removed second sites with less than one year of data were removed after that 2090 sites were selected for validation the spatial distribution of filtered in situ soil moisture stations is shown in fig 1 with record lengths years shown by different colors in general the observation stations in central and southeastern china are more intensive and have longer data durations especially in haihe river 313 sites yellow river 315 sites huaihe river 314 sites and yangtze river 589 sites basins in contrast the western and northern subregions have only about a hundred or even dozens of sites the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 provides operational soil moisture products of high quality which can be an independent data source for validating surface soil moisture at regional scale the enhanced smap level 3 daily product at 9 km resolution entekhabi et al 2015 are compared with the simulations at the depth of 0 5 cm from april 2015 to december 2017 soil moisture data from era5 reanalysis csspv2 simulations and in situ observations were all interpolated to the depth settings of gldasv2 1 noah with surface layer middle layer and deep layer representing 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm respectively the nearest neighbour approach was used to compare the land surface simulations with the in situ data for regional scale validation the smap product and csspv2 simulations were regridded to 0 25 to compare with era5 and gldasv2 1 reanalysis 2 5 experimental design the present study relies on the csspv2 model to conduct land surface simulations over china first the csspv2 was driven by the cldasv2 0 meteorological forcing dataset to produce soil moisture simulations at 30 km resolution and the results were compared with era5 htessel and gldasv2 1 noah reanalysis data at 2090 soil moisture in situ sites over china then the effects of meteorological forcing data were assessed by comparing the simulations from cldasv2 0 csspv2 era5 csspv2 and gldasv2 1 csspv2 the differences between era5 htessel and era5 csspv2 and between gldasv2 1 noah and gldasv2 1 csspv2 were used to assess the influence of lsms table 1 in addition smap surface soil moisture observations were used for independent regional validation all soil moisture model products were compared to observations at daily time scale all csspv2 simulations were conducted for two cycles from 2008 to 2017 at half hourly time steps with the land surface conditions at the end of the first cycle used for the initial conditions for the simulations in the second cycle the first cycle was taken as spin up and results in the second cycle were used for the analysis in this study two metrics were computed for each soil moisture product the correlation coefficient cc and unbiased root mean square error unrmse 3 results 3 1 evaluation of cldasv2 0 csspv2 and reanalysis soil moisture fig 2 depicts the spatial distributions of the cc between in situ and simulated daily soil moisture at the surface 0 10 cm middle 10 40 cm and deep 40 100 cm layers from 2012 to 2017 over continental china csspv2 simulations with cldasv2 0 meteorological forcing captured the surface soil moisture dynamics very well with the highest national average cc of 0 58 compared with other products fig 2a as the depth increased average cc decreased to 0 52 and 0 32 the ccs for era5 soil moisture show a clear spatial pattern with high correlations over southeast and low correlations over northwest fig 2d 2f compared with era5 the cldasv2 0 csspv2 improved the ccs by 26 53 and 68 from the surface layer to the deep layer respectively as compared with cldasv2 0 csspv2 and era5 gldasv2 1 showed the lowest ccs with most ccs 0 7 fig 2g 2i on average cldasv2 0 csspv2 improved correlations against gldasv2 1 by 57 68 and 33 at the three soil layers era5 performed better than gldasv2 1 at the surface and middle layers while worse than gldasv2 1 at the deep layer fig 3 shows the results for the unrmse of daily soil moisture simulations the three datasets all showed a larger unrmse for surface layer and smaller unrmse for deep layer compared with csspv2 and gldasv2 1 era5 had the largest error on average csspv2 reduced the unrmse from era5 by 16 19 and 21 at surface middle and deep layers respectively and by 15 14 and 12 as compared with gldasv2 1 the national mean absolute biases for three soil moisture products were listed in table 2 for the surface layer the smallest mean absolute bias was found for cldasv2 0 csspv2 which was 65 lower than era5 htessel for the middle and deep layers the mean absolute biases for cldasv2 0 csspv2 were slightly larger than gldasv2 1 noah but lower than era5 htessel compared with gldasv2 1 noah cldasv2 0 csspv2 had better performance in terms of correlation and unbiased rmse but slightly worse performance in terms of absolute bias which suggests that systematic bias may exist in fact cldasv2 0 csspv2 simulated soil moisture had a dry bias for the middle and deep layers at most observational stations not shown averaged over china the cldasv2 0 csspv2 soil moisture product showed a better performance than the other reanalysis datasets however they may differ in different subregions figs 4 and 5 show the cc and unrmse in the three soil moisture products for ten regions from northeast to southwest compared with era5 and gldasv2 1 cldasv2 0 csspv2 was significantly better in the northern regions including songhua liaohe haihe yellow northwest and huaihe river basins with higher cc and lower unrmse for the yangtze southeast pearl and southwest river basins over southern china the cc and unrmse of cldasv2 0 csspv2 were better in the shallow layer but did not show superiority in the middle and deep layers compared with gldasv2 1 the ccs of era5 were higher in the songhua river basin and several southern basins huaihe yangtze southeast peal and southwest river especially for the surface and middle soil layers 3 2 impact of meteorological forcing data in order to investigate the effect of meteorological forcing data on simulated soil moisture csspv2 was used to conduct simulations driven by meteorological forcing data of era5 and gldasv2 1 fig 6 shows the probability distribution functions pdfs of the cc and unrmse for all soil moisture simulations at the three depths the vertical dotted line represents the average value of the corresponding color pdf curve these national averages are also shown in table 2 the overall performance of cldasv2 0 csspv2 was the best with higher cc and lower unrmse in the three layers both model and meteorological data contributed to these results it can be seen that the influence of meteorological forcing is more important in the surface layer while the influence of the model is more important in the middle and deep layer as compared with the smap observations the cc and unrmse of simulations were calculated fig 7 on the national average cldasv2 0 csspv2 has the highest cc and the smallest unbiased rmse the cldasv2 0 meteorological forcing data performs best among three data sets with 6 and 25 improvements in the cc and 10 and 7 reductions in the unbiased rmse compared to era5 and gldasv2 1 compared with the lsm of era5 the improvement of csspv2 on the cc and unbiased rmse is less than 3 compared with the noahv3 6 the csspv2 has significant improvement on two indicators with the cc increased by 13 and the unbiased rmse decreased by 11 therefore the csspv2 model and the cldasv2 0 meteorological data show the best performance as validated against both the in situ observations and satellite measurements fig 8 shows the spatial distributions of differences in the ccs between observed and simulated daily soil moisture at three depths at the cma stations it can be seen that the ccs of csspv2 simulated soil moisture driven by era5 and gldasv2 1 decreased in three layers compared with that driven by cldasv2 0 the ccs of cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased by 11 12 and 5 compared with era5 csspv2 these increases are 35 26 and 8 for cldasv2 0 csspv2 compared with gldasv2 1 csspv2 here we only show the results of the ccs because the unrmse are similar averaged over china the impact of meteorological forcing data is even less in the deep layer the differences in soil moisture simulations from csspv2 driven by different meteorological forcing datasets are also aggregated over ten subregions as shown in fig 9 compared with cldasv2 0 csspv2 era5 csspv2 s ccs are almost the same over songhua and liaohe river basin smaller over the other eight basins for surface and middle layers while larger over the southwest river basin for deep layer compared with cldasv2 0 csspv2 gldasv2 1 csspv2 has lower ccs over most river basins except the middle layer of northwest river basin and deep layer of southwest river basin compared with fig 4 the influence of cldasv2 0 meteorological forcing data is not significant over several northern basins e g songhua liaohe haihe yellow and northwest river basin in southern basins the higher cc of cldasv2 0 csspv2 for the surface and middle layers in fig 4 is generally consistent with that in fig 9 under the influence of meteorological forcing data it can be seen that meteorological forcing data plays a role in these humid areas 3 3 impact of land surface model different models vary in terms of physics and parameters by comparing era5 htessel with era5 csspv2 or comparing gldasv2 1 noah with gldasv2 1 csspv2 the influence of model on simulating soil moisture can be distinguished the first row of fig 10 represents the difference of the ccs between the era5 htessel and era5 csspv2 where the ccs of era5 csspv2 increased by 17 41 and 63 csspv2 model improved soil moisture simulation especially in deep layer similarly compared with gldasv2 1 noah the ccs of gldasv2 1 csspv2 increased by 22 42 and 25 regardless of era5 or gldasv2 1 forcings csspv2 improved simulations over northern china fig 11 shows that the ccs of era5 htessel are smaller than era5 csspv2 mainly over northern china e g songhua liaohe haihe yellow and northwest basins but larger over some southern basins similar results were obtained for the comparison between gldasv2 1 noah and gldasv2 1 csspv2 therefore the superiority of csspv2 model is an important reason for the good performance of cldasv2 0 csspv2 in northern china 3 4 comparisons across seasons to evaluate the performance during different seasons metrics were calculated for spring djf summer mam fall jja and winter son for the three soil layers the mean ccs and unrmse for each season are shown in fig 12 cldasv2 0 csspv2 performed best in the four seasons with the highest cc and the lowest unrmse compared with era5 csspv2 and gldasv2 1 csspv2 cldasv2 0 csspv2 does not show significant seasonal differences compared with models of era5 and gldasv2 1 the csspv2 simulation performed significantly better in the cold season this is probably attributed to the improved representation of frozen soil dynamics in csspv2 to further explore the temporal variations of the simulations and observation fig 13 shows the seasonal climatology the dynamic changes of soil moisture can be well captured by cldasv2 0 csspv2 simulations while reanalysis of era5 htessel and gldasv2 1 noah perform poor during the cold season in northern china fig 13a 13e the csspv2 simulations driven by three sets of meteorological data all perform well except for the gldasv2 1 csspv2 simulations in the huaihe yangtze and pearl river basins fig 13f 13 g 13i the seasonal differences are more obvious in middle and deep soil layers figs 14 15 4 conclusions and discussion csspv2 soil moisture simulation driven by cldasv2 0 was evaluated over china along with era5 and gldasv2 1 reanalysis against daily observations between 2012 and 2017 at 2090 in situ stations on the national average cldasv2 0 csspv2 had the best performance in simulating soil moisture compared with era5 cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased the cc by 26 53 68 and decreased the unrmse by 17 21 24 from the surface to the deep layer compared with gldasv2 1 cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased the cc by 57 68 33 and decreased the unrmse by 14 16 from a regional perspective cldasv2 0 csspv2 had obvious advantages in northern china with a good performance csspv2 was then used to investigate the effect of meteorological forcing data on simulating soil moisture the meteorological forcing data of cldasv2 0 era5 and gldasv2 1 were used to drive csspv2 to simulate soil moisture respectively compared with era5 csspv2 cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased the cc by 7 8 3 and decreased the unrmse by 5 4 7 from the surface to the deep layer compared with gldasv2 1 csspv2 cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased the cc by 7 29 and decreased the unrmse by up to 10 for the influence of lsms era5 csspv2 increased the cc from era5 htessel by 17 41 63 and decreased the unrmse by 12 17 18 compared with gldasv2 1 gldasv2 1 csspv2 increased the cc by 22 42 25 and decreased the unrmse by 6 11 12 from the national average results cldasv2 0 csspv2 showed advantages both in terms of meteorological forcing data and lsm but the major improvement originates from lsm the ccs of cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased in haihe yellow huaihe yangtze southeast and pearl river basins especially in the surface and middle layers compared with models of era5 and gldasv2 1 csspv2 had a better performance in northern china moreover the influence of meteorological forcing is more important in the surface layer while the influence of the model is more important in the middle and deep layers in addition there is no significant seasonal difference in the effect of meteorological forcing data on the simulation results while the csspv2 simulation performs significantly better in the cold season smap product again verified the better performance of cldasv2 0 csspv2 simulation it should be acknowledged that cldasv2 0 csspv2 simulated soil moisture has systematically dry bias for the middle and deep layers at most cma observational stations which may be related to the soil texture related parameters e g soil porosity or other processes more research is needed to understand and improve the bias especially for applications where the absolute soil moisture values are important as a regional land reanalysis over china the forcing datasets of cldasv2 0 are likely to be better calibrated over this region than the global era5 and gldasv2 1 reanalysis benefiting from the assimilation of a large amount of surface observations results from this study will help to choose the most appropriate meteorological forcing product for conducting soil moisture related studies over china however other soil moisture products need to be assessed at a variety of spatial and temporal scales chen and yuan 2020 this study focuses on model validation from the perspective of meteorological data and lsms better performance of the csspv2 model as compared with noah and htessel may be attributed to the consideration of the influence of subgrid topographic variation on the grid mean soil moisture yuan and liang 2010 as the subgrid variability can be comparable to that of mean flux over dry areas such as the northern china in addition our previous research shows the finer resolution land surface datasets e g soil texture data lai and land use category also help improve csspv2 s performance by providing more accurate thermal and hydrological properties ji et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 lastly finer resolution of the soil layer discretization and soil moisture calculation may also have positive contributions further efforts are needed to quantify relative importance of these factors to the csspv2 s improvement credit

4028,land surface model lsm simulations forced by observed meteorological data provide spatially continuous and temporally complete soil moisture estimates but the influences of models and meteorological forcings are yet to be validated over a large area due to the lack of in situ measurements in this study the conjunctive surface subsurface process version 2 csspv2 model was driven by three meteorological forcings namely cldasv2 0 era5 and gldasv2 1 to provide soil moisture simulations over china the validations over 2090 in situ stations during 2012 2017 showed that cldasv2 0 csspv2 soil moisture simulation performed better than era5 and gldasv2 1 reanalysis products with an increased correlation of 26 68 and reduced errors of 14 24 at the daily time scale the improvements mostly originate from the use of an advanced lsm because cldasv2 0 csspv2 only increased the correlation by 5 35 and decreased the errors by up to 9 when compared with era5 csspv2 and gldasv2 1 csspv2 in contrast era5 csspv2 and gldasv2 1 csspv2 soil moisture simulations increased the correlations from their alternative reanalysis lsms by 17 63 and decreased the errors by up to 18 the results are similar when using the smap satellite product as the validation data the influence of the lsm was more obvious over semiarid regions such as northern china the influence of meteorological forcing was more significant for soil moisture simulations at the surface layer while the lsms played a more critical role for the middle and deep layers especially during the cold season due to freeze thaw processes this study demonstrates the possibility to further improve soil moisture estimates at a large scale with advanced lsms even with the emergence of modern reanalyses keywords soil moisture land surface model era5 gldas cldas 1 introduction soil moisture plays a critical role in the earth system for its significant influence on the pedogenic geomorphic and hydrological processes cosby et al 1984 di domenico et al 2006 it affects the partition of the surface sensible and latent heat exchanges with the atmosphere thus regulating the water and energy balances of the climate system famiglietti et al 1998 qui et al 2001 koster et al 2004 western et al 2004 xia et al 2015 sadri et al 2020 the memory of soil moisture has a great influence on regional weather forecasting papadopoulos et al 2008 meanwhile soil moisture has been considered as one of the most essential climate variables and been widely used as a key variable in numerous hydrological and climate modeling applications dharssi et al 2011 brocca et al 2012 therefore reliable soil moisture products are needed for weather prediction climate monitoring and model validation seneviratne et al 2010 ford and quiring 2019 generally soil moisture estimation methods include ground measurements satellite remote sensing and land surface model lsm simulations although ground measurements can provide relatively accurate estimates of soil moisture the incontinuity both in time and space limits its application at regional or global scales vereecken et al 2008 soil moisture estimates retrieved from satellite based remote sensing covers a large area but it only provides estimates of the surface soil layer over sparsely vegetated areas reichle et al 2007 drusch et al 2009 in contrast lsms forced with meteorological datasets can fill this gap and often serve as an alternative method for optimal land surface state estimation under physical and dynamic constraints robock et al 2000 sheffield et al 2004 wood et al 2011 riley and shen 2014 yuan et al 2018 since the late 1980s lsms have evolved from simple bucket models manabe 1969 to integrated earth system models dai 2020 however it has also been realized that lsms are subject to uncertainties from meteorological forcing data model structure and model parameters serpetzoglou and anagnostou 2010 nearing et al 2016 nair and indu 2018 nearing et al 2018 which leads to diverse performance of the model products in different regions xia et al 2014 kumar et al 2017 meteorological forcing datasets including precipitation temperature specific humidity surface pressure radiation wind speed and others are utilized by lsms to simulate land surface states the quality of meteorological forcing data is one of the most important factors to determine the accuracy of land surface model simulations no matter how complex lsms are in describing surface processes or how accurate their initial conditions are they will not produce accurate results if meteorological forcings are inaccurate cosgrove et al 2003 a systematic evaluation of forcing inputs of both gldas 1 and gldas 2 was conducted over china to demonstrate the need for improving gldas forcing data wang et al 2016 the era5 meteorological data was compared with stochastic data from a weather generator to drive lsm the results indicated that even though a weather generator can produce coherent climate time series the use of this synthetic data as meteorological forcing in a physically based land surface model does not necessarily reproduce the complex surface processes alves et al 2021 meanwhile as there was a desire to better understand the land surface processes through the use of increasingly complex and advanced models different models vary from model structure and model parameters overgaard et al 2006 fatichi et al 2016 xia et al 2019 parametric deviations and the errors within the model may have a negative impact on the quality of its output cosgrove et al 2003 several works investigated the effects of different models on simulating soil moisture where the models were driven by the same meteorological forcing data xia et al 2014 for example soil moisture simulated by noah mosaic sac and vic in the north american land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 was evaluated against in situ soil moisture observation datasets in the united states and it was found that simulation skill varies with different models soil layers and sub regions xia et al 2014 eighteen satellite based and model based soil moisture products including era5 land hbv era5 hbv imerg and hbv mswep were evaluated to show that soil moisture estimates from complex data intensive models are not necessarily more accurate than those from relatively simple calibrated models guswa et al 2002 cammalleri et al 2015 orth et al 2015 beck et al 2020 since the impact of input forcing data and model structure on the soil moisture estimation has been collectively acknowledged to be important several studies have actually examined uncertainty in forcing data in relation to the model output maggioni et al 2011 alemohammad et al 2015 for instance dumedah and walker 2017 determined the level of forcing data uncertainty that is acceptable in the context of the land surface model to obtain a reliable soil moisture estimation however studies often focused on a small region due to the lack of soil moisture in situ observations which limits the generalization of the conclusions wang and zeng 2012 by validating against soil moisture observations over 2090 in situ stations this study aims to answer the following questions 1 what are the effects of different meteorological forcing data i e the latest cldasv2 0 era5 gldasv2 1 on soil moisture simulation over china 2 what is the simulation performance of different models including the newly developed surface subsurface process version 2 csspv2 model yuan et al 2018 and those used in the state of the art global reanalysis when using the same meteorological forcing data 3 do the effects of meteorological forcing data and models differ at different soil depths the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the model data and experimental design the results and discussions are explained in section 3 and summary and conclusions are outlined in section 4 2

total water storage ji et al 2017 ji and yuan 2018 yuan et al 2018 ji et al 2020 csspv2 solves the richard s equation in a terrain following coordinate system which can be briefly written as follows 1 θ t x l d x l θ θ x l k x l θ s x l q where θ is soil moisture x l x y z is the terrain following coordinate system d x l θ k x l θ ψ θ k x l θ and s x l represent diffusivity hydraulic conductivity and local terrain surface slopes respectively choi et al 2007 the sink term q includes transpiration loss and subsurface runoff the above equation is solved among the depths of 0 567 cm which were exponentially discretized into eleven layers 0 1 75 cm 1 75 4 51 cm 4 51 9 06 cm 9 06 16 55 cm 16 55 28 91 cm 28 91 49 29 cm 49 29 82 89 cm 82 89 138 28 cm 138 28 229 61 cm 229 61 380 19 cm and 380 19 567 64 cm the 90 m resolution digital elevation model dem data from the u s geological survey usgs was used to calculate the grid mean topography and subgrid standard deviations of slopes soil textures including sand clay and organic matter fractions were derived from the 30 30 arc second resolution gridded soil characteristics dataset of china which is based on 8979 soil profiles and the soil map of china shangguan et al 2013 dynamic monthly leaf area index lai with a spatial resolution of 0 05⁰ came from the global land surface satellite glass products xiao et al 2016 and the 1 km resolution usgs land cover category dataset was used to determine the dominant category 2 3 2 land surface models of era5 and gldasv2 1 the land surface component of era5 is the hydrology tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel balsamo et al 2009 balsamo et al 2011 based on a tiled approach representing different sub grid surface types for vegetation bare soil snow and open water htessel has four soil layers with depths of 7 cm 21 cm 72 cm and 189 cm in addition to in situ observations era5 is the first ecmwf reanalysis to include remotely sensed observations of soil moisture it significantly improved the simulations of soil moisture and surface fluxes by using satellite data such as ami on ers 1 2 and metop a b ascat the land surface model of gldasv2 1 is the noah model version 3 6 which applies finite difference spatial discretization methods and a crank nicholson time integration scheme to numerically integrate the governing equations of soil vegetation snowpack processes chen et al 1996 ek et al 2003 gldasv2 1 noah divides soil into four layers of 0 10 cm 10 40 cm 40 100 cm and 100 200 cm 2 4 validation data daily soil moisture observations from 2929 stations during 2012 2017 were provided by cma the cma s soil moisture monitoring network was transformed in july 2013 from manual measurements to automatic monitoring wang and he 2015 by the end of 2017 cma had established 2776 automatic soil moisture observation asmo stations across china with a measurement frequency of one hour the high resolution asmo network with high quality and density provides an unprecedented opportunity for the validation of model products chen and yuan 2020 jiang et al 2020 the observations have 10 layers which range from 0 to 100 cm with an interval of 10 cm the asmo sensors were developed based on the frequency domain reflection fdr method to improve reliability of the asmo data quality control procedures were applied first according to working range of the fdr sensor and the observation specification by cma the soil moisture values larger than 0 5 m3 m 3 were removed second sites with less than one year of data were removed after that 2090 sites were selected for validation the spatial distribution of filtered in situ soil moisture stations is shown in fig 1 with record lengths years shown by different colors in general the observation stations in central and southeastern china are more intensive and have longer data durations especially in haihe river 313 sites yellow river 315 sites huaihe river 314 sites and yangtze river 589 sites basins in contrast the western and northern subregions have only about a hundred or even dozens of sites the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa soil moisture active passive smap mission entekhabi et al 2010 provides operational soil moisture products of high quality which can be an independent data source for validating surface soil moisture at regional scale the enhanced smap level 3 daily product at 9 km resolution entekhabi et al 2015 are compared with the simulations at the depth of 0 5 cm from april 2015 to december 2017 soil moisture data from era5 reanalysis csspv2 simulations and in situ observations were all interpolated to the depth settings of gldasv2 1 noah with surface layer middle layer and deep layer representing 0 10 cm 10 40 cm and 40 100 cm respectively the nearest neighbour approach was used to compare the land surface simulations with the in situ data for regional scale validation the smap product and csspv2 simulations were regridded to 0 25 to compare with era5 and gldasv2 1 reanalysis 2 5 experimental design the present study relies on the csspv2 model to conduct land surface simulations over china first the csspv2 was driven by the cldasv2 0 meteorological forcing dataset to produce soil moisture simulations at 30 km resolution and the results were compared with era5 htessel and gldasv2 1 noah reanalysis data at 2090 soil moisture in situ sites over china then the effects of meteorological forcing data were assessed by comparing the simulations from cldasv2 0 csspv2 era5 csspv2 and gldasv2 1 csspv2 the differences between era5 htessel and era5 csspv2 and between gldasv2 1 noah and gldasv2 1 csspv2 were used to assess the influence of lsms table 1 in addition smap surface soil moisture observations were used for independent regional validation all soil moisture model products were compared to observations at daily time scale all csspv2 simulations were conducted for two cycles from 2008 to 2017 at half hourly time steps with the land surface conditions at the end of the first cycle used for the initial conditions for the simulations in the second cycle the first cycle was taken as spin up and results in the second cycle were used for the analysis in this study two metrics were computed for each soil moisture product the correlation coefficient cc and unbiased root mean square error unrmse 3 results 3 1 evaluation of cldasv2 0 csspv2 and reanalysis soil moisture fig 2 depicts the spatial distributions of the cc between in situ and simulated daily soil moisture at the surface 0 10 cm middle 10 40 cm and deep 40 100 cm layers from 2012 to 2017 over continental china csspv2 simulations with cldasv2 0 meteorological forcing captured the surface soil moisture dynamics very well with the highest national average cc of 0 58 compared with other products fig 2a as the depth increased average cc decreased to 0 52 and 0 32 the ccs for era5 soil moisture show a clear spatial pattern with high correlations over southeast and low correlations over northwest fig 2d 2f compared with era5 the cldasv2 0 csspv2 improved the ccs by 26 53 and 68 from the surface layer to the deep layer respectively as compared with cldasv2 0 csspv2 and era5 gldasv2 1 showed the lowest ccs with most ccs 0 7 fig 2g 2i on average cldasv2 0 csspv2 improved correlations against gldasv2 1 by 57 68 and 33 at the three soil layers era5 performed better than gldasv2 1 at the surface and middle layers while worse than gldasv2 1 at the deep layer fig 3 shows the results for the unrmse of daily soil moisture simulations the three datasets all showed a larger unrmse for surface layer and smaller unrmse for deep layer compared with csspv2 and gldasv2 1 era5 had the largest error on average csspv2 reduced the unrmse from era5 by 16 19 and 21 at surface middle and deep layers respectively and by 15 14 and 12 as compared with gldasv2 1 the national mean absolute biases for three soil moisture products were listed in table 2 for the surface layer the smallest mean absolute bias was found for cldasv2 0 csspv2 which was 65 lower than era5 htessel for the middle and deep layers the mean absolute biases for cldasv2 0 csspv2 were slightly larger than gldasv2 1 noah but lower than era5 htessel compared with gldasv2 1 noah cldasv2 0 csspv2 had better performance in terms of correlation and unbiased rmse but slightly worse performance in terms of absolute bias which suggests that systematic bias may exist in fact cldasv2 0 csspv2 simulated soil moisture had a dry bias for the middle and deep layers at most observational stations not shown averaged over china the cldasv2 0 csspv2 soil moisture product showed a better performance than the other reanalysis datasets however they may differ in different subregions figs 4 and 5 show the cc and unrmse in the three soil moisture products for ten regions from northeast to southwest compared with era5 and gldasv2 1 cldasv2 0 csspv2 was significantly better in the northern regions including songhua liaohe haihe yellow northwest and huaihe river basins with higher cc and lower unrmse for the yangtze southeast pearl and southwest river basins over southern china the cc and unrmse of cldasv2 0 csspv2 were better in the shallow layer but did not show superiority in the middle and deep layers compared with gldasv2 1 the ccs of era5 were higher in the songhua river basin and several southern basins huaihe yangtze southeast peal and southwest river especially for the surface and middle soil layers 3 2 impact of meteorological forcing data in order to investigate the effect of meteorological forcing data on simulated soil moisture csspv2 was used to conduct simulations driven by meteorological forcing data of era5 and gldasv2 1 fig 6 shows the probability distribution functions pdfs of the cc and unrmse for all soil moisture simulations at the three depths the vertical dotted line represents the average value of the corresponding color pdf curve these national averages are also shown in table 2 the overall performance of cldasv2 0 csspv2 was the best with higher cc and lower unrmse in the three layers both model and meteorological data contributed to these results it can be seen that the influence of meteorological forcing is more important in the surface layer while the influence of the model is more important in the middle and deep layer as compared with the smap observations the cc and unrmse of simulations were calculated fig 7 on the national average cldasv2 0 csspv2 has the highest cc and the smallest unbiased rmse the cldasv2 0 meteorological forcing data performs best among three data sets with 6 and 25 improvements in the cc and 10 and 7 reductions in the unbiased rmse compared to era5 and gldasv2 1 compared with the lsm of era5 the improvement of csspv2 on the cc and unbiased rmse is less than 3 compared with the noahv3 6 the csspv2 has significant improvement on two indicators with the cc increased by 13 and the unbiased rmse decreased by 11 therefore the csspv2 model and the cldasv2 0 meteorological data show the best performance as validated against both the in situ observations and satellite measurements fig 8 shows the spatial distributions of differences in the ccs between observed and simulated daily soil moisture at three depths at the cma stations it can be seen that the ccs of csspv2 simulated soil moisture driven by era5 and gldasv2 1 decreased in three layers compared with that driven by cldasv2 0 the ccs of cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased by 11 12 and 5 compared with era5 csspv2 these increases are 35 26 and 8 for cldasv2 0 csspv2 compared with gldasv2 1 csspv2 here we only show the results of the ccs because the unrmse are similar averaged over china the impact of meteorological forcing data is even less in the deep layer the differences in soil moisture simulations from csspv2 driven by different meteorological forcing datasets are also aggregated over ten subregions as shown in fig 9 compared with cldasv2 0 csspv2 era5 csspv2 s ccs are almost the same over songhua and liaohe river basin smaller over the other eight basins for surface and middle layers while larger over the southwest river basin for deep layer compared with cldasv2 0 csspv2 gldasv2 1 csspv2 has lower ccs over most river basins except the middle layer of northwest river basin and deep layer of southwest river basin compared with fig 4 the influence of cldasv2 0 meteorological forcing data is not significant over several northern basins e g songhua liaohe haihe yellow and northwest river basin in southern basins the higher cc of cldasv2 0 csspv2 for the surface and middle layers in fig 4 is generally consistent with that in fig 9 under the influence of meteorological forcing data it can be seen that meteorological forcing data plays a role in these humid areas 3 3 impact of land surface model different models vary in terms of physics and parameters by comparing era5 htessel with era5 csspv2 or comparing gldasv2 1 noah with gldasv2 1 csspv2 the influence of model on simulating soil moisture can be distinguished the first row of fig 10 represents the difference of the ccs between the era5 htessel and era5 csspv2 where the ccs of era5 csspv2 increased by 17 41 and 63 csspv2 model improved soil moisture simulation especially in deep layer similarly compared with gldasv2 1 noah the ccs of gldasv2 1 csspv2 increased by 22 42 and 25 regardless of era5 or gldasv2 1 forcings csspv2 improved simulations over northern china fig 11 shows that the ccs of era5 htessel are smaller than era5 csspv2 mainly over northern china e g songhua liaohe haihe yellow and northwest basins but larger over some southern basins similar results were obtained for the comparison between gldasv2 1 noah and gldasv2 1 csspv2 therefore the superiority of csspv2 model is an important reason for the good performance of cldasv2 0 csspv2 in northern china 3 4 comparisons across seasons to evaluate the performance during different seasons metrics were calculated for spring djf summer mam fall jja and winter son for the three soil layers the mean ccs and unrmse for each season are shown in fig 12 cldasv2 0 csspv2 performed best in the four seasons with the highest cc and the lowest unrmse compared with era5 csspv2 and gldasv2 1 csspv2 cldasv2 0 csspv2 does not show significant seasonal differences compared with models of era5 and gldasv2 1 the csspv2 simulation performed significantly better in the cold season this is probably attributed to the improved representation of frozen soil dynamics in csspv2 to further explore the temporal variations of the simulations and observation fig 13 shows the seasonal climatology the dynamic changes of soil moisture can be well captured by cldasv2 0 csspv2 simulations while reanalysis of era5 htessel and gldasv2 1 noah perform poor during the cold season in northern china fig 13a 13e the csspv2 simulations driven by three sets of meteorological data all perform well except for the gldasv2 1 csspv2 simulations in the huaihe yangtze and pearl river basins fig 13f 13 g 13i the seasonal differences are more obvious in middle and deep soil layers figs 14 15 4 conclusions and discussion csspv2 soil moisture simulation driven by cldasv2 0 was evaluated over china along with era5 and gldasv2 1 reanalysis against daily observations between 2012 and 2017 at 2090 in situ stations on the national average cldasv2 0 csspv2 had the best performance in simulating soil moisture compared with era5 cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased the cc by 26 53 68 and decreased the unrmse by 17 21 24 from the surface to the deep layer compared with gldasv2 1 cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased the cc by 57 68 33 and decreased the unrmse by 14 16 from a regional perspective cldasv2 0 csspv2 had obvious advantages in northern china with a good performance csspv2 was then used to investigate the effect of meteorological forcing data on simulating soil moisture the meteorological forcing data of cldasv2 0 era5 and gldasv2 1 were used to drive csspv2 to simulate soil moisture respectively compared with era5 csspv2 cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased the cc by 7 8 3 and decreased the unrmse by 5 4 7 from the surface to the deep layer compared with gldasv2 1 csspv2 cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased the cc by 7 29 and decreased the unrmse by up to 10 for the influence of lsms era5 csspv2 increased the cc from era5 htessel by 17 41 63 and decreased the unrmse by 12 17 18 compared with gldasv2 1 gldasv2 1 csspv2 increased the cc by 22 42 25 and decreased the unrmse by 6 11 12 from the national average results cldasv2 0 csspv2 showed advantages both in terms of meteorological forcing data and lsm but the major improvement originates from lsm the ccs of cldasv2 0 csspv2 increased in haihe yellow huaihe yangtze southeast and pearl river basins especially in the surface and middle layers compared with models of era5 and gldasv2 1 csspv2 had a better performance in northern china moreover the influence of meteorological forcing is more important in the surface layer while the influence of the model is more important in the middle and deep layers in addition there is no significant seasonal difference in the effect of meteorological forcing data on the simulation results while the csspv2 simulation performs significantly better in the cold season smap product again verified the better performance of cldasv2 0 csspv2 simulation it should be acknowledged that cldasv2 0 csspv2 simulated soil moisture has systematically dry bias for the middle and deep layers at most cma observational stations which may be related to the soil texture related parameters e g soil porosity or other processes more research is needed to understand and improve the bias especially for applications where the absolute soil moisture values are important as a regional land reanalysis over china the forcing datasets of cldasv2 0 are likely to be better calibrated over this region than the global era5 and gldasv2 1 reanalysis benefiting from the assimilation of a large amount of surface observations results from this study will help to choose the most appropriate meteorological forcing product for conducting soil moisture related studies over china however other soil moisture products need to be assessed at a variety of spatial and temporal scales chen and yuan 2020 this study focuses on model validation from the perspective of meteorological data and lsms better performance of the csspv2 model as compared with noah and htessel may be attributed to the consideration of the influence of subgrid topographic variation on the grid mean soil moisture yuan and liang 2010 as the subgrid variability can be comparable to that of mean flux over dry areas such as the northern china in addition our previous research shows the finer resolution land surface datasets e g soil texture data lai and land use category also help improve csspv2 s performance by providing more accurate thermal and hydrological properties ji et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 lastly finer resolution of the soil layer discretization and soil moisture calculation may also have positive contributions further efforts are needed to quantify relative importance of these factors to the csspv2 s improvement credit

4029,groundwater quality is affected by numerous uncertain factors and the evaluation process is liable to randomness and fuzziness to evaluate the quality of groundwater effectively this study proposed a multi index evaluation system termed the modified cloud model level eigenvalue method mcm lem model which is based on cloud model theory in this evaluation system the water quality was classified into five levels and several parameters were selected while the critic objective weight method is used to calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter before an one dimensional normal cloud model and a multi dimensional normal cloud model are established to obtain the membership degree of water samples pertaining to each water quality level finally the lem was used to assess the water quality level in this study taking the groundwater in the urban area of jilin city as an example seven evaluation parameters were selected for water quality evaluation and the water quality evaluation results using the mcm lem model were compared with those obtained via the single factor evaluation method the nemerow index method and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method the evaluation results obtained via the mcm lem model were largely consistent with those obtained via the other methods compared with the other methods the mcm lem model can comprehensively consider the fuzziness and randomness as well as the correlation between them can avoid complex function calculations and can provide more scientific and objective evaluation results furthermore compared with the one dimensional normal cloud model the multi dimensional normal cloud model comprehensively considers multiple evaluation parameters which simplifies the modeling process and reduces the calculation times for the membership degree meanwhile using the lem to determine the water quality level not only overcomes the inapplicability of the maximum membership degree principle but also allows for assessing the relative advantages and disadvantages of different water samples of the same level the proposed method can be used to the evaluation of the groundwater quality in other areas enabling the planning and management of groundwater resources keywords water quality evaluation cloud model level eigenvalue method 1 introduction groundwater plays a crucial role in the supply of water and in ecological environment maintenance around one third of the global population uses groundwater kyaw myint et al 2005 accounting for 20 of the world s daily water supply shi et al 2014 while in china around two thirds of cities use groundwater as a source of drinking water aimin et al 2016 however with the development of the economy the groundwater quality is being gradually deteriorated by the influence of the various industrial and agricultural activities especially in medium and large cities agricultural intensive areas and mineral mining areas there also exist various complex pollution issues such as diverse pollution sources complex pollution components large pollution ranges and high pollutant concentrations under the condition of limited water resources groundwater pollution will directly reduce the available amount of groundwater resources as well as increase the risk to groundwater safety and pose a serious threat to socio economic development individual living standards and the ecological environment jianping et al 2018 wang et al 2018 according to statistics of reported by the ministry of land and resources of the people s republic of china and the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the groundwater in china has been polluted to varying degrees in fact since 2006 there have been frequent groundwater pollution events in china with more than 1700 events every year lv and wei 2016 according to the monthly report on groundwater dynamics published by the ministry of water resources in 2016 around 80 of the shallow groundwater monitoring points in china were substandard at level iv and level v making them unsuitable for human consumption here the main pollutants were three nitrogen fluoride manganese iron heavy metals and other toxic organic compounds therefore in 2018 the unqualified rate of the groundwater monitoring points in china was as high as 86 7 therefore improving the quality of the groundwater environment is crucial while it is of great practical significance to ascertain the groundwater pollution status and to formulate a correct development strategy through carrying out effective groundwater quality evaluation groundwater quality is affected by many factors and the attendant evaluation procedure involves a multi index decision making process since the concept of water quality evaluation was first proposed a series of studies have been carried out on the selection of the water quality evaluation indexes and evaluation methods both at home and abroad the earlier evaluation methods include the single factor evaluation method sfem xin et al 2015 the nemerow index method nim yang et al 2017 since the 1990s various mathematical methods models and computers have been widely used to further expand the water quality evaluation methods including the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method fcem the grey evaluation method the neural network method the support vector machine and the projection pursuit method wang et al 2017 however the above methods all have their own applicable conditions and involve certain limitations the sfem involves evaluating a single water quality index independently and the evaluation standard is too strict and the evaluation results are one sided which means the overall situation of the groundwater quality cannot be fully reflected and large deviations may occur meanwhile the nim involves comprehensively determining the groundwater quality level by giving different weights to each index however this method ignores the fuzziness of the water quality classification boundary and may cover up the existence of water pollution finally the fcem does not consider the relationship between fuzziness and randomness the gray evaluation method involves complex calculations and a low resolution and the neural network method has low accuracy difficult parameter setting slow convergence speed and poor stability while the problem of local minimization can easily emerge which will affect the evaluation results uncertainty is common in nature with fuzziness and randomness as the most basic indexes following further research on this uncertainty li et al 1995 proposed a cloud model based on probability statistics and fuzzy mathematics to overcome the shortcomings of probability theory and fuzzy mathematics in terms of dealing with uncertainty with the cloud model having the capacity to comprehensively consider the fuzziness and randomness as well as the correlation between them li et al 1995 and to establish the transformation between quantitative and qualitative concepts on this basis many scholars have demonstrated and developed the cloud model which has subsequently been applied in various fields including data mining intelligent control and risk assessment ye et al 2011 yang and wang 2020 targeting the uncertainty of water quality evaluation process the cloud model can consider not only the fuzziness and randomness in terms of the random theory and fuzzy set theory but also the nonlinearity of the evaluation criteria and the diversity of the evaluation parameters which ensures that the evaluation results are more reliable yao et al 2021 in 2013 yang wen took the surface water of ninghai county as the research object introduced the entropy weight cloud model comprehensive analysis method to evaluate the surface water quality for the first time and compared the results with those obtained via the sfem and the principal component analysis method which verified the effectiveness and accuracy of the cloud model in the field of water quality evaluation wen 2013 subsequently researchers have gradually introduced the cloud model into the quality evaluation of springs lakes and groundwater with the application and development of the cloud model in the field of water quality evaluation becoming increasingly mature liu et al 2014 wu et al 2021 elsewhere wang xintong et al established a multi index evaluation method based on one dimensional normal cloud model oncm and applied it to the evaluation of spring water quality in jinan city wang et al 2019 while kang xiaobing et al applied the cloud model based water quality evaluation system in conjunction with analytic hierarchy process to a specific area of xichang city with the results indicating that the evaluation system was applicable in the evaluation of groundwater quality kang et al 2019 based on the cloud model theory wang dong wang et al 2016b and others constructed a multi dimensional normal cloud model mncm to evaluate the eutrophication of 12 lakes in china here while the modeling process was simplified it met the complexity of water eutrophication evaluation and had certain advantages over other methods such as the fcem yao et al 2019 and the water quality evaluation results were more in line with the actual situation wang et al 2016a in partial sum the application of cloud model theory to the field of water quality evaluation can resolve the attendant fuzziness and randomness issue and allows for avoiding the tedious calculation process of membership function and thus has great potential in this field the multi index comprehensive evaluation system focuses on determining the weight of each evaluation parameter and evaluating the evaluation object according to the weight the objectivity and accuracy of the weight of each evaluation parameter will directly affect the credibility of the final evaluation results however the subjective weighting method is greatly affected by human factors and the reliability of the weighting results is not high at present most researchers use objective weighting methods such as the critic objective weighting method which allows for analyzing the amount of effective information in the data comprehensively considering the differences and relevance among multiple samples and obtaining more scientific and objective weight values thus providing better results when applied to research the final stage of water quality evaluations involves assessing the water quality level by combining the membership degree and weight here the most commonly used assessment method is the maximum membership degree principle mmdp however when the maximum value of the membership degree of the five water quality levels is less than 0 5 this method is not applicable and the level eigenvalue method lem must be used to overcome this deficiency clearly then the groundwater quality is influenced by numerous factors and the process of water quality evaluation involves great uncertainty while most water quality evaluation methods cannot consider the randomness and fuzziness in the evaluation process meanwhile certain conditions apply when using the mmdp to assess the water quality level therefore it is necessary to devise an effective and accurate water quality evaluation system to evaluate the current situation of groundwater quality this study proposed a multi index evaluation system termed modified cloud model level eigenvalue method mcm lem model based on cloud model theory which allows for comprehensively considering the fuzziness and randomness of the evaluation process using the critic objective weighting method to calculate the weight of each parameter and introducing the cloud model into the groundwater quality evaluation both an oncm and a mncm are established to calculate the membership degree of water samples pertaining to each water quality level with the water quality level is determined by lem finally the evaluation results obtained via the mcm lem system were compared with those obtained via other evaluation methods to verify the reliability of the system with the relative advantages and disadvantages of one dimensional normal cloud model level eigenvalue method oncm lem and the multi dimensional normal cloud model level eigenvalue method mncm lem also compared 2 materials and methods 2 1 data jilin city is located in the transition zone that stretches from changbai mountain to songnen plain in the east of jilin province the working area is 670 km2 with a total population of 2 181 million while the overall terrain is high in the southeast and low in the northwest the average annual precipitation is around 661 7 mm groundwater mainly occurs in the quaternary alluvial and proluvial sediments and is the main groundwater source for the industrial agricultural and domestic water supplies in the area the hydrochemical type is mainly hco3 ca mg while the mineralization degree is generally less than 1000 mg l based on the dynamic monitoring of groundwater in the urban area of jilin city this study selects various water quality monitoring points of loose rock pore phreatic water in 2018 according to the general situation of the study area and the fig 1 show the distribution of groundwater sample points since the groundwater quality is influenced by many factors selecting appropriate evaluation indexes is the key to accurately reflecting the relationship between the regional groundwater quality and the local groundwater environments according to the existing literature on water quality evaluation and the actual situation of groundwater environments it is important to take the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 as the evaluation standard and to select the water quality parameters strictly controlled by the national water quality management requirements which play an important role in the water environment and have a great impact on the environmental ecology in this study seven indicators chloride cl sulfate radical so4 2 chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate no3 total dissolved solids tds and total hardness th

reflect the concept of multi dimensional qualitative let u x1 x2 xm is an m dimensional quantitative universe of discourse expressed by exact numerical value a is qualitative concepts on u x1 x2 xm if

multi index comprehensive evaluation system is to determine the weight of each evaluation parameter the objectivity and accuracy of the weight of each evaluation parameter directly affect the credibility of the final evaluation results subjective weighting method is greatly influenced by human factors and its result is not reliable entropy weight method is a commonly used objective weighting method which is calculated according to the difference of each evaluation parameter but there are not only differences but also correlations between the evaluation parameters critic is an objective weighting method proposed by diakoulaki in 1995 the basis of weighting depends on the value of the same evaluation parameters in different schemes and the conflict between them in the process of weighting standard deviation and correlation are used as the comparison criteria respectively finally the information amount of different evaluation parameters is calculated that is the weight value the weighting method comprehensively considers the differences and correlations of each evaluation parameters and the weight obtained is more objective and accurate diakoulaki et al 1995 the main steps are as follows 1 determine the standard deviation of each evaluation parameter 8 σ i 1 m i 1 m a i a 2 2 where m is the number of samples ai is the value of the sample a is the average value of m samples 2 determine the correlation coefficient between evaluation parameters a and b 9 ρ ab i 1 m a i a b i b i 1 m a i a 2 i 1 m b i b 2 2 where ρ ab is the correlation coefficient of a and b b i is the value of the sample b is the average value of m samples 3 calculation of information quantity 10 g i σ i i 1 n 1 ρ ij 4 calculate the objective weight value 11 w i g i i 1 n g i 2 2 3 level eigenvalue method lem the traditional comprehensive evaluation method of water quality is based on the mmdp but it cannot be used when bmax 0 5 in this paper the lem is introduced to determine the result each component of the evaluation result vector is multiplied by the rank of the corresponding level to obtain the relative position of the evaluation object this method uses all the membership information and the conclusion is more in line with the actual situation dong et al 2019 dong et al 2020 the calculation formula is as follows 12 h k 1 5 b k k k 1 5 b k h is the level eigenvalue index if h is greater than the intermediate value of the two levels it is considered that the water quality level belongs to the next level if h is less than the intermediate value it belongs to the previous level 2 3 evaluation framework based on the cloud model theory this study proposes a water quality evaluation system termed the modified cloud model level eigenvalue method with the evaluation process as follows and the fig 2 select the appropriate evaluation criteria determine the scope of the evaluation parameters pertaining to each water quality level and calculate the cloud parameters ex en he calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter using the critic objective weighting method establish an oncm and a mncm to calculate the membership degree of the water samples pertaining to each water quality level assess the water quality level via the lem 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation results of the modified cloud model level eigenvalue method as noted groundwater quality evaluations involve some uncertainty meaning it is necessary to introduce both the oncm and the mncn to consider the randomness and fuzziness in the evaluation process in this paper the groundwater quality of the study area was evaluated in terms of the following steps 3 1 1 evaluation process of the one dimensional normal cloud model level eigenvalue method oncm lem 1 select evaluation criteria and calculate cloud parameters to determine the water quality level the corresponding range must be defined with each level corresponding to a quantitative universe of discourse according to the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 the water quality is divided into five levels with the definition of each level shown in table 1 the cloud model of the universe of discourse was established using specific cloud parameters ex en he such that the water quality level divided into numbers has the characteristics of fuzziness again the cloud parameters were determined based on the upper and lower limit concentration of the evaluation parameters specified in the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 table 2 combined with eqs 2 4 with the results shown in table 3 finally 5000 cloud drops were generated by running matlab software and cloud images of the evaluation parameters pertaining to each water quality level were drawn as shown in fig 3 with images of seven evaluation parameters cl so4 2 tds th nh3 n no3 and cod pertaining to five water quality levels level i ii iii iv and ⅴ 2 calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter given the relativity of the evaluation parameters the critic objective weighting method was used to calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter which reduced the influence of human factors overcame the shortcomings of the subjective weighting method and comprehensively considered the conflict among multiple evaluation parameters according to the eqs 8 11 the water quality monitoring data was treated in dimensionless terms and the standard deviation correlation coefficient and information value of each evaluation parameter were calculated to obtain the weight w of each evaluation parameter the results are shown in table 4 the relative importance of the seven evaluation parameters from high to low was tds nh4 no3 cl so4 2 th cod 3 based on the theory of the oncm the membership matrix is generated combined with the cloud parameters and the measured concentrations of each evaluation parameter the membership degree of seven evaluation parameters pertaining to the five water quality levels was calculated by using matlab software with the membership matrix subsequently generated 4 determine the water quality level the membership matrix and the weight vector were multiplied to calculate the membership degree of the sample pertaining to the five water quality levels and the level eigenvalue index of the samples was calculated via the lem here if h was greater than the intermediate value of the two levels the water quality level was deemed to pertain to the next level while if h was less than the intermediate value it pertained to the previous level 3 1 2 evaluation process of the multi dimensional normal cloud model level eigenvalue method mncm lem the steps of using the mncm lem model to evaluate groundwater quality more consistent with those of the oncm lem according to the selected seven evaluation parameters and their evaluation criteria the three cloud parameters of the mncm table 5 were determined the weight of each evaluation parameter was determined using the critic objective weighting method table 4 then the mncm covering all evaluation parameters was generated and the water quality was determined via the lem 3 1 3 evaluation results of the water quality in the study area the oncm lem and mncm lem models were used to calculate the level eigenvalue index of each sample point from 2016 to 2018 with the temporal variability shown in fig 4 the water quality level of the sample point was determined according to the level eigenvalue index where if the index was greater than the intermediate value of the two levels the water quality level was deemed to pertain to the next level while if the index was less than the intermediate value it pertained to the previous level the level eigenvalue index range of each sample point in the study area from 2016 to 2018 calculated via the oncm lem was 1 99 3 62 2 06 3 36 and 1 86 3 69 respectively the water quality levels in the three year period were mainly levels ii and iii of which level iii accounted for 75 65 and 45 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively meanwhile the level eigenvalue index range of each sample point in the study area in 2016 2018 calculated via the mncm lem was 2 31 2 73 2 23 2 85 and 2 24 3 16 respectively the water quality levels in the three year period were mainly levels ii and iii of which level iii accounted for 50 25 and 25 for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the level characteristic index of 75 for the sample points exhibited a downward trend therefore in terms of both the overall situation of the study area and the change trend of each point the water quality of the study area improved year on year in the period of 2016 2018 the spatial distribution of the water quality level was drawn according to the evaluation results obtained via the oncm lem and mncm lem as shown in fig 5 here it was clear that the sample points with a poor water quality level were mainly concentrated in areas with frequent human activities while the sample points close to surface rivers and far from human gathering places had good water quality the overall water quality in the northwest of the study area was worse than that in the southeast this was perhaps because the groundwater flowing from the southeast to the northwest of the study area carries pollutants from the upstream to the downstream where they accumulate fig 6 shows the statistical results for the percentage of evaluation parameters pertaining to the five levels obtained using the oncm lem for the period of 2016 2017 here it was clear that the sample points with the measured concentration of cl and so4 2 not exceeding the standard of level ii accounted for 85 85 and 95 for the period of 2016 2017 meanwhile the samples with the concentrations of nh3 n no3 tds th and cod exceeding the standard of level iii accounted for 35 40 30 20 and 15 respectively in 2016 for 30 30 10 10 and 20 respectively in 2017 and for 15 20 45 10 and 10 respectively in 2018 therefore nh3 n and no3 are the main parameters causing the gradual deterioration of the water quality 3 2 comparative analysis of different water quality evaluation methods in order to verify the reliability of the mcm lem model its evaluation results were compared with those of the sfem the nim and the fcem with the results shown in table 6 compared with other comprehensive evaluation methods the results of sfem indicated that the percentages of samples with a water quality level classified as level iii and level iv were up to 35 and 51 7 respectively this was because the sfem takes the highest level of the evaluation parameter as the whole groundwater quality level while the evaluation standard is strict which leads to the negative side of the evaluation results xin et al 2015 however compared with various other comprehensive evaluation methods the sfem reduces the risk of accepting poor water quality and is regarded as a safer evaluation method shan et al 2018 the fcem the oncm lem and the mncm lem will calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter which will not have a great impact on the evaluation results owing to the large scale change in the concentration of an evaluation parameter while the evaluation results will be more stable wang et al 2016c as table 6 shows the evaluation results obtained via the fcem the oncm lem and the mncm lem were largely similar while compared with those of the oncm lem and mncm lem the evaluation results of the fcem tended to be better with the exception of a few points for example the water quality of sample point 13 in 2018 was determined to be level ⅴ using the sfem while it was determined to be level iii via the fcem and level iv via the oncm lem by analyzing the concentration of each evaluation parameter it was found that the concentration of six evaluation parameters did not exceed the standard of level ii with only the concentration of nh4 2 28 mg l seriously exceeding the standard of level v therefore considering the impact of the parameters with a high concentration on the water environment the evaluation results obtained via the oncm lem were more accurate than those obtained via the fcem nim is an early comprehensive water quality evaluation method which is widely used yang et al 2017 the evaluation results of the mcm lem were highly similar to those obtained via the nim which confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation system in addition compared with that via the mncm lem model the water quality level described via the nim is discontinuous with the classification standard based on binary logic this discontinuity will result in concentration values with a small difference falling within two completely different water quality levels and concentration values with a large difference falling in the same level luo and jia 2018 however the cloud model can make the division of the water quality level fuzzy again thus overcoming the above defects while the fcem can be used for the comprehensive evaluation of water quality the influence of the uncertainty factors on the evaluation results will not be eliminated liu and zou 2012 in addition taking nh4 as an example the limit between level i and level ii is 0 02 mg l when the measured concentration is 0 01 or 0 03 mg l the influence of the two concentrations on the water quality is not different under actual conditions but the fcem still involves different functions to calculate the membership degree and the difference cannot be ignored however the mcm lem transforms the accurate water quality classification standard into a cloud composed of multiple cloud drops making the division of the water quality level fuzzy again with the cloud parameters used to characterize the fuzziness and randomness of the water quality classification the measured concentration of the evaluation parameter is taken as the cloud drops in the cloud and the membership degree of the evaluation parameter is generated using matlab software which is random each time but the results will be stable within a reasonable range reflecting the uncertainty of the evaluation process wen 2013 finally the accuracy of the membership degree is improved by calculating the average value of repeated measurements to make it more practically applicable lei and xiong 2019 thus the mcm lem not only realizes the combination of fuzziness and randomness but also avoids the complex function calculation process and improves the evaluation efficiency which ensure that the evaluation results are more scientific and objective a total of 63 3 of the evaluation results obtained via the mncm lem were consistent with the oncm lem 63 3 are consistent with those obtained via the fcem while all the other evaluation results were highly similar which confirmed the effectiveness of the mncm in groundwater quality evaluation in brief the mncm is an extension of the oncm and compared with the latter the former considers multiple evaluation parameters and takes each evaluation parameter as a dimension to build a cloud model while these two models are consistent in term of evaluation criteria evaluation parameters and determination of water quality there exist various differences in the evaluation process the first of which relates to the calculation of the cloud parameters the physical meaning of en is the range of cloud drops that can be accepted by qualitative concept while it also refers to the range of water quality levels covered by a qualitative cloud in the oncm the entropy en must be calculated for each water quality level and this value only covers the adjacent water quality level however the determination of the entropy en of mncm involves considering the five water quality levels taking one third of the expectation ex of the highest water quality level as the entropy with the en via the each water quality level the same wang et al 2016a b in addition the determination method of he is similar to that of en in the oncm values of he for different water quality levels are different while they are the same in the mncm meanwhile the second difference relates to the calculation of the membership degree in the modeling process of oncm the cloud model must be established for each evaluation parameter hat pertains to each water quality level in this study seven evaluation parameters were selected to establish 35 one dimensional normal cloud models however the mncm only needs to establish a multi dimensional model considering seven evaluation parameters for each water quality level so there are five models in total clearly the mncm not only simplifies the modeling process but also reduces the time of calculation for membership degree wang et al 2016a b as table 6 shows 63 3 of the evaluation results obtained via the mncm lem model were the same as those obtained via the oncm lem model while the water quality level calculated via the mncm lem model in the remaining 36 7 of the samples was different from that calculated via the oncm lem fig 7 shows the level eigenvalue index of the samples from 2016 to 2018 as calculated via the oncm lem and mncm lem here it was clear that the calculation results of the two methods are different specifically the mncm lem takes into account the synergistic and antagonistic effects among various parameters affecting the water quality in the process of water quality evaluation before ultimately scientifically evaluating the water quality level 3 3 comparative analysis of two assessment methods for water quality level in the process of traditional water quality evaluation the water quality level is generally determined based on the principle of mmdp table 7 and table 8 show results of water quality level obtained via the oncm and the mncm respectively however this method only considers the information regarding the maximum value of the membership degree while it ignores the contribution of other membership degrees for example the normalized comprehensive membership degrees of sample point 1 in the evaluation results of mncm lem were 0 3034 0 3003 0 2544 0 1343 and 0 0075 in table 8 with the maximum value of membership degree 0 3034 which is less than 0 5 while the membership degrees of level ii and level i were very close with the difference being less than 0 003 there is the problem of discomfort when using the mmdp to assess the water quality level therefore in this study the lem was used to determine the water quality level with more reasonable and reliable results in addition the mmdp assessment results present a clear water quality level and it is impossible to compare the water quality of different water samples with the same water quality level however the level eigenvalue index must be calculated when using the lem and the smaller the value the better the water quality which can be used to compare the water quality of samples with the same water quality level dong et al 2019 fig 8 shows the water quality level and the level eigenvalue index of each sample point from 2016 to 2018 as calculated via the oncm lem and mncm lem here the water quality levels of sample points 1 3 and 4 fig 8 1 and sample points 1 3 4 17 19 and 20 fig 8 2 were the same however using the level eigenvalue index of the sample it could be concluded that the water quality continuously improved from 2016 to 2018 4 conclusion there is great uncertainty involved in groundwater quality assessment due to the influence of numerous factors based on the cloud model theory this study proposed a water quality evaluation system using the measured data of groundwater in jilin city the oncm and mncm that consider seven evaluation parameters were established the critic objective weighting method was used to calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter while the lem was used to determine the groundwater quality level the evaluation results obtained via mcm lem were compared with those obtained via other evaluation methods with the relative advantages and disadvantages of the lem and mmdp analyzed the conclusions are as follows 1 the evaluation results obtained via the mcm lem model were largely consistent with those obtained via the other evaluation methods which demonstrated the reliability of the model in water quality evaluation 2 the mcm lem transforms the accurate water quality classification standard into a cloud composed of multiple cloud drops making the division of the water quality level fuzzy again with the fuzziness and randomness of the water quality classification characterized by the cloud parameters following this the measured concentration of the evaluation parameter is taken as the cloud drops in the cloud and the random membership degree of the evaluation parameter is generated via matlab software which not only realizes the combination of fuzziness and randomness but also avoids the complex function calculation process and improves the evaluation efficiency ensuring that the evaluation results are more scientific and objective furthermore the mncm considers multiple evaluation parameters which reduces the time for establishing the normal cloud model and calculating the membership without increasing the complexity of the model making the evaluation process more concise and clearer 3 using the lem to determine the water quality level overcomes the inapplicability of the traditional determination method mmdp and considers the contribution of all membership degrees ensuring that the evaluation results are more scientific and reasonable at the same time it can also assess the better one among different water samples with the same water quality level credit authorship contribution statement dongmei ruan conceptualization methodology software

4029,groundwater quality is affected by numerous uncertain factors and the evaluation process is liable to randomness and fuzziness to evaluate the quality of groundwater effectively this study proposed a multi index evaluation system termed the modified cloud model level eigenvalue method mcm lem model which is based on cloud model theory in this evaluation system the water quality was classified into five levels and several parameters were selected while the critic objective weight method is used to calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter before an one dimensional normal cloud model and a multi dimensional normal cloud model are established to obtain the membership degree of water samples pertaining to each water quality level finally the lem was used to assess the water quality level in this study taking the groundwater in the urban area of jilin city as an example seven evaluation parameters were selected for water quality evaluation and the water quality evaluation results using the mcm lem model were compared with those obtained via the single factor evaluation method the nemerow index method and the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method the evaluation results obtained via the mcm lem model were largely consistent with those obtained via the other methods compared with the other methods the mcm lem model can comprehensively consider the fuzziness and randomness as well as the correlation between them can avoid complex function calculations and can provide more scientific and objective evaluation results furthermore compared with the one dimensional normal cloud model the multi dimensional normal cloud model comprehensively considers multiple evaluation parameters which simplifies the modeling process and reduces the calculation times for the membership degree meanwhile using the lem to determine the water quality level not only overcomes the inapplicability of the maximum membership degree principle but also allows for assessing the relative advantages and disadvantages of different water samples of the same level the proposed method can be used to the evaluation of the groundwater quality in other areas enabling the planning and management of groundwater resources keywords water quality evaluation cloud model level eigenvalue method 1 introduction groundwater plays a crucial role in the supply of water and in ecological environment maintenance around one third of the global population uses groundwater kyaw myint et al 2005 accounting for 20 of the world s daily water supply shi et al 2014 while in china around two thirds of cities use groundwater as a source of drinking water aimin et al 2016 however with the development of the economy the groundwater quality is being gradually deteriorated by the influence of the various industrial and agricultural activities especially in medium and large cities agricultural intensive areas and mineral mining areas there also exist various complex pollution issues such as diverse pollution sources complex pollution components large pollution ranges and high pollutant concentrations under the condition of limited water resources groundwater pollution will directly reduce the available amount of groundwater resources as well as increase the risk to groundwater safety and pose a serious threat to socio economic development individual living standards and the ecological environment jianping et al 2018 wang et al 2018 according to statistics of reported by the ministry of land and resources of the people s republic of china and the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china the groundwater in china has been polluted to varying degrees in fact since 2006 there have been frequent groundwater pollution events in china with more than 1700 events every year lv and wei 2016 according to the monthly report on groundwater dynamics published by the ministry of water resources in 2016 around 80 of the shallow groundwater monitoring points in china were substandard at level iv and level v making them unsuitable for human consumption here the main pollutants were three nitrogen fluoride manganese iron heavy metals and other toxic organic compounds therefore in 2018 the unqualified rate of the groundwater monitoring points in china was as high as 86 7 therefore improving the quality of the groundwater environment is crucial while it is of great practical significance to ascertain the groundwater pollution status and to formulate a correct development strategy through carrying out effective groundwater quality evaluation groundwater quality is affected by many factors and the attendant evaluation procedure involves a multi index decision making process since the concept of water quality evaluation was first proposed a series of studies have been carried out on the selection of the water quality evaluation indexes and evaluation methods both at home and abroad the earlier evaluation methods include the single factor evaluation method sfem xin et al 2015 the nemerow index method nim yang et al 2017 since the 1990s various mathematical methods models and computers have been widely used to further expand the water quality evaluation methods including the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method fcem the grey evaluation method the neural network method the support vector machine and the projection pursuit method wang et al 2017 however the above methods all have their own applicable conditions and involve certain limitations the sfem involves evaluating a single water quality index independently and the evaluation standard is too strict and the evaluation results are one sided which means the overall situation of the groundwater quality cannot be fully reflected and large deviations may occur meanwhile the nim involves comprehensively determining the groundwater quality level by giving different weights to each index however this method ignores the fuzziness of the water quality classification boundary and may cover up the existence of water pollution finally the fcem does not consider the relationship between fuzziness and randomness the gray evaluation method involves complex calculations and a low resolution and the neural network method has low accuracy difficult parameter setting slow convergence speed and poor stability while the problem of local minimization can easily emerge which will affect the evaluation results uncertainty is common in nature with fuzziness and randomness as the most basic indexes following further research on this uncertainty li et al 1995 proposed a cloud model based on probability statistics and fuzzy mathematics to overcome the shortcomings of probability theory and fuzzy mathematics in terms of dealing with uncertainty with the cloud model having the capacity to comprehensively consider the fuzziness and randomness as well as the correlation between them li et al 1995 and to establish the transformation between quantitative and qualitative concepts on this basis many scholars have demonstrated and developed the cloud model which has subsequently been applied in various fields including data mining intelligent control and risk assessment ye et al 2011 yang and wang 2020 targeting the uncertainty of water quality evaluation process the cloud model can consider not only the fuzziness and randomness in terms of the random theory and fuzzy set theory but also the nonlinearity of the evaluation criteria and the diversity of the evaluation parameters which ensures that the evaluation results are more reliable yao et al 2021 in 2013 yang wen took the surface water of ninghai county as the research object introduced the entropy weight cloud model comprehensive analysis method to evaluate the surface water quality for the first time and compared the results with those obtained via the sfem and the principal component analysis method which verified the effectiveness and accuracy of the cloud model in the field of water quality evaluation wen 2013 subsequently researchers have gradually introduced the cloud model into the quality evaluation of springs lakes and groundwater with the application and development of the cloud model in the field of water quality evaluation becoming increasingly mature liu et al 2014 wu et al 2021 elsewhere wang xintong et al established a multi index evaluation method based on one dimensional normal cloud model oncm and applied it to the evaluation of spring water quality in jinan city wang et al 2019 while kang xiaobing et al applied the cloud model based water quality evaluation system in conjunction with analytic hierarchy process to a specific area of xichang city with the results indicating that the evaluation system was applicable in the evaluation of groundwater quality kang et al 2019 based on the cloud model theory wang dong wang et al 2016b and others constructed a multi dimensional normal cloud model mncm to evaluate the eutrophication of 12 lakes in china here while the modeling process was simplified it met the complexity of water eutrophication evaluation and had certain advantages over other methods such as the fcem yao et al 2019 and the water quality evaluation results were more in line with the actual situation wang et al 2016a in partial sum the application of cloud model theory to the field of water quality evaluation can resolve the attendant fuzziness and randomness issue and allows for avoiding the tedious calculation process of membership function and thus has great potential in this field the multi index comprehensive evaluation system focuses on determining the weight of each evaluation parameter and evaluating the evaluation object according to the weight the objectivity and accuracy of the weight of each evaluation parameter will directly affect the credibility of the final evaluation results however the subjective weighting method is greatly affected by human factors and the reliability of the weighting results is not high at present most researchers use objective weighting methods such as the critic objective weighting method which allows for analyzing the amount of effective information in the data comprehensively considering the differences and relevance among multiple samples and obtaining more scientific and objective weight values thus providing better results when applied to research the final stage of water quality evaluations involves assessing the water quality level by combining the membership degree and weight here the most commonly used assessment method is the maximum membership degree principle mmdp however when the maximum value of the membership degree of the five water quality levels is less than 0 5 this method is not applicable and the level eigenvalue method lem must be used to overcome this deficiency clearly then the groundwater quality is influenced by numerous factors and the process of water quality evaluation involves great uncertainty while most water quality evaluation methods cannot consider the randomness and fuzziness in the evaluation process meanwhile certain conditions apply when using the mmdp to assess the water quality level therefore it is necessary to devise an effective and accurate water quality evaluation system to evaluate the current situation of groundwater quality this study proposed a multi index evaluation system termed modified cloud model level eigenvalue method mcm lem model based on cloud model theory which allows for comprehensively considering the fuzziness and randomness of the evaluation process using the critic objective weighting method to calculate the weight of each parameter and introducing the cloud model into the groundwater quality evaluation both an oncm and a mncm are established to calculate the membership degree of water samples pertaining to each water quality level with the water quality level is determined by lem finally the evaluation results obtained via the mcm lem system were compared with those obtained via other evaluation methods to verify the reliability of the system with the relative advantages and disadvantages of one dimensional normal cloud model level eigenvalue method oncm lem and the multi dimensional normal cloud model level eigenvalue method mncm lem also compared 2 materials and methods

phreatic water in 2018 according to the general situation of the study area and the fig 1 show the distribution of groundwater sample points since the groundwater quality is influenced by many factors selecting appropriate evaluation indexes is the key to accurately reflecting the relationship between the regional groundwater quality and the local groundwater environments according to the existing literature on water quality evaluation and the actual situation of groundwater environments it is important to take the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 as the evaluation standard and to select the water quality parameters strictly controlled by the national water quality management requirements which play an important role in the water environment and have a great impact on the

reflect the concept of multi dimensional qualitative let u x1 x2 xm is an m dimensional quantitative universe of discourse expressed by exact numerical value a is qualitative concepts on u x1 x2 xm if

multi index comprehensive evaluation system is to determine the weight of each evaluation parameter the objectivity and accuracy of the weight of each evaluation parameter directly affect the credibility of the final evaluation results subjective weighting method is greatly influenced by human factors and its result is not reliable entropy weight method is a commonly used objective weighting method which is calculated according to the difference of each evaluation parameter but there are not only differences but also correlations between the evaluation parameters critic is an objective weighting method proposed by diakoulaki in 1995 the basis of weighting depends on the value of the same evaluation parameters in different schemes and the conflict between them in the process of weighting standard deviation and correlation are used as the comparison criteria respectively finally the information amount of different evaluation parameters is calculated that is the weight value the weighting method comprehensively considers the differences and correlations of each evaluation parameters and the weight obtained is more objective and accurate diakoulaki et al 1995 the main steps are as follows 1 determine the standard deviation of each evaluation parameter 8 σ i 1 m i 1 m a i a 2 2 where m is the number of samples ai is the value of the sample a is the average value of m samples 2 determine the correlation coefficient between evaluation parameters a and b 9 ρ ab i 1 m a i a b i b i 1 m a i a 2 i 1 m b i b 2 2 where ρ ab is the correlation coefficient of a and b b i is the value of the sample b is the average value of m samples 3 calculation of information quantity 10 g i σ i i 1 n 1 ρ ij 4 calculate the objective weight value 11 w i g i i 1 n g i 2 2 3 level eigenvalue method lem the traditional comprehensive evaluation method of water quality is based on the mmdp but it cannot be used when bmax 0 5 in this paper the lem is introduced to determine the result each component of the evaluation result vector is multiplied by the rank of the corresponding level to obtain the relative position of the evaluation object this method uses all the membership information and the conclusion is more in line with the actual situation dong et al 2019 dong et al 2020 the calculation formula is as follows 12 h k 1 5 b k k k 1 5 b k h is the level eigenvalue index if h is greater than the intermediate value of the two levels it is considered that the water quality level belongs to the next level if h is less than the intermediate value it belongs to the previous level 2 3 evaluation framework based on the cloud model theory this study proposes a water quality evaluation system termed the modified cloud model level eigenvalue method with the evaluation process as follows and the fig 2 select the appropriate evaluation criteria determine the scope of the evaluation parameters pertaining to each water quality level and calculate the cloud parameters ex en he calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter using the critic objective weighting method establish an oncm and a mncm to calculate the membership degree of the water samples pertaining to each water quality level assess the water quality level via the lem 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation results of the modified cloud model level eigenvalue method as noted groundwater quality evaluations involve some uncertainty meaning it is necessary to introduce both the oncm and the mncn to consider the randomness and fuzziness in the evaluation process in this paper the groundwater quality of the study area was evaluated in terms of the following steps 3 1 1 evaluation process of the one dimensional normal cloud model level eigenvalue method oncm lem 1 select evaluation criteria and calculate cloud parameters to determine the water quality level the corresponding range must be defined with each level corresponding to a quantitative universe of discourse according to the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 the water quality is divided into five levels with the definition of each level shown in table 1 the cloud model of the universe of discourse was established using specific cloud parameters ex en he such that the water quality level divided into numbers has the characteristics of fuzziness again the cloud parameters were determined based on the upper and lower limit concentration of the evaluation parameters specified in the standard for groundwater quality gb t 14848 2017 table 2 combined with eqs 2 4 with the results shown in table 3 finally 5000 cloud drops were generated by running matlab software and cloud images of the evaluation parameters pertaining to each water quality level were drawn as shown in fig 3 with images of seven evaluation parameters cl so4 2 tds th nh3 n no3 and cod pertaining to five water quality levels level i ii iii iv and ⅴ 2 calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter given the relativity of the evaluation parameters the critic objective weighting method was used to calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter which reduced the influence of human factors overcame the shortcomings of the subjective weighting method and comprehensively considered the conflict among multiple evaluation parameters according to the eqs 8 11 the water quality monitoring data was treated in dimensionless terms and the standard deviation correlation coefficient and information value of each evaluation parameter were calculated to obtain the weight w of each evaluation parameter the results are shown in table 4 the relative importance of the seven evaluation parameters from high to low was tds nh4 no3 cl so4 2 th cod 3 based on the theory of the oncm the membership matrix is generated combined with the cloud parameters and the measured concentrations of each evaluation parameter the membership degree of seven evaluation parameters pertaining to the five water quality levels was calculated by using matlab software with the membership matrix subsequently generated 4 determine the water quality level the membership matrix and the weight vector were multiplied to calculate the membership degree of the sample pertaining to the five water quality levels and the level eigenvalue index of the samples was calculated via the lem here if h was greater than the intermediate value of the two levels the water quality level was deemed to pertain to the next level while if h was less than the intermediate value it pertained to the previous level 3 1 2 evaluation process of the multi dimensional normal cloud model level eigenvalue method mncm lem the steps of using the mncm lem model to evaluate groundwater quality more consistent with those of the oncm lem according to the selected seven evaluation parameters and their evaluation criteria the three cloud parameters of the mncm table 5 were determined the weight of each evaluation parameter was determined using the critic objective weighting method table 4 then the mncm covering all evaluation parameters was generated and the water quality was determined via the lem 3 1 3 evaluation results of the water quality in the study area the oncm lem and mncm lem models were used to calculate the level eigenvalue index of each sample point from 2016 to 2018 with the temporal variability shown in fig 4 the water quality level of the sample point was determined according to the level eigenvalue index where if the index was greater than the intermediate value of the two levels the water quality level was deemed to pertain to the next level while if the index was less than the intermediate value it pertained to the previous level the level eigenvalue index range of each sample point in the study area from 2016 to 2018 calculated via the oncm lem was 1 99 3 62 2 06 3 36 and 1 86 3 69 respectively the water quality levels in the three year period were mainly levels ii and iii of which level iii accounted for 75 65 and 45 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively meanwhile the level eigenvalue index range of each sample point in the study area in 2016 2018 calculated via the mncm lem was 2 31 2 73 2 23 2 85 and 2 24 3 16 respectively the water quality levels in the three year period were mainly levels ii and iii of which level iii accounted for 50 25 and 25 for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the level characteristic index of 75 for the sample points exhibited a downward trend therefore in terms of both the overall situation of the study area and the change trend of each point the water quality of the study area improved year on year in the period of 2016 2018 the spatial distribution of the water quality level was drawn according to the evaluation results obtained via the oncm lem and mncm lem as shown in fig 5 here it was clear that the sample points with a poor water quality level were mainly concentrated in areas with frequent human activities while the sample points close to surface rivers and far from human gathering places had good water quality the overall water quality in the northwest of the study area was worse than that in the southeast this was perhaps because the groundwater flowing from the southeast to the northwest of the study area carries pollutants from the upstream to the downstream where they accumulate fig 6 shows the statistical results for the percentage of evaluation parameters pertaining to the five levels obtained using the oncm lem for the period of 2016 2017 here it was clear that the sample points with the measured concentration of cl and so4 2 not exceeding the standard of level ii accounted for 85 85 and 95 for the period of 2016 2017 meanwhile the samples with the concentrations of nh3 n no3 tds th and cod exceeding the standard of level iii accounted for 35 40 30 20 and 15 respectively in 2016 for 30 30 10 10 and 20 respectively in 2017 and for 15 20 45 10 and 10 respectively in 2018 therefore nh3 n and no3 are the main parameters causing the gradual deterioration of the water quality 3 2 comparative analysis of different water quality evaluation methods in order to verify the reliability of the mcm lem model its evaluation results were compared with those of the sfem the nim and the fcem with the results shown in table 6 compared with other comprehensive evaluation methods the results of sfem indicated that the percentages of samples with a water quality level classified as level iii and level iv were up to 35 and 51 7 respectively this was because the sfem takes the highest level of the evaluation parameter as the whole groundwater quality level while the evaluation standard is strict which leads to the negative side of the evaluation results xin et al 2015 however compared with various other comprehensive evaluation methods the sfem reduces the risk of accepting poor water quality and is regarded as a safer evaluation method shan et al 2018 the fcem the oncm lem and the mncm lem will calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter which will not have a great impact on the evaluation results owing to the large scale change in the concentration of an evaluation parameter while the evaluation results will be more stable wang et al 2016c as table 6 shows the evaluation results obtained via the fcem the oncm lem and the mncm lem were largely similar while compared with those of the oncm lem and mncm lem the evaluation results of the fcem tended to be better with the exception of a few points for example the water quality of sample point 13 in 2018 was determined to be level ⅴ using the sfem while it was determined to be level iii via the fcem and level iv via the oncm lem by analyzing the concentration of each evaluation parameter it was found that the concentration of six evaluation parameters did not exceed the standard of level ii with only the concentration of nh4 2 28 mg l seriously exceeding the standard of level v therefore considering the impact of the parameters with a high concentration on the water environment the evaluation results obtained via the oncm lem were more accurate than those obtained via the fcem nim is an early comprehensive water quality evaluation method which is widely used yang et al 2017 the evaluation results of the mcm lem were highly similar to those obtained via the nim which confirmed the accuracy and reliability of the evaluation system in addition compared with that via the mncm lem model the water quality level described via the nim is discontinuous with the classification standard based on binary logic this discontinuity will result in concentration values with a small difference falling within two completely different water quality levels and concentration values with a large difference falling in the same level luo and jia 2018 however the cloud model can make the division of the water quality level fuzzy again thus overcoming the above defects while the fcem can be used for the comprehensive evaluation of water quality the influence of the uncertainty factors on the evaluation results will not be eliminated liu and zou 2012 in addition taking nh4 as an example the limit between level i and level ii is 0 02 mg l when the measured concentration is 0 01 or 0 03 mg l the influence of the two concentrations on the water quality is not different under actual conditions but the fcem still involves different functions to calculate the membership degree and the difference cannot be ignored however the mcm lem transforms the accurate water quality classification standard into a cloud composed of multiple cloud drops making the division of the water quality level fuzzy again with the cloud parameters used to characterize the fuzziness and randomness of the water quality classification the measured concentration of the evaluation parameter is taken as the cloud drops in the cloud and the membership degree of the evaluation parameter is generated using matlab software which is random each time but the results will be stable within a reasonable range reflecting the uncertainty of the evaluation process wen 2013 finally the accuracy of the membership degree is improved by calculating the average value of repeated measurements to make it more practically applicable lei and xiong 2019 thus the mcm lem not only realizes the combination of fuzziness and randomness but also avoids the complex function calculation process and improves the evaluation efficiency which ensure that the evaluation results are more scientific and objective a total of 63 3 of the evaluation results obtained via the mncm lem were consistent with the oncm lem 63 3 are consistent with those obtained via the fcem while all the other evaluation results were highly similar which confirmed the effectiveness of the mncm in groundwater quality evaluation in brief the mncm is an extension of the oncm and compared with the latter the former considers multiple evaluation parameters and takes each evaluation parameter as a dimension to build a cloud model while these two models are consistent in term of evaluation criteria evaluation parameters and determination of water quality there exist various differences in the evaluation process the first of which relates to the calculation of the cloud parameters the physical meaning of en is the range of cloud drops that can be accepted by qualitative concept while it also refers to the range of water quality levels covered by a qualitative cloud in the oncm the entropy en must be calculated for each water quality level and this value only covers the adjacent water quality level however the determination of the entropy en of mncm involves considering the five water quality levels taking one third of the expectation ex of the highest water quality level as the entropy with the en via the each water quality level the same wang et al 2016a b in addition the determination method of he is similar to that of en in the oncm values of he for different water quality levels are different while they are the same in the mncm meanwhile the second difference relates to the calculation of the membership degree in the modeling process of oncm the cloud model must be established for each evaluation parameter hat pertains to each water quality level in this study seven evaluation parameters were selected to establish 35 one dimensional normal cloud models however the mncm only needs to establish a multi dimensional model considering seven evaluation parameters for each water quality level so there are five models in total clearly the mncm not only simplifies the modeling process but also reduces the time of calculation for membership degree wang et al 2016a b as table 6 shows 63 3 of the evaluation results obtained via the mncm lem model were the same as those obtained via the oncm lem model while the water quality level calculated via the mncm lem model in the remaining 36 7 of the samples was different from that calculated via the oncm lem fig 7 shows the level eigenvalue index of the samples from 2016 to 2018 as calculated via the oncm lem and mncm lem here it was clear that the calculation results of the two methods are different specifically the mncm lem takes into account the synergistic and antagonistic effects among various parameters affecting the water quality in the process of water quality evaluation before ultimately scientifically evaluating the water quality level 3 3 comparative analysis of two assessment methods for water quality level in the process of traditional water quality evaluation the water quality level is generally determined based on the principle of mmdp table 7 and table 8 show results of water quality level obtained via the oncm and the mncm respectively however this method only considers the information regarding the maximum value of the membership degree while it ignores the contribution of other membership degrees for example the normalized comprehensive membership degrees of sample point 1 in the evaluation results of mncm lem were 0 3034 0 3003 0 2544 0 1343 and 0 0075 in table 8 with the maximum value of membership degree 0 3034 which is less than 0 5 while the membership degrees of level ii and level i were very close with the difference being less than 0 003 there is the problem of discomfort when using the mmdp to assess the water quality level therefore in this study the lem was used to determine the water quality level with more reasonable and reliable results in addition the mmdp assessment results present a clear water quality level and it is impossible to compare the water quality of different water samples with the same water quality level however the level eigenvalue index must be calculated when using the lem and the smaller the value the better the water quality which can be used to compare the water quality of samples with the same water quality level dong et al 2019 fig 8 shows the water quality level and the level eigenvalue index of each sample point from 2016 to 2018 as calculated via the oncm lem and mncm lem here the water quality levels of sample points 1 3 and 4 fig 8 1 and sample points 1 3 4 17 19 and 20 fig 8 2 were the same however using the level eigenvalue index of the sample it could be concluded that the water quality continuously improved from 2016 to 2018 4 conclusion there is great uncertainty involved in groundwater quality assessment due to the influence of numerous factors based on the cloud model theory this study proposed a water quality evaluation system using the measured data of groundwater in jilin city the oncm and mncm that consider seven evaluation parameters were established the critic objective weighting method was used to calculate the weight of each evaluation parameter while the lem was used to determine the groundwater quality level the evaluation results obtained via mcm lem were compared with those obtained via other evaluation methods with the relative advantages and disadvantages of the lem and mmdp analyzed the conclusions are as follows 1 the evaluation results obtained via the mcm lem model were largely consistent with those obtained via the other evaluation methods which demonstrated the reliability of the model in water quality evaluation 2 the mcm lem transforms the accurate water quality classification standard into a cloud composed of multiple cloud drops making the division of the water quality level fuzzy again with the fuzziness and randomness of the water quality classification characterized by the cloud parameters following this the measured concentration of the evaluation parameter is taken as the cloud drops in the cloud and the random membership degree of the evaluation parameter is generated via matlab software which not only realizes the combination of fuzziness and randomness but also avoids the complex function calculation process and improves the evaluation efficiency ensuring that the evaluation results are more scientific and objective furthermore the mncm considers multiple evaluation parameters which reduces the time for establishing the normal cloud model and calculating the membership without increasing the complexity of the model making the evaluation process more concise and clearer 3 using the lem to determine the water quality level overcomes the inapplicability of the traditional determination method mmdp and considers the contribution of all membership degrees ensuring that the evaluation results are more scientific and reasonable at the same time it can also assess the better one among different water samples with the same water quality level credit authorship contribution statement dongmei ruan conceptualization methodology software
