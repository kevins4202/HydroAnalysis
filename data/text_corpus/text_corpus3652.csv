18260,anaerobic digestion is sensitive to a wide variety of inhibitory substances that are the primary cause of anaerobic digester failure herein an anaerobic digestion ad tank which also functioned as the anodic chamber of an algae assisted microbial fuel cell amfc was established to treat food waste fw under an inhibition relieved condition about 2 9 l of ch4 was yielded by the ad amfc system which was more than double the ch4 produced by the ad system and 34 higher than that from the ad mfc system the result suggests that the bioelectrochemical system and algae successfully improved the ad performance and energy production the ad amfc system had the highest volatile fatty acid vfa concentration in the initial 20 days but it maintained the lowest vfa concentration in the following days those results indicate that the amfc shortened the acclimatisation phase of the ad process and then alleviated the adverse impact of vfas by consuming vfas as a substrate for electricity generation alkalinity generated by algal growth and cathode reactions buffered the h that migrated from the anolyte which facilitated the ph recovery of the ad process ammonia inhibition of the ad was also relieved by the amfc through reduction of the ammonia concentration to less than 500 mg l in the anolyte additionally the cod removal rate was improved to 89 since the amfc facilitated the decomposition of large molecules the present study developed a practical structure for an ad tank and also explained the reason as to why the amfc improved the ad performance graphical abstract image

reaches the market or is wasted by households generating significant environmental pollution and financial costs around the world springmann et al 2018 lin et al 2013 more than 90 million tonnes of fw are disposed of annually in china and the amount is expected to keep going up due to population growth and increasing urbanization zhang et al 2014 fw is characterized by having high moisture protein and fat contents and being perishable yun et al 2018 which cause the world s mounting fw disposal problem and create many issues in public life such as bad odour air pollution and leaching karmee 2016 the treatment and disposal of fw have posed very serious emerging environmental challenges globally fw is mainly generated from edible food that was intended for human consumption but has been discarded or lost grizzetti et al 2013 chemically fw contains a large proportion of high energy components such as lipids carbohydrates amino acids phosphates vitamins and other carbon containing substances pham et al 2015 in a circular economy where sustainable fw management is developed fw has great potential to be converted through a set of technologies into high value energy fuel and natural nutrients ingrao et al 2018 chaudhary et al 2018 anaerobic digestion as a well established process for converting organic waste into biogas has attracted extensive attention as a sustainable approach for waste treatment with a smaller required volume of digested sludge a low energy requirement and biogas energy recovery ren et al 2018 beckmann et al 2016 despite these benefits the potential for further optimization of anaerobic digestion in terms of energy recovery is still high owing to the low efficiency of organic matter removals and the accumulation of inhibitory substances within the reactor bennett et al 2018 chen et al 2008 microbial fuel cells mfcs assisted by algae have been proven to be advantageous due to their capability for waste treatment and energy harvesting especially in environmental applications li et al 2014 santoro et al 2012 mfcs can efficaciously remove various biodegradable organics like glucose starch vfas and proteins kumar et al 2018 moreover mfcs designed to incorporate microalgae provide a novel efficient and cost effective solution for increasing the concentration of oxygen at the cathode kakarla et al 2015 furthermore fw may provide cheap n p and other nutrient sources which have previously been successfully used for cultivating microalgae some microalgae with inherent advantageous qualities such as rapid biomass concentration and high lipid content have attracted significantly increased interest as potential biodiesel feedstocks especially as the world seeks to prevent future oil crises and climate change rasoul amini et al 2011 georgianna and mayfield 2012 many researchers have previously found functional relationships between mfcs and ad in the organic matter treatment processes but few studies elaborated the mechanisms by which the ad process was enhanced by mfcs eaktasang et al 2013 used mfcs to control malodorous hydrogen sulfide compounds generated from ad when treating domestic wastewaters single chamber mfcs were investigated as potential shock sensors for vfas in anaerobic digesters schievano et al 2018 herein an amfc as a more efficient bioelectrochemical system will enhance the ad process more substantially which will make it easier to reveal the interaction mechanisms and also promote the application of the amfc system to ad processes in this study an ad tank which also functioned as the anodic chamber of an amfc was established to treat the fw the improvement of the ad process and ch4 production in the ad amfc system is elaborated the reasons for the enhanced ad process in ad amfc were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor design operation and inoculation the plexiglas reactor working volume of 4 7 l consisted of an anodic chamber 15 cm 10 cm 15 cm working volume of 1 9 l and a cathodic chamber 15 cm 15 cm 15 cm working volume of 2 8 l the anodic chamber also functioned as the ad tank in this study screws and rubber gaskets were used to seal the reactors to avoid leakages fig 1 for the ad mfc and ad amfc systems the anodic and cathodic chambers were physically separated by a cation exchange membrane cem and for the ad system the anode and cathode chambers were separated by a rubber sheet for preventing ion exchange a 10 l gas bag was connected to each of the anode chamber through a gas collection pipe to collect the gas generated and the total volume of biogas was recorded every day the anode electrode was made of graphite 5 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length the cathode electrode was carbon cloth with an area of 100 cm2 before packing into the chambers the cem was pretreated by immersion in 3 h2so4 for 4 h at room temperature and then washed with deionized water the carbon cloth and electrode were pretreated by immersion in 1 mol l hcl and 1 mol l naoh for 24 h respectively after that they were washed with deionized water twice the carbon cloth and carbon electrode were connected by titanium wires and a fixed external resistance of 1000 ω was connected to the electrodes through copper wires fw was collected from a canteen in shandong university which included uneaten food and food preparation leftovers solid fw was collected and smashed in accordance with our previous study hou et al 2016a the characteristics of the fw were shown in table s1 anaerobic sludge obtained from shandong shifang environmental energy company after a process of anaerobic digestion was used as an inoculum anodic chamber were inoculated with 10 anaerobic sludge and 90 fw by volume while the cathodic chambers were loaded with diluted fw extract the diluted fw extract by a factor of 20 was also used as the culture medium for the growth of golenkinia sp sdec 16 in the cathodic chambers according to our previous study hou et al 2016b golenkinia sp sdec 16 had a great adaptability and characteristics for treating anaerobically digested effluent from kitchen waste and producing biofuel production in mfcs 2 2 experimental set up to investigate the effects of mfcs and algae on the ad process during fw treatment three types of experiment were performed i ad treatment process only ad ii ad treatment process enhanced by mfc with the oxygen supplied to the cathode by an aerator ad mfc iii ad treatment process enhanced by amfc inoculated with golenkinia sp sdec 16 in the cathodic chamber ad amfc the initial algal concentration was about 150 mg l which was suitable for algae producing o2 in the catholyte of ad amfc system yang et al 2019 the whole experiment was operated at room temperature 25 2 c a row of fluorescent lamps provided a continuous illumination of 100 μmol m s for algal growth the anodic chamber and cathodic chamber were stirred with continuous mixing of 300 rpm and 100 rpm respectively at the beginning of the ad all of the anodic chambers were purged with n2 for 1 h to maintain anaerobic conditions all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 3 chemical biomass and bio electrochemical analyses vfa contents were

process and bioenergy generation by amfc 3 1 1 increase in ch4 production during ad process due to amfc ad is an energy recovering technology in terms of performance and economic feasibility and is one of the most attractive technologies to produce sustainable energy from wastes beckmann et al 2016 biogas production is a function of the feedstock s organic content and biodegradability in ad as illustrated in fig 2 a biogas began to be produced in noticeable amounts on the 15th day in the reactors that had the assistance of a mfc or amfc but the unassisted ad system began to produce biogas 5 days later bioelectrochemical systems are capable of stabilizing and remediating ad systems inglesby and fisher 2012 which may shorten the time required for the acclimatisation stage for the ad amfc and ad mfc maciascorral et al 2008 suggested that most of the digestion of organic wastes was limited to the first 50 days of operation after which the gas production rate was drastically reduced in the present study the systems barely produced biogas after 40 days of operation and for ad amfc and ad mfc in total 4 7 l and 3 7 l of biogas were collected from the reactors respectively whilst fw treatment in the ad reactor alone showed a lower biogas production of 2 3 l thus biogas production was respectively improved by 104 and 62 in the ad amfc and ad mfc systems in comparison with ad operation previous studies indicated that ad reactors with bioelectrochemical systems possessed more even and diverse bacterial communities compared to the anaerobic control reactor chen et al 2019 which might improve the resistance to environmental stressors and stabilize ad rectors a total of 2 9 l of ch4 was obtained from the ad amfc which was more than double the amount of ch4 produced from ad alone and 34 higher than that from ad mfc fig 2b the proportions of methane in the biogas produced from ad and ad mfc were 53 2 and 58 4 respectively and the carbon dioxide proportions from the two systems were 39 5 and 29 7 respectively fig s1 a previous study reported that 57 ch4 was produced in biocatalyzed electrolysis combined with ad using acetate as feedstock clauwaert et al 2008 which was close to the proportions of ch4 produced by ad mfc after inoculating golenkinia sp into the cathodic chamber the ch4 fraction further increased to 61 3 whilst the percentage of carbon dioxide decreased to 15 3 a short acclimatisation phase of the ad amfc system may reduce co2 production since co2 accounted for a high proportion in this period vu and min 2019 besides the reducing ability of cathode and relatively low nitrogen content may benefit ch4 production and reduce co2 generation in the ad amfc system jain et al 2015 chen et al 2008 thus bioelectrochemical systems and algae play crucial roles in the promotion of methane production and reduction of co2 production during the ad process 3 1 2 enhanced ad process under high output voltage in the ad amfc and ad mfc systems anaerobic oxidative respiration of biodegradable substrates occurs at a biological anode to generate electricity coupled with the ad process schievano et al 2018 voltage outputs from the two reactors are shown in fig 2c the initial voltage for the ad amfc was about 270 mv and it reached 490 mv on the 25th day the voltage from the ad amfc stayed at a relatively high level of around 450 mv from the 10th to 30th day while a period with similar behaviour was observed in the ad mfc with a voltage less than 350 mv in the initial 25 days dissolved oxygen do in the catholyte functioned as the electron acceptor for the cathode reactions the mfc using an aeration device instead of algae for oxygen supply in the cathodic chamber showed less capability for electricity production algal photosynthesis provided higher do concentrations around 10 mg l than that generated by the aeration device about 8 5 mg l which may be one of explanations for the increased electricity generation in the ad amfc in previous research the output voltage from mfcs was used as a signal correlated to organic substances that influenced the anodic reactions schievano et al 2018 the output voltage also depends on the electrogenic activity of bacteria settling on the electrodes which can be used as a real time monitor of anaerobic microbial consortia chang et al 2005 in the present study voltage signals were positively related to the biogas production and organic substance removal rates imposing an external voltage has been a common method to upgrade methane generation in bioelectrochemical ad systems ding et al 2016 integration of amfcs with ad can also achieve such a bioelectrochemical system but does not require external power to sustain it 3 1 3 improved bioenergy generation by amfcs energy production from the ad amfc system consisted of three parts energy from methane energy from algal lipid and energy from electricity energy from algal lipid was only obtained from the system of ad amfc as illustrated in fig 2d algal biomass increased rapidly in the initial 25 days and then remained a stable value of about 0 8 g l lipid content of biomass was determined after the algae grew into stationary phase the result suggested that the lipid content did not change dramatically which ranged from 30 6 to 32 3 thus it was calculated that the energy obtained from the extracted algal lipid was about 10 2 kj from a preliminary estimation a total energy of 113 6 kj was obtained from the ad amfc system where energy from methane contributed to the majority of the energy produced fig 3 energy from algal lipid accounted for about 9 of the total energy produced while bioelectrochemical systems contribute to a small fraction 1 compared to the energy recovered in the form of methane electricity generation from mfcs is far from having a practical application owing to the low power density li et al 2014 in this study the bioelectrochemical system was not expected to be a high energy contributing unit but rather to improve the system stability and methane yields the energy produced from the ad system about 43 8 kj which came from methane production was less than half the amount of energy produced in the ad amfc as the result of the greater methane production in the latter system the energy recovered from the ad ad mfc and ad amfc was normalized with the total energy contained in the fw to obtain the energy efficiency the energy efficiency of ad was about 0 9 whilst for bioelectrochemically assisted ad was 1 6 and a higher efficiency of 2 3 was obtained in the ad amfc thus using the anodic chamber as an ad tank can successfully improve the bioenergy generation of the ad process system scaling up would be inevitable to make ad amfc suitable for real world applications the capital costs of a conventional mfc system reached 1 32 kwh kg fw due to the inherently complex design rozendal et al 2008 the revenue produced from the ad amfc system can not offset the higher capital cost under the circumstance though the system produced much more energy than that of the ad system table s2 in the ad amfc system the amfc was not expected to produce much electricity but rather to improve the system stability and methane yields thus the capital costs of the amfc can be reduced via simplifying designs and materials in real world application the capital costs might be further reduced with the development of innovative materials and mfc technologies besides the ad amfc has a particular benefit in pollutant removal compared with conventional ad systems it was notable that the organic removal rate of the fw was enhanced from 74 to 89 after integrating the ad with an amfc while nitrogen removal rate in the anolyte increased dramatically from 34 to 82 overall the amfc holds a great potential to promote the ad performance in future application 3 2 alleviating environmental stresses by incorporating amfcs 3 2 1 alleviating stresses due to volatile fatty acid vfa consumption vfas products of organic matter hydrolysis have been recognized as important intermediates during the ad process li and ju 2018 vfa accumulation as a result of high organic load not only inhibits activities of methanogens but also leads to a drop in ph rajagopal et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 vfa concentrations in all reactors increased to the same level of about 610 mg l on the 10th day the vfa concentration then increased rapidly to 5000 mg l in the ad amfc system on the 20th day it has been demonstrated that vfas can be used for a rapid monitoring in the ad process jin et al 2017 vrieze et al 2018 therefore the increase of vfas in ad amfc implied that the bioelectrochemical and algal system accelerated the ad process and shortened the acclimatisation phase the accumulation of vfas is mainly caused by the high organic load resulting in the destruction of the dynamic balance of anaerobic digestion jia et al 2018 accumulation of vfas leads to a detrimental acidic condition that may limit the ad process as illustrated in fig 5 a the lowest ph of about 4 8 was observed on the 20th day in the ad amfc system temudo et al 2007 reported that butyric acid was the most common product during the fermentation process at low ph which was consistent with the results in the present study butyric acid was also suggested as a pronounced indicator of process imbalance and excessive butyrate may lead to low proportion of ch4 in the biogas produced vu and min 2019 the highest butyric acid concentration in the ad system was up to 4600 mg l which maybe one of the explanations for the lowest ch4 output being obtained from the ad system fig s1 the concentrations of acetic acid increased rapidly to 1420 mg l in the ad amfc on the 20th day while acetic acid concentration in ad operation still maintained a low value of around 250 mg l these results indicate that a well balanced ad process where the hydrolysis phase proceeded towards acetogenesis was facilitated by the amfc the ad system obtained a total vfa concentration of 8300 mg l on the 30th day and it maintained the highest level of vfas among the three systems in the following days in contrast the vfa concentrations in the ad amfc dropped to low values after the 20th day mfcs are particularly suitable for treating low strength soluble organics such as vfas li et al 2013 which may have contributed to the low vfa concentrations in the ad amfc in the later phase of the experiment it was reported that 2000 mg l of vfas led to inhibition of cellulose degradation while vfa concentrations above 4000 mg l caused weak inhibition of glucose wang et al 2009a therefore the ad system may be inhibited by vfas since the concentrations were more than 6000 mg l after the 30th day acetate can be directly consumed for electricity generation but long chained vfas such as butyrate and valerate must first be converted into acetate by the mfc choi et al 2011 that may be one of the explanations for the greatest accumulation and consumption of acetate occurring in the reactor of ad amfc vfa consumption by the amfc relieved the inhibition of methanogens and also facilitated ph recovery to a neutral condition which benefited ch4 production in this system in addition acetate accumulation may also improve ch4 generation in this system since ch4 was mainly produced by acetotrophic methanogens with acetate being consumed wang et al 2009a 3 2 2 facilitating ph recovery due to h migration to cathodic chamber h migration from the anodic chamber to the cathodic chamber through the cem may also alleviate the low ph condition during the ad process h as cations would migrate to the cathodic chamber to satisfy charge neutrality when current is generated logan et al 2006 this may be one of the reasons as to why low ph values were observed in the cathodic chamber in the first 20 days fig s2 algal growth is a process with alkalinity generation that can buffer the low ph of the catholyte caused by h migration in addition o2 served as the electron acceptor for the cathode reaction with the consumption of h logan et al 2006 thus the ph of the catholyte rose rapidly to over 9 0 after the acidification phase of the ad process fig s2 the alkaline catholyte aided the ph recovery of the anolyte and improved the system stabilization as well as methane production 3 2 3 alleviating ammonia inhibition due to nh4 migration to cathodic chamber high ammonia concentrations may inhibit methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion though nitrogen is an essential nutrient for bacterial growth yenigun and demirel 2013 several mechanisms for ammonia inhibition have been proposed such as changes in the intracellular ph proton imbalance within cells and inhibition of a specific enzyme reaction chen et al 2008 as illustrated in fig 5b the nh4 n concentration in the anolyte of the ad amfc dropped to less than 500 mg l in the initial 20 days whilst there was still more than 1700 mg l nh4 n remaining in the ad system nh4 as cations would migrate to the catholyte through the cem to reduce the concentration difference and maintain a charge balance between the two chambers haddadi et al 2013 especially for the ad amfc system which yielded a higher current the increasing nh4 n concentration in the catholyte of the ad mfc and the ad amfc confirmed that nh4 migration occurred in both of the bioelectrochemical systems fig s2 ammonia losses in the catholyte enhanced nh4 migration since it boosted the concentration difference between the two chambers ammonia oxidation and volatilization are two pathways that led to the ammonium losses in the catholyte more importantly algae are capable of accumulating ammonia at a relatively fast rate which may result in a lower ammonia concentration in the catholyte of the ad amfc besides nh4 migration simultaneous nitrification and denitrification also contributed to the low ammonia concentration in the anolyte of the ad amfc according to the high n2 volume produced by this system fig 1b huang et al 2018 proved the coexistence of denitrifying bacteria and exoelectrogenic bacteria in the mfcs which may explained the n2 production in the present study oxygen migration from the catholyte may have oxidized some ammonia to nitrite or nitrate and then the nitrite or nitrate was reduced to n2 as electron acceptors it is notable that the proportion of nitrogen increased from 7 29 to 17 91 and 23 42 when enhanced by the mfc and amfc respectively fig s1 these results implied that the bioelectrochemical reactions may benefit denitrification in the ad process 3 3 enhanced organic matter removal by bioelectrochemical systems and algae the cod removal rate in the ad process was about 74 and this increased to 89 after the amfc was included in the system the cod concentration in the catholyte of ad mfc and ad amfc reduced from 1800 mg l to about 1400 mg l and 800 mg l respectively to further analyse organic matter removal in the anodic chamber eem fluorescence spectroscopy was conducted four peaks a b c and d were observed in the eem fluorescence spectroscopy and all of the spectra corresponding to the presence of different fluorophores are characterized by their excitation emission ex em wavelength pairs peak a 270 280 295 310 nm and peak c 220 230 295 305 nm were tyrosine like compounds peak b 270 285 340 355 indicated soluble microbial byproduct like substances peak d at approximately 225 350 nm was attributed to tryptophan like substances chen et al 2003 guo et al 2010 high fluorescence intensities were observed in the a b and c regions for the sample of fw without treatment suggesting that initially the fw contained a high concentration of organic matter as shown in fig 6 b there were still lots of substances remaining in the ad system without mfc enhancement with the assistance of bioelectrochemical treatment almost all of the soluble microbial byproduct like substances peak b and tryptophan like substances peak d were removed in the ad mfc and the ad amfc fig 6c and d yu et al 2018 suggested that microbial byproduct like substances were removed via the hydrolytic action of bioelectrogenesis during bioelectrochemically assisted anaerobic composting of dewatered sludge the blue shifts at peak a and peak c indicated that the organics with large molecular masses were likely decomposed into small molecular organics through diverse metabolism processes wang et al 2009b ma et al 2018 suggested that some macromolecular substances which cannot be oxidized and reduced by ad process can be broken down into small molecular substances with assistance of mfcs furthermore the intensities of the peak c for tyrosine like substances were significantly decreased with the assistance of an amfc a similar conclusion was reported by li et al 2016 who found that tyrosine like substances were distinctly reduced after mfc treatment these results indicated that the amfc improved the removal of soluble microbial byproduct like substances and tryptophan like substances during the ad process and it also facilitated the decomposition of large molecules 3 4 potential applications of the residual fw after treated in the systems the residual fw still contained high amounts of nutrients and organics the vast amount of effluent may create concerns of environment pollution or economic issues if additional treatment is required thankfully there are many studies investigated the application of such residues coming from anaerobic digestion the residual fw is suitable for land application as a valuable fertilizer and soil amelioration because of the high nutrient content n p k in available form lu et al 2015 tambone et al 2010 additionally the residual fw can be pyrolyzed into biochar which is generally desirable for contaminant remediation or wastewater treatment inyang et al 2010 the residual fw effluent is also a potential medium for microalgae cultivation since it contains abundant nutrients cai et al 2013 cultivating algae in the diluted effluent can produce desired biomass and considerable algal lipid content zhang et al 2018 thus after reducing the mass of the fw and minimising its environmental impact in the prototypical system many practical strategies can be applied to utilize the residual fw 4 conclusion an ad tank which also functioned as the anodic chamber of an amfc was established to enhance the ad of fw this study indicated that the system successfully improved bioenergy generation in the ad process through improving methane yields the volume of methane obtained from the ad amfc was about 2 9 l which was more than double the amount of methane produced from ad alone additionally energy from algal lipid and electricity contributed to about 10 of the total energy obtained from the ad amfc system amfc are capable of shortening the acclimatisation phase and relieving the adverse impact on the ad process three pathways for stress alleviation may occur in the ad amfc system i alleviating the adverse impact of vfas by consuming them as substrates of amfc ii alkalinity generated in the catholyte facilitated ph recovery during the ad process iii ammonia inhabitation was relieved due to ammonium migration and algal accumulation besides that the amfc improved the removal of soluble microbial byproduct like substances and tryptophan like substances and it also facilitated the decomposition of large molecules the novel system presents opportunities for stabilizing and enhancing the ad process in the treatment of high strength wastes with high ammonium concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18260,anaerobic digestion is sensitive to a wide variety of inhibitory substances that are the primary cause of anaerobic digester failure herein an anaerobic digestion ad tank which also functioned as the anodic chamber of an algae assisted microbial fuel cell amfc was established to treat food waste fw under an inhibition relieved condition about 2 9 l of ch4 was yielded by the ad amfc system which was more than double the ch4 produced by the ad system and 34 higher than that from the ad mfc system the result suggests that the bioelectrochemical system and algae successfully improved the ad performance and energy production the ad amfc system had the highest volatile fatty acid vfa concentration in the initial 20 days but it maintained the lowest vfa concentration in the following days those results indicate that the amfc shortened the acclimatisation phase of the ad process and then alleviated the adverse impact of vfas by consuming vfas as a substrate for electricity generation alkalinity generated by algal growth and cathode reactions buffered the h that migrated from the anolyte which facilitated the ph recovery of the ad process ammonia inhibition of the ad was also relieved by the amfc through reduction of the ammonia concentration to less than 500 mg l in the anolyte additionally the cod removal rate was improved to 89 since the amfc facilitated the decomposition of large molecules the present study developed a practical structure for an ad tank and also explained the reason as to why the amfc improved the ad performance graphical abstract image

natural nutrients ingrao et al 2018 chaudhary et al 2018 anaerobic digestion as a well established process for converting organic waste into biogas has attracted extensive attention as a sustainable approach for waste treatment with a smaller required volume of digested sludge a low energy requirement and biogas energy recovery ren et al 2018 beckmann et al 2016 despite these benefits the potential for further optimization of anaerobic digestion in terms of energy recovery is still high owing to the low efficiency of organic matter removals and the accumulation of inhibitory substances

mechanisms by which the ad process was enhanced by mfcs eaktasang et al 2013 used mfcs to control malodorous hydrogen sulfide compounds generated from ad when treating domestic wastewaters single chamber mfcs were investigated as potential shock sensors for vfas in anaerobic digesters schievano et al 2018 herein an amfc as a more efficient bioelectrochemical system will enhance the ad process more substantially which will make it easier to reveal the interaction mechanisms and also promote the application of the amfc system to ad processes in this study an ad tank which also functioned as the anodic chamber of an amfc was established to treat the fw the improvement of the ad process and ch4 production in the ad amfc system is elaborated the reasons for the enhanced ad process in ad amfc were analyzed 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor design operation and inoculation the plexiglas reactor working volume of 4 7 l consisted of an anodic chamber 15 cm 10 cm 15 cm working volume of 1 9 l and a cathodic chamber 15 cm 15 cm 15 cm working volume of 2 8 l the anodic chamber also functioned as the ad tank in this study screws and rubber gaskets were used to seal the reactors to avoid leakages fig 1 for the ad mfc and ad amfc systems the anodic and cathodic chambers were physically separated by a cation exchange membrane cem and for the ad system the anode and cathode chambers were separated by a rubber sheet for preventing ion exchange a 10 l gas bag was connected to each of the anode chamber through a gas collection pipe to collect the gas generated and the total volume of biogas was recorded every day the anode electrode was made of graphite 5 mm in diameter and 60 mm in length the cathode electrode was carbon cloth with an area of 100 cm2 before packing into the chambers the cem was pretreated by immersion in 3 h2so4 for 4 h at room temperature and then washed with deionized water the carbon cloth and electrode were pretreated by immersion in 1 mol l hcl and 1 mol l naoh for 24 h respectively after that they were washed with deionized water twice the carbon cloth and carbon electrode were connected by titanium wires and a fixed external resistance of 1000 ω was connected to the electrodes through copper wires fw was collected from a canteen in shandong university which included uneaten food and food preparation leftovers solid fw was collected and smashed in accordance with our previous study hou et al 2016a the characteristics of the fw were shown in table s1 anaerobic sludge obtained from shandong shifang environmental energy company after a process of anaerobic digestion was used as an inoculum anodic chamber were inoculated with 10 anaerobic sludge and 90 fw by volume while the cathodic chambers were loaded with diluted fw extract the diluted fw extract by a factor of 20 was also used as the culture medium for the growth of golenkinia sp sdec 16 in the cathodic chambers according to our previous study hou et al 2016b golenkinia sp sdec 16 had a great adaptability and characteristics for treating anaerobically digested effluent from kitchen waste and producing biofuel production in mfcs 2 2 experimental set up to investigate the effects of mfcs and algae on the ad process during fw treatment three types of experiment were performed i ad treatment process only ad ii ad treatment process enhanced by mfc with the oxygen supplied to the cathode by an aerator ad mfc iii ad treatment process enhanced by amfc inoculated with golenkinia sp sdec 16 in the cathodic chamber ad amfc the initial algal concentration was about 150 mg l which was suitable for algae producing o2 in the catholyte of ad amfc system yang et al 2019 the whole experiment was operated at room temperature 25 2 c a row of fluorescent lamps provided a continuous illumination of 100 μmol m s for algal growth the anodic chamber and cathodic chamber were stirred with continuous mixing of 300 rpm and 100 rpm respectively at the beginning of the ad all of the anodic chambers were purged with n2 for 1 h to maintain anaerobic conditions all experiments were performed in triplicate 2 3 chemical biomass and bio electrochemical analyses vfa contents were

process and bioenergy generation by amfc 3 1 1 increase in ch4 production during ad process due to amfc ad is an energy recovering technology in terms of performance and economic feasibility and is one of the most attractive technologies to produce sustainable energy from wastes beckmann et al 2016 biogas production is a function of the feedstock s organic content and biodegradability in ad as illustrated in fig 2 a biogas began to be produced in noticeable amounts on the 15th day in the reactors that had the assistance of a mfc or amfc but the unassisted ad system began to produce biogas 5 days later bioelectrochemical systems are capable of stabilizing and remediating ad systems inglesby and fisher 2012 which may shorten the time required for the acclimatisation stage for the ad amfc and ad mfc maciascorral et al 2008 suggested that most of the digestion of organic wastes was limited to the first 50 days of operation after which the gas production rate was drastically reduced in the present study the systems barely produced biogas after 40 days of operation and for ad amfc and ad mfc in total 4 7 l and 3 7 l of biogas were collected from the reactors respectively whilst fw treatment in the ad reactor alone showed a lower biogas production of 2 3 l thus biogas production was respectively improved by 104 and 62 in the ad amfc and ad mfc systems in comparison with ad operation previous studies indicated that ad reactors with bioelectrochemical systems possessed more even and diverse bacterial communities compared to the anaerobic control reactor chen et al 2019 which might improve the resistance to environmental stressors and stabilize ad rectors a total of 2 9 l of ch4 was obtained from the ad amfc which was more than double the amount of ch4 produced from ad alone and 34 higher than that from ad mfc fig 2b the proportions of methane in the biogas produced from ad and ad mfc were 53 2 and 58 4 respectively and the carbon dioxide proportions from the two systems were 39 5 and 29 7 respectively fig s1 a previous study reported that 57 ch4 was produced in biocatalyzed electrolysis combined with ad using acetate as feedstock clauwaert et al 2008 which was close to the proportions of ch4 produced by ad mfc after inoculating golenkinia sp into the cathodic chamber the ch4 fraction further increased to 61 3 whilst the percentage of carbon dioxide decreased to 15 3 a short acclimatisation phase of the ad amfc system may reduce co2 production since co2 accounted for a high proportion in this period vu and min 2019 besides the reducing ability of cathode and relatively low nitrogen content may benefit ch4 production and reduce co2 generation in the ad amfc system jain et al 2015 chen et al 2008 thus bioelectrochemical systems and algae play crucial roles in the promotion of methane production and reduction of co2 production during the ad process 3 1 2 enhanced ad process under high output voltage in the ad amfc and ad mfc systems anaerobic oxidative respiration of biodegradable substrates occurs at a biological anode to generate electricity coupled with the ad process schievano et al 2018 voltage outputs from the two reactors are shown in fig 2c the initial voltage for the ad amfc was about 270 mv and it reached 490 mv on the 25th day the voltage from the ad amfc stayed at a relatively high level of around 450 mv from the 10th to 30th day while a period with similar behaviour was observed in the ad mfc with a voltage less than 350 mv in the initial 25 days dissolved oxygen do in the catholyte functioned as the electron acceptor for the cathode reactions the mfc using an aeration device instead of algae for oxygen supply in the cathodic chamber showed less capability for electricity production algal photosynthesis provided higher do concentrations around 10 mg l than that generated by the aeration device about 8 5 mg l which may be one of explanations for the increased electricity generation in the ad amfc in previous research the output voltage from mfcs was used as a signal correlated to organic substances that influenced the anodic reactions schievano et al 2018 the output voltage also depends on the electrogenic activity of bacteria settling on the electrodes which can be used as a real time monitor of anaerobic microbial consortia chang et al 2005 in the present study voltage signals were positively related to the biogas production and organic substance removal rates imposing an external voltage has been a common method to upgrade methane generation in bioelectrochemical ad systems ding et al 2016 integration of amfcs with ad can also achieve such a bioelectrochemical system but does not require external power to sustain it 3 1 3 improved bioenergy generation by amfcs energy production from the ad amfc system consisted of three parts energy from methane energy from algal lipid and energy from electricity energy from algal lipid was only obtained from the system of ad amfc as illustrated in fig 2d algal biomass increased rapidly in the initial 25 days and then remained a stable value of about 0 8 g l lipid content of biomass was determined after the algae grew into stationary phase the result suggested that the lipid content did not change dramatically which ranged from 30 6 to 32 3 thus it was calculated that the energy obtained from the extracted algal lipid was about 10 2 kj from a preliminary estimation a total energy of 113 6 kj was obtained from the ad amfc system where energy from methane contributed to the majority of the energy produced fig 3 energy from algal lipid accounted for about 9 of the total energy produced while bioelectrochemical systems contribute to a small fraction 1 compared to the energy recovered in the form of methane electricity generation from mfcs is far from having a practical application owing to the low power density li et al 2014 in this study the bioelectrochemical system was not expected to be a high energy contributing unit but rather to improve the system stability and methane yields the energy produced from the ad system about 43 8 kj which came from methane production was less than half the amount of energy produced in the ad amfc as the result of the greater methane production in the latter system the energy recovered from the ad ad mfc and ad amfc was normalized with the total energy contained in the fw to obtain the energy efficiency the energy efficiency of ad was about 0 9 whilst for bioelectrochemically assisted ad was 1 6 and a higher efficiency of 2 3 was obtained in the ad amfc thus using the anodic chamber as an ad tank can successfully improve the bioenergy generation of the ad process system scaling up would be inevitable to make ad amfc suitable for real world applications the capital costs of a conventional mfc system reached 1 32 kwh kg fw due to the inherently complex design rozendal et al 2008 the revenue produced from the ad amfc system can not offset the higher capital cost under the circumstance though the system produced much more energy than that of the ad system table s2 in the ad amfc system the amfc was not expected to produce much electricity but rather to improve the system stability and methane yields thus the capital costs of the amfc can be reduced via simplifying designs and materials in real world application the capital costs might be further reduced with the development of innovative materials and mfc technologies besides the ad amfc has a particular benefit in pollutant removal compared with conventional ad systems it was notable that the organic removal rate of the fw was enhanced from 74 to 89 after integrating the ad with an amfc while nitrogen removal rate in the anolyte increased dramatically from 34 to 82 overall the amfc holds a great potential to promote the ad performance in future application 3 2 alleviating environmental stresses by incorporating amfcs 3 2 1 alleviating stresses due to volatile fatty acid vfa consumption vfas products of organic matter hydrolysis have been recognized as important intermediates during the ad process li and ju 2018 vfa accumulation as a result of high organic load not only inhibits activities of methanogens but also leads to a drop in ph rajagopal et al 2013 as shown in fig 4 vfa concentrations in all reactors increased to the same level of about 610 mg l on the 10th day the vfa concentration then increased rapidly to 5000 mg l in the ad amfc system on the 20th day it has been demonstrated that vfas can be used for a rapid monitoring in the ad process jin et al 2017 vrieze et al 2018 therefore the increase of vfas in ad amfc implied that the bioelectrochemical and algal system accelerated the ad process and shortened the acclimatisation phase the accumulation of vfas is mainly caused by the high organic load resulting in the destruction of the dynamic balance of anaerobic digestion jia et al 2018 accumulation of vfas leads to a detrimental acidic condition that may limit the ad process as illustrated in fig 5 a the lowest ph of about 4 8 was observed on the 20th day in the ad amfc system temudo et al 2007 reported that butyric acid was the most common product during the fermentation process at low ph which was consistent with the results in the present study butyric acid was also suggested as a pronounced indicator of process imbalance and excessive butyrate may lead to low proportion of ch4 in the biogas produced vu and min 2019 the highest butyric acid concentration in the ad system was up to 4600 mg l which maybe one of the explanations for the lowest ch4 output being obtained from the ad system fig s1 the concentrations of acetic acid increased rapidly to 1420 mg l in the ad amfc on the 20th day while acetic acid concentration in ad operation still maintained a low value of around 250 mg l these results indicate that a well balanced ad process where the hydrolysis phase proceeded towards acetogenesis was facilitated by the amfc the ad system obtained a total vfa concentration of 8300 mg l on the 30th day and it maintained the highest level of vfas among the three systems in the following days in contrast the vfa concentrations in the ad amfc dropped to low values after the 20th day mfcs are particularly suitable for treating low strength soluble organics such as vfas li et al 2013 which may have contributed to the low vfa concentrations in the ad amfc in the later phase of the experiment it was reported that 2000 mg l of vfas led to inhibition of cellulose degradation while vfa concentrations above 4000 mg l caused weak inhibition of glucose wang et al 2009a therefore the ad system may be inhibited by vfas since the concentrations were more than 6000 mg l after the 30th day acetate can be directly consumed for electricity generation but long chained vfas such as butyrate and valerate must first be converted into acetate by the mfc choi et al 2011 that may be one of the explanations for the greatest accumulation and consumption of acetate occurring in the reactor of ad amfc vfa consumption by the amfc relieved the inhibition of methanogens and also facilitated ph recovery to a neutral condition which benefited ch4 production in this system in addition acetate accumulation may also improve ch4 generation in this system since ch4 was mainly produced by acetotrophic methanogens with acetate being consumed wang et al 2009a 3 2 2 facilitating ph recovery due to h migration to cathodic chamber h migration from the anodic chamber to the cathodic chamber through the cem may also alleviate the low ph condition during the ad process h as cations would migrate to the cathodic chamber to satisfy charge neutrality when current is generated logan et al 2006 this may be one of the reasons as to why low ph values were observed in the cathodic chamber in the first 20 days fig s2 algal growth is a process with alkalinity generation that can buffer the low ph of the catholyte caused by h migration in addition o2 served as the electron acceptor for the cathode reaction with the consumption of h logan et al 2006 thus the ph of the catholyte rose rapidly to over 9 0 after the acidification phase of the ad process fig s2 the alkaline catholyte aided the ph recovery of the anolyte and improved the system stabilization as well as methane production 3 2 3 alleviating ammonia inhibition due to nh4 migration to cathodic chamber high ammonia concentrations may inhibit methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion though nitrogen is an essential nutrient for bacterial growth yenigun and demirel 2013 several mechanisms for ammonia inhibition have been proposed such as changes in the intracellular ph proton imbalance within cells and inhibition of a specific enzyme reaction chen et al 2008 as illustrated in fig 5b the nh4 n concentration in the anolyte of the ad amfc dropped to less than 500 mg l in the initial 20 days whilst there was still more than 1700 mg l nh4 n remaining in the ad system nh4 as cations would migrate to the catholyte through the cem to reduce the concentration difference and maintain a charge balance between the two chambers haddadi et al 2013 especially for the ad amfc system which yielded a higher current the increasing nh4 n concentration in the catholyte of the ad mfc and the ad amfc confirmed that nh4 migration occurred in both of the bioelectrochemical systems fig s2 ammonia losses in the catholyte enhanced nh4 migration since it boosted the concentration difference between the two chambers ammonia oxidation and volatilization are two pathways that led to the ammonium losses in the catholyte more importantly algae are capable of accumulating ammonia at a relatively fast rate which may result in a lower ammonia concentration in the catholyte of the ad amfc besides nh4 migration simultaneous nitrification and denitrification also contributed to the low ammonia concentration in the anolyte of the ad amfc according to the high n2 volume produced by this system fig 1b huang et al 2018 proved the coexistence of denitrifying bacteria and exoelectrogenic bacteria in the mfcs which may explained the n2 production in the present study oxygen migration from the catholyte may have oxidized some ammonia to nitrite or nitrate and then the nitrite or nitrate was reduced to n2 as electron acceptors it is notable that the proportion of nitrogen increased from 7 29 to 17 91 and 23 42 when enhanced by the mfc and amfc respectively fig s1 these results implied that the bioelectrochemical reactions may benefit denitrification in the ad process 3 3 enhanced organic matter removal by bioelectrochemical systems and algae the cod removal rate in the ad process was about 74 and this increased to 89 after the amfc was included in the system the cod concentration in the catholyte of ad mfc and ad amfc reduced from 1800 mg l to about 1400 mg l and 800 mg l respectively to further analyse organic matter removal in the anodic chamber eem fluorescence spectroscopy was conducted four peaks a b c and d were observed in the eem fluorescence spectroscopy and all of the spectra corresponding to the presence of different fluorophores are characterized by their excitation emission ex em wavelength pairs peak a 270 280 295 310 nm and peak c 220 230 295 305 nm were tyrosine like compounds peak b 270 285 340 355 indicated soluble microbial byproduct like substances peak d at approximately 225 350 nm was attributed to tryptophan like substances chen et al 2003 guo et al 2010 high fluorescence intensities were observed in the a b and c regions for the sample of fw without treatment suggesting that initially the fw contained a high concentration of organic matter as shown in fig 6 b there were still lots of substances remaining in the ad system without mfc enhancement with the assistance of bioelectrochemical treatment almost all of the soluble microbial byproduct like substances peak b and tryptophan like substances peak d were removed in the ad mfc and the ad amfc fig 6c and d yu et al 2018 suggested that microbial byproduct like substances were removed via the hydrolytic action of bioelectrogenesis during bioelectrochemically assisted anaerobic composting of dewatered sludge the blue shifts at peak a and peak c indicated that the organics with large molecular masses were likely decomposed into small molecular organics through diverse metabolism processes wang et al 2009b ma et al 2018 suggested that some macromolecular substances which cannot be oxidized and reduced by ad process can be broken down into small molecular substances with assistance of mfcs furthermore the intensities of the peak c for tyrosine like substances were significantly decreased with the assistance of an amfc a similar conclusion was reported by li et al 2016 who found that tyrosine like substances were distinctly reduced after mfc treatment these results indicated that the amfc improved the removal of soluble microbial byproduct like substances and tryptophan like substances during the ad process and it also facilitated the decomposition of large molecules 3 4 potential applications of the residual fw after treated in the systems the residual fw still contained high amounts of nutrients and organics the vast amount of effluent may create concerns of environment pollution or economic issues if additional treatment is required thankfully there are many studies investigated the application of such residues coming from anaerobic digestion the residual fw is suitable for land application as a valuable fertilizer and soil amelioration because of the high nutrient content n p k in available form lu et al 2015 tambone et al 2010 additionally the residual fw can be pyrolyzed into biochar which is generally desirable for contaminant remediation or wastewater treatment inyang et al 2010 the residual fw effluent is also a potential medium for microalgae cultivation since it contains abundant nutrients cai et al 2013 cultivating algae in the diluted effluent can produce desired biomass and considerable algal lipid content zhang et al 2018 thus after reducing the mass of the fw and minimising its environmental impact in the prototypical system many practical strategies can be applied to utilize the residual fw 4 conclusion an ad tank which also functioned as the anodic chamber of an amfc was established to enhance the ad of fw this study indicated that the system successfully improved bioenergy generation in the ad process through improving methane yields the volume of methane obtained from the ad amfc was about 2 9 l which was more than double the amount of methane produced from ad alone additionally energy from algal lipid and electricity contributed to about 10 of the total energy obtained from the ad amfc system amfc are capable of shortening the acclimatisation phase and relieving the adverse impact on the ad process three pathways for stress alleviation may occur in the ad amfc system i alleviating the adverse impact of vfas by consuming them as substrates of amfc ii alkalinity generated in the catholyte facilitated ph recovery during the ad process iii ammonia inhabitation was relieved due to ammonium migration and algal accumulation besides that the amfc improved the removal of soluble microbial byproduct like substances and tryptophan like substances and it also facilitated the decomposition of large molecules the novel system presents opportunities for stabilizing and enhancing the ad process in the treatment of high strength wastes with high ammonium concentrations declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18261,aeration and mechanical agitation are the main drivers of aerosol generation in wastewater treatment plants wwtps however the effect of aeration mode on aerosol characteristics remains poorly understood in this study horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration in the same wwtp were selected to identify the effect on the emission size distribution microbial and chemical composition for bacteria fungi enterobacteriaceae staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in aerosols the horizontal rotor aeration had higher contributions to the emissions than the fine bubble aeration horizontal rotor aeration generated a more coarse fraction size 7 μm and a comparable respirable fraction rf size 3 3 μm compared with those of fine bubble aeration more types of potential pathogens were generated by horizontal rotor aeration the most easily aerosolized genera generated by horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration were trichosporon and mycobacterium with the

wastewater treatment plant horizontal rotor aeration fine bubble aeration aerosols characteristics 1 introduction aerosols originating from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been confirmed to contain some hazardous components such as pathogenic bacteria korzeniewska et al 2009 uhrbrand et al 2017 fungi kowalski et al 2017 viruses masclaux et al 2014 uhrbrand et al 2017 and chemicals gangamma et al 2011 han et al 2018 these hazardous components have the potential to infect humans particularly workers at wwtps through inhalation dermal contact and ingestion sánchez monedero et al 2008 stellacci et al 2010 an illness among workers at wwtps termed sewage worker s syndrome has been reported rylander et al 1976 thus aerosol characteristics and risk assessment from wwtps have attracted increasingly more attention the main aerosol emission sources are the biological treatment unit and sludge dewatering room and aeration and mechanical agitation play an important role in aerosol generation in wwtps kowalski et al 2017 sánchez monedero et al 2008 yang et al 2019 studies regarding the effect of aeration systems on the levels of culturable airborne microorganisms have been widely conducted brandi et al 2000 found that mechanical aeration generates more aerosol bacteria and fungi than fine bubble diffusion compared from the perspective of different wwtps similar results of culturable airborne bacteria were also reported by sánchez monedero et al 2008 fernando and fedorak 2005 discovered a prominent decrease in airborne microorganism concentrations because of a change in the aeration system from coarse to fine bubble aeration during the process of biological nutrient removal apart from airborne microorganism concentrations size distribution and microbial population are also typical characteristics of aerosols related to human health uhrbrand et al 2017 wang et al 2018a xu et al 2018 it has been well known that aerosol particle size is closely related to particle deposition in the human respiratory tract pastuszka et al 2000 for example particles with diameters of 5 10 μm can adhere to the surface of the upper airway and cause disease such as rhinitis particles 5 μm diameter are strongly accompanied by a gas stream and can easily reach the alveoli nel 2005 nel et al 2006 airborne particulates with an aerodynamic diameter of 3 3 μm have been stipulated as the respirable fraction rf uhrbrand et al 2017 even worse specific pathogens associated with smaller size airborne particulates may increase these risks katsivela et al 2017 there is limited knowledge regarding the effect of aeration mode on the microbial population and size distribution particularly pathogens of aerosols from wwtps in addition the current analysis of hazardous components in aerosols have mainly focused on potential pathogens uhrbrand et al 2017 yang et al 2019 and very few of that have focused on hazardous chemicals some toxic metal loid s such as co cr ni and cd have been detected in atmospheric aerosols charlesworth et al 2011 wu et al 2007 stationary diesel engine exhaust betha and balasubramanian 2011 street dust zheng et al 2010 and mining infrastructure kim et al 2002 these toxic metal loid s in aerosols have been proven to be harmful to human health fang et al 2010 okuda et al 2008 wei and yang 2010 however the toxic metal loid s in wwtp aerosols and the effect of aeration mode on their characteristics have not been extensively studied therefore a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the effect of aeration mode on aerosol characteristics is quite necessary some studies have shown that aerosol composition is closely related to wastewater and sludge properties wang et al 2018b yang et al 2019 when a wastewater or sludge property changes the aerosol composition may be significantly different han et al 2018 yang et al 2019 comparing the effect of aeration mode on aerosol characteristics in different wwtps may be disturbed by water quality and sludge properties based on the aforementioned problems this work was conducted at a practical wwtp including an oxidation ditch od process with horizontal rotor aeration

respectively analyzed via field sampling particular attention was also paid to pathogens and toxic metal loid s the similarities of bacteria fungi and chemicals in aerosols from two aeration modes to wastewater were investigated the contributions of the two aeration modes to the emissions of microorganism and chemicals in aerosols were studied the influence of aeration mode on aerosol

analyzed samples and the results were amended via subtraction of the filter blanks 2 5 contribution of aeration mode to the aerosol emissions from wastewater for the culturable microorganisms and chemicals in aerosols the background in terms of uw concentrations were deducted from the results measured at the oxt and oda and the ratios were defined as the concentration in the aerosols to that in the wastewater which were used to evaluate the contributions of different aeration modes to emission levels in addition for microbial populations the aerosolization potential of certain taxa in aerosols from different aeration modes was assessed using the aerosolization factor af based on eq 1 michaud et al 2018 where if the af is higher than 1 then the microorganism is easy to aerosolize or is air enriched in contrast if the af is less than 1 then this microorganism is not easy to become aerosolized into the air from the wastewater 1 a f r e l a t i v e a b u n d a n c e w w t p a e r o

square root transformation and the ratios of the chemical concentrations to tsps which were log10 x 1 transformed were used for multivariate statistical analysis heatmaps were utilized to indicate the bacterial and fungal genera that were most frequently found in the different environments the similarities of the chemical compositions and bacterial and fungal populations in aerosols to wastewater were illustrated using non metric multidimensional scaling ordination nmds linking to cluster overlays and dendrogram analysis of similarity anosim test and similarity percentage simper analysis heatmap nmds anosim and simper analyses were conducted using primer version 7 0 clarke and gorley 2015 3 results 3 1 emission levels and size distributions of airborne microorganisms fig 2 illustrated the concentrations of culturable airborne microorganisms associated with size segregated airborne particulate matter the total concentration of bacteria and fungi fig 2a and b in oda aerosols was as high as 4249 and 2296 cfu m3 more than twice that 1941 and 1051 cfu m3 in oxt aerosols this result of bacteria was similar to that of a previous study sánchez monedero et al 2008 enterobacteriaceae staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa fig 2c e in the oda aerosols had a total concentration of 972 403 and 53 cfu m3 and in the oxt aerosols 618 221 and 35 cfu m3 respectively the results indicated that the emission level of both total microorganisms and specific pathogens generated by the horizontal rotor aeration was higher than that by the fine bubble aeration the histogram plots fig s1 illustrated that the particle size distribution of microbial aerosols generated by the two aeration modes did not conform to the lognormal distribution however the particle size distribution of the aerosols was related to the aeration modes as shown in fig 2 for the largest fraction size 7 μm of airborne particulate matter a higher concentration and percentage of the largest fraction of bacteria 1005 cfu m3 23 66 fungi 460 cfu m3 20 00 enterobacteriaceae 243 cfu m3 25 00 staphylococcus aureus 106 cfu m3 26 25 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 9 cfu m3 25 00 were detected in the oda aerosols the concentrations and percentages of the largest fraction of bacteria 203 cfu m3 10 47 fungi 61 cfu m3 5 88 enterobacteriaceae 80 cfu m3 12 86 staphylococcus aureus 46 cfu m3 21 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 0 cfu m3 0 were detected in oxt aerosols the coarse fraction of airborne particulate matter is typically associated with other particles which is more easily emitted under the force of splashing than bubble bursting uhrbrand et al 2017 coarse fraction of aerosol particulate matter generated by horizontal rotor aeration also resulted in a higher degree deposition occurring in the nose and oral cavity the results showed that rf concentrations and proportions of the aerosols from the two modes have different characteristics first the rf proportion in aerosols from fine bubble aeration is much higher than that from horizontal rotor aeration rf proportions of bacteria 62 46 and 38 32 enterobacteriaceae 56 17 and 43 00 staphylococcus aureus 48 00 and 45 82 pseudomonas aeruginosa 50 00 and 33 32 and fungi 53 09 and 40 26 were detected in the oxt and oda aerosols respectively however in terms of generation concentration the rf concentrations of aerosols generated by fine bubble aeration and horizontal rotor aeration were equivalent rf concentrations of bacteria 1212 and 1628 cfu m3 enterobacteriaceae 347 and 418 cfu m3 staphylococcus aureus 106 and 185 cfu m3 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 and 18 cfu m3 were detected in the oxt and oda aerosols respectively the rf concentrations of detected microorganisms generated by the two aeration modes were all higher compared to those at control site thereby indicating a higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections and inflammation for oda and oxt 3 2 microbial population as shown in fig 3 a the predominant bacterial genera in the wastewater were norank f saprospiraceae in the oda wastewater 8 74 and oxt wastewater 9 07 while in the aerosols geothrix at the oda 13 00 and candidatus at the oxt 9 56 were predominant the types of predominant fungal genera in the aerosols and corresponding wastewater were same but with different relative abundance the predominant fungal genus in the wastewater was cladosporium in the oda wastewater 12 08 and oxt wastewater 11 45 as well as in the aerosols at the oda 13 64 and oxt 14 25 fig 3b linking nmds plots to cluster overlays and dendrogram showed that the microbial populations in wastewater from the oda and oxt were nearly the same fig 4 the bacterial fig 4a and fungal fig 4b genera in the aerosols generated by the horizontal rotor aeration all had a higher similarity to the wastewater than those generated by fine bubble aeration as determined by the distance between the two points the anosim and simper analysis table s2 also indicated that the similarity of the bacteria in the wastewater between oda and oxt was 97 23 global test p 0 01 and that of fungi was 95 55 global test p 0 03 as shown in table s3 the dissimilarity of the bacteria between the oxt aerosols and oxt wastewater 30 05 pairwise test p 0 1 was higher than that between the oda aerosols and oda wastewater 26 12 pairwise test p 0 1 which was similar to the fungi between the aerosols and corresponding wastewater at the oxt 45 81 pairwise test p 0 33 and oda 30 38 pairwise test p 0 1 as shown in table s3 a significant difference of the bacteria in aerosols was observed between the oda and oxt with a dissimilarity of 41 03 pairwise test p 0 04 and that of the fungi was 37 25 pairwise test p 0 03 3 3 potential pathogens in this study 44 types of potential bacterial pathogens were detected in all samples by referring to the database of human pathogens woolhouse et al 2012 and 39 and 31 potential bacterial pathogens were found in oda and oxt aerosols with a total relative abundance of 1 51e 02 and 7 56e 02 fig 5 a and b table s4 respectively it was clear that oda aerosols had more types of potential bacterial pathogens than oxt aerosols but had a lower total relative abundance the predominant potential bacterial pathogen in the aerosols was arcobacter at the oda 7 20e 03 and oxt 5 60e 03 venn diagrams fig 5a and b showed that 34 39 and 29 31 out of the potential bacterial pathogens detected in the oda and oxt aerosols were shared with the corresponding wastewater respectively meanwhile 11 34 and 11 29 out of the shared between aerosols with corresponding wastewater at oda and oxt respectively had higher relative abundance compared to those at control site these indicated that the wastewater could be regarded as important source of potential bacterial pathogens in aerosols however coxiella fusobacterium psychrobacter and stenotrophomonas detected in oda aerosols and achromobacter and propionibacterium detected in oxt aerosols were not identified in the corresponding wastewater fig 5a and b this may be affected by other sources such like soil plant material and dry material dust uhrbrand et al 2017 relatively few types of potential fungal pathogens were detected in all the samples fig 5c and d table s5 a total of 5 5 and 3 4 out of the potential fungal pathogens detected in the oda fig 5c and oxt fig 5d aerosols were shared with corresponding wastewater among them aspergillus 4 49e 02 and 3 48e 02 cladosporium 1 36e 01 and 1 42e 01 cryptococcus 9 15e 04 and 6 58e 04 and pseudallescheria 1 10e 03 and 4 92e 03 detected in oda and oxt aerosols and trichosporon 3 01e 02 only detected in oda aerosols all had higher relative abundance compared to those at control site all this indicated that the wastewater were the important source of potential fungal pathogens in aerosols different aeration modes had different effects on the richness and abundance of emitted potential pathogens from corresponding wastewater among these only shared between aerosols and corresponding wastewater fig 5 tables s4 and s5 acidaminococcus 4 23e 05 dermatophilus 1 69e 04 escherichia 1 06e 04 leptotrichia 2 68e 04 and cryptococcus 9 15e 04 were detected in oda aerosols meawhile dermatophilus 1 69e 04 escherichia 1 83e 03 and cryptococcus 6 58e 04 were detected in oxt aerosols acidaminococcus is an important bacterial genus that can cause periodontitis contreras et al 2000 and bacterial vaginosis zozaya hinchliffe et al 2008 dermatophilus most notably d congolensis can cause skin infections in humans such as pustular dermatitis burd et al 2007 many escherichia are human pathogens associated with urinary tract infections janne et al 2019 and gastrointestinal disease adesiyan et al 2019 leptotrichia species are also associated with periodontal diseases and oral cavity abscesses kumagai et al 2013 muttaiyah et al 2007 sassone et al 2007 most species of cryptococcus live in soil and are not injurious to humans but c neoformans is a major human and animal pathogen cheng et al 2001 3 4 chemical composition a previous study has suggested that cl in anions in aerosols from nine wwtps showed a positive correlation with others dissolved in particulate matter han et al 2018 the formation of so4 2 and no3 increased the pollution during hazy days wang et al 2006 thus cl so4 2 and no3 were measured in this study fig 6 a cl no3 and so4 2 at concentrations of 54 11 37 99 and 36 54 μg m3 in oda aerosols and at 43 91 42 61 and 30 46 μg m3 in oxt aerosols were detected respectively in this study the horizontal rotor aeration generated a higher concentration of cl and so4 2 and a lower concentration of no3 in the aerosols than those of the fine bubble aeration 24 types of metal loid s were detected in all airborne samples with the concentrations of 2 08e 05 5 46e 01 μg m3 fig 6b obtained results indicated that aerosols generated by horizontal rotor aeration had higher fe al li ti cu mo u mn as co cr ni k na p and s concentrations but lower zn ba cd sc v rb ca mg and si concentrations than those generated by fine bubble aeration s had the highest concentration 54 58 μg m3 in oda aerosols and na had the highest concentration 36 04 μg m3 in oxt aerosols among all the detected metal loid s the ratios of each chemical concentration to the tsps after log10 x 1 transformation were used for the analysis of nmds linking to cluster overlays and dendrograms fig 6c which illustrated the similarity of chemicals in aerosols to corresponding wastewater compared to the chemical composition in aerosols generated by fine bubble aeration those generated by horizontal rotor aeration had a higher similarity to corresponding wastewater fig 6c the anosim and simper analyses indicated that the chemical compositions in wastewater from the oda and oxt were nearly the same with a similarity of 99 28 table s2 global test at significance level p 0 04 as shown in table s3 the dissimilarity of the chemical composition between the oxt aerosols and oxt wastewater 48 42 pairwise test p 0 01 was higher than that between the oda aerosols and oda wastewater 45 10 pairwise test p 0 01 a dissimilarity of 5 52 table s3 pairwise test p 0 33 was observed in the chemicals between the oda aerosols and oxt aerosols the dissimilarity of the chemicals 5 52 in the aerosols generated by the two aeration modes was lower than that of the bacteria 41 03 and fungi 37 25 3 5 contribution of aeration mode to the aerosol emissions from wastewater as shown in table 1 for both total microorganisms and specific pathogens in wwtp aerosols the contribution of horizontal rotor aeration was higher than that of fine bubble aeration to the emission of microbial aerosols for example the ratio of bacteria generated by the horizontal rotor aeration was 3 69e 11 which was higher than that generated by fine bubble aeration 1 06e 11 in addition the aeration both horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration had higher contributions for specific pathogens than for total microorganisms table 1 for cl so4 2 no3 zn ba cd sc v rb ca k ca k mg na and si in the aerosols the contributions of fine bubble aeration were higher than those of horizontal rotor aeration fig 7 in addition for si fe al ti cu mo u mn as co cr ni p and s horizontal rotor aeration had higher contributions to their emissions both horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration had the highest contributions to the emission of s among all the detected chemicals with ratios of 2 88e 01 and 2 01e 01 respectively among these detected potential pathogens in the oda and oxt aerosols escherichia collinsella dermatophilus acidaminococcus and trichosporon in oda aerosols and mycobacterium gordonia escherichia chryseobacterium dermatophilus dermatophilus and pseudallescheria in oxt aerosols could be easily aerosolized af value 1 table s6 the most easily aerosolized genera at oda and oxt were trichosporon and mycobacterium with af values of 633 70 and 192 56 table s6 respectively 4 discussion driving manners yang et al 2019 source properties han et al 2018 and meteorological conditions zhen et al 2017 could all effect the characteristics of aerosols from wwtps this study was conducted at the same wwtp with nearly the same wastewater properties bacteria fungi and chemicals figs 4 and 6c and identical macro meteorological conditions thus the difference of aeration modes may be the main reasons for the difference of aerosol characteristics the results of this study indicated that the bacteria fungi and chemicals in the aerosols generated by the horizontal rotor aeration had a higher similarities to wastewater than those generated by fine bubble aeration figs 4 and 6c meanwhile more types of potential pathogens specific to the wastewater were found in the aerosols generated by the horizontal rotor aeration fig 5 this is mainly due to the characteristics of the aeration mode horizontal rotor aeration refers to the horizontal rotors rotating to form a negative pressure zone on the rear side which can absorb part of the air thereby causing a water jump accompanied by vigorous stirring at the liquid level meanwhile a mixture of wastewater and sludge is directly thrown out of the water air interface to form aerosols however bubble aeration is the transmission of air into the wastewater treatment system through air blasting at the same time when the bubbles rise to the water air interface and burst the particles of the wastewater sludge mixture are carried into the air to form aerosols ochowiak and matuszak 2017 wang et al 2019 thus during the process of aerosolization wastewater sludge had important contribute to aerosol formation han et al 2018 sánchez monedero et al 2008 but variation in driving manner results in a difference in aerosol characteristics the previous studies suggested that the size distribution and morphology of active sludge flocs may be affected by the shear mode and shear force of different aeration modes except the nature of the escape source argyropoulos and markatos 2015 chen et al 2016 liu et al 2015 oyegbile et al 2016 wang et al 2019 in this study the size of activated sludge flocs from oda and oxt were respectively detected the result showed that activated sludge flocs from oda presented smaller median diameter than that from oxt fig 8 from this aspect the horizontal rotor aeration has stronger shear force than bubble aeration however it is found that bubble aeration mainly generated rf aerosols and horizontal rotor aeration mainly generated aerosols with larger particle size 7 0 μm aerosols and rf therefore the shearing force of aeration mode itself is not the final reason for the different characteristics of aerosol particle size distribution under two aeration modes further in depth analyzing of aerosol generating process under different aeration modes aerosols from horizontal rotor aeration relies mainly on the horizontal rotor to carry activated sludge particles break through the water air interface into air are formed so activated sludge flocs in wastewater biological treatment unit is the direct source of aerosol in the process of bubble aeration when the bubbles carrying activated sludge flocs reach the water air interface they burst and form smaller droplets wang et al 2019 these droplets enter the air to form aerosols therefore these smaller droplets produced by bubble burst should be the direct source of aerosols generated by bubble aeration this also reveals the reasons of aerosols from fine bubble aeration are smaller in size and more evenly distributed relative to the generation of horizontal rotor aeration in this study of course with the increase of bubbles coarse and medium bubbles the aerosol particle size generated by bubble aeration may also increase fernando and fedorak et al 2005 sánchez monedero et al 2008 wastewater is the main source of aerosol pollutants in wwtps and the contributions of the horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration to the aerosol emissions from the wastewater were different which is governed by the specialty of the aeration devices and the corresponding operating parameters on the whole aerosols generated by both aeration modes need control and different control strategies should be selected to target aerosols with different characteristics however the result of this study only reflects the characteristics of aerosol samples at a single independent sampling site under two aeration modes according to the mode characteristics of this research the fine bubble aeration is basically in uniform distribution throughout the whole aeration tank while the horizontal rotors are only in a certain position in the oxidation ditch tank therefore further research is needed on aerosol flux and control threshold under different aeration modes active control and protective strategies such as that employees wear masks and work clothes covering the main emission sites and collecting and inactivating of aerosols were suggested 5 conclusions the characteristics of aerosols originated from horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration in the same wwtp were studied the following conclusions can be drawn from the results 1 for both total microorganisms and specific pathogens in wwtp aerosols the contributions of the horizontal rotor aeration were higher than those of the fine bubble aeration to the emission of microbial aerosols 2 bacteria fungi and chemicals in the aerosols generated by horizontal rotor aeration had higher similarities to wastewater than those generated by fine bubble aeration 3 escherichia collinsella dermatophilus acidaminococcus and trichosporon in aerosols generated by horizontal rotor aeration and mycobacterium gordonia escherichia chryseobacterium dermatophilus dermatophilus and pseudallescheria in aerosols generated by fine bubble aeration could be easily aerosolized 4 the contributions of the horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration to the aerosol emissions size distributions microorganism and chemicals from the wastewater were different which were governed by the specifications of the aeration devices so different control strategies should be selected to target aerosols from different aeration modes declaration of competing

18261,aeration and mechanical agitation are the main drivers of aerosol generation in wastewater treatment plants wwtps however the effect of aeration mode on aerosol characteristics remains poorly understood in this study horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration in the same wwtp were selected to identify the effect on the emission size distribution microbial and chemical composition for bacteria fungi enterobacteriaceae staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa in aerosols the horizontal rotor aeration had higher contributions to the emissions than the fine bubble aeration horizontal rotor aeration generated a more coarse fraction size 7 μm and a comparable respirable fraction rf size 3 3 μm compared with those of fine bubble aeration more types of potential pathogens were generated by horizontal rotor aeration the most easily aerosolized genera generated by horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration were trichosporon and mycobacterium with the aerosolization factors of 633 70 and 192 56 respectively for cl so4 2 no3 zn ba cd sc v rb ca k ca k mg na and si in the aerosols the contributions of fine bubble aeration were higher than those of horizontal rotor aeration due to the aerosol specialty from the different aeration modes targeted manipulations should be employed to reduce the exposure risks graphical abstract image 1 keywords wastewater treatment plant horizontal rotor aeration fine bubble aeration aerosols characteristics 1 introduction aerosols originating from wastewater treatment plants wwtps have been confirmed to contain some hazardous components such as pathogenic bacteria korzeniewska et al 2009 uhrbrand et al 2017 fungi kowalski et al 2017 viruses masclaux et al 2014 uhrbrand et al 2017 and chemicals gangamma et al 2011 han et al 2018 these hazardous components have the potential to infect humans particularly workers at wwtps through inhalation dermal contact and ingestion sánchez monedero et al 2008 stellacci et al 2010 an illness among workers at wwtps termed sewage worker s syndrome has been reported rylander et al 1976 thus aerosol characteristics and risk assessment from wwtps have attracted increasingly more attention the main aerosol emission sources are the biological treatment unit and sludge dewatering room and aeration and mechanical agitation play an important role in aerosol generation in wwtps kowalski et al 2017 sánchez monedero et al 2008 yang et al 2019 studies regarding the effect of aeration systems on the levels of culturable airborne microorganisms have been widely conducted brandi et al 2000 found that mechanical aeration generates more aerosol bacteria and fungi than fine bubble diffusion compared from the perspective of different wwtps similar results of culturable airborne bacteria were also reported by sánchez monedero et al 2008 fernando and fedorak 2005 discovered a prominent decrease in airborne microorganism concentrations because of a change in the aeration system from coarse to fine bubble aeration during the process of biological nutrient removal apart from airborne microorganism concentrations size distribution and microbial population are also typical characteristics of aerosols related to human health uhrbrand et al 2017 wang et al 2018a xu et al 2018 it has been well known that aerosol particle size is closely related to particle deposition in the human respiratory tract pastuszka et al 2000 for example particles with diameters of 5 10 μm can adhere to the surface of the upper airway and cause disease such as rhinitis particles 5 μm diameter are strongly accompanied by a gas stream and can easily reach the alveoli nel 2005 nel et al 2006 airborne particulates with an aerodynamic diameter of 3 3 μm have been stipulated as the respirable fraction rf uhrbrand et al 2017 even worse specific pathogens associated with smaller size airborne particulates may increase these risks katsivela et al 2017 there is limited knowledge regarding the effect of aeration mode on the microbial population and size distribution particularly pathogens of aerosols from wwtps in addition the current analysis of hazardous components in aerosols have mainly focused on potential pathogens uhrbrand et al 2017 yang et al 2019 and very few of that have focused on hazardous chemicals some toxic metal loid s such as co cr ni and cd have been detected in atmospheric aerosols charlesworth et al 2011 wu et al 2007 stationary diesel engine exhaust betha and balasubramanian 2011 street dust zheng et al 2010 and mining infrastructure kim et al 2002 these toxic metal loid s in aerosols have been proven to be harmful to human health fang et al 2010 okuda et al 2008 wei and yang 2010 however the toxic metal loid s in wwtp aerosols and the effect of aeration mode on their characteristics have not been extensively studied therefore a systematic and comprehensive understanding of the effect of aeration mode on aerosol characteristics is quite necessary some studies have shown that aerosol composition is closely related to wastewater and sludge properties wang et al 2018b yang et al 2019 when a wastewater or sludge property changes the aerosol composition may be significantly different han et al 2018 yang et al 2019 comparing the effect of aeration mode on aerosol characteristics in different wwtps may be disturbed by water quality and sludge properties based on the aforementioned problems this work was conducted at a practical wwtp including an oxidation ditch od process with horizontal rotor aeration and an anaerobic anoxic oxic a2 o process with fine bubble aeration the emission level particle size distribution microbial and chemical compositions of aerosols from the two aeration modes were respectively analyzed via field sampling particular attention was also paid to pathogens and toxic metal loid s the similarities of bacteria fungi and chemicals in aerosols from two aeration modes to wastewater were investigated the contributions of the two aeration modes to the emissions of microorganism and chemicals in aerosols were studied the influence of aeration mode on aerosol characteristics is clearly explained providing a scientific basis for aerosol risk assessment 2 materials and methods 2 1 studied sites and aeration modes sampling was conducted at a municipal wwtp in guangzhou 114 11 e 2 79 n the present study was performed in summer june 20 2018 there are two biological processes used at this wwtp the od and a2 o processes respectively the influent flowed through a coarse screen where larger suspended solids were intercepted after elevation by the boost pump room wastewater passed through a fine grid and aerated grit chamber then the mixed liquor was assigned to the od and a2 o processes at the same capacity of 2 50 104 m3 d the do concentrations of the aeration banks were 2 37 0 52 mg l and 2 41 0 90 mg l in the a2 o and od processes at this wwtp respectively the cod bod5 tn and tp of the effluent were 33 25 10 14 16 36 and 0 71 mg l in the a2 o process and 31 95 8 86 15 92 and 0 68 mg l in the od process respectively thereby indicating good treatment efficiency horizontal rotors were used for aeration in the od process with a rotor diameter of 1000 mm immersion depth of 200 mm rotational speed of 72 3 r min and motor power of 45 kw fine bubble aeration was used in the oxic tank of the a2 o process with a dynamic electricity of 3 4 kg o2 kwh air diffusers for fine bubble aeration were installed with a diameter of 500 mm and could produce bubbles with a diameter of 1 5 3 0 mm during the sampling period the wind direction was east with a speed of 1 7 0 8 m s sampling sites were established upwind uw as a control at the air water interfaces of the od 0 5 m after the rotating brushes oda and at the air water interfaces of the oxic tank in the a2 o process oxt fig 1 wastewater from the oda and oxt were also collected during the sampling periods the quality of mixed liquor is described in table s1 2 2 aerosol collection six stage andersen impactors with aerodynamic cut size diameters of 7 0 4 7 3 3 2 1 1 1 and 0 65 μm uhrbrand et al 2017 were employed to collect culturable airborne microorganisms over a period of 2 min at a flow rate of 28 3 l min bacteria and fungi were collected using a nutrient medium and rose bengal medium oxoid ltd basingstoke uk and cultivated at 37 1 c for 48 h and 25 28 c for 72 h respectively apart from bacteria and fungi particular attention was also paid to enterobacteriaceae staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa the detection of enterobacteriaceae reflects the degree of aerosol pollution from the wastewater and is an important indicator when controlling air quality at wwtps gotkowska płachta et al 2013 korzeniewska et al 2009 staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa are also important indicators of pathogenic bacteria in toxicological and epidemiological studies chen et al 2018 landrum et al 2012 enterobacteriaceae staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were collected using a macconkey medium baird parker medium and pseudomonas cn medium oxoid ltd basingstoke uk and incubated at 30 35 c for 18 24 h 36 1 c for 45 48 h and 37 1 c for 48 h respectively three replicates were repeated at each site and collection of

analyzed samples and the results were amended via subtraction of the filter blanks 2 5 contribution of aeration mode to the aerosol emissions from wastewater for the culturable microorganisms and chemicals in aerosols the background in terms of uw concentrations were deducted from the results measured at the oxt and oda and the ratios were defined as the concentration in the aerosols to that in the wastewater which were used to evaluate the contributions of different aeration modes to emission levels in addition for microbial populations the aerosolization potential of certain taxa in aerosols from different aeration modes was assessed using the aerosolization factor af based on eq 1 michaud et al 2018 where if the af is higher than 1 then the microorganism is easy to aerosolize or is air enriched in contrast if the af is less than 1 then this microorganism is not easy to become aerosolized into the air from the wastewater 1 a f r e l a t i v e a b u n d a n c e w w t p a e r o

square root transformation and the ratios of the chemical concentrations to tsps which were log10 x 1 transformed were used for multivariate statistical analysis heatmaps were utilized to indicate the bacterial and fungal genera that were most frequently found in the different environments the similarities of the chemical compositions and bacterial and fungal populations in aerosols to wastewater were illustrated using non metric multidimensional scaling ordination nmds linking to cluster overlays and dendrogram analysis of similarity anosim test and similarity percentage simper analysis heatmap nmds anosim and simper analyses were conducted using primer version 7 0 clarke and gorley 2015 3 results 3 1 emission levels and size distributions of airborne microorganisms fig 2 illustrated the concentrations of culturable airborne microorganisms associated with size segregated airborne particulate matter the total concentration of bacteria and fungi fig 2a and b in oda aerosols was as high as 4249 and 2296 cfu m3 more than twice that 1941 and 1051 cfu m3 in oxt aerosols this result of bacteria was similar to that of a previous study sánchez monedero et al 2008 enterobacteriaceae staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa fig 2c e in the oda aerosols had a total concentration of 972 403 and 53 cfu m3 and in the oxt aerosols 618 221 and 35 cfu m3 respectively the results indicated that the emission level of both total microorganisms and specific pathogens generated by the horizontal rotor aeration was higher than that by the fine bubble aeration the histogram plots fig s1 illustrated that the particle size distribution of microbial aerosols generated by the two aeration modes did not conform to the lognormal distribution however the particle size distribution of the aerosols was related to the aeration modes as shown in fig 2 for the largest fraction size 7 μm of airborne particulate matter a higher concentration and percentage of the largest fraction of bacteria 1005 cfu m3 23 66 fungi 460 cfu m3 20 00 enterobacteriaceae 243 cfu m3 25 00 staphylococcus aureus 106 cfu m3 26 25 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 9 cfu m3 25 00 were detected in the oda aerosols the concentrations and percentages of the largest fraction of bacteria 203 cfu m3 10 47 fungi 61 cfu m3 5 88 enterobacteriaceae 80 cfu m3 12 86 staphylococcus aureus 46 cfu m3 21 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 0 cfu m3 0 were detected in oxt aerosols the coarse fraction of airborne particulate matter is typically associated with other particles which is more easily emitted under the force of splashing than bubble bursting uhrbrand et al 2017 coarse fraction of aerosol particulate matter generated by horizontal rotor aeration also resulted in a higher degree deposition occurring in the nose and oral cavity the results showed that rf concentrations and proportions of the aerosols from the two modes have different characteristics first the rf proportion in aerosols from fine bubble aeration is much higher than that from horizontal rotor aeration rf proportions of bacteria 62 46 and 38 32 enterobacteriaceae 56 17 and 43 00 staphylococcus aureus 48 00 and 45 82 pseudomonas aeruginosa 50 00 and 33 32 and fungi 53 09 and 40 26 were detected in the oxt and oda aerosols respectively however in terms of generation concentration the rf concentrations of aerosols generated by fine bubble aeration and horizontal rotor aeration were equivalent rf concentrations of bacteria 1212 and 1628 cfu m3 enterobacteriaceae 347 and 418 cfu m3 staphylococcus aureus 106 and 185 cfu m3 and pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 and 18 cfu m3 were detected in the oxt and oda aerosols respectively the rf concentrations of detected microorganisms generated by the two aeration modes were all higher compared to those at control site thereby indicating a higher risk of lower respiratory tract infections and inflammation for oda and oxt 3 2 microbial population as shown in fig 3 a the predominant bacterial genera in the wastewater were norank f saprospiraceae in the oda wastewater 8 74 and oxt wastewater 9 07 while in the aerosols geothrix at the oda 13 00 and candidatus at the oxt 9 56 were predominant the types of predominant fungal genera in the aerosols and corresponding wastewater were same but with different relative abundance the predominant fungal genus in the wastewater was cladosporium in the oda wastewater 12 08 and oxt wastewater 11 45 as well as in the aerosols at the oda 13 64 and oxt 14 25 fig 3b linking nmds plots to cluster overlays and dendrogram showed that the microbial populations in wastewater from the oda and oxt were nearly the same fig 4 the bacterial fig 4a and fungal fig 4b genera in the aerosols generated by the horizontal rotor aeration all had a higher similarity to the wastewater than those generated by fine bubble aeration as determined by the distance between the two points the anosim and simper analysis table s2 also indicated that the similarity of the bacteria in the wastewater between oda and oxt was 97 23 global test p 0 01 and that of fungi was 95 55 global test p 0 03 as shown in table s3 the dissimilarity of the bacteria between the oxt aerosols and oxt wastewater 30 05 pairwise test p 0 1 was higher than that between the oda aerosols and oda wastewater 26 12 pairwise test p 0 1 which was similar to the fungi between the aerosols and corresponding wastewater at the oxt 45 81 pairwise test p 0 33 and oda 30 38 pairwise test p 0 1 as shown in table s3 a significant difference of the bacteria in aerosols was observed between the oda and oxt with a dissimilarity of 41 03 pairwise test p 0 04 and that of the fungi was 37 25 pairwise test p 0 03 3 3 potential pathogens in this study 44 types of potential bacterial pathogens were detected in all samples by referring to the database of human pathogens woolhouse et al 2012 and 39 and 31 potential bacterial pathogens were found in oda and oxt aerosols with a total relative abundance of 1 51e 02 and 7 56e 02 fig 5 a and b table s4 respectively it was clear that oda aerosols had more types of potential bacterial pathogens than oxt aerosols but had a lower total relative abundance the predominant potential bacterial pathogen in the aerosols was arcobacter at the oda 7 20e 03 and oxt 5 60e 03 venn diagrams fig 5a and b showed that 34 39 and 29 31 out of the potential bacterial pathogens detected in the oda and oxt aerosols were shared with the corresponding wastewater respectively meanwhile 11 34 and 11 29 out of the shared between aerosols with corresponding wastewater at oda and oxt respectively had higher relative abundance compared to those at control site these indicated that the wastewater could be regarded as important source of potential bacterial pathogens in aerosols however coxiella fusobacterium psychrobacter and stenotrophomonas detected in oda aerosols and achromobacter and propionibacterium detected in oxt aerosols were not identified in the corresponding wastewater fig 5a and b this may be affected by other sources such like soil plant material and dry material dust uhrbrand et al 2017 relatively few types of potential fungal pathogens were detected in all the samples fig 5c and d table s5 a total of 5 5 and 3 4 out of the potential fungal pathogens detected in the oda fig 5c and oxt fig 5d aerosols were shared with corresponding wastewater among them aspergillus 4 49e 02 and 3 48e 02 cladosporium 1 36e 01 and 1 42e 01 cryptococcus 9 15e 04 and 6 58e 04 and pseudallescheria 1 10e 03 and 4 92e 03 detected in oda and oxt aerosols and trichosporon 3 01e 02 only detected in oda aerosols all had higher relative abundance compared to those at control site all this indicated that the wastewater were the important source of potential fungal pathogens in aerosols different aeration modes had different effects on the richness and abundance of emitted potential pathogens from corresponding wastewater among these only shared between aerosols and corresponding wastewater fig 5 tables s4 and s5 acidaminococcus 4 23e 05 dermatophilus 1 69e 04 escherichia 1 06e 04 leptotrichia 2 68e 04 and cryptococcus 9 15e 04 were detected in oda aerosols meawhile dermatophilus 1 69e 04 escherichia 1 83e 03 and cryptococcus 6 58e 04 were detected in oxt aerosols acidaminococcus is an important bacterial genus that can cause periodontitis contreras et al 2000 and bacterial vaginosis zozaya hinchliffe et al 2008 dermatophilus most notably d congolensis can cause skin infections in humans such as pustular dermatitis burd et al 2007 many escherichia are human pathogens associated with urinary tract infections janne et al 2019 and gastrointestinal disease adesiyan et al 2019 leptotrichia species are also associated with periodontal diseases and oral cavity abscesses kumagai et al 2013 muttaiyah et al 2007 sassone et al 2007 most species of cryptococcus live in soil and are not injurious to humans but c neoformans is a major human and animal pathogen cheng et al 2001 3 4 chemical composition a previous study has suggested that cl in anions in aerosols from nine wwtps showed a positive correlation with others dissolved in particulate matter han et al 2018 the formation of so4 2 and no3 increased the pollution during hazy days wang et al 2006 thus cl so4 2 and no3 were measured in this study fig 6 a cl no3 and so4 2 at concentrations of 54 11 37 99 and 36 54 μg m3 in oda aerosols and at 43 91 42 61 and 30 46 μg m3 in oxt aerosols were detected respectively in this study the horizontal rotor aeration generated a higher concentration of cl and so4 2 and a lower concentration of no3 in the aerosols than those of the fine bubble aeration 24 types of metal loid s were detected in all airborne samples with the concentrations of 2 08e 05 5 46e 01 μg m3 fig 6b obtained results indicated that aerosols generated by horizontal rotor aeration had higher fe al li ti cu mo u mn as co cr ni k na p and s concentrations but lower zn ba cd sc v rb ca mg and si concentrations than those generated by fine bubble aeration s had the highest concentration 54 58 μg m3 in oda aerosols and na had the highest concentration 36 04 μg m3 in oxt aerosols among all the detected metal loid s the ratios of each chemical concentration to the tsps after log10 x 1 transformation were used for the analysis of nmds linking to cluster overlays and dendrograms fig 6c which illustrated the similarity of chemicals in aerosols to corresponding wastewater compared to the chemical composition in aerosols generated by fine bubble aeration those generated by horizontal rotor aeration had a higher similarity to corresponding wastewater fig 6c the anosim and simper analyses indicated that the chemical compositions in wastewater from the oda and oxt were nearly the same with a similarity of 99 28 table s2 global test at significance level p 0 04 as shown in table s3 the dissimilarity of the chemical composition between the oxt aerosols and oxt wastewater 48 42 pairwise test p 0 01 was higher than that between the oda aerosols and oda wastewater 45 10 pairwise test p 0 01 a dissimilarity of 5 52 table s3 pairwise test p 0 33 was observed in the chemicals between the oda aerosols and oxt aerosols the dissimilarity of the chemicals 5 52 in the aerosols generated by the two aeration modes was lower than that of the bacteria 41 03 and fungi 37 25 3 5 contribution of aeration mode to the aerosol emissions from wastewater as shown in table 1 for both total microorganisms and specific pathogens in wwtp aerosols the contribution of horizontal rotor aeration was higher than that of fine bubble aeration to the emission of microbial aerosols for example the ratio of bacteria generated by the horizontal rotor aeration was 3 69e 11 which was higher than that generated by fine bubble aeration 1 06e 11 in addition the aeration both horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration had higher contributions for specific pathogens than for total microorganisms table 1 for cl so4 2 no3 zn ba cd sc v rb ca k ca k mg na and si in the aerosols the contributions of fine bubble aeration were higher than those of horizontal rotor aeration fig 7 in addition for si fe al ti cu mo u mn as co cr ni p and s horizontal rotor aeration had higher contributions to their emissions both horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration had the highest contributions to the emission of s among all the detected chemicals with ratios of 2 88e 01 and 2 01e 01 respectively among these detected potential pathogens in the oda and oxt aerosols escherichia collinsella dermatophilus acidaminococcus and trichosporon in oda aerosols and mycobacterium gordonia escherichia chryseobacterium dermatophilus dermatophilus and pseudallescheria in oxt aerosols could be easily aerosolized af value 1 table s6 the most easily aerosolized genera at oda and oxt were trichosporon and mycobacterium with af values of 633 70 and 192 56 table s6 respectively 4 discussion driving manners yang et al 2019 source properties han et al 2018 and meteorological conditions zhen et al 2017 could all effect the characteristics of aerosols from wwtps this study was conducted at the same wwtp with nearly the same wastewater properties bacteria fungi and chemicals figs 4 and 6c and identical macro meteorological conditions thus the difference of aeration modes may be the main reasons for the difference of aerosol characteristics the results of this study indicated that the bacteria fungi and chemicals in the aerosols generated by the horizontal rotor aeration had a higher similarities to wastewater than those generated by fine bubble aeration figs 4 and 6c meanwhile more types of potential pathogens specific to the wastewater were found in the aerosols generated by the horizontal rotor aeration fig 5 this is mainly due to the characteristics of the aeration mode horizontal rotor aeration refers to the horizontal rotors rotating to form a negative pressure zone on the rear side which can absorb part of the air thereby causing a water jump accompanied by vigorous stirring at the liquid level meanwhile a mixture of wastewater and sludge is directly thrown out of the water air interface to form aerosols however bubble aeration is the transmission of air into the wastewater treatment system through air blasting at the same time when the bubbles rise to the water air interface and burst the particles of the wastewater sludge mixture are carried into the air to form aerosols ochowiak and matuszak 2017 wang et al 2019 thus during the process of aerosolization wastewater sludge had important contribute to aerosol formation han et al 2018 sánchez monedero et al 2008 but variation in driving manner results in a difference in aerosol characteristics the previous studies suggested that the size distribution and morphology of active sludge flocs may be affected by the shear mode and shear force of different aeration modes except the nature of the escape source argyropoulos and markatos 2015 chen et al 2016 liu et al 2015 oyegbile et al 2016 wang et al 2019 in this study the size of activated sludge flocs from oda and oxt were respectively detected the result showed that activated sludge flocs from oda presented smaller median diameter than that from oxt fig 8 from this aspect the horizontal rotor aeration has stronger shear force than bubble aeration however it is found that bubble aeration mainly generated rf aerosols and horizontal rotor aeration mainly generated aerosols with larger particle size 7 0 μm aerosols and rf therefore the shearing force of aeration mode itself is not the final reason for the different characteristics of aerosol particle size distribution under two aeration modes further in depth analyzing of aerosol generating process under different aeration modes aerosols from horizontal rotor aeration relies mainly on the horizontal rotor to carry activated sludge particles break through the water air interface into air are formed so activated sludge flocs in wastewater biological treatment unit is the direct source of aerosol in the process of bubble aeration when the bubbles carrying activated sludge flocs reach the water air interface they burst and form smaller droplets wang et al 2019 these droplets enter the air to form aerosols therefore these smaller droplets produced by bubble burst should be the direct source of aerosols generated by bubble aeration this also reveals the reasons of aerosols from fine bubble aeration are smaller in size and more evenly distributed relative to the generation of horizontal rotor aeration in this study of course with the increase of bubbles coarse and medium bubbles the aerosol particle size generated by bubble aeration may also increase fernando and fedorak et al 2005 sánchez monedero et al 2008 wastewater is the main source of aerosol pollutants in wwtps and the contributions of the horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration to the aerosol emissions from the wastewater were different which is governed by the specialty of the aeration devices and the corresponding operating parameters on the whole aerosols generated by both aeration modes need control and different control strategies should be selected to target aerosols with different characteristics however the result of this study only reflects the characteristics of aerosol samples at a single independent sampling site under two aeration modes according to the mode characteristics of this research the fine bubble aeration is basically in uniform distribution throughout the whole aeration tank while the horizontal rotors are only in a certain position in the oxidation ditch tank therefore further research is needed on aerosol flux and control threshold under different aeration modes active control and protective strategies such as that employees wear masks and work clothes covering the main emission sites and collecting and inactivating of aerosols were suggested 5 conclusions the characteristics of aerosols originated from horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration in the same wwtp were studied the following conclusions can be drawn from the results 1 for both total microorganisms and specific pathogens in wwtp aerosols the contributions of the horizontal rotor aeration were higher than those of the fine bubble aeration to the emission of microbial aerosols 2 bacteria fungi and chemicals in the aerosols generated by horizontal rotor aeration had higher similarities to wastewater than those generated by fine bubble aeration 3 escherichia collinsella dermatophilus acidaminococcus and trichosporon in aerosols generated by horizontal rotor aeration and mycobacterium gordonia escherichia chryseobacterium dermatophilus dermatophilus and pseudallescheria in aerosols generated by fine bubble aeration could be easily aerosolized 4 the contributions of the horizontal rotor aeration and fine bubble aeration to the aerosol emissions size distributions microorganism and chemicals from the wastewater were different which were governed by the specifications of the aeration devices so different control strategies should be selected to target aerosols from different aeration modes declaration of competing

18262,microplastics mps discharged into the natural environment undergo various wearthering pathways such as mechanical abrasion and ultraviolet uv irradiation however little is known about the effects of such aged mps on the bioavailability of hydrophobic organic compounds hocs in aqueous environments to simulate the natural oxidation and uv ageing process of mps three kinds of modified polyethylene mps were obtained by plastic etching processes common in industry and uv irradiation namely etched mps emps uv aged mps uv mps and etched mps followed by uv ageing uv emps the modified mps showed a higher content of surface oxygen containing groups than the pristine mps and the specific surface area and pore volume increased significantly after etching and ultraviolet ageing especially for the emps 1 67 m2 g 1 and 0 0049 cm³ g 1 and uv emps 2 37 m2 g 1 and 0 0089 cm³ g 1 the effect of modified mps on the availability of 10 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs logk ow 4 18 6 20 was evaluated by negligible depletion solid phase microextraction nd spme the free concentrations cfree of most pahs except for less hydrophobic pahs logk ow 4 18 and 4 56 decreased with an increasing concentration of mps the logarithms of the sorption coefficients of pahs with various mps logk mps logk uv mps logk emps and logk uv emps were linearly correlated with logk ow suggesting that the sorption is hydrophobicity dependent compared with the results for pristine mps logk mp 3 80 4 95 uv ageing only slightly enhanced the sorption of pahs by mps logk uv mps 3 71 4 98 whereas the plastic etching processes significantly enhanced sorption logk emps 3 85 5 18 and logk uv emps 3 90 5 28 the sorption of pahs to mps is mainly based on partitioning however a mechanism of adsorption also likely takes place in emps and uv emps due to hydrogen bonding and π π interactions desorption study indicated that pah desorption from mps are dominated by film diffusion however intraparticle diffusion also takes great part for the emps these results suggest that modification of mps in the natural environment will change the availability of hocs graphical abstract image 1

according to their sources and petroleum derived polymers and can be subdivided into polyethylene polystyrene and other types of plastics depending on the polymerized monomers rochman et al 2013a rostkowski et al 2012 plastics are widely used in commercial and construction materials for their superior performance alimi et al 2018 andrady and neal 2009 however the production and recycling of plastics are seriously imbalanced only approximately one quarter or less of plastics are eventually recycled or disposed properly a large amount of plastic waste to be released into the environment due to the mismanagement of waste nizzetto et al 2016 o connor et al 2016 it is foreseeable that these plastics will be affected by many natural factors including hydrolysis photodegradation due to ultraviolet uv irradiation exposure mechanical abrasion and biodegradation alimi et al 2018 browne et al 2011 imhof et al 2012 these mps ultimately will find their way into the aqueous environment and thus likely cause environmental and health concerns due to their potential toxicity boerger et al 2010 rochman et al 2013a wegner et al 2012 mps may interact with pollutants in the aqueous environment it has been reported that mps in the aquatic environment combine with persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals holmes et al 2012 rochman et al 2013b and the concentration of pollutants in mps may even be 105 to 106 times higher than that in ambient seawater rios et al 2010 ziccardi et al 2016 because these contaminated mps may have a special trojan horse effect on organisms the interaction of mps with pollutants is increasingly being studied to better understand the risks of plastics in the environment mato et al 2001 rochman 2015 plastic products that are discharged into nature will be broken down into smaller pieces of plastic under the influence of physical chemical and biological processes auta et al 2017 romera castillo et al 2018 surface changes occur in the process of the fragmentation of mps including the peeling off of plastic surface coatings the formation of pore and changes in the mechanical strength oxygen content and molecular weight of mps gardette et al 2013 lv et al 2017 in these processes mechanical wear and photochemical degradation are considered important processes for the ageing of hydrocarbon polymers andrady 2015 gewert et al 2015 it is believed that beaches are the most favourable environment for weathering and breaking of plastics song et al 2017 ultraviolet ageing of mps involves ultraviolet absorption by photosensitive groups formation of polymer radicals oxidation reactions and so on gewert et al 2015 singh and sharma 2008 to date the mechanism of polymer degradation has been extensively studied under different environmental conditions and in simulation experiments gardette et al 2013 gewert et al 2015 p liu et al 2019b recent studies browne et al 2013 chua et al 2014 have shown that common additives in plastics such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers can be transferred to the intestinal tissues of living organisms and inhibit the feeding activity of organisms several studies have explained the interaction mechanism between uv aged mps and organic pollutants huffer and hofmann 2016 huffer et al 2018 g z liu et al 2019a however there are few studies on the influence of aged mps on the bioavailability of organic pollutants in aqueous environments and the mechanism is still unclear since the freely dissolved concentration cfree of pollutants is the driving force for the migration distribution and bioaccumulation of pollutants in the environment cfree is the most direct parameter reflecting the bioavailability of pollutants ramos et al 1998 reichenberg and mayer 2006 investigating the effect of modified mps on the availability cfree of organic pollutants will help reveal the mechanisms of bioaccumulation and biological effects of the coexistence of organic pollutants with mps in the aqueous environment research has shown that advanced oxidation processes aops are an alternative to natural ageing of mps p liu et al 2019b it is possible to shorten the ageing time required in the natural process and to help obtain modified plastics by artificially controlling the reaction conditions therefore we used a common plastic modification technology in industry chromic acid etching for plastic surface oxidation treatment ben cheikh et al 2002 bentjen et al 1992 polyethylene plastic pellets are often detected in marine and freshwater environments mintenig et al 2017 these materials have a stronger sorption capacity for environmental pollutants than other types of plastics wang et al 2018 in this study using polyethylene pe as a model mps the ageing process and mechanisms of mps modified by chromic acid etching combined with uv irradiation were investigated furthermore an equilibrium passive sampling technique negligible depletion solid phase microextraction nd spme was used to evaluate the effect of various modified mps on the availability cfree of hydrophobic organic pollutants in the aqueous environment the pdms is a viscous liquid at room temperature through which compounds can quickly diffuse gorecki et al 1999 the diffusion of contaminants from water into fibers is a passive process driven by the difference in chemical fugacities on both sides of the interface based on the theory of distribution leslie et al 2002 during the nd spme process the fibres extract only a negligible freely dissolved portion of the analyte and do not disturb the equilibrium between the freely dissolved state of the analyte and the mps bound state the conditions for correct application of nd spme are 1 there is equilibrium between the bound and free and gaseous fraction of analyte 2 the depletion of the free fraction by the extraction is negligible 3 the binding matrix does not affect the extraction heringa and hermens 2003 in our previous study hu et al 2014 the cfree value of hydrophobic organic pollutants in fullerene aqueous suspensions was determined by the nd spme method and the availability was evaluated therefore it is feasible to apply nd spme to evaluate the effect of modified mps on the availability of hydrophobic organic pollutants in aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials clear high density polyethylene

horizontally every 3 days to ensure uniform exposure two kinds of uv aged microplastic particles uv mps ultraviolet aged pristine mps and uv emps etched microplastic particles followed by ultraviolet ageing were thus obtained 2 3 structural characterization sem a scanning electron microscope fei nova nano sem was used to observe the effect of modification on the surface morphology of the mps a small sample was directly adhered to a double coated carbon conductive tab on a stub then the stub was coated with au for 60 s to enhance the sample conductivity prior to sem observation at 5 kv the results are shown in fig 1 a and fig 2 a ftir fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy was used to record changes in the functional groups of the mps before and after modification briefly the samples were dried and mixed with kbr at a ratio of 0 5 mg sample 100 mg kbr thoroughly ground and pressed into tablets then the ftir spectra were recorded using a nicolet 6700 spectrometer in the 400 4000 cm 1 region with a resolution of 1 cm 1 the air background spectrum especially carbon dioxide interference was subtracted from all samples and interferograms were collected the corresponding spectra are shown in fig 1b xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi characterization was performed to measure the change in elemental composition of the surface of the mp samples before and after modification a summary of the scanned results is shown in fig 1c the o 1s spectra of the emps uv mps and uv emps samples were recorded at 532 92 ev with a scanning step of 0 05 ev as shown in fig s3 bet n 2 the surface area the pore volume and the average pore size of the different mps were determined using gas n2 adsorption desorption with a micromeritics asap 2460 analyzer system using the brunauer emmett teller bet equation in brief 250 mg of mps was degassed for 24 h at 330 k we consider that the microplastic used in the experiment is hdpe with high temperature resistance after cooling to room temperature n2 sorption desorption analysis started at a liquid n2 temperature of 77 k the surface area was determined by the bet method using seven data sorption points between relative pressures of 0 05 and 0 3 based on monolayer adsorption theory the pore distribution was calculated from all desorption data points according to the barrett joyner halenda bjh method data are presented in fig 2b and table 1 2 4 nd spme procedure the nd spme fibres were cut to a length of 1 cm before the fibres were immersed in pure acetone for 2 h to wash away the contaminated impurities after that the acetone was filtered off to allow the fibres to dry naturally and the clean fibres were placed in 200 mesh 74 μm stainless steel mesh for subsequent testing for the commercial pdms fibers used in our experiments the pdms coating thickness was 30 μm which corresponds to 0 132 μl of pdms per cm of fiber 2 5 pah uptake kinetics in nd spme fibers and particle types influence transfer 1000 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 to an amber glass vial 1000 ml the diluted pahs were added to each bottle to obtain a working solution having a respective pah concentration of 0 5 10 μg l 1 table s1 in the support information 5 mg of different types of particles such as pristine plastics mps emps uv mps and uv emps were added to different amber glass bottles the solid to liquid ratio of microplastics to solution of 5 10 6 kg l 1 to prevent bacterial growth and minimize pah degradation 0 1 mm nan3 was added to the solution in order to fully contact the microplastics with the solvent to achieve pre equilibration of the microplastics and pahs we placed the amber glasses in a 25 c 200 rpm shaker for 7 days after the 7 days pre equilibration we placed the previously prepared stainless steel mesh with nd spme fibers in each amber glass bottle two fibers placed in each bottle represent two repetitions and the bottles were placed back into the 25 c 200 rpm shaker each bottle represents a point in time and a time curve consists of 10 time sample points so a minimum of 10 amber bottles are required to complete a time curve completion of all microplastic evaluations including blank reference requires a minimum of 50 bottles the fibers collected at 0 3 6 12 24 48 72 120 144 and 168 h respectively were used to determine the pah concentration on the fibers during the sampling process the fibers in the stainless steel mesh were transferred to a clean wet filter paper to remove water droplets attached to the surface of the fibers the fibers were then placed in a sample vial and desorbed with 100 μl of methanol for 24 h after that the analytical solution was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the specific experimental setup is described in

investigate the effects of different modified mps on the availability or cfree of pahs four batches of matrices including mps emps uv mps and uv emps were compared in each batch the matrix concentrations were set as 0 1 2 5 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 ph 7 0 the pre equilibration of the microplastics with the pahs was carried out for 7 days in a shaker after the 7 day pre equilibration the spme fibers were placed in the bottles then continue to shake in the shaker for 7 days the subsequent sampling and determination process is consistent with the previous description the pah sorption

and desorption mechanisms of pahs on different modified mps we choose phenanthrene as a model pah to conduct the sorption and desorption experiment according to the method described by seidensticker et al seidensticker et al 2017 details about the sorption experiment are shown in the supplementary materials 2 g of different modified polyethylene beads were added to various 200 ml of methanol water 20 80 v v solution in brown bottles spiked with 90 μg of phenanthrene the solution was shaking at a 20 c 150 rpm shaker for 96 h to preload phenanthrene on mps then the microplastic particles were collected and were shaken with a 100 μm sieve and rinsed three times with ultrapure water to prevent the phenanthrene fouling on the mps surface during the drying process the microplastic particles were recovered and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen fig s10 subsequently samples were extracted with cyclohexane to determine the amount of phenanthrene the concentration of phenanthrene in the plastic is mps 46 2 2 4 uv mps 46 5 2 1 emps 79 8 1 9 and uv emps 82 1 1 5 μg g 1 the experiments were performed with a 500 ml ultrapure water and 500 mg of phenanthrene preloaded microplastics in 1 l amber glass bottle which led to a solid to liquid ratio of 10 3 kg l 1 to avoid biodegradation and photooxidation we added 0 05 g l 1 nan3 and kept the bottle in the dark the bottles were continuously shaken at a speed of 150 rpm on a horizontal shaker and the temperature inside the warm shaker was set to 20 1 ml aqueous samples were collected at 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min 40 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h 120 h 144 h 196 h and 250 h and 10 μl of deuterated internal standard was added to the samples subsequently the sample was extracted with 400 μl of cyclohexane and analyzed by gc ms the recovery ratio is over 79 details about chemical analysis and instrument method are provided in the supporting information acording to the method described by seidensticker et al seidensticker et al 2017 the following semi analytical model was used to fit the desorption curves 6 c p e t d p e 2 c p e 2 r 2 r c p e r 0 where dpe m2 s 1 r m and t s denote the diffusion coefficient in pe the radial coordinate and the time respectively cpe μg kg 1 is the concentration in the plastic sphere the mass flux through the external boundary layer must be identical

et al 2017 presented an analytical solution after laplace transformation in time and analyzed 3 cases of mass transfer control 1 by external mass transfer only that is in the limit of dpe eid 2 by intraparticle diffusion only that is in the limit of kw and 3 by both processes in sequence the analytical laplace transform solution of the bulk phase concentration is back transformed into the time domain by the numerical method of de hoog et al de hoog et al 1982 implemented in matlab we fit the model to the contaminant concentration data in the water in the above experiment 2 8 statistics all fits of the concentration response curves were plotted with origin 2017 and other figures were plotted with graphpad prism 7 0 one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s multiple comparison test or t test was used to determine the differences in cfree between different modified mps significance was set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of modified microplastics the surface morphology of the different modified microplastics was characterized by sem as shown in fig 1a a h it can be clearly found that the surface of the pristine microplastics mps is relatively smooth and after ageing by ultraviolet light the surface ripple structures deepen however a large number of cracks with a diameter of 1 μm or less are generated on the surface of the microspheres after chemical etching fig 1a g if the microplastics were etched and then aged under ultraviolet light the cracks are deepened and weathering and structural rupture can be observed the ftir spectrum of pristine mps matched the standard structure spectrum of polyethylene fig 1b one or more o containing absorption bands appeared in the other three modified mps according to a previous study lu et al 2018 the stretching band of emps at 3417 cm 1 can be attributed to o h stretching vibration the spectrum of uv mps shows a tensile vibration peak of carbonyl groups at 1725 cm 1 while that of uv emps shows the tensile vibration of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups compared with the pristine mps which contain almost no oxygen containing group absorption bands both the ultraviolet ageing and etching processes introduce oxygen containing functional groups the xps results in fig 1c show the energy spectra of the four samples the content of c and o in each sample was analyzed by the energy spectrum as shown in table 1 the pristine mps without surface treatment contain almost no oxygen while chemical etching and ultraviolet ageing can introduce oxygen functional groups on the surface of the mps it can be seen from the spectrum that o1s has three main peaks namely hydroxyl oh carbonyl co and alkoxy co labelled o1 o2 and o3 respectively the corresponding bond energies are 531 4 0 3 ev 532 8 0 3 ev and 533 4 0 3 ev by comparing the results for uv mps and uv emps it can be inferred that most of the groups added to the surface of mps during ultraviolet ageing are carbonyl groups which account for 76 and 80 respectively these results also confirm that the ultraviolet ageing and chemical etching process of mps leads to the introduction of polar functional groups on the surface of the mps thus improving the polarity of the mps the results of the nitrogen physical adsorption test in table 1 show that the surface area and pore volume of the mps increased slightly to 0 55 m2 g 1 after uv ageing however the surface area of the mps was significantly improved 1 67 m2 g 1 after chemical etching the surface area of uv emps 2 37 m2 g 1 is significantly five times higher than that of pristine mps and the pore volume 0 89 cm³ g 1 is increased by twice the pore surface area distribution shown in fig 2b a3 d3 indicates that the surfaces of the pristine mps have fewer pores and the surfaces of the mps after ultraviolet ageing have enlarged original pores in addition to an increased number of small pores chemical etching modification adds a large number of small holes interestingly comparing mps and uv mps as well as emps and uv emps it can be seen that the peak of the pore surface area distribution after uv irradiation is shifted that is pore expansion occurs the observed increase in the pore surface area and pore volume of pores smaller than 150 nm is critical to the change in mps adsorption capacity manovic et al 2012 it is foreseeable that micro plastics in the natural world that are worn or heavily etched on the surface will absorb more pollutants upon contact when the mps have been exposed to uv for a long time 3 2 etching and uv ageing mechanisms of microplastics there are several previous studies on the mechanism of chemical etching and uv light ageing of polyethylene plastics plastic surface treatment technology has been extensively studied since the 1970s many of the distinct properties of plastics including adhesion and wettability are achieved by introducing polar groups on the surface of the plastic and preparing a rough surface vasconcellos et al 1997 in our experiment the pristine mps were modified using chromic acid etching under milder experimental conditions table s2 and evidence of changes in the chemical composition of the mp surface has been provided in the characterization results according to the results of previous studies ben cheikh et al 2002 bentjen et al 1992 wiberg 1964 we know that the mechanism of the oxidation reaction between mps and chromic acid is that when mps are infiltrated in heated chromic acid solution the polyethylene molecular chains on the surface of the mps are attacked by the active hexavalent chromium therefore an intermediate of a tetravalent chromium ester is formed however in the reaction these intermediates are unstable and prone to hydrolysis to form alcohols in the polyethylene plastic polymer chain the position at which the hydroxyl group is introduced becomes weak a chain break occurs in the subsequent oxidation process and a ketone or an aldehyde is formed at the cleavage site and further oxidized to a carboxylic acid the ftir results of emps show some complex absorption bands between 1200 cm 1 and 1700 cm 1 which proves that during the chemical etching reaction some polar groups are introduced into the surface of the emps with the oxidation of the polymer the photochemical reaction caused by the absorption of uv radiation induces oxidation which makes the plastic brittle and the plastic surface is easily broken due to the reduced elasticity in previous studies feldman 2002 it has been revealed that the energy of ultraviolet light can produce enough free radical products to cause the c c bonds and c h bonds in polyethylene to separate from the polymer backbone this process occurs because the bond dissociation energy of the c c bond 375 kj mol 1 and the c h bond 420 kj mol 1 in polyethylene is equivalent to ultraviolet radiation of 320 and 290 nm respectively singh and sharma 2008 in a study by song et al 2017 the authors found that uv ageing of mps can cause one or more chemical changes including surface embrittlement which can cause surface cracks but this process does not cause overall polymer fragmentation 3 3 effect of different modified microplastics on the sorption kinetics of pahs on nd spme fibers in a study by heringa et al heringa and hermens 2003 it was found that the surface of pdms fibers was contaminated by the matrix and blocked the passage of pahs into and out of the fibers thus slowing the sorption rate of the contaminant to the fibers at the same time adhesion of the matrix to the surface of the fibers can also lead to an increase in the cfiber value during detection which will affect the accuracy of the experimental results fouling refers to attachment of matrix on the surface of the spme fibre and has been reported by poon poon et al 1999 and poerschmann et al 1997 and has been suggested in a review of ulrich ulrich 2000 liao et al even report the application of specially prepared polyacrylic acid coated fibres to extract proteins by adsorption to the coating surface liao et al 1996 in our experiment an envelope made of 200 mesh 74 μm stainless steel mesh was used to hold the pdms fiber as shown in fig s3 to prevent the adhesion of mps particles to the fiber and to facilitate experimental operation and sampling comparative test results show that the use of stainless steel mesh in the blank solution to hold pdms fibers does not affect the partition coefficient k f fig s1 a previous studies haftka et al 2013 ter laak et al 2006 have shown that the difference between the k f value determined using the mass balance method and the actual measured aqueous concentration is marginal and ph and salinity do not affect the logk f value of the neutral compound in the preliminary experiments the sorption isotherms of pahs to fibers were linear at two logarithmic units r2 0 995 as shown in fig s2 and the isotherms of the same substance measured in single and multiple solutes almost coincided there is no competitive sorption between pahs and fibers at the experimental concentration the sample depletion of 10 kinds of pah in the 1 l solution system was less than 5 of the total amount si table 2 and was negligible due to fiber sorption the logarithmic partition coefficient logk fiber of pahs measured between the spme fiber and water was consistent with the reported data heringa and hermens 2003 and correlated with the logk ow of the pahs logk fiber 0 6385logk ow 0 9456 r2 0 96 n 10 fig s1 b and table s2 the introduction of mps does not change the shape of the pah sorption curve compared to that of matrix free solution fig s5 the relationship between the uptake and elimination rate constants of various pahs versus logk ow is shown in fig 3 this diagram provides information on the rate limiting steps of different pahs in the exchange process between fibers and solutions for pahs with low hydrophobicity such as fluorene flu phenanthrene phe and anthracene ant k u increases linearly with increasing logk ow the rate limiting step of this kind of pah is diffusion in the pdms coating for other pahs with high hydrophobicity the k u value remains almost constant and does not change with increasing logk ow it is concluded that the rate limiting step of this kind of pah is diffusion in the aqueous phase around the fiber also known as the unstirred boundary layer ubl ter laak et al 2006 vaes et al 1996 the process of pah sorption to the fibers was not affected by the mps and the k u points of the different modified mps almost coincided the k u and k e values of different modified mps did not change significantly p 0 05 indicating that pah sorption kinetics to the fibers were not affected by mps modification this result was predictable because the nd spme fibers were protected by the stainless steel mesh pore size 75 μm which prevented fouling of the nd spme fibers by the mps 3 4 effect of modified microplastics on the cfree values and sorption coefficients of pahs the variation in the free fraction f of each pah in different modified mps is shown in fig 4 overall as the matrix concentration increases the f value of the pahs decreases as the mps concentration increases pahs in solution can combine with more mps resulting in a decrease in cfree the logk matrix values of pahs at different matrix concentrations calculated by eq 4 are listed in table s4 the matrix concentration only slightly influences the logk matrix values in previous studies hu et al 2014 pan et al 2008 when the concentration of matrix increases logk matrix decreases which is due to the restriction of molecular movement between matrix molecules and the reduction in the number of binding sites of pollutants on the matrix however in our present study it was found that logk matrix increased with increasing mps concentration especially for pahs with higher hydrophobicity logk ow 5 91 6 20 for the less hydrophobic pahs logk ow 4 18 4 63 the main mode of action with rubbery polyethylene mps was partitioning at experimental pah concentrations 1 μg l 1 for the more hydrophobic pahs logk ow 5 16 6 20 in addition to partitioning adsorption participates the average logk matrix value logk matrixfit can also be obtained by linear fitting to eq 5 the fitting curve of most pahs is good r2 0 92 indicating that the interaction between pahs and polyethylene mps is mainly based on partitioning which is consistent with previous studies fries and zarfl 2012 teuten et al 2007 the fitted curves of the effects of modified mps on the cfree of pahs are shown in fig 4 the extent of the influence of mps modification on the free fraction f depends on the hydrophobicity of the pahs for the less hydrophobic pahs logk ow 4 18 4 63 the curves of the different modified mps almost coincided for the more hydrophobic pahs logk ow 5 16 6 20 the effect of the etch modified mps emps and uv emps on the decrease in f is clear according to the results of the group t test and analysis of variance there was no significant difference in the value of f between pristine mps and uv mps for pahs p 0 05 there was a significant difference p 0 05 in the decrease in the f value between pristine mps and emps or uv emps for pahs with higher hydrophobicity according to a previous study kamlet et al 1988 the π polarization ability and hydrogen bond acceptance ability of pahs are positively correlated with the number of aromatic rings in their molecular structure therefore the hydrogen bonding and π π interaction between pahs and mps become increasingly obvious as the number of aromatic rings increases as a result the f mps concentration curves of tricyclic pahs in different modified mps almost coincide and with an increased number of aromatic rings the f mps concentration curves in different modified mps become increasingly deviated the modified mps showed a higher surface oxygen content than the pristine mps which made the modified mps combine with more pahs through hydrogen bonding and π π interactions thus resulting in the most obvious decrease in f for pahs with four or five aromatic rings the effect of different modified mps on the logk matrixfit value is shown in fig 5 the logk matrixfit values for pristine mps uv mps emps and uv emps increase with increasing pah logk ow linear regression analysis between logk matrixfit and logk ow shows good linearity r2 0 78 to 0 92 logk mps 0 3951 logk ow 2 498 r2 0 78 logkuv mps 0 4355 logk ow 2 269 r2 0 80 logk emps 0 5049 logk ow 2 065 r2 0 87 and logk uv emps 0 5538 logk ow 1 853 r2 0 92 it can be concluded that the interaction of pahs with various modified mps depends on the hydrophobicity of the pah for the less hydrophobic pahs logk ow 4 18 4 63 mps modification only slightly influences the logk matrixfit values logk mps 3 80 4 53 logk uv mps 3 71 4 59 logk emps 3 85 4 59 logk uv emps 3 90 4 56 and one way anova shows no significant difference between the logk matrixfit values of the different modified mps p 0 05 however for the more hydrophobic pahs logk ow 5 91 6 20 there was a significant difference in the logk matrixfit value between different etched modified mps logk emps 4 69 5 18 logk uv emps 4 72 5 28 and the pristine mps logk mps 4 56 4 95 p 0 05 although the logk matrixfit value of pahs to all mps is positively correlated with logk ow the logk matrixfit values of emps and uv emps are more pronounced although the logk matrixfit values of the uv mps and pristine mps were still not significantly different the logk matrixfit values of uv mps were slightly higher than those of the pristine mps the reason for this result is that the modification of the mps in the experiment whether by etching or ultraviolet irradiation mainly changes the structure of the surface as shown in fig 1 the modification and balance experiments were carried out at 25 65 c which is higher than the glass transition temperature tg of polyethylene and does not change the rubber structure of polyethylene mps according to the results of xps characterization the surface oxygen content of the three modified mps was improved as shown in table 1 the presence of these oxygen containing functional groups alters the facial chemistry of the modified mps thereby altering the adsorption behaviour of the hocs on the mps in the study of carbon nanotubes by gotovac et al 2007 it was found that electron withdrawing groups on the surface of oxidized carbon nanotubes can enhance the π π effect between phenanthrene and carbon nanotubes thereby enhancing the adsorption amount of phenanthrene on the carbon nanotubes this behaviour explains why there is only a difference in surface oxygen content between the pristine mps and uv mps but the uv mps have a slightly higher sorption capacity for highly hydrophobic pahs than mps this is because the oxygen containing groups introduced on the surface of the pristine mps by ultraviolet irradiation can be regarded as electron donating groups which enhance the π electron density of the surface of the mps j y chen et al 2008a w chen et al 2008b the more hydrophobic pahs have a more planar structure so π π effects become more obvious as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the surface of the mps changed greatly after etching compared to the pristine mps the surface area of the emps increased by 3 4 times while the average pore diameter became 8 66 nm the surface change in the uv emps is the most intense compared to the pristine mps the surface area of the uv emps is increased by 4 8 times while the average pore diameter became 7 37 nm the emps and uv emps have larger specific surfaces and an increased small pore structure diameter 10 nm so it is not surprising that the modified mps combine with more freely dissolved pahs this explains why emps and uv emps can significantly reduce the f value of higher hydrophobic pahs in solution 3 5 sorption isotherms and desorption kinetics of phenanthrene on modified microplastics in the above nd spme study we only measured the change in pah cfree value in the solution after the balance between microplastics and contaminants and the sorption mechanisms of pahs on different modified mps were obtained via indirect derivation also the desorption process of pahs from different modified microplastics cannot be obtained by the nd spme method therefore in this part we used phenanthrene as a model pah to study directly the sorption isotherms and desorption kinetics of pah to different modified microplastics the isothermal sorption line of the emps and uv emps gradually changes from linear to nonlinear in fig s8 and table s5 because the pores of the surface of pristine mps and uv mps are negligible for emps and uv emps the modification results in a large number of pores being introduced the freundlich model is better at describing the sorption of phenanthrene in emps and uv emps such results are also foreseeable as the increase in pores shifts the isotherm toward nonlinear sorption allen king et al 2002 kleineidam et al 2002 this result verified what we concluded by the nd spme method that the sorption of pahs on mps is mainly based on partitioning however a mechanism of adsorption also likely takes place in emps and uv emps due to pore sorption we use the semi analytical model described by seidensticker et al to describe the kinetic mass transfer between aqueous solutions of organic contaminants and spherical particles of polyethylene seidensticker et al 2017 this model is a good explanation for the dominant mechanism in the desorption process of pahs from different modified microplastics fig 6 shows the measured concentration time series and the model results of the fitted complete model blue solid lines considering only the model prediction of the external mass transfer using the full model parameters red dashed line and considering only the intraparticle diffusion table s5 contains the estimated values of the mass transfer coefficients and the intraparticle diffusion coefficient as well as the ranges of their 5 95 quantiles fig 6 shows the excellent agreement between the phenanthrene desorption experiment results and the simulation results in the initial stage of desorption this part of the experimental data is lacking due to the difficulty of experimental sampling and instrumental analysis conditions for all pe microplastics early models at the beginning of desorption showed that external mass transfer always controlled overall mass transfer when approaching equilibrium intraparticle diffusion becomes the rate limiting step especially for the etch modified microplastics it is more obvious that it is more affected by the intraparticle diffusion at a later stage because the etch modification of microplastics produced a large number of small holes in the surface of emps and uv emps as table 1 and fig 2 show therefore the intraparticle diffusion coefficient obtained by the model fitting is smaller than that of the unmodified microplastic in the study by sven seidensticker et al it has been shown that as the particle size increases the probability of long range transport of pollutants increases and as the diffusion coefficient within the particles increases the probability of long range transport of pollutants decreases seidensticker et al 2019 our results show that the desorption kinetics of the modified polyethylene microplastics is still dominated by film diffusion however the etching modification increases a large number of small pores so that the intraparticle diffusion coefficient of the microplastic particles is reduced and the isotherms are linearly shifted to nonlinear ultimately these modified microplastics will have improved long range transport capabilities for contaminants however koelmans et al have also discussed that microplastic materials do not significantly increase the concentration of contaminants koelmans et al 2016 but it is important for our study to compare the ability of microplastics to carry contaminants before and after modification 4 conclusions mps modified by artificial weathering and ultraviolet ageing were simulated in the laboratory it was found that modified mps especially those modified by etching and etching followed by uv exhibit distinct characteristics from pristine mps thus the effects of various modified mps on hoc availability vary under the simulated conditions the polyethylene plastics are still rubber polymers so the interaction between polyethylene plastics and hydrophobic organic pollutants is mainly partitioning however in the process of artificial weathering etching the specific surface area of the mps substantially increases and a large number of small pore structures are introduced to increase adsorption by mps with large molecular weight and strong hydrophobicity that is the ability of different modified mps to carry hydrophobic organic pollutants increases which is very important for studying the toxicity of mps in conjunction with hydrophobic organic pollutants in the actual environment desorption study indicated that pah desorption from mps are dominated by film diffusion however the intraparticle diffusion process also takes great part for the mps with the etching modification due to increase of small pores ultimately these modified microplastics will have improved long range transport capabilities for contaminants declaration of competing interest the

18262,microplastics mps discharged into the natural environment undergo various wearthering pathways such as mechanical abrasion and ultraviolet uv irradiation however little is known about the effects of such aged mps on the bioavailability of hydrophobic organic compounds hocs in aqueous environments to simulate the natural oxidation and uv ageing process of mps three kinds of modified polyethylene mps were obtained by plastic etching processes common in industry and uv irradiation namely etched mps emps uv aged mps uv mps and etched mps followed by uv ageing uv emps the modified mps showed a higher content of surface oxygen containing groups than the pristine mps and the specific surface area and pore volume increased significantly after etching and ultraviolet ageing especially for the emps 1 67 m2 g 1 and 0 0049 cm³ g 1 and uv emps 2 37 m2 g 1 and 0 0089 cm³ g 1 the effect of modified mps on the availability of 10 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs logk ow 4 18 6 20 was evaluated by negligible depletion solid phase microextraction nd spme the free concentrations cfree of most pahs except for less hydrophobic pahs logk ow 4 18 and 4 56 decreased with an increasing concentration of mps the logarithms of the sorption coefficients of pahs with various mps logk mps logk uv mps logk emps and logk uv emps were linearly correlated with logk ow suggesting that the sorption is hydrophobicity dependent compared with the results for pristine mps logk mp 3 80 4 95 uv ageing only slightly enhanced the sorption of pahs by mps logk uv mps 3 71 4 98 whereas the plastic etching processes significantly enhanced sorption logk emps 3 85 5 18 and logk uv emps 3 90 5 28 the sorption of pahs to mps is mainly based on partitioning however a mechanism of adsorption also likely takes place in emps and uv emps due to hydrogen bonding and π π interactions desorption study indicated that pah desorption from mps are dominated by film diffusion however intraparticle diffusion also takes great part for the emps these results suggest that modification of mps in the natural environment will change the availability of hocs graphical abstract image 1

according to their sources and petroleum derived polymers and can be subdivided into polyethylene polystyrene and other types of plastics depending on the polymerized monomers rochman et al 2013a rostkowski et al 2012 plastics are widely used in commercial and construction materials for their superior performance alimi et al 2018 andrady and neal 2009 however the production and recycling of plastics are seriously imbalanced only approximately one quarter or less of plastics are eventually recycled or disposed properly a large amount of plastic waste to be released into the environment due to the mismanagement of waste nizzetto et al 2016 o connor et al 2016 it is foreseeable that these plastics will be affected by many natural factors including hydrolysis photodegradation due to ultraviolet uv irradiation exposure mechanical abrasion and biodegradation alimi et al 2018 browne et al 2011 imhof et al 2012 these mps ultimately will find their way into the aqueous environment and thus likely cause environmental and health concerns due to their potential toxicity boerger et al 2010 rochman et al 2013a wegner et al 2012 mps may interact with pollutants in the aqueous environment it has been reported that mps in the aquatic environment combine with persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals holmes et al 2012 rochman et al 2013b and the concentration of pollutants in mps may even be 105 to 106 times higher than that in ambient seawater rios et al 2010 ziccardi et al 2016 because these contaminated mps may have a special trojan horse effect on organisms the interaction of mps with pollutants is increasingly being studied to better understand the risks of plastics in the environment mato et al 2001 rochman 2015 plastic products that are discharged into nature will be broken down into smaller pieces of plastic under the influence of physical chemical and biological processes auta et al 2017 romera castillo et al 2018 surface changes occur in the process of the fragmentation of mps including the peeling off of plastic surface coatings the formation of pore and changes in the mechanical strength oxygen content and molecular weight of mps gardette et al 2013 lv et al 2017 in these processes mechanical wear and photochemical degradation are considered important processes for the ageing of hydrocarbon polymers andrady 2015 gewert et al 2015 it is believed that beaches are the most favourable environment for weathering and breaking of plastics song et al 2017 ultraviolet ageing of mps involves ultraviolet absorption by photosensitive groups formation of polymer radicals oxidation reactions and so on gewert et al 2015 singh and sharma 2008 to date the mechanism of polymer degradation has been extensively studied under different environmental conditions and in simulation experiments gardette et al 2013 gewert et al 2015 p liu et al 2019b recent studies browne et al 2013 chua et al 2014 have shown that common additives in plastics such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers can be transferred to the intestinal tissues of living organisms and inhibit the feeding activity of organisms several studies have explained the interaction mechanism between uv aged mps and organic pollutants huffer and hofmann 2016 huffer et al 2018 g z liu et al 2019a however there are few studies on the influence of aged mps on the bioavailability of organic pollutants in aqueous environments and the mechanism is still unclear since the freely dissolved concentration cfree of pollutants is the driving force for the migration distribution and bioaccumulation of pollutants in the environment cfree is the most direct parameter reflecting the bioavailability of pollutants ramos et al 1998 reichenberg and mayer 2006 investigating the effect of modified mps on the availability cfree of organic pollutants will help reveal the mechanisms of bioaccumulation and biological effects of the coexistence of organic pollutants with mps in the aqueous environment research has shown that advanced oxidation processes aops are an alternative to natural ageing of mps p liu et al 2019b it is possible to shorten the ageing time required in the natural process and to help obtain modified plastics by artificially controlling the reaction conditions therefore we used a common plastic modification technology in industry chromic acid etching for plastic surface oxidation treatment ben cheikh et al 2002 bentjen et al 1992 polyethylene plastic pellets are often detected in marine and freshwater environments mintenig et al 2017 these materials have a stronger sorption capacity for environmental pollutants than other types of plastics wang et al 2018 in this study using polyethylene pe as a model mps the ageing process and mechanisms of mps modified by chromic acid etching combined with uv irradiation were investigated furthermore an equilibrium passive sampling technique negligible depletion solid phase microextraction nd spme was used to evaluate the effect of various modified mps on the availability cfree of hydrophobic organic pollutants in the aqueous environment the pdms is a viscous liquid at room temperature through which compounds can quickly diffuse gorecki et al 1999 the diffusion of contaminants from water into fibers is a passive process driven by the difference in chemical fugacities on both sides of the interface based on the theory of distribution leslie et al 2002 during the nd spme process the fibres extract only a negligible freely dissolved portion of the analyte and do not disturb the equilibrium between the freely dissolved state of the analyte and the mps bound state the conditions for correct application of nd spme are 1 there is equilibrium between the bound and free and gaseous fraction of analyte 2 the depletion of the free fraction by the extraction is negligible 3 the binding matrix does not affect the extraction heringa and hermens 2003 in our previous study hu et al 2014 the cfree value of hydrophobic organic pollutants in fullerene aqueous suspensions was determined by the nd spme method and the availability was evaluated therefore it is feasible to apply nd spme to evaluate the effect of modified mps on the availability of hydrophobic organic pollutants in aqueous solution 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials clear high density polyethylene

particle emps preparation pristine mps were washed three times with deionized water and dried in a 40 с oven for 48 h before sample preparation to ensure that the particles were dry and clean a total of 150 ml of chromic acid was added to a glass beaker and incubated in a 65 c water bath a total of 25 mg of pristine mps was added to 65 c of chromic acid for 15 min during this process the reaction solution was continuously stirred with a glass rod to bring the mp into full contact with chromic acid after the reaction was completed the etched microplastics emps were washed and recovered the preparation of the reaction solution the experimental operation and the specific recovery process are detailed in the supporting information ultraviolet aged microplastic particle preparation the pristine mps and emps were placed into glass petri dishes and spread microplastics evenly in a petri dish for uv exposure fig s7 the particles were tiled to be achieve even dispersal in the glass petri dishes the dishes were then transferred to a dark box containing ultraviolet light bulbs 4 15 w uvc bulbs ɣmax 254 nm and exposed to ultraviolet light for 30 days the samples were shaken horizontally every 3 days to ensure uniform exposure two kinds of uv aged microplastic particles uv mps ultraviolet aged pristine mps and uv emps etched microplastic particles followed by ultraviolet ageing were thus obtained 2 3 structural characterization sem a scanning electron microscope fei nova nano sem was used to observe the effect of modification on the surface morphology of the mps a small sample was directly adhered to a double coated carbon conductive tab on a stub then the stub was coated with au for 60 s to enhance the sample conductivity prior to sem observation at 5 kv the results are shown in fig 1 a and fig 2 a ftir fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy was used to record changes in the functional groups of the mps before and after modification briefly the samples were dried and mixed with kbr at a ratio of 0 5 mg sample 100 mg kbr thoroughly ground and pressed into tablets then the ftir spectra were recorded using a nicolet 6700 spectrometer in the 400 4000 cm 1 region with a resolution of 1 cm 1 the air background spectrum especially carbon dioxide interference was subtracted from all samples and interferograms were collected the corresponding spectra are shown in fig 1b xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi characterization was performed to measure the change in elemental composition of the surface of the mp samples before and after modification a summary of the scanned results is shown in fig 1c the o 1s spectra of the emps uv mps and uv emps samples were recorded at 532 92 ev with a scanning step of 0 05 ev as shown in fig s3 bet n 2 the surface area the pore volume and the average pore size of the different mps were determined using gas n2 adsorption desorption with a micromeritics asap 2460 analyzer system using the brunauer emmett teller bet equation in brief 250 mg of mps was degassed for 24 h at 330 k we consider that the microplastic used in the experiment is hdpe with high temperature resistance after cooling to room temperature n2 sorption desorption analysis started at a liquid n2 temperature of 77 k the surface area was determined by the bet method using seven data sorption points between relative pressures of 0 05 and 0 3 based on monolayer adsorption theory the pore distribution was calculated from all desorption data points according to the barrett joyner halenda bjh method data are presented in fig 2b and table 1 2 4 nd spme procedure the nd spme fibres were cut to a length of 1 cm before the fibres were immersed in pure acetone for 2 h to wash away the contaminated impurities after that the acetone was filtered off to allow the fibres to dry naturally and the clean fibres were placed in 200 mesh 74 μm stainless steel mesh for subsequent testing for the commercial pdms fibers used in our experiments the pdms coating thickness was 30 μm which corresponds to 0 132 μl of pdms per cm of fiber 2 5 pah uptake kinetics in nd spme fibers and particle types influence transfer 1000 ml of 10 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 to an amber glass vial 1000 ml the diluted pahs were added to each bottle to obtain a working solution having a respective pah concentration of 0 5 10 μg l 1 table s1 in the support information 5 mg of different types of particles such as pristine plastics mps emps uv mps and uv emps were added to different amber glass bottles the solid to liquid ratio of microplastics to solution of 5 10 6 kg l 1 to prevent bacterial growth and minimize pah degradation 0 1 mm nan3 was added to the solution in order to fully contact the microplastics with the solvent to achieve pre equilibration of the microplastics and pahs we placed the amber glasses in a 25 c 200 rpm shaker for 7 days after the 7 days pre equilibration we placed the previously prepared stainless steel mesh with nd spme fibers in each amber glass bottle two fibers placed in each bottle represent two repetitions and the bottles were placed back into the 25 c 200 rpm shaker each bottle represents a point in time and a time curve consists of 10 time sample points so a minimum of 10 amber bottles are required to complete a time curve completion of all microplastic evaluations including blank reference requires a minimum of 50 bottles the fibers collected at 0 3 6 12 24 48 72 120 144 and 168 h respectively were used to determine the pah concentration on the fibers during the sampling process the fibers in the stainless steel mesh were transferred to a clean wet filter paper to remove water droplets attached to the surface of the fibers the fibers were then placed in a sample vial and desorbed with 100 μl of methanol for 24 h after that the analytical solution was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography hplc the specific experimental setup is described in detail in fig s3 1 c f i b e r v m e t h o l c m e t h o l v f i b e r 100 c m e t h o l 0 132 for equation 1 vmethol is the volume of desorbed methanol which is 100 μl vfiber is the volume of pdms on

investigate the effects of different modified mps on the availability or cfree of pahs four batches of matrices including mps emps uv mps and uv emps were compared in each batch the matrix concentrations were set as 0 1 2 5 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 ph 7 0 the pre equilibration of the microplastics with the pahs was carried out for 7 days in a shaker after the 7 day pre equilibration the spme fibers were placed in the bottles then continue to shake in the shaker for 7 days the subsequent sampling and determination process is consistent with the previous description the pah sorption coefficient between the matrix and aqueous solution k matrix at each matrix concentration was calculated from eq 4 which was modified from escher et al 2002 4 k m a t r i x c m a t r i x c f r e e c f

the matrix cfiber mg l 1 is the pah concentration on the fiber and matrix kg l 1 refers to the mass concentration of mps emps uv mps or uv emps in the solution assuming the sorption of a chemical to the mps agreed with a linear partitioning model the free fraction f defined as the ratio between the mps cfree and reference solution cfree ref at different mps concentrations can be fitted to eq 5 hu

matrix in the entire studied concentration range the k matrixfit value is reported in the present study 2 7 sorption and desorption experiment of phenanthrene on microplastics to explain the sorption and desorption mechanisms of pahs on different modified mps we choose phenanthrene as a model pah to conduct the sorption and desorption experiment according to the method described by seidensticker et al seidensticker et al 2017 details about the sorption experiment are shown in the supplementary materials 2 g of different modified polyethylene beads were added to various 200 ml of methanol water 20 80 v v solution in brown bottles spiked with 90 μg of phenanthrene the solution was shaking at a 20 c 150 rpm shaker for 96 h to preload phenanthrene on mps then the microplastic particles were collected and were shaken with a 100 μm sieve and rinsed three times with ultrapure water to prevent the phenanthrene fouling on the mps surface during the drying process the microplastic particles were recovered and dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen fig s10 subsequently samples were extracted with cyclohexane to determine the amount of phenanthrene the concentration of phenanthrene in the plastic is mps 46 2 2 4 uv mps 46 5 2 1 emps 79 8 1 9 and uv emps 82 1 1 5 μg g 1 the experiments were performed with a 500 ml ultrapure water and 500 mg of phenanthrene preloaded microplastics in 1 l amber glass bottle which led to a solid to liquid ratio of 10 3 kg l 1 to avoid biodegradation and photooxidation we added 0 05 g l 1 nan3 and kept the bottle in the dark the bottles were continuously shaken at a speed of 150 rpm on a horizontal shaker and the temperature inside the warm shaker was set to 20 1 ml aqueous samples were collected at 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min 40 min 1 h 2 h 4 h 8 h 24 h 48 h 72 h 96 h 120 h 144 h 196 h and 250 h and 10 μl of deuterated internal standard was added to the samples subsequently the sample was extracted with 400 μl of cyclohexane and analyzed by gc ms the recovery ratio is over 79 details about chemical analysis and instrument method are provided in the supporting information acording to the method described by seidensticker et al seidensticker et al 2017 the following semi analytical model was used to fit the desorption curves 6 c p e t d p e 2 c p e 2 r 2 r c p e r 0 where dpe m2 s 1 r m and t s denote the diffusion coefficient in pe the radial coordinate and the time respectively cpe μg kg 1 is the concentration in the plastic sphere the mass flux through the external boundary layer must be identical to the internal mass flux at the particle surface 7 j c w c p e r p k p e w k w d p e ρ p e c p e r r p in which j μg ml 1 s 1 and kw m s 1 are the mass flux density and the aqueous mass transfer coefficient respectively cw μg l 1 denotes the concentration in the bulk solution rp is the radius of the spherical particle and ρpe kg l 1 denotes its mass density in a finite bath the concentration in the bulk phase changes according to the total mass flux across the area of all particles leading to the following balance equation 8 d c w d t c p e r p k p e w c w k w 3 m p r p ρ p e v w which is subject to a known initial concentration cw 0 where mp kg and vw l denote the mass of the particles and the volume of water respectively no mass is stored in the aqueous boundary layer seidensticker et al 2017 presented an analytical solution after laplace transformation in time and analyzed 3 cases of mass transfer control 1 by external mass transfer only that is in the limit of dpe eid 2 by intraparticle diffusion only that is in the limit of kw and 3 by both processes in sequence the analytical laplace transform solution of the bulk phase concentration is back transformed into the time domain by the numerical method of de hoog et al de hoog et al 1982 implemented in matlab we fit the model to the contaminant concentration data in the water in the above experiment 2 8 statistics all fits of the concentration response curves were plotted with origin 2017 and other figures were plotted with graphpad prism 7 0 one way analysis of variance anova followed by tukey s multiple comparison test or t test was used to determine the differences in cfree between different modified mps significance was set at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of modified microplastics the surface morphology of the different modified microplastics was characterized by sem as shown in fig 1a a h it can be clearly found that the surface of the pristine microplastics mps is relatively smooth and after ageing by ultraviolet light the surface ripple structures deepen however a large number of cracks with a diameter of 1 μm or less are generated on the surface of the microspheres after chemical etching fig 1a g if the microplastics were etched and then aged under ultraviolet light the cracks are deepened and weathering and structural rupture can be observed the ftir spectrum of pristine mps matched the standard structure spectrum of polyethylene fig 1b one or more o containing absorption bands appeared in the other three modified mps according to a previous study lu et al 2018 the stretching band of emps at 3417 cm 1 can be attributed to o h stretching vibration the spectrum of uv mps shows a tensile vibration peak of carbonyl groups at 1725 cm 1 while that of uv emps shows the tensile vibration of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups compared with the pristine mps which contain almost no oxygen containing group absorption bands both the ultraviolet ageing and etching processes introduce oxygen containing functional groups the xps results in fig 1c show the energy spectra of the four samples the content of c and o in each sample was analyzed by the energy spectrum as shown in table 1 the pristine mps without surface treatment contain almost no oxygen while chemical etching and ultraviolet ageing can introduce oxygen functional groups on the surface of the mps it can be seen from the spectrum that o1s has three main peaks namely hydroxyl oh carbonyl co and alkoxy co labelled o1 o2 and o3 respectively the corresponding bond energies are 531 4 0 3 ev 532 8 0 3 ev and 533 4 0 3 ev by comparing the results for uv mps and uv emps it can be inferred that most of the groups added to the surface of mps during ultraviolet ageing are carbonyl groups which account for 76 and 80 respectively these results also confirm that the ultraviolet ageing and chemical etching process of mps leads to the introduction of polar functional groups on the surface of the mps thus improving the polarity of the mps the results of the nitrogen physical adsorption test in table 1 show that the surface area and pore volume of the mps increased slightly to 0 55 m2 g 1 after uv ageing however the surface area of the mps was significantly improved 1 67 m2 g 1 after chemical etching the surface area of uv emps 2 37 m2 g 1 is significantly five times higher than that of pristine mps and the pore volume 0 89 cm³ g 1 is increased by twice the pore surface area distribution shown in fig 2b a3 d3 indicates that the surfaces of the pristine mps have fewer pores and the surfaces of the mps after ultraviolet ageing have enlarged original pores in addition to an increased number of small pores chemical etching modification adds a large number of small holes interestingly comparing mps and uv mps as well as emps and uv emps it can be seen that the peak of the pore surface area distribution after uv irradiation is shifted that is pore expansion occurs the observed increase in the pore surface area and pore volume of pores smaller than 150 nm is critical to the change in mps adsorption capacity manovic et al 2012 it is foreseeable that micro plastics in the natural world that are worn or heavily etched on the surface will absorb more pollutants upon contact when the mps have been exposed to uv for a long time 3 2 etching and uv ageing mechanisms of microplastics there are several previous studies on the mechanism of chemical etching and uv light ageing of polyethylene plastics plastic surface treatment technology has been extensively studied since the 1970s many of the distinct properties of plastics including adhesion and wettability are achieved by introducing polar groups on the surface of the plastic and preparing a rough surface vasconcellos et al 1997 in our experiment the pristine mps were modified using chromic acid etching under milder experimental conditions table s2 and evidence of changes in the chemical composition of the mp surface has been provided in the characterization results according to the results of previous studies ben cheikh et al 2002 bentjen et al 1992 wiberg 1964 we know that the mechanism of the oxidation reaction between mps and chromic acid is that when mps are infiltrated in heated chromic acid solution the polyethylene molecular chains on the surface of the mps are attacked by the active hexavalent chromium therefore an intermediate of a tetravalent chromium ester is formed however in the reaction these intermediates are unstable and prone to hydrolysis to form alcohols in the polyethylene plastic polymer chain the position at which the hydroxyl group is introduced becomes weak a chain break occurs in the subsequent oxidation process and a ketone or an aldehyde is formed at the cleavage site and further oxidized to a carboxylic acid the ftir results of emps show some complex absorption bands between 1200 cm 1 and 1700 cm 1 which proves that during the chemical etching reaction some polar groups are introduced into the surface of the emps with the oxidation of the polymer the photochemical reaction caused by the absorption of uv radiation induces oxidation which makes the plastic brittle and the plastic surface is easily broken due to the reduced elasticity in previous studies feldman 2002 it has been revealed that the energy of ultraviolet light can produce enough free radical products to cause the c c bonds and c h bonds in polyethylene to separate from the polymer backbone this process occurs because the bond dissociation energy of the c c bond 375 kj mol 1 and the c h bond 420 kj mol 1 in polyethylene is equivalent to ultraviolet radiation of 320 and 290 nm respectively singh and sharma 2008 in a study by song et al 2017 the authors found that uv ageing of mps can cause one or more chemical changes including surface embrittlement which can cause surface cracks but this process does not cause overall polymer fragmentation 3 3 effect of different modified microplastics on the sorption kinetics of pahs on nd spme fibers in a study by heringa et al heringa and hermens 2003 it was found that the surface of pdms fibers was contaminated by the matrix and blocked the passage of pahs into and out of the fibers thus slowing the sorption rate of the contaminant to the fibers at the same time adhesion of the matrix to the surface of the fibers can also lead to an increase in the cfiber value during detection which will affect the accuracy of the experimental results fouling refers to attachment of matrix on the surface of the spme fibre and has been reported by poon poon et al 1999 and poerschmann et al 1997 and has been suggested in a review of ulrich ulrich 2000 liao et al even report the application of specially prepared polyacrylic acid coated fibres to extract proteins by adsorption to the coating surface liao et al 1996 in our experiment an envelope made of 200 mesh 74 μm stainless steel mesh was used to hold the pdms fiber as shown in fig s3 to prevent the adhesion of mps particles to the fiber and to facilitate experimental operation and sampling comparative test results show that the use of stainless steel mesh in the blank solution to hold pdms fibers does not affect the partition coefficient k f fig s1 a previous studies haftka et al 2013 ter laak et al 2006 have shown that the difference between the k f value determined using the mass balance method and the actual measured aqueous concentration is marginal and ph and salinity do not affect the logk f value of the neutral compound in the preliminary experiments the sorption isotherms of pahs to fibers were linear at two logarithmic units r2 0 995 as shown in fig s2 and the isotherms of the same substance measured in single and multiple solutes almost coincided there is no competitive sorption between pahs and fibers at the experimental concentration the sample depletion of 10 kinds of pah in the 1 l solution system was less than 5 of the total amount si table 2 and was negligible due to fiber sorption the logarithmic partition coefficient logk fiber of pahs measured between the spme fiber and water was consistent with the reported data heringa and hermens 2003 and correlated with the logk ow of the pahs logk fiber 0 6385logk ow 0 9456 r2 0 96 n 10 fig s1 b and table s2 the introduction of mps does not change the shape of the pah sorption curve compared to that of matrix free solution fig s5 the relationship between the uptake and elimination rate constants of various pahs versus logk ow is shown in fig 3 this diagram provides information on the rate limiting steps of different pahs in the exchange process between fibers and solutions for pahs with low hydrophobicity such as fluorene flu phenanthrene phe and anthracene ant k u increases linearly with increasing logk ow the rate limiting step of this kind of pah is diffusion in the pdms coating for other pahs with high hydrophobicity the k u value remains almost constant and does not change with increasing logk ow it is concluded that the rate limiting step of this kind of pah is diffusion in the aqueous phase around the fiber also known as the unstirred boundary layer ubl ter laak et al 2006 vaes et al 1996 the process of pah sorption to the fibers was not affected by the mps and the k u points of the different modified mps almost coincided the k u and k e values of different modified mps did not change significantly p 0 05 indicating that pah sorption kinetics to the fibers were not affected by mps modification this result was predictable because the nd spme fibers were protected by the stainless steel mesh pore size 75 μm which prevented fouling of the nd spme fibers by the mps 3 4 effect of modified microplastics on the cfree values and sorption coefficients of pahs the variation in the free fraction f of each pah in different modified mps is shown in fig 4 overall as the matrix concentration increases the f value of the pahs decreases as the mps concentration increases pahs in solution can combine with more mps resulting in a decrease in cfree the logk matrix values of pahs at different matrix concentrations calculated by eq 4 are listed in table s4 the matrix concentration only slightly influences the logk matrix values in previous studies hu et al 2014 pan et al 2008 when the concentration of matrix increases logk matrix decreases which is due to the restriction of molecular movement between matrix molecules and the reduction in the number of binding sites of pollutants on the matrix however in our present study it was found that logk matrix increased with increasing mps concentration especially for pahs with higher hydrophobicity logk ow 5 91 6 20 for the less hydrophobic pahs logk ow 4 18 4 63 the main mode of action with rubbery polyethylene mps was partitioning at experimental pah concentrations 1 μg l 1 for the more hydrophobic pahs logk ow 5 16 6 20 in addition to partitioning adsorption participates the average logk matrix value logk matrixfit can also be obtained by linear fitting to eq 5 the fitting curve of most pahs is good r2 0 92 indicating that the interaction between pahs and polyethylene mps is mainly based on partitioning which is consistent with previous studies fries and zarfl 2012 teuten et al 2007 the fitted curves of the effects of modified mps on the cfree of pahs are shown in fig 4 the extent of the influence of mps modification on the free fraction f depends on the hydrophobicity of the pahs for the less hydrophobic pahs logk ow 4 18 4 63 the curves of the different modified mps almost coincided for the more hydrophobic pahs logk ow 5 16 6 20 the effect of the etch modified mps emps and uv emps on the decrease in f is clear according to the results of the group t test and analysis of variance there was no significant difference in the value of f between pristine mps and uv mps for pahs p 0 05 there was a significant difference p 0 05 in the decrease in the f value between pristine mps and emps or uv emps for pahs with higher hydrophobicity according to a previous study kamlet et al 1988 the π polarization ability and hydrogen bond acceptance ability of pahs are positively correlated with the number of aromatic rings in their molecular structure therefore the hydrogen bonding and π π interaction between pahs and mps become increasingly obvious as the number of aromatic rings increases as a result the f mps concentration curves of tricyclic pahs in different modified mps almost coincide and with an increased number of aromatic rings the f mps concentration curves in different modified mps become increasingly deviated the modified mps showed a higher surface oxygen content than the pristine mps which made the modified mps combine with more pahs through hydrogen bonding and π π interactions thus resulting in the most obvious decrease in f for pahs with four or five aromatic rings the effect of different modified mps on the logk matrixfit value is shown in fig 5 the logk matrixfit values for pristine mps uv mps emps and uv emps increase with increasing pah logk ow linear regression analysis between logk matrixfit and logk ow shows good linearity r2 0 78 to 0 92 logk mps 0 3951 logk ow 2 498 r2 0 78 logkuv mps 0 4355 logk ow 2 269 r2 0 80 logk emps 0 5049 logk ow 2 065 r2 0 87 and logk uv emps 0 5538 logk ow 1 853 r2 0 92 it can be concluded that the interaction of pahs with various modified mps depends on the hydrophobicity of the pah for the less hydrophobic pahs logk ow 4 18 4 63 mps modification only slightly influences the logk matrixfit values logk mps 3 80 4 53 logk uv mps 3 71 4 59 logk emps 3 85 4 59 logk uv emps 3 90 4 56 and one way anova shows no significant difference between the logk matrixfit values of the different modified mps p 0 05 however for the more hydrophobic pahs logk ow 5 91 6 20 there was a significant difference in the logk matrixfit value between different etched modified mps logk emps 4 69 5 18 logk uv emps 4 72 5 28 and the pristine mps logk mps 4 56 4 95 p 0 05 although the logk matrixfit value of pahs to all mps is positively correlated with logk ow the logk matrixfit values of emps and uv emps are more pronounced although the logk matrixfit values of the uv mps and pristine mps were still not significantly different the logk matrixfit values of uv mps were slightly higher than those of the pristine mps the reason for this result is that the modification of the mps in the experiment whether by etching or ultraviolet irradiation mainly changes the structure of the surface as shown in fig 1 the modification and balance experiments were carried out at 25 65 c which is higher than the glass transition temperature tg of polyethylene and does not change the rubber structure of polyethylene mps according to the results of xps characterization the surface oxygen content of the three modified mps was improved as shown in table 1 the presence of these oxygen containing functional groups alters the facial chemistry of the modified mps thereby altering the adsorption behaviour of the hocs on the mps in the study of carbon nanotubes by gotovac et al 2007 it was found that electron withdrawing groups on the surface of oxidized carbon nanotubes can enhance the π π effect between phenanthrene and carbon nanotubes thereby enhancing the adsorption amount of phenanthrene on the carbon nanotubes this behaviour explains why there is only a difference in surface oxygen content between the pristine mps and uv mps but the uv mps have a slightly higher sorption capacity for highly hydrophobic pahs than mps this is because the oxygen containing groups introduced on the surface of the pristine mps by ultraviolet irradiation can be regarded as electron donating groups which enhance the π electron density of the surface of the mps j y chen et al 2008a w chen et al 2008b the more hydrophobic pahs have a more planar structure so π π effects become more obvious as shown in fig 2 and table 1 the surface of the mps changed greatly after etching compared to the pristine mps the surface area of the emps increased by 3 4 times while the average pore diameter became 8 66 nm the surface change in the uv emps is the most intense compared to the pristine mps the surface area of the uv emps is increased by 4 8 times while the average pore diameter became 7 37 nm the emps and uv emps have larger specific surfaces and an increased small pore structure diameter 10 nm so it is not surprising that the modified mps combine with more freely dissolved pahs this explains why emps and uv emps can significantly reduce the f value of higher hydrophobic pahs in solution 3 5 sorption isotherms and desorption kinetics of phenanthrene on modified microplastics in the above nd spme study we only measured the change in pah cfree value in the solution after the balance between microplastics and contaminants and the sorption mechanisms of pahs on different modified mps were obtained via indirect derivation also the desorption process of pahs from different modified microplastics cannot be obtained by the nd spme method therefore in this part we used phenanthrene as a model pah to study directly the sorption isotherms and desorption kinetics of pah to different modified microplastics the isothermal sorption line of the emps and uv emps gradually changes from linear to nonlinear in fig s8 and table s5 because the pores of the surface of pristine mps and uv mps are negligible for emps and uv emps the modification results in a large number of pores being introduced the freundlich model is better at describing the sorption of phenanthrene in emps and uv emps such results are also foreseeable as the increase in pores shifts the isotherm toward nonlinear sorption allen king et al 2002 kleineidam et al 2002 this result verified what we concluded by the nd spme method that the sorption of pahs on mps is mainly based on partitioning however a mechanism of adsorption also likely takes place in emps and uv emps due to pore sorption we use the semi analytical model described by seidensticker et al to describe the kinetic mass transfer between aqueous solutions of organic contaminants and spherical particles of polyethylene seidensticker et al 2017 this model is a good explanation for the dominant mechanism in the desorption process of pahs from different modified microplastics fig 6 shows the measured concentration time series and the model results of the fitted complete model blue solid lines considering only the model prediction of the external mass transfer using the full model parameters red dashed line and considering only the intraparticle diffusion table s5 contains the estimated values of the mass transfer coefficients and the intraparticle diffusion coefficient as well as the ranges of their 5 95 quantiles fig 6 shows the excellent agreement between the phenanthrene desorption experiment results and the simulation results in the initial stage of desorption this part of the experimental data is lacking due to the difficulty of experimental sampling and instrumental analysis conditions for all pe microplastics early models at the beginning of desorption showed that external mass transfer always controlled overall mass transfer when approaching equilibrium intraparticle diffusion becomes the rate limiting step especially for the etch modified microplastics it is more obvious that it is more affected by the intraparticle diffusion at a later stage because the etch modification of microplastics produced a large number of small holes in the surface of emps and uv emps as table 1 and fig 2 show therefore the intraparticle diffusion coefficient obtained by the model fitting is smaller than that of the unmodified microplastic in the study by sven seidensticker et al it has been shown that as the particle size increases the probability of long range transport of pollutants increases and as the diffusion coefficient within the particles increases the probability of long range transport of pollutants decreases seidensticker et al 2019 our results show that the desorption kinetics of the modified polyethylene microplastics is still dominated by film diffusion however the etching modification increases a large number of small pores so that the intraparticle diffusion coefficient of the microplastic particles is reduced and the isotherms are linearly shifted to nonlinear ultimately these modified microplastics will have improved long range transport capabilities for contaminants however koelmans et al have also discussed that microplastic materials do not significantly increase the concentration of contaminants koelmans et al 2016 but it is important for our study to compare the ability of microplastics to carry contaminants before and after modification 4 conclusions mps modified by artificial weathering and ultraviolet ageing were simulated in the laboratory it was found that modified mps especially those modified by etching and etching followed by uv exhibit distinct characteristics from pristine mps thus the effects of various modified mps on hoc availability vary under the simulated conditions the polyethylene plastics are still rubber polymers so the interaction between polyethylene plastics and hydrophobic organic pollutants is mainly partitioning however in the process of artificial weathering etching the specific surface area of the mps substantially increases and a large number of small pore structures are introduced to increase adsorption by mps with large molecular weight and strong hydrophobicity that is the ability of different modified mps to carry hydrophobic organic pollutants increases which is very important for studying the toxicity of mps in conjunction with hydrophobic organic pollutants in the actual environment desorption study indicated that pah desorption from mps are dominated by film diffusion however the intraparticle diffusion process also takes great part for the mps with the etching modification due to increase of small pores ultimately these modified microplastics will have improved long range transport capabilities for contaminants declaration of competing interest the

18263,white rot fungi have been studied for the removal of micropollutants of emerging concern from wastewater during the last decade however several issues need to be overcome for its plausible implementation at full scale installations such as the addition of supplementary substrates the partial re inoculation of fresh fungi or the use of extended hydraulic retention times this work proposes the immobilization of trametes versicolor on rotating biological contactors at bench scale flowrates of 10 l d and reactor capacity of 10 l for the treatment of different urban wastewater this type of bioreactor achieved remarkable reductions of the total organic carbon loading of the wastewater 70 75 in a wide range of c n and c p ratios with limited addition of supplementary substrates non refreshment of the fungal biomass and only 1 day of hydraulic retention the addition of gallic acid as quinone like mediator and quelated iron and manganese complexes increased the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants mediated by the so called advanced bio oxidation process the immobilization of trametes versicolor on rotating biological contactors also showed a remarkable stabilization of the fungi during the continuous treatment of different urban wastewater under non sterile conditions thus this system is a sound alternative for biological urban wastewater treatment with pharmaceutical removal because overcome all the problems usually associated with the water treatment technologies based on white rot fungi that makes difficult the scaling up of the process and its implementation in full scale wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords white rot fungi rotating biological contactors advanced bio oxidation process continuous operation urban wastewater 1 introduction pharmaceutical compounds phacs are considered a group of emerging concern micropollutants for the environment and human health due to their capacity of bioaccumulation toxicity and persistence sauvé and desrosiers 2014 municipal effluents are one of the main sources of phacs in aquatic environment due to the limited efficiency of wastewater treatment plants wwtps to remove them verlicchi et al 2013 nowadays the development of performing sustainable wastewater facilities within the removal of emerging concern micropollutants including phacs commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 has emerged as a critical duty in the environmental research field evgenidou et al 2015 white rot fungi wrf are basidiomycetes that can degrade the lignin component of complex lignocellulose substrates wrf are such a robust organisms with a high tolerance to toxic environments and they withstand high temperatures in a wide range of ph moore et al 2011 the ability of the lignin degrading wrf is related to their unspecific oxidative enzymatic system with lignin modifiers extra cellular enzymes especially oxidases and peroxidases and intra cellular enzymatic complexes such as cytochrome p450 liang et al 2012 syed and yadav 2012 this ability of the fungi to oxidize and even mineralize aromatic ring containing compounds make them applicable to other aromatic pollutants olicón hernández et al 2017 in addition the production of hydrogen peroxide in ligninolytic fungal cultures has been proven by different mechanisms based on peroxide generating enzymes such as glucose or glyoxal oxidases daniel et al 1994 zhao and janse 1996 the ubiquitous formation of hydrogen peroxide upon wrf systems enables the generation of hydroxyl radicals through fenton like reactions by quelated iron complexes of the medium krueger et al 2016 this process has been suggested to be site specific in nature with production of hydroxyl radicals occurring in the fungi cell wall close to lignin and cellulose backa et al 1993 several works have also demonstrated that the production of hydroxyl radicals can be enhanced by addition of quinone like mediators these compounds favor quinone redox cycles driven by intracellular quinone reductase and extracellular lignin modifying enzymes to produce hydrogen peroxide gómez toribio et al 2009 guillén et al 2000 the non specificity and high potential oxidation of hydroxyl radicals makes them very effective for the degradation of non biodegradable pollutants thus wrf are considered a potential alternative for the removal of micropollutants of emerging concern such as phacs christoforidis et al 2018 del álamo et al 2018 marco urrea et al 2009 palli et al 2017 wen et al 2011 previous works of wrf based systems have been focused on the removal of phacs in malt extract synthetic mediums optimum for fungal growth in order to explore their degradation pathways and by products nguyen et al 2013 yang et al 2013a others have been focused on the treatment of real effluents coming from urban cruz morató et al 2013 badia fabregat et al 2017 hospital cruz morató et al 2014 mir tutusaus et al 2017 and veterinary badia fabregat et al 2016 depuration facilities in case of real wastewater streams the treatments were performed with fungal processes in which the wastewater was supplemented with a considerable amount of substrates in these works the removal of the organic loading and nutrients was not deeply studied under non sterile conditions recently a critical review of the limiting drawbacks of wrf to be considered a real wastewater treatment alternative for the removal of organics micropollutants has been reported mir tutusaus et al 2018a the addition of supplementary carbon and nitrogen sources readily biodegradable during operation is one of the limitations of wrf badia fabregat et al 2015 cruz morató et al 2013 glucose and ammonium tartrate has been the preferred compounds in most of studies badia fabregat et al 2015 jelic et al 2012 zhang and geißen 2012 this is a serious limitation for up scaling the process due to the cost of these substrates when a large volume of wastewater is treated other important limitation is the bacterial contamination of the biomass fixed in the reactor under non sterile conditions these non inoculated microorganisms exert the competition for substrates leading to the loss and destabilization of fungal biomass and consequently reducing the removal of micropollutants the coexistence of the fungus and autochthonous microorganisms from wastewater both native fungal and bacteria communities has been recently studied by badia fabregat et al 2016 2017 several strategies have been proposed to promote the wrf growth over bacteria they include the control of the c n ratio the periodical biomass renewal or the immobilization of the fungal biomass however none all of them has been completely satisfactory some works have studied the treatment of simulated wastewater with model micropollutants in optimal c n conditions under sterile conditions at lab scale malachova et al 2013 novotný et al 2012 however the c n ratio is depending on the wastewater nature and the addition of supplementary sources to achieve the optimal composition is not feasible from an economical point of view the option of partial biomass renovation requires an external system for cultivation and growth of fresh wrf that should be periodically inoculated in the reactor it usually implies a significant withdrawal of wrf biomass from the reactor and replacement by fresh wrf badia fabregat et al 2016 blánquez et al 2006 finally the immobilization of the fungal biomass into carriers supports allows the decoupling of hydraulic retention time hrt and the sludge retention time srt producing the wash out of the suspended bacteria microorganisms this is a good strategy but a minimum hrt of 2 days was necessary for an effective removal of micropollutants blánquez et al 2008 hai et al 2009 the immobilization of fungal biomass also reduces the problems of wrf growth in dispersed mycelium on the reactor surfaces wall or stirrers thus different solutions have been studied such as the growth of fungus in form of pellets blánquez et al 2006 borràs et al 2008 espinosa ortiz et al 2016 or the immobilization on inert polyurethane or non inert wooden chips and wooden residues carriers li et al 2016 liang et al 2012 torán et al 2017 fixed bed reactors fluidized bed reactors and membrane biological reactors mbr were the technologies usually found in literature in these cases hai et al 2013 jelic et al 2012 nguyen et al 2013 rodarte morales et al 2012 torán et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 interestingly the immobilization of fungi into carriers has shown an enhancement of the efficiency of the fungal treatment especially in non sterile conditions li et al 2015 in order to overcome the current limitations of fungal biological treatments this work deals with the use of rotating biological contactors rbcs for the immobilization of trametes versicolor as well known wrf the performance of the process was assessed for the removal of the carbon and nutrients of two real urban wastewater after a primary treatment the addition of a quinone like mediator and quelated iron and manganese complexes was studied with the purpose to enhance the potential capacity of fungi for the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants through the so called advanced bio oxidation process via the production of non selective oxidizing hydroxyl radicals the continuous treatment of real wastewaters was performed with non addition of extra supplementary biodegradable sources and non renovation of fungal biomass at reduced hrt of 1 day finally the prevalence of fungi after the prolonged continuous treatment of the different wastewaters under non sterile conditions was also analysed 2 material and methods 2 1 fungus strain the strain t versicolor cect 20817 was collected from the colección española de cultivos tipo cect and maintained by sub culturing on 2 malt extract agar slants ph 4 5 at 25 c blended mycelial mass was produced according to a procedure previously described vasiliadou et al 2016 del álamo et al 2018 and used as fungal inoculum to the rotating biological contactors rbcs 2 2 immobilization of t versicolor on rotating biological contactors rbcs the rbcs were provided by acai depuración s l huesca spain the bioreactor made of aisi 304 stainless steel is equipped with five rotating discs 30 cm diameter made of polypropylene which provide a total surface area of 0 71 m2 the working volume was set to 10 l with the immersion of ca 40 of the discs into the wastewater during operation to ensure an appropriate aeration of the reactor the set of the discs was mechanically rotated at 12 rpm di palma and verdone 2009 the bioreactor inoculated with the blended mycelial fungal inoculum was initially operated in fed batch mode for 30 days start up period until obtaining a homogeneous biofilm immobilized over the discs fig s1 during this stage the reactor was operated in draw fill cycles vasiliadou et al 2016 using a malt extract solution as specific fungal growth medium with ca 3 g l of toc concentration and ph of 4 5 once 50 of the initial toc was consumed 1 l of the reactor s medium was replaced with fresh malt extract 10 volume exchange in order to restore again a toc concentration of 3 g l and to start a new draw fill cycle after this start up period the malt extract was substituted by a synthetic urban wastewater with a composition as described elsewhere del álamo et al 2018 the overall toc loading and ph were maintained at 3 g l and 4 5 respectively the bioreactor was operated with the synthetic urban wastewater acclimation stage for 20 days the excess of organic content and ph 4 5 in both stages was used in order to maximize the production of extracellular polysaccharides eps that promotes the adhesion of t versicolor over the discs surface nimtz et al 2008 tavares et al 2005 finally the bioreactor was operated under continuous mode for the treatment of real urban wastewater effluents coming from two different wastewater treatment plants wwtps 2 3 wastewater samples and operation conditions of fungal biological treatment different wastewater samples were collected from i demo pilot plant located in rey juan carlos university móstoles campus madrid spain designed to 1800 equivalent inhabitants providing a capacity of 360 m3 d dpp urjc and ii wastewater treatment plant at toledo spain of 65 000 equivalent inhabitants currently working with 8800 m3 d wwtp toledo several samples of both dpp urjc and wwtp toledo facilities were used for the study of different operation conditions table 1 summarizes the characterization data of the wastewater samples and the operating conditions of rbcs for the treatment of the different real urban wastewater

l and complexed metal sources fe2 c2o4 3 6h2o 145 mg l and mn no3 2 4h2o 20 mg l as promoters of quinone redox cycles and fenton reactions concentrations of these chemicals were taken from previous works gómez toribio et al 2009 christoforidis et al 2018 del álamo et al 2018 the loadings in the continuous influents of the rbcs for the treatment of all wastewaters were 0 85 1 12 and 0 14 g d of gallic acid iron oxalate and manganese nitrate respectively the inlet streams were adjusted to a ph of 4 5 in order to inhibit the bacteria cellular transport leading to the predominance of fungi activity in the bioreactor jo et al 2010 mir tutusaus et al 2018a the hydraulic retention time hrt was fixed at 1 day for all the wastewater samples minimum value reported in literature for continuous reactors based on white rot fungi mir tutusaus et al 2018a except for dpp urjc 3 sample that was decreased at 0 5 day 2 4 characterization techniques and analytical methods samples were dairy withdrawn from inlet and outlet streams of the rbcs to monitor the performance of the fungal biological treatments in terms of the macroscopic parameters shown in table 1 additionally samples taken

supplementary information following this method 23 phacs of 7 different therapeutic groups were identified and quantified all the samples were analysed by triplicate the detection and quantification limits lod and loq respectively of the method for each phacs are shown in table s1 2 5 assessment of fungal bacteria activity for communities of the biofilm of rbcs several bioassays were performed in order to estimate the presence of fungi and bacteria communities in the biofilm of the rbcs as consequence of the continuous treatment of wastewaters under non sterile conditions these tests were performed batch wise in 160 ml bottles using 100 ml of a synthetic wastewater adjusted to ph of 4 5 or 7 with diluted solutions of naoh or h2so4 the synthetic wastewater was prepared as described elsewhere del álamo et al 2018 but substituting the organic carbon sources by sodium acetate as readily biodegradable substrate the bottles were inoculated with 200 mg dry based vss l of biomass collected from the biofilm formed over the rbcs after the biological treatments of dpp urjc and wwtp toledo wastewaters additionally gram and gram bactericides ampicillin 4 mg l and tetracycline 128 mg l or fungicide nystatin 200 mg l were added and maintained for 24 h under continuous stirring at 25 c to inhibit the bacterial or fungal activity the minimal inhibitory concentration of each chemical was set according to previous studies araya cloutier et al 2017 han et al 2012 mawabo et al 2015 finally 250 mg l of toc as sodium acetate was added to the medium to start the bioassays further bioassays in absence of bactericides and fungicide were also carried out with the purpose of comparison the bottles were incubated under controlled temperature 25 c during 4 days at 300 rpm in absence of abo promoters 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of abo mediators on the fungal activity of t versicolor initially the effect of adding advanced bio oxidation abo mediators was studied with dpp urjc 1 and dpp urjc 2 samples the rbcs were operated with the dpp urjc 1 wastewater in absence of oxidizing mediators for 65 days fungal treatment fung t and then the abo mediators were added to the inlet dpp urjc 2 wastewater for further 32 days advanced bio oxidation treatment abo t the immersed area and rotation speed of rbcs as well as the hrt were kept constant fig 1 a b shows the performance of rbcs in terms of toc n nh4 and p po4 3 removals and elimination of pharmaceutical micropollutants for both systems the ph and do in the effluents hardly changed for the fungal and advanced bio oxidation treatments with values of 6 52 0 39 and 4 39 0 29 mg l respectively confidence intervals of toc n nh4 and p po4 3 removals were calculated according to the t distribution at 95 for 30 fung t and 15 abo t samples the fungal treatment showed remarkable removals of toc 70 8 and phosphates 37 29 in contrast the ammonium removal was practically negligible the addition of abo mediators showed similar toc reductions and the increase of n nh4 and p po4 3 removals but these variations are not statistically significant these results prove an active and stable performance of the biomass immobilized on rbcs for the treatment of a real wastewater with a low c n ratio between 1 2 and 0 6 too far from the theoretical optimum range for wrf of 7 10 operating without additional loadings of biodegradable carbon and nitrogen extra sources as usually employed in other works mir tutusaus et al 2016 torán et al 2017 the potential capacity of reducing the toc has been hardly studied in literature but is a crucial point in the development of a real wastewater treatment process based on t versicolor palli et al 2017 the low ammonium removal seems to be related to the limited nitrogen uptake of the wrf cruz morató et al 2013 mir tutusaus et al 2018a moreover nh4 can be released by ammonification of urea with partial assimilation of nitrogen and release of the ammonium in excess to the medium geisseler et al 2010 the balance between the uptake and release of ammonium is influenced by the nutritional status of the fungal community starvation or nitrogen excess the c n ratio of the population and the quantity and chemical composition of dissolved organic matter typically fungi release nitrogen as ammonium for a c n ratio lower than 30 1 hodge et al 2000 thus it is expected that the ammonification process happened considering the low c n ratios of the urban wastewater used in this work in particular dpp urjc wastewater see table 1 it must be also pointed out that the amount of gallic acid was almost completely consumed 98 with a very low concentration 2 mg l in the outlet effluent likewise the concentrations of fe and mn from the quelated metal promoters were lower than 1 mg l and ca 8 mg l respectively thus the use of the abo promoters as well as derivative by products did not show any sign of toxic effect on the biological treatment in terms of the phacs removal only 9 out of the 23 phacs analysed in this work table s2 were detected in samples of dpp urjc 1 and dpp urjc 2 fig 1b 3 antibiotics amoxicillin amx metronidazole mdz and sulfamethoxazole smx 2 psychiatric drugs carbamazepine cpz and caffeine cfn 1 analgesic 4 acetamidoantipyrine 4 aaa 1 lipid regulator gemfibrozil gfz 1 chemical diuretic hydrochlorothiazide hct and 1 contrast agent iohexol ihx cfn and amx that the last one was recently included in the watch list of priority substances modified by the commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 were the phacs detected in the highest concentration in dpp urjc 1 and dpp urjc 2 samples the fungal treatment fung t showed moderate removals with values below 40 for 7 phacs only caffeine achieved an elimination higher than 80 but this compound is considered easily removed by other biological treatments ibrahim et al 2014 the functional groups of the chemical structure as well as the hydrophilic hydrophobic behaviour of the phacs strongly affect their removal yang et al 2013b in general phacs containing electron donating functional groups such as amine nh2 hydroxyl oh or alkoxy or groups are more susceptible to be biologically degraded by the oxidative catabolism of fungi on the contrary phacs containing strong electron acceptor functional groups such as czp containing azepine an amide conr2 group are majorly degraded by extracellular lignin modifying enzymes but with lower removal degrees marco urrea et al 2009 rodríguez rodríguez et al 2010 on the other hand hydrophobicity plays a critical role in biosorption of micropollutants in the wrf enhancing its removal from the aqueous phase hydrophobic micropollutants log kow 3 2 such as gfz are easily removed by wrf grandclément et al 2017 however elimination of hydrophilic compounds log kow 3 2 is highly dependent on the presence of electron donor and or acceptor groups grandclément et al 2017 yang et al 2013b the presence of the strong electron acceptor groups of amide and iodine in the ihx prevails over its electron donating hydroxyl groups hindering their biological oxidation moreover the ph of the aqueous medium is also an important factor hydrophilic compounds with pka phmedium are expected to be as ionic forms promoting its solubility in the aqueous phase and making more difficult their elimination it seems the case of 4 aaa amx mdz smx and hct for example hct possess electron withdrawing groups sulphonamide and chlorine and amine donating group being the biodegradability comparable to that obtained for smx which accounts for the same opposing groups sulphonamide and amide see table s2 the negative removals of ihx amx and 4 aaa are in agreement with previous observations collado et al 2014 due to concentrations in the effluent higher than in the influent this fact has been reported very often for recalcitrant compounds to biological oxidation like cpz dcf or amx palli et al 2019 attributing these results to different factors i the conversion of conjugated metabolites to their parent compound through enzymatic processes ii sudden release of pharmaceuticals from sludge iii sampling variations due to long hydraulic retention times and iv the limited analytical capabilities for low concentrations the promotion of highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals by abo mediators increased the elimination of 4 aaa amx and ihx up to 23 34 and 77 respectively significant increases were also accomplished for hct and mdz both around 50 and gfz and smx 82 and 89 respectively likewise it must be noted that these results were obtained under continuous operation of rbcs with a hrt of only 1 day and non supplementary addition of extra biodegradable carbon and nitrogen sources which have been very influencing factors in the performance of alternative bioreactors using t versicolor such as fixed bed columns or fluidized bed reactors for the treatment of wastewaters blánquez et al 2008 hai et al 2009 palli et al 2017 torán et al 2017 3 2 effect of hrt on the performance of advanced bio oxidation treatment on rbcs abo t rbcs the immobilization of t versicolor on the surface of the rbc s discs makes possible decoupling the hydraulic retention time and cellular retention time hrts ranging from 1 to 3 days have been reported for fungal treatments lower hrts usually limit the performance of the treatment decreasing the removal of micropollutants in order to consider the potential capacity of t versicolor immobilized over rbcs as alternative to biological treatment to be implemented in a conventional wwtp a hrt of 0 5 days was studied for the treatment of dpp urjc 3 wastewater fig 2 a b shows the performance of abo t on rbcs operating with a hrt of 1 day dpp urjc 2 and 0 5 days dpp urjc 3 as expected the toc removal decreased when reducing the hrt a less significant reduction was observed for the phosphate content in the case of ammonium the removal was improved from ca 10 20 this is a consequence of a limited ammonification of the nitrogen containing organic compounds leading to less ammonium concentration by the nitrogen uptake of the microorganisms of the biological treatment moreover it must be pointed out that the ammonium nitrogen content of dpp urjc 3 is much lower than that found by dpp urjc 2 nevertheless the most important influence of decreasing the hrt was obtained in the phacs removal efficiency fig 2b table s2 it should be pointed out that dpp urjc 2 and dpp urjc 3 samples were taken from the same wastewater treatment plant but at different periods of time consequently concentration of phacs varied in their composition additionally diclofenac non steroidal anti inflammatory drug dcf was detected during operation with dpp urjc 3 instead of amx see table s2 an extremely decrease in the phacs removal was observed working at hrt of 0 5 days gfz and ihx removal efficiency decayed from 82 to 77 to 70 and 60 respectively whereas hct and mdz decreased from ca 50 to 25 and 20 respectively finally 4 aaa cfn czp and smx were not eliminated showing even negative removal as consequence of their biorefractory behaviour to be degraded and the reasons previously mentioned for the treatment of dpp urjc 1 dcf also showed a removal of only 10 probably due to the presence of non donating electrons groups carboxylic and chloride that make it less willing for both oxidative catabolism and advanced bio oxidation mediated by hydroxyl radicals attack mazzafera 2002 tang and huang 1996 yan et al 2017 thus it can be concluded that the decrease of the hrt from 1 to 0 5 day dramatically reduced the efficiency of phacs removal on the rotating biological contactors 3 3 influence of wastewater composition on the biological performance of fungal rbcs the validation of the abo t on rbcs for a plausible implementation in a conventional wastewater treatment plant requires its evaluation for several types of wastewater in this context two wastewater samples wwtp toledo 1 and wwtp toledo 2 taken at different periods of time from a wwtp in the north of toledo spain and a wastewater stream from the demo wastewater pilot plant at rey juan carlos university dpp urjc 2 were compared all the wastewaters were collected from the outlet streams of primary treatment in the depuration facilities the wwtp toledo 1 and wwtp toledo 2 wastewater samples showed similar c n ratios and they have higher c n ratio than dpp urjc 2 wastewater samples ca 3 1 vs 1 1 5 respectively however the c p ratios of wwtp toledo 1 and wwtp toledo 2 streams are different 6 1 and 50 1 respectively whereas the c p ratio of dpp urjc 2 ca 8 1 is quite similar to that of the wwtp toledo 1 table 1 concerning the pharmaceutical micropollutants amx was not detected in wwtp toledo 1 and 2 ihx was not detected in wwtp toledo 2 and dcf and n n diethyl meta toluamide an insect repellent deet were found only in the wwtp toledo 2 sample table s2 the variation of c p composition of wwtp toledo 1 to wwtp toledo 2 wastewater did not modify the efficiency of the biological treatment during operation macronutrients and phacs removals thus a low of phosphate content of the wastewater does not limit the performance of the advanced bio oxidation fungal treatment see table s3 the higher c n ratio of wwtp toledo 2 respect to dpp urjc 2 wastewater samples promoted a slight improvement of the toc n nh4 p po4 3 removals fig 3 a this fact is probably due to the best performance of biological fungal systems with higher c n ratios a high c n ratio mimics the optimal conditions of white rot fungi for degradation of lignin in natural lignocellulosic substrates which increases the production of lignin modifying enzymes elgueta et al 2016 rousk and bã ã th 2007 typically it is reported in literature an optimum c n ratio ranging from 7 to 10 jo et al 2010 mir tutusaus et al 2018b moreover a high c n ratio ensures the fungal growth and maintenance under non sterile conditions over bacterial populations regarding the effect of c p content there is not information reported about its influence on fungal biological systems the elimination of phacs fig 3b table s2 showed similar removals for 4 aaa cfn cpz and gfz in both wastewater samples wwtp toledo 2 and dpp urjc 2 in turn the removal of antibiotics mdz and smx slightly decreased for the wwtp toledo 2 wastewater thus it seems that the slight improvement of biological performance in terms of the toc n nh4 and p po4 3 removals is not related to a higher efficiency of the removal of pharmaceuticals however it was seen that the total content of pharmaceuticals in the wwtp toledo 2 wastewater ca 59 μg l is considerable higher than in the dpp urjc 2 wastewater ca 32 μg l taking into account these data the efficiency of the treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals could be affected by its loading rate as it can be deduced from the overall efficiency of all the pharmaceuticals detected 59 for dpp urjc 2 versus 46 for wwtp toledo 2 likewise it must be pointed out the remarkable tolerance of the fungal treatment for the range of the pharmaceutical loadings of these two wastewaters from 317 μg d dpp urjc 2 to 590 μg d wwtp toledo 2 all the results related to the total concentration and overall removal efficiencies can be found in table s4 3 4 assessment of the prevalence of fungal or bacterial communities in the biofilm of rbcs after treatment of dpp urjc and wwtp toledo wastewaters as it has been mentioned the treatment of non sterile wastewater under continuous operation can promote the proliferation of bacterial colonies which compete for the assimilable substrates of the wastewater this fact can produce the prevalence of dominant bacterial colonies which would reduce the efficiency of the fungal advanced bio oxidation process for the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants in order to evaluate the prevalence of fungal or bacterial communities in the rbcs several bioassays with bactericides fungicide and none of them were performed using as inoculums the sludge of the biofilm of the rbcs discs after the treatment of dpp urjc 2 and wwtp toledo 2 wastewaters the consumption of sodium in terms of the toc content was used as indirect measurement of the prevalence of fungal or bacterial communities in the rbcs fig 4 a and b shows the results of the activity tests after 4 days at ph 4 5 and 7 respectively these ph values were chosen according to the ph of the inlet and outlet streams of the rbcs during treatment the profiles of the toc removal for all bioassays along the time are shown in figs s3 and s4 at ph 4 5 fig 4a the wwtp toledo 2 inoculum was more active than the dpp urjc 2 one in presence of the fungicide the wwtp toledo 2 inoculum achieved a toc removal of ca 25 in turn a negligible toc removal was observed by the dpp urjc 2 inoculum the bioassays using bactericides showed similar toc removals than that obtained by the inoculums alone even with a slight increase for the dpp urjc 2 inoculum these results clearly point to a prevalence of fungi in the dpp urjc 2 and wwtp toledo 2 inoculums at ph 7 fig 4b the dpp urjc 2 inoculum was less active in absence of fungicide and bactericides in comparison to the results at ph 4 5 this is a consequence of a more favourable ph for bacterial communities and the decelerated metabolism of fungal communities likewise the activity of bacteria when using the fungicide increased up to ca 37 and 12 for the wwtp toledo 2 and dpp urjc 2 inoculums respectively nevertheless the activity of fungi in bioassays performed with bactericides was much higher than those obtained by bacteria in those with the fungicide this confirms the prevalence of fungal communities on the biofilm of rbcs however the development of bacterial communities during the treatment of both wastewaters is also evident being more important for the inoculum of the wwtp toledo 2 treatment moreover it is observed that this inoculum displayed a slight decrease of activity for the bactericides bioassays as compared to those performed with the inoculum alone these results indicates that the higher proportion of bacteria microorganisms for this inoculum reduces the activity of both fungal and bacterial communities probably due to the competitive substrate consumption on the other hand the increase of the bacterial proportion in the inoculum of the wwtp toledo 2 could be related to the higher c n ratio of this wastewater three times higher than the dpp urjc 2 effluent summarizing and looking at the results obtained at ph 7 real ph of operation of the rbcs the bacterial communities will be contributing to the biological performance of the rbcs moreover the increasing competition of bacteria for the substrate could lead to loss of fungal biomass and the destabilization of fungal enzymes del álamo et al 2018 hai et al 2013 additionally the decrease in the fungi proportion would produce a reduction of the efficiency of phacs removal badia fabregat et al 2017 thus as the rbcs are less colonized by bacterial communities during the treatment of dpp urjc 2 a higher efficiency for phacs removal was achieved denoted by the major elimination of antibiotics the higher proportion of fungal biomass will increase the production of non selective oxidizing hydroxyl radicals through the advanced bio oxidation process enhancing the removal of more bio refractory micropollutants christoforidis et al 2018 4 conclusions the efficiency of t versicolor as white rot fungi immobilized on rotating biological contactors rbcs for the treatment of urban wastewater of different depuration facilities has been demonstrated the presence of advanced bio oxidation promoters a lignin derived mediator and metal complexes with redox activity enhanced the performance of fungal biological treatment for the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants increasing significantly the elimination of 4 aaa amx ihx and smx among others remarkable removals of the organic content ca 70 75 of toc were achieved with organic loadings between 32 and 60 mg toc h and c n and c p ratios ranging from 0 6 to 2 8 and 6 to 50 respectively these results were accomplished operating with non addition of supplementary biodegradable glucose source non fungal biomass refreshment non external aeration and 1 day of hrt which are the main limitations of fungal biological treatments for plausible implementation in wwtps it was observed the proliferation of bacteria in the biofilm of rbcs as consequence of the continuous treatment of real wastewater under non sterile conditions however the fungal communities dominate the performance of the removal of the organic loading the fungal treatment based on the immobilization of t versicolor on rbcs 10 l d in a reactor of 10 l capacity is considered an effective technology for depuration of real urban wastewaters including the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants although further steps must be done in order to achieve a better stabilization of the fungal biomass and higher removals of nitrogen as nutrient declaration of competing interest the

18263,white rot fungi have been studied for the removal of micropollutants of emerging concern from wastewater during the last decade however several issues need to be overcome for its plausible implementation at full scale installations such as the addition of supplementary substrates the partial re inoculation of fresh fungi or the use of extended hydraulic retention times this work proposes the immobilization of trametes versicolor on rotating biological contactors at bench scale flowrates of 10 l d and reactor capacity of 10 l for the treatment of different urban wastewater this type of bioreactor achieved remarkable reductions of the total organic carbon loading of the wastewater 70 75 in a wide range of c n and c p ratios with limited addition of supplementary substrates non refreshment of the fungal biomass and only 1 day of hydraulic retention the addition of gallic acid as quinone like mediator and quelated iron and manganese complexes increased the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants mediated by the so called advanced bio oxidation process the immobilization of trametes versicolor on rotating biological contactors also showed a remarkable stabilization of the fungi during the continuous treatment of different urban wastewater under non sterile conditions thus this system is a sound alternative for biological urban wastewater treatment with pharmaceutical removal because overcome all the problems usually associated with the water treatment technologies based on white rot fungi that makes difficult the scaling up of the process and its implementation in full scale wastewater treatment plants graphical abstract image 1 keywords white rot fungi rotating biological contactors advanced bio oxidation process continuous operation urban wastewater 1 introduction pharmaceutical compounds phacs are considered a group of emerging concern micropollutants for the environment and human health due to their capacity of bioaccumulation toxicity and persistence sauvé and desrosiers 2014 municipal effluents are one of the main sources of phacs in aquatic environment due to the limited efficiency of wastewater treatment plants wwtps to remove them verlicchi et al 2013 nowadays the development of performing sustainable wastewater facilities within the removal of emerging concern micropollutants including phacs commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 has emerged as a critical duty in the environmental research field evgenidou et al 2015 white rot fungi wrf are basidiomycetes that can degrade the lignin component of complex lignocellulose substrates wrf are such a robust organisms with a high tolerance to toxic environments and they withstand high temperatures in a wide range of ph moore et al 2011 the ability of the lignin degrading wrf is related to their unspecific oxidative enzymatic system with lignin modifiers extra cellular enzymes especially oxidases and peroxidases and intra cellular enzymatic complexes such as cytochrome p450 liang et al 2012 syed and yadav 2012 this ability of the fungi to oxidize and even mineralize aromatic ring containing compounds make them applicable to other aromatic pollutants olicón hernández et al 2017 in addition the production of hydrogen peroxide in ligninolytic fungal cultures has been proven by different mechanisms based on peroxide generating enzymes such as glucose or glyoxal oxidases daniel et al 1994 zhao and janse 1996 the ubiquitous formation of hydrogen peroxide upon wrf systems enables the generation of hydroxyl radicals through fenton like reactions by quelated iron complexes of the medium krueger et al 2016 this process has been suggested to be site specific in nature with production of hydroxyl radicals occurring in the fungi cell wall close to lignin and cellulose backa et al 1993 several works have also demonstrated that the production of hydroxyl radicals can be enhanced by addition of quinone like mediators these compounds favor quinone redox cycles driven by intracellular quinone reductase and extracellular lignin modifying enzymes to produce hydrogen peroxide gómez toribio et al 2009 guillén et al 2000 the non specificity and high potential oxidation of hydroxyl radicals makes them very effective for the degradation of non biodegradable pollutants thus wrf are considered a potential alternative for the removal of micropollutants of emerging concern such as phacs christoforidis et al 2018 del álamo et al 2018 marco urrea et al 2009 palli et al 2017 wen et al 2011 previous works of wrf based systems have been focused on the removal of phacs in malt extract synthetic mediums optimum for fungal growth in order to explore their degradation pathways and by products nguyen et al 2013 yang et al 2013a others have been focused on the treatment of real effluents coming from urban cruz morató et al 2013 badia fabregat et al 2017 hospital cruz morató et al 2014 mir tutusaus et al 2017 and veterinary badia fabregat et al 2016 depuration facilities in case of real wastewater streams the treatments were performed with fungal processes in which the wastewater was supplemented with a considerable amount of substrates in these works the removal of the organic loading and nutrients was not deeply studied under non sterile conditions recently a critical review of the limiting drawbacks of wrf to be considered a real wastewater treatment alternative for the removal of organics micropollutants has been reported mir tutusaus et al 2018a the addition of supplementary carbon and nitrogen sources readily biodegradable during operation is one of the limitations of wrf badia fabregat et al 2015 cruz morató et al 2013 glucose and ammonium tartrate has been the preferred compounds in most of studies badia fabregat et al 2015 jelic et al 2012 zhang and geißen 2012 this is a serious limitation for up scaling the process due to the cost of these substrates when a large volume of wastewater is treated other important limitation is the bacterial contamination of the biomass fixed in the reactor under non sterile conditions these non inoculated microorganisms exert the competition for substrates leading to the loss and destabilization of fungal biomass and consequently reducing the removal of micropollutants the coexistence of the fungus and autochthonous microorganisms from wastewater both native fungal and bacteria communities has been recently studied by badia fabregat et al 2016 2017 several strategies have been proposed to promote the wrf growth over bacteria they include the control of the c n ratio the periodical biomass renewal or the immobilization of the fungal biomass however none all of them has been completely satisfactory some works have studied the treatment of simulated wastewater with model micropollutants in optimal c n conditions under sterile conditions at lab scale malachova et al 2013 novotný et al 2012 however the c n ratio is depending on the wastewater nature and the addition of supplementary sources to achieve the optimal composition is not feasible from an economical point of view the option of partial biomass renovation requires an external system for cultivation and growth of fresh wrf that should be periodically inoculated in the reactor it usually implies a significant withdrawal of wrf biomass from the reactor and replacement by fresh wrf badia fabregat et al 2016 blánquez et al 2006 finally the immobilization of the fungal biomass into carriers supports allows the decoupling of hydraulic retention time hrt and the sludge retention time srt producing the wash out of the suspended bacteria microorganisms this is a good strategy but a minimum hrt of 2 days was necessary for an effective removal of micropollutants blánquez et al 2008 hai et al 2009 the immobilization of fungal biomass also reduces the problems of wrf growth in dispersed mycelium on the reactor surfaces wall or stirrers thus different solutions have been studied such as the growth of fungus in form of pellets blánquez et al 2006 borràs et al 2008 espinosa ortiz et al 2016 or the immobilization on inert polyurethane or non inert wooden chips and wooden residues carriers li et al 2016 liang et al 2012 torán et al 2017 fixed bed reactors fluidized bed reactors and membrane biological reactors mbr were the technologies usually found in literature in these cases hai et al 2013 jelic et al 2012 nguyen et al 2013 rodarte morales et al 2012 torán et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 interestingly the immobilization of fungi into carriers has shown an enhancement of the efficiency of the fungal treatment especially in non sterile conditions li et al 2015 in order to overcome the current limitations of fungal biological treatments this work deals with the use of rotating biological contactors rbcs for the immobilization of trametes versicolor as well known wrf the performance of the process was assessed for the removal of the carbon and nutrients of two real urban wastewater after a primary treatment the addition of a quinone like mediator and quelated iron and manganese complexes was studied with the purpose to enhance the potential capacity of fungi for the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants through the so called advanced bio oxidation process via the production of non selective oxidizing hydroxyl radicals the continuous treatment of real wastewaters was performed with non addition of extra supplementary biodegradable sources and non renovation of fungal biomass at reduced hrt of 1 day finally the prevalence of fungi after the prolonged continuous treatment of the different wastewaters under non sterile conditions was also analysed 2 material and methods 2 1 fungus strain the strain t versicolor cect 20817 was collected from the colección española de cultivos tipo cect and maintained by sub culturing on 2 malt extract agar slants ph 4 5 at 25 c blended mycelial mass was produced according to a procedure previously described vasiliadou et al 2016 del álamo et al 2018 and used as fungal inoculum to the rotating biological contactors rbcs 2 2 immobilization of t versicolor on rotating biological contactors rbcs the rbcs were provided by acai depuración s l huesca spain the bioreactor made of aisi 304 stainless steel is equipped with five rotating discs 30 cm diameter made of polypropylene which provide a total surface area of 0 71 m2 the working volume was set to 10 l with the immersion of ca 40 of the discs into the wastewater during operation to ensure an appropriate aeration of the reactor the set of the discs was mechanically rotated at 12 rpm di palma and verdone 2009 the bioreactor inoculated with the blended mycelial fungal inoculum was initially operated in fed batch mode for 30 days start up period until obtaining a homogeneous biofilm immobilized over the discs fig s1 during this stage the reactor was operated in draw fill cycles vasiliadou et al 2016 using a malt extract solution as specific fungal growth medium with ca 3 g l of toc concentration and ph of 4 5 once 50 of the initial toc was consumed 1 l of the reactor s medium was replaced with fresh malt extract 10 volume exchange in order to restore again a toc concentration of 3 g l and to start a new draw fill cycle after this start up period the malt extract was substituted by a synthetic urban wastewater with a composition as described elsewhere del álamo et al 2018 the overall toc loading and ph were maintained at 3 g l and 4 5 respectively the bioreactor was operated with the synthetic urban wastewater acclimation stage for 20 days the excess of organic content and ph 4 5 in both stages was used in order to maximize the production of extracellular polysaccharides eps that promotes the adhesion of t versicolor over the discs surface nimtz et al 2008 tavares et al 2005 finally the bioreactor was operated under continuous mode for the treatment of real urban wastewater effluents coming from two different wastewater treatment plants wwtps 2 3 wastewater samples and operation conditions of fungal biological treatment different wastewater samples were collected from i demo pilot plant located in rey juan carlos university móstoles campus madrid spain designed to 1800 equivalent inhabitants providing a capacity of 360 m3 d dpp urjc and ii wastewater treatment plant at toledo spain of 65 000 equivalent inhabitants currently working with 8800 m3 d wwtp toledo several samples of both dpp urjc and wwtp toledo facilities were used for the study of different operation conditions table 1 summarizes the characterization data of the wastewater samples and the operating conditions of rbcs for the treatment of the different real urban wastewater effluents all the wastewater samples except dpp urjc 1 were treated under advanced bio oxidation abo conditions that comprises the addition of a lignin derived quinone type mediator gallic acid 85 mg l and complexed metal sources fe2 c2o4 3 6h2o 145 mg l and mn no3 2 4h2o 20 mg l as promoters of quinone redox cycles and fenton reactions concentrations of these chemicals were taken from previous works gómez toribio et al 2009 christoforidis et al 2018 del álamo et al 2018 the loadings in the continuous influents of the rbcs for the treatment of all wastewaters were 0 85 1 12 and 0 14 g d of gallic acid iron oxalate and manganese nitrate respectively the inlet streams were adjusted to a ph of 4 5 in order to inhibit the bacteria cellular transport leading to the predominance of fungi activity in the bioreactor jo et al 2010 mir tutusaus et al 2018a the hydraulic retention time hrt was fixed at 1 day for all the wastewater samples minimum value reported in literature for continuous reactors based on white rot fungi mir tutusaus et al 2018a except for dpp urjc 3 sample that was decreased at 0 5 day 2 4 characterization techniques and analytical methods samples were dairy withdrawn from inlet and outlet streams of the rbcs to monitor the performance of the fungal biological treatments in terms of the macroscopic parameters shown in table 1 additionally samples taken

supplementary information following this method 23 phacs of 7 different therapeutic groups were identified and quantified all the samples were analysed by triplicate the detection and quantification limits lod and loq respectively of the method for each phacs are shown in table s1 2 5 assessment of fungal bacteria activity for communities of the biofilm of rbcs several bioassays were performed in order to estimate the presence of fungi and bacteria communities in the biofilm of the rbcs as consequence of the continuous treatment of wastewaters under non sterile conditions these tests were performed batch wise in 160 ml bottles using 100 ml of a synthetic wastewater adjusted to ph of 4 5 or 7 with diluted solutions of naoh or h2so4 the synthetic wastewater was prepared as described elsewhere del álamo et al 2018 but substituting the organic carbon sources by sodium acetate as readily biodegradable substrate the bottles were inoculated with 200 mg dry based vss l of biomass collected from the biofilm formed over the rbcs after the biological treatments of dpp urjc and wwtp toledo wastewaters additionally gram and gram bactericides ampicillin 4 mg l and tetracycline 128 mg l or fungicide nystatin 200 mg l were added and maintained for 24 h under continuous stirring at 25 c to inhibit the bacterial or fungal activity the minimal inhibitory concentration of each chemical was set according to previous studies araya cloutier et al 2017 han et al 2012 mawabo et al 2015 finally 250 mg l of toc as sodium acetate was added to the medium to start the bioassays further bioassays in absence of bactericides and fungicide were also carried out with the purpose of comparison the bottles were incubated under controlled temperature 25 c during 4 days at 300 rpm in absence of abo promoters 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of abo mediators on the fungal activity of t versicolor initially the effect of adding advanced bio oxidation abo mediators was studied with dpp urjc 1 and dpp urjc 2 samples the rbcs were operated with the dpp urjc 1 wastewater in absence of oxidizing mediators for 65 days fungal treatment fung t and then the abo mediators were added to the inlet dpp urjc 2 wastewater for further 32 days advanced bio oxidation treatment abo t the immersed area and rotation speed of rbcs as well as the hrt were kept constant fig 1 a b shows the performance of rbcs in terms of toc n nh4 and p po4 3 removals and elimination of pharmaceutical micropollutants for both systems the ph and do in the effluents hardly changed for the fungal and advanced bio oxidation treatments with values of 6 52 0 39 and 4 39 0 29 mg l respectively confidence intervals of toc n nh4 and p po4 3 removals were calculated according to the t distribution at 95 for 30 fung t and 15 abo t samples the fungal treatment showed remarkable removals of toc 70 8 and phosphates 37 29 in contrast the ammonium removal was practically negligible the addition of abo mediators showed similar toc reductions and the increase of n nh4 and p po4 3 removals but these variations are not statistically significant these results prove an active and stable performance of the biomass immobilized on rbcs for the treatment of a real wastewater with a low c n ratio between 1 2 and 0 6 too far from the theoretical optimum range for wrf of 7 10 operating without additional loadings of biodegradable carbon and nitrogen extra sources as usually employed in other works mir tutusaus et al 2016 torán et al 2017 the potential capacity of reducing the toc has been hardly studied in literature but is a crucial point in the development of a real wastewater treatment process based on t versicolor palli et al 2017 the low ammonium removal seems to be related to the limited nitrogen uptake of the wrf cruz morató et al 2013 mir tutusaus et al 2018a moreover nh4 can be released by ammonification of urea with partial assimilation of nitrogen and release of the ammonium in excess to the medium geisseler et al 2010 the balance between the uptake and release of ammonium is influenced by the nutritional status of the fungal community starvation or nitrogen excess the c n ratio of the population and the quantity and chemical composition of dissolved organic matter typically fungi release nitrogen as ammonium for a c n ratio lower than 30 1 hodge et al 2000 thus it is expected that the ammonification process happened considering the low c n ratios of the urban wastewater used in this work in particular dpp urjc wastewater see table 1 it must be also pointed out that the amount of gallic acid was almost completely consumed 98 with a very low concentration 2 mg l in the outlet effluent likewise the concentrations of fe and mn from the quelated metal promoters were lower than 1 mg l and ca 8 mg l respectively thus the use of the abo promoters as well as derivative by products did not show any sign of toxic effect on the biological treatment in terms of the phacs removal only 9 out of the 23 phacs analysed in this work table s2 were detected in samples of dpp urjc 1 and dpp urjc 2 fig 1b 3 antibiotics amoxicillin amx metronidazole mdz and sulfamethoxazole smx 2 psychiatric drugs carbamazepine cpz and caffeine cfn 1 analgesic 4 acetamidoantipyrine 4 aaa 1 lipid regulator gemfibrozil gfz 1 chemical diuretic hydrochlorothiazide hct and 1 contrast agent iohexol ihx cfn and amx that the last one was recently included in the watch list of priority substances modified by the commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 were the phacs detected in the highest concentration in dpp urjc 1 and dpp urjc 2 samples the fungal treatment fung t showed moderate removals with values below 40 for 7 phacs only caffeine achieved an elimination higher than 80 but this compound is considered easily removed by other biological treatments ibrahim et al 2014 the functional groups of the chemical structure as well as the hydrophilic hydrophobic behaviour of the phacs strongly affect their removal yang et al 2013b in general phacs containing electron donating functional groups such as amine nh2 hydroxyl oh or alkoxy or groups are more susceptible to be biologically degraded by the oxidative catabolism of fungi on the contrary phacs containing strong electron acceptor functional groups such as czp containing azepine an amide conr2 group are majorly degraded by extracellular lignin modifying enzymes but with lower removal degrees marco urrea et al 2009 rodríguez rodríguez et al 2010 on the other hand hydrophobicity plays a critical role in biosorption of micropollutants in the wrf enhancing its removal from the aqueous phase hydrophobic micropollutants log kow 3 2 such as gfz are easily removed by wrf grandclément et al 2017 however elimination of hydrophilic compounds log kow 3 2 is highly dependent on the presence of electron donor and or acceptor groups grandclément et al 2017 yang et al 2013b the presence of the strong electron acceptor groups of amide and iodine in the ihx prevails over its electron donating hydroxyl groups hindering their biological oxidation moreover the ph of the aqueous medium is also an important factor hydrophilic compounds with pka phmedium are expected to be as ionic forms promoting its solubility in the aqueous phase and making more difficult their elimination it seems the case of 4 aaa amx mdz smx and hct for example hct possess electron withdrawing groups sulphonamide and chlorine and amine donating group being the biodegradability comparable to that obtained for smx which accounts for the same opposing groups sulphonamide and amide see table s2 the negative removals of ihx amx and 4 aaa are in agreement with previous observations collado et al 2014 due to concentrations in the effluent higher than in the influent this fact has been reported very often for recalcitrant compounds to biological oxidation like cpz dcf or amx palli et al 2019 attributing these results to different factors i the conversion of conjugated metabolites to their parent compound through enzymatic processes ii sudden release of pharmaceuticals from sludge iii sampling variations due to long hydraulic retention times and iv the limited analytical capabilities for low concentrations the promotion of highly oxidizing hydroxyl radicals by abo mediators increased the elimination of 4 aaa amx and ihx up to 23 34 and 77 respectively significant increases were also accomplished for hct and mdz both around 50 and gfz and smx 82 and 89 respectively likewise it must be noted that these results were obtained under continuous operation of rbcs with a hrt of only 1 day and non supplementary addition of extra biodegradable carbon and nitrogen sources which have been very influencing factors in the performance of alternative bioreactors using t versicolor such as fixed bed columns or fluidized bed reactors for the treatment of wastewaters blánquez et al 2008 hai et al 2009 palli et al 2017 torán et al 2017 3 2 effect of hrt on the performance of advanced bio oxidation treatment on rbcs abo t rbcs the immobilization of t versicolor on the surface of the rbc s discs makes possible decoupling the hydraulic retention time and cellular retention time hrts ranging from 1 to 3 days have been reported for fungal treatments lower hrts usually limit the performance of the treatment decreasing the removal of micropollutants in order to consider the potential capacity of t versicolor immobilized over rbcs as alternative to biological treatment to be implemented in a conventional wwtp a hrt of 0 5 days was studied for the treatment of dpp urjc 3 wastewater fig 2 a b shows the performance of abo t on rbcs operating with a hrt of 1 day dpp urjc 2 and 0 5 days dpp urjc 3 as expected the toc removal decreased when reducing the hrt a less significant reduction was observed for the phosphate content in the case of ammonium the removal was improved from ca 10 20 this is a consequence of a limited ammonification of the nitrogen containing organic compounds leading to less ammonium concentration by the nitrogen uptake of the microorganisms of the biological treatment moreover it must be pointed out that the ammonium nitrogen content of dpp urjc 3 is much lower than that found by dpp urjc 2 nevertheless the most important influence of decreasing the hrt was obtained in the phacs removal efficiency fig 2b table s2 it should be pointed out that dpp urjc 2 and dpp urjc 3 samples were taken from the same wastewater treatment plant but at different periods of time consequently concentration of phacs varied in their composition additionally diclofenac non steroidal anti inflammatory drug dcf was detected during operation with dpp urjc 3 instead of amx see table s2 an extremely decrease in the phacs removal was observed working at hrt of 0 5 days gfz and ihx removal efficiency decayed from 82 to 77 to 70 and 60 respectively whereas hct and mdz decreased from ca 50 to 25 and 20 respectively finally 4 aaa cfn czp and smx were not eliminated showing even negative removal as consequence of their biorefractory behaviour to be degraded and the reasons previously mentioned for the treatment of dpp urjc 1 dcf also showed a removal of only 10 probably due to the presence of non donating electrons groups carboxylic and chloride that make it less willing for both oxidative catabolism and advanced bio oxidation mediated by hydroxyl radicals attack mazzafera 2002 tang and huang 1996 yan et al 2017 thus it can be concluded that the decrease of the hrt from 1 to 0 5 day dramatically reduced the efficiency of phacs removal on the rotating biological contactors 3 3 influence of wastewater composition on the biological performance of fungal rbcs the validation of the abo t on rbcs for a plausible implementation in a conventional wastewater treatment plant requires its evaluation for several types of wastewater in this context two wastewater samples wwtp toledo 1 and wwtp toledo 2 taken at different periods of time from a wwtp in the north of toledo spain and a wastewater stream from the demo wastewater pilot plant at rey juan carlos university dpp urjc 2 were compared all the wastewaters were collected from the outlet streams of primary treatment in the depuration facilities the wwtp toledo 1 and wwtp toledo 2 wastewater samples showed similar c n ratios and they have higher c n ratio than dpp urjc 2 wastewater samples ca 3 1 vs 1 1 5 respectively however the c p ratios of wwtp toledo 1 and wwtp toledo 2 streams are different 6 1 and 50 1 respectively whereas the c p ratio of dpp urjc 2 ca 8 1 is quite similar to that of the wwtp toledo 1 table 1 concerning the pharmaceutical micropollutants amx was not detected in wwtp toledo 1 and 2 ihx was not detected in wwtp toledo 2 and dcf and n n diethyl meta toluamide an insect repellent deet were found only in the wwtp toledo 2 sample table s2 the variation of c p composition of wwtp toledo 1 to wwtp toledo 2 wastewater did not modify the efficiency of the biological treatment during operation macronutrients and phacs removals thus a low of phosphate content of the wastewater does not limit the performance of the advanced bio oxidation fungal treatment see table s3 the higher c n ratio of wwtp toledo 2 respect to dpp urjc 2 wastewater samples promoted a slight improvement of the toc n nh4 p po4 3 removals fig 3 a this fact is probably due to the best performance of biological fungal systems with higher c n ratios a high c n ratio mimics the optimal conditions of white rot fungi for degradation of lignin in natural lignocellulosic substrates which increases the production of lignin modifying enzymes elgueta et al 2016 rousk and bã ã th 2007 typically it is reported in literature an optimum c n ratio ranging from 7 to 10 jo et al 2010 mir tutusaus et al 2018b moreover a high c n ratio ensures the fungal growth and maintenance under non sterile conditions over bacterial populations regarding the effect of c p content there is not information reported about its influence on fungal biological systems the elimination of phacs fig 3b table s2 showed similar removals for 4 aaa cfn cpz and gfz in both wastewater samples wwtp toledo 2 and dpp urjc 2 in turn the removal of antibiotics mdz and smx slightly decreased for the wwtp toledo 2 wastewater thus it seems that the slight improvement of biological performance in terms of the toc n nh4 and p po4 3 removals is not related to a higher efficiency of the removal of pharmaceuticals however it was seen that the total content of pharmaceuticals in the wwtp toledo 2 wastewater ca 59 μg l is considerable higher than in the dpp urjc 2 wastewater ca 32 μg l taking into account these data the efficiency of the treatment for the removal of pharmaceuticals could be affected by its loading rate as it can be deduced from the overall efficiency of all the pharmaceuticals detected 59 for dpp urjc 2 versus 46 for wwtp toledo 2 likewise it must be pointed out the remarkable tolerance of the fungal treatment for the range of the pharmaceutical loadings of these two wastewaters from 317 μg d dpp urjc 2 to 590 μg d wwtp toledo 2 all the results related to the total concentration and overall removal efficiencies can be found in table s4 3 4 assessment of the prevalence of fungal or bacterial communities in the biofilm of rbcs after treatment of dpp urjc and wwtp toledo wastewaters as it has been mentioned the treatment of non sterile wastewater under continuous operation can promote the proliferation of bacterial colonies which compete for the assimilable substrates of the wastewater this fact can produce the prevalence of dominant bacterial colonies which would reduce the efficiency of the fungal advanced bio oxidation process for the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants in order to evaluate the prevalence of fungal or bacterial communities in the rbcs several bioassays with bactericides fungicide and none of them were performed using as inoculums the sludge of the biofilm of the rbcs discs after the treatment of dpp urjc 2 and wwtp toledo 2 wastewaters the consumption of sodium in terms of the toc content was used as indirect measurement of the prevalence of fungal or bacterial communities in the rbcs fig 4 a and b shows the results of the activity tests after 4 days at ph 4 5 and 7 respectively these ph values were chosen according to the ph of the inlet and outlet streams of the rbcs during treatment the profiles of the toc removal for all bioassays along the time are shown in figs s3 and s4 at ph 4 5 fig 4a the wwtp toledo 2 inoculum was more active than the dpp urjc 2 one in presence of the fungicide the wwtp toledo 2 inoculum achieved a toc removal of ca 25 in turn a negligible toc removal was observed by the dpp urjc 2 inoculum the bioassays using bactericides showed similar toc removals than that obtained by the inoculums alone even with a slight increase for the dpp urjc 2 inoculum these results clearly point to a prevalence of fungi in the dpp urjc 2 and wwtp toledo 2 inoculums at ph 7 fig 4b the dpp urjc 2 inoculum was less active in absence of fungicide and bactericides in comparison to the results at ph 4 5 this is a consequence of a more favourable ph for bacterial communities and the decelerated metabolism of fungal communities likewise the activity of bacteria when using the fungicide increased up to ca 37 and 12 for the wwtp toledo 2 and dpp urjc 2 inoculums respectively nevertheless the activity of fungi in bioassays performed with bactericides was much higher than those obtained by bacteria in those with the fungicide this confirms the prevalence of fungal communities on the biofilm of rbcs however the development of bacterial communities during the treatment of both wastewaters is also evident being more important for the inoculum of the wwtp toledo 2 treatment moreover it is observed that this inoculum displayed a slight decrease of activity for the bactericides bioassays as compared to those performed with the inoculum alone these results indicates that the higher proportion of bacteria microorganisms for this inoculum reduces the activity of both fungal and bacterial communities probably due to the competitive substrate consumption on the other hand the increase of the bacterial proportion in the inoculum of the wwtp toledo 2 could be related to the higher c n ratio of this wastewater three times higher than the dpp urjc 2 effluent summarizing and looking at the results obtained at ph 7 real ph of operation of the rbcs the bacterial communities will be contributing to the biological performance of the rbcs moreover the increasing competition of bacteria for the substrate could lead to loss of fungal biomass and the destabilization of fungal enzymes del álamo et al 2018 hai et al 2013 additionally the decrease in the fungi proportion would produce a reduction of the efficiency of phacs removal badia fabregat et al 2017 thus as the rbcs are less colonized by bacterial communities during the treatment of dpp urjc 2 a higher efficiency for phacs removal was achieved denoted by the major elimination of antibiotics the higher proportion of fungal biomass will increase the production of non selective oxidizing hydroxyl radicals through the advanced bio oxidation process enhancing the removal of more bio refractory micropollutants christoforidis et al 2018 4 conclusions the efficiency of t versicolor as white rot fungi immobilized on rotating biological contactors rbcs for the treatment of urban wastewater of different depuration facilities has been demonstrated the presence of advanced bio oxidation promoters a lignin derived mediator and metal complexes with redox activity enhanced the performance of fungal biological treatment for the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants increasing significantly the elimination of 4 aaa amx ihx and smx among others remarkable removals of the organic content ca 70 75 of toc were achieved with organic loadings between 32 and 60 mg toc h and c n and c p ratios ranging from 0 6 to 2 8 and 6 to 50 respectively these results were accomplished operating with non addition of supplementary biodegradable glucose source non fungal biomass refreshment non external aeration and 1 day of hrt which are the main limitations of fungal biological treatments for plausible implementation in wwtps it was observed the proliferation of bacteria in the biofilm of rbcs as consequence of the continuous treatment of real wastewater under non sterile conditions however the fungal communities dominate the performance of the removal of the organic loading the fungal treatment based on the immobilization of t versicolor on rbcs 10 l d in a reactor of 10 l capacity is considered an effective technology for depuration of real urban wastewaters including the removal of pharmaceutical micropollutants although further steps must be done in order to achieve a better stabilization of the fungal biomass and higher removals of nitrogen as nutrient declaration of competing interest the

18264,nutrients and pesticides in agricultural runoff contribute to the degradation of water resources nitrates and phosphates can be remediated through the use of treatment systems such as woodchip bioreactors and adsorbent aggregate filters however concerns remain over potential effects of pesticides on nutrient removal efficiency in these systems to test this we designed laboratory scale woodchip bioreactors equipped with secondary adsorbent aggregate filters and investigated the capacity of these systems to remediate nutrients when operated under two hydraulic retention times hrt and in the presence of commonly used pesticides the woodchip bioreactors effectively removed over 99 of nitrate per day when operated under a 72 h hydraulic retention time with the secondary expanded shale aggregate filters consistently reducing phosphate concentrations by 80 87 treatment efficacy of both systems was maintained in the presence of the insecticide chlorpyrifos reducing hrt in the bioreactors to 21 min decreased nitrate removal efficiency however the insecticides bifenthrin chlorpyrifos and the herbicide oxyfluorfen were reduced by 76 63 and 31 respectively cultivation approaches led to the isolation of 45 different species from the woodchip bioreactors operated under a 21 min hrt with bacillus species being the most prevalent throughout the treatment by contrast pesticide application decreased the number and diversity of bacillus isolates and enriched for pseudomonas and exiguobacterium species woodchip bioreactors and adsorbent aggregate filters provide effective treatment platforms to remediate agrochemicals where they maintain treatment efficacy in the presence of pesticides and can be modulated through hrt management to achieve environmental and operational water quality goals graphical abstract image 1 keywords bacterial community denitrification expanded shale woodchip bioreactor abbreviations blast basic local alignment tool do dissolved

a direct impact in the degradation of water resources galloway et al 2003 long et al 2011 warsaw et al 2012 nutrients from fertilizers spur eutrophication whereas pesticide residues may be released at concentrations toxic to the micro and macro biota and persist or even accumulate in the environment love et al 2011 withers et al 2014 concerns over the impact of agricultural irrigation water return flow on water quality have led to the implementation of total maximum daily loads tmdls which set thresholds for acceptable quantities of suspended solids nutrients pesticides and pathogens in agricultural water return flow herman et al 2015 hoornbeek et al 2013 majsztrik et al 2017 2018 achieving these goals requires treatment systems that reduce the agrochemical content of runoff while also being cost effective to install and maintain woodchip bioreactors have gained favor in agronomic settings as a means to remediate nitrates exported in tile drainage water christianson et al 2017 sarris and burberry 2018 these bioreactor platforms typically consist of a woodchip filled impermeably lined trench that directly receives runoff water or tile drainage for treatment christianson and schipper 2016 moorman et al 2010 nitrate removal under the loads that are common in agricultural runoff is typically driven by denitrification a microbial process that sequentially reduces nitrate to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide and finally dinitrogen n2 gas gao et al 2019 during denitrification microbial consortia use nitrate or denitrification intermediates nox as terminal electron acceptors for respiration coupling the reductive process to the oxidation of a carbon containing electron donor under anaerobic conditions greenan et al 2006 rich et al 2003 schipper et al 2010 woodchips provide a surface for the formation of microbial biofilms in the bioreactors and a readily available sustainable and inexpensive carbon source capable of lasting multiple years christianson et al 2010 coleman et al 2019 robertson and merkley 2009 the rate of nitrate remediation in the woodchip bioreactors system can be modulated by the amount of time a unit volume of water spends within the treatment system hydraulic retention time or hrt as well as temperature carbon source and nitrate content hoover et al 2016 lepine et al 2015 sarris and burberry 2018 a meta analysis conducted by addy et al 2016 indicated that bioreactor hrts below 6 h removed less nitrate when compared with longer hrts and that lower temperature coincided with reduced removal rates soupir et al 2018 reported increases in nitrate removal at 10 c from 29 to 48 and at 21 5 c from 67 to 96 when the hrt was lengthened from 12 to 24 h christianson et al 2012 used field scale bioreactors to reduce influent nitrate n o 3 loads between 12 and 76 for daily removal rates of 0 38 7 76 g n o 3 g m 3 similar to the removal rates calculated by schipper et al 2010 for field scale treatments described by jaynes et al 2008 and schipper et al 2005 with respect to water intended for irrigation return flow it would be optimal for concentrations of nitrate to not exceed the u s epa drinking water standard of 10 mg n o 3 l 1 hoover et al 2016 the capacity for woodchip bioreactors to remove phosphate p o 4 3 from agricultural runoff has also been investigated though results on their efficacy are mixed soupir et al 2018 pluer et al 2016 measured net export of phosphorus when using field scale woodchip bioreactors with highest concentrations being observed in the first year of use compared to the second year by contrast hua et al 2016 reported increased performance after 7 days of operation of woodchip bioreactors using a 24 h hrt and influent concentrations of 1 mg p o 4 3 l 1 reaching maximum removal rate of 75 on day 50 before stabilizing at 60 removal during the final 20 days of the study for an average daily removal of 0 25 g p o 4 3 m3 phosphate removal also developed over time in these bioreactors when treating higher influent concentrations of 10 mg p o 4 3 l 1 removing 1 13 mg l 1 of the phosphate over the first 20 days and 2 01 mg l 1 over the final 20 days and yielding an average removal rate of 17 4 and 0 88 g p o 4 3 m3 d 1 gottschall et al 2016 also reported woodchip bioreactors that reduced 30 of the phosphorus in influent with concentrations of 0 6 mg l 1 however woodchips amended with aluminum iron calcium based sludge from water treatment plants increased the total phosphorus removal to over 50 phosphate removal from runoff water can be achieved through sorption and precipitation processes the former being particularly suitable for the removal of the low concentrations of phosphate that are typical of agricultural runoff chouyyok et al 2013 positively charged ligands such as those found on iron oxides aluminum oxides and clay surfaces adsorb phosphate in adsorption desorption reactions that are influenced by ph ligand exchange capacity binding site availability and the presence of other ions borno et al 2018 christianson et al 2017 suggested that having separate targeted treatments for nitrate and phosphate would mitigate the issues brought forth by blending bioreactor carbon sources and phosphate adsorbing materials chiefly the removal of phosphate saturated material inconsistency in hydraulic patterns and design maintenance considerations calcined aggregates are of particular interest based on their demonstrated sorption capacity and stability when used in constructed wetlands and for their potential to be extracted and reused as a source of phosphorus fertilizer once saturated white et al 2011 aggregates that have been calcined superheated to expansion possess a larger surface area allowing more access to binding sites in addition to nitrate and phosphate agricultural runoff may also contain pesticides that need to be removed prior to irrigation return flow pesticides exhibit a range of physiochemical properties imparting characteristics which guide their fate in the environment and associated degradation processes hall et al 2015 klopffer et al 1982 hydrophobic pesticides preferentially adsorb to soils particularly the clay and organic carbon portion and may accumulate locally or be transported via erosion by contrast hydrophilic pesticides may dissolve in water allowing movement in surface runoff or leaching through the soil profile abdi and fernandez 2019 vryzas 2018 the fate of the pesticide and whether it accumulates and persists in water resources depends on its sorption and subsequent degradation in the environment arbeli and fuentes 2007 bondarenko and gan 2004 coats 1991 treatment systems to remediate pesticides from agricultural runoff may seek to sequester pesticides through the use of filters with a carbon source cederlund et al 2016 grant et al 2019 or through stimulating their microbial degradation dyguda kazimierowicz et al 2014 huang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 bioreactor woodchips may indeed serve as an adsorbent for some pesticides and could simultaneously support a robust bacterial community for their degradation camilo et al 2013 ilhan et al 2012 kourtev et al 2006 bioreactors have been shown to effectively remediate nitrate however concerns persist over the effect that pesticides and their metabolites may have on these microbially driven systems ilhan et al 2012 staley et al 2016 while some bacteria may be susceptible to the chronic and acute toxic effects of certain pesticides others can accumulate and degrade the chemicals to less harmful forms delorenzo et al 2001 muturi et al 2017 the microbial degradation of pesticides is compound dependent and repeated applications of the same chemical may be necessary to stimulate its degradation by microorganisms racke et al 1990 however pesticides particularly insecticides are often applied in mixtures of various active ingredients that can be detrimental to the resident microflora zhang et al 2018 additionally pesticide degradation products can be equally if not more detrimental to the environment and microflora than the parent compound huang et al 2018 sun et al 2019 vasileiadis et al 2018 the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos diethoxy sulfanylidene 3 5 6 trichloropyridin 2 yl oxy λ5 phosphane is one such compound as it is first degraded to tri chloro pyridinol 3 5 6 trichloro 2 pyridinol and then dechlorinated in reactions that release chlorine an effective disinfectant singh and walker 2006 assessing potentially deleterious effect that pesticides may have on bioreactors as well as the potential for remediation is therefore critical to advancing this technology to treat water contaminated with agrochemicals bioreactors can be operated to accomplish specific water treatment goals such as remediation of agrochemicals to meet environmental or drinking water standards or to reduce the presence of phytotoxic compounds in recycled irrigation water without sacrificing beneficial nutrient content consideration to the undesirable consequences of bioreactor implementation such as pollution swapping pose additional concerns addy et al 2016 coleman et al 2019 the release of nutrients from organic matter intermediates in the denitrification process and products from highly reduced bioreactors such as methylated mercury are deleterious and are directly influenced by hrt management healy et al 2015 lepine et al 2015 implementing a secondary treatment to bioreactors as part of a dual stage system may be an effective way to reduce the release of undesirable intermediates byproducts and unaddressed contaminants christianson et al 2017 here we described laboratory scale woodchip bioreactors equipped with secondary calcined aggregate reservoirs and operated under a 72 h and a 21 min hrt two separate experiments were designed to investigate the efficacy of agrochemical remediation in these treatment system the first experiment 1 evaluated nitrate remediation capacity of woodchip bioreactors under a three day hrt 2 tested the capacity of two calcined aggregates to adsorb phosphate and 3 compared the nutrient remediation capacity and water chemistry conditions present in these treatment systems when exposed to chlorpyrifos extended hrt such as the one used in this first study is often necessary for complete nitrate removal indeed hua et al 2016 measured reductions in the influent nitrate concentrations from 20 to 3 3 mg n l 1 over the first 12 h of treatment but complete removal required an additional 12 h our goal for the first study was to investigate the removal efficiency of a higher influent n o 3 concentration 80 mg l 1 thus we provided an hrt of three days the study also investigated the effect of chlorpyrifos on bioreactor performance as toxicity effects are expected from its mode of action acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and bactericidal effects of the free chlorine generated during its microbial degradation to do this we added chlorpyrifos to the simulated runoff fed to the bioreactors at a concentration 1 mg l 1 similar to its solubility in water 1 44 mg l 1 and made comparisons between bioreactors receiving the nutrient only influent and the chlorpyrifos enriched influent we also describe a second study using similar woodchip bioreactors and secondary calcined shale aggregate reservoirs operated under a 21 min hrt this study was designed to 1 assess nutrient remediation under a reduced hrt and increased loading 2 characterize the removal of chlorpyrifos as well as bifenthrin 2 methyl 3 phenylphenyl methyl 3 z 2 chloro 3 3 3 trifluoroprop 1 enyl 2 2 dimethylcyclopropane 1 carboxylate and oxyfluorfen 2 chloro 1 3 ethoxy 4 nitrophenoxy 4 trifluoromethyl benzene and 3 identify bacterial species and population dynamics present in bioreactors in response to pesticide exposure the reduced hrt was selected in order to assess the treatment efficacy of these systems under a flow rate capable of providing enough recycled water for irrigation use in addition to testing the effect of chlorpyrifos provided at 2 mg l 1 slightly above solubility concentrations we included in the study two other commonly used pesticides oxyfluorfen and bifenthrin similarly to chlorpyrifos oxyfluorfen is a chlorinated compound but its greater molecular weight may limit its biodegradability and require a longer period of microbial acclimation prior to biodegradation carboneras et al 2018 bifenthrin a synthetic pyrethroid poses a threat to aquatic life particularly fish when released into aquatic environments frank et al 2018 jin et al 2009 it also persists in soils sediments especially those with a high organic matter fraction where its affinity for sorption to solid phases may limit microbial access and biodegradation lee et al 2004 2 materials and methods studies were conducted in the greenhouses at the michigan state

comprised of 1 a woodchip bioreactor and 2 a calcined aggregate treatment with simulated runoff passing through the woodchip bioreactor first followed by the aggregate the number of replicates for each study during the nutrient only incubation stage and the post pesticide initiation stage are displayed in table 1 2 1 woodchip bioreactor expanded aggregate filter woodchip bioreactors for both

from the base of the bin with a pipe on the interior of the bin supplying water to the base of the bioreactor to a depth 18 cm below the inlet port a baffle was installed across the midpoint of the long axis through each woodchip bioreactor in the top 18 cm to reduce direct surface flow in the first study fig 1 a an identical bin was used for the calcined aggregate reservoir while in the second study fig 1b the calcined aggregate reservoir was replaced with a 10 2 cm inside diameter i d by 1 22 m long polyvinyl chloride 10 cm inside diameter schedule 40 pvc tube woodchips were comprised of a mix of hardwood species varying in size with average length width and thickness of 7 8 2 4 and 0 9 cm respectively hammond farm landscape supply east lansing mi in the first study bioreactors were supplied with 0 068 cubic meters of woodchips gently packed and shook to facilitate settling prior to addition of simulated runoff in the second study bioreactors were supplied with 0 038 cubic meters

study and 0 0125 cubic meters of expanded shale in the second study a completely randomized design was used for both studies to determine bioreactor aggregate filter location in greenhouse and influent treatment received water from the greenhouse point of connection was passed through a backflow preventer zurn wilkins 720a followed by a gpi flowmeter 2 54 cm tm series and an 80 μm mesh filter prior to the respective nutrient and pesticide injectors nutrients were supplied to the influent line through the use of an injector dosatron d45re15 before bifurcating to the dedicated nutrient only control influent line and the pesticide supplemented line pesticides were added to the simulated runoff through the use of a second injector dosatron dm11f preceded by a spring check valve to prevent treatment backflow and cross contamination the influent manifold with dedicated lines providing the desired treatment to individual bioreactor aggregate units was constructed from 2 04 cm i d pvc 1 91 cm schedule 40 pipe with every bioreactor aggregate unit having an influent control ball valve in addition to a second spring check valve 2 2 simulated runoff first study nutrient enriched simulated runoff was prepared through the use of an injection system dosatron d45re15 variable injection ratio set at 1 100 concentrated nutrient stock solutions were created bi weekly and contained 292 2 g of potassium nitrate sigma aldrich and 14 6 g of monopotassium phosphate sigma aldrich in 18 9 l of water to provide 80 mg l 1 nitrate and 1 5 mg l 1 phosphate to the bioreactor aggregate units for a daily loading rate of 1 200 mg n o 3 and 22 5 mg p o 4 3 a second injector dosatron dm11f fixed injection ratio at 1 128 was used to supplement the nutrient enriched simulated runoff with the insecticide chlorpyrifos concentrated chlorpyrifos stock solution was made every three days with 1 35 ml of lorsban 4e mixed with 11 4 l of water to provide 1 mg l 1 chlorpyrifos to

second study nutrient enriched simulated runoff was prepared through the use of the same injection system in the second study dosatron d45re15 variable injection ratio set at 1 500 during the first 34 days of the second study while all the bioreactor aggregate units were under the incubation period the nutrient influent stock solution was prepared using 303 g potassium nitrate sigma aldrich 45 g of

day 47 and the conclusion of the study day 71 2 3 hydraulic retention time management two hrts were investigated a 3 day hrt was used in the first study because hrts greater than 40 h are more effective at removing n o 3 lepine et al 2015 and it was anticipated that p o 4 3 adsorption by the aggregates would require a long hrt as well a rapid hrt of 21 min was chosen for the second study to investigate the potential for agrochemical remediation for systems requiring high throughput such as recapturing water for irrigation recycling in nursery or greenhouse container production systems the first study targeted an hrt of 3 days based on an estimated woodchip porosity of 66 78 christianson et al 2010 and 0 068 cubic meters of woodchips an average pore space of 72 was used to calculate a required daily input of 15 l to displace 1 3 of pore space water corresponding to a hydraulic retention time of 3 days in order to achieve this individual bioreactors were supplied one at a time with 15 l day individually and in the same order from 9 00 a m 12 00 p m the second study sought to identify the effects of a reduced hrt in this case 21 min with continuous water flow at a rate of 1 3 l min to each bioreactor over 8 h 8 00 a m 4 00 p m to more accurately simulate agricultural runoff each bioreactor had 0 0378 cubic meters of woodchips corresponding to 0 0272 cubic meters of pore space or 27 2 l a 1 3 l min flow rate would equal an hrt of 21 min whereas the first study was manually operated via individual rationing of influent the second study necessitated weekly calibrations of the system to ensure flow rates were consistent the calibrations were made with a graduated cylinder as the measuring device with measurements taken from the effluent port of the calcined shale filter individually operated valves on the influent line at each individual bioreactor were calibrated weekly to provide 1 3 l min with measurements taken twice weekly to ensure target flow rates were achieved bioreactors were active from 8 00 a m 4 00 p m daily with each unit receiving an average daily volume of 507 684 l 2 4 water analysis nutrients pesticides and water chemistry water samples

microbial portion of this study was to provide a rapid assessment of potential shifts in the dominant species and temporal treatment responses within woodchip bioreactors cultivation based approaches have been demonstrated to yield the denitrifying species revealed in cultivation independent processing jang et al 2019 alleviating bias against the inherent selectivity of cultivation dependent approaches furthermore our cultivation based approach allowed us to optimize our sample processing protocol in a manner where sample dispersion upon media plates could be performed without compromising biofilm cell viability 2 6 statistical analysis water chemistry nutrient and pesticide concentrations and cfu counts were subject to analysis of variance using the proc mixed procedure

data was logarithmically transformed to normalize residuals for modeling when applicable nitrate and phosphate analysis in 2017 in performing analysis of bioreactors during the incubation stages of each study all 20 bioreactors were subject to a nutrient only influent therefore analysis was conducted pre and post incubation period allowing more replications to establish baseline results prior to pesticide exposure the number of replicates for each study during the nutrient only incubation stage and the post pesticide initiation stage are displayed in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioreactor nutrient remediation in the presence of chlorpyrifos under a 3 day hrt 3 1 1 study 1 nutrient remediation in a woodchip bioreactor under a 3 day hrt nitrate nitrite and phosphate were present in the influent at 79 9 mg l 1 2 44 1 70 mg l 1 0 23 and 1 48 mg l 1 0 07 respectively throughout the duration of the study woodchip bioreactors were effective in remediating nitrate from the simulated runoff influent across all sample dates oftentimes to concentrations below the limit of detection table 2 mean concentrations of nitrite the first intermediate in denitrification were typically below detection limit 0 19 mg l 1 in effluent from the woodchip bioreactor addition of chlorpyrifos did not affect p 0 05 denitrification of nutrient enriched influent phosphate concentrations in woodchip bioreactor effluent table 2 typically were in excess of 1 mg l 1 likely reflecting adsorption desorption of existing phosphate in bioreactors as well as un attenuated influent phosphate addition of chlorpyrifos did not affect orp ph or do of woodchip bioreactor effluent fig 2 3 1 2 study 1 calcined aggregate nutrient remediation under a 3 day hrt calcined shale was effective in adsorbing phosphate from woodchip bioreactor effluent across nearly all dates in the incubation period p 0 0001 table 2 however there was no difference in phosphate concentration among any of the bioreactor calcined shale systems on day 101 likely attributed to woodchip bioreactor effluent concentrations being atypically low on this date samples collected on day 108 reflected a return to calcined shale s efficacy in remediating phosphate from woodchip bioreactor effluent differences between woodchips and shale treatments significant between p 0 0466 and p 0 026 calcined shale filters were effective in removing phosphate from woodchip effluent on day 122 nutrient only systems p 0 0033 nutrient and pesticide systems p 0 0001 and day 133 p 0 0001 on day 150 calcined shale filters reduced woodchip bioreactor effluent phosphate concentrations in pairings receiving the nutrient only influent p 0 0089 however the pesticide exposed pairings had no further reduction in phosphate concentration from woodchip bioreactor effluent p 0 05 which was attributed to the variability in phosphate concentrations exiting woodchip bioreactors under the two influent treatments nutrient only 2 13 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 85 nutrient and pesticides 0 69 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 46 calcined shale filters exposed to the two influent treatments did not differ on any given sample day post pesticide exposure p 0 05 the concentration of phosphate in calcined shale effluent did not change over time p 0 05 indicating phosphate saturation did not occur in the 150 days of the study calcined clay filters were not effective in reducing phosphate concentrations from woodchip bioreactors on any given sample date throughout the study with the exception of day 31 woodchips 1 33 mg p o 4 3 l 1

dates concentrations of phosphate present in effluent on day 10 and day 24 decreased on day 31 p 0 0001 before increasing again on day 52 p 0 0016 the elevated concentrations of phosphate in the calcined clay effluent on sample days 3 10 and 24 suggested phosphate already bound to the aggregate was desorbing providing available binding sites for phosphate to sorb on day 31 all samples collected after day 31 had phosphate concentrations in calcined clay effluent greater than 1 mg l 1 suggesting that the system had stabilized and was incapable of further adsorbing phosphate substrate analysis to determine initial bound phosphate in the two substrates found 2 mg kg of phosphate in the calcined shale and 48 mg kg of phosphate in the calcined clay corroborating the notion that after initial desorption an equilibration reaction occurred with effluent phosphate stabilizing no differences in effluent phosphate concentration were found between calcined clay filters receiving either the nutrient only or the nutrient and chlorpyrifos enriched influent with the exception of day 31 where the concentration of phosphate in the calcined clay filter effluent 0 56 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 2 and the calcined shale filter effluent 0 29 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 09 were not different p 1 00 phosphate concentrations were higher in effluent from the calcined clay filters than from the calcined shale filters on all other dates there were no differences in calcined clay effluent ph orp or d o between units receiving the nutrient only and the nutrient and chlorpyrifos enriched treatment however there were differences identified in calcined shale effluent while dissolved oxygen content was no different between calcined shale units receiving either influent on any day differences in orp and ph were identified on days 115 122 and 144 although these differences were not reflected in the capacity to sorb phosphate 3 2 bioreactor nutrient remediation in the presence of bifenthrin chlorpyrifos and oxyfluorfen under a 21 minute hrt 3 2 1 study 2 woodchip bioreactor nutrient remediation under a 21 minute hrt simulated runoff samples were analyzed for influent nutrient concentrations three times a week for a total of 53 samples collected during the incubation stage a lower influent nutrient rate was used for all bioreactors providing an average of 12 67 mg n o 3 l 1 0 33 and 0 65 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 09 followed by an increase once pesticide treatments initiated to 18 16 mg l 1 0 6 nitrate and 1 46 mg l 1 0 07 phosphate nitrate remediation was minimal during the incubation stage however effluent nitrate concentration decreased from consecutive sample dates day 6 14 67 mg n o 3 l 1 0 54 to day 13 11 98 mg n o 3 l 1 0 18 p 0 0001 table 3 nitrate concentration in bioreactor effluent had a concurrent and anticipated increase with the increased nutrient influent rate used after the incubation period ended between sample days 34 and 41 p 0 0001 similar to the incubation stage nitrate remediation appeared to be minimal when using a 21 min hrt with no differences identified between bioreactors receiving the nutrient only influent and pesticide enriched influent across all sample dates both in the incubation period and post pesticide exposure woodchip bioreactor effluent had similar or greater nitrate concentrations than influent concentrations when operated under a 21 min hrt the concentration of nitrates in woodchip bioreactors were no different between the nutrient only and the nutrient and pesticide supplemented influent treatments p 0 0775 orp do and ph values in bioreactor effluent exhibited no differences due to pesticides across all sample dates fig 3 phosphate concentrations in effluent from the woodchip bioreactor were equal to or higher than simulated

bioreactor pesticide remediation under a 21 minute hrt chlorpyrifos woodchip bioreactors reduced influent concentrations of 2 000 μg l 1 chlorpyrifos by 73 76 throughout the duration of the study without increasing over time y 1 44 x 480 9 p 0 1250 fig 4 a chlorpyrifos is a slightly water soluble compound 2 mg l 1 with high sorption potential based on reported koc values between 995 and 31 000 ncbi database https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov compound 2730 based on the consistent reduction of chlorpyrifos across all dates woodchip bioreactors appear to be a suitable filter for adsorbing this compound saturation was not observed over the course of the study suggesting sufficient binding site availability in woodchips with chlorpyrifos sequestered in bioreactors a consortium of microbial species may be able to degrade chlorpyrifos in situ and maintain treatment efficacy where john et al 2016 reported over 90 remediation under ideal conditions was possible for a consortium of bacterial species including members of the pseudomonas genus oxyfluorfen woodchip bioreactors reduced influent concentrations of oxyfluorfen by 25 30 over the first four sample dates however no reductions were found on day 62 and day 69 fig 4b oxyfluorfen concentration in woodchip bioreactor effluent increased over time y 5 37 x 323 1 p 0 0002 with maximum oxyfluorfen removal occurring on the first sample date 31 with the increase over time possibly due to the saturation of binding sites and or reduced biodegradation the reported koc of oxyfluorfen is 8 900 which indicates limited mobility in water and a high likelihood to be sorbed to organic substrates ncbi database https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov compound 39327 the increase in oxyfluorfen concentration over time indicates that the woodchips ceased to effectively bind oxyfluorfen resulting in woodchip bioreactor effluent concentrations similar to simulated runoff influent concentrations bifenthrin woodchip bioreactors reduced influent bifenthrin concentrations between 49 and 63 throughout the duration of the study with no increase in effluent concentration over time y 1 47 x 197 0 p 0 0970 fig 4c bifenthrin was expected to readily adsorb to woodchips based on reported koc values between 8 387 and 14 332 indicating a strong affinity for organic carbon ncbi database https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov compound 5281872 effluent concentration was not different between sample dates throughout the study indicating that there were sufficient binding sites for bifenthrin and or degradation processes were preventing the buildup of residues the consistent reductions in bifenthrin throughout the study suggest that woodchip bioreactors can effectively serve as a filter for binding bifenthrin with saturation not apparent at loading concentrations substantially higher than what would be expected in runoff water bifenthrin is not expected to be mobile in surface runoff however sorbed to eroded particles it may be transported downstream 3 2 3 study 2 calcined shale nutrient remediation under a 21 minute hrt under a rapid hrt with higher phosphate loading we hypothesized that calcined shale would reach saturation phosphate concentrations in calcined shale effluent were no different than the concentration received from the woodchip bioreactors across all sample dates in the incubation period p 0 05 table 3 upon initiation of pesticide treatments the phosphate concentration in the influent increased to an average of 1 46 0 07 mg p o 4 3 l 1 concurrent with this increase the effluent phosphate concentration in the calcined shale filters increased from day 34 0 72 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 05 to day 69 2 11 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 08 for the nutrient only shale filters and 2 17 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 17 for the nutrient and pesticide receiving shale filters p 0 0001 meeting or exceeding the concentration of phosphate received from the woodchip bioreactors there were no differences in effluent phosphate concentration between calcined shale filters in response to either the nutrient only influent or the nutrient and pesticide influent p 0 1842 the reduced treatment efficacy is likely attributed to the lack of sorption site phosphate anion contact time from the high flow and phosphate loading rates water chemistry parameters were not different between units receiving the nutrient only and the pesticide supplemented influent treatments fig 3 3 2 4 study 2 calcined shale pesticide remediation under a 21 minute hrt as opposed to the non ionic binding sites on woodchips charged sites on aggregates may adsorb ionic pesticides in a manner similar to phosphate adsorption dion et al 2001 sasal et al 2015 for the three pesticides investigated expanded shale aggregate filters did not reduce the concentration beyond what was received from the woodchip bioreactors fig 4 chlorpyrifos calcined shale did not reduce chlorpyrifos concentration relative to the water received from the woodchip bioreactors on any sample date p 0 05 fig 4a chlorpyrifos concentrations in calcined shale effluent increased over time y 3 08 x 419 34 p 0 0007 however comparisons made between individual dates reflected no differences in chlorpyrifos concentration between sample dates oxyfluorfen calcined shale filters did not reduce oxyfluorfen concentrations relative to the water received from woodchip bioreactors on any sample date p 0 05 the concentration of oxyfluorfen in calcined shale effluent increased over time y 7 89 x 285 6 p 0 0001 fig 4b increases in oxyfluorfen concentration in calcined shale effluent are likely reflective of the increases in received oxyfluorfen concentration from woodchip bioreactors as the woodchips effectiveness in removing oxyfluorfen declined over time bifenthrin bifenthrin concentrations were not reduced with calcined shale filters relative to the water received from woodchip bioreactors on any sample date p 0 05 the concentration of bifenthrin in calcined shale effluent increased over time y 2 99 x 157 6 p 0 0001 fig 4c 3 2 5 study 2 cultivation based analyses of microbial communities in the bioreactors biologically based treatment systems such as woodchip bioreactors rely on a consortium of microbial species to remediate contaminants from water jang et al 2019 von ahnen et al 2019 pesticides present in agricultural runoff affect the bacterial composition within treatment systems and the environment at large when exported to receiving water bodies muturi et al 2017 wang et al 2019 in an effort to assess potential shifts in numerically dominant species present in the woodchip bioreactors and the changes that may occur when exposed to pesticides microbial species from the woodchip bioreactors were harvested cultured and sequenced over the course of the second study samples were collected the day prior to pesticide treatments day 34 the day following initiation of pesticide treatments day 36 10 days following application day 47 and the final day of the experiment day 71 in total 45 different species were isolated from bioreactors across all treatments and sample dates tables 4 and 5 the taxonomic affiliation and diversity of bacterial strains recovered in pure culture from each of the samples were used as proxies of changes caused by exposure to pesticides present in agricultural runoff the bioreactor controls nutrient only permitted the isolation of 24 different species and provided a diverse profile of isolates dominated by bacillus species throughout the treatment table 4 fig 5 the most abundant species in the control bioreactors was bacillus aryabhattai a species known for its high tolerance to oxidative and nitrosative stress park et al 2017 b aryabhattai and other bacillus species were also abundant in bioreactor samples collected prior and immediately after pesticide addition but extended treatment in the presence of the pesticide shifted the isolate profile and enriched for strains in the exiguobacterium and pseudomonas genera fig 5 a total of 27 different species were recovered from these bioreactors after pesticide exposure table 5 after ten days day 47 of pesticide exposure exiguobacterium acetylicum was the most commonly sequenced species followed by b aryabhattai and then pseudomonas chlororaphis table 5 after 40 days of sustained pesticide pressure day 71 exiguobacterium was the dominant genus fig 5 although b aryabhattai and p chlororaphis were the two most commonly sequenced species table 5 species of pseudomonas are known to degrade pesticides such as isoxaben and atrazine jameson et al 2004 wenk et al 1998 and p chlororaphis strain rw71 in particular reportedly degrading halo aromatic compounds such as 1 2 3 4 tetrachloro benzene as well potrawfke et al 1998 similarly exiguobacterium aurantiacum pseudomonas pseuodoalcalcaligenes and micrococcus luteus have been studied for their potential use in the remediation of pesticides lopez et al 2005 vishnivetskaya et al 2009 studies investigating the fate of pesticides in woodchip bioreactors have generally attributed pesticide removal to sorptive processes although biodegradation may be a contributing factor ilhan et al 2011 ranaivoson et al 2019 pesticides with high sorption coefficients may be rendered immobile and be less bioavailable for transformation however under field bioreactor installations where the intended purpose is denitrification the volume of woodchips used is unlikely to become saturated with pesticides ilhan et al 2012 the concentrations of the three pesticides provided to bioreactors in the second study were higher than typically found in agricultural runoff and provided under a high daily loading rate representing an extreme scenario nevertheless chlorpyrifos and bifenthrin concentrations decreased during the experiment and oxyfluorfen removal continued until day 62 fluctuations in the influent pesticide concentrations and hydraulic loading would vary in a field installation throughout the season and may not pose the consistent sustained pesticide pressure that was provided in this study to the bioreactor microbial communities the cultivation studies illustrate the range of species present in woodchip bioreactors and highlight adaptive changes to pesticide exposure by the resident microorganisms that allow the bioreactors to remove the toxic compounds during the treatment of influent the capacity to adapt to varying contaminant pressures may allow woodchip bioreactors to maintain treatment efficacy despite changes in influent conditions 4 conclusions the results demonstrate that woodchip bioreactors equipped with adsorbent aggregate filters can reduce the export of agrochemicals in runoff water the woodchip bioreactors can be managed to remediate nitrates and pesticides based on the operating hrt whereas expanded shale aggregate can be an effective adsorbent for phosphate in the effluents extended hrts permitted nitrate remediation in the presence of pesticides however reduced hrts and increased pesticide loading rates can enrich for pesticide tolerant microbial species demonstrating the adaptability of the microbial communities in the bioreactors to influent contamination control of these variables is therefore important to operate these treatment platforms and dictate the extent of agrochemical remediation needed for specific applications selection of the locations for the treatment platform is also important if the operational intent is to minimize the impact of eutrophication inducing concentrations of nitrate and phosphate prior to off site release an extended hrt would be desirable in addition to locating treatment platforms downstream of runoff collection reservoir spillways or drainage channels bioreactors can also be used as part of a recycled irrigation water system when the goal is to reduce the phytotoxic threat of pesticide residues rather than the remediation of influent nutrients this type of application would benefit from system designs that install the woodchip bioreactors upstream of runoff collection reservoirs and passing runoff water through at a rapid flow rate as they allow for the pesticides to adsorb to the woodchips without developing the anaerobic conditions required for denitrification ultimately field scale testing will be required to scale up and manage the bioreactor designs and critical operational parameters such as hrt for the removal of nutrients pesticides and other

18264,nutrients and pesticides in agricultural runoff contribute to the degradation of water resources nitrates and phosphates can be remediated through the use of treatment systems such as woodchip bioreactors and adsorbent aggregate filters however concerns remain over potential effects of pesticides on nutrient removal efficiency in these systems to test this we designed laboratory scale woodchip bioreactors equipped with secondary adsorbent aggregate filters and investigated the capacity of these systems to remediate nutrients when operated under two hydraulic retention times hrt and in the presence of commonly used pesticides the woodchip bioreactors effectively removed over 99 of nitrate per day when operated under a 72 h hydraulic retention time with the secondary expanded shale aggregate filters consistently reducing phosphate concentrations by 80 87 treatment efficacy of both systems was maintained in the presence of the insecticide chlorpyrifos reducing hrt in the bioreactors to 21 min decreased nitrate removal efficiency however the insecticides bifenthrin chlorpyrifos and the herbicide oxyfluorfen were reduced by 76 63 and 31 respectively cultivation approaches led to the isolation of 45 different species from the woodchip bioreactors operated under a 21 min hrt with bacillus species being the most prevalent throughout the treatment by contrast pesticide application decreased the number and diversity of bacillus isolates and enriched for pseudomonas and exiguobacterium species woodchip bioreactors and adsorbent aggregate filters provide effective treatment platforms to remediate agrochemicals where they maintain treatment efficacy in the presence of pesticides and can be modulated through hrt management to achieve environmental and

a direct impact in the degradation of water resources galloway et al 2003 long et al 2011 warsaw et al 2012 nutrients from fertilizers spur eutrophication whereas pesticide residues may be released at concentrations toxic to the micro and macro biota and persist or even accumulate in the environment love et al 2011 withers et al 2014 concerns over the impact of agricultural irrigation water return flow on water quality have led to the implementation of total maximum daily loads tmdls which set thresholds for acceptable quantities of suspended solids nutrients pesticides and pathogens in agricultural water return flow herman et al 2015 hoornbeek et al 2013 majsztrik et al 2017 2018 achieving these goals requires treatment systems that reduce the agrochemical content of runoff while also being cost effective to install and maintain woodchip bioreactors have gained favor in agronomic settings as a means to remediate nitrates exported in tile drainage water christianson et al 2017 sarris and burberry 2018 these bioreactor platforms typically consist of a woodchip filled impermeably lined trench that directly receives runoff water or tile drainage for treatment christianson and schipper 2016 moorman et al 2010 nitrate removal under the loads that are common in agricultural runoff is typically driven by denitrification a microbial process that sequentially reduces nitrate to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide and finally dinitrogen n2 gas gao et al 2019 during denitrification microbial consortia use nitrate or denitrification intermediates nox as terminal electron acceptors for respiration coupling the reductive process to the oxidation of a carbon containing electron donor under anaerobic conditions greenan et al 2006 rich et al 2003 schipper et al 2010 woodchips provide a surface for the formation of microbial biofilms in the bioreactors and a readily available sustainable and inexpensive carbon source capable of lasting multiple years christianson et al 2010 coleman et al 2019 robertson and merkley 2009 the rate of nitrate remediation in the woodchip bioreactors system can be modulated by the amount of time a unit volume of water spends within the treatment system hydraulic retention time or hrt as well as temperature carbon source and nitrate content hoover et al 2016 lepine et al 2015 sarris and burberry 2018 a meta analysis conducted by addy et al 2016 indicated that bioreactor hrts below 6 h removed less nitrate when compared with longer hrts and that lower temperature coincided with reduced removal rates soupir et al 2018 reported increases in nitrate removal at 10 c from 29 to 48 and at 21 5 c from 67 to 96 when the hrt was lengthened from 12 to 24 h christianson et al 2012 used field scale bioreactors to reduce influent nitrate n o 3 loads between 12 and 76 for daily removal rates of 0 38 7 76 g n o 3 g m 3 similar to the removal rates calculated by schipper et al 2010 for field scale treatments described by jaynes et al 2008 and schipper et al 2005 with respect to water intended for irrigation return flow it would be optimal for concentrations of nitrate to not exceed the u s epa drinking water standard of 10 mg n o 3 l 1 hoover et al 2016 the capacity for woodchip bioreactors to remove phosphate p o 4 3 from agricultural runoff has also been investigated though results on their efficacy are mixed soupir et al 2018 pluer et al 2016 measured net export of phosphorus when using field scale woodchip bioreactors with highest concentrations being observed in the first year of use compared to the second year by contrast hua et al 2016 reported increased performance after 7 days of operation of woodchip bioreactors using a 24 h hrt and influent concentrations of 1 mg p o 4 3 l 1 reaching maximum removal rate of 75 on day 50 before stabilizing at 60 removal during the final 20 days of the study for an average daily removal of 0 25 g p o 4 3 m3 phosphate removal also developed over time in these bioreactors when treating higher influent concentrations of 10 mg p o 4 3 l 1 removing 1 13 mg l 1 of the phosphate over the first 20 days and 2 01 mg l 1 over the final 20 days and yielding an average removal rate of 17 4 and 0 88 g p o 4 3 m3 d 1 gottschall et al 2016 also reported woodchip bioreactors that reduced 30 of the phosphorus in influent with concentrations of 0 6 mg l 1 however woodchips amended with aluminum iron calcium based sludge from water treatment plants increased the total phosphorus removal to over 50 phosphate removal from runoff water can be achieved through sorption and precipitation processes the former being particularly suitable for the removal of the low concentrations of phosphate that are typical of agricultural runoff chouyyok et al 2013 positively charged ligands such as those found on iron oxides aluminum oxides and clay surfaces adsorb phosphate in adsorption desorption reactions that are influenced by ph ligand exchange capacity binding site availability and the presence of other ions borno et al 2018 christianson et al 2017 suggested that having separate targeted treatments for nitrate and phosphate would mitigate the issues brought forth by blending bioreactor carbon sources and phosphate adsorbing materials chiefly the removal of phosphate saturated material inconsistency in hydraulic patterns and design maintenance considerations calcined aggregates are of particular interest based on their demonstrated sorption capacity and stability when used in constructed wetlands and for their potential to be extracted and reused as a source of phosphorus fertilizer once saturated white et al 2011 aggregates that have been calcined superheated to expansion possess a larger surface area allowing more access to binding sites in addition to nitrate and phosphate agricultural runoff may also contain pesticides that need to be removed prior to irrigation return flow pesticides exhibit a range of physiochemical properties imparting characteristics which guide their fate in the environment and associated degradation processes hall et al 2015 klopffer et al 1982 hydrophobic pesticides preferentially adsorb to soils particularly the clay and organic carbon portion and may accumulate locally or be transported via erosion by contrast hydrophilic pesticides may dissolve in water allowing movement in surface runoff or leaching through the soil profile abdi and fernandez 2019 vryzas 2018 the fate of the pesticide and whether it accumulates and persists in water resources depends on its sorption and subsequent degradation in the environment arbeli and fuentes 2007 bondarenko and gan 2004 coats 1991 treatment systems to remediate pesticides from agricultural runoff may seek to sequester pesticides through the use of filters with a carbon source cederlund et al 2016 grant et al 2019 or through stimulating their microbial degradation dyguda kazimierowicz et al 2014 huang et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 bioreactor woodchips may indeed serve as an adsorbent for some pesticides and could simultaneously support a robust bacterial community for their degradation camilo et al 2013 ilhan et al 2012 kourtev et al 2006 bioreactors have been shown to effectively remediate nitrate however concerns persist over the effect that pesticides and their metabolites may have on these microbially driven systems ilhan et al 2012 staley et al 2016 while some bacteria may be susceptible to the chronic and acute toxic effects of certain pesticides others can accumulate and degrade the chemicals to less harmful forms delorenzo et al 2001 muturi et al 2017 the microbial degradation of pesticides is compound dependent and repeated applications of the same chemical may be necessary to stimulate its degradation by microorganisms racke et al 1990 however pesticides particularly insecticides are often applied in mixtures of various active ingredients that can be detrimental to the resident microflora zhang et al 2018 additionally pesticide degradation products can be equally if not more detrimental to the environment and microflora than the parent compound huang et al 2018 sun et al 2019 vasileiadis et al 2018 the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos diethoxy sulfanylidene 3 5 6 trichloropyridin 2 yl oxy λ5 phosphane is one such compound as it is first degraded to tri chloro pyridinol 3 5 6 trichloro 2 pyridinol and then dechlorinated in reactions that release chlorine an effective disinfectant singh and walker 2006 assessing potentially deleterious effect that pesticides may have on bioreactors as well as the potential for remediation is therefore critical to advancing this technology to treat water contaminated with agrochemicals bioreactors can be operated to accomplish specific water treatment goals such as remediation of agrochemicals to meet environmental or drinking water standards or to reduce the presence of phytotoxic compounds in recycled irrigation water without sacrificing beneficial nutrient content consideration to the undesirable consequences of bioreactor implementation such as pollution swapping pose additional concerns addy et al 2016 coleman et al 2019 the release of nutrients from organic matter intermediates in the denitrification process and products from highly reduced bioreactors such as methylated mercury are deleterious and are directly influenced by hrt management healy et al 2015 lepine et al 2015 implementing a secondary treatment to bioreactors as part of a dual stage system may be an effective way to reduce the release of undesirable intermediates byproducts and unaddressed contaminants christianson et al 2017 here we described laboratory scale woodchip bioreactors equipped with secondary calcined aggregate reservoirs and operated under a 72 h and a 21 min hrt two separate experiments were designed to investigate the efficacy of agrochemical remediation in these treatment system the first experiment 1 evaluated nitrate remediation capacity of woodchip bioreactors under a three day hrt 2 tested the capacity of two calcined aggregates to adsorb phosphate and 3 compared the nutrient remediation capacity and water chemistry conditions present in these treatment systems when exposed to chlorpyrifos extended hrt such as the one used in this first study is often necessary for complete nitrate removal indeed hua et al 2016 measured reductions in the influent nitrate concentrations from 20 to 3 3 mg n l 1 over the first 12 h of treatment but complete removal required an additional 12 h our goal for the first study was to investigate the removal efficiency of a higher influent n o 3 concentration 80 mg l 1 thus we provided an hrt of three days the study also investigated the effect of chlorpyrifos on bioreactor performance as toxicity effects are expected from its mode of action acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and bactericidal effects of the free chlorine generated during its microbial degradation to do this we added chlorpyrifos to the simulated runoff fed to the bioreactors at a concentration 1 mg l 1 similar to its solubility in water 1 44 mg l 1 and made comparisons between bioreactors receiving the nutrient only influent and the chlorpyrifos enriched influent we also describe a second study using similar woodchip bioreactors and secondary calcined shale aggregate reservoirs operated under a 21 min hrt this study was designed to 1 assess nutrient remediation under a reduced hrt and increased loading 2 characterize the removal of chlorpyrifos as well as bifenthrin 2 methyl 3 phenylphenyl methyl 3 z 2 chloro 3 3 3 trifluoroprop 1 enyl 2 2 dimethylcyclopropane 1 carboxylate and oxyfluorfen 2 chloro 1 3 ethoxy 4 nitrophenoxy 4 trifluoromethyl benzene and 3 identify bacterial species and population dynamics present in bioreactors in response to pesticide exposure the reduced hrt was selected in order to assess the treatment efficacy of these systems under a flow rate capable of providing enough recycled water for irrigation use in addition to testing the effect of chlorpyrifos provided at 2 mg l 1 slightly above solubility concentrations we included in the study two other commonly used pesticides oxyfluorfen and bifenthrin similarly to chlorpyrifos oxyfluorfen is a chlorinated compound but its greater molecular weight may limit its biodegradability and require a longer period of microbial acclimation prior to biodegradation carboneras et al 2018 bifenthrin a synthetic pyrethroid poses a threat to aquatic life particularly fish when released into aquatic environments frank et al 2018 jin et al 2009 it also persists in soils sediments especially those with a high organic matter fraction where its affinity for sorption to solid phases may limit microbial access and biodegradation lee et al 2004 2 materials and methods studies were conducted in the greenhouses at the michigan state university horticulture teaching and research center 3291 college rd holt mi 48842 map coordinates 42 40 23 n 84 29 04 w with the first study initiating on 10 january 2017 and concluding on 8 june 2017 and the second study initiating on 1 march 2018 and concluding on 11 may 2018 with greenhouses maintained between 20 and 22 c twenty two part water treatment units were used in each study each comprised of 1 a woodchip bioreactor and 2 a calcined aggregate treatment with simulated runoff passing through the woodchip bioreactor first followed by the aggregate the number of replicates for

from the base of the bin with a pipe on the interior of the bin supplying water to the base of the bioreactor to a depth 18 cm below the inlet port a baffle was installed across the midpoint of the long axis through each woodchip bioreactor in the top 18 cm to reduce direct surface flow in the first study fig 1 a an identical bin was used for the calcined aggregate reservoir while in the second study fig 1b the calcined aggregate reservoir was replaced with a 10 2 cm inside diameter i d by 1 22 m long polyvinyl chloride 10 cm inside diameter schedule 40 pvc tube woodchips were comprised of a mix of hardwood species varying in size with average length width and thickness of 7 8 2 4 and 0 9 cm respectively hammond farm landscape supply east lansing mi in the first study bioreactors were supplied with 0 068 cubic meters of woodchips gently packed and shook to facilitate settling prior to addition of simulated runoff in the second study bioreactors were supplied with 0 038 cubic meters of woodchips handled in the same manner two calcined aggregates were compared in the first study an expanded shale product haydite grade b majority particle size 0 95 cm digeronimo aggregates llc and a calcined non swelling illite clay turface mvp turface athletics majority particle size 2 38 mm while only the expanded shale was used in the second study the expanded shale 61 sio2 18 5 al2o3 6

study and 0 0125 cubic meters of expanded shale in the second study a completely randomized design was used for both studies to determine bioreactor aggregate filter location in greenhouse and influent treatment received water from the greenhouse point of connection was passed through a backflow preventer zurn wilkins 720a followed by a gpi flowmeter 2 54 cm tm series and an 80 μm mesh filter prior to the respective nutrient and pesticide injectors nutrients were supplied to the influent line through the use of an injector dosatron d45re15 before bifurcating to the dedicated nutrient only control influent line and the pesticide supplemented line pesticides were added to the simulated runoff through the use of a second injector dosatron dm11f preceded by a spring check valve to prevent treatment backflow and cross contamination the influent manifold with dedicated lines providing the desired treatment to individual bioreactor aggregate units was constructed from 2 04 cm i d pvc 1 91 cm schedule 40 pipe with every bioreactor aggregate unit having an influent control ball valve in addition to a second spring check valve 2 2 simulated runoff first study nutrient enriched simulated runoff was prepared through the use of an injection system dosatron d45re15 variable injection ratio set at 1 100 concentrated nutrient stock solutions were created bi weekly and contained 292 2 g of potassium nitrate sigma aldrich and 14 6 g of monopotassium phosphate sigma aldrich in 18 9 l of water to provide 80 mg l 1 nitrate and 1 5 mg l 1 phosphate to the bioreactor aggregate units for a daily loading rate of 1 200 mg n o 3 and 22 5 mg p o 4 3 a second injector dosatron dm11f fixed injection ratio at 1 128 was used to supplement the nutrient enriched simulated runoff with the insecticide chlorpyrifos concentrated chlorpyrifos stock solution was made every three days with 1 35 ml of lorsban 4e mixed with 11 4 l of water to provide 1 mg l 1 chlorpyrifos to

april 2017 day 97 after which the pesticide injector was activated starting 18 april 2017 day 98 the study was concluded on 9 june 2017 day 151 water samples from every bioreactor were collected for nutrient analysis on 7 sample dates during the incubation period days 3 10 24 31 52 80 and 97 and 5 sample dates after pesticide initiation days 101 108 122 133 and 151 water chemistry parameters

pesticide exposure nutrient influent samples were collected three times per week throughout the duration of the study with pesticide samples collected in the same manner following treatment initiation second study nutrient enriched simulated runoff was prepared through the use of the same injection system in the second study dosatron d45re15 variable injection ratio set at 1 500 during the first 34 days of the second study while all the bioreactor aggregate units were under the incubation period the nutrient influent stock solution was prepared using 303 g potassium nitrate sigma aldrich 45 g of monopotassium phosphate sigma aldrich and 30 3 l of greenhouse water mixed daily to provide 12 mg n o 3 l 1 and 0 6 mg p o 4 3 l 1 daily loading rate per bioreactor of 6 1 g n o 3 and 0 3 g p o 4 3 and once pesticide treatments began day 35 the mix increased to 467 g of potassium nitrate 80 g of monopotassium phosphate in 28 l daily to provide 18 mg n o 3 l 1 and 1 5 mg p o 4 3 l 1 daily loading rate of 9 1 g n o 3 and 0 76 g p o 4 3 three pesticides were used together to comprise the pesticide supplemented influent treatment since 1 mg l 1 chlorpyrifos had no effect on nutrient remediation in the first study the insecticide bifenthrin and herbicide oxyfluorfen were used in addition to chlorpyrifos to provide different modes of action and chemical properties the insecticides bifenthrin and chlorpyrifos and the herbicide oxyfluorfen were applied as talstar professional fmc global specialty solutions lorsban4e dow agrosciences and goaltender dow agrosciences respectively stock tanks

concluded on 4 april 2018 day 34 with 5 april 2018 day 35 being the first day for pesticide treatment the study concluded on 11 may 2018 day 71 water samples from every bioreactor were collected for nutrient analysis on 5 sample dates during the incubation period days 1 6 13 27 and 34 and 5 sample dates after pesticide initiation days 41 48 55 62 and 69 water samples for pesticide analysis were taken simultaneously in conjunction with nutrient samples on days 41 48 55 62 and 69 water chemistry parameters orp do and ph were measured on days 27 and 34 during the incubation stage and on days 41 55 62 and 69 following pesticide exposure bacterial samples were harvested from selected bioreactors the day before pesticide exposure day 34 24 h after initial exposure day 36 10 days after exposure day 47 and the conclusion of the study day 71 2 3 hydraulic retention time management two hrts were investigated a 3 day hrt was used in the first study because hrts greater than 40 h are more effective at removing n o 3 lepine et al 2015 and it was anticipated that p o 4 3 adsorption by the aggregates would require a long hrt as well a rapid hrt of 21 min was chosen for the second study to investigate the potential for agrochemical remediation for systems requiring high throughput such as recapturing water for irrigation recycling in nursery or greenhouse container production systems the first study targeted an hrt of 3 days based on an estimated woodchip porosity of 66 78 christianson et al 2010 and 0 068 cubic meters of woodchips an average pore space of 72 was used to calculate a required daily input of 15 l to displace 1 3 of pore space water corresponding to a hydraulic retention time of 3 days in order to achieve this individual bioreactors were supplied one at a time with 15 l day individually and in the same order from 9 00 a m 12 00 p m the second study sought to identify the effects of a reduced hrt in this case 21 min with continuous water flow at a rate of 1 3 l min to each bioreactor over 8 h 8 00 a m 4 00 p m to more accurately simulate agricultural runoff each bioreactor had 0 0378 cubic meters of woodchips corresponding to 0 0272 cubic meters of pore space or 27 2 l a 1 3 l min flow rate would equal an hrt of 21 min whereas the first study was manually operated via individual rationing of influent the second study necessitated weekly calibrations of the system to ensure flow rates were consistent the calibrations were made with a graduated cylinder as the measuring device with measurements taken from the effluent port of the calcined shale filter individually operated valves on the influent line at each individual bioreactor were calibrated weekly to provide 1 3 l min with measurements taken twice weekly to ensure target flow rates were achieved bioreactors were active from 8 00 a m 4 00 p m daily with each unit receiving an average daily volume of 507 684 l 2 4 water analysis nutrients pesticides and water chemistry water samples for nutrient analysis were collected weekly following both stages of the bioreactor aggregate unit by collection of 400 ml in a disposable cup oxidation reduction potential dissolved oxygen content and ph of water samples were measured upon weekly sampling events with handheld probe sensors mettler toledo left in the sample collection cup to equilibrate for 1 min prior to measurement an 8 ml sample was drawn into a 10 ml leur lock disposable polypropylene polyethylene syringe plunged through a 0 2 μm polyvinylidene fluoride filter into a 10 ml polystyrene dionex vial all thermoscientific and stored at 18 c until analysis the same process for nutrient sampling was implemented in the second study however the addition of 5 μl of anhydrous acetic acid glacial was added to stabilize sample ph water samples were only analyzed for nutrient content in the first study since we were investigating the effect chlorpyrifos may have had on nutrient remediation and not the remediation of chlorpyrifos itself water samples for pesticide analysis in the second study were collected in 1 l amber glass bottles fisher scientific in duplicate with 700 ml of sample each with 75 μl of anhydrous

any sample batches not bracketed with passing calibrations were reanalyzed after performing corrective actions sample water from bioreactors treated with bifenthrin chlorpyrifos and oxyfluorfen was extracted according to a modified version of us epa method 3510c us environmental protection agency 1996 briefly 500 ml of sample water were added to a 1000 ml teflon separatory funnel and extracted

was performed in the second study only microorganisms in the nitrate reducing woodchip bioreactors from the second study with and without pesticides were recovered in pure culture and their 16s rrna genes were sequenced and analyzed for taxonomic assignation against the national center for biotechnology information ncbi database three bioreactors from both the nutrient only influent treatment and the pesticide enriched treatment were randomly selected and sampled in triplicate on each sample date to assess potential shifts in the dominant members of the denitrifying community samples were

microbial portion of this study was to provide a rapid assessment of potential shifts in the dominant species and temporal treatment responses within woodchip bioreactors cultivation based approaches have been demonstrated to yield the denitrifying species revealed in cultivation independent processing jang et al 2019 alleviating bias against the inherent selectivity of cultivation dependent approaches furthermore our cultivation based approach allowed us to optimize our sample processing protocol in a manner where sample dispersion upon media plates could be performed without compromising biofilm cell viability 2 6 statistical analysis water chemistry nutrient and pesticide concentrations and cfu counts were subject to analysis of variance using the proc mixed procedure

data was logarithmically transformed to normalize residuals for modeling when applicable nitrate and phosphate analysis in 2017 in performing analysis of bioreactors during the incubation stages of each study all 20 bioreactors were subject to a nutrient only influent therefore analysis was conducted pre and post incubation period allowing more replications to establish baseline results prior to pesticide exposure the number of replicates for each study during the nutrient only incubation stage and the post pesticide initiation stage are displayed in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 bioreactor nutrient remediation in the presence of chlorpyrifos under a 3 day hrt 3 1 1 study 1 nutrient remediation in a woodchip bioreactor under a 3 day hrt nitrate nitrite and phosphate were present in the influent at 79 9 mg l 1 2 44 1 70 mg l 1 0 23 and 1 48 mg l 1 0 07 respectively throughout the duration of the study woodchip bioreactors were effective in remediating nitrate from the simulated runoff influent across all sample dates oftentimes to concentrations below the limit of detection table 2 mean concentrations of nitrite the first intermediate in denitrification were typically below detection limit 0 19 mg l 1 in effluent from the woodchip bioreactor addition of chlorpyrifos did not affect p 0 05 denitrification of nutrient enriched influent phosphate concentrations in woodchip bioreactor effluent table 2 typically were in excess of 1 mg l 1 likely reflecting adsorption desorption of existing phosphate in bioreactors as well as un attenuated influent phosphate addition of chlorpyrifos did not affect orp ph or do of woodchip bioreactor effluent fig 2 3 1 2 study 1 calcined aggregate nutrient remediation under a 3 day hrt calcined shale was effective in adsorbing phosphate from woodchip bioreactor effluent across nearly all dates in the incubation period p 0 0001 table 2 however there was no difference in phosphate concentration among any of the bioreactor calcined shale systems on day 101 likely attributed to woodchip bioreactor effluent concentrations being atypically low on this date samples collected on day 108 reflected a return to calcined shale s efficacy in remediating phosphate from woodchip bioreactor effluent differences between woodchips and shale treatments significant between p 0 0466 and p 0 026 calcined shale filters were effective in removing phosphate from woodchip effluent on day 122 nutrient only systems p 0 0033 nutrient and pesticide systems p 0 0001 and day 133 p 0 0001 on day 150 calcined shale filters reduced woodchip bioreactor effluent phosphate concentrations in pairings receiving the nutrient only influent p 0 0089 however the pesticide exposed pairings had no further reduction in phosphate concentration from woodchip bioreactor effluent p 0 05 which was attributed to the variability in phosphate concentrations exiting woodchip bioreactors under the two influent treatments nutrient only 2 13 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 85 nutrient and pesticides 0 69 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 46 calcined shale filters exposed to the two influent treatments did not differ on any given sample day post pesticide exposure p 0 05 the concentration of phosphate in calcined shale effluent did not change over time p 0 05 indicating phosphate saturation did not occur in the 150 days of the study calcined clay filters were not effective in reducing phosphate concentrations from woodchip bioreactors on any given sample date throughout the study with the exception of day 31 woodchips 1 33 mg p o 4 3 l 1

dates concentrations of phosphate present in effluent on day 10 and day 24 decreased on day 31 p 0 0001 before increasing again on day 52 p 0 0016 the elevated concentrations of phosphate in the calcined clay effluent on sample days 3 10 and 24 suggested phosphate already bound to the aggregate was desorbing providing available binding sites for phosphate to sorb on day 31 all samples collected after day 31 had phosphate concentrations in calcined clay effluent greater than 1 mg l 1 suggesting that the system had stabilized and was incapable of further adsorbing phosphate substrate analysis to determine initial bound phosphate in the two substrates found 2 mg kg of phosphate in the calcined shale and 48 mg kg of phosphate in the calcined clay corroborating the notion that after initial desorption an equilibration reaction occurred with effluent phosphate stabilizing no differences in effluent phosphate concentration were found between calcined clay filters receiving either the nutrient only or the nutrient and chlorpyrifos enriched influent with the exception of day 31 where the concentration of phosphate in the calcined clay filter effluent 0 56 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 2 and the calcined shale filter effluent 0 29 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 09 were not different p 1 00 phosphate concentrations were higher in effluent from the calcined clay filters than from the calcined shale filters on all other dates there were no differences in calcined clay effluent ph orp or d o between units receiving the nutrient only and the nutrient and chlorpyrifos enriched treatment however there were differences identified in calcined shale effluent while dissolved oxygen content was no different between calcined shale units receiving either influent on any day differences in orp and ph were identified on days 115 122 and 144 although these differences were not reflected in the capacity to sorb phosphate 3 2 bioreactor nutrient remediation in the presence of bifenthrin chlorpyrifos and oxyfluorfen under a 21 minute hrt 3 2 1 study 2 woodchip bioreactor nutrient remediation under a 21 minute hrt simulated runoff samples were analyzed for influent nutrient concentrations three times a week for a total of 53 samples collected during the incubation stage a lower influent nutrient rate was used for all bioreactors providing an average of 12 67 mg n o 3 l 1 0 33 and 0 65 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 09 followed by an increase once pesticide treatments initiated to 18 16 mg l 1 0 6 nitrate and 1 46 mg l 1 0 07 phosphate nitrate remediation was minimal during the incubation stage however effluent nitrate concentration decreased from consecutive sample dates day 6 14 67 mg n o 3 l 1 0 54 to day 13 11 98 mg n o 3 l 1 0 18 p 0 0001 table 3 nitrate concentration in bioreactor effluent had a concurrent and anticipated increase with the increased nutrient influent rate used after the incubation period ended between sample days 34 and 41 p 0 0001 similar to the incubation stage nitrate remediation appeared to be minimal when using a 21 min hrt with no differences identified between bioreactors receiving the nutrient only influent and pesticide enriched influent across all sample dates both in the incubation period and post pesticide exposure woodchip bioreactor effluent had similar or greater nitrate concentrations than influent concentrations when operated under a 21 min hrt the concentration of nitrates in woodchip bioreactors were no different between the nutrient only and the nutrient and pesticide supplemented influent treatments p 0 0775 orp do and ph values in bioreactor effluent exhibited no differences due to pesticides across all sample dates fig 3 phosphate concentrations in effluent from the woodchip bioreactor were equal to or higher than simulated runoff with fluctuations occurring in the incubation stage followed by an increase in effluent concentration over the span of the pesticide stage day 41 day 69 p 0 0001 3 2 2 study 2 woodchip bioreactor pesticide remediation under a 21 minute hrt chlorpyrifos woodchip bioreactors reduced influent concentrations of 2 000 μg l 1 chlorpyrifos by 73 76 throughout the duration of the study without increasing over time y 1 44 x 480 9 p 0 1250 fig 4 a chlorpyrifos is a slightly water soluble compound 2 mg l 1 with high sorption potential based on reported koc values between 995 and 31 000 ncbi database https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov compound 2730 based on the consistent reduction of chlorpyrifos across all dates woodchip bioreactors appear to be a suitable filter for adsorbing this compound saturation was not observed over the course of the study suggesting sufficient binding site availability in woodchips with chlorpyrifos sequestered in bioreactors a consortium of microbial species may be able to degrade chlorpyrifos in situ and maintain treatment efficacy where john et al 2016 reported over 90 remediation under ideal conditions was possible for a consortium of bacterial species including members of the pseudomonas genus oxyfluorfen woodchip bioreactors reduced influent concentrations of oxyfluorfen by 25 30 over the first four sample dates however no reductions were found on day 62 and day 69 fig 4b oxyfluorfen concentration in woodchip bioreactor effluent increased over time y 5 37 x 323 1 p 0 0002 with maximum oxyfluorfen removal occurring on the first sample date 31 with the increase over time possibly due to the saturation of binding sites and or reduced biodegradation the reported koc of oxyfluorfen is 8 900 which indicates limited mobility in water and a high likelihood to be sorbed to organic substrates ncbi database https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov compound 39327 the increase in oxyfluorfen concentration over time indicates that the woodchips ceased to effectively bind oxyfluorfen resulting in woodchip bioreactor effluent concentrations similar to simulated runoff influent concentrations bifenthrin woodchip bioreactors reduced influent bifenthrin concentrations between 49 and 63 throughout the duration of the study with no increase in effluent concentration over time y 1 47 x 197 0 p 0 0970 fig 4c bifenthrin was expected to readily adsorb to woodchips based on reported koc values between 8 387 and 14 332 indicating a strong affinity for organic carbon ncbi database https pubchem ncbi nlm nih gov compound 5281872 effluent concentration was not different between sample dates throughout the study indicating that there were sufficient binding sites for bifenthrin and or degradation processes were preventing the buildup of residues the consistent reductions in bifenthrin throughout the study suggest that woodchip bioreactors can effectively serve as a filter for binding bifenthrin with saturation not apparent at loading concentrations substantially higher than what would be expected in runoff water bifenthrin is not expected to be mobile in surface runoff however sorbed to eroded particles it may be transported downstream 3 2 3 study 2 calcined shale nutrient remediation under a 21 minute hrt under a rapid hrt with higher phosphate loading we hypothesized that calcined shale would reach saturation phosphate concentrations in calcined shale effluent were no different than the concentration received from the woodchip bioreactors across all sample dates in the incubation period p 0 05 table 3 upon initiation of pesticide treatments the phosphate concentration in the influent increased to an average of 1 46 0 07 mg p o 4 3 l 1 concurrent with this increase the effluent phosphate concentration in the calcined shale filters increased from day 34 0 72 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 05 to day 69 2 11 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 08 for the nutrient only shale filters and 2 17 mg p o 4 3 l 1 0 17 for the nutrient and pesticide receiving shale filters p 0 0001 meeting or exceeding the concentration of phosphate received from the woodchip bioreactors there were no differences in effluent phosphate concentration between calcined shale filters in response to either the nutrient only influent or the nutrient and pesticide influent p 0 1842 the reduced treatment efficacy is likely attributed to the lack of sorption site phosphate anion contact time from the high flow and phosphate loading rates water chemistry parameters were not different between units receiving the nutrient only and the pesticide supplemented influent treatments fig 3 3 2 4 study 2 calcined shale pesticide remediation under a 21 minute hrt as opposed to the non ionic binding sites on woodchips charged sites on aggregates may adsorb ionic pesticides in a manner similar to phosphate adsorption dion et al 2001 sasal et al 2015 for the three pesticides investigated expanded shale aggregate filters did not reduce the concentration beyond what was received from the woodchip bioreactors fig 4 chlorpyrifos calcined shale did not reduce chlorpyrifos concentration relative to the water received from the woodchip bioreactors on any sample date p 0 05 fig 4a chlorpyrifos concentrations in calcined shale effluent increased over time y 3 08 x 419 34 p 0 0007 however comparisons made between individual dates reflected no differences in chlorpyrifos concentration between sample dates oxyfluorfen calcined shale filters did not reduce oxyfluorfen concentrations relative to the water received from woodchip bioreactors on any sample date p 0 05 the concentration of oxyfluorfen in calcined shale effluent increased over time y 7 89 x 285 6 p 0 0001 fig 4b increases in oxyfluorfen concentration in calcined shale effluent are likely reflective of the increases in received oxyfluorfen concentration from woodchip bioreactors as the woodchips effectiveness in removing oxyfluorfen declined over time bifenthrin bifenthrin concentrations were not reduced with calcined shale filters relative to the water received from woodchip bioreactors on any sample date p 0 05 the concentration of bifenthrin in calcined shale effluent increased over time y 2 99 x 157 6 p 0 0001 fig 4c 3 2 5 study 2 cultivation based analyses of microbial communities in the bioreactors biologically based treatment systems such as woodchip bioreactors rely on a consortium of microbial species to remediate contaminants from water jang et al 2019 von ahnen et al 2019 pesticides present in agricultural runoff affect the bacterial composition within treatment systems and the environment at large when exported to receiving water bodies muturi et al 2017 wang et al 2019 in an effort to assess potential shifts in numerically dominant species present in the woodchip bioreactors and the changes that may occur when exposed to pesticides microbial species from the woodchip bioreactors were harvested cultured and sequenced over the course of the second study samples were collected the day prior to pesticide treatments day 34 the day following initiation of pesticide treatments day 36 10 days following application day 47 and the final day of the experiment day 71 in total 45 different species were isolated from bioreactors across all treatments and sample dates tables 4 and 5 the taxonomic affiliation and diversity of bacterial strains recovered in pure culture from each of the samples were used as proxies of changes caused by exposure to pesticides present in agricultural runoff the bioreactor controls nutrient only permitted the isolation of 24 different species and provided a diverse profile of isolates dominated by bacillus species throughout the treatment table 4 fig 5 the most abundant species in the control bioreactors was bacillus aryabhattai a species known for its high tolerance to oxidative and nitrosative stress park et al 2017 b aryabhattai and other bacillus species were also abundant in bioreactor samples collected prior and immediately after pesticide addition but extended treatment in the presence of the pesticide shifted the isolate profile and enriched for strains in the exiguobacterium and pseudomonas genera fig 5 a total of 27 different species were recovered from these bioreactors after pesticide exposure table 5 after ten days day 47 of pesticide exposure exiguobacterium acetylicum was the most commonly sequenced species followed by b aryabhattai and then pseudomonas chlororaphis table 5 after 40 days of sustained pesticide pressure day 71 exiguobacterium was the dominant genus fig 5 although b aryabhattai and p chlororaphis were the two most commonly sequenced species table 5 species of pseudomonas are known to degrade pesticides such as isoxaben and atrazine jameson et al 2004 wenk et al 1998 and p chlororaphis strain rw71 in particular reportedly degrading halo aromatic compounds such as 1 2 3 4 tetrachloro benzene as well potrawfke et al 1998 similarly exiguobacterium aurantiacum pseudomonas pseuodoalcalcaligenes and micrococcus luteus have been studied for their potential use in the remediation of pesticides lopez et al 2005 vishnivetskaya et al 2009 studies investigating the fate of pesticides in woodchip bioreactors have generally attributed pesticide removal to sorptive processes although biodegradation may be a contributing factor ilhan et al 2011 ranaivoson et al 2019 pesticides with high sorption coefficients may be rendered immobile and be less bioavailable for transformation however under field bioreactor installations where the intended purpose is denitrification the volume of woodchips used is unlikely to become saturated with pesticides ilhan et al 2012 the concentrations of the three pesticides provided to bioreactors in the second study were higher than typically found in agricultural runoff and provided under a high daily loading rate representing an extreme scenario nevertheless chlorpyrifos and bifenthrin concentrations decreased during the experiment and oxyfluorfen removal continued until day 62 fluctuations in the influent pesticide concentrations and hydraulic loading would vary in a field installation throughout the season and may not pose the consistent sustained pesticide pressure that was provided in this study to the bioreactor microbial communities the cultivation studies illustrate the range of species present in woodchip bioreactors and highlight adaptive changes to pesticide exposure by the resident microorganisms that allow the bioreactors to remove the toxic compounds during the treatment of influent the capacity to adapt to varying contaminant pressures may allow woodchip bioreactors to maintain treatment efficacy despite changes in influent conditions 4 conclusions the results demonstrate that woodchip bioreactors equipped with adsorbent aggregate filters can reduce the export of agrochemicals in runoff water the woodchip bioreactors can be managed to remediate nitrates and pesticides based on the operating hrt whereas expanded shale aggregate can be an effective adsorbent for phosphate in the effluents extended hrts permitted nitrate remediation in the presence of pesticides however reduced hrts and increased pesticide loading rates can enrich for pesticide tolerant microbial species demonstrating the adaptability of the microbial communities in the bioreactors to influent contamination control of these variables is therefore important to operate these treatment platforms and dictate the extent of agrochemical remediation needed for specific applications selection of the locations for the treatment platform is also important if the operational intent is to minimize the impact of eutrophication inducing concentrations of nitrate and phosphate prior to off site release an extended hrt would be desirable in addition to locating treatment platforms downstream of runoff collection reservoir spillways or drainage channels bioreactors can also be used as part of a recycled irrigation water system when the goal is to reduce the phytotoxic threat of pesticide residues rather than the remediation of influent nutrients this type of application would benefit from system designs that install the woodchip bioreactors upstream of runoff collection reservoirs and passing runoff water through at a rapid flow rate as they allow for the pesticides to adsorb to the woodchips without developing the anaerobic conditions required for denitrification ultimately field scale testing will be required to scale up and manage the bioreactor designs and critical operational parameters such as hrt for the removal of nutrients pesticides and other
