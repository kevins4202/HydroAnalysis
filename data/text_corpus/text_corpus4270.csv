21350,in this paper collision avoidance ca scheme for unmanned surface vehicles usvs under complex shallow sea environments which contain static sea surface static undersea obstacles uo and surface island with reefs ir is proposed the main challenge of this paper is that ca objects not only include surface obstacles uo and ir but more importantly they will be affected by dynamic water level it is difficult if not impossible to employ conventional ca schemes for usvs the salient features of the proposed scheme are 1 a uo model which incorporates time varying water level is developed 2 the smoothing edge se method of island of ir that is based on fuzzy gauss mixture model is enhanced by introducing fuzzy membership to gaussian mixture model 3 a real time collision probability rtcp algorithm under ir with time varying water level which obeys the poisson and gauss distribution is developed by combining the uo fmm and the se rtcp the proposed ca scheme is able to handle uncertainties in complex shallow sea environments comparative studies with the state of the art demonstrate that the proposed ca scheme is superior in terms of safety and yaw cost consumption keywords collision avoidance undersea obstacle fast marching method smoothing edge real time collision probability time varying water level 1 introduction due to the widespread applications of unmanned surface vehicles usvs many researchers have focused on advanced technologies pertaining to usvs in recent years sun et al 2020 liu et al 2019a zadeh et al 2017 cheng and zhang 2018 peng et al 2013 thakur et al 2012 in this context path planning strategies for usvs especially ca methods under complex ocean environments whose constraints encompass simultaneous disturbances due to random water level have received great attention over the years currently with the development of advanced sensors and artificial intelligence technology usvs can not only generate global path autonomously but also make an emergency response in real time by capturing dynamic local environment information these technologies are capable of making usvs perform ocean surface tasks autonomously an example of such a case is shown in fig 1 which represents a water quality monitoring mission in a shallow water area including inland island and underwater obstacles the dots represent the multiple water quality monitoring stations where the critical sampling data such as pollutant content water level are stored stations are located in the shallow water areas which requires the usv to safely visit these stations with the minimal costs such as the minimum traversal distance and the least yaw energy consumption when the path predefined by the electronic chart is not effective due to the dynamic ocean environment liu and lu 2013 in this context in order to visit these stations it makes sense to study the ca scheme for real world ocean environments previous works pertaining to path planning methods have mainly focused on global approaches whereby heuristic algorithms such as the a algorithm are popular in yap 2002 the iterative deepening a algorithm has been proposed to determine the number of surrounding points and it yields the best possible path unfortunately the improvement of the a approach was not suitable for usv navigation in order to circumvent this problem numerous improved algorithms for the a method have been reported yan et al 2011 stentz 1995 ferguson and stentz 2006 phanthong et al 2014 daniel et al 2010 in yan et al 2011 in order to avoid redundant calculations of traditional a method some adjacent points were combined to avoid unnecessary back and forth motion in stentz 1995 and ferguson and stentz 2006 an improved a algorithm with its extensions has been proposed to reduce computation burden by optimizing the path at arbitrary positions meanwhile by modifying the a method in phanthong et al 2014 the ca problem considering uos was solved by the best first search method that employed the heuristic cost estimation method to re plan the low computation cost path in daniel et al 2010 the variant of a method namely theta was proposed to smooth the path nevertheless these variants of the a algorithm focused on path planning under static environments and were insensitive to large scale environments with time varying water level unlike the aforementioned path planning methods ca problem is mainly solved by the evolutionary algorithm which has three categories namely genetic algorithm kim et al 2017 kanakakis and tsourveloudis 2007 leigh et al 2007 ant colony optimization vinay and sridharan 2012 chen et al 2013 wu et al 2017 and particle swarm optimization roberge et al 2013 li et al 2006 by virtue of the sub optimal problems of evolutionary algorithm variants of these foregoing algorithms were proposed unfortunately optimization of the path length convergence and consistency of the planning results still cannot be guaranteed in order to circumvent the real world problems various studies on the artificial potential field apf have been reported in huang et al 2020 an improved apf which used to assign different potential functions to different obstacles was designed and a driven environment was assigned resistance values in each edge of obstacles by virtue of the dynamic apf algorithm real time collision free paths were generated for uavs in dynamic environment in du et al 2020 based on a binary bayes filter the apf can produce the safety path for auv by low cost sensors in unknown environments in noguchi and maki 2019 in albaghdadi and ali 2019 a novel apf has worked on online collision free paths for each robot in a crowded environment however it should be highlighted that all variants of the apf algorithm suffer a major drawback in the convergence process i e local minimum problem in the literatures of path planning the safety in unknown environments is a basic indicator for robots in dai et al 2019 in order to generate the safety path an improved rrt algorithm based on sampling was proposed however obtaining dynamic information about obstacles can generate a safer ca path in order to generate excellent path in complex environment many improved algorithms have been reported in yu et al 2019 fu et al 2019 liu et al 2019b in yu et al 2019 a framework of the surface water environment with unknown domains was established by the grid method an improved rrt was proposed for fusing the data of underwater environment with undulating terrain and scattered floating obstacles in fu et al 2019 based on the ant colony algorithm and clustering algorithm a novel ca method which is suitable for the complex ocean environment was designed in liu et al 2019b in dynamic environment collision assessment is also important in li et al 2019 based on fifth order bezier curve a path planning method was designed to avoid sudden obstacle after being evaluated in jing et al 2019 once the distance between the robot and the obstacle was less than a certain threshold value the random parameters were used to adjust the moving direction so that the robot can avoid collision however for some special environments more precise path planning methods are needed in irani et al 2018 a localizability constraint based path planning method was proposed to solve the positioning error due to special environment a simplifying model of special environment was proposed by using a delaunay triangulation in wheare et al 2019 inspired by the aforementioned methods to special environment fusion the special ocean environment especially the dynamic water level need to be extracted for usv considering the path energy consumption some studies have proposed improvements in energy constraint and energy prediction in wai and prasetia 2019 sharma et al 2019 liu and bucknall 2016 especially in liu and bucknall 2016 the yaw energy of path played an important role hence the yaw rate limitation in a dynamic environment is a problem to be solved from the above analysis the apf is easily affected by the local minimum problem while the rrt method is not suitable for dynamic path planning because it cannot provide global optimal solution although some measures can improve these disadvantages these measures may increase the computational burden because additional algorithms are added on the contrary the path generated by fast marching method fmm will only have a global minimum point which is located at the starting point with a potential value of 0 therefore using the combined fmm can solve many practical problems the fmm characterized by simulated electromagnetic wave propagation that starts from the original point was proposed in liu and bucknall 2015 basically the arrival time can be regarded as the potential value in this context the original point of propagation can be set as the goal point so that local minima can be avoided in garrido et al 2006 the fmm has been used to obtain the shortest path on the safest area generated by the voronoi diagram in wang et al 2018 an fmm based path planning scheme with an additional minimization step was proposed to solve a multi objective variational optimization problem in order to reduce the computation burden a modified fmm to solve multi player differential problem called the reach avoid game was proposed in zhou et al 2018 in liu and bucknall 2018 song et al 2017 a new propagation scale limit was introduced into fmm to reflect the influence of obstacles such as island and coastline however due to the time varying water level the generated paths can only guarantee sub optimal solutions without considering dynamic and unknown influence of special ocean environmental such as the reefs around island for ease of reference we have summarized the literatures mentioned in this paper in table 1 in this paper we focus on the unresolved issues in the above literatures which revolve around how to solve the ca scheme in the static uo and ir for usvs that are sensitive to environmental factors in order to avoid various uos a shallow sea environment structure for analyzing the relationship between obstacles and water level is designed by fusing environment data derived from sensors to reflect influence on usvs by combining with the fmm a novel ca scheme is proposed to visit water quality monitoring stations under shallow sea environment unlike the previous approaches the proposed ca scheme not only estimates special environments but also generates suitable paths for usvs the rest of this paper is organized as follow in section 2 problem formulation is briefly presented in section 3 the novel ca scheme for visiting stations in complex shallow sea environments structure is proposed simulation results and comparative studies in complex shallow sea environments are presented in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 problem formulation in this section the complex shallow sea area e x includes marine static domain e s t a t i c underwater obstacle domain e u o and island with reef domain e i r where x x y represents the position in e x that is as follows 1 e x e s t a t i c e u o e i r where e s t a t i c includes reachable domain e r and unreachable domain e u r in addition to e r and e u r e i r and e u o are sensitive to water level l which changes around the average water level l in this context the ca scheme is as follows 2 c a c a i e i r l c a u e u o l in order to ensure safety during ca we define the yellow safety area with radius r as shown in fig 2 which is not allowed to enter any obstacles and r should be slightly larger than half of the length of usv to ensure that the distance between obstacles and usv is out of safety range to be more specific this safety constraint is governed by 3 c r s x y s o b s r where s denotes the position when the obstacles enter this area the usv begins to avoid collision as shown in fig 3 during ca turning will generate yaw energy e c a due to the accumulation of ϕ hence e c a should be minimized by limiting ϕ 4 ϕ i a r c t a n s i y s i 1 y s i x s i 1 x ϕ i 1 a r c t a n s i 1 y s i 2 y s i 1 x s i 2 x ϕ i ϕ i ϕ i 1 e c a i 1 n ϕ i c ϕ m i n e c a the main objective of this paper is to develop a ca algorithm for usv visiting stations in e x the following aims of the ca scheme should have good results in terms of length security and e c a 5 a u c a i c r a i c a u c r c ϕ in addition we have listed the variables symbols and abbreviations in table 2 for the sake of readability 3 collision avoidance in shallow sea environment in this section an ca scheme for visiting water quality monitoring stations is proposed by both designing shallow sea environments and generating ca paths simultaneously 3 1 shallow sea environments 3 1 1 static division to divide e r and e u r the gray degree of entire map μ is generated by processing the degrees of color r g and b from the image sensor on the usv a data map μ can be expressed as follows 6 μ x y α r x y β g x y γ b x y where α β γ are the weights of these colors in addition there are two initialization cluster centers μ 1 and μ 2 with e r and e u r 7 μ 1 e r μ 2 e u r and the average cluster centers μ are obtained by updating with k means clustering algorithm the main function is expressed as follow 8 μ 1 μ 2 a r g m i n μ i 2 μ x y μ μ x y μ i in order to clearly segment e s t a t i c we set the gray value of e r and e u r to 255 and 0 respectively 9 μ x y 0 μ x y φ 255 μ x y φ where φ is a threshold that is equal to μ 1 μ 2 2 here we have 10 e u r μ x y 0 e r μ x y 255 3 1 2 uo area e u o is characterized by 11 e u o h 0 l h m a x q h χ where h is the height of the uo with the seabed height χ and q is the function of e u o we have 12 q x y χ h x y r a n d where rand is the random increment of uo height due to the corrosion or adhesion in zhang et al 2018 the fluctuation of l is caused by waves and the gaussian functions are used to represent water level by wave height hence we assume that the rising and falling of l obey gaussian distribution φ because the speed of usv is fast so in e u o the fluctuation of l has little influence on the navigation of usv as shown in fig 4 combining with current l and uos attributes enables us to obtain the distance between uo and the bottom of the usv and a safe path is formed in e u o remark1 under normal circumstances the local and attribute information of uos are obtained through side scan sonar and artificial exploration the former can intuitively provide the shape and position of obstacles and the latter can confirm the attributes of known obstacles 3 1 3 ir area in e i r the distance between the reefs and the bottom of the ship is relatively short and navigation is more sensitive to changes in water level based on the above l analysis we assume that the factors of e i r are characterized by 13 p l p d l p l φ l σ 2 l l l m l l n where the discrete l obeys poisson distribution and l m and l n are two adjacent values in l as shown in fig 5 l has the highest probability of occurring under the scope σ which is σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 σ 4 the larger the value of σ is the bigger the change range of l is combined with a certain p m a x shown in fig 5 each l corresponds to the normal safe distance sd between the usv and the edge of the island in the form of gaussian distribution as shown in fig 6 based on eq 13 figs 5 and 6 e i r is shown in fig 7 remark2 the water level monitoring method was developed by qingqing et al 2019 wei and he 2016 using intel realsense d435 stereo camera as shown in fig 8 a 3 2 ca schemes in this section we propose the novel real time ca algorithm for visiting stations in e u o and e i r 3 2 1 uo area we use the fmm which simulates the propagation process of e x by solving the eikonal equation to generate path this equation is governed by 14 t x y v x y 1 where t x y is the arrival time of x y from the starting point t of the starting point is equal to 0 and v represents the propagation speed in e x combining with fig 4 the values of v of e u o are as follows 15 l l 0 v u o 0 v χ 1 l 0 l l 1 v u o k 0 l h δ h δ l l l 1 v χ 1 where l 0 and l 1 are conversion boundaries and k 0 is obstacle coefficient in addition to the interpolation l h δ h and δ l also affect the ca results the illustration of propagation process with fmm is presented in fig 9 where the blue area represents e x d x and d y are the horizontal and vertical variations respectively and the red and green points denote the neighbor points the values of t x and t y are represented by 16 t x m i n t x d x y t x d x y t y m i n t x y d y t x y d y the solutions to eq 14 can be written as 17 t x y t x 1 v x y t y i n f t x y t y 1 v x y t x i n f t x y t x d x 2 t x y t y d y 2 v x y 2 we can obtain v by obtaining s h and l and get t by combining eq 17 finally we achieve a u through the direction of gradient descent the pseudocode of ca in e u o is shown in algorithm 1 in the appendix remark3 due to the frequent wave the computing efficiency and draft of usv will be affected in shallow water area hence the usv needs to install ultra low power microcontroller such as stm32 l4 series in fig 8b moreover in sahalan et al 2016 a mechanical bar measure method was considered as the depth measurement tool that can get rid of draft factor in shallow water area 3 2 2 ir area it turns out that in order to achieve a i during usv navigation in e i r solving c ϕ plays a critical part in general the ca path is along the edge of obstacle hence the obstacle detection in wang et al 2017 can directly affect the effectiveness of ca moreover the smoothing edge se of the island is effective method to solve c ϕ the gaussian mixture model in ju and liu 2012 was powerful tool that estimates and recognizes the position data of obstacles the probability density at the obstacle position data is governed by 18 p s ω i 1 n θ i p i s ω i 19 p i s ω i 1 2 π γ δ i e x ϑ i t δ i 1 s ϑ i 2 where s denotes the position of obstacle points set n is the number of data θ i is the weight of the ith single gaussian model γ is the data dimension ϑ i denotes the center of the obstacle δ i is the covariance matrix and ω i contains ϑ i and δ i the function of the gaussian mixture model is to estimate ω by utilizing maximum likelihood method with the log likelihood function f s ω 20 f s ω l o g i k p x i ω i 21 ω ˆ a r g m a x ω f s ω the above parameters are updated by the expectation maximization algorithm governed by 22 ϕ i n e w t n p i s t ω 23 θ i n e w φ i n e w n 24 ϑ i n e w t n p i s t ω s t ϕ i n e w 25 δ i n e w t 1 n p i s t ω s t ϑ i n e w s t ϑ i n e w t ϕ i n e w adapting from the fuzzy c means the fuzzy membership has been incorporated into the expectation maximization process to increase the calculation speed adopting the following dissimilarity function 26 f i t 2 1 θ i p s i ω ϑ i t is obtained as follows 27 ϑ i t 1 j 1 k f i t f j t 2 m 1 combined eq 26 with eq 27 ϑ i n e w is expressed as follows 28 ϑ i n e w θ i p i s t ω m m 1 i 1 k θ i p i s t ω 1 m 1 m where m is the degree of fuzziness accordingly the new method of updating of the gaussian mixture model parameters is as follows 29 θ i n e w t 1 n ϑ i t m i 1 k t 1 n ϑ i t m 30 ϑ i n e w t 1 n ϑ i t m s t t 1 n ϑ i t m 31 δ i n e w t 1 n ϑ i t m s t ϑ i n e w s t ϑ i n e w t t 1 n ϑ i t m after the iteration process the obstacle shape is estimated to be an ellipse with the center ϑ i and the axis is determined by δ i hence in c ϕ the ca can reduces e c a by the se method in order to achieve a i with real time ca we propose a novel real time ca algorithm based on following real time collision probability rtcp algorithm 32 p l e l l l l 33 c i n d e x k 1 p l d i s l where c i n d e x denotes the collision index which is used to generate the initial ca path k 1 is the collision factor and d i s l denotes distance between usv s current position and the nearest edge of reefs because the approximated probability can be either smaller or larger than the exact probability we choose p l p l and d i s l d i s l combining eq 17 with eq 33 we obtain the path point cost p o i n t c o s t as follows 34 p o i n t c o s t a ε m c i n d e x b t where a and b are the weights of the collision and arrival time respectively that satisfy a b 1 and ε denotes the incremental coefficient that prevents invalid initial ca path considering sd which is depicted in fig 6 dis between the path point and edge of the island should be greater or equal to the minimum safe distance s d 0 hence the criterion for our selection of valid path points is as follows 35 p m a x p d l t s d 0 φ 1 p m a x σ s d s d 0 where p m a x that is obtained by poisson distribution is the maximum probability in gaussian distribution we use the b spline method to connect the path segments that obtained by real time screening of valid path points to achieve a i and the usv can reach station successfully the real time ca algorithm based on se rtcp in e i r is shown in algorithm 2 in the appendix remark4 note that the number of valid path points for each path segment is limited because l changes in real time and the original parameters are no longer adapted to the new environment hence once a path segment is generated the parameters of environment need to be updated since the environment changes regularly in a short time in order to facilitate the generation of paths we set the number of effective path points of each path segment to n remark5 in order to reduce the calculation time when the distance between the path point and the ending point is equal to d it can be regarded as successfully reaching the ending point so the value of d should be small enough we assume that d is equal to r remark6 the fuzzy gaussian mixture model can perform attribute analysis on the main area of obstacle but the relatively prominent part of the obstacle is isolated outside the boundary so that the obstacle shape still cannot be accurately represented by the contour line so this may be a hazard for collision avoidance strategy hence we need to adjust the estimated boundary corresponding to this part the main method is to connect the center to these boundary points respectively then re correct the position of the boundary points along the extension line direction and finally get a new contour line that can completely surround the obstacle remark7 in liu and bucknall 2016 the importance of energy of yaw rate is also reflected and security is the main part of this ca scheme which is also one of the key problems to be solved however the se does not guarantee optimization of path length and efficiency in particular since the path is constantly corrected in the dynamic sea environment the length criterion cannot be fully guaranteed otherwise it will lead to dangerous situations such as rock collision 4 simulation results and discussions in this section the effectiveness and superiority of the path planning technology in e x including e s t a t i c e u o and e i r will be demonstrated in fig 10 e x is originated from a certain sea area in dalian the simulation of this area is conducted on matlab platform using windows 7 environment over inter core i5 6500 processor with a speed of 3 2 ghz and 8 gb ram the k means clustering method is used to classify e x affected by time varying l whereby the principal parameters are set as follows the weights α β γ 1 3 the low cluster center μ 1 0 and the high cluster center μ 2 255 since the unit size of e x is 1 d x and d y are set to 1 the usv has the length of 1 19 m and r d 0 7 m the camera sampling frequency used is f 1 7 10 5 h z i e 1 7 10 5 raw data points are sampled per second from it after filtering and down sampling we utilized a total of 9009 points to estimate l simulation studies are carried out in the following two parts namely shallow water area in time varying characteristics and ca scheme in this area 4 1 shallow water environments 4 1 1 static area based on the color degree α β γ and μ the division results of e s t a t i c by k means clustering method are shown in fig 11 whereby e s t a t i c is distinguished by black and white which denote e u r and e r respectively 4 1 2 uo area combining with eqs 11 and 12 in fig 10 the simulation parameters of e u o are chosen as follows χ 0 05 r a n d 0 05 r a n d n x y h x y 1 2 e x 1 2 y 2 2 0 7 e x 2 2 y 1 2 the three dimension 3d and top view of e u o are presented in fig 12 4 1 3 ir area according to e i r in fig 10 these simulation parameters directly indicate a certain environment and affect the scope of navigation of the usv along the coastline the current water level l changes around the average water level l and the magnitude of the change is represented by σ in fig 5 in order to show the effectiveness of the simulation in a certain marine environment we set these initial parameters l l and σ to 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 the characteristics of l and l are shown in fig 13 4 2 collision avoidance ca scheme 4 2 1 static area in e s t a t i c 300 50 is the start point 1000 300 and 850 800 are the positions of water quality monitoring stations as shown in fig 14 the paths of a algorithm have some redundant turns while the paths of theta algorithm avoid redundant turns by reselecting the parent nodes during the replanning process however the fmm can directly generate the smooth paths without re planning compared with the other two methods fmm has the shortest computation time in fig 15 4 2 2 uo area as shown in fig 12 the yellow areas are high obstacles and the green areas are low obstacles and the blue area is in er we choose the following parameters k 0 0 1 l 0 0 28 l 1 0 3 in order to verify the safety of a u at different l we set l to 0 28 0 29 0 30 0 31 and the ca paths generated by uo fmm are shown in fig 16 as shown in fig 16a l is the lowest and equal to l 0 hence according to eq 15 v of high and low obstacles are equal to 0 so that these obstacles have adverse effect on the usv and usv can avoids them in fig 16b and c these values of l satisfy the second formula in eq 15 hence the influence of uo especially the low obstacles gradually decreases with l increasing and the usv can safely navigate near the low obstacles in fig 16d the value of l exceeds l 1 since v 1 usv can pass through them directly without being affected by low obstacles 4 2 3 ir area in e i r although the collision cost is an important factor for usv s safe navigation the ultimate task of a i is to reach the station hence we set the value of a to be less than b the parameters of real time ca are chosen as follows k 1 1 a 0 1 b 0 9 since the path length generated by fmm is 263 7345 m and the unit size is 1 m hence considering the sd to filter the path points we set n to 12 so that the number of simulation loops is less than 30 to improve the simulation efficiency as shown in fig 17 compared with the static path with fmm the ca path obtained by using rtcp to fuse data of e i r in fig 10 is safer furthermore we consider se of the island as shown in fig 18 the island has two obstacle parts whose centers are 0 15 0 1 and 0 15 0 2 their size ratio is 1 1 specifically we set the avoiding parameters ω of the fuzzy gaussian mixture model as follows 36 ω ϑ 1 0 15 0 1 0 15 0 2 δ 1 1 1 1 1 according to eqs 18 31 we obtain the new shape of the obstacle with ω by non fuzzy and fuzzy approach as shown in fig 18 which demonstrate that fig 18b is closer to the shape of the obstacles and the number of iterations is smaller by using fuzzy approaches however the upper left and upper right areas in fig 18b are isolated hence in fig 18c we have corrected these boundaries according to remark 6 because se will expand the shape of the obstacle so decreasing the influence range of obstacles will optimize the length of the path on the contrary without se increasing the influence range of obstacles will ensure the safety of navigation therefore as shown in fig 19 the se rtcp path is closer to the island than that of rtcp which not only ensures the safety of usv but also reduces the path length in addition fig 20 demonstrates that the path generated by se rtcp are smoother than that generated by rtcp if fmm is used in e i r whenever the environment changes the entire environment needs to be analyzed again on the contrary the workspace proportion of se rtcp is small so the computational efficiency of fmm is lower than sertcp we set the computational efficiency to be 10 30 percent as low efficiency 30 60 percent as medium efficiency and 60 100 percent as high efficiency the comparison results of these methods are summarized in table 3 as shown in table 3 we can see that although dis of fmm is small it is only suitable for static environment and once the environment changes the computation efficiency becomes low and security can not be guaranteed in e i r both rtcp and se rtcp can complete ca under dynamic environment but e c a of se rtcp is smaller than rtcp hence the proposed se rtcp is able to avoid collision in e i r while the fmm and rtcp are inferior in terms of safety and energy consumption respectively 5 conclusions in this paper two types of ca namely se rtcp and uo fmm under dynamic shallow sea conditions have been proposed to be more specific a novel ca scheme for the shallow sea environments including ir and uo model affected by time varying water level has been developed the proposed uo fmm that is used to generate safe path by describing the influence of uo domain has been proposed the se rtcp that is used to generate real time path by estimating collision probability has been proposed comprehensive and comparative simulation studies with dynamic water level in shallow water area demonstrate that the uo fmm and se rtcp are more accurate and are superior to the fmm and rtcp however some existing drawbacks of the current approach are 1 the gaussian mixture model is very dependent on the integrity of information points of obstacles 2 the se rtcp cannot optimize the path length and calculation efficiency well 3 repeated calculations in frequent waves result in large power consumption using the ca scheme hence in subsequent research we will further research on relevant hardware such as intel realsense d435 stereo camera and stm32 l4 series ultra low power microcontroller so as to ensure the integrity of obstacle information and improve computation efficiency in addition improving the accuracy of bathymetric survey and water level monitoring method to ensure the navigation safety of usv in shallow water is also an essential link to verify the practicability of ca scheme declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

island with reefs ir is proposed the main challenge of this paper is that ca objects not only include surface obstacles uo and ir but more importantly they will be affected by dynamic water level it is difficult if not impossible to employ conventional ca schemes for usvs the salient features of the proposed scheme are 1 a uo model which incorporates time varying water level is developed 2 the smoothing edge se method of island of ir that is based on fuzzy gauss mixture model is enhanced by introducing fuzzy membership to gaussian mixture model 3 a real time collision probability rtcp algorithm under ir with time varying water level which obeys the poisson and gauss distribution is developed by combining the uo fmm and the se rtcp the proposed ca scheme is able to handle uncertainties in complex shallow sea environments comparative studies with the state of the art demonstrate that the proposed ca scheme is superior in terms of safety and yaw cost consumption keywords collision avoidance undersea obstacle fast marching method smoothing edge real time collision probability time varying water level 1 introduction due to the widespread applications of unmanned surface vehicles usvs many researchers have focused on advanced technologies pertaining to usvs in recent years sun et al 2020 liu et al 2019a zadeh et al 2017 cheng and zhang 2018 peng et al 2013 thakur et al 2012 in this context path planning strategies for usvs especially ca methods under complex ocean environments whose constraints encompass simultaneous disturbances due to random water level have received great attention over the years currently with the development of advanced sensors and artificial intelligence technology usvs can not only generate global path autonomously but also make an emergency response in real time by capturing dynamic local environment information these technologies are capable of making usvs perform ocean surface tasks autonomously an example of such a case is shown in fig 1 which represents a water quality monitoring mission in a shallow water area including inland island and underwater obstacles the dots represent the multiple water quality monitoring stations where the critical sampling data such as pollutant content water level are stored stations are located in the shallow water areas which requires the usv to safely visit these stations with the minimal costs such as the minimum traversal distance and the least yaw energy consumption when the path predefined by the electronic chart is not effective due to the dynamic ocean environment liu and lu 2013 in this context in order to visit these stations it makes sense to study the ca scheme for real world ocean environments previous works pertaining to path planning methods have mainly focused on global approaches whereby heuristic algorithms such as the a algorithm are popular in yap 2002 the iterative deepening a algorithm has been proposed to determine the number of surrounding points and it yields the best possible path unfortunately the improvement of the a approach was not suitable for usv navigation in order to circumvent this problem numerous improved algorithms for the a method have been reported yan et al 2011 stentz 1995 ferguson and stentz 2006 phanthong et al 2014 daniel et al 2010 in yan et al 2011 in order to avoid redundant calculations of traditional a method some adjacent points were combined to avoid unnecessary back and forth motion in stentz 1995 and ferguson and stentz 2006 an improved a algorithm with its extensions has been proposed to reduce computation burden by optimizing the path at arbitrary positions meanwhile by modifying the a method in phanthong et al 2014 the ca problem considering uos was solved by the best first search method that employed the heuristic cost estimation method to re plan the low computation cost path in daniel et al 2010 the variant of a method namely theta was proposed to smooth the path nevertheless these variants of the a algorithm focused on path planning under static environments and were insensitive to large scale environments with time varying water level unlike the aforementioned path planning methods ca problem is mainly solved by the evolutionary algorithm which has three categories namely genetic algorithm kim et al 2017 kanakakis and tsourveloudis 2007 leigh et al 2007 ant colony optimization vinay and sridharan 2012 chen et al 2013 wu et al 2017 and particle swarm optimization roberge et al 2013 li et al 2006 by virtue of the sub optimal problems of evolutionary algorithm variants of these foregoing algorithms were proposed unfortunately optimization of the path length convergence and consistency of the planning results still cannot be guaranteed in order to circumvent the real world problems various studies on the artificial potential field apf have been reported in huang et al 2020 an improved apf which used to assign different potential functions to different obstacles was designed and a driven environment was assigned resistance values in each edge of obstacles by virtue of the dynamic apf algorithm real time collision free paths were generated for uavs in dynamic environment in du et al 2020 based on a binary bayes filter the apf can produce the safety path for auv by low cost sensors in unknown environments in noguchi and maki 2019 in albaghdadi and ali 2019 a novel apf has worked on online collision free paths for each robot in a crowded environment however it should be highlighted that all variants of the apf algorithm suffer a major drawback in the convergence process i e local minimum problem in the literatures of path planning the safety in unknown environments is a basic indicator for robots in dai et al 2019 in order to generate the safety path an improved rrt algorithm based on sampling was proposed however obtaining dynamic information about obstacles can generate a safer ca path in order to generate excellent path in complex environment many improved algorithms have been reported in yu et al 2019 fu et al 2019 liu et al 2019b in yu et al 2019 a framework of the surface water environment with unknown domains was established by the grid method an improved rrt was proposed for fusing the data of underwater environment with undulating terrain and scattered floating obstacles in fu et al 2019 based on the ant colony algorithm and clustering algorithm a novel ca method which is suitable for the complex ocean environment was designed in liu et al 2019b in dynamic environment collision assessment is also important in li et al 2019 based on fifth order bezier curve a path planning method was designed to avoid sudden obstacle after being evaluated in jing et al 2019 once the distance between the robot and the obstacle was less than a certain threshold value the random parameters were used to adjust the moving direction so that the robot can avoid collision however for some special environments more precise path planning methods are needed in irani et al 2018 a localizability constraint based path planning method was proposed to solve the positioning error due to special environment a simplifying model of special environment was proposed by using a delaunay triangulation in wheare et al 2019 inspired by the aforementioned methods to special environment fusion the special ocean environment especially the dynamic water level need to be extracted for usv considering the path energy consumption some studies have proposed improvements in energy constraint and energy prediction in wai and prasetia 2019 sharma et al 2019 liu and bucknall 2016 especially in liu and bucknall 2016 the yaw energy of path played an important role hence the yaw rate limitation in a dynamic environment is a problem to be solved from the above analysis the apf is easily affected by the local minimum problem while the rrt method is not suitable for dynamic path planning because it cannot provide global optimal solution although some measures can improve these disadvantages these measures may increase the computational burden because additional algorithms are added on the contrary the path generated by fast marching method fmm will only have a global minimum point which is located at the starting point with a potential value of 0 therefore using the combined fmm can solve many practical problems the fmm characterized by simulated electromagnetic wave propagation that starts from the original point was proposed in liu and bucknall 2015 basically the arrival time can be regarded as the potential value in this context the original point of propagation can be set as the goal point so that local minima can be avoided in garrido et al 2006 the fmm has been used to obtain the shortest path on the safest area generated by the voronoi diagram in wang et al 2018 an fmm based path planning scheme with an additional minimization step was proposed to solve a multi objective variational optimization problem in order to reduce the computation burden a modified fmm to solve multi player differential problem called the reach avoid game was proposed in zhou et al 2018 in liu and bucknall 2018 song et al 2017 a new propagation scale limit was introduced into fmm to reflect the influence of obstacles such as island and coastline however due to the time varying water level the generated paths can only guarantee sub optimal solutions without considering dynamic and unknown influence of special ocean environmental such as the reefs around island for ease of reference we have summarized the literatures mentioned in this paper in table 1 in this paper we focus on the unresolved issues in the above literatures which revolve around how to solve the ca scheme in the static uo and ir for usvs that are sensitive to environmental factors in order to avoid various uos a shallow sea environment structure for analyzing the relationship between obstacles and water level is designed by fusing environment data derived from sensors to reflect influence on usvs by combining with the fmm a novel ca scheme is proposed to visit water quality monitoring stations under shallow sea environment unlike the previous approaches the proposed ca scheme not only estimates special environments but also generates suitable paths for usvs the rest of this paper is organized as follow in section 2 problem formulation is briefly presented in section 3 the novel ca scheme for visiting stations in complex shallow sea environments structure is proposed simulation results and comparative studies in complex shallow sea environments are presented in section 4 conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 problem formulation in this section the complex shallow sea area e x includes marine static domain e s t a t i c underwater obstacle domain e u o and island with reef domain e i r where x x y represents the position in e x that is as follows 1 e x e s t a t i c e u o e i r where e s t a t i c includes reachable domain e r and unreachable domain e u r in addition to e r and e u r e i r and e u o are sensitive to water level l which changes around the average water level l in this context the ca scheme is as follows 2 c a c a i e i r l c a u e u o l in order to ensure safety during ca we define the yellow safety area with radius r as shown in fig 2 which is not allowed to enter any obstacles and r should be slightly larger than half of the length of usv to ensure that the distance between obstacles and usv is out of safety range to be more specific this safety constraint is governed by 3 c r s x y s o b s r where s denotes the position when the obstacles enter this area the usv begins to avoid collision as shown in fig 3 during ca turning will generate yaw energy e c a due to the accumulation of ϕ hence e c a should be minimized by limiting ϕ 4 ϕ i a r c t a n s i y s i 1 y s i x s i 1 x ϕ i 1 a r c t a n s i 1 y s i 2 y s i 1 x s i 2 x ϕ i ϕ i ϕ i 1 e c a i 1 n ϕ i c ϕ m i n e c a the main objective of this paper is to develop a ca algorithm for usv visiting stations in e x the following aims of the ca scheme should have good results in terms of length security and e c a 5 a u c a i c r a i c a u c r c ϕ in addition we have listed the variables symbols and abbreviations in table 2 for the sake of readability 3 collision avoidance in shallow sea environment in this section an ca scheme for visiting water quality monitoring stations is proposed by both designing shallow sea environments and generating ca paths simultaneously 3 1 shallow sea environments 3 1 1 static division to divide e r and e u r the gray degree of entire map μ is generated by processing the degrees of color r g and b from the image sensor on the usv a data map μ can be expressed as follows 6 μ x y α r x y β g x y γ b x y where α β γ are the weights of these colors in addition there are two initialization cluster centers μ 1 and μ 2 with e r and e u r 7 μ 1 e r μ 2 e u r and the average cluster centers μ are obtained by updating with k means clustering algorithm the main function is expressed as follow 8 μ 1 μ 2 a r g m i n μ i 2 μ x y μ μ x y μ i in order to clearly segment e s t a t i c we set the gray value of e r and e u r to 255 and 0 respectively 9 μ x y 0 μ x y φ 255 μ x y φ where φ is a threshold that is equal to μ 1 μ 2 2 here we have 10 e u r μ x y 0 e r μ x y 255 3 1 2 uo area e u o is characterized by 11 e u o h 0 l h m a x q h χ where h is the height of the uo with the seabed height χ and q is the function of e u o we have 12 q x y χ h x y r a n d where rand is the random increment of uo height due to the corrosion or adhesion in zhang et al 2018 the fluctuation of l is caused by waves and the gaussian functions are used to represent water level by wave height hence we assume that the rising and falling of l obey gaussian distribution φ because the speed of usv is fast so in e u o the fluctuation of l has little influence on the navigation of usv as shown in fig 4 combining with current l and uos attributes enables us to obtain the distance between uo and the bottom of the usv and a safe path is formed in e u o remark1 under normal circumstances the local and attribute information of uos are obtained through side scan sonar and artificial exploration the former can intuitively provide the shape and position of obstacles and the latter can confirm the attributes of known obstacles 3 1 3 ir area in e i r the distance between the reefs and the bottom of the ship is relatively short and navigation is more sensitive to changes in water level based on the above l analysis we assume that the factors of e i r are characterized by 13 p l p d l p l φ l σ 2 l l l m l l n where the discrete l obeys poisson distribution and l m and l n are two adjacent values in l as shown in fig 5 l has the highest probability of occurring under the scope σ which is σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 σ 4 the larger the value of σ is the bigger the change range of l is combined with a certain p m a x shown in fig 5 each l corresponds to the normal safe distance sd between the usv and the edge of the island in the form of gaussian distribution as shown in fig 6 based on eq 13 figs 5 and 6 e i r is shown in fig 7 remark2 the water level monitoring method was developed by qingqing et al 2019 wei and he 2016 using intel realsense d435 stereo camera as shown in fig 8 a 3 2 ca schemes in this section we propose the novel real time ca algorithm for visiting stations in e u o and e i r 3 2 1 uo area we use the fmm which simulates the propagation process of e x by solving the eikonal equation to generate path this equation is governed by 14 t x y v x y 1 where t x y is the arrival time of x y from the starting point t of the starting point is equal to 0 and v represents the propagation speed in e x combining with fig 4 the values of v of e u o are as follows 15 l l 0 v u o 0 v χ 1 l 0 l l 1 v u o k 0 l h δ h δ l l l 1 v χ 1 where l 0 and l 1 are conversion boundaries and k 0 is obstacle coefficient in addition to the interpolation l h δ h and δ l also affect the ca results the illustration of propagation process with fmm is presented in fig 9 where the blue area represents e x d x and d y are the horizontal and vertical variations respectively and the red and green points denote the neighbor points the values of t x and t y are represented by 16 t x m i n t x d x y t x d x y t y m i n t x y d y t x y d y the solutions to eq 14 can be written as 17 t x y t x 1 v x y t y i n f t x y t y 1 v x y t x i n f t x y t x d x 2 t x y t y d y 2 v x y 2 we can obtain v by obtaining s h and l and get t by combining eq 17 finally we achieve a u through the direction of gradient descent the pseudocode of ca in e u o is shown in algorithm 1 in the appendix remark3 due to the frequent wave the computing efficiency and draft of usv will be affected in shallow water area hence the usv needs to install ultra low power microcontroller such as stm32 l4 series in fig 8b moreover in sahalan et al 2016 a mechanical bar measure method was considered as the depth measurement tool that can get rid of draft factor in shallow water area 3 2 2 ir area it turns out that in order to achieve a i during usv navigation in e i r solving c ϕ plays a critical part in general the ca path is along the edge of obstacle hence the obstacle detection in wang et al 2017 can directly affect the effectiveness of ca moreover the smoothing edge se of the island is effective method to solve c ϕ the gaussian mixture model in ju and liu 2012 was powerful tool that estimates and recognizes the position data of obstacles the probability density at the obstacle position data is governed by 18 p s ω i 1 n θ i p i s ω i 19 p i s ω i 1 2 π γ δ i e x ϑ i t δ i 1 s ϑ i 2 where s denotes the position of obstacle points set n is the number of data θ i is the weight of the ith single gaussian model γ is the data dimension ϑ i denotes the center of the obstacle δ i is the covariance matrix and ω i contains ϑ i and δ i the function of the gaussian mixture model is to estimate ω by utilizing maximum likelihood method with the log likelihood function f s ω 20 f s ω l o g i k p x i ω i 21 ω ˆ a r g m a x ω f s ω the above parameters are updated by the expectation maximization algorithm governed by 22 ϕ i n e w t n p i s t ω 23 θ i n e w φ i n e w n 24 ϑ i n e w t n p i s t ω s t ϕ i n e w 25 δ i n e w t 1 n p i s t ω s t ϑ i n e w s t ϑ i n e w t ϕ i n e w adapting from the fuzzy c means the fuzzy membership has been incorporated into the expectation maximization process to increase the calculation speed adopting the following dissimilarity function 26 f i t 2 1 θ i p s i ω ϑ i t is obtained as follows 27 ϑ i t 1 j 1 k f i t f j t 2 m 1 combined eq 26 with eq 27 ϑ i n e w is expressed as follows 28 ϑ i n e w θ i p i s t ω m m 1 i 1 k θ i p i s t ω 1 m 1 m where m is the degree of fuzziness accordingly the new method of updating of the gaussian mixture model parameters is as follows 29 θ i n e w t 1 n ϑ i t m i 1 k t 1 n ϑ i t m 30 ϑ i n e w t 1 n ϑ i t m s t t 1 n ϑ i t m 31 δ i n e w t 1 n ϑ i t m s t ϑ i n e w s t ϑ i n e w t t 1 n ϑ i t m after the iteration process the obstacle shape is estimated to be an ellipse with the center ϑ i and the axis is determined by δ i hence in c ϕ the ca can reduces e c a by the se method in order to achieve a i with real time ca we propose a novel real time ca algorithm based on following real time collision probability rtcp algorithm 32 p l e l l l l 33 c i n d e x k 1 p l d i s l where c i n d e x denotes the collision index which is used to generate the initial ca path k 1 is the collision factor and d i s l denotes distance between usv s current position and the nearest edge of reefs because the approximated probability can be either smaller or larger than the exact probability we choose p l p l and d i s l d i s l combining eq 17 with eq 33 we obtain the path point cost p o i n t c o s t as follows 34 p o i n t c o s t a ε m c i n d e x b t where a and b are the weights of the collision and arrival time respectively that satisfy a b 1 and ε denotes the incremental coefficient that prevents invalid initial ca path considering sd which is depicted in fig 6 dis between the path point and edge of the island should be greater or equal to the minimum safe distance s d 0 hence the criterion for our selection of valid path points is as follows 35 p m a x p d l t s d 0 φ 1 p m a x σ s d s d 0 where p m a x that is obtained by poisson distribution is the maximum probability in gaussian distribution we use the b spline method to connect the path segments that obtained by real time screening of valid path points to achieve a i and the usv can reach station successfully the real time ca algorithm based on se rtcp in e i r is shown in algorithm 2 in the appendix remark4 note that the number of valid path points for each path segment is limited because l changes in real time and the original parameters are no longer adapted to the new environment hence once a path segment is generated the parameters of environment need to be updated since the environment changes regularly in a short time in order to facilitate the generation of paths we set the number of effective path points of each path segment to n remark5 in order to reduce the calculation time when the distance between the path point and the ending point is equal to d it can be regarded as successfully reaching the ending point so the value of d should be small enough we assume that d is equal to r remark6 the fuzzy gaussian mixture model can perform attribute analysis on the main area of obstacle but the relatively prominent part of the obstacle is isolated outside the boundary so that the obstacle shape still cannot be accurately represented by the contour line so this may be a hazard for collision avoidance strategy hence we need to adjust the estimated boundary corresponding to this part the main method is to connect the center to these boundary points respectively then re correct the position of the boundary points along the extension line direction and finally get a new contour line that can completely surround the obstacle remark7 in liu and bucknall 2016 the importance of energy of yaw rate is also reflected and security is the main part of this ca scheme which is also one of the key problems to be solved however the se does not guarantee optimization of path length and efficiency in particular since the path is constantly corrected in the dynamic sea environment the length criterion cannot be fully guaranteed otherwise it will lead to dangerous situations such as rock collision 4 simulation results and discussions in this section the effectiveness and superiority of the path planning technology in e x including e s t a t i c e u o and e i r will be demonstrated in fig 10 e x is originated from a certain sea area in dalian the simulation of this area is conducted on matlab platform using windows 7 environment over inter core i5 6500 processor with a speed of 3 2 ghz and 8 gb ram the k means clustering method is used to classify e x affected by time varying l whereby the principal parameters are set as follows the weights α β γ 1 3 the low cluster center μ 1 0 and the high cluster center μ 2 255 since the unit size of e x is 1 d x and d y are set to 1 the usv has the length of 1 19 m and r d 0 7 m the camera sampling frequency used is f 1 7 10 5 h z i e 1 7 10 5 raw data points are sampled per second from it after filtering and down sampling we utilized a total of 9009 points to estimate l simulation studies are carried out in the following two parts namely shallow water area in time varying characteristics and ca scheme in this area 4 1 shallow water environments 4 1 1 static area based on the color degree α β γ and μ the division results of e s t a t i c by k means clustering method are shown in fig 11 whereby e s t a t i c is distinguished by black and white which denote e u r and e r respectively 4 1 2 uo area combining with eqs 11 and 12 in fig 10 the simulation parameters of e u o are chosen as follows χ 0 05 r a n d 0 05 r a n d n x y h x y 1 2 e x 1 2 y 2 2 0 7 e x 2 2 y 1 2 the three dimension 3d and top view of e u o are presented in fig 12 4 1 3 ir area according to e i r in fig 10 these simulation parameters directly indicate a certain environment and affect the scope of navigation of the usv along the coastline the current water level l changes around the average water level l and the magnitude of the change is represented by σ in fig 5 in order to show the effectiveness of the simulation in a certain marine environment we set these initial parameters l l and σ to 0 3 0 2 and 0 1 the characteristics of l and l are shown in fig 13 4 2 collision avoidance ca scheme 4 2 1 static area in e s t a t i c 300 50 is the start point 1000 300 and 850 800 are the positions of water quality monitoring stations as shown in fig 14 the paths of a algorithm have some redundant turns while the paths of theta algorithm avoid redundant turns by reselecting the parent nodes during the replanning process however the fmm can directly generate the smooth paths without re planning compared with the other two methods fmm has the shortest computation time in fig 15 4 2 2 uo area as shown in fig 12 the yellow areas are high obstacles and the green areas are low obstacles and the blue area is in er we choose the following parameters k 0 0 1 l 0 0 28 l 1 0 3 in order to verify the safety of a u at different l we set l to 0 28 0 29 0 30 0 31 and the ca paths generated by uo fmm are shown in fig 16 as shown in fig 16a l is the lowest and equal to l 0 hence according to eq 15 v of high and low obstacles are equal to 0 so that these obstacles have adverse effect on the usv and usv can avoids them in fig 16b and c these values of l satisfy the second formula in eq 15 hence the influence of uo especially the low obstacles gradually decreases with l increasing and the usv can safely navigate near the low obstacles in fig 16d the value of l exceeds l 1 since v 1 usv can pass through them directly without being affected by low obstacles 4 2 3 ir area in e i r although the collision cost is an important factor for usv s safe navigation the ultimate task of a i is to reach the station hence we set the value of a to be less than b the parameters of real time ca are chosen as follows k 1 1 a 0 1 b 0 9 since the path length generated by fmm is 263 7345 m and the unit size is 1 m hence considering the sd to filter the path points we set n to 12 so that the number of simulation loops is less than 30 to improve the simulation efficiency as shown in fig 17 compared with the static path with fmm the ca path obtained by using rtcp to fuse data of e i r in fig 10 is safer furthermore we consider se of the island as shown in fig 18 the island has two obstacle parts whose centers are 0 15 0 1 and 0 15 0 2 their size ratio is 1 1 specifically we set the avoiding parameters ω of the fuzzy gaussian mixture model as follows 36 ω ϑ 1 0 15 0 1 0 15 0 2 δ 1 1 1 1 1 according to eqs 18 31 we obtain the new shape of the obstacle with ω by non fuzzy and fuzzy approach as shown in fig 18 which demonstrate that fig 18b is closer to the shape of the obstacles and the number of iterations is smaller by using fuzzy approaches however the upper left and upper right areas in fig 18b are isolated hence in fig 18c we have corrected these boundaries according to remark 6 because se will expand the shape of the obstacle so decreasing the influence range of obstacles will optimize the length of the path on the contrary without se increasing the influence range of obstacles will ensure the safety of navigation therefore as shown in fig 19 the se rtcp path is closer to the island than that of rtcp which not only ensures the safety of usv but also reduces the path length in addition fig 20 demonstrates that the path generated by se rtcp are smoother than that generated by rtcp if fmm is used in e i r whenever the environment changes the entire environment needs to be analyzed again on the contrary the workspace proportion of se rtcp is small so the computational efficiency of fmm is lower than sertcp we set the computational efficiency to be 10 30 percent as low efficiency 30 60 percent as medium efficiency and 60 100 percent as high efficiency the comparison results of these methods are summarized in table 3 as shown in table 3 we can see that although dis of fmm is small it is only suitable for static environment and once the environment changes the computation efficiency becomes low and security can not be guaranteed in e i r both rtcp and se rtcp can complete ca under dynamic environment but e c a of se rtcp is smaller than rtcp hence the proposed se rtcp is able to avoid collision in e i r while the fmm and rtcp are inferior in terms of safety and energy consumption respectively 5 conclusions in this paper two types of ca namely se rtcp and uo fmm under dynamic shallow sea conditions have been proposed to be more specific a novel ca scheme for the shallow sea environments including ir and uo model affected by time varying water level has been developed the proposed uo fmm that is used to generate safe path by describing the influence of uo domain has been proposed the se rtcp that is used to generate real time path by estimating collision probability has been proposed comprehensive and comparative simulation studies with dynamic water level in shallow water area demonstrate that the uo fmm and se rtcp are more accurate and are superior to the fmm and rtcp however some existing drawbacks of the current approach are 1 the gaussian mixture model is very dependent on the integrity of information points of obstacles 2 the se rtcp cannot optimize the path length and calculation efficiency well 3 repeated calculations in frequent waves result in large power consumption using the ca scheme hence in subsequent research we will further research on relevant hardware such as intel realsense d435 stereo camera and stm32 l4 series ultra low power microcontroller so as to ensure the integrity of obstacle information and improve computation efficiency in addition improving the accuracy of bathymetric survey and water level monitoring method to ensure the navigation safety of usv in shallow water is also an essential link to verify the practicability of ca scheme declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

establishing this heuristic regarded equation on a firm theoretical ground the drag force is clearly seen to be originating from the advective acceleration and the skin friction resistance which is not explicitly represented in morison s equation is viewed as a small part of the drag force for the special case of constant flow velocity the general expression is employed to derive a resistance formula for ships the viscous term is handled through the use of prandtl kármán formulation of friction drag due to a turbulent boundary layer conflict between froude and reynolds scaling is reconciled by allowing a deviation from the true partition of the corresponding forces but ensuring in return the correct scaling of the total resistance force for the model and ship the performance of the resistance formula is checked against the experimental measurements of various ship forms finally formulas for forces due to a current at an angle to a ship are suggested keywords wave and current forces inertia drag and frictional forces morison s equation ship resistance 1 introduction estimation of forces acting on an object moving in fluid or fixed in space but subjected to a flow field has always been of a major interest to engineers froude froude and froude 1888 made the first comprehensive and practical treatment of ship resistance and set the tone for further research on this subject as to the wave forces acting on a fixed object the work of morison o brien johnson and scaaf morison et al 1950 in 1950 which resulted in the formulation known briefly as the morison equation may be referred to as pioneering and most widely used one despite its popularity this formulation has been regarded as a heuristic expression combining the inertia and drag forces indeed the paper opens by simply stating the formulation without embarking on any justifying argument the total force exerted by surface waves is simply pronounced as composed of a virtual mass force and a drag force this distinct separation and subsequent addition of these different contributions have often been questioned sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 spm 1984 here it is not only observed clearly that these two forces essentially stem from the same source but also their addition is naturally dictated by the momentum equation itself furthermore a third contribution arising from the frictional effects is identified and expressed in terms of mean flow velocity as formulated by prandtl and kármán independently prandtl and tietjens 1957 p 75 based on blasius s law of pressure drop for turbulent flows blasius 1911 this frictional term however is assessed to be negligible or at most accountable as a part of drag force for marine structures with wetted surface areas not appreciably greater than frontal projection areas a ship resistance formula is developed by dismissing the incident wave field completely and taking only a constant current in the general expression describing combined wave and current forces for ship like vessels the wetted surface area is considerably greater than the frontal projection area hence the skin friction drag cannot be neglected therefore the inertia drag term whose coefficient is manipulated through newtonian arguments and the skin friction term are kept together in establishing a formula for the resistance of ships the well known problem of the froude versus reynolds scaling is resolved in a fundamental way by sacrificing the true partition of these forces but gaining the correct scaling of the total resistance force several surface ships and a submarine are considered for testing the predictive capabilities of the resistance formula formulas for estimating the inline and lateral forces acting on a ship in presence of a current at an angle are also suggested in closing 2 derivation of a general force expression from 1 d momentum equation an object partially immersed in fluid and piercing above the free surface is considered as shown in fig 1 for the sake of generality the breadth b z and length l z of the object are varying functions of the vertical coordinate z likewise the bottom of the object is not necessarily sitting on the bed an incident flow velocity u x z t which may be unsteady and vertically varying impinges on the body in the x direction only the momentum equation for 1 d flow is 1 ρ u t ρ u u x p x τ y x y where ρ is the fluid density u the velocity in the x direction p the pressure and τ y x the shearing stress acting in the x direction normal to the y direction as the flow is taken one dimensional the velocity components v and w are tacitly set to zero by assuming their contribution negligible in accord with froude krylov hypothesis as evoked in morison et al 1950 multiply 1 by the volume element d v d x d y d z and integrate over the object in the x and y directions to get 2 b z 2 b z 2 l z 2 l z 2 p x d x d y d z b z 2 b z 2 l z 2 l z 2 ρ u t d x d y d z b z 2 b z 2 l z 2 l z 2 ρ 2 u 2 x d x d y d z l z 2 l z 2 b z 2 τ y x y d y d x d z l z 2 l z 2 b z 2 τ y x y d y d x d z where the last two integrals over the left and right semi surfaces of the object indicate the frictional drag due to shearing stresses acting on the entire surface area of the object they are identical for an object with x z plane symmetry carrying out the integrals results in 3 p b p f b z d z ρ u r t b z l z d z ρ 2 u b 2 u f 2 b z d z l z 2 l z 2 τ y x τ y x b z 2 d x d z l z 2 l z 2 τ y x τ y x b z 2 d x d z where the subscripts b and f stand respectively for the back and front of the object as aligned in the x direction when the flow is in the positive x direction the front side pressure p f is greater than the back side pressure p b hence p f p b is positive for a reversed flow direction it is obviously negative area element on the front face of the pile b z d z is the projected area element d a p z b z d z of the object facing incident flow then p f p b d a p z indicates the net differential force acting on an infinitesimal height d z of the pile namely d f f f f b d z which may be positive or negative depending on the flow direction fluid acceleration u r t in the vicinity of the object is calculated by using a representative flow velocity u r which for practical purposes is related to the incident flow velocity by u r c m u since the accelerative force is associated with the added or virtual mass of moving body the constant c m may be viewed as an added mass coefficient the symbol c m is especially taken to correspond to the mass or inertia coefficient used in morison et al 1950 b z l z d z is no other than the infinitesimal volume element b z l z d z d v so that the mass force ρ c m u t d v is proportional to the submerged mass ρ v of the body the second term on the right of eq 3 is the so called drag force component of the morison equation it is probably more appropriate to name this term inertia drag or dynamic pressure drag as termed in prandtl and tietjens prandtl and tietjens 1957 p 86 95 in order to express this component in terms of the incident velocity the difference u b 2 u f 2 should be related to u 2 by a proportionality factor say c d again as used in morison et al 1950 writing then u b 2 u f 2 c d u 2 gives 1 2 ρ c d u 2 d a p z for the pressure drag per infinitesimal height d z this term is advective acceleration and it would be wrong to consider the virtual mass force ρ c m u t d v as ρ c m u t u u x d v to account for total acceleration of the flow field as argued in the relevant literature it is equally wrong to state that the linearised acceleration is used for the flow by taking u t alone this misconception arises because the origin of the drag force as given by morison et al 1950 could not be traced to the field acceleration u u x before with the aid of the present derivation it should be clear that re introducing u u x besides u t in the mass force is erroneous such an attempt as investigated in 14 p 457 reveals a baffling result because the correct way of treating u u x is to treat it as pressure drag proportional to the frontal projected area of the object using the total acceleration ρ u t u u x for computing inertia force and then adding this to the drag force which is shown to be arising from ρ u u x is obviously an inconsistent repetition the last two integrals in eq 3 represent the frictional force acting on the outer surface of the object the shearing stresses far away from the surface τ y x and τ y x vanish as the flow field becomes uniform to proceed with the integrals the shearing stresses on either side of the underwater body surface τ y x b z 2 and τ y x b z 2 must be specified based on the pressure drop formula of blasius 1911 from experiments with turbulent flows prandtl and kármán independent of each other derived the following expression for the shearing stress on a flat plate 4 τ 0 0 0288 ρ u 2 ν u 1 5 1 x 5 where subscript 0 denotes the surface value u is the undisturbed flow velocity x the distance in the lengthwise or flow direction along the plate and ν μ ρ the kinematic viscosity using τ 0 both for τ y x b z 2 and τ y x b z 2 integrating along the length of the object l z gives 5 2 l z 2 l z 2 τ 0 d x d z 0 072 r e 5 1 2 ρ u 2 c z d z where r e u l z ν is the reynolds number reynolds 1884 computed using the length l z in the flow direction x and c z 2 b z l z the perimeter of the object at a height z it results from the integration of both sides of the object in the x direction by taking into account the protrusion in the y direction thus circumscribing the cross section at height z integral c z d z s w gives the wetted surface area or the underwater surface area of the object note that the frictional force for turbulent flow is not proportional to u 2 but u 9 5 u 1 8 when the 1 5 th power of velocity in denominator is taken out letting l z l eq 5 can be rearranged as 0 036 ρ l ν 5 s w u 1 8 which is strikingly similar to r e froude s frictional resistance formula r f f s w u 1 825 with f being a coefficient which depends on the waterline length of the ship rawson and tupper 2001 p 699 also these two formulas yield quite comparable quantitative results it is possible to use a different shear stress formulation for turbulent flow such as ittc attc hughes or granville as listed in lewis lewis 1988 p 12 nevertheless the present work adheres to the prandtl kármán formula as it has a solid theoretical and experimental background now that each contribution in eq 2 has been expressed in terms of the incident velocity u a general expression for the horizontal force d f in the x direction per infinitesimal height d z can be written as 6 d f ρ c m u t d v z 1 2 ρ c d u 2 d a p z 1 2 ρ c f u 2 c z d z where c f 0 072 α f r e 5 is the friction coefficient with an additional constant α f which like c m and c d is introduced to compensate variations in the flow velocity and o 1 for flat plates α f can simply be set to unity a quite important detail concerning the appropriate use of the above formula must be mentioned the inertia terms the first two terms scale according to the froude number while the remaining friction term scales according to the reynolds number if eq 6 is to give consistent results for a model and its full scale a correction factor must be introduced to the reynolds number in the friction term in 6 this problem is resolved by a formal analysis and then demonstrated for a container ship in 6 1 3 waves and currents combined by assuming that the linear superposition principle holds the flow field u may be specified as composed of two different contributions a steady current u c z which depends only on the vertical coordinate z such as a logarithmic profile and an unsteady incident wave field u w x z t thus letting u u c z u w x z t in 6 gives 7 d f ρ c m u w t d v z 1 2 ρ c d u c 2 2 u c u w u w u w d a p z 1 2 ρ c f u c 2 2 u c u w u w u w c z d z which may be viewed as a generalized form of morison s equation with an additional term representing the frictional force due to turbulent flow absolute values are used to ensure the correct force direction due to cyclic wave motions we have thus begun with the one dimensional momentum equation and arrived at a generalized morison equation without postulating specific forms for the forces involved comments on each one of the three terms are now warranted the first component is due to local acceleration of the flow field and manifest only for unsteady or time dependent flows such as waves this force is proportional to the fluid mass decelerated by a fixed object or accelerated by a moving body the second component is due to the advective acceleration of the flow field which is conventionally called the inertia drag this force is proportional to the projection area of the object upon which the flow impinges it is essentially the same as the force caused by a water jet impinging on a plate as shown in fig 2 writing bernoulli s equation at two different points gives p p a t m 1 2 ρ u 2 for the pressure on the plate the force is simply obtained by multiplying the pressure by the circular area on which the jet hits for a moving body the corresponding resistive force arises from the motion of the body against a motionless inviscid fluid for a completely submerged symmetrical body one has to deal with d alambert s paradox of zero resistance but that may be dismissed as a problem already resolved the third component is due to the fluid viscosity which causes a skin friction drag which is proportional to the wetted surface area of the object depending on the flow characteristics laminar transient turbulent the functional dependency of this force on velocity differs at a first glance the friction drag looks similar to the inertia drag but there are essential differences between the two first of all the friction drag is proportional to the wetted surface area of the object whereas the inertia drag to the frontal projection area of the object more importantly the skin friction is not proportional to the square of the flow velocity but for this particular turbulence model to the 9 5 th power of the velocity furthermore c f is a function of the reynolds number and when evaluating the total force from eq 6 by integration this point must be properly handled an amendment for the scaling effect as done in 6 must be implemented introduction of the friction drag as a new force component is a notable aspect of the general force expression however for structures with relatively small underwater surface areas such as piles the relative importance of this new term is low compared to the others for a typical range of reynolds numbers r e 10 4 10 6 the friction coefficient c f 0 01 0 005 is quite small hence unless the wetted surface area is about one to two orders of magnitude o 10 1 10 2 larger than the frontal area this contribution is negligible therefore the absence of the skin friction term in the morison equation would not cause any perceptible error especially as this part could be absorbed into the drag force on the other hand ignoring this component in computing the resistance of ship like forms would simply be unacceptable as demonstrated in 6 by sample resistance computations thus while the absence of skin friction term in certain sea structures is not a problem its inclusion for vessels with relatively large wetted surface areas is a must finally retaining the skin friction for structures with not quite large but not small wetted surface areas may lead to more refined and accurate force estimates accomplishing this aim naturally requires a comprehensive study of re assessing the quantitative values of c m c d and c f such a task may possibly be initiated by taking α f in c f equal to a definite number such as unity and then investigating the values of c m and c d with reference to measurements for varying reynolds numbers 4 morison s equation morison o brien johnson and scaaf morison et al 1950 formulated the total wave force acting on a bottom mounted surface piercing pile of circular cross section as a sum of two contributions the virtual mass force and the drag force since its introduction in 1950 no work of surpassing quality has been reported therefore although regarded essentially heuristic it has been in wide use probably due to the hidden solid foundation behind it now that a general expression of total force based on a 1 d momentum equation has been derived the morison equation can be recovered from it and associated with firm theoretical grounds in the absence of a current u c 0 eq 7 becomes 8 d f ρ c m u w t d v z 1 2 ρ c d u w u w d a p z 1 2 ρ c f u w u w c z d z the volume and projected area elements for a circular cylinder are d v z π 4 d 2 z d z and d a p z d z d z respectively further setting the perimeter as c z π d z with d z denoting the pile diameter at an arbitrary height z turns eq 8 into 9 d f π 4 ρ c m u w t d 2 z d z 1 2 ρ c d u w u w d z d z π 2 ρ c f u w u w d z d z where c f 0 072 α f r e 5 is the friction coefficient with r e u w o d z ν defined in terms of the orbital velocity amplitude u w o and l z d z eq 9 can be manipulated further by combining the last two terms 10 d f π 4 ρ c m u w t d 2 z d z 1 2 ρ c d π c f u w u w d z d z if the friction term c f is dismissed completely or absorbed into c d as being small compared to c d eq 10 becomes morison s equation in its extended form for vertically varying diameter d z as employed in beji 2019 for oscillatory motions the virtual mass and inertia drag depend on the period or frequency of motion furthermore flow irregularities such as separation and vortex shedding appreciably affect the magnitude of these forces the present formulation in line with the morison equation has ignored such three dimensional effects completely from the beginning therefore it is only natural to lump all these effects into the coefficients keulegan carpenter number k u t d keulegan and carpenter 1958 and reynolds number reynolds 1884 are the primary parameters that c m c d and c f depend on for an explicit representation of these dependencies eq 10 is re written as 11 d f π 4 ρ c m k r e u w t d 2 z d z 1 2 ρ c d k r e u w u w d z d z where c m k r e and c d k r e emphasize the parametric dependencies on k and r e reader is directed to sarpkaya and isaacson 14 p 93 114 for an extensive exposition of the subject 5 resistance formula for ship like forms based on general expression resistance of ship like forms is now investigated in the light of eq 6 by assuming that the resistance experienced by a vessel moving at a speed u is equivalent to the external force acting on a stationary vessel in a fluid flowing with velocity u if the flow velocity is constant the acceleration is zero hence the first term of eq 6 vanishes we then have the inertia and skin friction drag as the components of total resistance the inertia drag for inclined planes and curved surfaces is examined in line with newton s classic treatment which is recapitulated below scaling of skin friction drag is elaborated in 6 wave making drag which is important for surface vessels cannot be explicitly considered in our treatment but an elementary formulation albeit insufficient is presented at the end of this section it must be emphasized that only a partial treatment of bow effect is accomplished and that the bow and stern wave interaction is not accounted for at all 5 1 newton s resistance law revisited newton proposed a quadratic resistance law 12 d i ρ c a p u 2 where d i is the inertia drag significant for fluids of small viscosity c u u is a proportionality factor denoting the ratio of the speed u of moving object to the velocity u imparted to the fluid particles coming into contact with the body ρ and a p are respectively the fluid density and the projected frontal area of the object in the direction of flow as defined before the formula essentially states that the momentum generated per unit time is equal to the resistance force acting on the body the mass of fluid particles coming into collision with the moving body per unit time is ρ a p u velocity u which is assumed to be proportional to the speed u of the object is imparted to particles the generated momentum is then ρ a p u u ρ c a p u 2 which is the resistance force experienced by the body newton extended the formulation to the case of a flow with an angle β to a perfectly smooth plane assuming that the velocity component perpendicular to the plane is annihilated the mass flow rate becomes ρ a p u sin β while the imparted velocity is u sin β consequently the force acting perpendicular to the plane is ρ a p u 2 sin 2 β 11 p 86 these arguments though speculative in nature are used in re defining the inertia drag coefficient c d for ship like forms with curved bow shapes unfortunately resistance force values based on newton s impact theory turned out to overestimate the measurements for instance if the flow is perpendicular to a plane β π 2 hence sin 2 π 2 is 1 00 but the experimental value is 0 55 similar overestimates are observed for different forms 11 p 87 despite these discrepancies the quadratic form is in accord with the inertia drag though not strictly valid for the skin friction 5 2 shape factor a simple geometrical form crudely resembling the bow section of a ship with two incident water jets is shown in fig 3 the water jet impinging on the inclined surface is assumed to reflect from it by making the same angle with the surface normal the reflected jet is resolved into two components one is running parallel to the inclined surface and other normal to it thus the velocity component normal to the inclined surface is the annihilated velocity component in newton s argument hence responsible for producing a pressure force on the surface as in the case of a water jet hitting on a plane in fig 2 with the difference that the velocity normal to the surface is now u sin β the dynamic pressure acting on the inclined plane is then 1 2 ρ u 2 sin 2 β and the total force on the inclined surface is 1 2 ρ a u 2 sin 2 β with a being the surface area but this force acts normal to the inclined plane the force acting in the direction of incoming flow is 13 f i 1 2 ρ a u 2 sin 2 β sin β 1 2 ρ a p u 2 sin 2 β where a p a sin β is the projected surface area of the inclined plane with the exception of the factor 1 2 eq 13 is in complete accord with newton s formulation for inclined planes the factor 1 2 which is an important correction for the magnitude arises from the use of bernoulli s equation instead of momentum approach eq 13 could be obtained in a slightly different way if we consider that while the normal velocity component u sin β is annihilated or reflected away from the surface the incident flow u continues flowing as u cos β over the inclined surface as shown in fig 3 bernoulli s equation written along this flow line is 14 1 2 ρ u 2 1 2 ρ u cos β 2 p s where p s is the pressure on the inclined surface and the atmospheric pressure has been dismissed as being immaterial for the present purposes solving for p s gives as before 1 2 ρ u 2 sin 2 β for the dynamic pressure on inclined surface the presence of a free surface which could not be included in our formulation is now partially considered for a flow with velocity u hitting on a curved bow like form as depicted in fig 4 the dynamic pressure on the bow like solid surface would cause an elevation of the free surface proportional to u 2 sin 2 β l with respect to a reference level z r implementing bernoulli s equation again for an annihilated velocity u sin β l gives 15 1 2 ρ u 2 sin 2 β l ρ g z r 0 ρ g z r ζ where g is the gravitational acceleration β l the local inclination angle of the solid surface and ζ the free surface elevation increase due to the local dynamic pressure solving for ζ yields 16 ζ u 2 sin 2 β l 2 g which may be included as a small correction in computing the projected area where the dynamic pressure acts on this expression of ζ is the only part of the present formulation that can come close to but definitely not sufficient of modelling the wave making drag note that the magnitude of ζ gets larger for β l values approaching the right angle and becomes maximum for β l π 2 which corresponds to a jet directly hitting a flat plate as in fig 2 on the other hand ζ gets smaller for smaller β l values and vanishes completely for β l 0 as sketched in fig 4 with blue line the mean inclination angle for any given bow shape can be formulated in terms of a fraction ξ of the ship length l and breadth b if the distance to the location where the ship breadth reaches its maximum value is ξ l as in fig 3 the mean inclination angle would exactly be β arctan b 2 ξ l regardless of the precise shape of the bow thus 17 sin 2 β 1 1 2 ξ l b 2 where the ratio ξ 1 2 in general and ξ 1 2 for a ship without parallel body if b is gained exactly at the amidships ξ may be termed as the bow shape factor of inertia resistance or shortly the shape factor nevertheless this geometrical interpretation should not be taken strictly applicable as the arguments pictured in figs 3 and 4 are obviously very speculative sin 2 β should in general be viewed as a multiplier representing the effect of streamlining of the entire body form not only the bow section 5 3 specification of shape factor the selection of ξ is quite important and a definite guidance must be provided for it first of all while this parameter stems from entirely geometric considerations of the bow shape it has the wider aspect of covering general hydrodynamic aspects hence resistance characteristics of the ship variation range of the shape parameter is found to be relatively limited ξ 0 30 0 45 for different surface ship types including a submarine specifically for a container ship and a fishing vessel ξ 0 45 for a passenger cargo ship ξ 0 35 for two other ships not reported here ξ 0 30 and finally for a submarine ξ 0 35 agree well with experimental data this narrow range of change is probably desirable to obtain a good estimate for the resistance curve of a given ship on the other hand further parametrization of ξ does not seem possible due principally this limited range of variation also again because of this narrowness in range the shape factor appears to represent those details in a ship form that cannot be formulated in terms of general parameters such as l b t c b etc in a sense ξ is an ultimate quantity representing the degree of success of a design if ξ is relatively low the ship has inefficient resistance characteristics as ξ 0 gives β π 2 flow hitting at right angle on a flat plate on the contrary if ξ is higher the ship may be said to be a relatively efficient design 6 ship resistance calculations for a constant current speed u integrating eq 6 vertically results in 18 f 1 2 ρ c d a p u 2 1 2 ρ c f s w u 2 where a p is the frontal projected area and s w the wetted surface area of the vessel based on the arguments advanced in 5 the inertia drag coefficient c d is re defined to comply with eq 13 so that c d α d sin 2 β where α d is constant of o 1 and β the mean inclination angle of the bow form as expressed in eq 17 making use of the new definition of c d in eq 18 and re arranging result in 19 f 1 2 ρ α d sin 2 β 1 b a p sin 2 β 2 g u 2 a p u 2 1 2 ρ α f 0 072 r e 5 s w u 2 in which r e u l ν an effective projected frontal area a p e a p b ζ a p 1 b ζ a p is employed by the use of 16 to account for the additional area due to mean surface rise the inertia drag and the skin friction drag are distinctly different parts of the total drag and while the former obeys the froude scaling law the latter the reynolds scaling law since it is not possible to satisfy these laws simultaneously the froude scaling is used for the model tests of resistance and the effect of unsatisfied reynolds scaling is eliminated by a roundabout approach likewise eq 19 sums the two different drag components and obviously would not give the correct results for a ship and its model when the same coefficients α d α f and ξ are used in computations this drawback may be overcome by resorting to the fundamentals according to the froude scaling u s g l s u m g l m so that if l s λ l m then u s λ 1 2 u m a p s λ 2 a p m etc assuming that eq 19 is given for a full scale mother ship and we would like to express it in terms of the model ship scaled down by λ the equation becomes 20 f s 1 2 ρ α d sin 2 β 1 λ b m λ 2 a p m sin 2 β 2 g λ u m 2 λ 2 a p m λ u m 2 1 2 ρ α f 0 072 λ 1 2 u m λ l m ν 5 λ 2 s w m λ u m 2 dividing the entire equation by λ 3 gives 21 f s λ 3 f m 1 2 ρ α d sin 2 β 1 b m a p m sin 2 β 2 g u m 2 a p m u m 2 1 2 ρ α f 0 072 λ 3 2 u m l m ν 5 s w m u m 2 the reynolds number in the skin friction term must obviously be multiplied by λ 3 2 if the force scaling is to be correct λ may be defined by virtually any dimensional quantity characterizing the ship such as λ l s l m λ b s b m etc here we shall use λ s m 1 3 since the displacement volume l b t c b embodies all the basic characteristics of a ship and therefore appears to be a better choice in order to implement this scale correction into eq 21 a definite reference value for s must be selected a convenient choice would be to set it to unit cubic meters s r e f 1 m 3 so that λ 1 m 1 3 hence λ 3 2 m 1 2 it must be emphasized that this multiplier is non dimensional because the reference value is taken dimensional in cubic meters and more importantly by definition λ is a non dimensional quantity in principle any dimensionally correct parameter with any reference magnitude can be used the choice only affects the numerical value set to the shape factor ξ the true partitioning of the inertia and friction drag is obviously lost unless r e f but the total is correct and scaled correctly instead of the prandtl kármán formula if the more common ittc approximation is used the scale corrected friction coefficient becomes c f 0 075 log r e 2 2 with being the displacement volume but regarded non dimensional ittc formula gives somewhat higher skin friction drag in comparison with the prandtl kármán formula now that the appropriate scaling has been established for the friction drag component the total resistance experienced by a ship advancing at the constant speed u can be written as 22 f 1 2 ρ a p u 2 1 b a p sin 2 β 2 g u 2 sin 2 β 0 072 r e 1 5 s w a p where the constants α d and α f both have been set to unity as the shape factor ξ alone is sufficient to tune the formula the frontal projection area is calculated as the mean cross sectional area of the ship a p l b t c b in case the wetted surface area is unavailable taylor s formula s w c l with c 2 6 is a good approximation stokoe 2003 p 27 eq 22 has been derived entirely based on the first principles the main assumption is that the flow is one dimensional and undisturbed by the presence of the object in accord with the froude krylov hypothesis a rather speculative argument in line with newton s momentum approach is also called forth to introduce a tuning parameter for the inertia drag addition of the separate contributions of the inertia and friction forces is justified on a firm theoretical foundation by taking into account the scaling appropriately with the scaling correction eq 22 can produce the resistance curves of a parent ship and its model in complete agreement with each other without changing the shape factor ξ the sole tuning parameter of the equation this point is demonstrated for a container ship and its model in 6 1 resistance curves for three different ships and a submarine are now produced by employing eq 22 together with 17 each curve is then compared with the data points obtained from corresponding experimental measurements a subsection outlining the use of eq 22 for estimating forces due to a current flowing at an angle to a ship is also included 6 1 resistance curves of a container ship model and her full scale the first test case considered is a ship model of the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso container ship model moeri kcs van et al 1998 the model was introduced solely for research aims and since then it has been used mainly for cfd validation purposes here resistance curves for the model ship and her intended full scale are computed from eq 22 for exactly the same shape factor ξ and compared with experimental data table 1 gives the main characteristics of the moeri kcs container ship model and the corresponding full scale ship seawater density and viscosity are taken ρ 1026 kg m 3 and ν 1 189 10 6 m 2 s respectively the corresponding values for fresh water are ρ 998 2 kg m 3 and ν 1 003 10 6 m 2 s by trial and error the shape factor is set to ξ 0 45 so that sin 2 β 1 1 2 ξ l b 2 0 0236 both for the model and full scale ship since l b 7 2786 1 019 230 0 32 2 7 14 is the same the mean projected area is obtained from a p l for each case unless indicated otherwise the length between perpendiculars l p p is used for all the calculations presented in this and other subsections fig 5 shows the experimental data and the resistance curve computed from eq 22 for a range of froude numbers f r u g l using the same shape factor the resistance curve of the full scale ship is also computed and drawn in fig 6 with scaled up experimental data except for minor differences due to the use of different fresh vs salt water viscosity values the computed resistance curves are identical this proves that the different scales are handled perfectly by eq 22 which is made up of two distinct drag components with different scaling laws provided that the single tuning parameter ξ is selected properly the present resistance formula performs well disagreement in the high speed region f r 0 25 is likely to be a manifestation of additional wave resistance which could not be included in eq 22 from the mathematical point of view eq 22 is essentially a second order polynomial in u but the experimental curve for higher speeds obviously diverges from the quadratic form 6 2 resistance curve of a fishing vessel obreja et al 2010 investigated the manoeuvring characteristics of a fishing vessel città di genova and besides hydrodynamic derivatives presented experimental results of resistance tests the full scale main characteristics of this vessel are given in table 2 the wetted surface area is estimated by the use of taylor s formula s w 2 6 l and the mean projected area is calculated from a p l as indicated before the shape factor is again set to ξ 0 45 as in 6 1 despite the very different ship types the container ship and fishing vessel the reasonable performance of eq 22 with the same ξ 0 45 shown in fig 7 may be attributed to two main reasons first eq 22 contains all the essential elements of expressing ship resistance in terms of overall characteristics of a ship second ξ is not related to the type of ship considered but possibly dependent on the ship form details that cannot be parametrized easily these points render the determination of ξ for a given ship an open question a plausible approach is to generate two curves corresponding to say ξ 0 25 and ξ 0 50 to describe a wide region between higher and lower resistance curves that would include the true resistance curve of the vessel finally we must point out that despite the overall acceptable agreement for ξ 0 45 different character of the experimental resistance curve does not allow a good fit in any part indeed a best fit to the experimental data in the form r t a u α yields a 0 025 and α 3 07 revealing that the experimental resistance curve is cubic in u this remarkable point is not peculiar to this particular case alone and should be investigated on its own probably in connection with wave making drag 6 3 resistance curve of a passenger cargo coaster hetharia de fretes and gaspersz hetharia et al 2019 studied resistance characteristics of three different ships by computing the resistance curves from statistical formulas and by testing the ship models in towing tank a passenger cargo coaster whose particulars are given in table 3 is considered here since the length between perpendiculars was not provided an estimated value l p p 35 00 m is used the shape factor is set to ξ 0 35 lower than the value used in the previous two cases fig 8 shows the resistance curves of the coaster according to the experimental data and eq 22 agreement between the two curves is quite acceptable especially if allowances are made for the simple form of eq 22 with just single tuning parameter ξ 6 4 resistance curve of a submarine darpa suboff submarine model developed under the submarine technology program office of the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa is a well known prototype used for research purposes table 4 gives the main characteristics of the darpa suboff bare hull submarine model experimental measurements of han lieh and thomas 1998 are now used for testing the performance of a slightly reduced form of eq 22 in the absence of a free surface the additional increase of the frontal projected area b ζ is dismissed hence for an underwater vessel eq 22 is reduced to the following form 23 f 1 2 ρ a p u 2 sin 2 β 0 072 r e 1 5 s w a p where sin 2 β 1 1 2 ξ l b 2 as defined before for constructing the resistance curve of darpa suboff model eq 23 is used with ξ 0 35 the fresh water density and viscosity values are used and the projected area is calculated from a p l by setting l l o a for the submarine length fig 9 shows the resistance curves of darpa suboff submarine model according to the experimental data and eq 23 for ξ 0 35 the prediction agrees virtually perfectly with the measurements this must be basically due to the second order character of the experimental data we may also conclude that the absence of additional wave making resistance makes the agreement remarkably well otherwise above a definite threshold speed the presence of free surface changes the character of resistance curve to the third order 6 5 forces due to a current at an angle to a ship especially for ship manoeuvring simulations the estimation of wave and current forces at an angle to the ship is of primary importance eq 22 developed for the purpose of estimating ship resistance may well be adopted for such use here we shall outline the basic approach for such a possibility a detailed investigation exceeds the limits of this already lengthy treatment let it be remarked that for wave forces the unsteady mass or inertia force in 7 should be added to 22 while the friction drag can be neglected the current angle of attack relative to the bow is expressed as γ c ψ β c π where ψ is the heading angle of the ship and β c the current direction angle measured due north fossen 2011 p 153 accordingly the current velocity components in the x and y directions of a coordinate system fixed to the ship are u c v c cos γ c and v c v c sin γ c where v c is the current speed if the vessel is in motion the relative current speeds u r u u c and v r v v c must be used fossen 2011 p 125 27 then in terms of relative current speeds the external force components can be formulated from eq 22 as follows 24 f x 1 2 ρ a p x u r u r 1 b a p x sin 2 β x 2 g u r 2 sin 2 β x 0 072 r e x 1 5 s w a p x 25 f y 1 2 ρ a p y v r v r 1 l a p y sin 2 β y 2 g v r 2 sin 2 β y 0 072 r e y 1 5 s w a p y in the above formulas a p x l b t c b and a p y b l t c b are the mean cross sectional areas in the lengthwise and lateral directions of the ship the reynolds numbers for the x and y directions are r e x u r l ν and r e x v r b ν respectively sin 2 β x 1 1 2 ξ x l b 2 and sin 2 β y 1 1 2 ξ y b l 2 are the inertia force coefficients principally determined by the shape factors ξ x and ξ y for the x and y directions ξ x may be taken as determined according to the resistance characteristics of the ship which is shown to vary approximately in the range 0 30 0 45 ξ y on the other hand must be determined by comparisons with experimental measurements of definite ships or relevant statistical formulas u r u r and v r v r are used instead of u r 2 and v r 2 to account for correct force directions also the turning moment acting on the ship due to current can be formulated with the aid of f y as m c x g f y f y with x g f y denoting the distance between the horizontal centre of gravity of ship and the acting point of lateral force f y in this approach an empirical expression for x g f y as a percentage of ship length is necessary the munk moment in presence of current should also be accounted for properly finally it is worthwhile to note that eq 24 becomes identical with 22 when u r is equated to the ship speed u 7 concluding remarks an elementary treatment of wave and current forces and ship resistance has been done based on the first principles a general theoretical formulation of wave and current forces acting on an object has been accomplished by the use of 1 d momentum equation the resulting general expression renders morison s equation as a special case thus placing this equation on a solid theoretical ground furthermore the precise meaning of the drag force is clarified by observing it to be actually nothing more than the inertia drag or dynamic pressure drag the inertia drag coefficient of general expression is then modified for ship resistance calculations by following newton s arguments the effect of froude and reynolds scaling difference is removed by changing the reynolds number in a way that the resistance calculations for a ship and her model are consistent for the same tuning factor the resistance formula is tested for three different types of surface ships and a submarine against the experimental data with quite agreeable results this work however makes no pretence of proposing a precise formula for resistance calculations but rather of disclosing the essential physical mechanisms that lead to sound quantitative estimates further refinements in the formulations may be possible in the future by implementing the hints and suggestions made here especially concerning the wave making resistance bow stern wave interaction and more importantly change in resistance curve character of surface ships above a threshold speed the last issue apparently not brought up in the relevant literature yet seems to be the most challenging problem credit authorship contribution statement s beji

21351,a general expression is formulated from the first principles for wave and current forces acting on a body morison s equation is recovered as a special case of the general formulation thus establishing this heuristic regarded equation on a firm theoretical ground the drag force is clearly seen to be originating from the advective acceleration and the skin friction resistance which is not explicitly represented in morison s equation is viewed as a small part of the drag force for the special case of constant flow velocity the general expression is employed to derive a resistance formula for ships the viscous term is handled through the use of prandtl kármán formulation of friction drag due to a turbulent boundary layer conflict between froude and reynolds scaling is reconciled by allowing a deviation from the true partition of the corresponding forces but ensuring in return the correct scaling of the total resistance force for the model and ship the performance of the resistance formula is checked against the experimental measurements of various ship forms finally formulas for forces due to a current at an angle to a ship are suggested keywords wave and current forces inertia drag and frictional forces morison s equation ship resistance 1 introduction estimation of forces acting on an object moving in fluid or fixed in space but subjected to a flow field has always been of a major interest to engineers froude froude and froude 1888 made the first comprehensive and practical treatment of ship resistance and set the tone for further research on this subject as to the wave forces acting on a fixed object the work of morison o brien johnson and scaaf morison et al 1950 in 1950 which resulted in the formulation known briefly as the morison equation may be referred to as pioneering and most widely used one despite its popularity this formulation has been regarded as a heuristic expression combining the inertia and drag forces indeed the paper opens by simply stating the formulation without embarking on any justifying argument the total force exerted by surface waves is simply pronounced as composed of a virtual mass force and a drag force this distinct separation and subsequent addition of these different contributions have often been questioned sarpkaya and isaacson 1981 spm 1984 here it is not only observed clearly that these two forces essentially stem from the same source but also their addition is naturally dictated by the momentum equation itself furthermore a third contribution arising from the frictional effects is identified and expressed in terms of mean flow velocity as formulated by prandtl and kármán independently prandtl and tietjens 1957 p 75 based on blasius s law of pressure drop for turbulent flows blasius 1911 this frictional term however is assessed to be negligible or at most accountable as a part of drag force for marine structures with wetted surface areas not appreciably greater than frontal projection areas a ship resistance formula is developed by dismissing the incident wave field completely and taking only a constant current in the general expression describing combined wave and current forces for ship like vessels the wetted surface area is considerably greater than the frontal projection area hence the skin friction drag cannot be neglected therefore the inertia drag term whose coefficient is manipulated through newtonian arguments and the skin friction term are kept together in establishing a formula for the resistance of ships the well known problem of the froude versus reynolds scaling is resolved in a fundamental way by sacrificing the true partition of these forces but gaining the correct scaling of the total resistance force several surface ships and a submarine are considered for testing the predictive capabilities of the resistance formula formulas for estimating the inline and lateral forces acting on a ship in presence of a current at an angle are also suggested in closing 2 derivation of a general force expression from 1 d momentum equation an object partially immersed in fluid and piercing above the free surface is considered as shown in fig 1 for the sake of generality the breadth b z and length l z of the object are varying functions of the vertical coordinate z likewise the bottom of the object is not necessarily sitting on the bed an incident flow velocity u x z t which may be unsteady and vertically varying impinges on the body in the x direction only the momentum equation for 1 d flow is 1 ρ u t ρ u u x p x τ y x y where ρ is the fluid density u the velocity in the x direction p the pressure and τ y x the shearing stress acting in the x direction normal to the y direction as the flow is taken one dimensional the velocity components v and w are tacitly set to zero by assuming their contribution negligible in accord with froude krylov hypothesis as evoked in morison et al 1950 multiply 1 by the volume element d v d x d y d z and integrate over the object in the x and y directions to get 2 b z 2 b z 2 l z 2 l z 2 p x d x d y d z b z 2 b z 2 l z 2 l z 2 ρ u t d x d y d z b z 2 b z 2 l z 2 l z 2 ρ 2 u 2 x d x d y d z l z 2 l z 2 b z 2 τ y x y d y d x d z l z 2 l z 2 b z 2 τ y x y d y d x d z where the last two integrals over the left and right semi surfaces of the object indicate the frictional drag due to shearing stresses acting on the entire surface area of the object they are identical for an object with x z plane symmetry carrying out the integrals results in 3 p b p f b z d z ρ u r t b z l z d z ρ 2 u b 2 u f 2 b z d z l z 2 l z 2 τ y x τ y x b z 2 d x d z l z 2 l z 2 τ y x τ y x b z 2 d x d z where the subscripts b and f stand respectively for the back and front of the object as aligned in the x direction when the flow is in the positive x direction the front side pressure p f is greater than the back side pressure p b hence p f p b is positive for a reversed flow direction it is obviously negative area element on the front face of the pile b z d z is the projected area element d a p z b z d z of the object facing incident flow then p f p b d a p z indicates the net differential force acting on an infinitesimal height d z of the pile namely d f f f f b d z which may be positive or negative depending on the flow direction fluid acceleration u r t in the vicinity of the object is calculated by using a representative flow velocity u r which for practical purposes is related to the incident flow velocity by u r c m u since the accelerative force is associated with the added or virtual mass of moving body the constant c m may be viewed as an added mass coefficient the symbol c m is especially taken to correspond to the mass or inertia coefficient used in morison et al 1950 b z l z d z is no other than the infinitesimal volume element b z l z d z d v so that the mass force ρ c m u t d v is proportional to the submerged mass ρ v of the body the second term on the right of eq 3 is the so called drag force component of the morison equation it is probably more appropriate to name this term inertia drag or dynamic pressure drag as termed in prandtl and tietjens prandtl and tietjens 1957 p 86 95 in order to express this component in terms of the incident velocity the difference u b 2 u f 2 should be related to u 2 by a proportionality factor say c d again as used in morison et al 1950 writing then u b 2 u f 2 c d u 2 gives 1 2 ρ c d u 2 d a p z for the pressure drag per infinitesimal height d z this term is advective acceleration and it would be wrong to consider the virtual mass force ρ c m u t d v as ρ c m u t u u x d v to account for total acceleration of the flow field as argued in the relevant literature it is equally wrong to state that the linearised acceleration is used for the flow by taking u t alone this misconception arises because the origin of the drag force as given by morison et al 1950 could not be traced to the field acceleration u u x before with the aid of the present derivation it should be clear that re introducing u u x besides u t in the mass force is erroneous such an attempt as investigated in 14 p 457 reveals a baffling result because the correct way of treating u u x is to treat it as pressure drag proportional to the frontal projected area of the object using the total acceleration ρ u t u u x for computing inertia force and then adding this to the drag force which is shown to be arising from ρ u u x is obviously an inconsistent repetition the last two integrals in eq 3 represent the frictional force acting on the outer surface of the object the shearing stresses far away from the surface τ y x and τ y x vanish as the flow field becomes uniform to proceed with the integrals the shearing stresses on either side of the underwater body surface τ y x b z 2 and τ y x b z 2 must be specified based on the pressure drop formula of blasius 1911 from experiments with turbulent flows prandtl and kármán independent of each other derived the following expression for the shearing stress on a flat plate 4 τ 0 0 0288 ρ u 2 ν u 1 5 1 x 5 where subscript 0 denotes the surface value u is the undisturbed flow velocity x the distance in the lengthwise or flow direction along the plate and ν μ ρ the kinematic viscosity using τ 0 both for τ y x b z 2 and τ y x b z 2 integrating along the length of the object l z gives 5 2 l z 2 l z 2 τ 0 d x d z 0 072 r e 5 1 2 ρ u 2 c z d z where r e u l z ν is the reynolds number reynolds 1884 computed using the length l z in the flow direction x and c z 2 b z l z the perimeter of the object at a height z it results from the integration of both sides of the object in the x direction by taking into account the protrusion in the y direction thus circumscribing the cross section at height z integral c z d z s w gives the wetted surface area or the underwater surface area of the object note that the frictional force for turbulent flow is not proportional to u 2 but u 9 5 u 1 8 when the 1 5 th power of velocity in denominator is taken out letting l z l eq 5 can be rearranged as 0 036 ρ l ν 5 s w u 1 8 which is strikingly similar to r e froude s frictional resistance formula r f f s w u 1 825 with f being a coefficient which depends on the waterline length of the ship rawson and tupper 2001 p 699 also these two formulas yield quite comparable quantitative results it is possible to use a different shear stress formulation for turbulent flow such as ittc attc hughes or granville as listed in lewis lewis 1988 p 12 nevertheless the present work adheres to the prandtl kármán formula as it has a solid theoretical and experimental background now that each contribution in eq 2 has been expressed in terms of the incident velocity u a general expression for the horizontal force d f in the x direction per infinitesimal height d z can be written as 6 d f ρ c m u t d v z 1 2 ρ c d u 2 d a p z 1 2 ρ c f u 2 c z d z where c f 0 072 α f r e 5 is the friction coefficient with an additional constant α f which like c m and c d is introduced to compensate variations in the flow velocity and o 1 for flat plates α f can simply be set to unity a quite important detail concerning the appropriate use of the above formula must be mentioned the inertia terms the first two terms scale according to the froude number while the remaining friction term scales according to the reynolds number if eq 6 is to give consistent results for a model and its full scale a correction factor must be introduced to the reynolds number in the friction term in 6 this problem is resolved by a formal analysis and then demonstrated for a container ship in 6 1 3 waves and currents combined by assuming that the linear superposition principle holds the flow field u may be specified as composed of two different contributions a steady current u c z which depends only on the vertical coordinate z such as a logarithmic profile and an unsteady incident wave field u w x z t thus letting u u c z u w x z t in 6 gives 7 d f ρ c m u w t d v z 1 2 ρ c d u c 2 2 u c u w u w u w d a p z 1 2 ρ c f u c 2 2 u c u w u w u w c z d z which may be viewed as a generalized form of morison s equation with an additional term representing the frictional force due to turbulent flow absolute values are used to ensure the correct force direction due to cyclic wave motions we have thus begun with the one dimensional momentum equation and arrived at a generalized morison equation without postulating specific forms for the forces involved comments on each one of the three terms are now warranted the first component is due to local acceleration of the flow field and manifest only for unsteady or time dependent flows such as waves this force is proportional to the fluid mass decelerated by a fixed object or accelerated by a moving body the second component is due to the advective acceleration of the flow field which is conventionally called the inertia drag this force is proportional to the projection area of the object upon which the flow impinges it is essentially the same as the force caused by a water jet impinging on a plate as shown in fig 2 writing bernoulli s equation at two different points gives p p a t m 1 2 ρ u 2 for the pressure on the plate the force is simply obtained by multiplying the pressure by the circular area on which the jet hits for a moving body the corresponding resistive force arises from the motion of the body against a motionless inviscid fluid for a completely submerged symmetrical body one has to deal with d alambert s paradox of zero resistance but that may be dismissed as a problem already resolved the third component is due to the fluid viscosity which causes a skin friction drag which is proportional to the wetted surface area of the object depending on the flow characteristics laminar transient turbulent the functional dependency of this force on velocity differs at a first glance the friction drag looks similar to the inertia drag but there are essential differences between the two first of all the friction drag is proportional to the wetted surface area of the object whereas the inertia drag to the frontal projection area of the object more importantly the skin friction is not proportional to the square of the flow velocity but for this particular turbulence model to the 9 5 th power of the velocity furthermore c f is a function of the reynolds number and when evaluating the total force from eq 6 by integration this point must be properly handled an amendment for the scaling effect as done in 6 must be implemented introduction of the friction drag as a new force component is a notable aspect of the general force expression however for structures with relatively small underwater surface areas such as piles the relative importance of this new term is low compared to the others for a typical range of reynolds numbers r e 10 4 10 6 the friction coefficient c f 0 01 0 005 is quite small hence unless the wetted surface area is about one to two orders of magnitude o 10 1 10 2 larger than the frontal area this contribution is negligible therefore the absence of the skin friction term in the morison equation would not cause any perceptible error especially as this part could be absorbed into the drag force on the other hand ignoring this component in computing the resistance of ship like forms would simply be unacceptable as demonstrated in 6 by sample resistance computations thus while the absence of skin friction term in certain sea structures is not a problem its inclusion for vessels with relatively large wetted surface areas is a must finally retaining the skin friction for structures with not quite large but not small wetted surface areas may lead to more refined and accurate force estimates accomplishing this aim naturally requires a comprehensive study of re assessing the quantitative values of c m c d and c f such a task may possibly be initiated by taking α f in c f equal to a definite number such as unity and then investigating the values of c m and c d with reference to measurements for varying reynolds numbers 4 morison s equation morison o brien johnson and scaaf morison et al 1950 formulated the total wave force acting on a bottom mounted surface piercing pile of circular cross section as a sum of two contributions the virtual mass force and the drag force since its introduction in 1950 no work of surpassing quality has been reported therefore although regarded essentially heuristic it has been in wide use probably due to the hidden solid foundation behind it now that a general expression of total force based on a 1 d momentum equation has been derived the morison equation can be recovered from it and associated with firm theoretical grounds in the absence of a current u c 0 eq 7 becomes 8 d f ρ c m u w t d v z 1 2 ρ c d u w u w d a p z 1 2 ρ c f u w u w c z d z the volume and projected area elements for a circular cylinder are d v z π 4 d 2 z d z and d a p z d z d z respectively further setting the perimeter as c z π d z with d z denoting the pile diameter at an arbitrary height z turns eq 8 into 9 d f π 4 ρ c m u w t d 2 z d z 1 2 ρ c d u w u w d z d z π 2 ρ c f u w u w d z d z where c f 0 072 α f r e 5 is the friction coefficient with r e u w o d z ν defined in terms of the orbital velocity amplitude u w o and l z d z eq 9 can be manipulated further by combining the last two terms 10 d f π 4 ρ c m u w t d 2 z d z 1 2 ρ c d π c f u w u w d z d z if the friction term c f is dismissed completely or absorbed into c d as being small compared to c d eq 10 becomes morison s equation in its extended form for vertically varying diameter d z as employed in beji 2019 for oscillatory motions the virtual mass and inertia drag depend on the period or frequency of motion furthermore flow irregularities such as separation and vortex shedding appreciably affect the magnitude of these forces the present formulation in line with the morison equation has ignored such three dimensional effects completely from the beginning therefore it is only natural to lump all these effects into the coefficients keulegan carpenter number k u t d keulegan and carpenter 1958 and reynolds number reynolds 1884 are the primary parameters that c m c d and c f depend on for an explicit representation of these dependencies eq 10 is re written as 11 d f π 4 ρ c m k r e u w t d 2 z d z 1 2 ρ c d k r e u w u w d z d z where c m k r e and c d k r e emphasize the parametric dependencies on k and r e reader is directed to sarpkaya and isaacson 14 p 93 114 for an extensive exposition of the subject 5 resistance formula for ship like forms based on general expression resistance of ship like forms is now investigated in the light of eq 6 by assuming that the resistance experienced by a vessel moving at a speed u is equivalent to the external force acting on a stationary vessel in a fluid flowing with velocity u if the flow velocity is constant the acceleration is zero hence the first term of eq 6 vanishes we then have the inertia and skin friction drag as the components of total resistance the inertia drag for inclined planes and curved surfaces is examined in line with newton s classic treatment which is recapitulated below scaling of skin friction drag is elaborated in 6 wave making drag which is important for surface vessels cannot be explicitly considered in our treatment but an elementary formulation albeit insufficient is presented at the end of this section it must be emphasized that only a partial treatment of bow effect is accomplished and that the bow and stern wave interaction is not accounted for at all 5 1 newton s resistance law revisited newton proposed a quadratic resistance law 12 d i ρ c a p u 2 where d i is the inertia drag significant for fluids of small viscosity c u u is a proportionality factor denoting the ratio of the speed u of moving object to the velocity u imparted to the fluid particles coming into contact with the body ρ and a p are respectively the fluid density and the projected frontal area of the object in the direction of flow as defined before the formula essentially states that the momentum generated per unit time is equal to the resistance force acting on the body the mass of fluid particles coming into collision with the moving body per unit time is ρ a p u velocity u which is assumed to be proportional to the speed u of the object is imparted to particles the generated momentum is then ρ a p u u ρ c a p u 2 which is the resistance force experienced by the body newton extended the formulation to the case of a flow with an angle β to a perfectly smooth plane assuming that the velocity component perpendicular to the plane is annihilated the mass flow rate becomes ρ a p u sin β while the imparted velocity is u sin β consequently the force acting perpendicular to the plane is ρ a p u 2 sin 2 β 11 p 86 these arguments though speculative in nature are used in re defining the inertia drag coefficient c d for ship like forms with curved bow shapes unfortunately resistance force values based on newton s impact theory turned out to overestimate the measurements for instance if the flow is perpendicular to a plane β π 2 hence sin 2 π 2 is 1 00 but the experimental value is 0 55 similar overestimates are observed for different forms 11 p 87 despite these discrepancies the quadratic form is in accord with the inertia drag though not strictly valid for the skin friction 5 2 shape factor a simple geometrical form crudely resembling the bow section of a ship with two incident water jets is shown in fig 3 the water jet impinging on the inclined surface is assumed to reflect from it by making the same angle with the surface normal the reflected jet is resolved into two components one is running parallel to the inclined surface and other normal to it thus the velocity component normal to the inclined surface is the annihilated velocity component in newton s argument hence responsible for producing a pressure force on the surface as in the case of a water jet hitting on a plane in fig 2 with the difference that the velocity normal to the surface is now u sin β the dynamic pressure acting on the inclined plane is then 1 2 ρ u 2 sin 2 β and the total force on the inclined surface is 1 2 ρ a u 2 sin 2 β with a being the surface area but this force acts normal to the inclined plane the force acting in the direction of incoming flow is 13 f i 1 2 ρ a u 2 sin 2 β sin β 1 2 ρ a p u 2 sin 2 β where a p a sin β is the projected surface area of the inclined plane with the exception of the factor 1 2 eq 13 is in complete accord with newton s formulation for inclined planes the factor 1 2 which is an important correction for the magnitude arises from the use of bernoulli s equation instead of momentum approach eq 13 could be obtained in a slightly different way if we consider that while the normal velocity component u sin β is annihilated or reflected away from the surface the incident flow u continues flowing as u cos β over the inclined surface as shown in fig 3 bernoulli s equation written along this flow line is 14 1 2 ρ u 2 1 2 ρ u cos β 2 p s where p s is the pressure on the inclined surface and the atmospheric pressure has been dismissed as being immaterial for the present purposes solving for p s gives as before 1 2 ρ u 2 sin 2 β for the dynamic pressure on inclined surface the presence of a free surface which could not be included in our formulation is now partially considered for a flow with velocity u hitting on a curved bow like form as depicted in fig 4 the dynamic pressure on the bow like solid surface would cause an elevation of the free surface proportional to u 2 sin 2 β l with respect to a reference level z r implementing bernoulli s equation again for an annihilated velocity u sin β l gives 15 1 2 ρ u 2 sin 2 β l ρ g z r 0 ρ g z r ζ where g is the gravitational acceleration β l the local inclination angle of the solid surface and ζ the free surface elevation increase due to the local dynamic pressure solving for ζ yields 16 ζ u 2 sin 2 β l 2 g which may be included as a small correction in computing the projected area where the dynamic pressure acts on this expression of ζ is the only part of the present formulation that can come close to but definitely not sufficient of modelling the wave making drag note that the magnitude of ζ gets larger for β l values approaching the right angle and becomes maximum for β l π 2 which corresponds to a jet directly hitting a flat plate as in fig 2 on the other hand ζ gets smaller for smaller β l values and vanishes completely for β l 0 as sketched in fig 4 with blue line the mean inclination angle for any given bow shape can be formulated in terms of a fraction ξ of the ship length l and breadth b if the distance to the location where the ship breadth reaches its maximum value is ξ l as in fig 3 the mean inclination angle would exactly be β arctan b 2 ξ l regardless of the precise shape of the bow thus 17 sin 2 β 1 1 2 ξ l b 2 where the ratio ξ 1 2 in general and ξ 1 2 for a ship without parallel body if b is gained exactly at the amidships ξ may be termed as the bow shape factor of inertia resistance or shortly the shape factor nevertheless this geometrical interpretation should not be taken strictly applicable as the arguments pictured in figs 3 and 4 are obviously very speculative sin 2 β should in general be viewed as a multiplier representing the effect of streamlining of the entire body form not only the bow section 5 3 specification of shape factor the selection of ξ is quite important and a definite guidance must be provided for it first of all while this parameter stems from entirely geometric considerations of the bow shape it has the wider aspect of covering general hydrodynamic aspects hence resistance characteristics of the ship variation range of the shape parameter is found to be relatively limited ξ 0 30 0 45 for different surface ship types including a submarine specifically for a container ship and a fishing vessel ξ 0 45 for a passenger cargo ship ξ 0 35 for two other ships not reported here ξ 0 30 and finally for a submarine ξ 0 35 agree well with experimental data this narrow range of change is probably desirable to obtain a good estimate for the resistance curve of a given ship on the other hand further parametrization of ξ does not seem possible due principally this limited range of variation also again because of this narrowness in range the shape factor appears to represent those details in a ship form that cannot be formulated in terms of general parameters such as l b t c b etc in a sense ξ is an ultimate quantity representing the degree of success of a design if ξ is relatively low the ship has inefficient resistance characteristics as ξ 0 gives β π 2 flow hitting at right angle on a flat plate on the contrary if ξ is higher the ship may be said to be a relatively efficient design 6 ship resistance calculations for a constant current speed u integrating eq 6 vertically results in 18 f 1 2 ρ c d a p u 2 1 2 ρ c f s w u 2 where a p is the frontal projected area and s w the wetted surface area of the vessel based on the arguments advanced in 5 the inertia drag coefficient c d is re defined to comply with eq 13 so that c d α d sin 2 β where α d is constant of o 1 and β the mean inclination angle of the bow form as expressed in eq 17 making use of the new definition of c d in eq 18 and re arranging result in 19 f 1 2 ρ α d sin 2 β 1 b a p sin 2 β 2 g u 2 a p u 2 1 2 ρ α f 0 072 r e 5 s w u 2 in which r e u l ν an effective projected frontal area a p e a p b ζ a p 1 b ζ a p is employed by the use of 16 to account for the additional area due to mean surface rise the inertia drag and the skin friction drag are distinctly different parts of the total drag and while the former obeys the froude scaling law the latter the reynolds scaling law since it is not possible to satisfy these laws simultaneously the froude scaling is used for the model tests of resistance and the effect of unsatisfied reynolds scaling is eliminated by a roundabout approach likewise eq 19 sums the two different drag components and obviously would not give the correct results for a ship and its model when the same coefficients α d α f and ξ are used in computations this drawback may be overcome by resorting to the fundamentals according to the froude scaling u s g l s u m g l m so that if l s λ l m then u s λ 1 2 u m a p s λ 2 a p m etc assuming that eq 19 is given for a full scale mother ship and we would like to express it in terms of the model ship scaled down by λ the equation becomes 20 f s 1 2 ρ α d sin 2 β 1 λ b m λ 2 a p m sin 2 β 2 g λ u m 2 λ 2 a p m λ u m 2 1 2 ρ α f 0 072 λ 1 2 u m λ l m ν 5 λ 2 s w m λ u m 2 dividing the entire equation by λ 3 gives 21 f s λ 3 f m 1 2 ρ α d sin 2 β 1 b m a p m sin 2 β 2 g u m 2 a p m u m 2 1 2 ρ α f 0 072 λ 3 2 u m l m ν 5 s w m u m 2 the reynolds number in the skin friction term must obviously be multiplied by λ 3 2 if the force scaling is to be correct λ may be defined by virtually any dimensional quantity characterizing the ship such as λ l s l m λ b s b m etc here we shall use λ s m 1 3 since the displacement volume l b t c b embodies all the basic characteristics of a ship and therefore appears to be a better choice in order to implement this scale correction into eq 21 a definite reference value for s must be selected a convenient choice would be to set it to unit cubic meters s r e f 1 m 3 so that λ 1 m 1 3 hence λ 3 2 m 1 2 it must be emphasized that this multiplier is non dimensional because the reference value is taken dimensional in cubic meters and more importantly by definition λ is a non dimensional quantity in principle any dimensionally correct parameter with any reference magnitude can be used the choice only affects the numerical value set to the shape factor ξ the true partitioning of the inertia and friction drag is obviously lost unless r e f but the total is correct and scaled correctly instead of the prandtl kármán formula if the more common ittc approximation is used the scale corrected friction coefficient becomes c f 0 075 log r e 2 2 with being the displacement volume but regarded non dimensional ittc formula gives somewhat higher skin friction drag in comparison with the prandtl kármán formula now that the appropriate scaling has been established for the friction drag component the total resistance experienced by a ship advancing at the constant speed u can be written as 22 f 1 2 ρ a p u 2 1 b a p sin 2 β 2 g u 2 sin 2 β 0 072 r e 1 5 s w a p where the constants α d and α f both have been set to unity as the shape factor ξ alone is sufficient to tune the formula the frontal projection area is calculated as the mean cross sectional area of the ship a p l b t c b in case the wetted surface area is unavailable taylor s formula s w c l with c 2 6 is a good approximation stokoe 2003 p 27 eq 22 has been derived entirely based on the first principles the main assumption is that the flow is one dimensional and undisturbed by the presence of the object in accord with the froude krylov hypothesis a rather speculative argument in line with newton s momentum approach is also called forth to introduce a tuning parameter for the inertia drag addition of the separate contributions of the inertia and friction forces is justified on a firm theoretical foundation by taking into account the scaling appropriately with the scaling correction eq 22 can produce the resistance curves of a parent ship and its model in complete agreement with each other without changing the shape factor ξ the sole tuning parameter of the equation this point is demonstrated for a container ship and its model in 6 1 resistance curves for three different ships and a submarine are now produced by employing eq 22 together with 17 each curve is then compared with the data points obtained from corresponding experimental measurements a subsection outlining the use of eq 22 for estimating forces due to a current flowing at an angle to a ship is also included 6 1 resistance curves of a container ship model and her full scale the first test case considered is a ship model of the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso container ship model moeri kcs van et al 1998 the model was introduced solely for research aims and since then it has been used mainly for cfd validation purposes here resistance curves for the model ship and her intended full scale are computed from eq 22 for exactly the same shape factor ξ and compared with experimental data table 1 gives the main characteristics of the moeri kcs container ship model and the corresponding full scale ship seawater density and viscosity are taken ρ 1026 kg m 3 and ν 1 189 10 6 m 2 s respectively the corresponding values for fresh water are ρ 998 2 kg m 3 and ν 1 003 10 6 m 2 s by trial and error the shape factor is set to ξ 0 45 so that sin 2 β 1 1 2 ξ l b 2 0 0236 both for the model and full scale ship since l b 7 2786 1 019 230 0 32 2 7 14 is the same the mean projected area is obtained from a p l for each case unless indicated otherwise the length between perpendiculars l p p is used for all the calculations presented in this and other subsections fig 5 shows the experimental data and the resistance curve computed from eq 22 for a range of froude numbers f r u g l using the same shape factor the resistance curve of the full scale ship is also computed and drawn in fig 6 with scaled up experimental data except for minor differences due to the use of different fresh vs salt water viscosity values the computed resistance curves are identical this proves that the different scales are handled perfectly by eq 22 which is made up of two distinct drag components with different scaling laws provided that the single tuning parameter ξ is selected properly the present resistance formula performs well disagreement in the high speed region f r 0 25 is likely to be a manifestation of additional wave resistance which could not be included in eq 22 from the mathematical point of view eq 22 is essentially a second order polynomial in u but the experimental curve for higher speeds obviously diverges from the quadratic form 6 2 resistance curve of a fishing vessel obreja et al 2010 investigated the manoeuvring characteristics of a fishing vessel città di genova and besides hydrodynamic derivatives presented experimental results of resistance tests the full scale main characteristics of this vessel are given in table 2 the wetted surface area is estimated by the use of taylor s formula s w 2 6 l and the mean projected area is calculated from a p l as indicated before the shape factor is again set to ξ 0 45 as in 6 1 despite the very different ship types the container ship and fishing vessel the reasonable performance of eq 22 with the same ξ 0 45 shown in fig 7 may be attributed to two main reasons first eq 22 contains all the essential elements of expressing ship resistance in terms of overall characteristics of a ship second ξ is not related to the type of ship considered but possibly dependent on the ship form details that cannot be parametrized easily these points render the determination of ξ for a given ship an open question a plausible approach is to generate two curves corresponding to say ξ 0 25 and ξ 0 50 to describe a wide region between higher and lower resistance curves that would include the true resistance curve of the vessel finally we must point out that despite the overall acceptable agreement for ξ 0 45 different character of the experimental resistance curve does not allow a good fit in any part indeed a best fit to the experimental data in the form r t a u α yields a 0 025 and α 3 07 revealing that the experimental resistance curve is cubic in u this remarkable point is not peculiar to this particular case alone and should be investigated on its own probably in connection with wave making drag 6 3 resistance curve of a passenger cargo coaster hetharia de fretes and gaspersz hetharia et al 2019 studied resistance characteristics of three different ships by computing the resistance curves from statistical formulas and by testing the ship models in towing tank a passenger cargo coaster whose particulars are given in table 3 is considered here since the length between perpendiculars was not provided an estimated value l p p 35 00 m is used the shape factor is set to ξ 0 35 lower than the value used in the previous two cases fig 8 shows the resistance curves of the coaster according to the experimental data and eq 22 agreement between the two curves is quite acceptable especially if allowances are made for the simple form of eq 22 with just single tuning parameter ξ 6 4 resistance curve of a submarine darpa suboff submarine model developed under the submarine technology program office of the us defense advanced research projects agency darpa is a well known prototype used for research purposes table 4 gives the main characteristics of the darpa suboff bare hull submarine model experimental measurements of han lieh and thomas 1998 are now used for testing the performance of a slightly reduced form of eq 22 in the absence of a free surface the additional increase of the frontal projected area b ζ is dismissed hence for an underwater vessel eq 22 is reduced to the following form 23 f 1 2 ρ a p u 2 sin 2 β 0 072 r e 1 5 s w a p where sin 2 β 1 1 2 ξ l b 2 as defined before for constructing the resistance curve of darpa suboff model eq 23 is used with ξ 0 35 the fresh water density and viscosity values are used and the projected area is calculated from a p l by setting l l o a for the submarine length fig 9 shows the resistance curves of darpa suboff submarine model according to the experimental data and eq 23 for ξ 0 35 the prediction agrees virtually perfectly with the measurements this must be basically due to the second order character of the experimental data we may also conclude that the absence of additional wave making resistance makes the agreement remarkably well otherwise above a definite threshold speed the presence of free surface changes the character of resistance curve to the third order 6 5 forces due to a current at an angle to a ship especially for ship manoeuvring simulations the estimation of wave and current forces at an angle to the ship is of primary importance eq 22 developed for the purpose of estimating ship resistance may well be adopted for such use here we shall outline the basic approach for such a possibility a detailed investigation exceeds the limits of this already lengthy treatment let it be remarked that for wave forces the unsteady mass or inertia force in 7 should be added to 22 while the friction drag can be neglected the current angle of attack relative to the bow is expressed as γ c ψ β c π where ψ is the heading angle of the ship and β c the current direction angle measured due north fossen 2011 p 153 accordingly the current velocity components in the x and y directions of a coordinate system fixed to the ship are u c v c cos γ c and v c v c sin γ c where v c is the current speed if the vessel is in motion the relative current speeds u r u u c and v r v v c must be used fossen 2011 p 125 27 then in terms of relative current speeds the external force components can be formulated from eq 22 as follows 24 f x 1 2 ρ a p x u r u r 1 b a p x sin 2 β x 2 g u r 2 sin 2 β x 0 072 r e x 1 5 s w a p x 25 f y 1 2 ρ a p y v r v r 1 l a p y sin 2 β y 2 g v r 2 sin 2 β y 0 072 r e y 1 5 s w a p y in the above formulas a p x l b t c b and a p y b l t c b are the mean cross sectional areas in the lengthwise and lateral directions of the ship the reynolds numbers for the x and y directions are r e x u r l ν and r e x v r b ν respectively sin 2 β x 1 1 2 ξ x l b 2 and sin 2 β y 1 1 2 ξ y b l 2 are the inertia force coefficients principally determined by the shape factors ξ x and ξ y for the x and y directions ξ x may be taken as determined according to the resistance characteristics of the ship which is shown to vary approximately in the range 0 30 0 45 ξ y on the other hand must be determined by comparisons with experimental measurements of definite ships or relevant statistical formulas u r u r and v r v r are used instead of u r 2 and v r 2 to account for correct force directions also the turning moment acting on the ship due to current can be formulated with the aid of f y as m c x g f y f y with x g f y denoting the distance between the horizontal centre of gravity of ship and the acting point of lateral force f y in this approach an empirical expression for x g f y as a percentage of ship length is necessary the munk moment in presence of current should also be accounted for properly finally it is worthwhile to note that eq 24 becomes identical with 22 when u r is equated to the ship speed u 7 concluding remarks an elementary treatment of wave and current forces and ship resistance has been done based on the first principles a general theoretical formulation of wave and current forces acting on an object has been accomplished by the use of 1 d momentum equation the resulting general expression renders morison s equation as a special case thus placing this equation on a solid theoretical ground furthermore the precise meaning of the drag force is clarified by observing it to be actually nothing more than the inertia drag or dynamic pressure drag the inertia drag coefficient of general expression is then modified for ship resistance calculations by following newton s arguments the effect of froude and reynolds scaling difference is removed by changing the reynolds number in a way that the resistance calculations for a ship and her model are consistent for the same tuning factor the resistance formula is tested for three different types of surface ships and a submarine against the experimental data with quite agreeable results this work however makes no pretence of proposing a precise formula for resistance calculations but rather of disclosing the essential physical mechanisms that lead to sound quantitative estimates further refinements in the formulations may be possible in the future by implementing the hints and suggestions made here especially concerning the wave making resistance bow stern wave interaction and more importantly change in resistance curve character of surface ships above a threshold speed the last issue apparently not brought up in the relevant literature yet seems to be the most challenging problem credit authorship contribution statement s beji

21352,a novel concept of wave energy converter cum breakwater is proposed consists of a multiple raft wave energy converter wec integrated with a floating breakwater fb which is termed as the integrated multi raft wave energy converter imr wec the imr wec allows the conversion of wave energy into electricity while protecting the coast from erosion due to wave impact a numerical model is developed to investigate the performance of the imr wec in energy generation and to study its effectiveness in attenuating the wave forces the effects of varying dimensions of the wec mooring stiffness wave periods and wave directions are studied to suggest the optimal design for the proposed imr wec to be most effective in generating energy and in protecting the coastal line both the regular waves and uni directional irregular waves for a tropical climate are considered in the paper the feasibility study shows that an appropriately sized imr wec is able to function both as a wave energy converter and a floating breakwater where an average capture width of greater than 1 50 m could be achieved in a typical tropical climate keywords raft type wave energy convertor floating breakwater wave climate hydroelasticity irregular wave 1 introduction tropical countries such as singapore indonesia the philippines maldives and seychelles have relatively mild sea state as compared to the subtropical and temperate zones nevertheless the shorelines of these countries are prone to coastal erosion because of the long term removal of sediments and rocks as a result of wave impact the world s largest archipelagic nation indonesia for example has experienced a loss of 29 261 ha of coastal areas amount to the size of its capital jakarta in the last 15 years due to erosion kahfi 2019 in view of this several methodologies such as the building of seawalls or revetments along the face of the mainland dean 2003 are proposed and utilized to prevent further coastline abrasion another common method to protect the coast from wave impact is via the construction of breakwaters along the shoreline hunt 1959 these breakwaters are found to be very effective in attenuating the wave force and thus serve as a seafront defence structure while the traditional bottom founded breakwater is preferred as means of wave attenuation device the floating breakwater mccartney 1985 tay et al 2009 koutandos et al 2005 has gained popularity over the past decades as it is environmentally friendly and allows for expansion and removal when the sea space is needed for other development purposes on the other hand the development of wave energy converters wec for utilization in the tropical sea state is at its infancy stage due to the low energy resources in these seas to make energy production economical nevertheless the annual wave energy resource in the tropical region such as the singapore sea amount to 47 2 gwh yr according to a study conducted by ly et al 2014 in 2014 this is equivalent to 120 000 public housing units annual electricity consumption of 400 kw in 2016 www ema gov sg thus presents a viable option as an alternative to fossil fuel in meeting the country s energy demand there are a few challenges that hinder the deployment of wec in tropical regions that have been outlined in felix et al 2019 from the technical ecological and social aspects the challenges are coupled with the over population in some of the tropical countries such as singapore manila and jakarta by taking a tiny nation such as singapore as an example proper development planning of the city and sea space is needed due to her land scarcity and urbanization problems as singapore is a global maritime port thereby the sea surrounding this island city is an important global shipping route this makes the deployment of wec subject to the consideration of sea space constraint and marine traffic congestion however the adverse effect of global warming resulting in the rise of seawater level pushes the need for all countries to play a role in mitigating the effect of climate change therefore a more efficient way of ocean space utilization has to be devised to achieve the interests of various stakeholders over the years integrated floating breakwater fb with wave energy converter wec has been proposed to utilize the ocean space more efficiently by integrating the fb with wec such solution is cost effective and is efficient in resource management as it optimizes the usage of the sea space similar ideas have been proposed by researchers for instance mustapa et al 2017 have presented a thorough review of this concept michailides and angelides 2012 also investigated the effectiveness of a flexible floating breakwater as a shore protection device and wec where they found that it is possible to achieve both functional requirements ning et al 2016 further proposed oscillating buoy type wave energy converter with a vertical pile restrained floating breakwater as a promising way to utilize wave energy in a more cost effectively manner in this paper the novel concept of wave energy convertor cum floating breakwater is proposed where a multiple raft type wec is integrated into a floating breakwater and is termed as the integrated multi raft type wec imr wec the imr wec comprises a series of equally spaced articulated plates such as those presented in tay 2017 2019 tay and wei 2019 nguyen et al 2019 liu et al 2017 and generates energy via its pitch motion as waves hit on it a power take off pto system is used to convert the mechanical motion into electricity falnes 2002 the raft type wec is found to be effective in generating wave energy under its optimal raft length and pto damping coefficient as shown by zheng et al zheng et al 2015 some other researchers also investigated the performance of the raft type wec of different pto systems liu et al 2018 noad and porter 2017 devised a new solution for the interaction of waves with an articulated raft and showed that the capture factor increases proportionally to the number of pontoons where more energy is generated by the raft with a shorter length a single raft type wave energy converter was first proposed in tay 2017 to be attached to a very large floating structure vlfs to function both as an anti motion device and wec where the results in the paper found that the energy generation of the articulated plate and its efficiency as an anti motion device depend significantly on the length of the articulated plate based on the effectiveness of the modular flap type wecs presented in wilkinson et al 2017 a modular wecs comprising multiple independent narrow flaps was then proposed in zhang et al 2019 to maximize the wave generation under oblique waves other concepts of wecs attached to a vlfs are covered comprehensively in nguyen et al 2020 the modular system similar to our proposed imr wec was found to display several advantages including the possibility of less expensive installation and smoother power generation as presented in zhang et al 2019 it is to note that the imr wec is similar to the raft type wec proposed by eco wave power www ecowavepower com however the paper shall investigate the raft type wec attached to a floating breakwater instead of a bottom founded breakwater as usually considered in other designs the advantage of the floating breakwater is profound as it allows the deployment in deeper water depth has minimal impacts towards the environment and does not disrupt the current flow the objectives of the paper are to investigate the feasibility of the imr wec in achieving two functionality requirements i e i converting wave energy into electricity ii protecting the coastal region from wave forces a numerical model is developed to investigate the performance of the imr wec in energy generation and to study its effectiveness in attenuating the wave forces the effects of varying dimensions of the wec mooring stiffness wave periods and wave directions are studied to suggest the optimal design for the proposed imr wec to be most effective in generating energy and in protecting the coastal line both the regular waves and uni directional irregular waves for a tropical climate modelled using the bretschneider bs wave spectrum are considered in the paper then a more practical l shape imr wec is considered to investigate the effectiveness of the wec cum fb when it is subjected to oblique sea and uni directional irregular waves 2 integrated multi raft wec the integrated multi raft wec is made of a series of equally spaced modular raft type wec hinged at one end to a box like floating breakwater the schematic diagram of the concept of the imr wec is presented in fig 1 the box like rectangular fb is moored at its four corners to the seabed by mooring lines modelled as springs with stiffness k m o o r i n g a total of n numbers of raft type wec are equally spaced at a spacing s p equals to the width of the wec i e s p w w e c the wecs are attached to the fb by hinge connectors that allow the wec to pitch as the wave hits on it the pto system is installed at the hinge connection joint in order to convert the mechanical motion into electricity the floating breakwater has a length of l f b and a constant width of w f b whereas the raft type wec has a length of l w e c and a width of w w e c the thicknesses of the fb and wec are d f b and d w e c respectively the wave and structural properties of the imr wec are presented in table 1 the imr wec is floating on water with a constant water depth of d 10 m the imr wec is assumed to be deployed close to the shipping port area as protection against wave forces these regions usually have a water depth of at least 10 m and the imr wec is placed about 100 m to the land port the effect of the regular wave is first investigated to study the basic hydrodynamic characteristics of the imr wec where it is assumed that the regular wave has a wave period t ranging from 3s to 12s and a wave amplitude a 1 m the waves approach the imr wec at an angle θ 0 30 45 and 60 with respect to the negative x axis as shown in fig 1 thereafter the irregular wave for a typical tropical sea modelled using the fetch limited bretschneider wave spectrum is investigated where the significant wave height h s 2 m and peak periods range from t p 3 0 s to 6 0s on the other hand both the wec and fb are modelled as solid thick plate where their structural deformation under wave action is taken into account the dimensions of the rectangular imr wec are given in table 1 where both fb and wec have a constant thickness of 2 m young s modulus of 11 9 gpa and mass density of 256 25 kg m3 the thicknesses of the fb and wec are assumed to be constant because the effectiveness of the fb in attenuating the wave forces is mostly affected by its width instead of its thickness as shown in tay et al 2009 the length of the fb is fixed at around 100 m for all four types of wecs considered note that the length of the fb for each of the four types of wecs is not exactly 100 m as shown in table 1 as the length depends on the spacing of the wecs it is also noted that the length of the fb i e l f b 100 m is taken to be at least twice the longest wavelength considered i e λ 48 4 m for t p 6 s when waves approach from the headsea this is to ensure that the length of the fb is at least one wavelength long in order to effectively attenuate the wave force approaching from the oblique sea as shown in fig 2 parametric studies are then performed by considering four types of raft type wecs attached to the fb namely type a type b type c and type d to investigate the effect of varying wec widths and numbers of wecs here type a comprises n 50 wecs with w w e c s p 1 m thus the length of the breakwater to accommodate these wecs is l f b 99 m similarly type b comprises n 25 wecs with w w e c s p 2 m and l f b 98 m type c comprises n 17 wecs with w w e c s p 2 94 m and l f b 99 m type d comprises n 10 wecs with w w e c s p 5 m and l f b 95 m it is important to note that the total waterplane areas a w p for all four types of wecs which are critical parameters correspond to the capture width that influence the performance of the wec are kept to be the same i e a w p 100 m2 the exciting and restoring forces are affected by the waterplane area thereby it is important to keep a w p the same to allow a fair comparison of the performance of the imr wec between the four types of wecs considered a more practical l shape imr wec subjected to regular and irregular waves is also considered to investigate its effectiveness in attenuating the wave forces and in extracting energy from the oblique waves and irregular sea the l shape imr wec has the same breakwater width and thickness young s modulus and mass density as those presented in table 1 it comprises two fbs arranged in an l shape configuration with each fb having a length of 98 m see fig 3 to house a total of 50 wecs the l shape fb is moored at all four corners of the rectangular fb each wec has a width w w e c 2 m length l w e c 2 m d w e c 2 m and is spaced s p 2 m apart 3 mathematical formulation 3 1 imr wec under regular wave 3 1 1 imr wec modelled using mindlin thick plate theory 3 1 1 1 governing equations for plate both the wec and fb are modelled as solid plates by using the mindlin thick plate theory tay 2009 tay et al 2007 the solid plate is assumed to be perfectly flat with free edges and the plate material is commonly assumed to be isotropic and obeys hooke s law according to the thick plate theory the response of the imr wec can be expressed by the deflection w x y the rotation about the y axis ψ x x y and the rotation about the x axis ψ y x y see fig 4 oñate 2013 with the governing equation given as follows 1 κ 2 g h 2 w x 2 2 w y 2 ψ x x ψ y y ρ p h ω 2 w p x y 2 d 1 ν 2 2 ψ x x 2 2 ψ y y 2 1 ν 2

correction factor is taken as 5 6 ρ p the mass density of the plate h the thickness of the plate taken to be the same as d f b d w e c d e h 2 12 1 ν 2 the flexural rigidity e the young s modulus ν the poisson ratio and ω 2 π t the wave frequency the pressure p x y in eq 1 comprises the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic pressure the boundary conditions at the free edges of the floating plate are 4 m

and normal directions to the section of the plate respectively 3 1 1 2 continuity equations for hinge connector with pto system the raft type wecs are hinged connected to the fb as shown in fig 1 the continuity equations for the interconnected plate at the hinge connector with pto damping b p t o located at x c w f b 2 are 7 w x x c w x x c 8 ψ y x x c ψ y x x c 9 m x x x c m x x x c 0 10 m x y x

system is attached at the connector to convert the kinetic energy of the wec due to wave action to electricity this is modelled as damper along the hinge connector i e y axis at x w f b 2 with pto damping value b p t o 3 1 1 3 modal expansion method by using the modal expansion method the plate motion w w ψ x ψ y can be expanded by a series of the product of the modal functions c l x y and their corresponding complex amplitudes ζ l 12 w x y l 1 p ζ l c l x y where ζ l is the amplitude of the l th mode of the freely vibrating plate the modal expansion method is used to decouple the coupled water plate equation the detail will be explained in section 3 1 3 3 1 2 simple potential flow the water domain is modelled by using the simple potential flow theory by assuming that the water is an ideal fluid where the water is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and its flow irrotational based on these assumptions the fluid motion may be represented by a velocity potential φ x y z t and oscillate in a steady state harmonic motion with the circular frequency ω the velocity potential φ x y z t could be expressed into the following form 13 φ x y z t r e φ x y z e i ω t the velocity potential φ can be expressed as the sum of the diffracted potential φ d and radiated potential by using the linear potential theory i e 14 φ x y z φ d l 1 p ζ l φ l x y z where the second term in the right hand side of eq 14 is the radiated potential expressed as a series of the product of the modal amplitude ζ l and the unit amplitude radiated potential φ l note that the complex amplitudes ζ l in eq 14 have the same value as their counterparts in eq 12 and the total number of modal functions p is taken to be the same the single frequency velocity potential φ x y z must satisfy the laplace

here that the p a in 25 is the normalised power absoption of the wecs with respect to the wave amplitude the power absorption p a is then expressed as capture width c w in eq 26 babarit and hals 2011

hence the bretschneider bs wave spectrum is considered for the modelling of the irregular wave the bs wave spectrum is a two parameter pierson moskowitz spectrum given as goda 2010 37 s ω 5 π 4 h s 2 t p 4 1 ω 5 e x p 20 π 4 t p 4 1 ω 4 where h s is the significant wave height and t p the peak wave period the root mean square of the average power absorption p a j r m s for the j th connector over the range of wave frequencies ω considered in the irregular wave can be obtained using the following expression 38 p a j r m s 0 p a j 2 s ω d ω the total average power absorption p a generated by the imr wec is then given by 39 p a 4 j p p a j r m s similarly the average wave elevation η for a single field point x surrounding the imr wec under irregular waves can be obtained as follows η x 2 0 η x 2 s ω d ω 4 results and discussions 4 1 verification of numerical model the numerical analysis of the current subject for the imr wec comprises two components i e the motions of the wec and fb and the wave elevation surrounding the imr wec as the wec and fb are modelled using the thick plate theory thus the flexible deformation of the structure under wave action termed the hydroelastic response has to be obtained the validation for the hydroelastic response and wave elevation surrounding a floating structure has been performed in tay 2009 by the same author and shall not be shown here due to the space constraint interested readers may refer to tay 2009 for the validation of the results 4 2 imr wec in regular waves the performance of the imr wec under regular waves is first assessed to do so the parametric investigation of the optimal b p t o that produces the maximum energy is investigated the optimal b p t o obtained from the parametric studies is then used to investigate the effects of various parameters such as wec width mooring stiffness breakwater width wave period and wec spacing have on the energy generation of the wec and the effectiveness of the breakwater in attenuating the wave forces 4 2 1 performance of imr wec 4 2 1 1 optimal b p t o the imr wec generates energy via a hydraulic pto system where the mechanical energy from the pitch motion is converted into electricity the force generated from the pto is linearly proportionate to the pto damping value which changes with respect to different frequencies i e wave periods by taking the box like type b imr wec as the default model with 25 units of raft type wecs spaced at 2 m apart and each wec having dimensions of l f b w f b d f b 2 m a parametric study is performed with the b p t o ranging from 0 to 25 kn m s to obtain the optimal b p t o value that produces the maximum wave energy i e maximum c w it is to note that these b p t o values are the power take off damping value for each wec attached to the fb the capture width c w of the imr wec for the various b p t o under four different wave directions i e θ 0 30 45 and 60 are presented in fig 5 a d respectively the contour boundaries for c w 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m are shown by the dotted dashed and solid lines in each sub figure of fig 5 respectively the results in fig 5 show that in general the imr wec produces significantly more energy under oblique direction this is because each raft type wec pitches at different magnitudes and phases under oblique waves as compared to the head sea thereby has the capability of generating more energy at a wider range of wave periods by comparing only the results under oblique wave condition it can be seen that the generated wave power increases to the maximum when θ 45 but starts to reduce when θ increases i e θ 60 because the pitch is smaller when the waves approach from a direction close to the beam sea θ 90 the results also show that the energy generation from the imr wec increases with the reduction of the wave periods i e smaller wavelengths this is because the raft type wecs pitch at a higher magnitude under smaller wavelength but oscillate at the same phase as the wave orbital motion when the wavelength is large thus explaining the smaller energy generation at a longer wavelength it is to note that similar findings were reported in the paper by wilkinson et al 2017 where they reported that the modular flap type wec is more effective in generating energy when subjected to waves with smaller wavelengths the optimal b p t o that results in the maximum c w for each wave period and wave direction are next extracted from fig 5 and plotted in fig 6 fig 6 shows the capture width c w of the imr wec represented as bubbles of varying sizes for its various optimal b p t o y axis and wave periods x axis as the power absorption under headsea is small only the c w of the imr wec under oblique waves are considered i e θ 30 45 and 60 the different sizes of the bubbles in fig 6 represents the varying average capture width c w where the size of the bubbles increases with the increase in c w the values for the c w corresponding to the bubbles sizes are given in the legend of fig 6 for a typical tropical wave period in southeast asia where t 6 s the range of optimal b p t o to achieve c w of at least 1 50 m is given in fig 6 the optimal b p t o for each wec falls in the range of 5 kn m s b p t o 13 kn m s the average value of this range of optimal b p t o is taken here i e 9 kn m s and this value shall be used as the default optimal b p t o for all the subsequent cases investigated in this paper 4 2 1 2 effect of varying wec widths by using the optimal b p t o obtained from the previous section the investigation is carried out to study the effect of varying wec widths w w e c have on the performance energy generation of the wec fig 7 shows the power absorption of the imr wec under four w w e c i e 1 m 2 m 2 94 m and 5 m for different wave directions θ in general all four plots in fig 7 show that the generated power decreases with the increase in wave period i e wavelength as the performance of the imr wec depends on the relative pitching angle between the wecs it can be seen that the imr wec is able to generate more power under oblique waves as compared to the headsea this is attributed to the greater relative pitching angle when waves arrive from the oblique direction resulting in each wec pitching at a different magnitude and phase angle thereby generating more power as waves pass by the wecs it is to be noted that the imr wec will generate more power under headsea if it is operating at sea state with wave periods closer to its natural periods thereby causing resonance this is shown later in fig 18 a close examination of the effect of w w e c shows that the imr wec produces more power with smaller w w e c this is because lower mass inertia is contained in the smaller wec thereby allowing the wec to pitch at a greater magnitude as wave impacts on the structure however the imr wec power production increases with the increase of w w e c under headsea this can be explained by referring to the relative pitching angle between the wecs for the imr wec under headsea all the wecs pitch with almost the same magnitude and phase hence the relative pitching angles between the wecs are zero in such a case more power could be generated by having wecs with wider w w e c to capture the waves that approach the imr wec the larger exciting force in the wider wec causes greater power production similar to the case of flap type wec tay and venugopal 2016 2017 2019 this finding is also proved experimentally by wilkinson et al 2017 where they reported that the flap type wec with wider width is 3 more efficient than its counterpart with smaller width under headsea whereas the latter wec generates 10 more energy in oblique sea condition 4 2 1 3 effect of varying mooring stiffnesses fig 1 a shows that the fb is moored at its four corners by mooring lines with the non dimensional mooring stiffness defined as k m o o r i n g k m o o r i n g ρ g l 2 where l is the characteristic length taken as l l w e c w f b the effect of varying mooring stiffnesses has on the performance of the imr wec is next investigated fig 8 shows the power absorption p a of the imr wec under headsea plotted with respect to different wave periods ranging from t 3 s to 12 s which correspond to a typical sea state in a tropical climate four mooring stiffnesses k m o o r i n g are investigated i e k m o o r i n g 0 1 2 10 it can be seen from fig 8 that more energy could be generated when the breakwater is moored by stiffer mooring lines this is because the fb is more stable and has a smaller motion when the mooring stiffness is large i e k m o o r i n g 10 thus resulting in the larger relative average pitch motion between the wecs and fb it is noted that k m o o r i n g 0 indicates that the fb is not moored under such condition the relative average pitch motion is found to be small due to the cancelling effect between the motion of the wecs and fb it is therefore important to keep the motion of the fb small by having a strong station keeping system in addition the minimal motion in the fb will ensure smaller radiated waves being generated 4 2 1 4 effect of varying wec lengths the performance of a wec is often expressed as the capture width which is the ratio of the power absorption to resource power given in eq 26 thus is significantly affected by the length of the wec fig 9 shows the effect of different l w e c has on the power absorption of the type b imr wec under an oblique wave of θ 30 it can be seen that the power absorption is the highest when the l w e c 2 m and l w e c 3 m but the p a drops when l w e c is either too small i e l w e c 1 m or too big i e l w e c 4 m it is interesting to note here that a wec is able to generate greater energy via its elastic deformation when the characteristic length of the structure is larger but a larger length would translate to a heavier structure thus damps the motion of the wec therefore the optimal length of the imr wec that allows maximum energy generation falls in between 2 m and 3 m as shown in fig 9 this is in agreement with the findings published in tay and wei 2019 where they have shown that the power absorption can be enhanced by allowing some flexibility in the floating structure 4 2 2 effectiveness of imr wec as a breakwater the effectiveness of the imr wec as a floating breakwater in attenuating the wave forces is next investigated the influences of three parameters i e wave period the spacing between wecs and breakwater width are being investigated in the subsequent sections note that for all cases the type b imr wec is considered i e n 25 w w e c 2 m l w e c 2 m w f b 2 m and l f b 98 m 4 2 2 1 effect of varying wave periods the wave period t is correlated with the wavelength by the wave dispersion equation given as 41 ω 2 g k tanh k h where ω is the wave frequency given as ω 2 π t k is the wavenumber given as k 2 π λ and d is the water depth therefore the wavelength λ increases with the increase in wave period t and vice versa the wave elevations η surrounding the imr wec when subjected to regular wave with t 3 5 s 4 0s 4 5s and 5 0s are shown in fig 10 a d respectively the incoming waves arrive from the headsea θ 0 it can be seen from fig 10 that the regular waves are diffracted by the imr wec especially at the corners of the structure at the same time the waves are also reflected by the imr wec resulting in higher wave elevation at the upstream of the structure the wave elevation is especially high at the region closes to the imr wec due to the interference between the incident and reflected waves thus resulting in standing waves in this region on the other hand the wave elevations are found to reduce at the downstream of the imr wec suggesting that the wave forces have been attenuated by the presence of the floating breakwater also it is evidenced from fig 10 that the reflected wave elevation is higher when the imr wec is subjected to wave of smaller wavelength i e smaller wave period as compared to its counterpart of the longer wavelength at the same time the fb is found to be more effective in attenuating the wave force when the wavelength is shorter these two phenomena can be explained by the wave diffraction theory maccamy and fuchs 1954 where more waves are being reflected and diffracted when the incoming waves have a shorter wavelength thus resulting in greater interferences between the waves it is to be noted that the fb is less effective when the wavelength is long due to the structure moving at the same phase as the incoming waves 4 2 2 2 effect of varying spacings between wecs in this paper it is assumed that the total waterplane area for the wecs is kept almost the same i e 100 m2 for all four types of imr wec considered in table 1 it is also assumed that the spacing s p between the wec is taken to be the same as the wec width w w e c figs 11 and 12 show the effect of varying spacings between the wecs has on the wave climate surrounding the imr wec when the imr wec is subjected to regular wave with t 3 5 s and 5 0 s respectively the widths of the wec considered are w w e c 1 m 2 m 2 94 m and 5 m and are plotted in the respective sub figure a b c and d of figs 11 and 12 fig 11 shows that the imr wec is insignificantly affected by the spacing of the wecs when the incoming wave arrives from the headsea this shows that the wave disturbance surrounding the imr wec is less affected by the numbers of wec considered as long as the total waterplane area and the breakwater width are kept the same this is because the difference in the power absorption is relatively small for headsea as compared to the oblique sea see fig 7 thus the wave disturbances surrounding the imr wec with different w w e c are small also the transmitted wave at the downstream of the imr wec depends significantly on the width of the breakwater whereas the reflected wave at the upstream is affected predominantly by the motion of the wec since the w f b that affects the attenuation of wave force and the waterplane area of the wec that influences the power absorption are kept the same the difference in the wave climate does not differ much for the different cases considered in figs 11 and 12 4 2 2 3 effect of varying wec lengths the effectiveness of the imr wec depends significantly on its length dimension in the x axis direction i e the w f b and l w e c as has been investigated by various researchers dong et al 2008 elchahal et al 2008 chen et al 2012 figs 13 and 14 show the wave elevation surrounding the imr wec under regular wave with t 3 5 s and 5 0s respectively in this case the oblique wave is being investigated to assess the influence of the varying l w e c compared to the findings in the wave climate presented in the previous section there is a distinct difference in the wave disturbance surrounding the imr wec when different wec lengths are used judging from the minimum wave elevation η in fig 13 it can be deduced that the wec with longer length is capable of attenuating greater wave forces as compared to their smaller length counterparts as more wave energy is being damped by the imr wec with longer length dimension in the x direction as a result more waves are being reflected by the imr wec with larger l w e c evidenced from the higher wave elevation located upstream of the floating structure in fig 13 fig 14 however shows that the effect of wec length is insignificant towards the wave climate and this is due to the imr wec behaving ineffectively when encountering an incoming wave with longer wavelength as longer waves having higher energy shall propagate pass the floating structure with minimal diffraction and reflection 4 3 l shape floating bw under different wave directions the more practical l shape imr wec as given in fig 3 is then considered the l shape imr wec allows the wec to extract energy and the fb to attenuate the wave force more effectively from wave coming in the oblique sea the dimensions of the l shape imr wec follow the basic dimensions of the type b imr wec considered in table 1 unless otherwise defined 4 3 1 performance 4 3 1 1 regular wave the performance of the l shape imr wec in terms of the power absorption is first obtained and plotted in fig 15 four different wave directions are considered i e θ 0 30 45 and 60 fig 15 shows that in general the power absorption reduces with the increase in the wave period i e longer wavelength this is because the raft type wecs pitch in phase with the orbital motion of the wave with a longer wavelength thus producing lesser energy also by configuring the iwr wec in an l shape configuration this allows the fb that faces the head sea and the oblique sea to extract the energy more effectively it can be seen from fig 15 that an almost consistent amount of wave energy is produced for all oblique waves considered this is very important as it allows consistent energy production for varying directional waves it is to note that the power produced by the imr wec is the highest when the waves arrive from θ 30 and 45 but the efficiency of the l shape imr wec drops slightly when the wave direction increases to θ 60 this is because of the slight difference between the length of the fb in x and y axes directions i e y axis direction having a length of 98 m and x axis direction having a length of 100 m see fig 3 thus might have influenced the hydrodynamic coefficients of the system 4 3 1 2 irregular waves next the performance of the imr wec under the uni directional bretschneider bs wave spectrum is studied fig 16 shows the comparisons between the bs wave spectra and the power absorption p a for the l shape imr wec under varying regular wave frequencies ranging from 0 05 rad s to 4 0 rad s with θ 0 30 45 and 60 the plot for six different bs wave spectra with peak wave periods t p 3 0 s 3 5 s 4 0 s 5 0 s 5 5 s and 6 0s are given in fig 16 the power absorption p a from the regular wave is obtained from eq 25 fig 16 shows that the imr wec has the highest power absorption for θ 0 under high frequency waves however as the encountering peak wave frequency for the uni directional irregular wave sea state being considered for the tropical climate are smaller than 2 1 rad s i e greater than t p 3 0 s thus more energy is instead being generated in the oblique wave when a sea state with t p 3 s is considered as presented in fig 17 fig 17 shows that the average power absorption p a generated from the imr wec increases with the increase in wave direction except for the t p 3 0 s and 3 5 s where the imr wec produces the greatest energy under headsea the reason for this phenomenon is due to resonance that occurs at 1 57 s and 2 13 s see fig 18 for the l shape imr wec fig 18 shows that the power absorption p a for the imr wec plotted against the regular wave periods the p a is found to increase with the wave direction except when the imr wec is operating at sea state with wave periods close to its natural periods it is interesting to note that the l shape imr wec is excited at its two natural periods at t 3 s these range of wave periods are not considered in the regular wave analysis but have to be considered in the response spectrum analysis for irregular waves 4 3 2 wave climate 4 3 2 1 regular wave the wave disturbance around the imr wec under regular waves for t 3 5 s and t 5 0 s are compared in figs 19 and 20 respectively the wave directions considered are θ 0 30 45 and 60 figs 19 and 20 show that the floating breakwater is more effective when operating at sea state with smaller wave period i e small wavelength due to the greater amount of diffracted wave generated under smaller wave condition the results also show that the efficiency of the l shape fb in attenuating the wave forces reduces with the increase in wave angle θ this could be due to the constructive interference of the transmitted wave located downstream of the l shape fb resulting in an amplification of wave amplitudes however it is interesting to note that the maximum wave elevation due to the reflected waves reduces as compared to its counterpart of a one sided fb shown in section 4 2 this shows that the destructive interference occurs at the upstream of the l shape configuration thus producing a smaller wave amplitude amplification in the reflected waves 4 3 2 2 irregular wave the wave climate surrounding the l shape imr wec under irregular wave is next investigated figs 21 and 22 show the average wave elevation η surrounding the l shape imr wec for headsea θ 0 and oblique wave θ 30 respectively the wave period t p considered are t p 3 0 s 3 5s 4 0s 5 0s 5 5s and 6 0 s the wave elevations along the cross sections cs of the wavefield are also plotted in each figure the reduction in the wave elevation is found to be significant when t p is small evidenced from figs 21 and 22 but the effectiveness in attenuating the wave forces is found to reduce when t p increases it can be seen from the wave elevation along the cs1 y 0 fig 21 that the waves are being reflected by the fb causing interference of waves upstream of the fb and attenuation of waves downstream the fb the wave elevations are found to increase significantly at the upstream close to the fb followed by a decrease in the wave elevation downstream the fb this is also observed along cs3 in fig 22 which is taken along the direction of the incident wave propagation at θ 30 that passes the origin x 0 y 0 the wave elevation along cs1 also shows that the fb has minimal effect on the incoming waves when the wavelength is long i e t p 5 s and 6 s in fig 21 by comparing the wave elevation along cs1 and cs2 in fig 21 it can be seen that the wave elevation along cs2 is lower than its counterpart along cs1 this is because of the presence of the fb in the x axis direction close to cs2 thus contributes to dampening the wave forces likewise it can be seen from fig 22 that the wave elevation along cs2 x 90 m has an increasing wave elevation amplitude when it is further away from the fb an interesting finding is that not only the transmitted wave but also the reflected wave could be effectively reduced by the l shape imr wec through the destructive wave interference produced by the l shape configuration this is important as the reflected waves from the imr wec will cause unwanted disturbance to other offshore activities in the upstream of the imr wec figs 23 and 24 show the wave disturbances surrounding the l shape imr wec when the mooring stiffness is increased to k m o o r i n g 10 under θ 0 and 30 respectively this is to investigate the effectiveness of the fb when they are moored with a high stiffness such that the motion of the fb is minimal only t p of 3 0s 3 5s and 4 0s are considered here as the fb is more effective when the wavelength is small it can be seen that there is a significant decrease in the wave elevations downstream the imr wec in figs 23 and 24 as compared to their counterparts in figs 21 and 22 this finding shows that it is important to keep the motion of the fb small in order to minimise the contribution of wave disturbances from the fb 5 conclusion an integrated multi raft wave energy convertor was proposed to generate clean energy from wave and to protect the coast from erosion due to wave impact the energy was produced by a power take off system installed at the hinge connector that joins the wecs and the fb numerical investigations on the performance of the imr wec and wave disturbance surrounding the floating system under regular and irregular were successfully investigated the findings for the various parametric studies are summarized as follows wec width generally the power absorption from the imr wec decreases with the increase in wavelength due to the imr wec moving in phase with the orbital motion of the wave under oblique wave the imr wec generates more power with a smaller wec width due to its lower mass inertia i e larger motion mooring stiffness the imr wec was found to generate more energy when the fb is moored by lines with higher stiffness due to the greater relative motion between the wecs and the more stable fb the more stable fb with minimal motion will ensure smaller radiated waves being generated and this is important for the fb in protecting the coastal lines wec length it was found that an ideal wec length to generate greater energy falls in between 2 m and 3 m a shorter wec does not have sufficient inertia to generate energy whereas a long wec is too heavy to pitch thus resulting in smaller energy generation wave periods the imr wec was found to be more effective in attenuating the wave forces when the structure is subjected to wave of smaller wavelength i e smaller wave period due to the larger diffracted and radiated waves generated the investigation of the l shape imr wec under regular and irregular waves showed that the l shape imr wec is very effective in generating energy from wave coming from the oblique direction the study also showed that the l shape imr wec is effective when the peak wave period is small i e smaller wavelength but the difference in the energy generated at higher peak wave period value is insignificant for different wave directions the concept of integrating wave energy converter with floating breakwater is beneficial for coastal cities as it protects the coastlines from erosion and at the same time allows the conversion of wave energy into clean electricity the proposed imr wec was shown to be very effective in tropical climate via the numerical investigation presented a second order wave analysis shall be conducted in the future to investigate the performance and wave

21352,a novel concept of wave energy converter cum breakwater is proposed consists of a multiple raft wave energy converter wec integrated with a floating breakwater fb which is termed as the integrated multi raft wave energy converter imr wec the imr wec allows the conversion of wave energy into electricity while protecting the coast from erosion due to wave impact a numerical model is developed to investigate the performance of the imr wec in energy generation and to study its effectiveness in attenuating the wave forces the effects of varying dimensions of the wec mooring stiffness wave periods and wave directions are studied to suggest the optimal design for the proposed imr wec to be most effective in generating energy and in protecting the coastal line both the regular waves and uni directional irregular waves for a tropical climate are considered in the paper the feasibility study shows that an appropriately sized imr wec is able to function both as a wave energy converter and a floating breakwater where an average capture width of greater than 1 50 m could be achieved in a typical tropical climate keywords raft type wave energy convertor floating

to the subtropical and temperate zones nevertheless the shorelines of these countries are prone to coastal erosion because of the long term removal of sediments and rocks as a result of wave impact the world s largest archipelagic nation indonesia for example has experienced a loss of 29 261 ha of coastal areas amount to the size of its capital jakarta in the last 15 years due to erosion kahfi 2019 in view of this several methodologies such as the building of seawalls or revetments along the face of the mainland dean 2003 are proposed and utilized to prevent further coastline abrasion another common method to protect the coast from wave impact is via the construction of breakwaters along the shoreline hunt 1959 these breakwaters are found to be very effective in attenuating the wave force and thus serve as a seafront defence structure while the traditional bottom founded breakwater is preferred as means of wave attenuation device the floating breakwater mccartney 1985 tay et al 2009 koutandos et al 2005 has gained popularity over the past decades as it is environmentally friendly and allows for expansion and removal when the sea space is needed for other development purposes on the other hand the development of wave energy converters wec for utilization in the tropical sea state is at its infancy stage due to the low energy resources in these seas to make energy production economical nevertheless the annual wave energy resource in the tropical region such as the singapore sea amount to 47 2 gwh yr according to a study conducted by ly et al 2014 in 2014 this is equivalent to 120 000 public housing units annual electricity consumption of 400 kw in 2016 www ema gov sg thus presents a viable option as an alternative to fossil fuel in meeting the country s energy demand there are a few challenges that hinder the deployment of wec in tropical regions that have been outlined in felix et al 2019 from the technical ecological and social aspects the challenges are coupled with the over population in some of the tropical countries such as singapore manila and jakarta by taking a tiny nation such as singapore as an example proper development planning of the city and sea space is needed due to her land scarcity and urbanization problems as singapore is a global maritime port thereby the sea surrounding this island city is an important global shipping route this makes the deployment of wec subject to the consideration of sea space constraint and marine traffic congestion however the adverse effect of global warming resulting in the rise of seawater level pushes the need for all countries to play a role in mitigating the effect of climate change therefore a more efficient way of ocean space utilization has to be devised to achieve the interests of various stakeholders over the years integrated floating breakwater fb with wave energy converter wec has been proposed to utilize the ocean space more efficiently by integrating the fb with wec such solution is cost effective and is efficient in resource management as it optimizes the usage of the sea space similar ideas have been proposed by researchers for instance mustapa et al 2017 have presented a thorough review of this concept michailides and angelides 2012 also investigated the effectiveness of a flexible floating breakwater as a shore protection device and wec where they found that it is possible to achieve both functional requirements ning et al 2016 further proposed oscillating buoy type wave energy converter with a vertical pile restrained floating breakwater as a promising way to utilize wave energy in a more cost effectively manner in this paper the novel concept of wave energy convertor cum floating breakwater is proposed where a multiple raft type wec is integrated into a floating breakwater and is termed as the integrated multi raft type wec imr wec the imr wec comprises a series of equally spaced articulated plates such as those presented in tay 2017 2019 tay and wei 2019 nguyen et al 2019 liu et al 2017 and generates energy via its pitch motion as waves hit on it a power take off pto system is used to convert the mechanical motion into electricity falnes 2002 the raft type wec is found to be effective in generating wave energy under its optimal raft length and pto damping coefficient as shown by zheng et al zheng et al 2015 some other researchers also investigated the performance of the raft type wec of different pto systems liu et al 2018 noad and porter 2017 devised a new solution for the interaction of waves with an articulated raft and showed that the capture factor increases proportionally to the number of pontoons where more energy is generated by the raft with a shorter length a single raft type wave energy converter was first proposed in tay 2017 to be attached to a very large floating structure vlfs to function both as an anti motion device and wec where the results in the paper found that the energy generation of the articulated plate and its efficiency as an anti motion device depend significantly on the length of the articulated plate based on the effectiveness of the modular flap type wecs presented in wilkinson et al 2017 a modular wecs comprising multiple independent narrow flaps was then proposed in zhang et al 2019 to maximize the wave generation under oblique waves other concepts of wecs attached to a vlfs are covered comprehensively in nguyen et al 2020 the modular system similar to our proposed imr wec was found to display several advantages including the possibility of less expensive installation and smoother power generation as presented in zhang et al 2019 it is to note that the imr wec is similar to the raft type wec proposed by eco wave power www ecowavepower com however the paper shall investigate the raft type wec attached to a floating breakwater instead of a bottom founded breakwater as usually considered in other designs the advantage of the floating breakwater is profound as it allows the deployment in deeper water depth has minimal impacts towards the environment and does not disrupt the current flow the objectives of the paper are to investigate the feasibility of the imr wec in achieving two functionality requirements i e i converting wave energy into electricity ii protecting the coastal region from wave forces a numerical model is developed to investigate the performance of the imr wec in energy generation and to study its effectiveness in attenuating the wave forces the effects of varying dimensions of the wec mooring stiffness wave periods and wave directions are studied to suggest the optimal design for the proposed imr wec to be most effective in generating energy and in protecting the coastal line both the regular waves and uni directional irregular waves for a tropical climate modelled using the bretschneider bs wave spectrum are considered in the paper then a more practical l shape imr wec is considered to investigate the effectiveness of the wec cum fb when it is subjected to oblique sea and uni directional irregular waves 2 integrated multi raft wec the integrated multi raft wec is made of a series of equally spaced modular raft type wec hinged at one end to a box like floating breakwater the schematic diagram of the concept of the imr wec is presented in fig 1 the box like rectangular fb is moored at its four corners to the seabed by mooring lines modelled as springs with stiffness k m o o r i n g a total of n numbers of raft type wec are equally spaced at a spacing s p equals to the width of the wec i e s p w w e c the wecs are attached to the fb by hinge connectors that allow the wec to pitch as the wave hits on it the pto system is installed at the hinge connection joint in order to convert the mechanical motion into electricity the floating breakwater has a length of l f b and a constant width of w f b whereas the raft type wec has a length of l w e c and a width of w w e c the thicknesses of the fb and wec are d f b and d w e c respectively the wave and structural properties of the imr wec are presented in table 1 the imr wec is floating on water with a constant water depth of d 10 m the imr wec is assumed to be deployed close to the shipping port area as protection against wave forces these regions usually have a water depth of at least 10 m and the imr wec is placed about 100 m to the land port the effect of the regular wave is first investigated to study the basic hydrodynamic characteristics of the imr wec where it is assumed that the regular wave has a wave period t ranging from 3s to 12s and a wave amplitude a 1 m the waves approach the imr wec at an angle θ 0 30 45 and 60 with respect to the negative x axis as shown in fig 1 thereafter the irregular wave for a typical tropical sea modelled using the fetch limited bretschneider wave spectrum is investigated where the significant wave height h s 2 m and peak periods range from t p 3 0 s to 6 0s on the other hand both the wec and fb are modelled as solid thick plate where their structural deformation under wave action is taken into account the dimensions of the rectangular imr wec are given in table 1 where both fb and wec have a constant thickness of 2 m young s modulus of 11 9 gpa and mass density of 256 25 kg m3 the thicknesses of the fb and wec are assumed to be constant because the effectiveness of the fb in attenuating the wave forces is mostly affected by its width instead of its thickness as shown in tay et al 2009 the length of the fb is fixed at around 100 m for all four types of wecs considered note that the length of the fb for each of the four types of wecs is not exactly 100 m as shown in table 1 as the length depends on the spacing of the wecs it is also noted that the length of the fb i e l f b 100 m is taken to be at least twice the longest wavelength considered i e λ 48 4 m for t p 6 s when waves approach from the headsea this is to ensure that the length of the fb is at least one wavelength long in order to effectively attenuate the wave force approaching from the oblique sea as shown in fig 2 parametric studies are then performed by considering four types of raft type wecs attached to the fb namely type a type b type c and type d to investigate the effect of varying wec widths and numbers of wecs here type a comprises n 50 wecs with w w e c s p 1 m thus the length of the breakwater to accommodate these wecs is l f b 99 m similarly type b comprises n 25 wecs with w w e c s p 2 m and l f b 98 m type c comprises n 17 wecs with w w e c s p 2 94 m and l f b 99 m type d comprises n 10 wecs with w w e c s p 5 m and l f b 95 m it is important to note that the total waterplane areas a w p for all four types of wecs which are critical parameters correspond to the capture width that influence the performance of the wec are kept to be the same i e a w p 100 m2 the exciting and restoring forces are affected by the waterplane area thereby it is important to keep a w p the same to allow a fair comparison of the performance of the imr wec between the four types of wecs considered a more practical l shape imr wec subjected to regular and irregular waves is also considered to investigate its effectiveness in attenuating the wave forces and in extracting energy from the oblique waves and irregular sea the l shape imr wec has the same breakwater width and thickness young s modulus and mass density as those presented in table 1 it comprises two fbs arranged in an l shape configuration with each fb having a length of 98 m see fig 3 to house a total of 50 wecs the l shape fb is moored at all four corners of the rectangular fb each wec has a width w w e c 2 m length l w e c 2 m d w e c 2 m and is spaced s p 2 m apart 3 mathematical formulation 3 1 imr wec under regular wave 3 1 1 imr wec modelled using mindlin thick plate theory 3 1 1 1 governing equations for plate both the wec and fb are modelled as solid plates by using the mindlin thick plate theory tay 2009 tay et al 2007 the solid plate is assumed to be perfectly flat with free edges and the plate material is commonly assumed to be isotropic and obeys hooke s law according to the thick plate theory the response of the imr wec can be expressed by the deflection w x y the rotation about the y axis ψ x x y and the rotation about the x axis ψ y x y see fig 4 oñate 2013 with the governing equation given as follows 1 κ 2 g h 2 w x 2 2 w y 2 ψ x x ψ y y ρ p h ω 2 w p x y 2 d 1 ν 2 2 ψ x x 2 2 ψ y y 2 1 ν 2

and normal directions to the section of the plate respectively 3 1 1 2 continuity equations for hinge connector with pto system the raft type wecs are hinged connected to the fb as shown in fig 1 the

system is attached at the connector to convert the kinetic energy of the wec due to wave action to electricity this is modelled as damper along the hinge connector i e y axis at x w f b 2 with pto damping value b p t o 3 1 1 3 modal expansion method by using the modal expansion method the plate motion w w ψ x ψ y can be expanded by a series of the product of the modal functions c l x y and their corresponding complex amplitudes ζ l 12 w x y l 1 p ζ l c l x y where ζ l is the amplitude of the l th mode of the freely vibrating plate the modal expansion method is used to decouple the coupled water plate equation the detail will be explained in section 3 1 3 3 1 2 simple potential flow the water domain is modelled by using the simple potential flow theory by assuming that the water is an ideal fluid where the water is assumed to be inviscid incompressible and its flow irrotational based on these assumptions the fluid motion may be represented by a velocity potential φ x y z t and oscillate in a steady state harmonic motion with the circular frequency ω the velocity potential φ x y z t could be expressed into the following form 13 φ x y z t r e φ x y z e i ω t the velocity potential φ can be expressed as the sum of the diffracted potential φ d and radiated potential by using the linear potential theory i e 14 φ x y z φ d l 1 p ζ l φ l x y z where the second term in the right hand side of eq 14 is the radiated potential expressed as a series of the product of the modal amplitude ζ l and the unit amplitude radiated potential φ l note that the complex amplitudes ζ l in eq 14 have the same value as their counterparts in eq 12 and the total number of modal functions p is taken to be the same the single frequency velocity potential φ x y z must satisfy the laplace equation 15 faltinsen 1993 and the boundary conditions on the surfaces as shown in fig 1 15 2 φ 0 in ω these boundary conditions are given as follows faltinsen 1993 16 φ l z i ω c l for l 1 2 p 0 for l d on s w b 17 φ l n 0 on s w s 18 φ l z ω 2 φ g on s f 19 φ l z 0 s b where the velocity potential φ l with subscript l d denotes the diffracted potential and l 1 p denotes the radiated potential n is the unit normal vector to the surface s and p the total number of modal functions considered in the analysis s w b s w s s w where s w b and s w s are the bottom and side wetted surface of the floating body the wave velocity potential must also satisfy the sommerfield radiation condition at the artificial fluid boundary at infinity s as x y faltinsen 1993 20 lim x y x y x y i k φ φ i n 0 on s where k and φ i n are the standard wave number and incident velocity potential as found in faltinsen 1993 the laplace equation 15 together with the boundary conditions 16 to 20 on the surface s is transformed into a boundary integral equation bie by using the green s 2nd theorem via a free surface green s function given in lee and newman 2006 that satisfies the boundary conditions at the free water surface s f the seabed s b and at the infinity s hence only the wetted surface of the bodies s w need to be discretised into panels so that the boundary element method could be used to solve for the diffracted and radiated potential the bie is given as 21 c φ l x s h g n x x φ l d s s h g x x φ l n x d s where c is the solid angle taken as 2 π if the velocity potential is distributed on the wetted surface and 4 π on the water free surface the free surface green s function g can be found in the wamit manual lee and newman 2006 the sources are assumed to be distributed at x x y z on the wetted panel and at x x y z on the field points by substituting the boundary condition 16 at the wetted surface into the bie in eq 21 the bie is then given as 22 2 π φ l x s w g n x x φ l x d s i ω s w g x x c l x d s for l 1 2 p 2 π φ i n for l d for details on the green s function used in solving the bie refer to babarit and hals 2011 3 1 3 equation of motion for water plate model the coupled water structure problem is solved by using the coupled boundary element finite element scheme where the laplace equation together with the water boundary conditions are solved using the boundary element method whereas the plate equation and its boundary conditions using the finite element method due to space constraints details of the solution scheme are not presented here but interested readers can refer to the details in tay 2009 gao et al 2011 the decoupled equation of motion of the water structure problem can be written as 23 ω 2 m m a i ω b a b p t o k f k s k r f k m o o r i n g c l f e where m is the mass k f the flexural stiffness k s the shear stiffness k r f the restoring force and k m o o r i n g the mooring stiffness the added mass m a radiated damping b a and exciting force f e can be found in tay 2009 and will not be presented here due to its lengthy derivation the equation can be further transformed into the matrix form to be solved for the modal functions c l x y using the finite element method these values are then back substituted into eq 12 to obtain the plate deflection w the typical b p t o matrix of an interconnected node j in the hinge connector is presented as follows 24 b p t o j w ψ x ψ x ψ y ψ y w ψ x ψ x ψ y ψ y 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 b p t o b p t o b p t o b p t o it is noted here that for each node along with the line connector there will be five degrees of freedom namely w ψ x ψ x ψ y and ψ y the positive and negative signs denote the right hand side and left hand side of the node in the line connector 3 1 4 power absorption the rotation of the hinge connector ψ x calculated from eq 23 can be used to compute the power absorption p a of the wec following expression 25 p a 1 2 ω 2 b p t o j n ψ y j 2 it is noted here that the p a in 25 is the normalised power absoption of the wecs with respect to the wave amplitude the power absorption p a is then expressed as capture width c w in eq 26 babarit and hals 2011 by normalising with the wave power resource p r e s o u r c e 27 in order to quantify the efficiency of the wec in generating wave energy 26 c w p a p r e s o u r c e the c w is the width of a wave crest that contains the same p a as extracted by a wec and the c w has to be as large as possible for the wec to be effective in generating wave energy the wave power resource p r e s o u r c e in eq 26 is given as goda 2010 27 p r e s o u r c e ρ g 2 t p h s 2 64 π where ρ is the mass density of seawater g the gravitational acceleration t p the wave period and h s the significant wave height here we define an average capture width c w 28 which is the normalisation of the c w eq 26 with respect to the number of wecs in the fb to quantify the effectiveness of each wec in the fb 28 c w c w n 3 1

hence the bretschneider bs wave spectrum is considered for the modelling of the irregular wave the bs wave spectrum is a two parameter pierson moskowitz spectrum given as goda 2010 37 s ω 5 π 4 h s 2 t p 4 1 ω 5 e x p 20 π 4 t p 4 1 ω 4 where h s is the significant wave height and t p the peak wave period the root mean square of the average power absorption p a j r m s for the j th connector over the range of wave frequencies ω considered in the irregular wave can be obtained using the following expression 38 p a j r m s 0 p a j 2 s ω d ω the total average power absorption p a generated by the imr wec is then given by 39 p a 4 j p p a j r m s similarly the average wave elevation η for a single field point x surrounding the imr wec under irregular waves can be obtained as follows η x 2 0 η x 2 s ω d ω 4 results and discussions 4 1 verification of numerical model the numerical analysis of the current subject for the imr wec comprises two components i e the motions of the wec and fb and the wave elevation surrounding the imr wec as the wec and fb are modelled using the thick plate theory thus the flexible deformation of the structure under wave action termed the hydroelastic response has to be obtained the validation for the hydroelastic response and wave elevation surrounding a floating structure has been performed in tay 2009 by the same author and shall not be shown here due to the space constraint interested readers may refer to tay 2009 for the validation of the results 4 2 imr wec in regular waves the performance of the imr wec under regular waves is first assessed to do so the parametric investigation of the optimal b p t o that produces the maximum energy is investigated the optimal b p t o obtained from the parametric studies is then used to investigate the effects of various parameters such as wec width mooring stiffness breakwater width wave period and wec spacing have on the energy generation of the wec and the effectiveness of the breakwater in attenuating the wave forces 4 2 1 performance of imr wec 4 2 1 1 optimal b p t o the imr wec generates energy via a hydraulic pto system where the mechanical energy from the pitch motion is converted into electricity the force generated from the pto is linearly proportionate to the pto damping value which changes with respect to different frequencies i e wave periods by taking the box like type b imr wec as the default model with 25 units of raft type wecs spaced at 2 m apart and each wec having dimensions of l f b w f b d f b 2 m a parametric study is performed with the b p t o ranging from 0 to 25 kn m s to obtain the optimal b p t o value that produces the maximum wave energy i e maximum c w it is to note that these b p t o values are the power take off damping value for each wec attached to the fb the capture width c w of the imr wec for the various b p t o under four different wave directions i e θ 0 30 45 and 60 are presented in fig 5 a d respectively the contour boundaries for c w 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 0 m are shown by the dotted dashed and solid lines in each sub figure of fig 5 respectively the results in fig 5 show that in general the imr wec produces significantly more energy under oblique direction this is because each raft type wec pitches at different magnitudes and phases under oblique waves as compared to the head sea thereby has the capability of generating more energy at a wider range of wave periods by comparing only the results under oblique wave condition it can be seen that the generated wave power increases to the maximum when θ 45 but starts to reduce when θ increases i e θ 60 because the pitch is smaller when the waves approach from a direction close to the beam sea θ 90 the results also show that the energy generation from the imr wec increases with the reduction of the wave periods i e smaller wavelengths this is because the raft type wecs pitch at a higher magnitude under smaller wavelength but oscillate at the same phase as the wave orbital motion when the wavelength is large thus explaining the smaller energy generation at a longer wavelength it is to note that similar findings were reported in the paper by wilkinson et al 2017 where they reported that the modular flap type wec is more effective in generating energy when subjected to waves with smaller wavelengths the optimal b p t o that results in the maximum c w for each wave period and wave direction are next extracted from fig 5 and plotted in fig 6 fig 6 shows the capture width c w of the imr wec represented as bubbles of varying sizes for its various optimal b p t o y axis and wave periods x axis as the power absorption under headsea is small only the c w of the imr wec under oblique waves are considered i e θ 30 45 and 60 the different sizes of the bubbles in fig 6 represents the varying average capture width c w where the size of the bubbles increases with the increase in c w the values for the c w corresponding to the bubbles sizes are given in the legend of fig 6 for a typical tropical wave period in southeast asia where t 6 s the range of optimal b p t o to achieve c w of at least 1 50 m is given in fig 6 the optimal b p t o for each wec falls in the range of 5 kn m s b p t o 13 kn m s the average value of this range of optimal b p t o is taken here i e 9 kn m s and this value shall be used as the default optimal b p t o for all the subsequent cases investigated in this paper 4 2 1 2 effect of varying wec widths by using the optimal b p t o obtained from the previous section the investigation is carried out to study the effect of varying wec widths w w e c have on the performance energy generation of the wec fig 7 shows the power absorption of the imr wec under four w w e c i e 1 m 2 m 2 94 m and 5 m for different wave directions θ in general all four plots in fig 7 show that the generated power decreases with the increase in wave period i e wavelength as the performance of the imr wec depends on the relative pitching angle between the wecs it can be seen that the imr wec is able to generate more power under oblique waves as compared to the headsea this is attributed to the greater relative pitching angle when waves arrive from the oblique direction resulting in each wec pitching at a different magnitude and phase angle thereby generating more power as waves pass by the wecs it is to be noted that the imr wec will generate more power under headsea if it is operating at sea state with wave periods closer to its natural periods thereby causing resonance this is shown later in fig 18 a close examination of the effect of w w e c shows that the imr wec produces more power with smaller w w e c this is because lower mass inertia is contained in the smaller wec thereby allowing the wec to pitch at a greater magnitude as wave impacts on the structure however the imr wec power production increases with the increase of w w e c under headsea this can be explained by referring to the relative pitching angle between the wecs for the imr wec under headsea all the wecs pitch with almost the same magnitude and phase hence the relative pitching angles between the wecs are zero in such a case more power could be generated by having wecs with wider w w e c to capture the waves that approach the imr wec the larger exciting force in the wider wec causes greater power production similar to the case of flap type wec tay and venugopal 2016 2017 2019 this finding is also proved experimentally by wilkinson et al 2017 where they reported that the flap type wec with wider width is 3 more efficient than its counterpart with smaller width under headsea whereas the latter wec generates 10 more energy in oblique sea condition 4 2 1 3 effect of varying mooring stiffnesses fig 1 a shows that the fb is moored at its four corners by mooring lines with the non dimensional mooring stiffness defined as k m o o r i n g k m o o r i n g ρ g l 2 where l is the characteristic length taken as l l w e c w f b the effect of varying mooring stiffnesses has on the performance of the imr wec is next investigated fig 8 shows the power absorption p a of the imr wec under headsea plotted with respect to different wave periods ranging from t 3 s to 12 s which correspond to a typical sea state in a tropical climate four mooring stiffnesses k m o o r i n g are investigated i e k m o o r i n g 0 1 2 10 it can be seen from fig 8 that more energy could be generated when the breakwater is moored by stiffer mooring lines this is because the fb is more stable and has a smaller motion when the mooring stiffness is large i e k m o o r i n g 10 thus resulting in the larger relative average pitch motion between the wecs and fb it is noted that k m o o r i n g 0 indicates that the fb is not moored under such condition the relative average pitch motion is found to be small due to the cancelling effect between the motion of the wecs and fb it is therefore important to keep the motion of the fb small by having a strong station keeping system in addition the minimal motion in the fb will ensure smaller radiated waves being generated 4 2 1 4 effect of varying wec lengths the performance of a wec is often expressed as the capture width which is the ratio of the power absorption to resource power given in eq 26 thus is significantly affected by the length of the wec fig 9 shows the effect of different l w e c has on the power absorption of the type b imr wec under an oblique wave of θ 30 it can be seen that the power absorption is the highest when the l w e c 2 m and l w e c 3 m but the p a drops when l w e c is either too small i e l w e c 1 m or too big i e l w e c 4 m it is interesting to note here that a wec is able to generate greater energy via its elastic deformation when the characteristic length of the structure is larger but a larger length would translate to a heavier structure thus damps the motion of the wec therefore the optimal length of the imr wec that allows maximum energy generation falls in between 2 m and 3 m as shown in fig 9 this is in agreement with the findings published in tay and wei 2019 where they have shown that the power absorption can be enhanced by allowing some flexibility in the floating structure 4 2 2 effectiveness of imr wec as a breakwater the effectiveness of the imr wec as a floating breakwater in attenuating the wave forces is next investigated the influences of three parameters i e wave period the spacing between wecs and breakwater width are being investigated in the subsequent sections note that for all cases the type b imr wec is considered i e n 25 w w e c 2 m l w e c 2 m w f b 2 m and l f b 98 m 4 2 2 1 effect of varying wave periods the wave period t is correlated with the wavelength by the wave dispersion equation given as 41 ω 2 g k tanh k h where ω is the wave frequency given as ω 2 π t k is the wavenumber given as k 2 π λ and d is the water depth therefore the wavelength λ increases with the increase in wave period t and vice versa the wave elevations η surrounding the imr wec when subjected to regular wave with t 3 5 s 4 0s 4 5s and 5 0s are shown in fig 10 a d respectively the incoming waves arrive from the headsea θ 0 it can be seen from fig 10 that the regular waves are diffracted by the imr wec especially at the corners of the structure at the same time the waves are also reflected by the imr wec resulting in higher wave elevation at the upstream of the structure the wave elevation is especially high at the region closes to the imr wec due to the interference between the incident and reflected waves thus resulting in standing waves in this region on the other hand the wave elevations are found to reduce at the downstream of the imr wec suggesting that the wave forces have been attenuated by the presence of the floating breakwater also it is evidenced from fig 10 that the reflected wave elevation is higher when the imr wec is subjected to wave of smaller wavelength i e smaller wave period as compared to its counterpart of the longer wavelength at the same time the fb is found to be more effective in attenuating the wave force when the wavelength is shorter these two phenomena can be explained by the wave diffraction theory maccamy and fuchs 1954 where more waves are being reflected and diffracted when the incoming waves have a shorter wavelength thus resulting in greater interferences between the waves it is to be noted that the fb is less effective when the wavelength is long due to the structure moving at the same phase as the incoming waves 4 2 2 2 effect of varying spacings between wecs in this paper it is assumed that the total waterplane area for the wecs is kept almost the same i e 100 m2 for all four types of imr wec considered in table 1 it is also assumed that the spacing s p between the wec is taken to be the same as the wec width w w e c figs 11 and 12 show the effect of varying spacings between the wecs has on the wave climate surrounding the imr wec when the imr wec is subjected to regular wave with t 3 5 s and 5 0 s respectively the widths of the wec considered are w w e c 1 m 2 m 2 94 m and 5 m and are plotted in the respective sub figure a b c and d of figs 11 and 12 fig 11 shows that the imr wec is insignificantly affected by the spacing of the wecs when the incoming wave arrives from the headsea this shows that the wave disturbance surrounding the imr wec is less affected by the numbers of wec considered as long as the total waterplane area and the breakwater width are kept the same this is because the difference in the power absorption is relatively small for headsea as compared to the oblique sea see fig 7 thus the wave disturbances surrounding the imr wec with different w w e c are small also the transmitted wave at the downstream of the imr wec depends significantly on the width of the breakwater whereas the reflected wave at the upstream is affected predominantly by the motion of the wec since the w f b that affects the attenuation of wave force and the waterplane area of the wec that influences the power absorption are kept the same the difference in the wave climate does not differ much for the different cases considered in figs 11 and 12 4 2 2 3 effect of varying wec lengths the effectiveness of the imr wec depends significantly on its length dimension in the x axis direction i e the w f b and l w e c as has been investigated by various researchers dong et al 2008 elchahal et al 2008 chen et al 2012 figs 13 and 14 show the wave elevation surrounding the imr wec under regular wave with t 3 5 s and 5 0s respectively in this case the oblique wave is being investigated to assess the influence of the varying l w e c compared to the findings in the wave climate presented in the previous section there is a distinct difference in the wave disturbance surrounding the imr wec when different wec lengths are used judging from the minimum wave elevation η in fig 13 it can be deduced that the wec with longer length is capable of attenuating greater wave forces as compared to their smaller length counterparts as more wave energy is being damped by the imr wec with longer length dimension in the x direction as a result more waves are being reflected by the imr wec with larger l w e c evidenced from the higher wave elevation located upstream of the floating structure in fig 13 fig 14 however shows that the effect of wec length is insignificant towards the wave climate and this is due to the imr wec behaving ineffectively when encountering an incoming wave with longer wavelength as longer waves having higher energy shall propagate pass the floating structure with minimal diffraction and reflection 4 3 l shape floating bw under different wave directions the more practical l shape imr wec as given in fig 3 is then considered the l shape imr wec allows the wec to extract energy and the fb to attenuate the wave force more effectively from wave coming in the oblique sea the dimensions of the l shape imr wec follow the basic dimensions of the type b imr wec considered in table 1 unless otherwise defined 4 3 1 performance 4 3 1 1 regular wave the performance of the l shape imr wec in terms of the power absorption is first obtained and plotted in fig 15 four different wave directions are considered i e θ 0 30 45 and 60 fig 15 shows that in general the power absorption reduces with the increase in the wave period i e longer wavelength this is because the raft type wecs pitch in phase with the orbital motion of the wave with a longer wavelength thus producing lesser energy also by configuring the iwr wec in an l shape configuration this allows the fb that faces the head sea and the oblique sea to extract the energy more effectively it can be seen from fig 15 that an almost consistent amount of wave energy is produced for all oblique waves considered this is very important as it allows consistent energy production for varying directional waves it is to note that the power produced by the imr wec is the highest when the waves arrive from θ 30 and 45 but the efficiency of the l shape imr wec drops slightly when the wave direction increases to θ 60 this is because of the slight difference between the length of the fb in x and y axes directions i e y axis direction having a length of 98 m and x axis direction having a length of 100 m see fig 3 thus might have influenced the hydrodynamic coefficients of the system 4 3 1 2 irregular waves next the performance of the imr wec under the uni directional bretschneider bs wave spectrum is studied fig 16 shows the comparisons between the bs wave spectra and the power absorption p a for the l shape imr wec under varying regular wave frequencies ranging from 0 05 rad s to 4 0 rad s with θ 0 30 45 and 60 the plot for six different bs wave spectra with peak wave periods t p 3 0 s 3 5 s 4 0 s 5 0 s 5 5 s and 6 0s are given in fig 16 the power absorption p a from the regular wave is obtained from eq 25 fig 16 shows that the imr wec has the highest power absorption for θ 0 under high frequency waves however as the encountering peak wave frequency for the uni directional irregular wave sea state being considered for the tropical climate are smaller than 2 1 rad s i e greater than t p 3 0 s thus more energy is instead being generated in the oblique wave when a sea state with t p 3 s is considered as presented in fig 17 fig 17 shows that the average power absorption p a generated from the imr wec increases with the increase in wave direction except for the t p 3 0 s and 3 5 s where the imr wec produces the greatest energy under headsea the reason for this phenomenon is due to resonance that occurs at 1 57 s and 2 13 s see fig 18 for the l shape imr wec fig 18 shows that the power absorption p a for the imr wec plotted against the regular wave periods the p a is found to increase with the wave direction except when the imr wec is operating at sea state with wave periods close to its natural periods it is interesting to note that the l shape imr wec is excited at its two natural periods at t 3 s these range of wave periods are not considered in the regular wave analysis but have to be considered in the response spectrum analysis for irregular waves 4 3 2 wave climate 4 3 2 1 regular wave the wave disturbance around the imr wec under regular waves for t 3 5 s and t 5 0 s are compared in figs 19 and 20 respectively the wave directions considered are θ 0 30 45 and 60 figs 19 and 20 show that the floating breakwater is more effective when operating at sea state with smaller wave period i e small wavelength due to the greater amount of diffracted wave generated under smaller wave condition the results also show that the efficiency of the l shape fb in attenuating the wave forces reduces with the increase in wave angle θ this could be due to the constructive interference of the transmitted wave located downstream of the l shape fb resulting in an amplification of wave amplitudes however it is interesting to note that the maximum wave elevation due to the reflected waves reduces as compared to its counterpart of a one sided fb shown in section 4 2 this shows that the destructive interference occurs at the upstream of the l shape configuration thus producing a smaller wave amplitude amplification in the reflected waves 4 3 2 2 irregular wave the wave climate surrounding the l shape imr wec under irregular wave is next investigated figs 21 and 22 show the average wave elevation η surrounding the l shape imr wec for headsea θ 0 and oblique wave θ 30 respectively the wave period t p considered are t p 3 0 s 3 5s 4 0s 5 0s 5 5s and 6 0 s the wave elevations along the cross sections cs of the wavefield are also plotted in each figure the reduction in the wave elevation is found to be significant when t p is small evidenced from figs 21 and 22 but the effectiveness in attenuating the wave forces is found to reduce when t p increases it can be seen from the wave elevation along the cs1 y 0 fig 21 that the waves are being reflected by the fb causing interference of waves upstream of the fb and attenuation of waves downstream the fb the wave elevations are found to increase significantly at the upstream close to the fb followed by a decrease in the wave elevation downstream the fb this is also observed along cs3 in fig 22 which is taken along the direction of the incident wave propagation at θ 30 that passes the origin x 0 y 0 the wave elevation along cs1 also shows that the fb has minimal effect on the incoming waves when the wavelength is long i e t p 5 s and 6 s in fig 21 by comparing the wave elevation along cs1 and cs2 in fig 21 it can be seen that the wave elevation along cs2 is lower than its counterpart along cs1 this is because of the presence of the fb in the x axis direction close to cs2 thus contributes to dampening the wave forces likewise it can be seen from fig 22 that the wave elevation along cs2 x 90 m has an increasing wave elevation amplitude when it is further away from the fb an interesting finding is that not only the transmitted wave but also the reflected wave could be effectively reduced by the l shape imr wec through the destructive wave interference produced by the l shape configuration this is important as the reflected waves from the imr wec will cause unwanted disturbance to other offshore activities in the upstream of the imr wec figs 23 and 24 show the wave disturbances surrounding the l shape imr wec when the mooring stiffness is increased to k m o o r i n g 10 under θ 0 and 30 respectively this is to investigate the effectiveness of the fb when they are moored with a high stiffness such that the motion of the fb is minimal only t p of 3 0s 3 5s and 4 0s are considered here as the fb is more effective when the wavelength is small it can be seen that there is a significant decrease in the wave elevations downstream the imr wec in figs 23 and 24 as compared to their counterparts in figs 21 and 22 this finding shows that it is important to keep the motion of the fb small in order to minimise the contribution of wave disturbances from the fb 5 conclusion an integrated multi raft wave energy convertor was proposed to generate clean energy from wave and to protect the coast from erosion due to wave impact the energy was produced by a power take off system installed at the hinge connector that joins the wecs and the fb numerical investigations on the performance of the imr wec and wave disturbance surrounding the floating system under regular and irregular were successfully investigated the findings for the various parametric studies are summarized as follows wec width generally the power absorption from the imr wec decreases with the increase in wavelength due to the imr wec moving in phase with the orbital motion of the wave under oblique wave the imr wec generates more power with a smaller wec width due to its lower mass inertia i e larger motion mooring stiffness the imr wec was found to generate more energy when the fb is moored by lines with higher stiffness due to the greater relative motion between the wecs and the more stable fb the more stable fb with minimal motion will ensure smaller radiated waves being generated and this is important for the fb in protecting the coastal lines wec length it was found that an ideal wec length to generate greater energy falls in between 2 m and 3 m a shorter wec does not have sufficient inertia to generate energy whereas a long wec is too heavy to pitch thus resulting in smaller energy generation wave periods the imr wec was found to be more effective in attenuating the wave forces when the structure is subjected to wave of smaller wavelength i e smaller wave period due to the larger diffracted and radiated waves generated the investigation of the l shape imr wec under regular and irregular waves showed that the l shape imr wec is very effective in generating energy from wave coming from the oblique direction the study also showed that the l shape imr wec is effective when the peak wave period is small i e smaller wavelength but the difference in the energy generated at higher peak wave period value is insignificant for different wave directions the concept of integrating wave energy converter with floating breakwater is beneficial for coastal cities as it protects the coastlines from erosion and at the same time allows the conversion of wave energy into clean electricity the proposed imr wec was shown to be very effective in tropical climate via the numerical investigation presented a second order wave analysis shall be conducted in the future to investigate the performance and wave

21353,this paper investigates the position of the instantaneous center of rotation in pitch response of a moored vessel submitted to regular head waves the vessel is assumed to respond only in surge heave and pitch which allows a 2d approach in the x z plane due to symmetry the concept is formalized via an analytical approach in a previous study showing that even though this point is time dependent it will always be located along a well defined straight line in space for a moored vessel submitted to linear regular head waves this study presents an analytical formulation to describe the distribution of these points along the straight line following a cauchy probability density function the concept of the most often instantaneous rotation center in pitch is introduced as the peak of said probability density function which might arise as an interesting tool for quickly estimating the points of minimum amplitude of motion of a moored vessel submitted to head regular waves during one cycle the paper also presents numerical data obtained through commercial software based on linear potential theory as well as experimental data from tests performed in a narrow wave channel to validate the proposed approach keywords ship motion hydrodynamics model test fpso instantaneous center of rotation most often instantaneous center of rotation in pitch nomenclature l vessel length ω

amplitude β inclination of s axis with respect the longitudinal axis at the global coordinate system 1 introduction the dynamics of floating bodies is a rather complex problem and cannot be completely treated analytically as a consequence many analyses rely on numerical simulations in frequency domain to estimate the vessels motion and in case of necessity a realization in time domain based on the coefficients obtained in the frequency domain simulation followed by statistical studies in order to verify safety and operability in situations such as heavy cargo handling for instance it is intuitive to avoid placing the crane at the fore or aft ends of the vessel because even disregarding the hydrostatic issues that could be caused such positions of the crane would lead to substantially high dynamic loads due to the vessel s movement this conclusion could be drawn by considering the vessel s motion in surge heave and pitch combining these amplitudes and phases to generate a movement in space alternatively if one could represent the vessel s motion as a pure rotation around a specific point its center of rotation one could more intuitively get to this conclusion by simply observing the crane position with respect the center of rotation in other cases such as ship to ship cargo or personnel transfer the concept of instantaneous center of rotation might provide reliable information for a quick evaluation on the operability and safety of said operations similarly in early design stages of vessels with moonpools such as drillships or the assessment of dynamic loads in appendages installed at the hull such as the risers in fpso s with spreading system the instantaneous center of rotation can also be an interesting tool all examples above are fundamentally related to the dynamics of a floating vessel and focus on finding the points that present the minimum amplitude of motion in investigations for wave energy devices on the other hand it might be interesting to focus on finding points with large movement but can still be investigated using the same tools the solution for these studies commonly relies on time series realization which might require many attempts to find minimum or maximum in such cases the concept of instantaneous center of rotation might arise as an interesting tool for easily and quickly estimating the points of minimum or maximum motion of a floating body when under influence of an incident wave system from a general direction any freely floating body presents a general motion with all six degrees of freedom which is usually difficult to visualize and does not allow conclusions by itself even in situations when the analysis is simplified by considering only a single regular excitation which results in a single harmonic response in each degree of freedom the motion is still complex and might demand a more careful analysis consequently as a freely floating body the vessel s movement cannot be represented by a pure rotation in general however for small time steps each differential displacement can be interpreted as a pure rotation around one point in space the instantaneous center of rotation which will be subject to variations in time according to the vessel s movement when considering only head or following wave conditions in seakeeping analysis of a vessel assuming geometrical and inertial symmetry it is possible to simplify its motion to only the symmetric degrees of freedom surge heave and pitch in such condition the instantaneous center of rotation is here called instantaneous center rotation in pitch i r c p few concerns have been found in literature about the i r c p itself but recently fernandes et al 2015 2016 investigated the behavior of the instantaneous center of rotation in roll referred to as i r c r in the present text given a set of incident regular beam waves through model test and obtaining evidence that for regular incident waves the roll center distributes along a straight line in space with respect an inertial reference frame in the latter reference the authors show that the i r c r depends on the wave frequency and that it stays around a modal point which is not necessarily between the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy as mistakenly suggested in pna lewis 1988 in later studies fernandes et al 2018 investigate the most often instantaneous rotation center in roll referred as m o i r c r in the present text suggesting a cauchy distribution with high adherence to experimental data as well as its relations to roll damping also illustrating usefulness of i r c r as a tool in such analysis it is possible to relate the distribution of i r c p to that observed for i r c r as presented by costa et al 2018 expecting a straight line around which the points are located previous experiments suggested that the side facing the waves tends to present greater motions than the other indicating the i r c p to be closer to the opposite side the present study extends the investigations about the instantaneous rotation center in pitch i r c p by studying how it spreads along the straight line presented by costa et al 2018 introducing the concept of the most often instantaneous rotation center in pitch or m o i r c p the investigation presents an analytical approach do describe the distribution of i r c p along the straight line and also considers experimental and numerical analysis the former corresponding to scaled model tests conducted in loc laboratório de ondas e correntes laboratory of waves and current at the federal university of rio de janeiro ufrj and the later through hydrostar 2018 and wamit 2006 both potential theory based codes implemented in frequency domain 2 analytical approach 2 1 instantaneous centre of rotation in pitch the concept of instantaneous center of rotation as presented by meriam and kraige 2006 can be calculated by representing the displacement at any point in the body as a pure rotation around a virtual and still unknown point in space as in equation 1 where δ s i is the displacement vector of a generic point p attached to the vessel with respect an inertial reference frame δ θ represents the angular motion and r p i r c is the distance between the generic point p and the still unknown instantaneous center of rotation unless stated otherwise all variables refer to an inertial global reference frame 1 δ s p δ θ r p i r c starting from this idea costa et al 2018 presented the development of this analysis for a vessel assuming harmonic motions in surge heave and pitch which is the usual outcome for a first order regular head wave for a moored vessel resulting in equations 2 and 3 2 z i c r p t η 05 cos ω t α 5 η 01 cos ω t α 1 3 x i c r p t η 05 cos ω t α 5 η 03 cos ω t α 3 still in costa et al 2018 the vertical and longitudinal coordinates of i c r p are shown to present a relation as in equation 4 which represents a straight line in the x z plane that depends on the response amplitude operators in these degrees of freedom and consequently varies with the incoming wave frequency 4 η 03 η 05 sin α 3 α 5 z i c r p c η 01 η 05 sin α 1 α 5 x i c r p c η 01 η 03 sin α 1 α 3 this expression represents as mentioned previously that the locus of i c r p for any time is straight line in the x z plane and from now on it will be referred to as the s axis in this text 2 2 i c r p statistical distribution in the x z plane equation 4 shows clearly that even though each component of i c r p will vary in time their relation will be frequency dependent but time independent this is equivalent to say that the i c r p will always be located along a straight line in space for a regular wave excitation which will however vary due to the frequency dependence of the vessel s phases and amplitudes of motion however it is possible to further understand the dynamic behavior presented by the vessel by implementing a statistical investigation on how i c r p spreads along the s axis based on asgari et al 2020 the knowledge about the relation between z i r c p and x i r c p formalized in equation 4 allows the prediction on their variation in time as well assuming both the longitudinal and vertical positions of i c r p to be random variables defined as a function of time then the probability density function of each can be calculated through equations 5 and 6 as in meirovitch 2001 5 p x i r c p p t d x i r c p d t 6 p z i r c p p t d z i r c p d t for this task it might be useful to first apply a change of variables in equations 2 and 3 in order to make the expressions easier to handle let t ˆ t α 5 ω which means d t ˆ d t is time independent this change in variables is a simple shift in time and is valid since the analysis is performed for a stationary state equations 7 and 8 can be written 7 x i r c p t ˆ η 03 η 05 cos α 3 α 5 sin α 3 α 5 tan ω t ˆ 8 z i r c p t ˆ η 01 η 05 cos α 1 α 5 sin α 1 α 5 tan ω t ˆ it is sensible to assume that time is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed thus p t 2 τ for half a cycle replacing the expressions for x i r c p and z i r c p in equations 7 and 8 and rearranging one can estimate the probability density functions pdf s that represent their distribution in space 9 p x i r c p 2 τ η 03 η 05 ω sin α 3 α 5 sec 2 ω t ˆ 2 τ η 03 η 05 ω sin α 3 α 5 1 tan 2 ω t ˆ 10 p z i r c p 2 τ η 01 η 05 ω sin α 1 α 5 sec 2 ω t ˆ 2 τ η 01 η 05 ω sin α 1 α 5 1 tan 2 ω t ˆ one can simply rearrange the equations above so that the very expressions of the longitudinal and vertical of i r c p are present in their respective pdf s 11 p x i r c p η 03 η 05 sin α 3 α 5 π η 03 η 05 sin α 3 α 5 2 x i r c p η 03 η 05 cos α 3 α 5 2 12 p z i r c p η 01 η 05 sin α 1 α 5 π η 01 η 05 sin α 1 α 5 2 z i r c p η 01 η 05 cos α 1 α 5 2 equations 11 and 12 follow the general expression for the cauchy distribution presented by drake 1967 as the ratio between two independent normal distributions given its general expression and shape see fig 6 one can assume the peak of this pdf the term subtracted from the argument x i r c p in equation 11 for instance to be represent its mean but even though this curve is symmetric there is not a mean value per say for this distribution since the integral below this curve does not exist because of this the peaks obtained in the histogram will be referred to as the most often instantaneous rotation center in pitch or m o i r c p in contrast to its pair in the y z plane most often instantaneous rotation center in roll or m o i r c r and can be calculated as in equations 13 and 14 this leads to interesting numerical and experimental conclusions as shown below 13 x m o i r c p η 03 η 05 cos α 3 α 5 14 z m o i r c p η 01 η 05 cos α 1 α 5 2 3 the s and r coordinates as illustrated in fig 1 the s axis can be used to define a new coordinate system by transforming the x z system an orthogonal basis can be formed by considering a second axis perpendicular to the s axis referred to as the r axis the transform from the x coordinate into the s axis can be derived from equation 4 via a rotation of an β angle and a translation as in equation 15 15 s r cos β sin β sin β cos β x x 0 z z 0 in the equation above x 0 and z 0 are simply the coordinates of a reference point through which the transformed axis will pass according to equation 4 the s coordinate can then be written a function of both its longitudinal and vertical positions as well as the rotation angle β which means that it is possible to obtain its probability density function following the same procedure presented previously for the x z coordinates that is by assuming time to be uniformly distributed and relating both pdf s similarly to equations 11 and 12 which leads to equation 16 16

a model which presents the usual geometry for a generic fpso platform in a 1 300 scale the dimensions and inertial properties are displayed in table 1 at full scale and fig 2 illustrates the geometry investigated the dimensions and distribution of the panels for the simulation using potential theory followed the ideas presented in appendix a of this text with a maximum panel size about one tenth of the minimum wavelength to be simulated as default generic reference point c was defined at the center of gravity following the data presented in table 1 the vertical distance from keel to center of gravity and the longitudinal distance to the aft end of the vessel are both presented to identify the location of the center of gravity external restoration was added to simulate the planar effects due to the soft mooring system since the geometry represents a typical fpso platform the virtual mooring system was estimated so that the vessel s natural period in surge would be close to 2 min in full scale nearly 7 s in model scale 3 2 response amplitude operator in open seas the geometry in fig 2 was tested in both high order and low order methods in wamit 2006 as well as using hydrostar 2018 the comparison between the results obtained using the different methods in open sea conditions for head waves is illustrated in fig 3 in terms of the response amplitude operators in surge upper heave middle and pitch lower as a function of the corresponding wave period in full scale the instantaneous rotation center in pitch i r c p the time and spatial distribution of i r c p was verified via a time series realization based on the numerical data for the raos presented in fig 3 the longitudinal and vertical coordinates of i r c p were calculated through equations 2 and 3 for each instant of time and based on the raos obtained numerically from hydrostar 2018 the timestep was set as 1 thousandth of the wave period for one cycle of duration fig 4 presents the time series for both coordinates clearly resembling tangent like behavior as predicted by equations 7 and 8 consequently i r c p spreads along the s axis as predicted by equation 4 as displayed in fig 5 as stated along section 2 the coordinates of i r c p are presented with respect an inertial reference frame in the present study the local reference frame was placed at the origin of the inertial coordinate system which is the default in both wamit 2006 and hydrostar 2018 costa et al 2018 presents this type of plot only for experimental data fig 5 shows a remarkable adherence notice the r 2 1 for the linear regression between numerical data obtained from time series realization to the expected curve based on the raos alone confirming that as long as the vessel presents a well defined harmonic behavior i r c p will be located along s axis fig 5 also illustrates how i r c p spreads along the s axis equations 11 and 12 show that both vertical and horizontal components of i r c p follow a cauchy distribution fig 6 displays the histogram of x i r c p and z i r c p for the same 17 3 s wave period comparing to the expected cauchy distribution to which the numerical data presents a remarkable adherence as indicated by equation 4 the inclination of s axis is frequency dependent since it is a function of the raos and more importantly the phase difference between surge and heave with respect pitch this angle can be calculated by simply taking the arc tangent function of the ratio between linear and angular coefficients in equation 4 as presented in equation 17 this angle is plotted against the wave period to highlight this fact as presented in fig 7 17 β atan η 01 η 03 sin α 1 α 5 sin α 3 α 5 the inclination of s axis tends to zero as the wave period increases another interesting aspect in this plot is the appearance of ripples observed for smaller periods which are a consequence of the rough variations in the raos due to peaks corresponding to natural frequency the discontinuities at about 10 s and 14 s seem to be related to the changes from 180 to 180 observed for the phase response in heave and surge respectively for these periods the raos present nearly zero response in each corresponding degree of freedom see fig 3 fig 7 shows the behavior of the s axis inclination as a function of wave periods indicating that for large wave periods it tends to converge to 0 fig 8 extends this analysis by displaying the s axis for large periods illustrating that not only the inclination decreases tending to zero but also the curve moves upwards far from the vessel this image also presents the m o i r c p for each wave period calculated through the equations 13 and 14 showing they tend to be located nearly at the same longitudinal position marked with x in each curve more nuances of i r c p are discussed in more detail in appendix b of this text 3 3 instantaneous center of zero velocity many authors such as meriam and kraige 2006 refer to the instantaneous center of rotation as the instantaneous center of zero velocity this alternative nomenclature not only explicitly highlights the fact that i r c p presents minimum velocity amongst the rigid body points but also suggests that the further away from it the larger the velocity since the body s motion is described as a pure rotation this feature is illustrated in fig 9 with a color map representing the intensity of motion of a grid of points attached to the vessel the darkest blue meaning the smallest value and the brightest yellow representing the largest intensity of motion fig 9 also displays the location of m o i r c p based on the histograms in fig 6 as well as based on the equations 13 and 14 from this colormap it is possible to observe the closer to m o i r c p the lowest the motion presented by the vessel with the point of minimum motion amplitude matching to the estimations for m o i r c p based on fig 9 it is possible to see that amplitude of motion at m o i r c p is less intense than at the center of gravity marked with a red x fig 10 presents more explicitly the comparison between the motions at the center of gravity and at m o i r c p illustrating how the movement at the former is significantly more intense than at m o i r c p especially in the longitudinal direction 3 4 numerical simulation in channel the proximity of the sidewalls to the model induces significant modifications in the resulting potential field in both radiation and diffraction cases this is usually referred to as the sidewall effects over seakeeping model test the software hydrostar 2018 was used in order to simulate such effects numerically which was done through the mode in the software that computes the tank green function tgf as proposed by chen 1994 this approach allows the computation of the modified coefficients for both radiation and diffraction cases resulting in variations in the amplitude and phase raos fig 11 presents the raos for the same geometry simulated in a 300 m wide channel at a depth of 240 m which are the corresponding dimensions of the wave channel used for the experimental analysis presented later in this study in these plots it is possible to observe a few fast variations on the modified curves with respect the ones obtained for the open sea condition as the period increases the wavelength tends to be significantly larger than the model dimensions resulting in responses closer to the open sea motions another aspect common to all degrees of freedom is the peaks observed for the response inside the wave channel at about 11 and 14 s around 0 64 s and 0 80 s in model scale the former seems to be related to the model s natural period in pitch illustrated by the peak found in the corresponding rao in open sea conditions which seems to be intensified by the presence of the sidewalls and due to the couplings between these degrees of freedom specially heave and pitch as for the second peak it seems to be related to the wave channel itself considering the water depth set for the experiments 80 cm in model scale the dispersion relationship provides a wavelength of 1 m for this period 0 80 s in model scale which is exactly the channel s width therefore this period is the second transversal natural mode of the channel intensifying the model s response consequently this phenomenon was observed in other experiments performed at the same wave channel for models with completely different dimensions and geometries reinforcing this idea all these variations of the response in a channel with respect the open sea motions are transmitted to the plots of x i r c p and z i r c p the singularities induced by the presence of walls result in a nearly chaotic behavior of i r c p as illustrated in fig 12 4 experimental analysis 4 1 general procedure the experimental analysis was performed using a fiberglass model with the same geometry as that used in the numerical study as mentioned previously fig 13 illustrates the model during the tests the recommendations presented by the ittc procedures ocean engineering committee of the 28th ittc 2017a 2017b for model tests in regular waves were followed a total of 20 wave periods was chosen with values between 0 6 s and 1 4 s in model scale corresponding to approximately 10 4 s and 24 25 s in full scale all wave amplitudes were defined so that the wave steepness was below 2 within the usual limits for linear wave theory the tests were performed at the wave channel of the laboratory of waves and currents at the federal university of rio de janeiro which is 30 m long and 1 m wide and the water depth set to 80 cm the wavemaker system installed at this channel is a flap type with capability of generating regular wave of periods in the range between 0 6 s and 2 s with variation of 0 01 s accurately the experimental set up consisted of the model itself floating in the wave channel a set of soft springs representing the mooring system a capacitance wave probe placed ahead the model and an optical tracking system with high definition cameras to record the model s motion fig 14 illustrates the experimental assembly schematically the red dots represent the markers attached to the model to capture its motion with the optical tracking system and the soft springs were used to simulate the planar restoring of the mooring system and prevent the model to drift away the soft mooring system was selected to resemble that in the numerical simulations presented in the previous section therefore vessel s natural period in surge was close to 2 min in full scale nearly 7 s in model scale it was imposed that all 4 springs were the same to ensure the symmetry of assembly and minimize the transverse motions of the model the wave elevation was measured with a capacitance wave probe set to a sampling rate of 50 hz as well as the camera tracking system a trigger was connected to both systems to ensure synchronization between the data from wave elevation and model response a 4th order butterworth bandpass filter was applied over the time series acquired to remove noise and low frequency related to 2nd order effects allowing frequencies between 0 5 hz and 2 5 hz in the model scale in the signal analyzed fig 15 displays a comparison between the raw data and the filtered time series for the surge response of the model illustrating the removal of the 2nd order effects over the model s motion as well as the high frequency noises the analysis of i r c p based on experimental data is sensitive to the filter used as well as the sampling rate as discussed later in this text 4 2 response amplitude operator the experimental results obtained are displayed in fig 16 in terms of the raos in surge heave and pitch compared to the numerical curves without and with the presence of the sidewalls showing a general good agreement to the later fig 16 illustrates clearly that disregarding the sidewalls of the channel leads to strong differences between numerical and experimental curves it is possible to observe general agreement between the experimental data and numerical data once the sidewalls are considered in the simulations however a few points acquired experimentally deviate from the numerical curve we can observe that in the first peak predicted by numerical data red dashed curve the experimental points are significantly lower indicating larger damping over the model s response than the calculations from potential theory this deviation was somehow expected as it was reported in many other studies such as chen 1994 the second peak predicted by hydrostar 2018 is close to 0 80 s in model scale which given the 80 cm water depth of the channel corresponds to a wavelength of 1 m precisely the channel width in periods close to that a beating phenomenon for the model s motions as well as for the waves within the channel are observed which is also pointed because of sidewall effects the disturbance induced by the time series are significant as reported in costa et al 2018 and might explain the deviations found in this range of periods 4 3 instantaneous rotation center in pitch the i r c p was computed for each sample acquired and their distribution in space is displayed in fig 17 which is a similar plot to that in fig 5 the comparison between the curves presented in figs 5 and 17 shows very similar behavior between the s axis estimated numerically and experimentally this figure shows that even though the points spread a little they tend to locate around the s axis as indicated by the r square for the regressed curve validating the concept of the s axis this result is similar to that presented by fernandes et al 2015 for i r c r and by costa et al 2018 for the i r c p itself the histograms corresponding to the x i r c p and z i r c p from the previous image are displayed at the left and right side of fig 18 respectively the histograms obtained experimentally resembles that created from numerical realization fig 6 fig 18 also presents the comparison between the histograms obtained from experimental data and the expected curve based on the rao s and equations 11 and 12 the agreement observed for the experimental i r c p data to the s axis illustrated in fig 17 reflects on the histograms for each coordinate as both present the general behavior expected based on the cauchy distribution however it is noticeable that the scattering of points although not large impacted on the histograms since the curves do not match perfectly to the distribution as the numerical data in fig 6 5 results discussion the only hypothesis necessary to perform the analytical development for i r c p is the assumption of synchronized harmonic motion in surge heave and pitch as presented in section 2 1 or in more details by costa et al 2018 this is the usual outcome for numerical simulations in frequency domain potential theory such as hydrostar 2018 which was used in this study to obtain the steady state response of a moored vessel submitted to regular head waves consequently the agreement between the numerical results and the analytical curve is remarkable in both the adherence of the points to the s axis and the comparison between the histograms and the cauchy distributions obviously during the experimental model tests it is not possible to control the environment in the same level as in the numerical simulations but besides all the uncertainties faced during the model tests which certainly affected the model s movements and contributed to the scattering of i r c p the sampling rate and the filter used seem to play important roles in the discrepancies observed the time series realization used to calculate the i r c p displayed in fig 5 as well as the histograms in fig 6 was performed for 1 period at a timestep of 1 thousandth of that period in model scale the case presented corresponds to a 1 s simulation at a timestep of 1 ms which is equivalent to a 1 khz sampling rate as mentioned in section 4 1 the experimental data was acquired at a sampling rate of 50 hz which is large enough to characterize the model s response as illustrated in fig 15 however in fig 19 it is clear the difference between the numerical and experimental time series for i r c p as a consequence of the sampling rate in each the bandpass filter used also influenced the series the lower cutoff frequency was clearly important in removing the slow motions of the vessel specially in surge as illustrated in fig 15 while the higher cutoff frequency was necessary to remove the noise in the signals but in doing so it was observed that tangent shape of i r c p time series was affected as clearly illustrated in fig 19 during the analysis it was observed that the higher the cutoff frequency the more the time series were affected in the surroundings of the discontinuity related to the singularity of the tangent function therefore a careful analysis is necessary to study the tradeoff between reducing the noise level on the acquired signal and characterizing the time series for i r c p 6 conclusions this study contributes to a better understanding of the concept of i r c p and its relation to the vessel dynamic properties many similarities can be found between the i r c p and i r c r as presented by asgari et al 2020 fernandes et al 2015 2016 2018 especially regarding the existence of straight line along which the instantaneous center of rotation tends to spread and its dependence on frequency the analytical approach proves that as long as the vessel presents synchronized harmonic motions in surge heave and pitch the i r c p will be located along a straight line in space and more than that will scatter along it following a cauchy distribution this is valid for arbitrary geometries submitted to regular head waves because symmetry holds the procedures and expressions presented for head waves are all valid for following waves as well provided one uses the appropriate the transfer functions of amplitude and phase responses of the vessel the numerical analysis via time series realization illustrates the validity of this idea with remarkable adherence to the analytical estimations while experimental data presented general good agreement to the numerical results once the sidewall effects were computed through the tank green function tgf provided by hydrostar 2018 the effects on the raos observed due to the proximity of the channel walls could be seen in the i r c p as well scattering of experimental data was observed as consequence of the uncertainties of experimental environments as well as sampling frequency and filter usage to remove noise from the acquired signal which conflicts to resolution of the calculated i r c p the findings of this study show that through simple analytical expressions and numerical data from frequency domain simulation it is possible to quickly and reliably estimating the point of minimum motion of a vessel submitted to regular head waves in one wave period providing a tool to studies related to dynamic of floating bodies an extension of this analysis to represent more realistic environmental conditions such as oblique waves and random incoming waves might be considered to enrich this concept credit authorship contribution statement daniel de oliveira costa writing

over the outputs in the numerical simulations were investigated for a general rectangular barge illustrated in fig 20 with 100 m in length 20 m of beam and 7 m of draft fig 20 rectangular barge simulated to check mesh convergence fig 20 the first simulations were performed in full scale and the range of periods was set between 4 and 30 s at infinity water depth leading to wavelengths larger than 25 m the geometry was created with different panel sizes varying between 1 m and 5 m which roughly corresponds to values between one twenty fifth and one fifth of the smallest wavelength to be tested the analysis computed the volume calculated for the barge as well as the added mass in heave for the smallest wavelength to be used as the parameters for comparison and fig 21 displays these plots the left side shows that nearly no variation was found in the calculation of the submerged volume but as the mesh gets finer the computation time tends to increase substantially the right side on the other hand shows that as the panel size is reduced the added mass in heave tends to converge to a certain value with a percentage difference smaller than 1 for a relative panel size of one twelfth of the smallest wavelength fig 21 panel size in influence over volume left and added mass in heave right in wamit s high order method for the rectangular barge fig 21 to check if this ratio is applicable to more complex geometries a rounded barge was simulated as well as shown in fig 22 with the results for convergence in volume and added mass in heave displayed in fig 23 fig 22 round barge simulated to check mesh convergence fig 22 fig 23 panel size in influence over volume left and added mass in heave right in wamit s high order method for the round barge fig 23 the results show that a relative panel size of about one tenth of the smallest wavelength already lies within a range smaller than 0 5 in terms of percentage difference with respect the finest mesh tested indicating this value to be adequate to capture the convergence even for more complex geometries appendix b additional properties of ir c p and moir c p the behavior of the s axis at low period ranges is highlighted in fig 24 for the different ranges of periods in most cases the behavior of s axis is nearly chaotic with rough variations in their inclination and proximity to the vessel as well as the m o i r c p positions marked as x in the plots fig 24 s axis behavior for critical wave periods fig 24 for instance for periods close to 9 35 s the inclination varies very rapidly in direction as well this period is close to a peak observed in the rao in heave response see fig 16 at about 10 s close to a cancellation in heave even though the angle changes abruptly the different s axes crosses the vessel nearly at the same point with their m o i r c p nearly at the same position for a 11 09 s wave pitch natural period which corresponds to a period of 0 64 s in model scale the s axis inclination is nearly constant and the same is seen for the axis position as well finally at a period close to 14 s it is possible to see the effects of a rough variation in the inclination of the s axis but now crossing the model roughly at the same position in this case the cause seems to be a cancellation at surge response which leads to the discontinuity found at its phase response and seems to have been transmitted to the s axis as well fig 25 displays the distribution of x i r c p left side and z i r c p right side for the same critical periods highlighting how intense is the variation in terms of m o i r c p as well it is noticeable that i r c p spreads more widely in the periods corresponding to the natural periods 9 35 s for heave and 11 09 s for pitch while in the cases of cancellation it concentrates close to the vessel s center of gravity fig 25 i r c p distribution for critical wave periods x i r c p at the left side and z i r c p at the right side fig 25 these results suggest that at periods close to the vessel s natural period in heave the s axis tends to vary intensely in its inclination distance from vessel and in m o i r c p with small variations of the wave period as for the pitch natural response it seems the s axis varieties little with the wave frequency for periods that present a cancellation either in surge or heave the s axis inclination seems to change abruptly with small variations in the wave period but always crossing the vessel nearly at the same position where the m o i r c p tends to be located 
21353,this paper investigates the position of the instantaneous center of rotation in pitch response of a moored vessel submitted to regular head waves the vessel is assumed to respond only in surge heave and pitch which allows a 2d approach in the x z plane due to symmetry the concept is formalized via an analytical approach in a previous study showing that even though this point is time dependent it will always be located along a well defined straight line in space for a moored vessel submitted to linear regular head waves this study presents an analytical formulation to describe the distribution of these points along the straight line following a cauchy probability density function the concept of the most often instantaneous rotation center in pitch is introduced as the peak of said probability density function which might arise as an interesting tool for quickly estimating the points of minimum amplitude of motion of a moored vessel submitted to head regular waves during one cycle the paper also presents numerical data obtained through commercial software based on linear potential theory as well as experimental data from tests performed in a narrow wave channel to validate the proposed approach keywords ship motion hydrodynamics model test fpso instantaneous center of rotation most often instantaneous center of rotation in pitch nomenclature l vessel length ω

amplitude β inclination of s axis with respect the longitudinal axis at the global coordinate system 1 introduction the dynamics of floating bodies is a rather complex problem and cannot be completely treated analytically as a consequence many analyses rely on numerical simulations in frequency domain to estimate the vessels motion and in case of necessity a realization in time domain based on the coefficients obtained in the frequency domain simulation followed by statistical studies in order to verify safety and operability in situations such as heavy cargo handling for instance it is intuitive to avoid placing the crane at the fore or aft ends of the vessel because even disregarding the hydrostatic issues that could be caused such positions of the crane would lead to substantially high dynamic loads due to the vessel s movement this conclusion could be drawn by considering the vessel s motion in surge heave and pitch combining these amplitudes and phases to generate a movement in space alternatively if one could represent the vessel s motion as a pure rotation around a specific point its center of rotation one could more intuitively get to this conclusion by simply observing the crane position with respect the center of rotation in other cases such as ship to ship cargo or personnel transfer the concept of instantaneous center of rotation might provide reliable information for a quick evaluation on the operability and safety of said operations similarly in early design stages of vessels with moonpools such as drillships or the assessment of dynamic loads in appendages installed at the hull such as the risers in fpso s with spreading system the instantaneous center of rotation can also be an interesting tool all examples above are fundamentally related to the dynamics of a floating vessel and focus on finding the points that present the minimum amplitude of motion in investigations for wave energy devices on the other hand it might be interesting to focus on finding points with large movement but can still be investigated using the same tools the solution for these studies commonly relies on time series realization which might require many attempts to find minimum or maximum in such cases the concept of instantaneous center of rotation might arise as an interesting tool for easily and quickly estimating the points of minimum or maximum motion of a floating body when under influence of an incident wave system from a general direction any freely floating body presents a general motion with all six degrees of freedom which is usually difficult to visualize and does not allow conclusions by itself even in situations when the analysis is simplified by considering only a single regular excitation which results in a single harmonic response in each degree of freedom the motion is still complex and might demand a more careful analysis consequently as a freely floating body the vessel s movement cannot be represented by a pure rotation in general however for small time steps each differential displacement can be interpreted as a pure rotation around one point in space the instantaneous center of rotation which will be subject to variations in time according to the vessel s movement when considering only head or following wave conditions in seakeeping analysis of a vessel assuming geometrical and inertial symmetry it is possible to simplify its motion to only the symmetric degrees of freedom surge heave and pitch in such condition the instantaneous center of rotation is here called instantaneous center rotation in pitch i r c p few concerns have been found in literature about the i r c p itself but recently fernandes et al 2015 2016 investigated the behavior of the instantaneous center of rotation in roll referred to as i r c r in the present text given a set of incident regular beam waves through model test and obtaining evidence that for regular incident waves the roll center distributes along a straight line in space with respect an inertial reference frame in the latter reference the authors show that the i r c r depends on the wave frequency and that it stays around a modal point which is not necessarily between the center of gravity and the center of buoyancy as mistakenly suggested in pna lewis 1988 in later studies fernandes et al 2018 investigate the most often instantaneous rotation center in roll referred as m o i r c r in the present text suggesting a cauchy distribution with high adherence to experimental data as well as its relations to roll damping also illustrating usefulness of i r c r as a tool in such analysis it is possible to relate the distribution of i r c p to that observed for i r c r as presented by costa et al 2018 expecting a straight line around which the points are located previous experiments suggested that the side facing the waves tends to present greater motions than the other indicating the i r c p to be closer to the opposite side the present study extends the investigations about the instantaneous rotation center in pitch i r c p by studying how it spreads along the straight line presented by costa et al 2018 introducing the concept of the most often instantaneous rotation center in pitch or m o i r c p the investigation presents an analytical approach do describe the distribution of i r c p along the straight line and also considers experimental and numerical analysis the former corresponding to scaled model tests conducted in loc laboratório de ondas e correntes laboratory of waves and current at the federal university of rio de janeiro ufrj and the later through hydrostar 2018 and wamit 2006 both potential theory based codes implemented in frequency domain 2 analytical approach 2 1 instantaneous centre of rotation in pitch the concept of instantaneous center of rotation as presented by meriam and kraige 2006 can be calculated by representing the displacement at any point in the body as a pure rotation around a virtual and still unknown point in space as in equation 1 where δ s i is the displacement vector of a generic point p attached to the vessel with respect an inertial reference frame δ θ represents the angular motion and r p i r c is the distance between the generic point p and the still unknown instantaneous center of rotation unless stated otherwise all variables refer to an inertial global reference frame 1 δ s p δ θ r p i r c starting from this idea costa et al 2018 presented the development of this analysis for a vessel assuming harmonic motions in surge heave and pitch which is the usual outcome for a first order regular head wave for a moored vessel resulting in equations 2 and 3 2 z i c r p t η 05 cos ω t α 5 η 01 cos ω t α 1 3 x i c r p t η 05 cos ω t α 5 η 03 cos ω t α 3 still in costa et al 2018 the vertical and longitudinal coordinates of i c r p are shown to present a relation as in equation 4 which represents a straight line in the x z plane that depends on the response amplitude operators in these degrees of freedom and consequently varies with the incoming wave frequency 4 η 03 η 05 sin α 3 α 5 z i c r p c η 01 η 05 sin α 1 α 5 x i c r p c η 01 η 03 sin α 1 α 3 this expression represents as mentioned previously that the locus of i c r p for any time is straight line in the x z plane and from now on it will be referred to as the s axis in this text 2 2 i c r p statistical distribution in the x z plane equation 4 shows clearly that even though each component of i c r p will vary in time their relation will be frequency dependent but time independent this is equivalent to say that the i c r p will always be located along a straight line in space for a regular wave excitation which will however vary due to the frequency dependence of the vessel s phases and amplitudes of motion however it is possible to further understand the dynamic behavior presented by the vessel by implementing a statistical investigation on how i c r p spreads along the s axis based on asgari et al 2020 the knowledge about the relation between z i r c p and x i r c p formalized in equation 4 allows the prediction on their variation in time as well assuming both the longitudinal and vertical positions of i c r p to be random variables defined as a function of time then the probability density function of each can be calculated through equations 5 and 6 as in meirovitch 2001 5 p x i r c p p t d x i r c p d t 6 p z i r c p p t d z i r c p d t for this task it might be useful to first apply a change of variables in equations 2 and 3 in order to make the expressions easier to handle let t ˆ t α 5 ω which means d t ˆ d t is time independent this change in variables is a simple shift in time and is valid since the analysis is performed for a stationary state equations 7 and 8 can be written 7 x i r c p t ˆ η 03 η 05 cos α 3 α 5 sin α 3 α 5 tan ω t ˆ 8 z i r c p t ˆ η 01 η 05 cos α 1 α 5 sin α 1 α 5 tan ω t ˆ it is sensible to assume that time is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed thus p t 2 τ for half a cycle replacing the expressions for x i r c p and z i r c p in equations 7 and 8 and rearranging one can estimate the probability density functions pdf s that represent their distribution in space 9 p x i r c p 2 τ η 03 η 05 ω sin α 3 α 5 sec 2 ω t ˆ 2 τ η 03 η 05 ω sin α 3 α 5 1 tan 2 ω t ˆ 10 p z i r c p 2 τ η 01 η 05 ω sin α 1 α 5 sec 2 ω t ˆ 2 τ η 01 η 05 ω sin α 1 α 5 1 tan 2 ω t ˆ one can simply rearrange the equations above so that the very expressions of the longitudinal and vertical of i r c p are present in their respective pdf s 11 p x i r c p η 03 η 05 sin α 3 α 5 π η 03 η 05 sin α 3 α 5 2 x i r c p η 03 η 05 cos α 3 α 5 2 12 p z i r c p η 01 η 05 sin α 1 α 5 π η 01 η 05 sin α 1 α 5 2 z i r c p η 01 η 05 cos α 1 α 5 2 equations 11 and 12 follow the general expression for the cauchy distribution presented by drake 1967 as the ratio between two independent normal distributions given its general expression and shape see fig 6 one can assume the peak of this pdf the term subtracted from the argument x i r c p in equation 11 for instance to be represent its mean but even though this curve is symmetric there is not a mean value per say for this distribution since the integral below this curve does not exist because of this the peaks obtained in the histogram will be referred to as the most often instantaneous rotation center in pitch or m o i r c p in contrast to its pair in the y z plane most often instantaneous rotation center in roll or m o i r c r and can be calculated as in equations 13 and 14 this leads to interesting numerical and experimental conclusions as shown below 13 x m o i r c p η 03 η 05 cos α 3 α 5 14 z m o i r c p η 01 η 05 cos α 1 α 5 2 3 the s and r coordinates as illustrated in fig 1 the s axis can be used to define a new coordinate system by transforming the x z system an orthogonal basis can be formed by considering a second axis perpendicular to the s axis referred to as the r axis the transform from the x coordinate into the s axis can be derived from equation 4 via a rotation of an β angle and a translation as in equation 15 15 s r cos β sin β sin β cos β x x 0 z z 0 in the equation above x 0 and z 0 are simply the coordinates of a reference point through which the transformed axis will pass according to equation 4 the s coordinate can then be written a function of both its longitudinal and vertical positions as well as the rotation angle β which means that it is possible to obtain its probability density function following the same procedure presented previously for the x z coordinates that is by assuming time to be uniformly distributed and relating both pdf s similarly to equations 11 and 12 which leads to equation 16 16

a model which presents the usual geometry for a generic fpso platform in a 1 300 scale the dimensions and inertial properties are displayed in table 1 at full scale and fig 2 illustrates the geometry investigated the dimensions and distribution of the panels for the simulation using potential theory followed the ideas presented in appendix a of this text with a maximum panel size about one tenth of the minimum wavelength to be simulated as default generic reference point c was defined at the center of gravity following the data presented in table 1 the vertical distance from keel to center of gravity and the longitudinal distance to the aft end of the vessel are both presented to identify the location of the center of gravity external restoration was added to simulate the planar effects due to the soft mooring system since the geometry represents a typical fpso platform the virtual mooring system was estimated so that the vessel s natural period in surge would be close to 2 min in full scale nearly 7 s in model scale 3 2 response amplitude operator in open seas the geometry in fig 2 was tested in both high order and low order methods in wamit 2006 as well as using hydrostar 2018 the comparison between the results obtained using the different methods in open sea conditions for head waves is illustrated in fig 3 in terms of the response amplitude operators in surge upper heave middle and pitch lower as a function of the corresponding wave period in full scale the instantaneous rotation center in pitch i r c p the time and spatial distribution of i r c p was verified via a time series realization based on the numerical data for the raos presented in fig 3 the longitudinal and vertical coordinates of i r c p were calculated through equations 2 and 3 for each instant of time and based on the raos obtained numerically from hydrostar 2018 the timestep was set as 1 thousandth of the wave period for one cycle of duration fig 4 presents the time series for both coordinates clearly resembling tangent like behavior as predicted by equations 7 and 8 consequently i r c p spreads along the s axis as predicted by equation 4 as displayed in fig 5 as stated along section 2 the coordinates of i r c p are presented with respect an inertial reference frame in the present study the local reference frame was placed at the origin of the inertial coordinate system which is the default in both wamit 2006 and hydrostar 2018 costa et al 2018 presents this type of plot only for experimental data fig 5 shows a remarkable adherence notice the r 2 1 for the linear regression between numerical data obtained from time series realization to the expected curve based on the raos alone confirming that as long as the vessel presents a well defined harmonic behavior i r c p will be located along s axis fig 5 also illustrates how i r c p spreads along the s axis equations 11 and 12 show that both vertical and horizontal components of i r c p follow a cauchy distribution fig 6 displays the histogram of x i r c p and z i r c p for the same 17 3 s wave period comparing to the expected cauchy distribution to which the numerical data presents a remarkable adherence as indicated by equation 4 the inclination of s axis is frequency dependent since it is a function of the raos and more importantly the phase difference between surge and heave with respect pitch this angle can be calculated by simply taking the arc tangent function of the ratio between linear and angular coefficients in equation 4 as presented in equation 17 this angle is plotted against the wave period to highlight this fact as presented in fig 7 17 β atan η 01 η 03 sin α 1 α 5 sin α 3 α 5 the inclination of s axis tends to zero as the wave period increases another interesting aspect in this plot is the appearance of ripples observed for smaller periods which are a consequence of the rough variations in the raos due to peaks corresponding to natural frequency the discontinuities at about 10 s and 14 s seem to be related to the changes from 180 to 180 observed for the phase response in heave and surge respectively for these periods the raos present nearly zero response in each corresponding degree of freedom see fig 3 fig 7 shows the behavior of the s axis inclination as a function of wave periods indicating that for large wave periods it tends to converge to 0 fig 8 extends this analysis by displaying the s axis for large periods illustrating that not only the inclination decreases tending to zero but also the curve moves upwards far from the vessel this image also presents the m o i r c p for each wave period calculated through the equations 13 and 14 showing they tend to be located nearly at the same longitudinal position marked with x in each curve more nuances of i r c p are discussed in more detail in appendix b of this text 3 3 instantaneous center of zero velocity many authors such as meriam and kraige 2006 refer to the instantaneous center of rotation as the instantaneous center of zero velocity this alternative nomenclature not only explicitly highlights the fact that i r c p presents minimum velocity amongst the rigid body points but also suggests that the further away from it the larger the velocity since the body s motion is described as a pure rotation this feature is illustrated in fig 9 with a color map representing the intensity of motion of a grid of points attached to the vessel the darkest blue meaning the smallest value and the brightest yellow representing the largest intensity of motion fig 9 also displays the location of m o i r c p based on the histograms in fig 6 as well as based on the equations 13 and 14 from this colormap it is possible to observe the closer to m o i r c p the lowest the motion presented by the vessel with the point of minimum motion amplitude matching to the estimations for m o i r c p based on fig 9 it is possible to see that amplitude of motion at m o i r c p is less intense than at the center of gravity marked with a red x fig 10 presents more explicitly the comparison between the motions at the center of gravity and at m o i r c p illustrating how the movement at the former is significantly more intense than at m o i r c p especially in the longitudinal direction 3 4 numerical simulation in channel the proximity of the sidewalls to the model induces significant modifications in the resulting potential field in both radiation and diffraction cases this is usually referred to as the sidewall effects over seakeeping model test the software hydrostar 2018 was used in order to simulate such effects numerically which was done through the mode in the software that computes the tank green function tgf as proposed by chen 1994 this approach allows the computation of the modified coefficients for both radiation and diffraction cases resulting in variations in the amplitude and phase raos fig 11 presents the raos for the same geometry simulated in a 300 m wide channel at a depth of 240 m which are the corresponding dimensions of the wave channel used for the experimental analysis presented later in this study in these plots it is possible to observe a few fast variations on the modified curves with respect the ones obtained for the open sea condition as the period increases the wavelength tends to be significantly larger than the model dimensions resulting in responses closer to the open sea motions another aspect common to all degrees of freedom is the peaks observed for the response inside the wave channel at about 11 and 14 s around 0 64 s and 0 80 s in model scale the former seems to be related to the model s natural period in pitch illustrated by the peak found in the corresponding rao in open sea conditions which seems to be intensified by the presence of the sidewalls and due to the couplings between these degrees of freedom specially heave and pitch as for the second peak it seems to be related to the wave channel itself considering the water depth set for the experiments 80 cm in model scale the dispersion relationship provides a wavelength of 1 m for this period 0 80 s in model scale which is exactly the channel s width therefore this period is the second transversal natural mode of the channel intensifying the model s response consequently this phenomenon was observed in other experiments performed at the same wave channel for models with completely different dimensions and geometries reinforcing this idea all these variations of the response in a channel with respect the open sea motions are transmitted to the plots of x i r c p and z i r c p the singularities induced by the presence of walls result in a nearly chaotic behavior of i r c p as illustrated in fig 12 4 experimental analysis 4 1 general procedure the experimental analysis was performed using a fiberglass model with the same geometry as that used in the numerical study as mentioned previously fig 13 illustrates the model during the tests the recommendations presented by the ittc procedures ocean engineering committee of the 28th ittc 2017a 2017b for model tests in regular waves were followed a total of 20 wave periods was chosen with values between 0 6 s and 1 4 s in model scale corresponding to approximately 10 4 s and 24 25 s in full scale all wave amplitudes were defined so that the wave steepness was below 2 within the usual limits for linear wave theory the tests were performed at the wave channel of the laboratory of waves and currents at the federal university of rio de janeiro which is 30 m long and 1 m wide and the water depth set to 80 cm the wavemaker system installed at this channel is a flap type with capability of generating regular wave of periods in the range between 0 6 s and 2 s with variation of 0 01 s accurately the experimental set up consisted of the model itself floating in the wave channel a set of soft springs representing the mooring system a capacitance wave probe placed ahead the model and an optical tracking system with high definition cameras to record the model s motion fig 14 illustrates the experimental assembly schematically the red dots represent the markers attached to the model to capture its motion with the optical tracking system and the soft springs were used to simulate the planar restoring of the mooring system and prevent the model to drift away the soft mooring system was selected to resemble that in the numerical simulations presented in the previous section therefore vessel s natural period in surge was close to 2 min in full scale nearly 7 s in model scale it was imposed that all 4 springs were the same to ensure the symmetry of assembly and minimize the transverse motions of the model the wave elevation was measured with a capacitance wave probe set to a sampling rate of 50 hz as well as the camera tracking system a trigger was connected to both systems to ensure synchronization between the data from wave elevation and model response a 4th order butterworth bandpass filter was applied over the time series acquired to remove noise and low frequency related to 2nd order effects allowing frequencies between 0 5 hz and 2 5 hz in the model scale in the signal analyzed fig 15 displays a comparison between the raw data and the filtered time series for the surge response of the model illustrating the removal of the 2nd order effects over the model s motion as well as the high frequency noises the analysis of i r c p based on experimental data is sensitive to the filter used as well as the sampling rate as discussed later in this text 4 2 response amplitude operator the experimental results obtained are displayed in fig 16 in terms of the raos in surge heave and pitch compared to the numerical curves without and with the presence of the sidewalls showing a general good agreement to the later fig 16 illustrates clearly that disregarding the sidewalls of the channel leads to strong differences between numerical and experimental curves it is possible to observe general agreement between the experimental data and numerical data once the sidewalls are considered in the simulations however a few points acquired experimentally deviate from the numerical curve we can observe that in the first peak predicted by numerical data red dashed curve the experimental points are significantly lower indicating larger damping over the model s response than the calculations from potential theory this deviation was somehow expected as it was reported in many other studies such as chen 1994 the second peak predicted by hydrostar 2018 is close to 0 80 s in model scale which given the 80 cm water depth of the channel corresponds to a wavelength of 1 m precisely the channel width in periods close to that a beating phenomenon for the model s motions as well as for the waves within the channel are observed which is also pointed because of sidewall effects the disturbance induced by the time series are significant as reported in costa et al 2018 and might explain the deviations found in this range of periods 4 3 instantaneous rotation center in pitch the i r c p was computed for each sample acquired and their distribution in space is displayed in fig 17 which is a similar plot to that in fig 5 the comparison between the curves presented in figs 5 and 17 shows very similar behavior between the s axis estimated numerically and experimentally this figure shows that even though the points spread a little they tend to locate around the s axis as indicated by the r square for the regressed curve validating the concept of the s axis this result is similar to that presented by fernandes et al 2015 for i r c r and by costa et al 2018 for the i r c p itself the histograms corresponding to the x i r c p and z i r c p from the previous image are displayed at the left and right side of fig 18 respectively the histograms obtained experimentally resembles that created from numerical realization fig 6 fig 18 also presents the comparison between the histograms obtained from experimental data and the expected curve based on the rao s and equations 11 and 12 the agreement observed for the experimental i r c p data to the s axis illustrated in fig 17 reflects on the histograms for each coordinate as both present the general behavior expected based on the cauchy distribution however it is noticeable that the scattering of points although not large impacted on the histograms since the curves do not match perfectly to the distribution as the numerical data in fig 6 5 results discussion the only hypothesis necessary to perform the analytical development for i r c p is the assumption of synchronized harmonic motion in surge heave and pitch as presented in section 2 1 or in more details by costa et al 2018 this is the usual outcome for numerical simulations in frequency domain potential theory such as hydrostar 2018 which was used in this study to obtain the steady state response of a moored vessel submitted to regular head waves consequently the agreement between the numerical results and the analytical curve is remarkable in both the adherence of the points to the s axis and the comparison between the histograms and the cauchy distributions obviously during the experimental model tests it is not possible to control the environment in the same level as in the numerical simulations but besides all the uncertainties faced during the model tests which certainly affected the model s movements and contributed to the scattering of i r c p the sampling rate and the filter used seem to play important roles in the discrepancies observed the time series realization used to calculate the i r c p displayed in fig 5 as well as the histograms in fig 6 was performed for 1 period at a timestep of 1 thousandth of that period in model scale the case presented corresponds to a 1 s simulation at a timestep of 1 ms which is equivalent to a 1 khz sampling rate as mentioned in section 4 1 the experimental data was acquired at a sampling rate of 50 hz which is large enough to characterize the model s response as illustrated in fig 15 however in fig 19 it is clear the difference between the numerical and experimental time series for i r c p as a consequence of the sampling rate in each the bandpass filter used also influenced the series the lower cutoff frequency was clearly important in removing the slow motions of the vessel specially in surge as illustrated in fig 15 while the higher cutoff frequency was necessary to remove the noise in the signals but in doing so it was observed that tangent shape of i r c p time series was affected as clearly illustrated in fig 19 during the analysis it was observed that the higher the cutoff frequency the more the time series were affected in the surroundings of the discontinuity related to the singularity of the tangent function therefore a careful analysis is necessary to study the tradeoff between reducing the noise level on the acquired signal and characterizing the time series for i r c p 6 conclusions this study contributes to a better understanding of the concept of i r c p and its relation to the vessel dynamic properties many similarities can be found between the i r c p and i r c r as presented by asgari et al 2020 fernandes et al 2015 2016 2018 especially regarding the existence of straight line along which the instantaneous center of rotation tends to spread and its dependence on frequency the analytical approach proves that as long as the vessel presents synchronized harmonic motions in surge heave and pitch the i r c p will be located along a straight line in space and more than that will scatter along it following a cauchy distribution this is valid for arbitrary geometries submitted to regular head waves because symmetry holds the procedures and expressions presented for head waves are all valid for following waves as well provided one uses the appropriate the transfer functions of amplitude and phase responses of the vessel the numerical analysis via time series realization illustrates the validity of this idea with remarkable adherence to the analytical estimations while experimental data presented general good agreement to the numerical results once the sidewall effects were computed through the tank green function tgf provided by hydrostar 2018 the effects on the raos observed due to the proximity of the channel walls could be seen in the i r c p as well scattering of experimental data was observed as consequence of the uncertainties of experimental environments as well as sampling frequency and filter usage to remove noise from the acquired signal which conflicts to resolution of the calculated i r c p the findings of this study show that through simple analytical expressions and numerical data from frequency domain simulation it is possible to quickly and reliably estimating the point of minimum motion of a vessel submitted to regular head waves in one wave period providing a tool to studies related to dynamic of floating bodies an extension of this analysis to represent more realistic environmental conditions such as oblique waves and random incoming waves might be considered to enrich this concept credit authorship contribution statement daniel de oliveira costa writing

over the outputs in the numerical simulations were investigated for a general rectangular barge illustrated in fig 20 with 100 m in length 20 m of beam and 7 m of draft fig 20 rectangular barge simulated to check mesh convergence fig 20 the first simulations were performed in full scale and the range of periods was set between 4 and 30 s at infinity water depth leading to wavelengths larger than 25 m the geometry was created with different panel sizes varying between 1 m and 5 m which roughly corresponds to values between one twenty fifth and one fifth of the smallest wavelength to be tested the analysis computed the volume calculated for the barge as well as the added mass in heave for the smallest wavelength to be used as the parameters for comparison and fig 21 displays these plots the left side shows that nearly no variation was found in the calculation of the submerged volume but as the mesh gets finer the computation time tends to increase substantially the right side on the other hand shows that as the panel size is reduced the added mass in heave tends to converge to a certain value with a percentage difference smaller than 1 for a relative panel size of one twelfth of the smallest wavelength fig 21 panel size in influence over volume left and added mass in heave right in wamit s high order method for the rectangular barge fig 21 to check if this ratio is applicable to more complex geometries a rounded barge was simulated as well as shown in fig 22 with the results for convergence in volume and added mass in heave displayed in fig 23 fig 22 round barge simulated to check mesh convergence fig 22 fig 23 panel size in influence over volume left and added mass in heave right in wamit s high order method for the round barge fig 23 the results show that a relative panel size of about one tenth of the smallest wavelength already lies within a range smaller than 0 5 in terms of percentage difference with respect the finest mesh tested indicating this value to be adequate to capture the convergence even for more complex geometries appendix b additional properties of ir c p and moir c p the behavior of the s axis at low period ranges is highlighted in fig 24 for the different ranges of periods in most cases the behavior of s axis is nearly chaotic with rough variations in their inclination and proximity to the vessel as well as the m o i r c p positions marked as x in the plots fig 24 s axis behavior for critical wave periods fig 24 for instance for periods close to 9 35 s the inclination varies very rapidly in direction as well this period is close to a peak observed in the rao in heave response see fig 16 at about 10 s close to a cancellation in heave even though the angle changes abruptly the different s axes crosses the vessel nearly at the same point with their m o i r c p nearly at the same position for a 11 09 s wave pitch natural period which corresponds to a period of 0 64 s in model scale the s axis inclination is nearly constant and the same is seen for the axis position as well finally at a period close to 14 s it is possible to see the effects of a rough variation in the inclination of the s axis but now crossing the model roughly at the same position in this case the cause seems to be a cancellation at surge response which leads to the discontinuity found at its phase response and seems to have been transmitted to the s axis as well fig 25 displays the distribution of x i r c p left side and z i r c p right side for the same critical periods highlighting how intense is the variation in terms of m o i r c p as well it is noticeable that i r c p spreads more widely in the periods corresponding to the natural periods 9 35 s for heave and 11 09 s for pitch while in the cases of cancellation it concentrates close to the vessel s center of gravity fig 25 i r c p distribution for critical wave periods x i r c p at the left side and z i r c p at the right side fig 25 these results suggest that at periods close to the vessel s natural period in heave the s axis tends to vary intensely in its inclination distance from vessel and in m o i r c p with small variations of the wave period as for the pitch natural response it seems the s axis varieties little with the wave frequency for periods that present a cancellation either in surge or heave the s axis inclination seems to change abruptly with small variations in the wave period but always crossing the vessel nearly at the same position where the m o i r c p tends to be located 
21354,the numerical results of local scour for bridge piers are significantly affected by the inlet turbulent boundary conditions a novel self sustaining model ssm and corresponding the new inlet turbulent boundary conditions are proposed to quickly obtain a stable flow field of horizontal homogeneity the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations and standard k ԑ turbulence model are employed to solve the complex flow around the bridge piers based on the sediment transport model considering the effect of the arbitrary slope of riverbed and the collapse of sediment the dynamic evolution process of local scouring around bridge piers is simulated then the applicability of the numerical approach for local scour around bridge pier is validated by the flume test comparing with the flow pattern the maximum scour depth and the morphology of scour pit finally the influence factors of local scour for bridge piers including common pier shapes and different angle of attack are studied the numerical results indicate that the proposed ssm can develop homogeneous isotropic turbulence to fine simulate local scour with prescribed inlet turbulent boundary conditions the established sediment collapse model can reasonably reflect the collapse process in scouring importantly the proposed numerical methods can provide a reasonable prediction of maximum scour depth in

piers and abutments the over water area of the channel is compressed and the flow around a pier is accelerated in addition the turbulent fluctuations induced by piers also play a significant role in entraining bed sediment the accelerated flow and horseshoe vortex formed in the front of pier led to the sediment around piers transport to the downstream and the embedment depth of the pier foundation is reduced which lead to insufficient bearing capacity of the pier and abutment even overturn the occurrence and development process of scouring is very complex which involves the interaction between water flow sediment and structure hydraulic conditions sediment geological conditions and structure parameters have a significant impact on local scour for decades many researchers have conducted extensive research on local scour around structural foundations such as piers through flume tests e g melville and raudkivi 1977 dey and raikar 2007 ataie ashtiani et al 2010 wu et al 2015 liang et al 2016 tubaldi et al 2017 baghbadorani et al 2018 qi et al 2019 yang et al 2020 the main purpose is to accurately predict the maximum scour depth establish effective scour protection measures and ensure the safe operation of the bridge structure with the rapid development of the computer the numerical method based on computational fluid dynamics cfd is widely used in the numerical study of local scour of bridge foundation e g richardson and punchang 1998 jia and wang 1999 nagata et al 2005 roulund et al 2005 kirkil et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 bihs and olsen 2011 zhu et al 2014 baranya et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 jia et al 2017 ahmed moussa 2017 yu and zhu 2019 ahmad et al 2020 the cfd method boasts such advantages as quickly and conveniently change various boundary conditions which help to systematically study and analyze the influence and contribution of single factor variables to local scour visualize the flow phenomenon of various flow fields which help to understand the mechanism of local scour deeply in addition it can avoid the scale effect caused by the scale reduction model used in the flume test the disturbance caused by some monitoring instruments to the flow field and the difficulty of monitoring the flow field data near the wall to date many researchers olsen and melaaen 1993 olsen and kjellesvig 1998 salaheldin et al 2004 zhu and liu 2012 zhu et al 2014 baranya et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 adopted rans method to carry out the simulation of local scour around bridge foundation the three dimensional reynolds average navier stokes rans equation closed by the k ε turbulence model was employed to solve the complex flow field around the bridge piers the sediment transport models were applied to simulate the dynamic evolution of riverbed in scouring the rans models use the empirical wall function to deal with the flow in the viscous sublayer near the riverbed which can reduce the number of meshes save calculation time and mainly adapt better to the deformation of dynamic mesh avoiding the mesh distortion during the large deformation of the riverbed in local scour process but rans models have some drawbacks in simulating local scour of the pier which cannot directly resolve subscale vortex turbulent fluctuations and coherent structures these turbulence characteristics have a significant influence on entrainment of sediment which causes the change of the location where the maximum scour depth occur however using des les and dns models can address above these drawbacks well zhang and ishihara 2018 kirkil et al 2009 applied the detached eddy simulation method to revel the dynamic characteristics of large scale coherent eddies in the flow around a cylinder pier alemi et al 2017 developed les model to predict the flow features around a single cylinder pier on the preformed scoured bed ettema et al 2017 reviewed the status of numerical simulation on local scour around bridge piers using cfd methods the advantages and disadvantages of rans models compared with les and dns models have been discussed in their opinion the les and dns models were used to simulating the flow field around piers with preformed scour holes only thus before les des and dns models are made capable of simulating process of sediment transport and local scour over time effectively and efficiently rans models are still useful for studies on local scour around piers jia et al 2017 from the previous simulation results zhu and liu 2012 zhu et al 2014 baranya et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the location of maximum scour depth obtained by numerical simulation is on both sides of the pier which is different from the results observed by flume experiment this is mainly due to the effect of the turbulent fluctuation which is associated with the turbulent kinetic energy tke of the approach flow and induced by pier is not correctly considered in simulating of local scour the velocity and bed shear stress in the front of the pier computed by rans models are relatively small since the top boundary in the computational domain is often set as a symmetry boundary condition based on the rigid cover assumption which is help to improve the computational efficiency the absence of free surface leads to the lack of energy supply the prescribed inlet boundary conditions including the velocity and the tke profiles in generally is deemed the fully developed turbulence which possess the homogeneous isotropic that is the velocity and tke along the computational domain should be self sustaining actually the prescribed inlet boundary conditions will decay along the stream wise in calculation domain since the energy is consumed continually by the shearing effect of fluid according to the traditional method therefore it is not so reasonable to adopt the traditional inlet boundary conditions to carry out the simulation of local scour in addition the simulated scour pit in the previous studies zhu et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 appeared sharp peak mainly because the influence of sediment collapse process is not considered that is when the slope angle of scour pit wall is larger than that of the angle of sediment repose the wall of scour pit will collapse and reestablish a new equilibrium state therefore this paper also considers the establishment of sediment collapse model to reflect the actual physical phenomenon of scour pit wall the main aim of the present study is to derive a novel self sustaining model ssm and corresponding the new inlet turbulent boundary conditions to quickly achieve the flow field of homogeneous isotropic the program of local scour for bridge piers which includes self sustaining inlet turbulent boundary conditions the sediment transport model considering the effect of the arbitrary slope of bed and the collapse of sediment and mesh update algorithm was redeveloped based on the fluent software by c language to simulate the dynamic evolution process of local scour around bridge piers then the applicability of the proposed numerical method is verified by the flume test finally the influence factors of local scour around bridge piers including common pier shapes and different angle of attack are studied 2 numerical methods 2 1 turbulent model for the numerical simulation of local scour around bridge piers the complex flows around bridge piers can be expressed by the three dimensional incompressible reynolds average navier stokes equation which is shown as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x j μ x j u i x j x j ρ u i u j f i where t is time μ is the dynamic viscosity p is the pressure acting on the surface of a small fluid control volumes f i is the volume force acting on the small fluid control volumes and ρ is the density u i and u i are the time averaged velocity component u v w and instantaneous velocity component u v w in the i direction i 1 2 3 for the cartesian coordinates x y z respectively ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress due to the introducing of the reynolds stress the n s equation above is no longer closed thus we convert the solution of the reynolds stress into the determination of eddy viscosity coefficient in eddy viscosity models on the basis of the boussinesq hypothesis assumed the u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j k in which μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε is turbulent viscosity k is the tke δ i j is the kronecker symbol ε is turbulent energy dissipation rate c μ is empirical constants the determination of turbulent viscosity needs the solution of the k ε turbulence model and the corresponding governing equations are shown as eqs 3 and 4 3 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε s k 4 t ρ ε x i ρ ε u i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε ε k g k c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k s ε where g k is the generated term of the tke which is caused by the average velocity gradient and g k ρ u i u j u j x i also based on the boussinesq hypothesis g k μ t u z 2 s k and s ε are the source items that defined by the users c μ c 1 ε c 2 ε σ k σ ε are the empirical constants which are normally taken as c μ 0 09 σ k 1 0 σ ε 1 3 c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 92 in the standard k ε turbulence model 2 2 boundary conditions 2 2 1 inlet boundary condition in previous cfd based local scour simulation of bridge pier the inlet turbulent boundary conditions including the velocity and tke profile are assumed to be constants or fully developed turbulence which is invariant along the flow direction before being affected by the structure however the essence of turbulence is dissipative and turbulent motion must be accompanied by the consumption of mechanical energy if there is no external energy to provide energy supplement the stable turbulent motion will not be maintained and will inevitably gradually decay based on the rigid cover assumptions the free surface top boundary is normally set to symmetry boundary the top boundary cannot provide energy for the turbulent motion through the shear layer which causes the turbulence boundary condition prescribed at the inlet to decay along the flow direction according to the traditional inlet boundary conditions the turbulent motion will be inconsistent with the actual physical process this will also directly affect the accuracy of the numerical results for local scour with the prescribed inlet turbulent boundary conditions therefore a novel ssm is proposed to simulate the equilibrium turbulent boundary layer to obtain the horizontal uniformity turbulence the so called horizontal uniformity above means that by satisfying local turbulence equilibrium the given inlet turbulent boundary conditions can be partially or completely self sustaining the ssm of the standard k ε turbulence model is derived based on the local turbulence equilibrium hypothesis assuming that the generated term of the tke is equal to that of dissipation which is g k ρ ε then we can have eqs 5 and 6 5 ε c μ 1 2 k z u z 6 ε z c μ 1 2 k z u z c μ 1 2 k 2 u z 2 ε k k z ε u z 2 u z 2 assuming that the flow velocity profile is in the logarithmic distribution we have 7 u u k ln z z 0 z 0 where k is the von karman s constant generally 0 41 u is friction velocity z 0 is roughness length substituting eqs 5 7 into eqs 3 and 4 we have 8 c μ σ k z k 2 ε k z 0 9 k z 2 k 2 k z 2 2 k z k z c 1 ε c 2 ε σ ε k 2 u 2 k z 2 k 2 z 2 0 then combining eqs 5 8 and 9 and the derived expression is shown in table 1 which is the expression of the self sustaining inlet turbulent boundary conditions where b 1 b 2 are obtained by the least square nonlinear fitting based on the flume experiment data the specific derivation processes and parameter determination methods can be found in yu et al 2020 2 2 2 wall boundary conditions normally the flows are not fully developed turbulence in viscous sublayer the standard k ε turbulence model is not suitable low reynolds number region thus for the viscous sublayer it is necessary to adopt the empirical wall law generally the most common empirical law is the logarithm law which is shown in eq 10 10 u u u 1 k ln e y where u is the non dimensional velocity u τ ω ρ is the friction velocity y u y b ν is the dimensionless length which is set as 30 y 60 xiong et al 2014 τ ω is the wall shear stress y b is the distance to the wall and v is the kinematic viscosity e is the roughness parameter approximately equal to 9 0 for a smooth wall then the calculation formula of the wall shear stress is derived as eq 11 11 τ ω k ρ c μ 1 4 k 1 2 u ln e y ρ ν y 11 225 y 11 225 2 3 sediment model 2 3 1 sediment transport model considering the effect of arbitrary slope according to the shields equation van rijn 1984a 1984b the critical shear stress on the flat riverbed τ b c r can be expressed as eq 12 12 τ b c r ρ g s 1 d 50 θ c r where g is gravitational acceleration s ρ s ρ is the relative density ρ s is sediment density d 50 is the median particle size of sediment and θ c r is the critical shields number the expression of θ c r is shown as eq 13 in which d d 50 s 1 g v 2 1 3 13 θ c r 0 24 d 1 d 4 0 14 d 0 64 4 d 10 0 04 d 0 1 10 d 20 0 13 d 0 29 20 d 150 0 055 d 150 the tangential component of gravity will affect the transport of bed load it is not appropriate to directly use the shields equation to calculate the wall shear stress of the flat riverbed the topography of the natural riverbed and the wall of the scour pit generated in scour process are not flat there is slope in the present study the equivalent shear stress of riverbed is calculated using a sediment transport model which can consider the influence of arbitrary slope of riverbed which is eqs 14 and 15 chen et al 2010 the equivalent shear stress is derived based on the resultant force of the drag force and gravity of water in the numerical simulation process the model above can not only reflect the influence of arbitrary slope of riverbed on sediment transport but also avoid the problem of infinite sediment transport rate when the bed shear stress tends to 0 for the van rijn sediment model van rijn 1984a 1984b which is used in previous cfd simulations of local scour zhu et al 2014 14 τ s c e τ b c r cos

riverbed and z directions τ b e is the equivalent shear stress on the sloping riverbed τ b is the shear stress on the riverbed ϕ is the angle of sediment repose ω z is the direction cosine in the z direction the threshold for sediment transport is determined by the dimensionless shear stress t which is shown as eq 16 and the calculating formula of sediment transport rate is shown as eq 17 zhu et al 2014 16 t τ b e τ s c e τ s c e 17 q b 0 053 s 1 g d 50 1 5 t 2 1 d 0 3 the total sediment transport rate q b can be decomposed into streamwise sediment transport rate q b x and cross flow sediment

the direction cosine in the x and y directions α β are the streamwise and cross flow riverbed slop respectively respectively ξ δ are the angles between normal direction of riverbed and x y directions respectively finally the variation equation of the bed with time can be obtained based on the principle of sediment transportation balance eq 20 20 z t 1 1 n q b x x q b y y 2 3 2 sediment collapse model as is known that when the slope of the local scour pit reaches the angle of sediment repose in the process of local scour the collapse will take place for scour pit wall to truly reflect the sediment collapse process during local scour the sediment collapse model is established to take account of the influence of sediment collapse on the topography and depth of scour pit the following sediment collapse model and the corresponding action mechanism are introduced as follows fig 1 is the schematic diagram of sediment collapse model in the calculating process the global mesh nodes at the bottom of the river bed are scanned after updating the changes of river bed elevation during the scanning process when the inclination angle of the connection between node a and node b is greater than the sediment repose angle ϕ node a is raised to node a and node b is lowered to node b to make the dip angle between line ab and the horizontal plane smaller than the sediment repose angle ϕ the variation of a and b points is solved by the geometric relation between them eq 21 and sediment transport conservation eq 22 21 z b δ z b z a δ z a tan ϕ x a x b 2 y a y b 2 22 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6

area of the adjacent surface between a and b 3 numerical implementation 3 1 physical model experiment the melville flume test is referenced in this research melville 1975 the flume is 19 m long 45 6 cm wide and 15 cm deep the slope of the stream bed is 1 10000 and the diameter of pier d was 5 08 cm the bed sediment is in the diameter d 50 of 0 385 mm and the angle of repose of sediment is 32 besides the average flow velocity is 0 25 m s the reynolds number based on pier diameter is re d 12677 and the froude number f r 0 13 the simulated mean velocity profile and tke profile in front of the pier are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 according to the ssm the fitting parameters of the new inlet turbulent boundary in table 1 are shown as follows u 0 0118 z 0 0 000013 b 1 0 14 b 2 1 69 c u 0 015 3 2 numerical model and discrete method the schematic diagram of the computational domain and boundary conditions for cfd simulation of local scour around cylinder piers is shown in fig 4 the distance from the inlet of the calculation domain to the pier is 6d and the distance from the pier to the outlet is 12d according to the research by sarker 1998 the width of the calculation domain is set as the width of the actual physical test flume which is 45 6 cm and the height of the calculation domain is set as the water depth of 15 cm the unstructured tetrahedral mesh is adopted for the spatial discretization of the computational domain to better fit the topography change and improve the negative volume during the updating process of the dynamic mesh technique besides the mesh is locally refined near the pier and riverbed where the gradient of flow variables is relatively large see fig 5 the specific mesh parameters are shown in table 2 in which l max l min are the maximum mesh size and minimum mesh size respectively the mean velocity and tke profiles are shown in figs 2 and 3 are adopted as inlet turbulent boundary conditions before the cfd simulation of local scour around bridge pier the horizontal uniformity of the flow field in the same size calculation domain without piers need to be tested the outlet of the calculation domain is set as newman boundary condition in other words the normal gradient of each turbulence characteristic quantity in the outlet section is zero besides smooth wall boundary is adopted on both sides of the calculation domain the riverbed and the surface of pier are set as a rough wall boundary without sliding according to the study by yu and zhu 2019 the rough height on the boundary is set as 2 5d 50 the free surface was set as a symmetry boundary based on the rigid lid hypothesis which means that both the normal velocity of the boundary and the normal gradient of other turbulent characteristic quantities are zero according to the methods of the parameter sensitivity analysis and optimization by yu et al 2020 the standard k ε turbulence model parameters are optimized as c μ 0 015 σ k 2 04 σ ε 2 86 c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 92 these parameters will be used for subsequent cfd simulation of local scour around bridge piers the detailed numerical strategies are introduced as follows the finite volume method based on the collocated grid is used for the special discretization the first order implicit scheme is adopted for time discretization the second order upwind scheme is adopted for the convection term and the central difference scheme is used for the diffusion term the simple algorithm and under relaxation iterative technique are used for velocity pressure decoupling the iterative convergence residual of the specified variables such as continuity equation velocity and tke are 1 10 6 the meshes of the computational domain are updated and reconstructed using the smoothing method and the remeshing method in dynamic mesh technique in order to distinguish the unsteady characteristics of flow over blunt body effectively the time step should be no less than that 1 200 1 500 of the vortex shedding period according to the reported by xiong et al 2014 y which is wall coordinate should be limited in the range of 30 y 300 y y ρ τ ω μ in which y is the distance of the cell center away from the wall thus the logarithm law is applicable the detailed flow chart of the numerical calculation process is shown as fig 6 4 numerical validation 4 1 horizontal uniformity examination of flow field fig 7 shows the comparison of horizontal uniformity of flow field in the calculation domain without pier including the velocity and tke profiles at the inlet model region l 3 and outlet it can be seen that the velocity and tke profiles by traditional method changed along the streamwise direction especially the tke profile the inlet turbulent boundary conditions derived by ssm show well self sustaining characteristics along the streamwise direction which can obtain the horizontal uniformity of flow field and provide the basis for the prediction of local scour around bridge pier under the prescribed inlet turbulent boundary conditions 4 2 initial scour phase fig 8 shows the comparison of simulated result and experimental result of streamlines near the riverbed the simulated streamlines around cylinder pier near the riverbed are similar to the experimental result in particular a similar backflow area is formed in the wake area of the pier fig 9 shows the instantaneous shear stress on riverbed before scouring the sediment transport in the process of local scour around pier is considered by bed shear stress the maximum bed shear stress is 0 6 pa which appears in the area between the two sides of the cylinder pier facing the water and the x axis about 75 135 the location where the local scour occurs firstly corresponds to the maximum bed shear stress on the riverbed as shown in fig 10 which is consistent with the phenomenon observed in the melville experiment 4 3 intermediate scour phase fig 11 shows the contour of scour pit after 30 min obtained from simulation and experiment as can be seen from the figure the maximum scour depth at this time is about 4 3 cm but the morphology of the scour pit is different the maximum scour depth obtained by simulation occurs on both sides of the pier while the maximum scour depth obtained by the experiment is in front of the pier fig 12 and fig 13 show the elevation of riverbed after 30 min in streamwise and cross flow direction respectively the location of maximum scour depth observed from the different angle of view also occurs on both sides of the pier which is symmetry about the central axis surface of the pier along the streamwise direction the sizes of formed scour pit are about 2 5d and 6d in front and back of the pier the influence range of local scour on both sides of the pier is about 3d but the main scour area is concentrated in 2d the slope angle of the formed scour pit wall is about 31 which is close to the 32 degrees of the sediment repose angle in experiment this indicates that the sediment collapse model adopted can reasonably reflect the sediment collapse process in the simulation of local scour 4 4 equilibrium scour phase fig 14 shows the comparison of the velocity vector in plane of symmetry obtained by simulation and experiment the typical features of simulated results observed in front of the cylinder pier is the downward flow and the horseshoe vortex as like the experiment results also the wake vortex behind the pier observed in simulated results fig 15 shows the contour of scour pit under equilibrium scour at this time the maximum scour depth of the riverbed reaches 6 5 cm which is consistent with the experiment results in addition compared with the previous scour 30 min the scour depth and the size of scour pit are gradually developed and increased but the position where the maximum scour depth occurs is not changed and still on both sides of the pier this is different from the final experiment result but the scour depth at the front edge of the pier simulated by the new inlet turbulent boundary conditions derived from the ssm has reached 5 cm which is closer to the experiment result comparing to the simulating results obtained by the traditional inlet turbulent boundary condition the reason for this phenomenon is that the sediment entrainment and transport in upstream are mainly associated with the turbulence which includes the turbulence in the approach flow and aroused by the bridge pier the turbulence near riverbed is considered in the form of tke through the bed shear stress in fact according to the research of yu et al 2020 this part of the turbulence transmitted by the approach flow will decay along the streamwise direction using the conventional inlet turbulent boundary conditions therefore the method proposed in this paper power of the water flow but this part of the turbulence needs additional bed shear stress to simulate according to the studies of jia et al 2017 the local scour with rans models cannot be reasonably simulated if the effect of the tke is not accounted for adequately fig 16 shows the comparison of the morphology of scour pit under equilibrium scour from the comparison of the side view of fig 16 a and b it can be clearly observed that there is no sharp peak at the bottom of the scour pit using the sediment collapse model established in this paper the process of sediment collapse and re equilibrium are well simulated the comparison between the top view ensures the contribution of the turbulence transmitted by the approach flow to the local scour depth and improves the simulation results of the front edge of the pier besides the downward flow formed by the resistance of the pier strengthens the entrainment and transport of fig 16 c and d shows that the development range of scour pit simulated by the presented method and the traditional method is also different the simulation results by the presented method are closer to the experimental results 5 effect of pier shape in common pier shapes except the cylinder pier there are also square nose pier round nose pier and sharp nose pier the local scour around bridge piers varies with the shape of the pier including the maximum scour depth the location of the maximum scour depth and the morphology of the scour pit then the numerical simulation of local scour around the different shape of piers is carried out according to the method described above fig 17 and fig 18 show the computational domain and mesh in the computational domain of common pier shapes the distance of the inlet and outlet to the pier in the computational domain the partition strategy of the mesh in computational domain both are consistent with the front cylinder pier the width and the length of three common piers are all d cylinder pier diameter and 3d respectively the height is the same as the cylinder pier the specific mesh parameters are shown in table 3 fig 19 shows the instantaneous shear stress on river bed before scouring for common pier shapes including square nose pier round nose pier and sharp nose pier combined with the instantaneous shear stress diagram of the cylinder pier in fig 9 the bed shear stress around the square nose pier is the largest reaching 0 7 pa and the bed shear stress of the round nose pier is the smallest which is only 0 5 pa the maximum bed shear stress of the sharp nose pier is comparable to that of the cylinder pier which is 0 6 pa the difference of bed shear stress around different pier shape may be caused by the difference of flow mode around the pier fig 20 shows the contour of scour pit under equilibrium scour and fig 21 shows the three dimensional morphology of scour pit under equilibrium scour where fig 20 a is the scour pit around square nose pier fig 20 b is the scour pit around round nose pier and fig 20 c is the scour pit around sharp nose pier the maximum scour depth of three shapes of pier corresponding the square nose round nose and sharp nose are 6 9 cm 6 5 cm and 6 1 cm respectively among the four types of piers the scour depth of square nose pier is the largest and that of sharp nose pier is the smallest this is related to their flow pattern the square nose pier belongs to the blunt body the water resistance area in front of the pier is relatively large which causes the relatively strong downward flow and enhances the entrainment power of water flow the sharp nose pier is close to the streamlined type which weakens the blocking effect of the front of the pier on the approach flow and the turbulence caused by the pier in these three cases the location of the maximum scour around the pier is still on both side of the pier like the cylinder pier there is a certain distance from the pier to the occurrence location of the maximum scour the maximum scour depth of the round nose pier occurs in the area between 35 115 with the central axis in the flow direction while that of the cylinder pier occurs between about 35 135 with the central axis in the flow direction the maximum scour depth of the square nose and sharp nose piers occur in the area between 35 90 and 75 115 with the central axis in the flow direction respectively the influence area clearly affected by scour of four piers is basically same the width of influence is 6d the length of influence area in front and back of the pier are 3d and 5d approximately the scour depth over the time for different shapes pier is shown in the fig 22 the slope of the curve in the figure actually represents the scour rate in the stage of the initial scour the scour rate of the square nose pier is the largest since the blocking effect caused by square nose pier is the largest which increases the velocity of flow around the pier and the bed shear stress when is close to the equilibrium scour the bed shear stress decreases gradually because of the development of scour pit the rate of scour in the four kinds of shapes pier decrease gradually 6 effect of angle of attack in addition to the shape of the pier the angle of attack is a very important factor which affects the maximum scour depth next the round nose pier is selected as the research object to study the influence of the angle of attack on the maximum scour depth the fig 23 show the mesh in the computational domain for different angles of attack including 5 15 30 and 45 angle rotates counterclockwise along the x axis and gradually increases as seen from fig 24 the existence of angle of attack will increase the maximum scour depth around the round nose pier and the maximum scour depth increase with the increase of angle of attack the scour depth of 6 cm corresponding to 0 angle of attack increases gradually to 14 cm corresponding to 45 angle of attack the position of the maximum scour depth usually occurs at the winding side of the front edge of the round nose pier because of the increase of the blocking area of the water flow after the pier body rotates the scour depth of the wake area behind the pier is obviously smaller than that in front of the pier the three dimensional morphology of scour pit under equilibrium scour for different angles of attack are shown in fig 25 7 conclusions the three dimensional numerical simulation of local scour around common pier shapes was investigated in the present study based on the numerical results the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the proposed novel ssm and the corresponding inlet turbulent boundary conditions can quickly obtain a stable flow field of horizontal homogeneity which is help to fine simulate local scour with prescribed inlet turbulent boundary conditions 2 the established sediment collapse model can reasonably reflect the collapse process when the slope of the scour pit wall reached the sediment repose angle that can avoid the numerical divergence induced by mesh distortion and sharp peak formed during the updating of mesh 3 the presented numerical methods can provide a reasonable prediction of maximum scour depth and improve the development of the scour depth in front of the bridge piers induced by the turbulence in the approach flow the tke induced by bridge piers which are simulated in rans model is not accounted for adequately in which the capability of entraining bed sediments needs to be considered through additional shear stress in the future works 4 the scour depth of the square nose pier is the largest and that of the sharp nose pier is the smallest among the four shapes pier this is related to the different flow patterns around piers of different shapes the shape of the pier has a significant influence on the scour depth the location of the maximum scour depth and has a little effect on the area of the scour pit 5 the performances of the local scouring are greatly sensitive to the angle of attack the existence of angle of attack will increase the maximum scour depth around bridge piers and the maximum scour depth increase with the increase of angle of

piers and abutments the over water area of the channel is compressed and the flow around a pier is accelerated in addition the turbulent fluctuations induced by piers also play a significant role in entraining bed sediment the accelerated flow and horseshoe vortex formed in the front of pier led to the sediment around piers transport to the downstream and the embedment depth of the pier foundation is reduced which lead to insufficient bearing capacity of the pier and abutment even overturn the occurrence and development process of scouring is very complex which involves the interaction between water flow sediment and structure hydraulic conditions sediment geological conditions and structure parameters have a significant impact on local scour for decades many researchers have conducted extensive research on local scour around structural foundations such as piers through flume tests e g melville and raudkivi 1977 dey and raikar 2007 ataie ashtiani et al 2010 wu et al 2015 liang et al 2016 tubaldi et al 2017 baghbadorani et al 2018 qi et al 2019 yang et al 2020 the main purpose is to accurately predict the maximum scour depth establish effective scour protection measures and ensure the safe operation of the bridge structure with the rapid development of the computer the numerical method based on computational fluid dynamics cfd is widely used in the numerical study of local scour of bridge foundation e g richardson and punchang 1998 jia and wang 1999 nagata et al 2005 roulund et al 2005 kirkil et al 2009 zhao et al 2010 bihs and olsen 2011 zhu et al 2014 baranya et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 jia et al 2017 ahmed moussa 2017 yu and zhu 2019 ahmad et al 2020 the cfd method boasts such advantages as quickly and conveniently change various boundary conditions which help to systematically study and analyze the influence and contribution of single factor variables to local scour visualize the flow phenomenon of various flow fields which help to understand the mechanism of local scour deeply in addition it can avoid the scale effect caused by the scale reduction model used in the flume test the disturbance caused by some monitoring instruments to the flow field and the difficulty of monitoring the flow field data near the wall to date many researchers olsen and melaaen 1993 olsen and kjellesvig 1998 salaheldin et al 2004 zhu and liu 2012 zhu et al 2014 baranya et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 adopted rans method to carry out the simulation of local scour around bridge foundation the three dimensional reynolds average navier stokes rans equation closed by the k ε turbulence model was employed to solve the complex flow field around the bridge piers the sediment transport models were applied to simulate the dynamic evolution of riverbed in scouring the rans models use the empirical wall function to deal with the flow in the viscous sublayer near the riverbed which can reduce the number of meshes save calculation time and mainly adapt better to the deformation of dynamic mesh avoiding the mesh distortion during the large deformation of the riverbed in local scour process but rans models have some drawbacks in simulating local scour of the pier which cannot directly resolve subscale vortex turbulent fluctuations and coherent structures these turbulence characteristics have a significant influence on entrainment of sediment which causes the change of the location where the maximum scour depth occur however using des les and dns models can address above these drawbacks well zhang and ishihara 2018 kirkil et al 2009 applied the detached eddy simulation method to revel the dynamic characteristics of large scale coherent eddies in the flow around a cylinder pier alemi et al 2017 developed les model to predict the flow features around a single cylinder pier on the preformed scoured bed ettema et al 2017 reviewed the status of numerical simulation on local scour around bridge piers using cfd methods the advantages and disadvantages of rans models compared with les and dns models have been discussed in their opinion the les and dns models were used to simulating the flow field around piers with preformed scour holes only thus before les des and dns models are made capable of simulating process of sediment transport and local scour over time effectively and efficiently rans models are still useful for studies on local scour around piers jia et al 2017 from the previous simulation results zhu and liu 2012 zhu et al 2014 baranya et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the location of maximum scour depth obtained by numerical simulation is on both sides of the pier which is different from the results observed by flume experiment this is mainly due to the effect of the turbulent fluctuation which is associated with the turbulent kinetic energy tke of the approach flow and induced by pier is not correctly considered in simulating of local scour the velocity and bed shear stress in the front of the pier computed by rans models are relatively small since the top boundary in the computational domain is often set as a symmetry boundary condition based on the rigid cover assumption which is help to improve the computational efficiency the absence of free surface leads to the lack of energy supply the prescribed inlet boundary conditions including the velocity and the tke profiles in generally is deemed the fully developed turbulence which possess the homogeneous isotropic that is the velocity and tke along the computational domain should be self sustaining actually the prescribed inlet boundary conditions will decay along the stream wise in calculation domain since the energy is consumed continually by the shearing effect of fluid according to the traditional method therefore it is not so reasonable to adopt the traditional inlet boundary conditions to carry out the simulation of local scour in addition the simulated scour pit in the previous studies zhu et al 2014 xiong et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 appeared sharp peak mainly because the influence of sediment collapse process is not considered that is when the slope angle of scour pit wall is larger than that of the angle of sediment repose the wall of scour pit will collapse and reestablish a new equilibrium state therefore this paper also considers the establishment of sediment collapse model to reflect the actual physical phenomenon of scour pit wall the main aim of the present study is to derive a novel self sustaining model ssm and corresponding the new inlet turbulent boundary conditions to quickly achieve the flow field of homogeneous isotropic the program of local scour for bridge piers which includes self sustaining inlet turbulent boundary conditions the sediment transport model considering the effect of the arbitrary slope of bed and the collapse of sediment and mesh update algorithm was redeveloped based on the fluent software by c language to simulate the dynamic evolution process of local scour around bridge piers then the applicability of the proposed numerical method is verified by the flume test finally the influence factors of local scour around bridge piers including common pier shapes and different angle of attack are studied 2 numerical methods 2 1 turbulent model for the numerical simulation of local scour around bridge piers the complex flows around bridge piers can be expressed by the three dimensional incompressible reynolds average navier stokes equation which is shown as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t ρ u i u j x j p x j μ x j u i x j x j ρ u i u j f i where t is time μ is the dynamic viscosity p is the pressure acting on the surface of a small fluid control volumes f i is the volume force acting on the small fluid control volumes and ρ is the density u i and u i are the time averaged velocity component u v w and instantaneous velocity component u v w in the i direction i 1 2 3 for the cartesian coordinates x y z respectively ρ u i u j is the reynolds stress due to the introducing of the reynolds stress the n s equation above is no longer closed thus we convert the solution of the reynolds stress into the determination of eddy viscosity coefficient in eddy viscosity models on the basis of the boussinesq hypothesis assumed the u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j k in which μ t ρ c μ k 2 ε is turbulent viscosity k is the tke δ i j is the kronecker symbol ε is turbulent energy dissipation rate c μ is empirical constants the determination of turbulent viscosity needs the solution of the k ε turbulence model and the corresponding governing equations are shown as eqs 3 and 4 3 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j μ μ t σ k k x j g k ρ ε s k 4 t ρ ε x i ρ ε u i x j μ μ t σ ε ε x j c 1 ε ε k g k c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k s ε where g k is the generated term of the tke which is caused by the average velocity gradient and g k ρ u i u j u j x i also based on the boussinesq hypothesis g k μ t u z 2 s k and s ε are the source items that defined by the users c μ c 1 ε c 2 ε σ k σ ε are the empirical constants which are normally taken as c μ 0 09 σ k 1 0 σ ε 1 3 c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 92 in the standard k ε turbulence model 2 2 boundary conditions 2 2 1 inlet boundary condition in previous cfd based local scour simulation of bridge pier the inlet turbulent boundary conditions including the velocity and tke profile are assumed to be constants or fully developed turbulence which is invariant along the flow direction before being affected by the structure however the essence of turbulence is dissipative and turbulent motion must be accompanied by the consumption of mechanical energy if there is no external energy to provide energy supplement the stable turbulent motion will not be maintained and will inevitably gradually decay based on the rigid cover assumptions the free surface top boundary is normally set to symmetry boundary the top boundary cannot provide energy for the turbulent motion through the shear layer which causes the turbulence boundary condition prescribed at the inlet to decay along the flow direction according to the traditional inlet boundary conditions the turbulent motion will be inconsistent with the actual physical process this will also directly affect the accuracy of the numerical results for local scour with the prescribed inlet turbulent boundary conditions therefore a novel ssm is proposed to simulate the equilibrium turbulent boundary layer to obtain the horizontal uniformity turbulence the so called horizontal uniformity above means that by satisfying local turbulence equilibrium the given inlet turbulent boundary conditions can be partially or completely self sustaining the ssm of the standard k ε turbulence model is derived based on the local

fitting based on the flume experiment data the specific derivation processes and parameter determination methods can be found in yu et al 2020 2 2 2 wall boundary conditions normally the flows are not fully developed turbulence in viscous sublayer the standard k ε turbulence model is not suitable low reynolds number region thus for the viscous sublayer it is necessary to adopt the empirical wall

equal to 9 0 for a smooth wall then the calculation formula of the wall shear stress is derived as eq 11 11 τ ω k ρ c μ 1 4 k 1 2 u ln e y ρ ν y 11 225 y 11 225 2 3 sediment model 2 3 1 sediment transport model considering the effect of arbitrary slope according to the shields equation van rijn 1984a 1984b the critical shear stress on the flat riverbed τ b c r can be expressed as eq 12 12 τ b c r ρ g s 1 d 50 θ c r where g is gravitational acceleration s ρ s ρ is the relative density ρ s is sediment density d 50 is the median particle size of sediment and θ c r is the critical shields number the expression of θ c r is shown as eq 13 in which d d 50 s 1 g v 2 1 3 13 θ c r 0 24 d 1 d 4 0 14 d 0 64 4 d 10 0 04 d 0 1 10 d 20 0 13 d 0 29 20 d 150 0 055 d 150 the tangential component of gravity will affect the transport of bed load it is not appropriate to directly use the shields equation to calculate the wall shear stress of the flat riverbed the topography of the natural riverbed and the wall of the scour pit generated in scour process are not flat there is slope in the present study the equivalent shear stress of riverbed is calculated using a sediment transport model which can consider the influence of arbitrary slope of riverbed which is eqs 14 and 15 chen et al 2010 the equivalent shear stress is derived based on the resultant force of the drag force and gravity of water in the numerical simulation process the model above can not only reflect the influence of arbitrary slope of riverbed on sediment transport but also avoid the problem of infinite sediment transport rate when the bed shear stress tends to 0 for the van rijn sediment model van rijn 1984a 1984b which is used in previous cfd simulations of local scour zhu et al 2014 14 τ s c e τ b c r cos γ 15 τ b e τ b τ b c r τ b 2 sin 2 γ tan 2 ϕ 1 2 τ b c r τ b cos ω z tan ϕ where τ s c e is the equivalent critical shear stress on the sloping riverbed γ is the angles between normal direction of riverbed and z directions τ b e is the equivalent shear stress on the sloping riverbed τ b is the shear stress on the riverbed ϕ is the angle of sediment repose ω z is the direction cosine in the z direction the threshold for sediment transport is determined by the dimensionless shear stress t which is shown as eq 16 and the calculating formula of sediment transport rate is shown as eq 17 zhu et al 2014 16 t τ b e τ s c e τ s c e 17 q b 0 053 s 1 g d 50 1 5 t 2 1 d 0 3 the total sediment transport rate q b can be decomposed into streamwise sediment transport rate q b x and cross flow sediment

the direction cosine in the x and y directions α β are the streamwise and cross flow riverbed slop respectively respectively ξ δ are the angles between normal direction of riverbed and x y directions respectively finally the variation equation of the bed with time can be obtained based on the principle of sediment transportation balance eq 20 20 z t 1 1 n q b x x q b y y 2 3 2 sediment collapse model as is known that when the slope of the local scour pit reaches the angle of sediment repose in the process of local scour the collapse will take place for scour pit wall to truly reflect the sediment collapse process during local scour the sediment collapse model is established to take account of the influence of sediment collapse on the topography and depth of scour pit the following sediment collapse model and the corresponding action mechanism are introduced as follows fig 1 is the schematic diagram of sediment collapse model in the calculating process the global mesh nodes at the bottom of the river bed are scanned after updating the changes of river bed elevation during the scanning process when the inclination angle of the connection between node a and node b is greater than the sediment repose angle ϕ node a is raised to node a and node b is lowered to node b to make the dip angle between line ab and the horizontal plane smaller than the sediment repose angle ϕ the variation of a and b points is solved by the geometric relation between them eq 21 and sediment transport conservation eq 22 21 z b δ z b z a δ z a tan ϕ x a x b 2 y a y b 2 22 a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 a 5 a 6 δ z a a 3 a 4 a 7 a 8 a 9 a 10 δ z b where x a y a z a and x b y b z b are the coordinates of points a and b respectively δ z a δ z b are the variations of points a and b respectively a 1 a 10 is the area of the adjacent surface between a and b 3 numerical implementation 3 1 physical model experiment the melville flume test is referenced in this research melville 1975 the flume is 19 m long 45 6 cm wide and 15 cm deep the slope of the stream bed is 1 10000 and the diameter of pier d was 5 08 cm the bed sediment is in the diameter d 50 of 0 385 mm and the angle of repose of sediment is 32 besides the average flow velocity is 0 25 m s the reynolds number based on pier diameter is re d 12677 and the froude number f r 0 13 the simulated mean velocity profile and tke profile in front of the pier are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 according to the ssm the fitting parameters of the new inlet turbulent boundary in table 1 are shown as follows u 0 0118 z 0 0 000013 b 1 0 14 b 2 1 69 c u 0 015 3 2 numerical model and discrete method the schematic diagram of the computational domain and boundary conditions for cfd simulation of local scour around cylinder piers is shown in fig 4 the distance from the inlet of the calculation domain to the pier is 6d and the distance from the pier to the outlet is 12d according to the research by sarker 1998 the width of the calculation domain is set as the width of the actual physical test flume which is 45 6 cm and the height of the calculation domain is set as the water depth of 15 cm the unstructured tetrahedral mesh is adopted for the spatial discretization of the computational domain to better fit the topography change and improve the negative volume during the updating process of the dynamic mesh technique besides the mesh is locally refined near the pier and riverbed where the gradient of flow variables is relatively large see fig 5 the specific mesh parameters are shown in table 2 in which l max l min are the maximum mesh size and minimum mesh size respectively the mean velocity and tke profiles are shown in figs 2 and 3 are adopted as inlet turbulent boundary conditions before the cfd simulation of local scour around bridge pier the horizontal uniformity of the flow field in the same size calculation domain without piers need to be tested the outlet of the calculation domain is set as newman boundary condition in other words the normal gradient of each turbulence characteristic quantity in the outlet section is zero besides smooth wall boundary is adopted on both sides of the calculation domain the riverbed and the surface of pier are set as a rough wall boundary without sliding according to the study by yu and zhu 2019 the rough height on the boundary is set as 2 5d 50 the free surface was set as a symmetry boundary based on the rigid lid hypothesis which means that both the normal velocity of the boundary and the normal gradient of other turbulent characteristic quantities are zero according to the methods of the parameter sensitivity analysis and optimization by yu et al 2020 the standard k ε turbulence model parameters are optimized as c μ 0 015 σ k 2 04 σ ε 2 86 c 1 ε 1 44 c 2 ε 1 92 these parameters will be used for subsequent cfd simulation of local scour around bridge piers the detailed numerical strategies are introduced as follows the finite volume method based on the collocated grid is used for the special discretization the first order implicit scheme is adopted for time discretization the second order upwind scheme is adopted for the convection term and the central difference scheme is used for the diffusion term the simple algorithm and under relaxation iterative technique are used for velocity pressure decoupling the iterative convergence residual of the specified variables such as continuity equation velocity and tke are 1 10 6 the meshes of the computational domain are updated and reconstructed using the smoothing method and the remeshing method in dynamic mesh technique in order to distinguish the unsteady characteristics of flow over blunt body effectively the time step should be no less than that 1 200 1 500 of the vortex shedding period according to the reported by xiong et al 2014 y which is wall coordinate should be limited in the range of 30 y 300 y y ρ τ ω μ in which y is the distance of the cell center away from the wall thus the logarithm law is applicable the detailed flow chart of the numerical calculation process is shown as fig 6 4 numerical validation 4 1 horizontal uniformity examination of flow field fig 7 shows the comparison of horizontal uniformity of flow field in the calculation domain without pier including the velocity and tke profiles at the inlet model region l 3 and outlet it can be seen that the velocity and tke profiles by traditional method changed along the streamwise direction especially the tke profile the inlet turbulent boundary conditions derived by ssm show well self sustaining characteristics along the streamwise direction which can obtain the horizontal uniformity of flow field and provide the basis for the prediction of local scour around bridge pier under the prescribed inlet turbulent boundary conditions 4 2 initial scour phase fig 8 shows the comparison of simulated result and experimental result of streamlines near the riverbed the simulated streamlines around cylinder pier near the riverbed are similar to the experimental result in particular a similar backflow area is formed in the wake area of the pier fig 9 shows the instantaneous shear stress on riverbed before scouring the sediment transport in the process of local scour around pier is considered by bed shear stress the maximum bed shear stress is 0 6 pa which appears in the area between the two sides of the cylinder pier facing the water and the x axis about 75 135 the location where the local scour occurs firstly corresponds to the maximum bed shear stress on the riverbed as shown in fig 10 which is consistent with the phenomenon observed in the melville experiment 4 3 intermediate scour phase fig 11 shows the contour of scour pit after 30 min obtained from simulation and experiment as can be seen from the figure the maximum scour depth at this time is about 4 3 cm but the morphology of the scour pit is different the maximum scour depth obtained by simulation occurs on both sides of the pier while the maximum scour depth obtained by the experiment is in front of the pier fig 12 and fig 13 show the elevation of riverbed after 30 min in streamwise and cross flow direction respectively the location of maximum scour depth observed from the different angle of view also occurs on both sides of the pier which is symmetry about the central axis surface of the pier along the streamwise direction the sizes of formed scour pit are about 2 5d and 6d in front and back of the pier the influence range of local scour on both sides of the pier is about 3d but the main scour area is concentrated in 2d the slope angle of the formed scour pit wall is about 31 which is close to the 32 degrees of the sediment repose angle in experiment this indicates that the sediment collapse model adopted can reasonably reflect the sediment collapse process in the simulation of local scour 4 4 equilibrium scour phase fig 14 shows the comparison of the velocity vector in plane of symmetry obtained by simulation and experiment the typical features of simulated results observed in front of the cylinder pier is the downward flow and the horseshoe vortex as like the experiment results also the wake vortex behind the pier observed in simulated results fig 15 shows the contour of scour pit under equilibrium scour at this time the maximum scour depth of the riverbed reaches 6 5 cm which is consistent with the experiment results in addition compared with the previous scour 30 min the scour depth and the size of scour pit are gradually developed and increased but the position where the maximum scour depth occurs is not changed and still on both sides of the pier this is different from the final experiment result but the scour depth at the front edge of the pier simulated by the new inlet turbulent boundary conditions derived from the ssm has reached 5 cm which is closer to the experiment result comparing to the simulating results obtained by the traditional inlet turbulent boundary condition the reason for this phenomenon is that the sediment entrainment and transport in upstream are mainly associated with the turbulence which includes the turbulence in the approach flow and aroused by the bridge pier the turbulence near riverbed is considered in the form of tke through the bed shear stress in fact according to the research of yu et al 2020 this part of the turbulence transmitted by the approach flow will decay along the streamwise direction using the conventional inlet turbulent boundary conditions therefore the method proposed in this paper power of the water flow but this part of the turbulence needs additional bed shear stress to simulate according to the studies of jia et al 2017 the local scour with rans models cannot be reasonably simulated if the effect of the tke is not accounted for adequately fig 16 shows the comparison of the morphology of scour pit under equilibrium scour from the comparison of the side view of fig 16 a and b it can be clearly observed that there is no sharp peak at the bottom of the scour pit using the sediment collapse model established in this paper the process of sediment collapse and re equilibrium are well simulated the comparison between the top view ensures the contribution of the turbulence transmitted by the approach flow to the local scour depth and improves the simulation results of the front edge of the pier besides the downward flow formed by the resistance of the pier strengthens the entrainment and transport of fig 16 c and d shows that the development range of scour pit simulated by the presented method and the traditional method is also different the simulation results by the presented method are closer to the experimental results 5 effect of pier shape in common pier shapes except the cylinder pier there are also square nose pier round nose pier and sharp nose pier the local scour around bridge piers varies with the shape of the pier including the maximum scour depth the location of the maximum scour depth and the morphology of the scour pit then the numerical simulation of local scour around the different shape of piers is carried out according to the method described above fig 17 and fig 18 show the computational domain and mesh in the computational domain of common pier shapes the distance of the inlet and outlet to the pier in the computational domain the partition strategy of the mesh in computational domain both are consistent with the front cylinder pier the width and the length of three common piers are all d cylinder pier diameter and 3d respectively the height is the same as the cylinder pier the specific mesh parameters are shown in table 3 fig 19 shows the instantaneous shear stress on river bed before scouring for common pier shapes including square nose pier round nose pier and sharp nose pier combined with the instantaneous shear stress diagram of the cylinder pier in fig 9 the bed shear stress around the square nose pier is the largest reaching 0 7 pa and the bed shear stress of the round nose pier is the smallest which is only 0 5 pa the maximum bed shear stress of the sharp nose pier is comparable to that of the cylinder pier which is 0 6 pa the difference of bed shear stress around different pier shape may be caused by the difference of flow mode around the pier fig 20 shows the contour of scour pit under equilibrium scour and fig 21 shows the three dimensional morphology of scour pit under equilibrium scour where fig 20 a is the scour pit around square nose pier fig 20 b is the scour pit around round nose pier and fig 20 c is the scour pit around sharp nose pier the maximum scour depth of three shapes of pier corresponding the square nose round nose and sharp nose are 6 9 cm 6 5 cm and 6 1 cm respectively among the four types of piers the scour depth of square nose pier is the largest and that of sharp nose pier is the smallest this is related to their flow pattern the square nose pier belongs to the blunt body the water resistance area in front of the pier is relatively large which causes the relatively strong downward flow and enhances the entrainment power of water flow the sharp nose pier is close to the streamlined type which weakens the blocking effect of the front of the pier on the approach flow and the turbulence caused by the pier in these three cases the location of the maximum scour around the pier is still on both side of the pier like the cylinder pier there is a certain distance from the pier to the occurrence location of the maximum scour the maximum scour depth of the round nose pier occurs in the area between 35 115 with the central axis in the flow direction while that of the cylinder pier occurs between about 35 135 with the central axis in the flow direction the maximum scour depth of the square nose and sharp nose piers occur in the area between 35 90 and 75 115 with the central axis in the flow direction respectively the influence area clearly affected by scour of four piers is basically same the width of influence is 6d the length of influence area in front and back of the pier are 3d and 5d approximately the scour depth over the time for different shapes pier is shown in the fig 22 the slope of the curve in the figure actually represents the scour rate in the stage of the initial scour the scour rate of the square nose pier is the largest since the blocking effect caused by square nose pier is the largest which increases the velocity of flow around the pier and the bed shear stress when is close to the equilibrium scour the bed shear stress decreases gradually because of the development of scour pit the rate of scour in the four kinds of shapes pier decrease gradually 6 effect of angle of attack in addition to the shape of the pier the angle of attack is a very important factor which affects the maximum scour depth next the round nose pier is selected as the research object to study the influence of the angle of attack on the maximum scour depth the fig 23 show the mesh in the computational domain for different angles of attack including 5 15 30 and 45 angle rotates counterclockwise along the x axis and gradually increases as seen from fig 24 the existence of angle of attack will increase the maximum scour depth around the round nose pier and the maximum scour depth increase with the increase of angle of attack the scour depth of 6 cm corresponding to 0 angle of attack increases gradually to 14 cm corresponding to 45 angle of attack the position of the maximum scour depth usually occurs at the winding side of the front edge of the round nose pier because of the increase of the blocking area of the water flow after the pier body rotates the scour depth of the wake area behind the pier is obviously smaller than that in front of the pier the three dimensional morphology of scour pit under equilibrium scour for different angles of attack are shown in fig 25 7 conclusions the three dimensional numerical simulation of local scour around common pier shapes was investigated in the present study based on the numerical results the following conclusions can be obtained 1 the proposed novel ssm and the corresponding inlet turbulent boundary conditions can quickly obtain a stable flow field of horizontal homogeneity which is help to fine simulate local scour with prescribed inlet turbulent boundary conditions 2 the established sediment collapse model can reasonably reflect the collapse process when the slope of the scour pit wall reached the sediment repose angle that can avoid the numerical divergence induced by mesh distortion and sharp peak formed during the updating of mesh 3 the presented numerical methods can provide a reasonable prediction of maximum scour depth and improve the development of the scour depth in front of the bridge piers induced by the turbulence in the approach flow the tke induced by bridge piers which are simulated in rans model is not accounted for adequately in which the capability of entraining bed sediments needs to be considered through additional shear stress in the future works 4 the scour depth of the square nose pier is the largest and that of the sharp nose pier is the smallest among the four shapes pier this is related to the different flow patterns around piers of different shapes the shape of the pier has a significant influence on the scour depth the location of the maximum scour depth and has a little effect on the area of the scour pit 5 the performances of the local scouring are greatly sensitive to the angle of attack the existence of angle of attack will increase the maximum scour depth around bridge piers and the maximum scour depth increase with the increase of angle of
