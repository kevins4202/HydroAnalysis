15820,hydrodynamic cavitation was evaluated for its reactive oxygen species production in several convergent divergent microchannel at the transition from micro to milli scale channel widths and heights were systematically varied to study the influence of geometrical parameters at the transitory scale a photomultiplier tube was used for time resolved photon detection and monitoring of the chemiluminescent luminol oxidation reactions allowing for a contactless and in situ quantization of reactive oxygen species production in the channels the radical production rates at various flow parameters were evaluated showing an optimal yield per flow rate exists in the observed geometrical range while cavitation cloud shedding was the prevailing regime in this type of channels the photon arrival time analysis allowed for an investigation of the cavitation structure dynamics and their contribution to the chemical yield revealing that radical production is not linked to the synchronous

phase transition known as cavitation occurs as a pressure decrease in the liquid drives the vapor bubble growth and subsequent collapse as the pressure normalizes this can occur in liquids that are subjected to acoustic excitation ultrasonic cavitation uc or in hydrodynamic systems where a constriction in the flow causes a low pressure region to form due to bernoulli s principle hydrodynamic cavitation hc it is an established principle in cavitation bubble dynamics that the compression of the content during the rapid bubble collapse leads to high temperatures and pressures inside the bubble which can lead to plasma formation luminescence and exotic chemical species production including free radical and other highly reactive species suslick 1997 these species form due to the extreme thermodynamic conditions during peak collapse where homolytic splitting of water takes place and are thought to be critical in cavitation based advanced oxidizing processes wood et al 2017 such as material functionalization guittonneau et al 2010 fuel desulfurization cako et al 2022 and waste water treatment gągol et al 2018 lalwani et al 2020 zupanc et al 2019 the latter is often coupled with other advanced oxidation processes to achieve synergetic effects which can reduce the cost of such processes and make its use more feasible fedorov et al 2022 gągol et al 2020 however such treatment can be accompanied with unwanted nitration side reactions with toxic products that should be mitigated when the mineralization process is not complete rayaroth et al 2022 the chemical effects of cavitation are well known in uc suslick 1989 but have only in recent years started to be explored for hc gągol et al 2018 generally uc and hc have very different bubble dynamics as the former is based on periodic excitation while the latter is excited by a single low pressure pulse scaling down from macro to micro scale is expected to produce a more efficient bubble collapse as smaller bubble sizes should due to higher laplace pressure lead to better sphericity retention during the collapse phase as it can better resist the deformation due to pressure gradients in the flow and should therefore reach higher thermodynamic extremes in the bubble core at peak bubble collapse furthermore the bubble growth timescale at around 20µs can approach the single period of low frequency ultrasonic cavitation as was found in a recent study podbevšek et al 2021a hydrodynamic cavitation at the microscale is only beginning to be explored and offers a fundamental view into the hc phenomenon moreover microfluidic systems enable us to minimize the quantity of the liquids used crucial when studying minute quantities of toxic or exotic liquids as well as offering easy coupling with optical probing techniques ayela et al 2013 kim et al 2017 in such systems the liquids flowing through micro scale constrictions often have to be filtered to prevent clogging which can also remove the nuclei from the liquids allowing for liquid metastability often manifested as the delay in cavitation inception despite the advantages only a few groups use microfluidics to study the cavitation phenomenon aghdam et al 2019 ayela et al 2017 2013 cole et al 2006 gevari et al 2019 ghorbani 2021 ghorbani et al 2018b 2018c 2018a 2017b 2017a gothsch et al 2015 hosseinpour shafaghi et al 2021 medrano et al 2012 2011 mishra and peles 2006 2005a 2005b mishra and peles 2006 2005 mishra and peles 2004 mossaz et al 2017 nayebzadeh et al 2018 peles and schneider 2006 perrin et al 2021 podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a 2021b qiu et al 2019 2017 rokhsar talabazar et al 2021 rooze et al 2012 schneider et al 2007 singh and peles 2009 stieger et al 2017 cavitation cloud shedding is a typical and dominating event occurring in hydrodynamic cavitation often observed in convergent divergent and venturi channels at the macroscale typically these cavitation cloud structures grow until they shed off in a periodic manner usually with well defined shedding frequencies this can lead to a powerful and coordinated collapse of the main vapor cloud structure and the rest of the vapor bubbles in the channel due to the shockwave triggered by the main cloud collapse this simultaneous energetic event has been known to induce erosion noise and other phenomena in hydrodynamic cavitating flow dular et al 2006 there are several studies focusing on cavitation based radical production and waste water treatment usually aimed at specific pollutants typically requiring the analysis of the degradation product or trapping agents observing the degradation of p nitrol kalumuck and chahine 2000 rhodamine b mishra and gogate 2010 wang et al 2009 btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene braeutigam et al 2009 fedorov et al 2021 2020 benzene to phenol batoeva et al 2011 and the weissler reaction tri iodide oxidation gogate et al 2001 were all used to assess the oxidative potential of hc the latter was later shown to degrade even without the presence of cavitation possibly due to temperature increase or copper induces surface catalytic reactions morison and hutchinson 2009 terephthalic gielen et al 2016 and salicylic acid dosimetry arrojo et al 2007 arrojo and benito 2008 is also used for hydroxyl radical specific analysis but the latter has recently been shown to influence the surface tension in the liquid and thus effecting cavitation bubble dynamics zupanc et al 2020 so care must be taken in the interpretation of the results however the chemiluminescent cl reactions of luminol with radical species has been used to study radical production from ultrasonic fernandez rivas et al 2012 hatanaka et al 2002 mcmurray and wilson 1999 price et al 2010 renaudin et al 1994 rooze et al 2013 son et al 2020 yin et al 2014 and hydrodynamic cavitation perrin et al 2021 podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a schlender et al 2016 recently an in situ quantitative method based on single photon counting of luminol chemiluminescent reactions has been developed podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a which dramatically decreases the analysis time as the radical production is obtained from the detected photons without the need for time consuming sampling and chemical analysis the technique allows us to study in situ production of radicals in the channel in a non invasive manner this is important as the two phase hydrodynamic flows tend to be very sensitive to perturbations especially at the microscale in this article we study the scaling effect on primary hydroxyl radical production along with secondary recombinant reactive oxygen species ros with potential to oxidize luminol hereafter referred to as ros in micro to mill scale convergent divergent channels by quantifying luminol chemiluminescent reactions through single photon counting the ros yield was examined for different flow parameters in each of the six microchannels of varying geometries the cavitation cloud shedding event a typical periodic cavitation structure growth and collapse is present in most of the 0 10bar driving pressure range examined in this study by monitoring the photon arrival times and the vaporous structure dynamics we can uncover the relevant mechanism for radical production in microscale hydrodynamic cavitation reactors 2 material and methods 2 1 microfluidic channel geometry and flow parameters a series of microchannels were laser cut from 150 and 450 µm thick aisi 316l stainless steel sheets which determines the height h of the channel one side of the geometry is straight while the other forms a convergent divergent 18⁰ 10⁰ slope of the micro channel as seen on the electron microscope image of the constriction on fig 1 a b for the small and the large channel series respectively a symmetric channel design with both sides angled was initially considered however such channels showed various different cavitation regimes at a particular driving pressure similar to observations in certain micro diaphragms used in podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a which tend to stochastically interchange during measurement this design was eventually abandoned as it proved difficult to work with due to unstable flow conditions three constriction widths w 0 5h h and 1 5h for each channel height group with about 27mm from constriction to the end of the divergent part of channel the plate was placed between two acrylic glass plates together forming the microchannel assembly like the setup used in podbevšek et al 2021b when observing cavitation at the microscale a delay in cavitation inception is often observed due to the liquid metastability caused by the lack of nucleation sites medrano et al 2011 podbevsek et al 2018 for our channels the smaller 150µm heights channel group small series channels metastable flow could be easily observed while in the 450µm height channels large series channels the metastability was more subtle as nucleation is a stochastic process there is a certain probability that the liquid will cavitate at a given driving pressure pcav the pcav was measured for each channel by increasing the pressure in 0 1bar increments and allowing 10s for metastable flow to jump to cavitating flow if thermodynamically favorable this was averaged over 10 rounds with the standard deviation and measurement uncertainty amounting to less than 0 1bar for most channels the different dimensionless numbers used in the study are the hydraulic diameter dh 4a γ where γ is the perimeter of the channel constriction and a the cross sectional area the reynolds number re v dh ν v being the velocity at the constriction and ν the kinematic viscosity and the cavitation number σ 2 p pv ρ v2 with ρ the liquid density p and pv the upstream and saturation vapor pressure at outlet conditions 20⁰c and 1atm respectively all values marked with the cav subscript are calculated from the measured pcav value representing the value at cavitation inception qcav vcav σcav recav for the σcav the velocity at the constriction is the cavitation inception velocity vcav 2 2 liquid line and luminol solution the liquid line of the experiment is shown in fig 1d the working liquid was a 1mm aqueous solution of 3 aminophthalhydrazide 97 luminol from sigma aldrich in 3 75mm naoh 11 4ph which was placed in a borosilicate glass bottle 1 serving as the liquid reservoir a small gear pump 2 propelled the liquid through a 1 diameter 1µm glass fiber filter and a 10µm nylon mesh 3 the safety valve 4 was present to prevent over pressurization of the system while a back pressure regulator controlled 5 the upstream pressure in the channel 6 the constriction in the micro channel presented the smallest cross section and therefore the main resistance to the flow meanwhile the downstream pressure was equal to 1atm as the liquid from 4 5 and 6 was collected in the open reservoir the pressure difference across the constriction driving pressure is therefore the difference between the set upstream and the downstream pressure the temperature of the liquid was monitored by a k type thermocouple and did not rise by more than 1⁰c during the experiments the mass flows at specific driving pressures were determined by a digital scale averaged at least over 10s for each upstream pressure condition 2 3 optical setup and radical detection the photon yield was acquired with an optical setup similar to previous publications podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a a r9789 photomultiplier tube pmt from emi was placed downstream of the constriction covering most of the downstream area of the channel to measure the cl emission an ortec vt120c preamplifier and ortec 935quad cfd discriminator were used for pre treatment of pulses created by the pmt with the ni usb 6003 daq counter used to acquire the final photon flux with the temporal resolution for the photon arrival times roughly 1µs the ½ pmt detector was 35mm from the cavitation region with the chemiluminescence passing through 10mm of plexiglass with the transmission coefficient of 0 66 at the luminol peak emission wavelength other coefficients were considered when determining the ros from the detected photons a the solid collection angle through the plexiglass to the pmt detector was 0 0552sr making the collection coefficient 0 0044 b the chemiluminescent reaction quantum yield at 0 0124 lee and seliger 1972 and c pmt quantum yield for the luminol emission spectrum 425nm peak at 0 15042 podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a therefore with our current optical setup each photon detected corresponds to 1 85 105 oxidation reactions taking place in the channel due to the ros formed by the hydrodynamic cavitation averaging the photon count per second can therefore be expressed as a number of species detected in attomoles per second amol s the chemical yield single photon detection requires black out conditions to allow for the detection of the weak cl signal the photon yields measurements were averaged over 60s with background and sonoluminescent signals if present subtracted the fast camera recording was taken with a photron fastcam sa z 2100k m 64gb and the as f vr micro nikkor 105mm camera objective at 100000fps in 0 05s clips and a 250ns shutter speed with backlight illumination provided by a led through a diffusion plate at the back side of the transparent plexiglass microchannel wall the average cloud length was determined by analyzing the standard deviation of the recorded series over several cloud shedding events as used in previous cavitation dynamics studies dular et al 2004 3 results 3 1 flow characterization and radical yield the channels geometries selected for these studies range from micro to near millimeter scale channel constriction dimensions w to h ratio are indicated in table 1 along with the channel naming protocol in the caption we can see the smaller series channels present different cavitation parameters mostly stemming from higher pcav values the transition to cavitating flow at the microscale is known to be metastable for pure liquids medrano et al 2012 2011 peles 2008 podbevsek et al 2018 we can observe metastability before cavitation inception in all three small channel series but the effect is lesser or non existent with the large series channels this can be seen in fig 2 a where we see the mass flow vs driving pressure relationship of all the channels examined there is an overlapping region of single and two phase flow for the small series channels where the liquid exhibits metastability due to the removal of the nucleation sites and the smooth walls of the microchannels as mentioned in the experimental setup section the rest of fig 2 addresses the relationship to the radical production in the channels at different flow conditions in fig 2b and c we see the reactive oxygen species yield amol s at different mass flow and driving pressure through the constriction respectively generally there is a trend of rising radical production with increasing constriction cross section the exception being the sc channel which shows radical below that of sb on the other hand fig 2d shows the radical production per processed liquid volume amol ml at different driving pressure when considering this parameter it is immediately obvious that the biggest channels are not necessarily optimal for radical production as was the case for the ros yield for the large series channels the inverse relationship is true as the la channel outperforms the wider lb and both outperform the widest lc channel moreover the latter lc shows only slightly higher amol ml values than the smallest ones sa and sb whose rates overlap throughout most of the pressure range the la and lb channels show uniform production at low driving pressure which only starts diverging above 4bar overall we can see that the two widest channels 1 5 aspect ratio in both large and small channel groups show the weakest radical yield per processed liquid volume for the particular group sc lc fig 3 shows the radical production with different flow parameters and dimensionless cavitation intensity markers linear progressions are shown similar to previous studies on smaller micro diaphragm type channels podbevšek et al 2021a the first graph shows the radical yield as a function of hydraulic power of the flow through the constriction most channels follow a similar slope with increasing driving pressure with slightly higher k values shown for la and slightly lower for sc channel furthermore the sa and sb slopes seem to overlap particularly well above 0 25w hydraulic power values on fig 3b the auxiliary graph shows the radical yield per processed liquid volume as a function of the dimensionless cavitation number σ a value often used to characterize cavitation intensity as it decreases indicating increased cavitation activity we see a gradual increase of the ros yield per treated liquid volume two distinct group are formed one for the small and one for the large series channels for the σ normalized to the channels σcav inception value σcav σ we see a uniform roughly linear trend between all channels with the slope ranging from 8 3 to 11 4 amol ml with the exception of sb equaling to roughly double the value the chemical yield at different q qcav values is presented in fig 3c where we observe the smaller sa and sb channels production overlapping whereas values for the rest of the channels vary here the tendency for the higher metastability of the smaller channel series seem to dominate over the high radical yield of the large channel group as the decreasing k values with increasing channel size seem to indicate the linear trends observed for the radical production amol s and amol ml for different flow parameters indicates a common mechanism is at play for all the channels in the study to explain this we examined the cavitation structures formed in the channels and their dynamics 3 2 cavitation structure dynamics and photon arrival times analysis fig 4 and fig 5 show the typical cloud shedding event in the small and large channel series respectively the process usually starts with the attached cavity forming just downstream of the constriction a vaporous void at the constriction eventually starts to shed individual cavitation bubbles forming a cavitation stream as best seen on fig 4 this stream grows further down the divergent part of the micro venturi channel until the flow recirculates forming a vortex filled with cavitation bubbles this is the beginning of the cavitation cloud which will grow downstream and eventually shed off at that point the cavitation stream will retreat upstream towards the constriction restarting the process while shed cloud collapses independently generally the dominant feature of hydrodynamic cavitation at this scale is the relatively long lived cloud shedding event while the less obvious cavitation stream itself is composed of many individual bubble collapses at much shorter timescales fig 4 shows a typical cloud shedding event in the smaller series channels where kelvin helmholtz instabilities can appear on the vapor cavity near the constriction as was recently reported in podbevšek et al 2021b and were shown to be linked to the cloud shedding event at the microscale cloud shedding event typical for large scale channels group is shown in fig 5 where the vaporous cavity at the mouth of the channel is seen more clearly the cavity can momentarily disappear at 2 5ms and reform at 3ms a much more distinct and unified vaporous structure surrounded by a small cavitation bubble stream appears compared to the cavitation cloud in the small series channels which is composed only of small bubbles when the cavitation cloud reaches the end of the divergent part of the channel the cavity collapses and the cavitation stream starts retreating downstream the constriction as the cloud sheds off 5 85ms the cloud collapse ensues after the process restarts and a new cloud starts to grow 6 5 to 7 25ms during most of the cloud shedding event the small bubbles making up the cavitation stream continuously grow and collapse in the cavitation stream throughout the channel the cavitation stream mechanism seems to diminish or momentarily disappears only during the retreating phase as the cloud sheds a time resolved analysis of the photon arrival times was also performed shown on fig 6 with the red marks indicating individual photon arrival events on the same figure we see the normalized average pixel value of an area near the constriction where the black area is indicative of the cavitation stream disappearing from the channel the periodic cloud shedding is captured this way as the background white 1 pixel value is acquired only when the cavitation stream retreats back to the constriction indicating no cavitation bubbles were present the two separate non synchronized recordings show typical periodical behavior in the lb channel at 8bar driving pressure for the chemiluminescent signal and cavitation shedding this relationship is not always so distinctly visible for all channels and flow conditions as an inherently low radical production might not produce a sufficient number of reactions photons to make the gap in the flow visible on the radical production timeline this could be described as chemiluminescence under sampling and effects mostly the smaller channel group in our study however notably the observed photons are not observed in bursts corresponding to the cavitation cloud shedding frequencies nor do they show an exponential decay trend which might be expected from instantaneous energetic collapse events forming large amounts of ros in fact the radical production is often seen increasing up until the cloud separation phase it is clear the radicals are being produced throughout the cavitation cloud growth not being confined to the cavitation cloud collapse event moreover the average period 8 8ms 1 99ms and the average gap time of 3 04ms 0 64ms for the photon arrival times is in agreement to the gap 2 5ms 0 68ms and the period 9 17 1 06ms found from the image analysis indicating that when the cavitation stream retreats the radical production in the flow stops a more careful examination of the cloud shedding frequency in the different channel geometries can be found in fig 7 the full symbols represent full cavitation cloud shedding mechanism while the empty symbols are the regimes where developed cavitation is present with partial or transitory cloud shedding all the channels show faster cloud shedding at lower re numbers lower driving pressure these typically level off for the large channel series while they continually drop for the smaller channels the small channel group tends to form distinctive cavitation clouds when the frequency approaches 600hz while for the large channel group the frequency is around 300hz channel sc shows the transition at 9 bar 780hz and is fully shedding at 10bar 610hz while for the sb and sa channels the transition is at 7 640hz and 8 bar 620hz respectively the larger series channels all show partial shedding at 2 bar with frequencies between 360 to 500hz and fully shedding at 3bar with frequencies around 300hz however no distinct discontinuities in the radical production rates are observed for any of the channels at the values where the cloud shedding frequencies change abruptly which might indicate that the increased cloud shedding frequencies would be producing more oxidation events in fact no obvious correlation is observed between the rate of cloud collapse events which are increased at lower driving pressures and the ros amol s or amol ml yields which increase with increasing driving pressure for the channels used in our study only the height and the width of the channel are varied while the rest of the geometry is uniform for all channels in the small series channels the cloud shedding event is taking place entirely within the divergent part of the micro venturi however for the large channel series the shed clouds can leave the divergent region of the channel at higher driving pressure in fig 8 the standard deviation analysis of the recorded series shows the downstream cloud shedding process in the large channel series taken over 50ms at 100kfps corresponding to at least 5 cloud shedding events per channel at a specific driving pressure condition the white areas show the area and the path of the cavitation cloud in each channel while the weak streak shows the path of residual bubble runoff following the collapse we can clearly see the la channel s linear progression of the average cloud path while for the other two channels there is a sharp variation to the linear advance at 5 and 6 bar for lc and lb respectively this corresponds to the end of the divergent part of the micro venturi where the sharp increase in the channel cross section will tend to induce the cavitation cloud collapse for any vapor structures that reach this region fig 9 shows the cavitation cloud length at different driving pressures with the dashed line indicating the approximated end of the divergent part of the channel the evolution of the average cloud length can be observed as the slopes at or after the dashed line are significantly diminished 4 discussion 4 1 microchannel radical production the existence of distinct metastable behavior in smaller channels shown in fig 2a indicates that the smooth surfaces of the laser cut stainless steel sheets and the plexiglass walls as well as the filtration of the liquid do not contribute to the nucleation and help water retain its tensile strength demonstrated by the resistance to the phase transition this also manifests itself as a difference between cavitation inception and desinence which is often reported in publications studying microscale hc ayela et al 2017 2013 medrano et al 2012 2011 we can see this behavior clearly in our small channel series and to a lesser extent on the larger channel as well in fig 2a mass flow curves at different driving pressures show the flow hysteresis for metastable small channel group the empty symbols represent the single phase flow and the full symbol cavitating flow the ros production of the channels either at higher mass flow or driving pressure seems to increase furthermore the ros production also increases with the increasing hydraulic diameter of the channel however when the ros production per treated liquid volume is considered the biggest channels are not the most efficient in this respect the la channel showed the best production in the study and sa and sb performing best for the small series group the latter two also approach the amol ml values of the largest channel tested in the series lc in fact the lowest amol ml yield in each channel group was shown from the widest channels sc and lc indicating that this aspect ratio is not a geometric optimum moreover it serves as an example of how this method facilitates optimization of flow and geometric parameters while providing a rapid and non intrusive ros production readout as well as allowing for a more in depth analysis of the chemical production in fig 3a when considering the ros production at varying hydraulic power of the flow we can observe similar linear trends appearing for all channels with the exception of channel sc which shows a lower slope k value to other channels again the least productive channels in each group seem to be the widest aspect ratio channels sc and lc as we can see other channels producing higher ros yields at a comparable hydraulic power value fig 3b considers the amol ml with dimensionless numbers used to evaluate the cavitation intensity σ and σcav σ rating the intensity of the cavitation process is generally difficult as depending on the phenomenon studied different parameters of the individual bubble and higher structures dynamics as well as physical parameters will be at play šarc et al 2017 the high speeds involved in our micro channels produce low σ indicating intense cavitation compared to macroscale numbers our data shows that when plotting the amol ml as a function of σ the two channel height groups also form two distinct groups producing similar amol ml values at similar flow conditions however more interestingly when scaling the σ value with its value at cavitation inception σcav σ the channels seem to adopt a unified linear progression with the exception of sb channel where the amol ml rate raises faster this could potentially be due to the fine geometry of the surface roughness at the constriction of the sb channel which can influence the measured pcav value for that particular channel as it seems to be somewhat higher than the sa and sc channels in fig 3c the ros yield per processed flow is examined at different q qcav values the small scale channels sa and sb amol ml production mostly overlaps while this no longer holds for the sc channel and even less so for the large group channels whose k values gradually decrease with increasing channel cross section interestingly the two smallest channels show the same linear trend observed in literature for a comparable cross section microdiaphragm channels dh 0 125mm and the k 74 7 amol ml podbevšek et al 2021a this indicates that a common fundamental mechanism linked to the flow at the microscale could be governing the radical production which lessens in relevance with increasing channel size 4 2 time resolved oxidation dynamics and the underlying cavitation structure as the radical production mechanism for cavitation is linked to the thermodynamic extremes at peak bubble collapse it is inevitable that any study on the chemical yield from hydrodynamic cavitation will have to consider the dynamics of the vaporous structures in the channel the simultaneous collapse of individual bubbles making up the cavitation cloud is a powerful and dominant structure dynamics event and it is natural to assume that the radical production could be predominantly linked to its implosion however our results point to the contrary as the photon arrival times are randomly distributed in the periods when the cavitation stream is present and therefore not linked to the cloud shedding frequency in fig 6 we can see the overlap of the photon arrival times and the cavitation stream presence obtained from image analysis it is important to stress that the chemiluminescence activity can only be recorded in blackout conditions therefore the two data sets cannot be acquired simultaneously however they do represent the typical periodical activity for the channels at the particular flow conditions from the figure it is clear that the photon arrival times follow the presence of the cavitation stream not a singular event like a cloud collapse a burst like generation of radicals as expected from a cavitation cloud collapse should yield an exponential decay type distribution of the photon arrival times in periodic sequences corresponding to the cavitation cloud shedding frequencies however what we observe is the cl reactions randomly distributed in time when the cavitation stream is present and periods of chemiluminescence inactivity during the periodic retreat of the stream notably we see the photon arrival gap and period match very well with the gap and period in the high speed recordings showing that the cl reactions are not taking place when the cavitation stream disappears from the flow this is strong evidence that the individual bubble collapses in the cavitation stream are in fact responsible for the ros production furthermore the radical production from cavitation cloud collapse would be correlated to the cloud shedding frequency which is not the case for our channels in fig 7 we see higher cloud shedding frequencies at lower driving pressure lower re values while the radical production for all channels rises linearly with increasing flow conditions we can also see that there is a transition from developed empty symbol to full filled symbol cavitation cloud shedding regime in the flow more clearly pronounced in the small channel series the small channel group tends to form distinctive cavitation clouds when the frequency approaches 600hz while for the large channel group the value is around 300hz above those frequencies the cloud will not fully form and will often just manifest as a cavitation stream burst for example sc channel only shows full cavitation shedding in the last 10bar measured point yet this transition is not observed as a deviation from the linear ros production trends in fig 8 as well as fig 9 the cavitation cloud evolution is shown limited by the channel design for the largest two channels yet this effect does not seem to affect the ros production we see that in channels lb and lc as the cavitation cloud path advance becomes limited the ros ml rates continue their linear trend as observed with other parameters this suggest that the radical production does not seem to be directly correlated to the void fraction represented by the average cloud presence in the channel as suggested in previous publications on micro diaphragm channels podbevsek et al 2018 it is most likely that the ros production is linked to the intensity or the relative time of the cavitation stream presence in the channel rather to simply the void fraction 5 conclusions a study on the radical production for hydrodynamic cavitation was conducted at the micro to the milli scale transition in venturi microchannels via luminol chemiluminescent reactions a general trend of increasing chemical yield was observed with increasing hydraulic diameter of the channel and with increasing driving pressure however in both channel series it was observed that when considering the chemical yield per treated volume of liquid the biggest channels did not always produce more indicating that an optimal geometry exists for the given flow parameters similar trendlines were observed between the channels of vastly different cross section when observed at different hydraulic power and other normalized cavitation parameters for the latter parameters the chemical production per processed volume for the smallest two microchannels seem to overlap as well as being in line with observations in literature for similar sized microdiaphragm channels furthermore this study also sheds light on the bubble dynamics mechanisms relevant at the microscale hydrodynamic cavitation the photon arrival time analysis show that the cavitation cloud collapse is not responsible for the radicals produced in the two phase flow this is corroborated by the lack of correlation between the cloud shedding frequency and the radical yield instead the cavitation bubble stream made up of individual smaller bubbles growing and collapsing was shown to be responsible for the chemical effects of the micro milli scale hydrodynamic cavitation indicating it could also be

phase transition known as cavitation occurs as a pressure decrease in the liquid drives the vapor bubble growth and subsequent collapse as the pressure normalizes this can occur in liquids that are subjected to acoustic excitation ultrasonic cavitation uc or in hydrodynamic systems where a constriction in the flow causes a low pressure region to form due to bernoulli s principle hydrodynamic cavitation hc it is an established principle in cavitation bubble dynamics that the compression of the content during the rapid bubble collapse leads to high temperatures and pressures inside the bubble which can lead to plasma formation luminescence and exotic chemical species production including free radical and other highly reactive species suslick 1997 these species form due to the extreme thermodynamic conditions during peak collapse where homolytic splitting of water takes place and are thought to be critical in cavitation based advanced oxidizing processes wood et al 2017

coupled with other advanced oxidation processes to achieve synergetic effects which can reduce the cost of such processes and make its use more feasible fedorov et al 2022 gągol et al 2020 however such treatment can be accompanied with unwanted nitration side reactions with toxic products that should be mitigated when the mineralization process is not complete rayaroth et al 2022 the chemical effects of cavitation are well known in uc suslick 1989 but have only in recent years started to be explored for hc gągol et al 2018 generally uc and hc have very different bubble dynamics as the former is based on periodic excitation while the latter is excited by a single low pressure pulse scaling down from macro to micro scale is expected to produce a more efficient bubble collapse as smaller bubble sizes should due to higher laplace pressure lead to better sphericity retention during the collapse phase as it can better resist the deformation due to pressure gradients in the flow and should therefore reach higher thermodynamic extremes in the bubble core at peak bubble collapse furthermore the bubble growth timescale at around 20µs can approach the single period of low frequency ultrasonic cavitation as was found in a recent study podbevšek et al 2021a hydrodynamic cavitation at the microscale is only beginning to be explored and offers a fundamental view into the hc phenomenon moreover microfluidic systems enable us to minimize the quantity of the liquids used crucial when studying minute quantities of toxic or exotic liquids as well as offering easy coupling with optical probing techniques ayela et al 2013 kim et al 2017 in such systems the liquids flowing through micro scale constrictions often have to be filtered to prevent clogging which can also remove the nuclei from the liquids allowing for liquid metastability often manifested as the delay in cavitation inception despite the advantages only a few groups use microfluidics to study the cavitation phenomenon aghdam et al 2019 ayela et al 2017 2013 cole et al 2006 gevari et al 2019 ghorbani 2021 ghorbani et al 2018b 2018c 2018a 2017b 2017a gothsch et al 2015 hosseinpour shafaghi et al 2021 medrano et al 2012 2011 mishra and peles 2006 2005a 2005b mishra and peles 2006 2005 mishra and peles 2004 mossaz et al 2017 nayebzadeh et al 2018 peles and schneider 2006 perrin et al 2021 podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a 2021b qiu et al 2019 2017 rokhsar talabazar et al 2021 rooze et al 2012 schneider et al 2007 singh and peles 2009 stieger et al 2017 cavitation cloud shedding is a typical and dominating event occurring in hydrodynamic cavitation often observed in convergent divergent and venturi channels at the macroscale typically these cavitation cloud structures grow until they shed off in a periodic manner usually with well defined shedding frequencies this can lead to a powerful and coordinated collapse of the main vapor cloud structure and the rest of the vapor bubbles in the channel due to the shockwave triggered by the main cloud collapse this simultaneous energetic event has been known to induce erosion noise and other phenomena in hydrodynamic cavitating flow dular et al 2006 there are several studies focusing on cavitation based radical production and waste water treatment usually aimed at specific pollutants typically requiring the analysis of the degradation product or trapping agents observing the degradation of p nitrol kalumuck and chahine 2000 rhodamine b mishra and gogate 2010 wang et al 2009 btex benzene toluene ethylbenzene xylene braeutigam et al 2009 fedorov et al 2021 2020 benzene to phenol batoeva et al 2011 and the weissler reaction tri iodide oxidation gogate et al 2001 were all used to assess the oxidative potential of hc the latter was later shown to degrade even without the presence of cavitation possibly due to temperature increase or copper induces surface catalytic reactions morison and hutchinson 2009 terephthalic gielen et al 2016 and salicylic acid dosimetry arrojo et al 2007 arrojo and benito 2008 is also used for hydroxyl radical specific analysis but the latter has recently been shown to influence the surface tension in the liquid and thus effecting cavitation bubble dynamics zupanc et al 2020 so care must be taken in the interpretation of the results however the chemiluminescent cl reactions of luminol with radical species has been used to study radical production from ultrasonic fernandez rivas et al 2012 hatanaka et al 2002 mcmurray and wilson 1999 price et al 2010 renaudin et al 1994 rooze et al 2013 son et al 2020 yin et al 2014 and hydrodynamic cavitation perrin et al 2021 podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a schlender et al 2016 recently an in situ quantitative method based on single photon counting of luminol chemiluminescent reactions has been developed podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a which dramatically decreases the analysis time as the radical production is obtained from the detected photons without the need for time consuming sampling and chemical analysis the technique allows us to study in situ production of radicals in the channel in a non invasive manner this is important as the two phase hydrodynamic flows tend to be very sensitive to perturbations especially at the microscale in this article we study the scaling effect on primary hydroxyl radical production along with secondary recombinant reactive oxygen species ros with potential to oxidize luminol hereafter referred to as ros in micro to mill scale convergent divergent channels by quantifying luminol chemiluminescent reactions through single photon counting the ros yield was examined for different flow parameters in each of the six microchannels of varying geometries the cavitation cloud shedding event a typical periodic cavitation structure growth and collapse is present in most of the 0 10bar driving pressure range examined in this study by monitoring the photon arrival times and the vaporous structure dynamics we can uncover the relevant mechanism for radical production in microscale hydrodynamic cavitation reactors 2 material and methods 2 1 microfluidic channel geometry and flow parameters a series of microchannels were laser cut from 150 and 450 µm thick aisi 316l stainless steel sheets which determines the height h of the channel one side of the geometry is straight while the other forms a convergent divergent 18⁰ 10⁰ slope of the micro channel as seen on the electron microscope image of the constriction on fig 1 a b for the small and the large channel series respectively a symmetric channel design with both sides angled was initially considered however such channels showed various different cavitation regimes at a particular driving pressure similar to observations in certain micro diaphragms used in podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a which tend to stochastically interchange during measurement this design was eventually abandoned as it proved difficult to work with due to unstable flow conditions three constriction widths w 0 5h h and 1 5h for each channel height group with about 27mm from constriction to the end of the divergent part of channel the plate was placed between two acrylic glass plates together forming the microchannel assembly like the setup used in podbevšek et al 2021b when observing cavitation at the microscale a delay in cavitation inception is often observed due to the liquid metastability caused by the lack of nucleation sites medrano et al 2011 podbevsek et al 2018 for our channels the smaller 150µm heights channel group small series channels metastable flow could be easily observed while in the 450µm height channels large series channels the metastability was more subtle as nucleation is a stochastic process there is a certain probability that the liquid will cavitate at a given driving pressure pcav the pcav was measured for each channel by increasing the pressure in 0 1bar increments and allowing 10s for metastable flow to jump to cavitating flow if thermodynamically favorable this was averaged over 10 rounds with the standard deviation and measurement uncertainty amounting to less than 0 1bar for most channels the different dimensionless numbers used in the study are the hydraulic diameter dh 4a γ where γ is the perimeter of the channel constriction and a the cross sectional area the reynolds number re v dh ν v being the velocity at the constriction and ν the kinematic viscosity and the cavitation number σ 2 p pv ρ v2 with ρ the liquid density p and pv the upstream and saturation vapor pressure at outlet conditions 20⁰c and 1atm respectively all values marked with the cav subscript are calculated from the measured pcav value representing the value at cavitation inception qcav vcav σcav recav for the σcav the velocity at the constriction is the cavitation inception velocity vcav 2 2 liquid line and luminol solution the liquid line of the experiment is shown in fig 1d the working liquid was a 1mm aqueous solution of 3 aminophthalhydrazide 97 luminol from sigma aldrich in 3 75mm naoh 11 4ph which was placed in a borosilicate glass bottle 1 serving as the liquid reservoir a small gear pump 2 propelled the liquid through a 1 diameter 1µm glass fiber filter and a 10µm nylon mesh 3 the safety valve 4 was present to prevent over pressurization of the system while a back pressure regulator controlled 5 the upstream pressure in the channel 6 the constriction in the micro channel presented the smallest cross section and therefore the main resistance to the flow meanwhile the downstream pressure was equal to 1atm as the liquid from 4 5 and 6 was collected in the open reservoir the pressure difference across the constriction driving pressure is therefore the difference between the set upstream and the downstream pressure the temperature of the liquid was monitored by a k type thermocouple and did not rise by more than 1⁰c during the experiments the mass flows at specific driving pressures were determined by a digital scale averaged at least over 10s for each upstream pressure condition 2 3 optical setup and radical detection the photon yield was acquired with an optical setup similar to previous publications podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a a r9789 photomultiplier tube pmt from emi was placed downstream of the constriction covering most of the downstream area of the channel to measure the cl emission an ortec vt120c preamplifier and ortec 935quad cfd discriminator were used for pre treatment of pulses created by the pmt with the ni usb 6003 daq counter used to acquire the final photon flux with the temporal resolution for the photon arrival times roughly 1µs the ½ pmt detector was 35mm from the cavitation region with the chemiluminescence passing through 10mm of plexiglass with the transmission coefficient of 0 66 at the luminol peak emission wavelength other coefficients were considered when determining the ros from the detected photons a the solid collection angle through the plexiglass to the pmt detector was 0 0552sr making the collection coefficient 0 0044 b the chemiluminescent reaction quantum yield at 0 0124 lee and seliger 1972 and c pmt quantum yield for the luminol emission spectrum 425nm peak at 0 15042 podbevsek et al 2018 podbevšek et al 2021a therefore with our current optical setup each photon detected corresponds to 1 85 105 oxidation reactions taking place in the channel due to the ros formed by the hydrodynamic cavitation averaging the photon count per second can therefore be expressed as a number of species detected in attomoles per second amol s the chemical yield single photon detection requires black out conditions to allow for the detection of the weak cl signal the photon yields measurements were averaged over 60s with background and sonoluminescent signals if present subtracted the fast camera recording was taken with a photron fastcam sa z 2100k m 64gb and the as f vr micro nikkor 105mm camera objective at 100000fps in 0 05s clips and a 250ns shutter speed with backlight illumination provided by a led through a diffusion plate at the back side of the transparent plexiglass microchannel wall the average cloud length was determined by analyzing the standard deviation of the recorded series over several cloud shedding events as used in previous cavitation dynamics studies dular et al 2004 3 results 3 1 flow characterization and radical yield the channels geometries selected for these studies range from micro to near millimeter scale channel constriction dimensions w to h ratio are indicated in table 1 along with the channel naming protocol in the caption we can see the smaller series channels present different cavitation parameters mostly stemming from higher pcav values the transition to cavitating flow at the microscale is known to be metastable for pure liquids medrano et al 2012 2011 peles 2008 podbevsek et al 2018 we can observe metastability before cavitation inception in all three small channel series but the effect is lesser or non existent with the large series channels this can be seen in fig 2 a where we see the mass flow vs driving pressure relationship of all the channels examined there is an overlapping region of single and two phase flow for the small series channels where the liquid exhibits metastability due to the removal of the nucleation sites and the smooth walls of the microchannels as mentioned in the experimental setup section the rest of fig 2 addresses the relationship to the radical production in the channels at different flow conditions in fig 2b and c we see the reactive oxygen species yield amol s at different mass flow and driving pressure through the constriction respectively generally there is a trend of rising radical production with increasing constriction cross section the exception being the sc channel which shows radical below that of sb on the other hand fig 2d shows the radical production per processed liquid volume amol ml at different driving pressure when considering this parameter it is immediately obvious that the biggest channels are not necessarily optimal for radical production as was the case for the ros yield for the large series channels the inverse relationship is true as the la channel outperforms the wider lb and both outperform the widest lc channel moreover the latter lc shows only slightly higher amol ml values than the smallest ones sa and sb whose rates overlap throughout most of the pressure range the la and lb channels show uniform production at low driving pressure which only starts diverging above 4bar overall we can see that the two widest channels 1 5 aspect ratio in both large and small channel groups show the weakest radical yield per processed liquid volume for the particular group sc lc fig 3 shows the radical production with different flow parameters and dimensionless cavitation intensity markers linear progressions are shown similar to previous studies on smaller micro diaphragm type channels podbevšek et al 2021a the first graph shows the radical yield as a function of hydraulic power of the flow through the constriction most channels follow a similar slope with increasing driving pressure with slightly higher k values shown for la and slightly lower for sc channel furthermore the sa and sb slopes seem to overlap particularly well above 0 25w hydraulic power values on fig 3b the auxiliary graph shows the radical yield per processed liquid volume as a function of the dimensionless cavitation number σ a value often used to characterize cavitation intensity as it decreases indicating increased cavitation activity we see a gradual increase of the ros yield per treated liquid volume two distinct group are formed one for the small and one for the large series channels for the σ normalized to the channels σcav inception value σcav σ we see a uniform roughly linear trend between all channels with the slope ranging from 8 3 to 11 4 amol ml with the exception of sb equaling to roughly double the value the chemical yield at different q qcav values is presented in fig 3c where we observe the smaller sa and sb channels production overlapping whereas values for the rest of the channels vary here the tendency for the higher metastability of the smaller channel series seem to dominate over the high radical yield of the large channel group as the decreasing k values with increasing channel size seem to indicate the linear trends observed for the radical production amol s and amol ml for different flow parameters indicates a common mechanism is at play for all the channels in the study to explain this we examined the cavitation structures formed in the channels and their dynamics 3 2 cavitation structure dynamics and photon arrival times analysis fig 4 and fig 5 show the typical cloud shedding event in the small and large channel series respectively the process usually starts with the attached cavity forming just downstream of the constriction a vaporous void at the constriction eventually starts to shed individual cavitation bubbles forming a cavitation stream as best seen on fig 4 this stream grows further down the divergent part of the micro venturi channel until the flow recirculates forming a vortex filled with cavitation bubbles this is the beginning of the cavitation cloud which will grow downstream and eventually shed off at that point the cavitation stream will retreat upstream towards the constriction restarting the process while shed cloud collapses independently generally the dominant feature of hydrodynamic cavitation at this scale is the relatively long lived cloud shedding event while the less obvious cavitation stream itself is composed of many individual bubble collapses at much shorter timescales fig 4 shows a typical cloud shedding event in the smaller series channels where kelvin helmholtz instabilities can appear on the vapor cavity near the constriction as was recently reported in podbevšek et al 2021b and were shown to be linked to the cloud shedding event at the microscale cloud shedding event typical for large scale channels group is shown in fig 5 where the vaporous cavity at the mouth of the channel is seen more clearly the cavity can momentarily disappear at 2 5ms and reform at 3ms a much more distinct and unified vaporous structure surrounded by a small cavitation bubble stream appears compared to the cavitation cloud in the small series channels which is composed only of small bubbles when the cavitation cloud reaches the end of the divergent part of the channel the cavity collapses and the cavitation stream starts retreating downstream the constriction as the cloud sheds off 5 85ms the cloud collapse ensues after the process restarts and a new cloud starts to grow 6 5 to 7 25ms during most of the cloud shedding event the small bubbles making up the cavitation stream continuously grow and collapse in the cavitation stream throughout the channel the cavitation stream mechanism seems to diminish or momentarily disappears only during the retreating phase as the cloud sheds a time resolved analysis of the photon arrival times was also performed shown on fig 6 with the red marks indicating individual photon arrival events on the same figure we see the normalized average pixel value of an area near the constriction where the black area is indicative of the cavitation stream disappearing from the channel the periodic cloud shedding is captured this way as the background white 1 pixel value is acquired only when the cavitation stream retreats back to the constriction indicating no cavitation bubbles were present the two separate non synchronized recordings show typical periodical behavior in the lb channel at 8bar driving pressure for the chemiluminescent signal and cavitation shedding this relationship is not always so distinctly visible for all channels and flow conditions as an inherently low radical production might not produce a sufficient number of reactions photons to make the gap in the flow visible on the radical production timeline this could be described as chemiluminescence under sampling and effects mostly the smaller channel group in our study however notably the observed photons are not observed in bursts corresponding to the cavitation cloud shedding frequencies nor do they show an exponential decay trend which might be expected from instantaneous energetic collapse events forming large amounts of ros in fact the radical production is often seen increasing up until the cloud separation phase it is clear the radicals are being produced throughout the cavitation cloud growth not being confined to the cavitation cloud collapse event moreover the average period 8 8ms 1 99ms and the average gap time of 3 04ms 0 64ms for the photon arrival times is in agreement to the gap 2 5ms 0 68ms and the period 9 17 1 06ms found from the image analysis indicating that when the cavitation stream retreats the radical production in the flow stops a more careful examination of the cloud shedding frequency in the different channel geometries can be found in fig 7 the full symbols represent full cavitation cloud shedding mechanism while the empty symbols are the regimes where developed cavitation is present with partial or transitory cloud shedding all the channels show faster cloud shedding at lower re numbers lower driving pressure these typically level off for the large channel series while they continually drop for the smaller channels the small channel group tends to form distinctive cavitation clouds when the frequency approaches 600hz while for the large channel group the frequency is around 300hz channel sc shows the transition at 9 bar 780hz and is fully shedding at 10bar 610hz while for the sb and sa channels the transition is at 7 640hz and 8 bar 620hz respectively the larger series channels all show partial shedding at 2 bar with frequencies between 360 to 500hz and fully shedding at 3bar with frequencies around 300hz however no distinct discontinuities in the radical production rates are observed for any of the channels at the values where the cloud shedding frequencies change abruptly which might indicate that the increased cloud shedding frequencies would be producing more oxidation events in fact no obvious correlation is observed between the rate of cloud collapse events which are increased at lower driving pressures and the ros amol s or amol ml yields which increase with increasing driving pressure for the channels used in our study only the height and the width of the channel are varied while the rest of the geometry is uniform for all channels in the small series channels the cloud shedding event is taking place entirely within the divergent part of the micro venturi however for the large channel series the shed clouds can leave the divergent region of the channel at higher driving pressure in fig 8 the standard deviation analysis of the recorded series shows the downstream cloud shedding process in the large channel series taken over 50ms at 100kfps corresponding to at least 5 cloud shedding events per channel at a specific driving pressure condition the white areas show the area and the path of the cavitation cloud in each channel while the weak streak shows the path of residual bubble runoff following the collapse we can clearly see the la channel s linear progression of the average cloud path while for the other two channels there is a sharp variation to the linear advance at 5 and 6 bar for lc and lb respectively this corresponds to the end of the divergent part of the micro venturi where the sharp increase in the channel cross section will tend to induce the cavitation cloud collapse for any vapor structures that reach this region fig 9 shows the cavitation cloud length at different driving pressures with the dashed line indicating the approximated end of the divergent part of the channel the evolution of the average cloud length can be observed as the slopes at or after the dashed line are significantly diminished 4 discussion 4 1 microchannel radical production the existence of distinct metastable behavior in smaller channels shown in fig 2a indicates that the smooth surfaces of the laser cut stainless steel sheets and the plexiglass walls as well as the filtration of the liquid do not contribute to the nucleation and help water retain its tensile strength demonstrated by the resistance to the phase transition this also manifests itself as a difference between cavitation inception and desinence which is often reported in publications studying microscale hc ayela et al 2017 2013 medrano et al 2012 2011 we can see this behavior clearly in our small channel series and to a lesser extent on the larger channel as well in fig 2a mass flow curves at different driving pressures show the flow hysteresis for metastable small channel group the empty symbols represent the single phase flow and the full symbol cavitating flow the ros production of the channels either at higher mass flow or driving pressure seems to increase furthermore the ros production also increases with the increasing hydraulic diameter of the channel however when the ros production per treated liquid volume is considered the biggest channels are not the most efficient in this respect the la channel showed the best production in the study and sa and sb performing best for the small series group the latter two also approach the amol ml values of the largest channel tested in the series lc in fact the lowest amol ml yield in each channel group was shown from the widest channels sc and lc indicating that this aspect ratio is not a geometric optimum moreover it serves as an example of how this method facilitates optimization of flow and geometric parameters while providing a rapid and non intrusive ros production readout as well as allowing for a more in depth analysis of the chemical production in fig 3a when considering the ros production at varying hydraulic power of the flow we can observe similar linear trends appearing for all channels with the exception of channel sc which shows a lower slope k value to other channels again the least productive channels in each group seem to be the widest aspect ratio channels sc and lc as we can see other channels producing higher ros yields at a comparable hydraulic power value fig 3b considers the amol ml with dimensionless numbers used to evaluate the cavitation intensity σ and σcav σ rating the intensity of the cavitation process is generally difficult as depending on the phenomenon studied different parameters of the individual bubble and higher structures dynamics as well as physical parameters will be at play šarc et al 2017 the high speeds involved in our micro channels produce low σ indicating intense cavitation compared to macroscale numbers our data shows that when plotting the amol ml as a function of σ the two channel height groups also form two distinct groups producing similar amol ml values at similar flow conditions however more interestingly when scaling the σ value with its value at cavitation inception σcav σ the channels seem to adopt a unified linear progression with the exception of sb channel where the amol ml rate raises faster this could potentially be due to the fine geometry of the surface roughness at the constriction of the sb channel which can influence the measured pcav value for that particular channel as it seems to be somewhat higher than the sa and sc channels in fig 3c the ros yield per processed flow is examined at different q qcav values the small scale channels sa and sb amol ml production mostly overlaps while this no longer holds for the sc channel and even less so for the large group channels whose k values gradually decrease with increasing channel cross section interestingly the two smallest channels show the same linear trend observed in literature for a comparable cross section microdiaphragm channels dh 0 125mm and the k 74 7 amol ml podbevšek et al 2021a this indicates that a common fundamental mechanism linked to the flow at the microscale could be governing the radical production which lessens in relevance with increasing channel size 4 2 time resolved oxidation dynamics and the underlying cavitation structure as the radical production mechanism for cavitation is linked to the thermodynamic extremes at peak bubble collapse it is inevitable that any study on the chemical yield from hydrodynamic cavitation will have to consider the dynamics of the vaporous structures in the channel the simultaneous collapse of individual bubbles making up the cavitation cloud is a powerful and dominant structure dynamics event and it is natural to assume that the radical production could be predominantly linked to its implosion however our results point to the contrary as the photon arrival times are randomly distributed in the periods when the cavitation stream is present and therefore not linked to the cloud shedding frequency in fig 6 we can see the overlap of the photon arrival times and the cavitation stream presence obtained from image analysis it is important to stress that the chemiluminescence activity can only be recorded in blackout conditions therefore the two data sets cannot be acquired simultaneously however they do represent the typical periodical activity for the channels at the particular flow conditions from the figure it is clear that the photon arrival times follow the presence of the cavitation stream not a singular event like a cloud collapse a burst like generation of radicals as expected from a cavitation cloud collapse should yield an exponential decay type distribution of the photon arrival times in periodic sequences corresponding to the cavitation cloud shedding frequencies however what we observe is the cl reactions randomly distributed in time when the cavitation stream is present and periods of chemiluminescence inactivity during the periodic retreat of the stream notably we see the photon arrival gap and period match very well with the gap and period in the high speed recordings showing that the cl reactions are not taking place when the cavitation stream disappears from the flow this is strong evidence that the individual bubble collapses in the cavitation stream are in fact responsible for the ros production furthermore the radical production from cavitation cloud collapse would be correlated to the cloud shedding frequency which is not the case for our channels in fig 7 we see higher cloud shedding frequencies at lower driving pressure lower re values while the radical production for all channels rises linearly with increasing flow conditions we can also see that there is a transition from developed empty symbol to full filled symbol cavitation cloud shedding regime in the flow more clearly pronounced in the small channel series the small channel group tends to form distinctive cavitation clouds when the frequency approaches 600hz while for the large channel group the value is around 300hz above those frequencies the cloud will not fully form and will often just manifest as a cavitation stream burst for example sc channel only shows full cavitation shedding in the last 10bar measured point yet this transition is not observed as a deviation from the linear ros production trends in fig 8 as well as fig 9 the cavitation cloud evolution is shown limited by the channel design for the largest two channels yet this effect does not seem to affect the ros production we see that in channels lb and lc as the cavitation cloud path advance becomes limited the ros ml rates continue their linear trend as observed with other parameters this suggest that the radical production does not seem to be directly correlated to the void fraction represented by the average cloud presence in the channel as suggested in previous publications on micro diaphragm channels podbevsek et al 2018 it is most likely that the ros production is linked to the intensity or the relative time of the cavitation stream presence in the channel rather to simply the void fraction 5 conclusions a study on the radical production for hydrodynamic cavitation was conducted at the micro to the milli scale transition in venturi microchannels via luminol chemiluminescent reactions a general trend of increasing chemical yield was observed with increasing hydraulic diameter of the channel and with increasing driving pressure however in both channel series it was observed that when considering the chemical yield per treated volume of liquid the biggest channels did not always produce more indicating that an optimal geometry exists for the given flow parameters similar trendlines were observed between the channels of vastly different cross section when observed at different hydraulic power and other normalized cavitation parameters for the latter parameters the chemical production per processed volume for the smallest two microchannels seem to overlap as well as being in line with observations in literature for similar sized microdiaphragm channels furthermore this study also sheds light on the bubble dynamics mechanisms relevant at the microscale hydrodynamic cavitation the photon arrival time analysis show that the cavitation cloud collapse is not responsible for the radicals produced in the two phase flow this is corroborated by the lack of correlation between the cloud shedding frequency and the radical yield instead the cavitation bubble stream made up of individual smaller bubbles growing and collapsing was shown to be responsible for the chemical effects of the micro milli scale hydrodynamic cavitation indicating it could also be

15821,semi quantitative gc ms and lc ms measurements of organic chemicals in groundwater and surface waters were used to assess the overall magnitude and contribution of the most important substances to calculated mixture hazard here we use gc ms and lc ms measurements taken from two separate national monitoring programs for groundwater and surface water in england in combination with chronic species sensitivity distribution ssd hc50 values published by posthuma et al 2019 environ toxicol chem 38 905 917 to calculate individual substance hazard quotients and mixture effects using a concentration addition approach the mixture analysis indicated that as anticipated there was an increased hazard from the presence of a cocktail of substances at sites compared to the hazard for any single chemical the magnitude of the difference between the hazard attributed to the most important chemical and the overall mixture effect however was not large thus the most toxic chemical contributed 20 of the calculated mixture effect in 99 of all measured groundwater and surface water samples on the basis of this analysis a 5 fold assessment factor placed on the risk identified for any single chemical would offer a high degree of in cases where implementation of a full mixture analysis was not possible this finding is consistent with previous work that has assessed chemical mixture effects within field monitoring programs and as such provides essential underpinning for future policy and management decisions on how to effectively and proportionately manage mixture risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gc ms lc ms chronic species sensitivity distribution concentration addition mixture assessment factor 1 introduction the focus of eco toxicological research and chemical management remains predominantly on single substances this does not take into account the fact that real exposures are overwhelmingly to mixtures that can vary in their nature complexity and composition over space and time the failure to routinely consider mixtures has been recognised as one of the key uncertainties in chemical and natural resource management van den brink et al 2018 recognising this gap there are increasing calls for risk assessments and regulation to routinely consider the health and environmental implications of mixture exposures within an evidence based framework backhaus and faust 2012 heys et al 2016 kienzler et al 2016 approaches for considering mixtures in risk assessment could range from full component based analysis and modelling to the inclusions of an additional assessment factor placed on a single substance hazard value or environmental quality standard a so called mixture assessment factor to account for co exposure effects hassold et al 2021 van gestel et al 2010 within component based mixture ecotoxicology the current dominants paradigm for predicting joint effects is based on two different concepts of additivity van gestel et al 2010 concentration addition for chemicals that act on the same biological target similar mode of action and independent action for chemicals that act sepraately on the same endpoint dissimilar mode of action these two models have been assessed for their capacity to predict the effects of carefully selected mixtures of chemicals with similar altenburger et al 2000 or dissimilar faust et al 2003 modes of action such studies have verified the predictive capability of these two models within their strict mechanistic contexts although their application to environmental mixtures can be challenging because toxic mechanisms and their relationship to species sensitivity are often poorly known spurgeon et al 2020 despite their limitations concentration addition and independent action have been routinely used to predict mixture risks in freshwaters baas et al 2016 finizio et al 2022 gustavsson and engwall 2006 silva and cerejeira 2015 vallotton and price 2016 and these predictions compared to ecological effects de zwart et al 2008 dezwart et al 2006 kortenkamp et al 2019 these assessments have found that observed effects are often consistent with mixture predictions although in some cases models underestimate effects such conservatism may be due to factors such as chemical chemical interactions leading to synergism the time scale of the exposures or combined stressor effects schipper et al 2014 stockdale et al 2010 overall however these verification studies indicate that mixture analysis can support a more realistic risk assessment than a traditional chemical by chemical approach to add to this body of knowledge we here conduct an analysis to assess the proportional contribution of organic chemicals measured in groundwater and surface water collected in england to predicted overall mixture hazard our study was not intended to conduct a definitive site specific risk assessment any such analysis would require an extended approach that includes the use of fully quantitative measurements and of regulatory relevant hazard values such as the substance specific hc5 or an approach that predicts the number of species that may be affected by an exposure such as the multi substance potentially affected fraction mspaf the assessment was based on a comparison of semi quantitative gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and liquid

the most robust hazard value to use for such an assessment the hazard quotients hqs calculated were then used in combination with an additive model to predict the mixture effect from this analysis some key trends relating to the presence of multiple chemicals in waters were calculated and visualised these included determining how mixtures increased the frequency of identified hazard compared to a single chemical assessment assessing the relationship between mixture complexity and overall mixture hazard and assessing the degree to which mixture hazard exceeds that for the most important single chemical the implications of these results for risk assessment are outlined including how they may inform on the magnitude of any future mixture assessment factor 2 materials and methods 2 1 environment agency groundwater and surface water monitoring data set the environment agency groundwater quality monitoring network in england comprises 2000 borehole well or spring locations these sites have been selected to be representative of the groundwater quality in that locality with obvious point sources of pollution excluded from the program approximately 10 800 samples were taken for gc ms analysis between 2009 and october 2019 and 800 samples for lc ms analysis between 2014 and october 2019 the samples for the surface water monitoring program have been collected from rivers lakes and ponds across england samples have been collected for a wide range of reasons including site assessment compliance monitoring operational monitoring and water resource management visited sites have been sampled at a range of frequencies including regular periodic and event driven sampling for specific requirements not design within the current project which merely aimed to incorporate all available data within the surface water program approximately 23 000 samples have been collected and analysed by gc ms and 2800 by lc ms all chemical analysis was conducted by the environment agency s accredited laboratory in star cross uk using broad target based semi quantitative screening methods that are described in detail in lapworth et al 2018 moreau et al 2019 and white et al 2019 a full list of analytes measured by the two methods across the full data set are provided in the supplementary information of spurgeon et al 2022 for brevity a summary of the full method used for the analysis is provided below the gc ms method used for all measurements uses a liquid liquid extraction method an internal standard d10 phenanthrene is added to each sample which is then extracted using dichloromethane 50 ml the solvent is removed and the aqueous layer acidified ph 1 2 extraction is then repeated on the acidified sample the extracts are combined and then evaporated slowly to avoid volatile compound loss under a nitrogen stream the extract is dried using anhydrous sodium sulphate prior to analysis the gc ms target based multi residue method measures almost all gc amenable pesticides and hundreds of other organic contaminants to detection limits as low as 0 01 μg l deconvolution reporting software is used for the mass spectral analysis over time the method has added further substances to the analytical suite and also lowered many detection limits within the full data set 491 analytes were found in one or more samples in groundwater and 515 in surface water the lc ms q tof method measures almost all lc amenable pesticides as well as many pharmaceutical and perfluorinated chemicals for sample analysis waters oasis hlb spe cartridges are conditioned with methanol and then ultra high purity uhp water the water sample is then loaded onto the cartridge which is then washed with uhp water and dried under nitrogen the column is eluted twice firstly with 0 1 formic acid in a 1 1 mix of methanol acetonitrile followed by dichloromethane the dichloromethane and methanol acetonitrile extracts are then successively evaporated under nitrogen and uhp water added for the analysis target compound identification is made by retention time accurate mass and isotope distributions estimates of concentration is based on quantitative ion response and the measurement of the internal standard quantification limits are compound specific and are typically between 0 001 0 1 μg l changes over time have added substances to the suite and lowered detection limits overall measurements have quantified 290 and 315 chemicals above the limit of detection in groundwaters and surface waters respectively 2 2 cas number assignment and excluded substances cas numbers were assigned to each measured substance any measured values for substances lacking a cas number or for which units were not provided were excluded from the analysis such values always comprised 5 of the total number of measured values two sulphur compounds s8 cas number 10 544 50 0 cyclooctasulphur and s6 cas number 13 798 23 7 hexathiane that were detected by gc ms were excluded from the assessment as neither is an organic chemical the steroids cholesterol and squalene were also excluded due to their potentially ubiquitous natural endogenous origin the range of substances included for measurement was 1144 from the combined number of gc ms and lc ms detected analytes this number excludes duplicate substances detected by both methods of this total number of determinands 684 and 769 were detected above the limit of detection in the groundwater or surface water samples by one or both methods 2 3 collection of hazard values hazard values relating to surface water ecological receptors were collected for all substances included in the two analytical suites the hazard values were used for both the surface water and groundwater data sets use for groundwater was considered relevant because i specific values were not available for the sub surface environment and ii groundwater resources will contribute to surface water flows hence values for surface water receptors are relevant the hazard values were taken from the larger set of hc50 values published by posthuma et al 2019 these authors derived these values from a set of species sensitivity distributions ssd generated from the available aquatic ecotoxicological data in a well structured and highly valuable assessment the hazardous concentration for 50 of species hc50 values from these ssds was selected above lower effect thresholds such as the hc5 because the hc50 is placed in the middle of the distribution and so is more robust than values sitting more within the distribution tail for site specific risk assessments the use of values with a higher protection goal such as the hc5 would provide a more precautionary approach 2 4 calculation of mixture risk the overall approach to mixture risk calculation is shown in fig 1 briefly concentrations of all of the substances present above the limit of detection in ground and surface water by gc ms and lc ms were compared to the chronic ssd hc50 for that substance if available to generate a set of hazard quotients measured concentration in groundwater or surface water chronic ssd hc50 value for all of the chemicals in every analysed sample to calculate the mixture risk two models were considered concentration addition and independent action concentration addition was selected rather than independent action for two reasons first of the two models concentration addition generally predicts slightly greater effects for a given mixture than independent action except when response curves are shallow hence the use of concentration addition is precautionary secondly concentration addition only requires a single hazard metric i e a chronic ssd hc50 to calculate contributions to the mixture effect rather than a full response relationship as is needed for independent action but which was not readily available for all substances considered here van gestel et al 2010 based on a concentration addition approach all detected chemicals with a chronic ssd hc50 could be included in the mixture analysis this equated to 725 of the 1144 analysed chemicals n b a full list of chemicals and extracted hc50 values can be found in the supplementary information of spurgeon et al 2022 concentration addition was implemented following the basic equation of altenburger et al 2000 a limitation of the use of concentration addition also applicable to independent action is that if there is no hazard value available for a chemical then that substance simply cannot be included within the mixture calculation this means mixture assessment for a given sample may frequently underestimate risk due to the presence of chemicals lacking a hazard value similarly chemicals that are not detected by the gc ms and lc ms scans e g trace metals are also not included hence while informative our overall approach cannot be taken as an exhaustive assessment of risk for any sample or site 3 results 3 1 calculation of mixture effects substance hqs were calculated for all chemicals present above the lod in a sample by comparing the measured concentration for that substance to its reported chronic ssd hc50 this analysis was conducted separately for all gc ms and lc ms analysed groundwater and surface water samples individual substance hqs were then summed using concentration addition to derive the mixture hazard quotient hereafter hqmix the distribution of hqmix values for all measured samples was then plotted from lowest to highest to allow the distribution of mixture risk to be visualised fig 2 in the groundwater gc ms data set individual substance hqs and calculated hqmix values indicate that as expected a greater number of sites have an hqmix value 1 than is the case for any single chemical the gc ms hqmix was 1 in 64 0 63 of the analysed groundwater samples fig 2a indicating that there were multiple samples in which gc ms measured chemicals would be predicted to impact in some way 50 of the species present based on the mixture exposure exceeding the calculated hazard value 50 of species for lc ms substances no site has an hqmix 1 however an hqmix of 0 1 was found for 89 of 878 sites 10 1 fig 2c this is greater than the number of sites showing this degree of mixture hazard for any single lc ms measured chemical the greater number of sites with hqmix values 1 or 0 1 in both the gc ms and lc ms measured chemicals in groundwater indicates additional cumulative hazard from mixtures above that for any single chemical in surface water there was also a greater number of sites with a chronic ssd hc50 hqmix 1 than sites with an hq 1 for any single chemical for the gc ms data a hqmix 1 is found in 876 samples 4 3 fig 2b although of these 572 samples were characterised by the presence of rotenone at piscicidal levels this high predicted risk for this chemical is based on an hc50 value that comes from a high quality ssd derived from measured data posthuma et al 2019 the presence of high rotenone levels is associated with samples taken for analysis to confirm concentrations used for invasive fish species control the detection of high hazard at these rotenone treated sites was useful as it confirm method capacity to identify sites with high chemical associated risk although such sites cannot be considered representative of wider surface water chemical status the remaining 304 samples 1 4 that had an hqmix 1 all contained multiple gc ms detected chemicals but not rotenone that contributed to the overall mixture effect in the surface water lc ms measurement data set a value of hqmix 1 is found in a single sample 0 03 fig 2d whereas no single chemical has a chronic ssd hc50 hq 1 a greater number of sites with an hqmix 0 1 are also found compared to the values of hq 1 for any single substance calculation of hqmix for both measurement methods and sample types indicates that mixture assessment identifies a greater scale of potential impacts due to the presence of multiple chemicals than for any single chemical the identification of a greater number of sites with hqmix 1 by gc ms compared to lc ms may simply be the product of the greater number of samples analysed by gc ms 16 000 for groundwater 22 000 for surface water compared to lc ms 800 for groundwater 2200 for surface water this greater number gives an order of magnitude or more potential to find locally high concentrations of one or more chemicals giving an hqmix 1 alternatively substances detected by gc ms may be more likely to exceed hazard thresholds because of their specific physicochemical characteristics further work would be needed to tease apart the relevance of both of these factors and their role in determining mixture risk 3 2 contribution of the most important single chemical to the mixture effect to assess the importance of the most toxic chemical to mixture risk the cumulative distribution of the proportional contribution of the most important individual substance hq to hqmix was calculated for all groundwater and surface water gc ms and lc ms sample measurements fig 3 if hqmix is equal to the hq of the most important toxic chemical hereafter hqmax then that chemical contributes all of the mixture effect in such cases the evaluation effectively is a single substance assessment and no longer needs to consider mixtures in those cases where hqmax 0 5 then the most toxic substance contributes half of the mixture effect and where hqmax 0 2 then one fifth of the total mixture effect is due to the most important chemical for gc ms chemicals in groundwater the most important chemical hqmax contributes to 20 of hqmix in 2 of 9365 0 02 samples and 50 of hqmix in 516 samples 5 5 fig 3a this compares to 6013 62 of samples where hqmax is between 50 and 100 of hqmix indicating the most risky substance contributes half of the mixture effect and 3034 samples 32 4 where hqmax 1 indicating that only a single substance contributes for gc ms detected chemicals in surface water there are 9 of 19 911 0 05 of samples where hqmax contributes 20 of hqmix and 1984 10 of samples where hqmax is 50 of hqmix fig 3c this compares to 15 241 sample 76 5 where hqmax is 50 but less 100 of hqmix and 2677 13 4 sites where hqmax 1 indicating only a single chemical contribution for lc ms detected chemicals in groundwater hqmax always contributes 20 to hqmix there are 55 of 818 sites 7 2 when hqmax 0 5 indicating that the most toxic chemical contributes less than 50 to the mixture effect fig 3b this compares to 645 sites 78 9 where hqmax is 50 of hqmix and only a single sample where hqmax 1 indicating the contribution of a single substance although 433 53 2 of all samples have an hqmax 90 of hqmix indicating that one chemical contributes a large proportion of the mixture effect for the lc ms analytes in surface water 32 samples 1 2 have an hqmax that contributes 20 to hqmix and there are 1010 samples 38 2 where the most toxic chemical contributes 50 of hqmix fig 3d this compares to 1602 60 6 where hqmax is 50 but less 100 of hqmix there is also a single sample where hqmax 1 indicating the presence of a single substance although 159 6 have an hqmax 90 of hqmix indicating the dominance of a single chemical 3 3 relationship of hqmix with the number of chemicals detected in the sample mixture hqmix may be expected to increase as mixture complexity increases given that more chemicals are present at detectable concentrations to contribute to the overall effect to test this hypothesis chronic ssd hc50 calculated values of hqmix were plotted against the number of chemicals present in the sample an increase in the number of chemicals detected was weakly associated with a higher value of hqmix fig 4 a d there are however numerous samples at which high values of hqmix are found even when the number of chemicals contributing is relatively low 5 especially in the gc ms data set as mixture complexity increases the number of samples with low hqmix values tends to reduce such that for mixtures of 10 substances relatively low values of hqmix are rarely found fig 4a d this pattern of a reduced number of low hqmix sites at high complexity is consistent across measurement methods and sampled environments this suggest that as chemical number increases overall mixture effect tends to increase although some cases do still occur where multiple low levels are present compared to respective hc50s and a small mixture effect remains 3 4 number of chemicals detected and the contribution of the most toxic chemical hqmax to assess how the most toxic single chemical contribution changes with mixture complexity hqmax was plotted against the number of chemicals contributing to the mixture effect fig 5 a d even when there are relatively few chemicals present 3 there are still cases where the most important chemical contributes around 0 4 of hqmix these samples represent cases of substantial mixture effect at low mixture complexity as the number of substances in the mixture increases to 10 there is a trend for hqmax to decrease although this pattern is not strong indeed even when the mixture becomes quite complex 15 chemicals there still remains samples where the most important chemical still contributes 50 of hqmix in all data sets fig 5a d 4 discussion chemical mixture assessment is a complex task any mixture analysis by its nature will have specific assumptions and limitations this is the case with the approach adopted here the method was based on the use of concentration addition this model is particularly well suited for mixture assessments made using single value hazard thresholds because the mixture effects can be calculated without access to full concentration response relationship something needed for independent action but which is rarely available van gestel et al 2010 this means that the decision of model choice for risk assessment is primarily a pragmatic one based on data availability rather than any mechanistic considerations despite the practical benefits of using an approach based on concentration addition there are also some theoretical and practical issues with the use of this model that are relevant to the interpretation of outcomes the concentration addition model assumes that substances exert effects through a similar mode of action given the range of substances detected a common mechanism is rarely if ever likely to be applicable this means that assessment done using the concentration addition model may not accurately predict the true mixture effect mixture assessment using concentration addition may result in a more precautionary mixture effect prediction than use of independent action although previous studies have suggested that the absolute magnitude of this difference is often relatively small backhaus 2016 cedergreen et al 2008 concentration addition is generally accepted to result in a more conservative mixture effect prediction than the independent action model and so is well suited for initial screening and risk characterisation van gestel et al 2010 the assessment conducted with concentration addition here may mean that the magnitude of mixture effects compared to worst case single chemical may be overestimated compared to the true situation a further issue with a concentration addition approach is that the model assumes that all chemicals in the mixture act independently without interacting as a consequence synergistic or antagonistic effects are not accounted for there is a widely accepted potential for synergism or antagonism to occur in a small but potentially significant number of mixture cases belden et al 2007 cedergreen 2014 martin et al 2021 studies have shown that the effects of synergistic or antagonistic interactions can be cumulative cedergreen et al 2012 however probability also means that when mixture complexity rises the probability for counteracting synergistic or antagonistic interactions also increases as a result more complex mixtures may trend more to additivity than simpler mixtures in which a single synergistic or antagonistic interaction may dominate tian et al 2012 warne and hawker 1995 the mixture assessment was conducted by comparing the reported concentrations of a chemical detected with the chronic ssd hc50 value for that substance an obvious limitation of the mixture analysis is therefore that the assessment can only consider substances that are both detected above the limit of detection and also for which posthuma et al 2019 have reported a chronic ssd hc50 value only the case for 80 of detected chemicals the gc ms and lc ms methods used provided the potential to detect a wide range of different organic chemicals however not all organic chemicals that are potential pollutants are included in the analysis as a result some substances are missing from the assessment in addition to those present at concentrations below the analytical detection limit given that different suites of substances are detected by each method the outcome of the analysis is operationally defined by the diversity of chemicals included in the analytical suite hence each method only captures a snapshot of the potential mixture risk within each analysis certain classes of substances more amenable to detection by other methods are excluded thus the lc ms method measures many pesticide and pharmaceuticals but not many classical persistent organic pollutants pcbs pbdes pahs while for gc ms the opposite is the case a merger of hqs could potentially have been conducted for substances detected by both methods in cases where samples were taken at the same time and location however there are technical issues with such a merger for example differences in the detection limits between the analysis methods would result in the inclusion of a greater number of lc ms than gc ms chemicals this difference in the number of chemicals included due to method sensitivity would be important when considering specific aspects of the mixture effect such as how many substances contribute and any relationships between that number and the contribution of the most important single chemical further the different physicochemical properties of the substance in each of these target screens could accentuate any such differences even if analyses outcomes were combined this would still be an underestimation of total mixture effect since the target screen substance selection misses not only some organic chemicals but also the contribution of inorganic chemicals which are frequently highlighted as the substances most likely to present relative high risk in surface waters donnachie et al 2014 johnson et al 2017 a further limitation of the overall approach is the semi quantitative nature of the concentrations measurements made further substance calibrations would be needed and are underway to verify measurements made for specific substance groups of high interest e g pfas compounds to provide greater certainty on the analytical accuracy of the individual substance measurements although there are challenges for mixture analyses and interpretation using concentration addition the approach has an established history for pragmatic and conservative field based mixture assessment dezwart et al 2006 piliere et al 2014 schell et al 2018 schipper et al 2014 past mixture studies have used a range of metrics derived from single species studies e g the lc50 for daphnia sp as the hazard term for mixture assessment schell et al 2018 verro et al 2009 the approach here benefits from assessing mixture effects against a hazard value derived based on a wider set of toxicity information organised in a species sensitivity distribution rather than on a metric derived for a single species as such it provides a more holistic basis for assessing mixture effects at the ecosystem level chemicals are generally present in the environment as mixtures the results of the groundwater and surface water monitoring programs clearly illustrate the presence of multiple chemicals in both environments for example measurements by lc ms almost always showed the presence of 5 chemicals and in some samples up to 70 chemicals were found within the analysed samples see fig 4 only when the detection limits are relatively high as in the gc ms analysis is the ubiquitous presence of a cocktail of chemicals not seen however this is almost certainly due to the inability of this method to detect chemicals at low concentrations rather than a true absence of a complex chemical mixture at the sampled locations use of concentration addition to predict a combined hazard for the detected mixtures as hqmix indicated that as would be expected there was a greater hazard from mixtures than was the case for any single substance by comparing worst case single chemical and mixture effect predictions it is possible to comment on the scale of this additional mixture hazard compared to the worst case single chemical case backhaus 2016 drakvik et al 2020 for the gc ms and lc ms data sets assessment of the contribution of the most toxic chemical hqmax to the mixture effect hqmix indicated that in 50 of samples the presence of further chemicals beyond the most toxic substance causes a 2 fold increase in indicated hazard i e 50 of sites have an hqmax 50 of hqmix in only a small proportion of samples 1 5 does the presence of further chemicals results in a 5 fold increase in the predicted mixture hazard compared to that for the most toxic substance i e hqmax 20 of hqmix such information may be important if developing an assessment factor that could account for mixture effects as it represents the ratio between the most important compound and the total mixture hazard within the analysis the nature of the substances making the largest contribution to the mixture effect vary between analytical measurement methods and the sampled environments spurgeon et al 2022 conducted a worse case risk ranking of substances in both groundwater and surface water using the same set environmental measurement data this analysis indicated that a number of industrial e g pahs plastics associated chemicals and legacy pesticides were highly ranked in groundwater more personal care products and pharmaceuticals were highly ranked in surface waters and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl and current use pesticides were highly ranked in both compartments these classes of substance are similarly often major contributors to the mixture hazard predicted here for the groundwater and surface water samples the results from this analysis on the magnitude of difference between hqmax and hqmix is consistent with the conclusions of previous comparative single chemical and mixture effect studies for example backhaus and karlsson 2014 used a similar approach as used here to calculate mixture assessment factors for pharmaceuticals from their analysis these authors concluded that a maximum value of 4 3 was needed to scale from worst case single chemical to the additive mixture effect rorije et al 2022 also came to the conclusion that the most toxic chemical often contributed a substantial proportion of the overall mixture effect based on an analysis conducted for european fresh water ecosystems using the norman chemical monitoring database these authors were however reticent to define a value of the magnitude of any assessment factor that could be placed on the most important chemical to protect against mixture effects although further analysis was planned towards this objective the results found in these previous studies on the nature of proportionate contribution of chemicals to mixture effects are clearly mirrored in the current work thus there is only 1 of samples in which the most important chemical contributed 20 to the overall mixture effects the coalescence of the conclusions from these multiple studies suggests that a mixture assessment factor of five placed on the hq of the most important chemical could adequately protect for possible mixture effects as however the process needed to identify the most important chemical matches that used to identify the additive sum of mixture effects the actual mixture effect can also be equally readily calculated in monitoring studies such a mixture assessment can provide a more robust analysis that is neither over protective or more rarely under protective than considering only the individual chemicals detected at a given site 5 conclusions 1 hazard quotients were determined using chronic ssd hc50 values for 80 of the substances detected by semi quantitative gc ms and lc ms analysis of groundwater and surface water samples a concentration addition approach was used to calculate the mixture effect from the individual substance hq values 2 additional hazard compared to that for any single chemical was found for the calculated mixture effect although the magnitude of this additional risk was not always large 3 consistent patterns were present in all data sets thus the most toxic substance contributed 50 of the mixture effect in 99 of cases and greater mixture complexity was associated with increased mixture effect although only weakly so 4 the consistent finding that the most toxic chemical very often contributed most of the mixture effect suggests that a mixture assessment factor of five placed on the hq for the most important single substance would be sufficient to account for any mixture effects

15821,semi quantitative gc ms and lc ms measurements of organic chemicals in groundwater and surface waters were used to assess the overall magnitude and contribution of the most important substances to calculated mixture hazard here we use gc ms and lc ms measurements taken from two separate national monitoring programs for groundwater and surface water in england in combination with chronic species sensitivity distribution ssd hc50 values published by posthuma et al 2019 environ toxicol chem 38 905 917 to calculate individual substance hazard quotients and mixture effects using a concentration addition approach the mixture analysis indicated that as anticipated there was an increased hazard from the presence of a cocktail of substances at sites compared to the hazard for any single chemical the magnitude of the difference between the hazard attributed to the most important chemical and the overall mixture effect however was not large thus the most toxic chemical contributed 20 of the calculated mixture effect in 99 of all measured groundwater and surface water samples on the basis of this analysis a 5 fold assessment factor placed on the risk identified for any single chemical would offer a high degree of in cases where implementation of a full mixture analysis was not possible this finding is consistent with previous work that has assessed chemical mixture effects within field monitoring programs and as such provides essential underpinning for future policy and management decisions on how to effectively and proportionately manage mixture risks graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords gc ms lc ms chronic species sensitivity distribution concentration addition mixture assessment factor 1 introduction the focus of eco toxicological research and chemical management remains predominantly on single substances this does not take into account the fact that real exposures are overwhelmingly to mixtures that can vary in their nature complexity and composition over space and time the failure to routinely consider mixtures has been recognised as one of the key uncertainties in chemical and natural resource management van den brink et al 2018 recognising this gap there are increasing calls for risk assessments and regulation to routinely consider the health and environmental implications of mixture exposures within an evidence based framework backhaus and faust 2012 heys et al 2016 kienzler et al 2016 approaches for considering mixtures in risk assessment could range from full component based analysis and modelling to the inclusions of an additional assessment factor placed on a single substance hazard value or environmental quality standard a so called mixture assessment factor to account for co exposure effects hassold et al 2021 van gestel et al 2010 within component based mixture ecotoxicology the current dominants paradigm for predicting joint effects is based on two different concepts of additivity van gestel et al 2010 concentration addition for chemicals that act on the same biological target similar mode of action and independent action for chemicals that act sepraately on the same endpoint dissimilar mode of action these two models have been assessed for their capacity to predict the effects of carefully selected mixtures of chemicals with similar altenburger et al 2000 or dissimilar faust et al 2003 modes of action such studies have verified the predictive capability of these two models within their strict mechanistic contexts although their application to environmental mixtures can be challenging because toxic mechanisms and their relationship to species sensitivity are often poorly known spurgeon et al 2020 despite their limitations concentration addition and independent action have been routinely used to predict mixture risks in freshwaters baas et al 2016 finizio et al 2022 gustavsson and engwall 2006 silva and cerejeira 2015 vallotton and price 2016 and these predictions compared to ecological effects de zwart et al 2008 dezwart et al 2006 kortenkamp et al 2019 these assessments have found that observed effects are often consistent with mixture predictions although in some cases models underestimate effects such conservatism may be due to factors such as chemical chemical interactions leading to synergism the time scale of the exposures or combined stressor effects schipper et al 2014 stockdale et al 2010 overall however these verification studies indicate that mixture analysis can support a more realistic risk assessment than a traditional chemical by chemical approach to add to this body of knowledge we here conduct an analysis to assess the proportional contribution of organic chemicals measured in groundwater and surface water collected in england to predicted overall mixture hazard our study was not intended to conduct a definitive site specific risk assessment any such analysis would require an extended approach that includes the use of fully quantitative measurements and of regulatory relevant hazard values such as the substance specific hc5 or an approach that predicts the number of species that may be affected by an exposure such as the multi substance potentially affected fraction mspaf the assessment was based on a comparison of semi quantitative gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms measured chemical concentrations in samples to the ecological hazard value chronic ssd hc50 available for that chemical as published by posthuma et al 2019 as the most robust hazard value to use for such an assessment the hazard quotients hqs calculated were then used in combination with an additive model to predict the mixture effect from this analysis some key trends relating to the presence of multiple chemicals in waters were calculated and visualised these included determining how mixtures increased the frequency of identified hazard compared to a single chemical assessment assessing the relationship between mixture complexity and overall mixture hazard and assessing the degree to which mixture hazard exceeds that for the most important single chemical the implications of these results for risk assessment are outlined including how they may inform on the magnitude of any future mixture assessment factor 2 materials and methods 2 1 environment agency groundwater and surface water monitoring data set the environment agency groundwater quality monitoring network in england comprises 2000 borehole well or spring locations these sites have been selected to be representative of the groundwater quality in that locality with obvious point sources of pollution excluded from the program approximately 10 800 samples were taken for gc ms analysis between 2009 and october 2019 and 800 samples for lc ms analysis between 2014 and october 2019 the samples for the surface water monitoring program have been collected from rivers lakes and ponds across england samples have been collected for a wide range of reasons including site assessment compliance monitoring operational monitoring and water resource management visited sites have been sampled at a range of frequencies including regular periodic and event driven sampling for specific requirements not design within the current project which merely aimed to incorporate all available data within the surface water program approximately 23 000 samples have been collected and analysed by gc ms and 2800 by lc ms all chemical analysis was conducted by the environment agency s accredited laboratory in star cross uk using broad target based semi quantitative screening methods that are described in detail in lapworth et al 2018 moreau et al 2019 and white et al 2019 a full list of analytes measured by the two methods across the full data set are provided in the supplementary information of spurgeon et al 2022 for brevity a summary of the full method used for the analysis is provided below the gc ms method used for all measurements uses a liquid liquid extraction method an internal standard d10 phenanthrene is added to each sample which is then extracted using dichloromethane 50 ml the solvent is removed and the aqueous layer acidified ph 1 2 extraction is then repeated on the acidified sample the extracts are combined and then evaporated slowly to avoid volatile compound loss under a nitrogen stream the extract is dried using anhydrous sodium sulphate prior to analysis the gc ms target based multi residue method measures almost all gc amenable pesticides and hundreds of other organic contaminants to detection limits as low as 0 01 μg l deconvolution reporting software is used for the mass spectral analysis over time the method has added further substances to the analytical suite and also lowered many detection limits within the full data set 491 analytes were found in one or more samples in groundwater and 515 in surface water the lc ms q tof method measures almost all lc amenable pesticides as well as many pharmaceutical and perfluorinated chemicals for sample analysis waters oasis hlb spe cartridges are conditioned with methanol and then ultra high purity uhp water the water sample is then loaded onto the cartridge which is then washed with uhp water and dried under nitrogen the column is eluted twice firstly with 0 1 formic acid in a 1 1 mix of methanol acetonitrile followed by dichloromethane the dichloromethane and methanol acetonitrile extracts are then successively evaporated under nitrogen and uhp water added for the analysis target compound identification is made by retention time accurate mass and isotope distributions estimates of concentration is based on quantitative ion response and the measurement of the internal standard quantification limits are compound specific and are typically between 0 001 0 1 μg l changes over time have added substances to the suite and lowered detection limits overall measurements have quantified 290 and 315 chemicals above the limit of detection in groundwaters and surface waters respectively 2 2 cas number assignment and excluded substances cas numbers were assigned to each measured substance any measured values for substances lacking a cas number or for which units were not provided were excluded from the analysis such values always comprised 5 of the total number of measured values two sulphur compounds s8 cas number 10 544 50 0 cyclooctasulphur and s6 cas number 13 798 23 7 hexathiane that were detected by gc ms were excluded from the assessment as neither is an organic chemical the steroids cholesterol and squalene were also excluded due to their potentially ubiquitous natural endogenous origin the range of substances included for measurement was 1144 from the combined number of gc ms and lc ms detected analytes this number excludes duplicate substances detected by both methods of this total number of determinands 684 and 769 were detected above the limit of detection in the groundwater or surface water samples by one or both methods 2 3 collection of hazard values hazard values relating to surface water ecological receptors were collected for all substances included in the two analytical suites the hazard values were used for both the surface water and groundwater data sets use for groundwater was considered relevant because i specific values were not available for the sub surface environment and ii groundwater resources will contribute to surface water flows hence values for surface water receptors are relevant the hazard values were taken from the larger set of hc50 values published by posthuma et al 2019 these authors derived these values from a set of species sensitivity distributions ssd generated from the available aquatic ecotoxicological data in a well structured and highly valuable assessment the hazardous concentration for 50 of species hc50 values from these ssds was selected above lower effect thresholds such as the hc5 because the hc50 is placed in the middle of the distribution and so is more robust than values sitting more within the distribution tail for site specific risk assessments the use of values with a higher protection goal such as the hc5 would provide a more precautionary approach 2 4 calculation of mixture risk the overall approach to mixture risk calculation is shown in fig 1 briefly concentrations of all of the substances present above the limit of detection in ground and surface water by gc ms and lc ms were compared to the chronic ssd hc50 for that substance if available to generate a set of hazard quotients measured concentration in groundwater or surface water chronic ssd hc50 value for all of the chemicals in every analysed sample to calculate the mixture risk two models were considered concentration addition and independent action concentration addition was selected rather than independent action for two reasons first of the two models concentration addition generally predicts slightly greater effects for a given mixture than independent action except when response curves are shallow hence the use of concentration addition is precautionary secondly concentration addition only requires a single hazard metric i e a chronic ssd hc50 to calculate contributions to the mixture effect rather than a full response relationship as is needed for independent action but which was not readily available for all substances considered here van gestel et al 2010 based on a concentration addition approach all detected chemicals with a chronic ssd hc50 could be included in the mixture analysis this equated to 725 of the 1144 analysed chemicals n b a full list of chemicals and extracted hc50 values can be found in the supplementary information of spurgeon et al 2022 concentration addition was implemented following the basic equation of altenburger et al 2000 a limitation of the use of concentration addition also applicable to independent action is that if there is no hazard value available for a chemical then that substance simply cannot be included within the mixture calculation this means mixture assessment for a given sample may frequently underestimate risk due to the presence of chemicals lacking a hazard value similarly chemicals that are not detected by the gc ms and lc ms scans e g trace metals are also not included hence while informative our overall approach cannot be taken as an exhaustive assessment of risk for any sample or site 3 results 3 1 calculation of mixture effects substance hqs were calculated for all chemicals present above the lod in a sample by comparing the measured concentration for that substance to its reported chronic ssd hc50 this analysis was conducted separately for all gc ms and lc ms analysed groundwater and surface water samples individual substance hqs were then summed using concentration addition to derive the mixture hazard quotient hereafter hqmix the distribution of hqmix values for all measured samples was then plotted from lowest to highest to allow the distribution of mixture risk to be visualised fig 2 in the groundwater gc ms data set individual substance hqs and calculated hqmix values indicate that as expected a greater number of sites have an hqmix value 1 than is the case for any single chemical the gc ms hqmix was 1 in 64 0 63 of the analysed groundwater samples fig 2a indicating that there were multiple samples in which gc ms measured chemicals would be predicted to impact in some way 50 of the species present based on the mixture exposure exceeding the calculated hazard value 50 of species for lc ms substances no site has an hqmix 1 however an hqmix of 0 1 was found for 89 of 878 sites 10 1 fig 2c this is greater than the number of sites showing this degree of mixture hazard for any single lc ms measured chemical the greater number of sites with hqmix values 1 or 0 1 in both the gc ms and lc ms measured chemicals in groundwater indicates additional cumulative hazard from mixtures above that for any single chemical in surface water there was also a greater number of sites with a chronic ssd hc50 hqmix 1 than sites with an hq 1 for any single chemical for the gc ms data a hqmix 1 is found in 876 samples 4 3 fig 2b although of these 572 samples were characterised by the presence of rotenone at piscicidal levels this high predicted risk for this chemical is based on an hc50 value that comes from a high quality ssd derived from measured data posthuma et al 2019 the presence of high rotenone levels is associated with samples taken for analysis to confirm concentrations used for invasive fish species control the detection of high hazard at these rotenone treated sites was useful as it confirm method capacity to identify sites with high chemical associated risk although such sites cannot be considered representative of wider surface water chemical status the remaining 304 samples 1 4 that had an hqmix 1 all contained multiple gc ms detected chemicals but not rotenone that contributed to the overall mixture effect in the surface water lc ms measurement data set a value of hqmix 1 is found in a single sample 0 03 fig 2d whereas no single chemical has a chronic ssd hc50 hq 1 a greater number of sites with an hqmix 0 1 are also found compared to the values of hq 1 for any single substance calculation of hqmix for both measurement methods and sample types indicates that mixture assessment identifies a greater scale of potential impacts due to the presence of multiple chemicals than for any single chemical the identification of a greater number of sites with hqmix 1 by gc ms compared to lc ms may simply be the product of the greater number of samples analysed by gc ms 16 000 for groundwater 22 000 for surface water compared to lc ms 800 for groundwater 2200 for surface water this greater number gives an order of magnitude or more potential to find locally high concentrations of one or more chemicals giving an hqmix 1 alternatively substances detected by gc ms may be more likely to exceed hazard thresholds because of their specific physicochemical characteristics further work would be needed to tease apart the relevance of both of these factors and their role in determining mixture risk 3 2 contribution of the most important single chemical to the mixture effect to assess the importance of the most toxic chemical to mixture risk the cumulative distribution of the proportional contribution of the most important individual substance hq to hqmix was calculated for all groundwater and surface water gc ms and lc ms sample measurements fig 3 if hqmix is equal to the hq of the most important toxic chemical hereafter hqmax then that chemical contributes all of the mixture effect in such cases the evaluation effectively is a single substance assessment and no longer needs to consider mixtures in those cases where hqmax 0 5 then the most toxic substance contributes half of the mixture effect and where hqmax 0 2 then one fifth of the total mixture effect is due to the most important chemical for gc ms chemicals in groundwater the most important chemical hqmax contributes to 20 of hqmix in 2 of 9365 0 02 samples and 50 of hqmix in 516 samples 5 5 fig 3a this compares to 6013 62 of samples where hqmax is between 50 and 100 of hqmix indicating the most risky substance contributes half of the mixture effect and 3034 samples 32 4 where hqmax 1 indicating that only a single substance contributes for gc ms detected chemicals in surface water there are 9 of 19 911 0 05 of samples where hqmax contributes 20 of hqmix and 1984 10 of samples where hqmax is 50 of hqmix fig 3c this compares to 15 241 sample 76 5 where hqmax is 50 but less 100 of hqmix and 2677 13 4 sites where hqmax 1 indicating only a single chemical contribution for lc ms detected chemicals in groundwater hqmax always contributes 20 to hqmix there are 55 of 818 sites 7 2 when hqmax 0 5 indicating that the most toxic chemical contributes less than 50 to the mixture effect fig 3b this compares to 645 sites 78 9 where hqmax is 50 of hqmix and only a single sample where hqmax 1 indicating the contribution of a single substance although 433 53 2 of all samples have an hqmax 90 of hqmix indicating that one chemical contributes a large proportion of the mixture effect for the lc ms analytes in surface water 32 samples 1 2 have an hqmax that contributes 20 to hqmix and there are 1010 samples 38 2 where the most toxic chemical contributes 50 of hqmix fig 3d this compares to 1602 60 6 where hqmax is 50 but less 100 of hqmix there is also a single sample where hqmax 1 indicating the presence of a single substance although 159 6 have an hqmax 90 of hqmix indicating the dominance of a single chemical 3 3 relationship of hqmix with the number of chemicals detected in the sample mixture hqmix may be expected to increase as mixture complexity increases given that more chemicals are present at detectable concentrations to contribute to the overall effect to test this hypothesis chronic ssd hc50 calculated values of hqmix were plotted against the number of chemicals present in the sample an increase in the number of chemicals detected was weakly associated with a higher value of hqmix fig 4 a d there are however numerous samples at which high values of hqmix are found even when the number of chemicals contributing is relatively low 5 especially in the gc ms data set as mixture complexity increases the number of samples with low hqmix values tends to reduce such that for mixtures of 10 substances relatively low values of hqmix are rarely found fig 4a d this pattern of a reduced number of low hqmix sites at high complexity is consistent across measurement methods and sampled environments this suggest that as chemical number increases overall mixture effect tends to increase although some cases do still occur where multiple low levels are present compared to respective hc50s and a small mixture effect remains 3 4 number of chemicals detected and the contribution of the most toxic chemical hqmax to assess how the most toxic single chemical contribution changes with mixture complexity hqmax was plotted against the number of chemicals contributing to the mixture effect fig 5 a d even when there are relatively few chemicals present 3 there are still cases where the most important chemical contributes around 0 4 of hqmix these samples represent cases of substantial mixture effect at low mixture complexity as the number of substances in the mixture increases to 10 there is a trend for hqmax to decrease although this pattern is not strong indeed even when the mixture becomes quite complex 15 chemicals there still remains samples where the most important chemical still contributes 50 of hqmix in all data sets fig 5a d 4 discussion chemical mixture assessment is a complex task any mixture analysis by its nature will have specific assumptions and limitations this is the case with the approach adopted here the method was based on the use of concentration addition this model is particularly well suited for mixture assessments made using single value hazard thresholds because the mixture effects can be calculated without access to full concentration response relationship something needed for independent action but which is rarely available van gestel et al 2010 this means that the decision of model choice for risk assessment is primarily a pragmatic one based on data availability rather than any mechanistic considerations despite the practical benefits of using an approach based on concentration addition there are also some theoretical and practical issues with the use of this model that are relevant to the interpretation of outcomes the concentration addition model assumes that substances exert effects through a similar mode of action given the range of substances detected a common mechanism is rarely if ever likely to be applicable this means that assessment done using the concentration addition model may not accurately predict the true mixture effect mixture assessment using concentration addition may result in a more precautionary mixture effect prediction than use of independent action although previous studies have suggested that the absolute magnitude of this difference is often relatively small backhaus 2016 cedergreen et al 2008 concentration addition is generally accepted to result in a more conservative mixture effect prediction than the independent action model and so is well suited for initial screening and risk characterisation van gestel et al 2010 the assessment conducted with concentration addition here may mean that the magnitude of mixture effects compared to worst case single chemical may be overestimated compared to the true situation a further issue with a concentration addition approach is that the model assumes that all chemicals in the mixture act independently without interacting as a consequence synergistic or antagonistic effects are not accounted for there is a widely accepted potential for synergism or antagonism to occur in a small but potentially significant number of mixture cases belden et al 2007 cedergreen 2014 martin et al 2021 studies have shown that the effects of synergistic or antagonistic interactions can be cumulative cedergreen et al 2012 however probability also means that when mixture complexity rises the probability for counteracting synergistic or antagonistic interactions also increases as a result more complex mixtures may trend more to additivity than simpler mixtures in which a single synergistic or antagonistic interaction may dominate tian et al 2012 warne and hawker 1995 the mixture assessment was conducted by comparing the reported concentrations of a chemical detected with the chronic ssd hc50 value for that substance an obvious limitation of the mixture analysis is therefore that the assessment can only consider substances that are both detected above the limit of detection and also for which posthuma et al 2019 have reported a chronic ssd hc50 value only the case for 80 of detected chemicals the gc ms and lc ms methods used provided the potential to detect a wide range of different organic chemicals however not all organic chemicals that are potential pollutants are included in the analysis as a result some substances are missing from the assessment in addition to those present at concentrations below the analytical detection limit given that different suites of substances are detected by each method the outcome of the analysis is operationally defined by the diversity of chemicals included in the analytical suite hence each method only captures a snapshot of the potential mixture risk within each analysis certain classes of substances more amenable to detection by other methods are excluded thus the lc ms method measures many pesticide and pharmaceuticals but not many classical persistent organic pollutants pcbs pbdes pahs while for gc ms the opposite is the case a merger of hqs could potentially have been conducted for substances detected by both methods in cases where samples were taken at the same time and location however there are technical issues with such a merger for example differences in the detection limits between the analysis methods would result in the inclusion of a greater number of lc ms than gc ms chemicals this difference in the number of chemicals included due to method sensitivity would be important when considering specific aspects of the mixture effect such as how many substances contribute and any relationships between that number and the contribution of the most important single chemical further the different physicochemical properties of the substance in each of these target screens could accentuate any such differences even if analyses outcomes were combined this would still be an underestimation of total mixture effect since the target screen substance selection misses not only some organic chemicals but also the contribution of inorganic chemicals which are frequently highlighted as the substances most likely to present relative high risk in surface waters donnachie et al 2014 johnson et al 2017 a further limitation of the overall approach is the semi quantitative nature of the concentrations measurements made further substance calibrations would be needed and are underway to verify measurements made for specific substance groups of high interest e g pfas compounds to provide greater certainty on the analytical accuracy of the individual substance measurements although there are challenges for mixture analyses and interpretation using concentration addition the approach has an established history for pragmatic and conservative field based mixture assessment dezwart et al 2006 piliere et al 2014 schell et al 2018 schipper et al 2014 past mixture studies have used a range of metrics derived from single species studies e g the lc50 for daphnia sp as the hazard term for mixture assessment schell et al 2018 verro et al 2009 the approach here benefits from assessing mixture effects against a hazard value derived based on a wider set of toxicity information organised in a species sensitivity distribution rather than on a metric derived for a single species as such it provides a more holistic basis for assessing mixture effects at the ecosystem level chemicals are generally present in the environment as mixtures the results of the groundwater and surface water monitoring programs clearly illustrate the presence of multiple chemicals in both environments for example measurements by lc ms almost always showed the presence of 5 chemicals and in some samples up to 70 chemicals were found within the analysed samples see fig 4 only when the detection limits are relatively high as in the gc ms analysis is the ubiquitous presence of a cocktail of chemicals not seen however this is almost certainly due to the inability of this method to detect chemicals at low concentrations rather than a true absence of a complex chemical mixture at the sampled locations use of concentration addition to predict a combined hazard for the detected mixtures as hqmix indicated that as would be expected there was a greater hazard from mixtures than was the case for any single substance by comparing worst case single chemical and mixture effect predictions it is possible to comment on the scale of this additional mixture hazard compared to the worst case single chemical case backhaus 2016 drakvik et al 2020 for the gc ms and lc ms data sets assessment of the contribution of the most toxic chemical hqmax to the mixture effect hqmix indicated that in 50 of samples the presence of further chemicals beyond the most toxic substance causes a 2 fold increase in indicated hazard i e 50 of sites have an hqmax 50 of hqmix in only a small proportion of samples 1 5 does the presence of further chemicals results in a 5 fold increase in the predicted mixture hazard compared to that for the most toxic substance i e hqmax 20 of hqmix such information may be important if developing an assessment factor that could account for mixture effects as it represents the ratio between the most important compound and the total mixture hazard within the analysis the nature of the substances making the largest contribution to the mixture effect vary between analytical measurement methods and the sampled environments spurgeon et al 2022 conducted a worse case risk ranking of substances in both groundwater and surface water using the same set environmental measurement data this analysis indicated that a number of industrial e g pahs plastics associated chemicals and legacy pesticides were highly ranked in groundwater more personal care products and pharmaceuticals were highly ranked in surface waters and perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl and current use pesticides were highly ranked in both compartments these classes of substance are similarly often major contributors to the mixture hazard predicted here for the groundwater and surface water samples the results from this analysis on the magnitude of difference between hqmax and hqmix is consistent with the conclusions of previous comparative single chemical and mixture effect studies for example backhaus and karlsson 2014 used a similar approach as used here to calculate mixture assessment factors for pharmaceuticals from their analysis these authors concluded that a maximum value of 4 3 was needed to scale from worst case single chemical to the additive mixture effect rorije et al 2022 also came to the conclusion that the most toxic chemical often contributed a substantial proportion of the overall mixture effect based on an analysis conducted for european fresh water ecosystems using the norman chemical monitoring database these authors were however reticent to define a value of the magnitude of any assessment factor that could be placed on the most important chemical to protect against mixture effects although further analysis was planned towards this objective the results found in these previous studies on the nature of proportionate contribution of chemicals to mixture effects are clearly mirrored in the current work thus there is only 1 of samples in which the most important chemical contributed 20 to the overall mixture effects the coalescence of the conclusions from these multiple studies suggests that a mixture assessment factor of five placed on the hq of the most important chemical could adequately protect for possible mixture effects as however the process needed to identify the most important chemical matches that used to identify the additive sum of mixture effects the actual mixture effect can also be equally readily calculated in monitoring studies such a mixture assessment can provide a more robust analysis that is neither over protective or more rarely under protective than considering only the individual chemicals detected at a given site 5 conclusions 1 hazard quotients were determined using chronic ssd hc50 values for 80 of the substances detected by semi quantitative gc ms and lc ms analysis of groundwater and surface water samples a concentration addition approach was used to calculate the mixture effect from the individual substance hq values 2 additional hazard compared to that for any single chemical was found for the calculated mixture effect although the magnitude of this additional risk was not always large 3 consistent patterns were present in all data sets thus the most toxic substance contributed 50 of the mixture effect in 99 of cases and greater mixture complexity was associated with increased mixture effect although only weakly so 4 the consistent finding that the most toxic chemical very often contributed most of the mixture effect suggests that a mixture assessment factor of five placed on the hq for the most important single substance would be sufficient to account for any mixture effects

15822,the bioconversion of waste activated sludge was into methane is usually limited by the poor hydrolysis of sludge and or poor syntrophic methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion ad in this study the underlying mechanism of mof 808 enhancing hydrolysis and syntrophic methanogenesis during ad process of was was investigated experimentally with the effects of mof 808 150 mg mof 808 g volatile solid vs the methane production and the proportion of methane in biogas increased by approximately 26 7 and 15 6 respectively and the lag phase of methanogenesis decreased by 50 8 which indicate that mof 808 enhanced the generation efficiency of methane the changes in activities of main hydrolytic enzymes with and without mof 808 150 mg mof 808 g vs during ad process revealed that mof 808 improved the enzymatic hydrolysis of sludge and the abiotic hydrolysis of sludge extracellular organic substances by mof 808 shows that the maximum proportion and the initial increasing rate of low molecular weight fractions increased by 60 and 583 7 respectively indicating that mof 808 can greatly enhance the hydrolysis degree and rate of sludge via abiotic effect these demonstrate that mof 808 enhanced both biological and abiotic hydrolysis of sludge during ad in addition changes in the concentrations of acetate kinase and volatile fatty acids vfas with and without mof 808 150 mg mof 808 g vs during ad process showed that mof 808 accelerated the bioconversion of vfas to methane suggesting mof 808 has a positive effect on syntrophic metabolism for methanogenesis moreover further analyses of the microbial community structure of sludge samples with and without mof 808 150 mg mof 808 g vs showed that mof 808 enriched hydrogen producing bacteria and mixotrophic methanogens i e methanosarcina and changed the methanogenic pathway via accelerating proton transfer between syntrophic anaerobes especially improving the reduction of co2 to methane and resulting in highly efficient syntrophic methanogenesis these findings however may provide an important reference for enhancing ad efficiency of was based on mof like materials graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge anaerobic digestion metal organic frameworks biodegradation proton transfer methane production 1 introduction waste activated sludge was generated from municipal wastewater treatment contains large amounts of complex organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides which are a potential source of renewable energy baek et al 2021 anaerobic digestion ad is considered as a promising technology for sustainable development of sludge and has the ability to harvest bioenergy via converting the organic matter to methane from was liu et al 2021c luo et al 2022 however the low ad efficiency of was i e low methane production and methane proportion in biogas which is attributed to the poor hydrolysis of complex organic matter and the poor syntrophic metabolism of the anaerobes has restricted the widespread implementation of this technology xu et al 2021 the ad of sludge typically involves three main stages namely hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis liu et al 2021b out of them hydrolysis of organic matters is regarded as the key rate limiting step due to the complex and stable floc structure of the sludge resulting in the low methane production zhen et al 2017 a variety of sludge pretreatment methods have been used to accelerate the hydrolysis of sludge including mechanical thermal and chemical methods and have achieved great progress in enhancing the bioavailability of sludge for subsequent microbial methanogenesis kim et al 2010 kinnunen et al 2015 zhen et al 2014 nevertheless many problems restrict the wider application of these sludge pretreatment methods including the additional energy they require and the greenhouse gases they emit metal organic frameworks mofs a type of inorganic organic microporous crystalline material have recently attracted much attention as a result of their ability to act as recyclable catalysts for accelerating the hydrolysis of organics without requiring additional energy or generating greenhouse gases bai et al 2016 in particular zirconium zr based mofs zr mofs such as uio 66 nu 1000 and mof 808 not only exhibit excellent catalytic hydrolysis ability but also have higher stability than many other reported mofs e g hkust 1 in aqueous media mainly due to their containing highly charged metal ions such as zr6o4 oh 4 co2 12 in zr mofs bai et al 2016 li et al 2014 ly et al 2018 wang et al 2016 for example mof 808 with high stability has been identified to maintain excellent organophosphate based organics hydrolysis ryu et al 2019 also ly et al 2018 found that after 25 h of reaction the mof 808 already triggered 55 protein hydrolysis under physiological environment i e at ph of 7 4 and temperature of 60 c simultaneously the mof 808 exhibited remarkable stability throughout the hydrolytic process notably the network structure of zr mofs e g pore size shape and particle size directly influences the hydrolytic reaction rate by changing the accessibilities of their active sites as such the enhancing hydrolysis rate ability of the above mentioned zr mofs decreases in the order mof 808 nu 1000 uio 66 azambuja et al 2021 based on these considerations it can be proposed that the stable zr mofs especially mof 808 hold great potential to advance the hydrolysis of sludge organic matter under thermophilic ad conditions i e at a temperature of 55 c and a ph of 6 8 7 2 moreover the methanogenesis step is usually restricted by the microbes inefficient syntrophic metabolism of intermediate products to methane which is attributable to inefficient interspecies electron transfer iet between fermentative bacteria and methanogens liu et al 2021a the traditional iet with hydrogen h2 as electron carrier is known as interspecies hydrogen transfer iht reaction 1 however the diffusion limitation of electron carriers with low concentrations significantly reduced the efficiency of iet thereby constraining the effectiveness of methanogenesis li et al 2021 recently conductive materials have been used as electrical conduits to achieve direct interspecies electron transfer diet reaction 2 between syntrophic electro microbes which avoids the diffusion of electron carriers and exhibits higher electron transfer efficiency than iht liu et al 2012 conductive materials such as granular activated carbon biochar and carbon cloth have been proven to accelerate the syntrophic conversion of simple organics to methane by triggering diet in defined co cultures of geobacter metallireducens and methanosarcina barkeri chen et al 2014b 2014a liu et al 2012 however in the actual ad system of complex matter e g food waste was and excess straw the scarcity of electroactive microbes i e geobacter and syntrophus and the limited availability of electron donors for diet severely curtail the establishment and efficiency of diet even in the presence of conductive materials zhao et al 2017 in addition studies with conductive magnetite suggested that acetate dependent methanogenesis rather than diet based co2 dependent methanogenesis was the primary enhancer of methane production from high solids sludge wang et al 2018b given the above it remains difficult to realise high efficiency syntrophic methanogenesis in the ad of sludge by using diet instead of iht processes in fact during the methanogenic process the reduction of com s s cob as the terminal electron acceptor need consume proton to replenish hs cob and hs com pool for completing methanogenesis welte and deppenmeier 2014 therefore the enhancement of proton transfer may constitute a more feasible and effective approach than other methods for enhancing syntrophic methanogenesis in this vein zhang et al 2018 reported that adding dissolved bicarbonate as a proton carrier can increase the diffusion rate of protons to promote the ad efficiency of butyrate while the continuous consumption cost of dissolved proton carriers remains problematic consequently the development of recyclable materials that function as stable proton carriers is a novel and potentially powerful way to increase the efficiency of methanogenesis in the ad of sludge 1 hco 3 4 h 2 h c h 4 3 h 2 o 2 hco 3 9 h 8 e c h 4 3 h 2 o the water stable compound mof 808 is particularly useful in this context as in addition to its ability to enhance hydrolysis it is a highly efficient conductor of protons in aqueous systems with proton conductivities of up to 10 3 s cm 1 having been achieved jiang et al 2014 luo et al 2017 peng et al 2018 for example luo et al 2017 found that the superior water stability mof 808 exhibited an outstanding proton conductivity 7 58 10 3 s cm 1 at 41 c and 99 relative humidity in an aqueous system also the imidazole encapsulated sample im mof 808 has been demonstrated to possess high proton conductivity of 3 45 10 3 s cm 1 at 65 c and 99 relative humidity and simultaneously exhibit stable proton conduction luo et al 2019 in an aqueous system these observations suggest that the water stable mof 808 could be the outstanding candidate for enhancing proton transfer in the syntrophic methanogenesis of ad based on the above consideration it thus can be proposed that the mof 808 with both high catalytic hydrolysis and proton conducting ability is expected to greatly advance the ad efficiency of was however to our best knowledge the effect of mof 808 on ad of sludge has yet to be explored in this study we first propose the application of mof 808 in thermophilic ad of sludge aiming to evaluate the contributions of mof 808 to ad of sludge in terms of strengthening hydrolysis of sludge organics and simultaneously enhancing syntrophic methanogenesis from was specifically the enhancement of methane production and methane proportion in biogas with the addition of mof 808 was confirmed thereafter the effect of mof 808 on hydrolysis of sludge organic matter i e hydrolysis degree and rate was investigated and the corresponding underlying mechanism was revealed finally in accordance with the results of the changes in the volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations as well as the microbial community structure with and without mof 808 addition the effect of mof 808 on syntrophic methanogenesis during ad was explored to the best of our knowledge this study was the first attempt to propose catalyst for the simultaneous enhancement of sludge organics hydrolysis and syntrophic methanogenesis in ad which can provide an important reference for developing novel catalyst application in ad of sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 mof 808 and sludges mof 808 was synthesised solvothermally by heating solutions containing a zirconium salt the acid form of the organic linker and formic acid which functioned as a modulating agent as described in the literature

on net methane production from sludge the methane production from sludge with and without mof 808 are presented in fig 1 a the net cumulative methane production increased from days 0 to 22 whereas no significant changes were observed after 22 days indicating the methane production occurred mainly in the first 22 days of ad this consequence is consistent with the findings of xu et al 2021 who also found a complete ad in the 20 days period mof 808 exhibited concentration dependent effects on the net cumulative methane production of ad as the mof 808 dosage was increased from 0 to 150 mg g vs the net cumulative methane production increased from 154 0 to 195 1 ml ch4 g vs especially the net methane production at the dosage of 150 mg g vs increased by 26 7 compared to the no mof 808 dosage to further evaluate the impacts of mof 808 on the methane production kinetics the gompertz models were used to fit the experimental data of net cumulative methane production in all groups the kinetic parameters of the simulated methane production curves are listed in table s2 sm the model captured the measured data accurately with r2 0 99 in each case it is obvious that mof 808 at full scale levels i e 50 100 and 150 mg g vs significantly shortened the lag phase of ad and the lag phase in the mof 808 150 group exhibited the largest drop which decreased from 4 3 d to 2 1 d in comparison to that in the control the shortened lag phase was consistent with the trend of the measured net cumulative methane production see fig 1 a which obviously rose from days 2 in the mof 808 150 group but rose from days 4 in the control the result might be attributable to the enhanced hydrolysis acidification of sludge organic matter and the accelerated degradation of vfas after adding mof 808 see detail in section 3 2 which was also consistent with the study of ko et al 2018 who found that the shorter lag phase was due to the faster organic decomposition and vfas conversion during ad except for the increase of net cumulative methane production with adding mof 808 the methane proportions in the biogas were also promoted by the mof 808 during ad as seen in fig 1 b the proportions of methane in biogas from all the mof 808 treated groups i e mof 808 50 mof 808 100 and mof 808 150 were invariably higher than that from the control group in all mof 808 treated groups the methane proportion in biogas was approximately stabilized at 81 which exhibited a significant increase compared to the control 15 6 indicating that more carbon was biologically converted into methane during ad with adding mof 808 one reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that mof 808 enhanced the metabolic reduction of co2 or carbonyl group of the acetate to methane via regulating the microbial community structure thereby resulting in a higher methane contents in the biogas in general the increase in methane production from ad of was is usually inseparable from the improvement of the biodegradability of sludge organic matter and the enhancement of syntrophic metabolism of the functional microbes xu et al 2020 given that mof 808 shortened the lag phase and enhanced methane production potential as well as methane proportion in biogas during ad we thus proposed that mof 808 as heterogenous catalyst could enhance the hydrolysis of sludge organic matters and simultaneously change the methanogenic pathway of anaerobes via enhancing the delivery of proton thereby improving the biodegradability of sludge and optimizing the syntrophic metabolism of functional microbes and resulting in an improvement of methane production 3 2 effect of mof 808 on the hydrolysis and acidification of sludge organic matters to prove the above mentioned hypothesis the contribution of mof 808 on the hydrolysis of sludge organic matter was first explored in terms of the changes in activities of main hydrolysis enzymes i e protease and α glucosidase during ad of sludge fig 2 illustrates the changes in the relative activity of key hydrolysis enzymes after adding 150 mg g vs mof 808 during the initial ad process as shown in fig 2 during ad process the maximum increase of protease and α glucosidase activities in the mof 808 150 group relative to that in the control was 168 9 and 191 2 respectively indicating that mof 808 significantly enhanced the activities of these enzymes which demonstrates that the enzymatic hydrolysis reactions associated with protease and α glucosidase were enhanced during the ad process resulting in the improvement of hydrolysis of sludge organic matter this result also can be supported by the previous findings that the enhancement of sludge hydrolysis is accompanied by the increase of bio hydrolase activity wang et al 2018b however an interesting phenomenon is that during ad process the activity of protease was initially restricted decreasing by 39 6 at day 4 while that of α glucosidase kept on an unchangeable level at day 4 and day 6 and then both exhibited a followed enhancement one possible reason for this observation is that mof 808 itself as an artificial metalloenzyme owning active sites on the outer surface and inner structure ji et al 2022 may perform high affinity for sludge organic matters to trigger a sharp abiotic hydrolysis before the biological hydrolysis enhancement at the initial stage this proposition also can be supported by the previous findings that the hydrolysis of 55 hen egg white lysozyme already occurred after 25 h of incubation with single mof 808 under physiological ph and temperature 7 4 and 60 c ly et al 2018 to further reveal the mechanism of mof 808 promoting hydrolysis of sludge organic matter the effects of mof 808 on the hydrolysis of the eos without bio enzymes were explored fig 3 a and b respectively present the changes in mw distribution of eos from the cg and eg with the same dosage as mof 808 150 group with time during the hydrolytic process as shown in fig 3 the overall trend in both groups was similar the mw distribution of eos first converted from high mw to low mw from day 0 to day 2 and then kept steady after day 3 after day 3 the proportion 40 of relatively high mw 200 kda organic matter in the cg was approximately eight times that in the eg 5 which indicates that mof 808 promoted the degree of hydrolysis of high mw eos moreover the proportion of relatively low mw 200 kda organic matter in the eg was significantly higher than that in the cg throughout the entire hydrolysis process for example the maximum proportion of low mw eos was approximately 96 in the eg but only 60 in the cg further indicating that the degree of hydrolysis in the biopolymers of sludge organic matter was significantly strengthened with the effects of mof 808 in addition as shown in fig 3 a and b within 1 day from day 0 to day 1 the proportion of relatively low mw 200 kda organic matter in the eg increased from 26 8 to 77 5 with an initial increasing rate of 188 7 which was approximately 6 8 times that in the cg with an initial increasing rate of 27 6 indicating that mof 808 enhanced the hydrolysis rate via abiotic effect which is consistent with the previous study ly et al 2018 therefore it can be concluded that the mof 808 not only significantly improved the hydrolysis degree of the sludge organic matters but also increased the hydrolysis rate of the sludge organic matters via abiotic effect this result can also explain the phenomenon that with the addition of mof 808 the lag phase of ad was shortened fig 1 a and the activity of protease was initially restricted at day 4 fig 2 based on the above findings we conclude that mof 808 can catalyze the abiotic depolymerization of the sludge organic matter and trigger the enhancement of the key bio hydrolases activities resulting in the enhancement of hydrolysis degree and rate during ad process moreover the initial increase in the hydrolysis of sludge organic matter is primarily attributable to the abiotic catalysis of hydrolysis by mof 808 to explore the effects of mof 808 on the acidification of sludge the vfas generated from the ad of was with and without mof 808 were investigated fig 4 presents the changes in vfas production and compositions from the control and the mof 808 150 group the activity of ak and changes in the ph with and without mof 808 during ad are shown in figs s1 and s2 sm respectively ak is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of hydrolysed products to acetate and thus its activity reflects the acidification of sludge in ad feng et al 2014 as seen in fig s1 sm in comparison to the control the activity of ak in the mof 808 150 group was increased during the early stage of the ad of sludge from day 4 to day 12 the maximum increase in the activity of ak in mof 808 150 group relative to that in the control was 240 and occurred on day 4 indicating that mof 808 significantly increased ak activity which also suggest that the acidification of sludge organic matter could be improved with the addition of mof 808 contrary to the result of high ak activity in the mof 808 150 group as shown in fig 4 we were interested to note that the accumulation of vfas concentrations obtained from the mof 808 150 group was always lower than that obtained from the control during the whole ad process except day 4 on day 4 the maximum concentration of total vfas in the control 3 349 3 mg cod l was similar to that in the mof 808 150 group 3 366 6 mg cod l despite the largest mof 808 triggered increase in ak activity occurring on this day fig s1 sm these results are similar to the findings of wang et al 2018b who showed that vfa concentrations significantly decreased with increasing ak activity during the ad of sludge due to the enhanced syntrophic methanogenesis with adding magnetite thus it is logical that mof 808 improved the bioconversion of intermediate products i e vfas to methane during the ad of sludge another noteworthy phenomenon from fig 4 is that from day 4 to day 8 the concentrations of vfas in the control remained high but those in mof 808 150 group decreased rapidly which indicates that mof 808 accelerated the bioconversion of vfas during ad process specifically within 4 days from day 4 to day 8 the concentrations of acetate in the mof 808 150 group decreased from 1 741 0 mg cod l to 274 6 mg cod l with a decreasing rate of 534 0 which was more than 9 6 times that in the control decreasing from 1 725 5 mg cod l to 1 112 1 mg cod l with a decreasing rate of 55 2 further indicating mof 808 accelerated the acetate consumption which also can be supported by the changes of ph in the mof 808 150 group fig s2 sm these results confirm that mof 808 decreased the duration of the lag phase of methane production based on the above findings we conclude that mof 808 not only improved the hydrolysis acidification of sludge but also accelerated the bioconversion of intermediate products to methane which may be triggered by mof 808 based proton conduction zhang et al 2018 3 3 effect of mof 808 on the microbial community to reveal the effects of mof 808 on the microbial community structure the microbial diversity and microbial community in the control group and the mof 808 150 group during ad were analyzed by high throughput sequencing the statistics of the bacterial community and archaea community in terms of alpha diversity and richness are listed in table s3 sm three indexes including chao richness estimator shannon s and simpson s diversity index are presented a higher chao index indicates higher species richness whereas a higher shannon index and a lower simpson index indicate the lower community diversity lin et al 2018 shi et al 2019 the coverage values of all samples approached 1 00 which indicates that the results adequately reflect the characteristics of microbial communities as shown in table s3 sm the lower shannon index values and the higher simpson index values were obtained at the bacterial operational taxonomic unit otu levels after adding the mof 808 indicating a decrease in the bacterial diversity in the mof 808 150 group the value of chao index in the mof 808 150 group was lower than that in the control indicating a decrease in species richness after adding mof 808 during the ad of sludge a similar trend of species diversity and richness was seen in in the archaeal community both the chao and shannon index values at the otu levels of archaea were slightly lower in the mof 808 150 group than in the control indicating that mof 808 led to a slight decrease in both archaeal diversity and richness during the ad of sludge based on these results it is concluded that mof 808 decreased the diversity and richness of both bacterial and archaeal species during ad of sludge which may be attributable to the enrichment of some functional microbes after adding mof 808 this supposition can be further corroborated by the variations in the bacterial and archaeal community structure as described below changes in the microbial community structure during ad in the presence and absence of mof 808 were examined by determining the taxonomic distributions of bacterial communities at the phylum class and genus levels these distributions are depicted in fig 5 with bacteria whose relative abundance was less than 2 0 categorised as others the raw data for the bacterial communities at these three levels are given in fig s3 as shown in fig 5 a during the ad of sludge the bacterial phyla firmicutes 43 4 proteobacteria 10 6 chloroflexi 9 2 and actinobacteriota 8 3 were dominant in the control whilst firmicutes 47 6 coprothermobacterota 14 0 proteobacteria 9 2 and chloroflexi 5 3 were dominant in the mof 808 150 group one notable result from fig 5 a is that the proportions of the phyla firmicutes and coprothermobacterota were both higher in the mof 808 150 group than those in the control indicating that mof 808 increased the relative abundances of these phyla during the ad of sludge here the firmicutes accounting for the largest proportion was reported to be essential participant at the hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation in ad and can generate available substances for methanogenesis antwi et al 2017 peces et al 2018 in addition fig 5 a demonstrates that although the proportion of the phylum coprothermobacterota in the control group was relatively low 3 9 its abundance in the mof 808 150 group was high and became the second most dominant species 14 0 coprothermobacterota primarily functions to degrade proteins and generate anaerobic metabolites e g vfas h2 which is critical for the methanogenesis processes of syntrophic metabolism tandishabo et al 2012 accordingly it is plausible that mof 808 enhances the hydrolysis acidification of sludge organic matter by increasing the relative abundance of firmicutes and coprothermobacterota thereby supporting syntrophic metabolism and facilitating methanogenesis during ad this also accounts for the kinetics of methane production during the ad of sludge in the presence of mof 808 fig 5 b shows that bacilli phylum firmicutes 20 7 clostridia phylum firmicutes 16 0 anaerolineae phylum chloroflexi 8 4 and gammaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria 7 8 were the dominant bacterial classes in the cg while bacilli phylum firmicutes 23 5 clostridia phylum firmicutes 19 4 and coprothermobacteria phylum coprothermobacterota 14 0 were dominant in the mof 808 150 group notably as shown in fig 5 b the relative abundances of bacilli clostridia and coprothermobacteria in the mof 808 150 group were significantly higher than those in the control group indicating that mof 808 increased the abundances of these classes in sludge during ad amongst the three classes the relative abundance of the class coprothermobacteria exhibited the maximum increase in the mof 808 150 group which increased by 259 0 compared to that in the control group in addition fig 5 c demonstrates that the bacterial genus with the highest relative abundance in the control group was solibacillus followed by the genera lysinibacillus fervidobacterium and unclassified f caloramatoraceae while the most abundant bacterial genus in the mof 808 150 group was coprothermobacter followed by the genera solibacillus unclassified f caloramatoraceae and caloramator this result indicates that mof 808 significantly affected the community of bacterial genera in sludge during ad in particular the abundance of coprothermobacter class coprothermobacteria in the control was relatively low 3 9 but its abundance accounted for the highest proportion 14 0 in the mof 808 150 group indicating mof 808 enriched the genus coprothermobacter during ad process coprothermobacter are typically common in the thermophilic acidification stage of ad during which they are key for degrading organic matter to produce h2 lee et al 2009 thus it is plausible that mof 808 enriched the concentrations of coprothermobacter during the ad of sludge to enhance the degradation of sludge organic matter and h2 generation which could be used for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in ad fig 5 c also demonstrates that the proportions of three dominant genera solibacillus unclassified f caloramatoraceae and caloramator were also higher in the mof 808 150 group than those in the control 12 7 vs 10 9 7 1 vs 4 0 and 4 7 vs 2 2 respectively indicating mof 808 also enriched these genera amongst the three genera the caloramator with the largest extent enrichment its family clostridiaceae is important syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria that convert acetate to h2 and co2 a process that is strongly correlated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis yue et al 2021 this is evidence that mof 808 enhanced the syntrophic metabolism by increasing iht to further explore how mof 808 affects the methanogenic metabolism of microbes in sludge during ad the archaeal community compositions of the control group and the mof 808 150 group were identified as shown in fig 6 where the archaea with a relative abundance less than 2 00 are categorised as others the raw data on the archaeal communities at these three levels are shown in fig s4 sm the activities of hydrogenase in the control group and the mof 808 150 group at the peak of daily methane production are presented in fig s5 sm as shown in fig 6 a and b the archaeal phyla euryarchaeota and halobacterota were dominant in both the control group and the mof 808 150 group during the ad of sludge whilst the archaeal communities at the class level in both the control group and the mof 808 150 group were consistently composed primarily of methanobacteria phylum euryarchaeota and methanosarcinia phylum halobacterota fig 6 c presents genus level data showing that the archaeal communities in both the control group and the mof 808 150 group were mainly composed of the genera methanosarcina class methanosarcinia and methanothermobacter class methanobacteria which is consistent with the corresponding phylum level and class level data indicating that these two taxonomic groups predominated in both the control group and the mof 808 150 group during the ad of sludge a careful examination of fig 6 c reveals that the average proportions of the genus methanosarcina were significantly higher in the mof 808 150 group than in the control group indicating that mof 808 enriched this genus during ad previous studies have highlighted the importance of methanosarcina to achieve more efficient methanogenesis in ad wang et al 2018a it thus can be inferred that mof 808 enhances methanosarcina related methanogenesis resulting in high methane production during the ad of sludge fig 1 the fact that the metabolic activity of the genus methanosarcina is closely associated with the process of proton translocation welte and deppenmeier 2011 suggests that the enhancement of methanosarcina related methanogenesis might be triggered by high proton transfer ability of mof 808 which can also be supported by previous study beckmann et al 2016 in all methanogenic processes of methanosarcina the reduction of the terminal electron accepting com s s cob to the com sh and cob sh by membrane bound heterodisulfide reductase enzymes is an essential process which usually accompanies with the step of proton translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane of methanogens beckmann et al 2016 it can thus be inferred that mof 808 generates a proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane of methanosarcina which facilitates the translocation of protons and thereby enhances the reduction of com s s cob to com sh and cob sh which consequently triggers more efficient methanogenesis welte and deppenmeier 2014 this explanation can also be supported by the findings of beckmann et al 2016 who found that phenazine crystals enhanced methanogenesis in methanosarcina mazei by generating a proton motive force across its cytoplasmic membrane in addition it has been clear that methanosarcina species are typical mixotrophic microorganisms that are able to produce methane by either consuming acetate or reducing co2 lin et al 2018 and methanothermobacter are typical hydrogenotrophic methanogens yan et al 2017 usually the higher the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens the higher the proportion of methane in biogas from ad xu et al 2021 however in this study we found that despite the relative abundance of methanothermobacter in the mof 808 150 group being lower than that in the control group fig 6 c the proportion of methane in biogas from ad in the mof 808 150 group was higher than that in the control group fig 1 b one logical examination for this observation is that mof 808 facilitated the co2 reduction pathway of methanogenesis in methanosarcina during ad process this was further corroborated by the enrichment of syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria which can produce h2 and co2 notably in this study the electro active bacteria e g geobacter species which can participate in diet in defined co cultures was not detected while the activity of hydrogenase which can imply the activity of hydrogen transfer between anaerobes was enhanced by mof 808 fig s5 sm this result further indicates that mof 808 strengthened the iht rather than diet to improve the co2 reduction pathway methanogenesis which is also supported by the study of zhang et al 2018 who found that the enhanced diffusion rate of dissolved proton carrier can strengthen iht pathway taken together the above findings suggest that mof 808 functions as a high performance proton conductor to accelerate proton transfer related to a traditional syntrophic process i e iht reaction 1 and enhances co2 reduction to methane thereby increasing the proportion of methane in biogas from ad of sludge 4 conclusions in this study mof 808 was first confirmed that mof 808 enhanced methane production during the ad of was moreover we showed that mof 808 enhanced the degree and rate of hydrolysis acidification of sludge substrates and optimised the functional microbe structures for hydrolysis acidification and methanation resulting in the enhancement of methane generation efficiency from was our main conclusions are as follows 1 mof 808 enhanced the methane production and methane proportion in biogas from ad of was with the addition of mof 808 the maximum methane production increased by 26 7 and the maximum methane proportion in biogas was approximately 81 2 mof 808 improved the hydrolysis degree and rate of sludge organic matters during ad by enhancing biological enzymatic hydrolysis and also by its own catalytic hydrolysis activity for example with the effect of mof 808 the activities of protease and α glucosidase during the ad process increased maximally by 68 9 and 91 2 respectively additionally the maximum proportion and the initial increasing rate of low mw organic matters increased by 60 and 583 7 via catalytic hydrolysis of mof 808 itself 3 mof 808 accelerated the bioconversion of hydrolysis acidification products i e vfas to methane during ad for example mof 808 caused a rapid increase 867 4 in the rate of consumption of acetate from day 4 to day 8 4 mof 808 promoted the proton transfer and regulated the methanogenic pathway during ad especially strengthening the reduction of co2 by enrichment of the mixotrophic methanogens i e the abundance of genus methanosarcina increased by 35 5

15822,the bioconversion of waste activated sludge was into methane is usually limited by the poor hydrolysis of sludge and or poor syntrophic methanogenesis during anaerobic digestion ad in this study the underlying mechanism of mof 808 enhancing hydrolysis and syntrophic methanogenesis during ad process of was was investigated experimentally with the effects of mof 808 150 mg mof 808 g volatile solid vs the methane production and the proportion of methane in biogas increased by approximately 26 7 and 15 6 respectively and the lag phase of methanogenesis decreased by 50 8 which indicate that mof 808 enhanced the generation efficiency of methane the changes in activities of main hydrolytic enzymes with and without mof 808 150 mg mof 808 g vs during ad process revealed that mof 808 improved the enzymatic hydrolysis of sludge and the abiotic hydrolysis of sludge extracellular organic substances by mof 808 shows that the maximum proportion and the initial increasing rate of low molecular weight fractions increased by 60 and 583 7 respectively indicating that mof 808 can greatly enhance the hydrolysis degree and rate of sludge via abiotic effect these demonstrate that mof 808 enhanced both biological and abiotic hydrolysis of sludge during ad in addition changes in the concentrations of acetate kinase and volatile fatty acids vfas with and without mof 808 150 mg mof 808 g vs during ad process showed that mof 808 accelerated the bioconversion of vfas to methane suggesting mof 808 has a positive effect on syntrophic metabolism for methanogenesis moreover further analyses of the microbial community structure of sludge samples with and without mof 808 150 mg mof 808 g vs showed that mof 808 enriched hydrogen producing bacteria and mixotrophic methanogens i e methanosarcina and changed the methanogenic pathway via accelerating proton transfer between syntrophic anaerobes especially improving the reduction of co2 to methane and resulting in highly efficient syntrophic methanogenesis these findings however may provide an important reference for enhancing ad efficiency of was based on mof like materials graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge anaerobic digestion metal organic frameworks biodegradation proton transfer methane production 1 introduction waste activated sludge was generated from municipal wastewater treatment contains large amounts of complex organic matter such as proteins and polysaccharides which are a potential source of renewable energy baek et al 2021 anaerobic digestion ad is considered as a promising technology for sustainable development of sludge and has the ability to harvest bioenergy via converting the organic matter to methane from was liu et al 2021c luo et al 2022 however the low ad efficiency of was i e low methane production and methane proportion in biogas which is attributed to the poor hydrolysis of complex organic matter and the poor syntrophic metabolism of the anaerobes has restricted the widespread implementation of this technology xu et al 2021 the ad of sludge typically involves three main stages namely hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis liu et al 2021b out of them hydrolysis of organic matters is regarded as the key rate limiting step due to the complex and stable floc structure of the sludge resulting in the low methane production zhen et al 2017 a variety of sludge pretreatment methods have been used to accelerate the hydrolysis of sludge including mechanical thermal and chemical methods and have achieved great progress in enhancing the bioavailability of sludge for subsequent microbial methanogenesis kim et al 2010 kinnunen et al 2015 zhen et al 2014 nevertheless many problems restrict the wider application of these sludge pretreatment methods including the additional energy they require and the greenhouse gases they emit metal organic frameworks mofs a type of inorganic organic microporous crystalline material have recently attracted much attention as a result of their ability to act as recyclable catalysts for accelerating the hydrolysis of organics without requiring additional energy or generating greenhouse gases bai et al 2016 in particular zirconium zr based mofs zr mofs such as uio 66 nu 1000 and mof 808 not only exhibit excellent catalytic hydrolysis ability but also have higher stability than many other reported mofs e g hkust 1 in aqueous media mainly due to their containing highly charged metal ions such as zr6o4 oh 4 co2 12 in zr mofs bai et al 2016 li et al 2014 ly et al 2018 wang et al 2016 for example mof 808 with high stability has been identified to maintain excellent organophosphate based organics hydrolysis ryu et al 2019 also ly et al 2018 found that after 25 h of reaction the mof 808 already triggered 55 protein hydrolysis under physiological environment i e at ph of 7 4 and temperature of 60 c simultaneously the mof 808 exhibited remarkable stability throughout the hydrolytic process notably the network structure of zr mofs e g pore size shape and particle size directly influences the hydrolytic reaction rate by changing the accessibilities of their active sites as such the enhancing hydrolysis rate ability of the above mentioned zr mofs decreases in the order mof 808 nu 1000 uio 66 azambuja et al 2021 based on these considerations it can be proposed that the stable zr mofs especially mof 808 hold great potential to advance the hydrolysis of sludge organic matter under thermophilic ad conditions i e at a temperature of 55 c and a ph of 6 8 7 2 moreover the methanogenesis step is usually restricted by the microbes inefficient syntrophic metabolism of intermediate products to methane which is attributable to inefficient interspecies electron transfer iet between fermentative bacteria and methanogens liu et al 2021a the traditional iet with hydrogen h2 as electron carrier is known as interspecies hydrogen transfer iht reaction 1 however the diffusion limitation of electron carriers with low concentrations significantly reduced the efficiency of iet thereby constraining the effectiveness of methanogenesis li et al 2021 recently conductive materials have been used as electrical conduits to achieve direct interspecies electron transfer diet reaction 2 between syntrophic electro microbes which avoids the diffusion of electron carriers and exhibits higher electron transfer efficiency than iht liu et al 2012 conductive materials such as granular activated carbon biochar and carbon cloth have been proven to accelerate the syntrophic conversion of simple organics to methane by triggering diet in defined co cultures of geobacter metallireducens and methanosarcina barkeri chen et al 2014b 2014a liu et al 2012 however in the actual ad system of complex matter e g food waste was and excess straw the scarcity of electroactive microbes i e geobacter and syntrophus and the limited availability of electron donors for diet severely curtail the establishment and efficiency of diet even in the presence of conductive materials zhao et al 2017 in addition studies with conductive magnetite suggested that acetate dependent methanogenesis rather than diet based co2 dependent methanogenesis was the primary enhancer of methane production from high solids sludge wang et al 2018b given the above it remains difficult to realise high efficiency syntrophic methanogenesis in the ad of sludge by using diet instead of iht processes in fact during the methanogenic process the reduction of com s s cob as the terminal electron acceptor need consume proton to replenish hs cob and hs com pool for completing methanogenesis welte and deppenmeier 2014 therefore the enhancement of proton transfer may constitute a more feasible and effective approach than other methods for enhancing syntrophic methanogenesis in this vein zhang et al 2018 reported that adding dissolved bicarbonate as a proton carrier can increase the diffusion rate of protons to promote the ad efficiency of butyrate while the continuous consumption cost of dissolved proton carriers remains problematic consequently the development of recyclable materials that function as stable proton carriers is a novel and potentially powerful way to increase the efficiency of methanogenesis in the ad of sludge 1 hco 3 4 h 2 h c h 4 3 h 2 o 2 hco 3 9 h 8 e c h 4 3 h 2 o the water stable compound mof 808 is particularly useful in this context as in addition to its ability to enhance hydrolysis it is a highly efficient conductor of protons in aqueous systems with proton conductivities of up to 10 3 s cm 1 having been achieved jiang et al 2014 luo et al 2017 peng et al 2018 for example luo et al 2017 found that the superior water stability mof 808 exhibited an outstanding proton conductivity 7 58 10 3 s cm 1 at 41 c and 99 relative humidity in an aqueous system also the imidazole encapsulated sample im mof 808 has been demonstrated to possess high proton conductivity of 3 45 10 3 s cm 1 at 65 c and 99 relative humidity and simultaneously exhibit stable proton conduction luo et al 2019 in an aqueous system these observations suggest that the water stable mof 808 could be the outstanding candidate for enhancing proton transfer in the syntrophic methanogenesis of ad based on the above consideration it thus can be proposed that the mof 808 with both high catalytic hydrolysis and proton conducting ability is expected to greatly advance the ad efficiency of was however to our best knowledge the effect of mof 808 on ad of sludge has yet to be explored in this study we first propose the application of mof 808 in thermophilic ad of sludge aiming to evaluate the contributions of mof 808 to ad of sludge in terms of strengthening hydrolysis of sludge organics and simultaneously enhancing syntrophic methanogenesis from was specifically the enhancement of methane production and methane proportion in biogas with the addition of mof 808 was confirmed thereafter the effect of mof 808 on hydrolysis of sludge organic matter i e hydrolysis degree and rate was investigated and the corresponding underlying mechanism was revealed finally in accordance with the results of the changes in the volatile fatty acids vfas concentrations as well as the microbial community structure with and without mof 808 addition the effect of mof 808 on syntrophic methanogenesis during ad was explored to the best of our knowledge this study was the first attempt to propose catalyst for the simultaneous enhancement of sludge organics hydrolysis and syntrophic methanogenesis in ad which can provide an important reference for developing novel catalyst application in ad of sludge 2 materials and methods 2 1 mof 808 and sludges mof 808 was

decomposition was investigated in 14 serum bottles treated with 100 ml of eos these bottles were divided into two groups a control group cg without mof 808 and an experimental group eg with mof 808 in a dosage consistent with those used in the ad batch experiments of the mof 808 150 group to maintain a similar experimental environment as used in the ad experiments the ph values of the cg and the eg bottles were adjusted to approximately 7 0 prior to beginning the experiment after being flushed with n2 for 1 min to maintain anaerobic conditions each group was sealed with a rubber stopper and

on net methane production from sludge the methane production from sludge with and without mof 808 are presented in fig 1 a the net cumulative methane production increased from days 0 to 22 whereas no significant changes were observed after 22 days indicating the methane production occurred mainly in the first 22 days of ad this consequence is consistent with the findings of xu et al 2021 who also found a complete ad in the 20 days period mof 808 exhibited concentration dependent effects on the net cumulative methane production of ad as the mof 808 dosage was increased from 0 to 150 mg g vs the net cumulative methane production increased from 154 0 to 195 1 ml ch4 g vs especially the net methane production at the dosage of 150 mg g vs increased by 26 7 compared to the no mof 808 dosage to further evaluate the impacts of mof 808 on the methane production kinetics the gompertz models were used to fit the experimental data of net cumulative methane production in all groups the kinetic parameters of the simulated methane production curves are listed in table s2 sm the model captured the measured data accurately with r2 0 99 in each case it is obvious that mof 808 at full scale levels i e 50 100 and 150 mg g vs significantly shortened the lag phase of ad and the lag phase in the mof 808 150 group exhibited the largest drop which decreased from 4 3 d to 2 1 d in comparison to that in the control the shortened lag phase was consistent with the trend of the measured net cumulative methane production see fig 1 a which obviously rose from days 2 in the mof 808 150 group but rose from days 4 in the control the result might be attributable to the enhanced hydrolysis acidification of sludge organic matter and the accelerated degradation of vfas after adding mof 808 see detail in section 3 2 which was also consistent with the study of ko et al 2018 who found that the shorter lag phase was due to the faster organic decomposition and vfas conversion during ad except for the increase of net cumulative methane production with adding mof 808 the methane proportions in the biogas were also promoted by the mof 808 during ad as seen in fig 1 b the proportions of methane in biogas from all the mof 808 treated groups i e mof 808 50 mof 808 100 and mof 808 150 were invariably higher than that from the control group in all mof 808 treated groups the methane proportion in biogas was approximately stabilized at 81 which exhibited a significant increase compared to the control 15 6 indicating that more carbon was biologically converted into methane during ad with adding mof 808 one reasonable explanation for this phenomenon is that mof 808 enhanced the metabolic reduction of co2 or carbonyl group of the acetate to methane via regulating the microbial community structure thereby resulting in a higher methane contents in the biogas in general the increase in methane production from ad of was is usually inseparable from the improvement of the biodegradability of sludge organic matter and the enhancement of syntrophic metabolism of the functional microbes xu et al 2020 given that mof 808 shortened the lag phase and enhanced methane production potential as well as methane proportion in biogas during ad we thus proposed that mof 808 as heterogenous catalyst could enhance the hydrolysis of sludge organic matters and simultaneously change the methanogenic pathway of anaerobes via enhancing the delivery of proton thereby improving the biodegradability of sludge and optimizing the syntrophic metabolism of functional microbes and resulting in an improvement of methane production 3 2 effect of mof 808 on the hydrolysis and acidification of sludge organic matters to prove the above mentioned hypothesis the contribution of mof 808 on the hydrolysis of sludge organic matter was first explored in terms of the changes in activities of main hydrolysis enzymes i e protease and α glucosidase during ad of sludge fig 2 illustrates the changes in the relative activity of key hydrolysis enzymes after adding 150 mg g vs mof 808 during the initial ad process as shown in fig 2 during ad process the maximum increase of protease and α glucosidase activities in the mof 808 150 group relative to that in the control was 168 9 and 191 2 respectively indicating that mof 808 significantly enhanced the activities of these enzymes which demonstrates that the enzymatic hydrolysis reactions associated with protease and α glucosidase were enhanced during the ad process resulting in the improvement of hydrolysis of sludge organic matter this result also can be supported by the previous findings that the enhancement of sludge hydrolysis is accompanied by the increase of bio hydrolase activity wang et al 2018b however an interesting phenomenon is that during ad process the activity of protease was initially restricted decreasing by 39 6 at day 4 while that of α glucosidase kept on an unchangeable level at day 4 and day 6 and then both exhibited a followed enhancement one possible reason for this observation is that mof 808 itself as an artificial metalloenzyme owning active sites on the outer surface and inner structure ji et al 2022 may perform high affinity for sludge organic matters to trigger a sharp abiotic hydrolysis before the biological hydrolysis enhancement at the initial stage this proposition also can be supported by the previous findings that the hydrolysis of 55 hen egg white lysozyme already occurred after 25 h of incubation with single mof 808 under physiological ph and temperature 7 4 and 60 c ly et al 2018 to further reveal the mechanism of mof 808 promoting hydrolysis of sludge organic matter the effects of mof 808 on the hydrolysis of the eos without bio enzymes were explored fig 3 a and b respectively present the changes in mw distribution of eos from the cg and eg with the same dosage as mof 808 150 group with time during the hydrolytic process as shown in fig 3 the overall trend in both groups was similar the mw distribution of eos first converted from high mw to low mw from day 0 to day 2 and then kept steady after day 3 after day 3 the proportion 40 of relatively high mw 200 kda organic matter in the cg was approximately eight times that in the eg 5 which indicates that mof 808 promoted the degree of hydrolysis of high mw eos moreover the proportion of relatively low mw 200 kda organic matter in the eg was significantly higher than that in the cg throughout the entire hydrolysis process for example the maximum proportion of low mw eos was approximately 96 in the eg but only 60 in the cg further indicating that the degree of hydrolysis in the biopolymers of sludge organic matter was significantly strengthened with the effects of mof 808 in addition as shown in fig 3 a and b within 1 day from day 0 to day 1 the proportion of relatively low mw 200 kda organic matter in the eg increased from 26 8 to 77 5 with an initial increasing rate of 188 7 which was approximately 6 8 times that in the cg with an initial increasing rate of 27 6 indicating that mof 808 enhanced the hydrolysis rate via abiotic effect which is consistent with the previous study ly et al 2018 therefore it can be concluded that the mof 808 not only significantly improved the hydrolysis degree of the sludge organic matters but also increased the hydrolysis rate of the sludge organic matters via abiotic effect this result can also explain the phenomenon that with the addition of mof 808 the lag phase of ad was shortened fig 1 a and the activity of protease was initially restricted at day 4 fig 2 based on the above findings we conclude that mof 808 can catalyze the abiotic depolymerization of the sludge organic matter and trigger the enhancement of the key bio hydrolases activities resulting in the enhancement of hydrolysis degree and rate during ad process moreover the initial increase in the hydrolysis of sludge organic matter is primarily attributable to the abiotic catalysis of hydrolysis by mof 808 to explore the effects of mof 808 on the acidification of sludge the vfas generated from the ad of was with and without mof 808 were investigated fig 4 presents the changes in vfas production and compositions from the control and the mof 808 150 group the activity of ak and changes in the ph with and without mof 808 during ad are shown in figs s1 and s2 sm respectively ak is a key enzyme involved in the conversion of hydrolysed products to acetate and thus its activity reflects the acidification of sludge in ad feng et al 2014 as seen in fig s1 sm in comparison to the control the activity of ak in the mof 808 150 group was increased during the early stage of the ad of sludge from day 4 to day 12 the maximum increase in the activity of ak in mof 808 150 group relative to that in the control was 240 and occurred on day 4 indicating that mof 808 significantly increased ak activity which also suggest that the acidification of sludge organic matter could be improved with the addition of mof 808 contrary to the result of high ak activity in the mof 808 150 group as shown in fig 4 we were interested to note that the accumulation of vfas concentrations obtained from the mof 808 150 group was always lower than that obtained from the control during the whole ad process except day 4 on day 4 the maximum concentration of total vfas in the control 3 349 3 mg cod l was similar to that in the mof 808 150 group 3 366 6 mg cod l despite the largest mof 808 triggered increase in ak activity occurring on this day fig s1 sm these results are similar to the findings of wang et al 2018b who showed that vfa concentrations significantly decreased with increasing ak activity during the ad of sludge due to the enhanced syntrophic methanogenesis with adding magnetite thus it is logical that mof 808 improved the bioconversion of intermediate products i e vfas to methane during the ad of sludge another noteworthy phenomenon from fig 4 is that from day 4 to day 8 the concentrations of vfas in the control remained high but those in mof 808 150 group decreased rapidly which indicates that mof 808 accelerated the bioconversion of vfas during ad process specifically within 4 days from day 4 to day 8 the concentrations of acetate in the mof 808 150 group decreased from 1 741 0 mg cod l to 274 6 mg cod l with a decreasing rate of 534 0 which was more than 9 6 times that in the control decreasing from 1 725 5 mg cod l to 1 112 1 mg cod l with a decreasing rate of 55 2 further indicating mof 808 accelerated the acetate consumption which also can be supported by the changes of ph in the mof 808 150 group fig s2 sm these results confirm that mof 808 decreased the duration of the lag phase of methane production based on the above findings we conclude that mof 808 not only improved the hydrolysis acidification of sludge but also accelerated the bioconversion of intermediate products to methane which may be triggered by mof 808 based proton conduction zhang et al 2018 3 3 effect of mof 808 on the microbial community to reveal the effects of mof 808 on the microbial community structure the microbial diversity and microbial community in the control group and the mof 808 150 group during ad were analyzed by high throughput sequencing the statistics of the bacterial community and archaea community in terms of alpha diversity and richness are listed in table s3 sm three indexes including chao richness estimator shannon s and simpson s diversity index are presented a higher chao index indicates higher species richness whereas a higher shannon index and a lower simpson index indicate the lower community diversity lin et al 2018 shi et al 2019 the coverage values of all samples approached 1 00 which indicates that the results adequately reflect the characteristics of microbial communities as shown in table s3 sm the lower shannon index values and the higher simpson index values were obtained at the bacterial operational taxonomic unit otu levels after adding the mof 808 indicating a decrease in the bacterial diversity in the mof 808 150 group the value of chao index in the mof 808 150 group was lower than that in the control indicating a decrease in species richness after adding mof 808 during the ad of sludge a similar trend of species diversity and richness was seen in in the archaeal community both the chao and shannon index values at the otu levels of archaea were slightly lower in the mof 808 150 group than in the control indicating that mof 808 led to a slight decrease in both archaeal diversity and richness during the ad of sludge based on these results it is concluded that mof 808 decreased the diversity and richness of both bacterial and archaeal species during ad of sludge which may be attributable to the enrichment of some functional microbes after adding mof 808 this supposition can be further corroborated by the variations in the bacterial and archaeal community structure as described below changes in the microbial community structure during ad in the presence and absence of mof 808 were examined by determining the taxonomic distributions of bacterial communities at the phylum class and genus levels these distributions are depicted in fig 5 with bacteria whose relative abundance was less than 2 0 categorised as others the raw data for the bacterial communities at these three levels are given in fig s3 as shown in fig 5 a during the ad of sludge the bacterial phyla firmicutes 43 4 proteobacteria 10 6 chloroflexi 9 2 and actinobacteriota 8 3 were dominant in the control whilst firmicutes 47 6 coprothermobacterota 14 0 proteobacteria 9 2 and chloroflexi 5 3 were dominant in the mof 808 150 group one notable result from fig 5 a is that the proportions of the phyla firmicutes and coprothermobacterota were both higher in the mof 808 150 group than those in the control indicating that mof 808 increased the relative abundances of these phyla during the ad of sludge here the firmicutes accounting for the largest proportion was reported to be essential participant at the hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and syntrophic acetate oxidation in ad and can generate available substances for methanogenesis antwi et al 2017 peces et al 2018 in addition fig 5 a demonstrates that although the proportion of the phylum coprothermobacterota in the control group was relatively low 3 9 its abundance in the mof 808 150 group was high and became the second most dominant species 14 0 coprothermobacterota primarily functions to degrade proteins and generate anaerobic metabolites e g vfas h2 which is critical for the methanogenesis processes of syntrophic metabolism tandishabo et al 2012 accordingly it is plausible that mof 808 enhances the hydrolysis acidification of sludge organic matter by increasing the relative abundance of firmicutes and coprothermobacterota thereby supporting syntrophic metabolism and facilitating methanogenesis during ad this also accounts for the kinetics of methane production during the ad of sludge in the presence of mof 808 fig 5 b shows that bacilli phylum firmicutes 20 7 clostridia phylum firmicutes 16 0 anaerolineae phylum chloroflexi 8 4 and gammaproteobacteria phylum proteobacteria 7 8 were the dominant bacterial classes in the cg while bacilli phylum firmicutes 23 5 clostridia phylum firmicutes 19 4 and coprothermobacteria phylum coprothermobacterota 14 0 were dominant in the mof 808 150 group notably as shown in fig 5 b the relative abundances of bacilli clostridia and coprothermobacteria in the mof 808 150 group were significantly higher than those in the control group indicating that mof 808 increased the abundances of these classes in sludge during ad amongst the three classes the relative abundance of the class coprothermobacteria exhibited the maximum increase in the mof 808 150 group which increased by 259 0 compared to that in the control group in addition fig 5 c demonstrates that the bacterial genus with the highest relative abundance in the control group was solibacillus followed by the genera lysinibacillus fervidobacterium and unclassified f caloramatoraceae while the most abundant bacterial genus in the mof 808 150 group was coprothermobacter followed by the genera solibacillus unclassified f caloramatoraceae and caloramator this result indicates that mof 808 significantly affected the community of bacterial genera in sludge during ad in particular the abundance of coprothermobacter class coprothermobacteria in the control was relatively low 3 9 but its abundance accounted for the highest proportion 14 0 in the mof 808 150 group indicating mof 808 enriched the genus coprothermobacter during ad process coprothermobacter are typically common in the thermophilic acidification stage of ad during which they are key for degrading organic matter to produce h2 lee et al 2009 thus it is plausible that mof 808 enriched the concentrations of coprothermobacter during the ad of sludge to enhance the degradation of sludge organic matter and h2 generation which could be used for hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in ad fig 5 c also demonstrates that the proportions of three dominant genera solibacillus unclassified f caloramatoraceae and caloramator were also higher in the mof 808 150 group than those in the control 12 7 vs 10 9 7 1 vs 4 0 and 4 7 vs 2 2 respectively indicating mof 808 also enriched these genera amongst the three genera the caloramator with the largest extent enrichment its family clostridiaceae is important syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria that convert acetate to h2 and co2 a process that is strongly correlated with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis yue et al 2021 this is evidence that mof 808 enhanced the syntrophic metabolism by increasing iht to further explore how mof 808 affects the methanogenic metabolism of microbes in sludge during ad the archaeal community compositions of the control group and the mof 808 150 group were identified as shown in fig 6 where the archaea with a relative abundance less than 2 00 are categorised as others the raw data on the archaeal communities at these three levels are shown in fig s4 sm the activities of hydrogenase in the control group and the mof 808 150 group at the peak of daily methane production are presented in fig s5 sm as shown in fig 6 a and b the archaeal phyla euryarchaeota and halobacterota were dominant in both the control group and the mof 808 150 group during the ad of sludge whilst the archaeal communities at the class level in both the control group and the mof 808 150 group were consistently composed primarily of methanobacteria phylum euryarchaeota and methanosarcinia phylum halobacterota fig 6 c presents genus level data showing that the archaeal communities in both the control group and the mof 808 150 group were mainly composed of the genera methanosarcina class methanosarcinia and methanothermobacter class methanobacteria which is consistent with the corresponding phylum level and class level data indicating that these two taxonomic groups predominated in both the control group and the mof 808 150 group during the ad of sludge a careful examination of fig 6 c reveals that the average proportions of the genus methanosarcina were significantly higher in the mof 808 150 group than in the control group indicating that mof 808 enriched this genus during ad previous studies have highlighted the importance of methanosarcina to achieve more efficient methanogenesis in ad wang et al 2018a it thus can be inferred that mof 808 enhances methanosarcina related methanogenesis resulting in high methane production during the ad of sludge fig 1 the fact that the metabolic activity of the genus methanosarcina is closely associated with the process of proton translocation welte and deppenmeier 2011 suggests that the enhancement of methanosarcina related methanogenesis might be triggered by high proton transfer ability of mof 808 which can also be supported by previous study beckmann et al 2016 in all methanogenic processes of methanosarcina the reduction of the terminal electron accepting com s s cob to the com sh and cob sh by membrane bound heterodisulfide reductase enzymes is an essential process which usually accompanies with the step of proton translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane of methanogens beckmann et al 2016 it can thus be inferred that mof 808 generates a proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane of methanosarcina which facilitates the translocation of protons and thereby enhances the reduction of com s s cob to com sh and cob sh which consequently triggers more efficient methanogenesis welte and deppenmeier 2014 this explanation can also be supported by the findings of beckmann et al 2016 who found that phenazine crystals enhanced methanogenesis in methanosarcina mazei by generating a proton motive force across its cytoplasmic membrane in addition it has been clear that methanosarcina species are typical mixotrophic microorganisms that are able to produce methane by either consuming acetate or reducing co2 lin et al 2018 and methanothermobacter are typical hydrogenotrophic methanogens yan et al 2017 usually the higher the relative abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens the higher the proportion of methane in biogas from ad xu et al 2021 however in this study we found that despite the relative abundance of methanothermobacter in the mof 808 150 group being lower than that in the control group fig 6 c the proportion of methane in biogas from ad in the mof 808 150 group was higher than that in the control group fig 1 b one logical examination for this observation is that mof 808 facilitated the co2 reduction pathway of methanogenesis in methanosarcina during ad process this was further corroborated by the enrichment of syntrophic acetate oxidising bacteria which can produce h2 and co2 notably in this study the electro active bacteria e g geobacter species which can participate in diet in defined co cultures was not detected while the activity of hydrogenase which can imply the activity of hydrogen transfer between anaerobes was enhanced by mof 808 fig s5 sm this result further indicates that mof 808 strengthened the iht rather than diet to improve the co2 reduction pathway methanogenesis which is also supported by the study of zhang et al 2018 who found that the enhanced diffusion rate of dissolved proton carrier can strengthen iht pathway taken together the above findings suggest that mof 808 functions as a high performance proton conductor to accelerate proton transfer related to a traditional syntrophic process i e iht reaction 1 and enhances co2 reduction to methane thereby increasing the proportion of methane in biogas from ad of sludge 4 conclusions in this study mof 808 was first confirmed that mof 808 enhanced methane production during the ad of was moreover we showed that mof 808 enhanced the degree and rate of hydrolysis acidification of sludge substrates and optimised the functional microbe structures for hydrolysis acidification and methanation resulting in the enhancement of methane generation efficiency from was our main conclusions are as follows 1 mof 808 enhanced the methane production and methane proportion in biogas from ad of was with the addition of mof 808 the maximum methane production increased by 26 7 and the maximum methane proportion in biogas was approximately 81 2 mof 808 improved the hydrolysis degree and rate of sludge organic matters during ad by enhancing biological enzymatic hydrolysis and also by its own catalytic hydrolysis activity for example with the effect of mof 808 the activities of protease and α glucosidase during the ad process increased maximally by 68 9 and 91 2 respectively additionally the maximum proportion and the initial increasing rate of low mw organic matters increased by 60 and 583 7 via catalytic hydrolysis of mof 808 itself 3 mof 808 accelerated the bioconversion of hydrolysis acidification products i e vfas to methane during ad for example mof 808 caused a rapid increase 867 4 in the rate of consumption of acetate from day 4 to day 8 4 mof 808 promoted the proton transfer and regulated the methanogenic pathway during ad especially strengthening the reduction of co2 by enrichment of the mixotrophic methanogens i e the abundance of genus methanosarcina increased by 35 5

were operated in parallel and batch fed daily with nitrified secondary effluent after achieving a pseudo steady state through the filter columns vacuum ultraviolet treatment was applied as pre treatment or as post treatment at two different applied energies i e vuv e1 1 kwh m3 and vuv e10 10 kwh m3 once granular activated carbon had transitioned to biologically activated carbon as determined based on soluble chemical oxygen demand removal adsorption was still observed as the main mechanism for contaminants of emerging concern and nitrate removal vacuum ultraviolet pre treatment markedly improved contaminants of emerging concern removal through the integrated system achieving 40 at vuv e1 and 90 at vuv e10 when applied as post treatment to zeolite column effluents vuv e1 and vuv e10 further increased contaminants of emerging concern removal by 20 and 90 respectively in the zeolite system vacuum ultraviolet pre treatment also increased soluble chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency indicating that higher energy vacuum ultraviolet increased biodegradability total prokaryotes were two fold more abundant in biologically activated carbon than in zeolite with vacuum ultraviolet pretreatment markedly affecting microbial diversity both in terms of richness and composition media type only marginally affected microbial richness in the biofilters but showed a

treatment is gaining increasing attention as a source of water supply for addressing demands worldwide while implementation of water reuse projects in arid and semi arid regions has mostly been driven by water scarcity economic considerations have led adoption at global scale asano and cotruvo 2004 capital and operational costs associated with transport of water or implementation of desalination have often been prohibitive levine and asano 2004 rao et al 2015 as a result alternative water supply strategies leveraging potable reuse have attracted considerable interest cotruvo 2016 leverenz et al 2011 many countries have proposed water quality criteria for potable reuse however because of anthropogenic contributions to the source potable reuse should address a broad category of chemicals including pharmaceuticals hormones pesticides flame retardants perfluorinated compounds commonly referred to as contaminants of emerging concern cecs cecs are increasingly found in surface waters and wastewaters while their adverse effects on human health and the environment are still largely unknown richardson and kimura 2020 sousa et al 2018 one well established regulatory framework for cecs control is the water protection act issued by swiss federal office for the environment foen which recommends an average 80 removal of 12 selected compounds foen 2022 bourgin et al 2018 state of the art treatment for potable reuse often includes full advanced treatment fat due to its proven performance bernados 2020 gerrity et al 2013 fat includes reverse osmosis ro preceded by micro or ultra filtration followed by an advanced oxidation process aop high operational and capital costs large footprint poor response to variable water quality and complexities of brine management have challenged fat thus there has been an interest in alternate potable reuse trains including zero liquid discharge zld schemes noibi et al 2020 integration of aops following or preceeding biological processes has emerged as a viable strategy due to the potential for degrading a wide range of cecs without generating membrane concentrates piras et al 2020 pollice et al 2012 rizzo et al 2019 silva et al 2017 hooper et al 2020 these studies have demonstrated that treatment trains including o3 o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 uv o3 as pre and or post treatment to biofiltration can be as efficient as ro based treatment trains for controlling cecs properties of the biological filtration media such as grain morphology specific surface and pore sizes as well as adsorption and ion exchange capacity have been reported to play a key role in controlling biofiltration performance both in terms of cecs removal efficiency and effluent biostability lu et al 2020 synergies between adsorption and biodegradation may also take place during biofiltration for example the considerable adsorption capacity of activated carbon for organic compounds could facilitate acclimatization of biomass promoting both co metabolic degradation of cecs as well as in situ regeneration of saturated adsorption sites granular media that are typically used in biofiltration include granular activated carbon gac anthracite and sand bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 zeolites with high si al ratios have also been reported to be able to selectively adsorb and degrade a variety of cecs de ridder et al 2012 fu et al 2021 jiang et al 2018 aops have been widely applied in drinking water and potable reuse schemes with ozone and uv aop as the most common treatment options for cecs degradation however like membrane based treatment aop can also suffer from high capital and operational costs due to high doses required especially in wastewaters which have a high scavenging potential for this reason novel oxidation process based on the use of low uv wavelengths 200 nm such as vacuum uv vuv have attracted interest because they can produce oh radicals via direct water photolysis at 185 nm and reductive species such as hydrated electrons zoschke et al 2014 this combined aop and advanced reduction process arp has potential for degrading a wider range of contaminants as well as eliminating the need for externally dosed oxidants zoschke 2014 a drawback of this process is that vuv performance is strongly affected by organic and inorganic water constituents including chloride sulfate total organic carbon toc and natural organic matter nom dissolved oxygen ph and alkalinity dubowski et al 2020 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 kim et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 moreover the physico chemical properties of cecs including hydrophobicity and molecular structure may also affect vuv degradation performance kim and tanaka 2009 zhu et al 2019 further there is a potential risk of undesirable by products using short uv wavelengths such as vuv lights at 185 nm which could result in a residual toxicity rayaroth et al 2022 tufail et al 2021 despite its potential use of vuv has received limited implementation cecs removal from wastewater has been reported to be significantly lower than from natural waters kim and tanaka 2009 li et al 2011 mouamfon et al 2011 due to the presence of nom no3 hco3 and other radical scavengers it is also unclear whether vuv should be located upstream or downstream of a biological filtration process we also hypothesized that process sequence has a considerable impact on microbial communities in the biofilter which is in turn responsible for cecs biodegradation when considered individually microbial community water quality and process conditions have all been reported to affect the metabolic functionality of tertiary biofilters bacaro et al 2019 mikkelson et al 2015 nemani et al 2018 recently several studies demonstrated that taxa such as proteobacteria firmicutes and actionobacteria are capable of degrading broad classes of cecs including pharmaceuticals navrozidou et al 2019 yang et al 2020 herbicides yang et al 2020 and disinfection by products like bromate and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma hatzinger et al 2017 wang et al 2019 gerrity et al 2018 confirmed that water matrix drinking water or wastewater pre oxidation process i e ozonation and chlorination media type gac or anthracite and filter operations had a significant impact on biofiltration limited information is available on the performance of integrated vuv and biofiltration systems this research helps to fill this knowledge gap focusing on the development of a novel process based on vuv with biofiltration the objectives of this study were to i determine the optimal location of vuv either as pre or post treatment to biofiltration ii determining the optimal media for biofiltration iii elucidating cecs removal in the integrated treatment system and iv understanding changes in microbial ecology associated with use of pre treatment with vuv and its effect on microbial diversity in the biofilters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experimental setup used in this study consisted of 6 biofiltration columns three filled with gac each with 1 140 ggac and three with granular zeolite gz each with 1 650 ggz fig 1 in this study zeolite was used to compare performance of a non adsorbing media with a known adsorbent gac moreover zeolite could play an important role in removing constituents such as ammonia and other nonpolar cecs due to its ion exchange properties wang and peng 2010 wang 2020 gac in this study s i c a v spa gissi chieti italy was 4 8 us mesh size with a specific surface area b e t of 1050 m2 g and average pore diameter of 3 8 nm zeolite was purchased from kmi zeolite u s a and was a natural high purity 97 clinoptilolite with a si al ratio of 5 granules were 4 8 us mesh size with a b e t surface of 40 m2 g and a pore diameter of 4 7 å characteristics of the carrier media are summarized in tables si 1 and si 2 each column was 120 cm high with a diameter of 5 cm and a bed height of 1 m fig si 1b columns were designed to treat 0 65 l d of secondary effluent in semi batch operation with an empty bed contact time ebct of 24 h each column was fed manually with secondary effluent obtained from the greenway wastewater treatment plant wwtp in london ontario canada the choice of a long ebct 24 h was to evaluate the magnitude of expected degradation from three main mechanisms vuv aop arp physico chemical absorption ion exchange and biodegradation to compare results at 24 h ebct with previous studies kinetic tests were conducted with samples collected from minutes to hours of contact time this allowed maximization of observable differences between removal mechanisms while also providing information on process scalability at different ebcts vuv equipment was designed and integrated with a biofiltration system to achieve pre and post treatment of the secondary effluent the experimental vuv prototype consisted of an annular photoreactor 35 5 cm long with internal diameter of 4 2 cm and external diameter of 6 2 cm with an 85 w electrical low pressure mercury amalgam lamp high output amalgam pro series 602850g viquatm the lamp emitted 185 and 254 nm wavelength with a vuv185 uv254 ratio in the range of 8 12 furatian 2017 the photoreactor mounted synthetic quartz sleeve uvmax gen 2 pro 10 viquatm with transmittance at 185 nm of 75 85 based on the manufacturer specifications to control the energy applied to wastewater the vuv reactor was operated in recirculation mode using a 0 15 l s pump and a 9 5 l tank see fig si 1a the recirculation flow was set to achieve uniform energy distribution in the recirculating fluid while 254 nm was also emitted and contributed to the overall performance of the system it is reasonable to assume that the non selective hydroxyl radical reactions resulting from irradiation at 185 nm was responsible for the majority of cecs transformations with uv photolysis of cecs limited to those with very high quantum yields legrini et al 1993 the dominance of aop versus direct photolysis in secondary effluent is also favored by the lower uv transmittance of secondary wastewater effluent 80 when compared with drinking water where uv photolysis is an important degradation mechanism andreozzi et al 1999 due to the complexity in estimating vuv doses because of uncertain optical characteristics of a complex water matrix at 185 nm the investigation used specific electrical energy ee q as independent process variable ee q in kwh m3 commonly used for uv based aops ee q was calculated by dividing the lamp electrical power by the volume treated and multiplied by the exposure time therefore vuv e1 and vuv e10 correspond to an ee q of 1 kwh m3 and 10 kwh m3 respectively vuv e0 refers to untreated secondary effluent these values were selected for influent pre treatment and post treatment of granular activated carbon and granular zeolite columns effluents the behavior of some conventional contaminants i e soluble cod s cod nitrate nitrite and total dissolved organic carbon was characterized by measuring concentration as a function of the applied treatment energy up to 10 kwh m3 2 2 biofiltration mode of operation 2 2 1 pseudo steady state biofiltration column operations with vuv as post treatment all columns were operated in a daily fed batch mode with an ebct of 24 h secondary effluent from a local wwtp was fed for twenty two consecutive weeks to allow biofilm to develop biofilm developed around the filter media as well as in the media pores until a pseudo steady state condition was achieved pseudo steady state was established when stability in integral mass balances reached 5 change in conventional parameters once pseudo steady state was achieved performance of biofiltration columns was assessed using an intense sampling event hereafter referred to as intermediate sampling event ise where the above parameters were sampled daily for seven consecutive days and integral mass balances on gross parameters were conducted additionally two composite samples were generated by combining daily aliquots of biofiltered wastewater for further treatment composite samples were subjected to post treatment at two vuv energy levels referred as vuv e1 or 1 kwh m3 and vuv e10 or 10 kwh m3 2 2 2 pseudo steady state biofiltration column operations with vuv as pre treatment starting from the twenty third week of operation the feed procedure was modified so that the first column columns c1 and z1 in fig 1 served as control and continued to be fed with the untreated secondary effluent while the second columns c2 and z2 in fig 1 and the third columns c3 and z3 in fig 1 were fed with different vuv energy vuv e1 or 1 kwh m3 and vuv e10 or 10 kwh m3 respectively the goal of this phase of work was to investigate the impact of vuv pre treatment on biofiltration biofiltration columns were operated without interruption for an additional five weeks at the end of which a final sampling event fse was conducted to evaluate pseudo steady state conditions the composite included sample collection for wastewater feed and treated wastewater for 7 8 days 2 2 3 biofiltration kinetic experiments kinetic experiments were conducted using biofiltration columns at different ebcts the shortest ebct was 1 5 min 0 025 h the time needed for columns to drain by gravity with the drain valve fully open hereafter referred as quick drainage the additional ebcts investigated were obtained by halving the longests ebct 24 h resulting in a series of 0 375 0 750 1 500 3 000 6 000 12 000 and 24 000 h 2 3 breakthrough adsorption tests on biofiltering media the adsorptive capacity of virgin gac and zeolite for conventional contaminants i e soluble cod and nitrate and cecs was determined by assessing breakthrough in two miniature columns each with a working volume of 65 ml and a diameter of 2 cm containing 36 7 g gac and 52 0 g zeolite due to the similar particle size distribution columns were operated at a continuous flow of 1 4 ml min corresponding to a residence time of 45 min about 83 bed volumes bvs and 31 bvs of secondary effluent were treated in the gac and zeolite respectively approximately 150 ml of sample was collected for every 500 ml of treated influent 75 ml before and 75 ml after the target volume the relationship between bvs and treatment time is provided in fig si 2 breakthrough data and equipment details are shown in figs si 3 and si 4 and in table si 3 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 conventional parameters conventional parameters were measured once a week

described in supporting information text si 1 total organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon doc were measured during two sampling events for composite samples samples were collected shipped and measured at the brown and caldwell treatability testing laboratory in nashville tennessee usa a sievers m531oc suez usa toc analyzer was used according to standard method 5310c persulfate ultraviolet or heated persulfate oxidation method for doc analysis samples were filtered with 0 45 µm polyethersulfone syringe filters fisher scientific usa all samples were transferred to 40 ml amber glass voa vials with ptfe lined silicone septa fischer scientific usa and acidified with 6m phosphoric acid solution to reduce ph to 2 then combined with 15 ammonium persulfate measured concentrations including cecs and prokaryotes are provided with standard deviation denoted as 2 4 2 contaminants of emerging concern the analytical methodology implemented for the detection and quantification of cecs followed the method reported in another study montagna et al 2020 and is described in text si 2 2 5 microbial ecology measurements to characterize and quantify biomass attached to media filtration media were sampled from the top and bottom portions of the filter beds second after manually shaking of the biomass associated with media the liquid phase was collected by passing the mixture of fluid and grains through a sieve thus generating a dispersed sample which was paired to the granular sample biomass from the granular sample was obtained following an extraction procedure involving sonication as described in text si 3 samples were stored at 4 c and shipped to the microbial ecology lab institut de recherche et de développement en agroenvironnement irda for analysis in addition aliquots of raw and vuv treated vuv e1 and vuv e10 secondary effluents were sampled and submitted to the same laboratory preparation of amplicon libraries and bioinformatic analyses of sequences were conducted at the laboratory of microbial ecology of irda quebec qc canada illumina miseq 2 300 bp sequencing was performed by the genomic analysis platform of the institute for integrative biology and systems ibis at laval university quebec qc canada details of the procedure are reported in text si 3 the structure of prokaryotic communities was assessed in terms of richness α diversity and of composition β diversity of microbes amplicon sequence variant asv counts were compared with chao1 index to estimate species richness to support evaluation of rare species the shannon index was assessed to account for asv richness and evenness β diversity was assessed based on the taxonomic characterization at phylum level which was determined by computing the relative abundance of each microbe detected in each sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of biofiltration system performance 3 1 1 feed characterization conventional water quality parameters for untreated secondary effluent feed are summarized in table 1 data reflect all samples collected during the twenty seven week experimental period overall data confirm good quality of secondary effluent consistent with a well functioning conventional activated sludge plants achieving full nitrification total cod averaged 26 mg l nitrates accounted for more than 99 of total nitrogen with low ammonia and nitrite concentrations toc ranged from 5 17 5 67 mg l with respect to cecs targeted screening by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms allowed identification and quantification of twenty nine cecs table 2 concentrations of cecs ranged from 0 02 to 2 1 µg l with total cecs computed as the sum of individual cecs total cecs was used as a surrogate parameter to assess performance of the system total cecs in secondary effluent was 9 27 0 45 µg l with 8 of the 12 indicator substances in the swiss regulations foen 2022 detected table 2 cecs relevant to swiss regulation were benzotriazole carbamazepine citalopram clarithromycin diclofenac irbesartan metoprolol and venlafaxine the sum of cecs concentrations total cecsw averaged 2 94 0 29 µg l 3 1 2 gac system performance of the gac control column was assessed for the removal of conventional contaminants by computing integrated mass balances over multiple sampling days 7 and 8 respectively for intermediate and final sampling events the slopes obtained from the cumulative masses computed at the inlet and outlet of the biofiltration column c1 as a function of the sampling period were utilized to estimate efficiency of s cod and nitrate removal fig 2 s cod removal efficiency 90 were obtained and did not change during the 27 week experimental period conversely nitrate removal efficiency progressively decreased over time from 58 at intermediate sampling bvs 50 to 38 at the second sampling event bvs 60 ammonia which was already low in the influent was completely removed by biofiltration while total and soluble phosphorus removals were 60 and not appreciably different between the ise and fse fig si 5 toc was degraded with efficiencies 99 as shown by experimental data after both intermediate and final sampling events with effluent concentrations of 4 µg l well below the most stringent limit for potable reuse in california 0 5 mg l u s environmental protection agency 2018 breakthrough in the miniature column tests for virgin carbon indicated that s cod and nitrate were initially adsorbed onto gac and reached more than 90 saturation 60 bvs indicating exhaustion of capacity at 80 bvs fig si 3 by plotting breakthrough curves for virgin material with the biofiltration column performance using bvs as x axis fig 3 it can be concluded that nitrate reduction was driven by adsorption fig 3 a while reduction of s cod was driven by biological reactions fig 3 b this is consistent with observations of peterson and summers 2021 and confirms that gac had transitioned to biological activated carbon bac to elucidate the removal mechanisms in the biofiltration columns kinetic tests were conducted at different contact times these experiments were conducted on columns operated at ebct 24 h kinetic tests reflect the behavior of biofiltration at steady state for a fixed ebct of 24 h as shown in fig 4 s cod concentration normalized over the concentration of raw secondary effluent was linear as a function of contact time when log transformed suggesting that a power law could suitably fit experimental observations r2 0 65 the log log behaviour of observed data can be explained by considering the co occurrence of first order degradation kinetics linearizing with a y axis in log scale with diffusion limited absorption dominated removal mechanisms linearizing with x axis in log scale the quick drainage experiment removed 35 of s cod with an additional 43 removal occurring within the following 22 5 min no further improvement was observed after 45 min while 90 removal was achieved in 180 min with the remaining 10 being removed after 720 min considering that 43 bvs were treated in the column at the time of the kinetic test and the residual gac absorption capacity was 20 s cod as determined by the minicolumn test the removal during quick drainage experiment was adsorption particularly given the short ebct however the biological contributions were relevant at ebcts 45 min in agreement with peterson and summers 2021 who found that ebcts 45 60 min are needed by bac biofilters to efficiently remove effluent organic matter similar behavior was also observed in the second kinetic test at 60 bvs when removal by quick drainage was halved with respect to the previous test while the incremental s cod abatement within 22 5 min accounted for 47 at 45 min ebct removal efficiency was 72 with an effluent s cod concentration below the value estimated by the breakthrough test at the same ebct additionally after 22 5 min ebct the removal efficiency increased by 6 8 by doubling ebct up to 360 min and then by quadrupling ebct to 24 h indicating that biological activity was boosting s cod removal at ebcts 45 min with respect to cecs breakthrough tests showed that adsorption of cecs did not correlate with adsorption of s cod fig si 3 at 80 bvs the residual cecs adsorptive capacity was 80 while media was saturated with s cod suggesting that cecs adsorption may occur longer than s cod adsorption this is confirmed by the kinetic tests fig 4 as the total cecs removal rate r2 0 99 was higher than that for s cod removal with 70 of total cecs being removed during quick drainage experiments and 98 removal being reached within 22 5 min ebct fig 4 the high residual adsorption capacity of gac for cecs and the very short times involved for removal infers that biodegradation assessed at short ebcts in this study was not a significant contributor to removal of cecs as expected no cecs were detected in bac column effluent during the fse cecs removal was not assessed after the ise this result demonstrates that biological removal of bulk organic matter was prolonging gac life allowing it to harness residual adsorption capacity for cecs removal ultimately gac columns were operating as bac filters and effluents were compliant with the most stringent regulations for toc in potable reuse as established by california only nitrate which should not exceed the drinking water national maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 mg l national primary water regulation https www epa gov ground water and drinking water national primary drinking water regulations was of concern in addition ebcts between 45 min and 90 min were needed to achieve 80 removal of s cod and 98 cecs abatement 1 7 log removal which together may be considered for addressing potable water quality standards 3 1 3 zeolite system all the procedures used to assess gac columns were conducted in parallel for gz columns under identical operating conditions breakthrough tests for virgin zeolite revealed no adsorption capacity for s cod nitrate and nitrite with a weak adsorption observed for s p fig si 4 in the case of total cecs breakthrough occurred quickly reaching saturation at about 20 bvs fig si 4 consequently at the time of both sampling events and kinetic tests the adsorption capacity for conventional pollutants and cecs was already exhausted except for ammonia which was removed mostly due to ion exchange as expected from breakthrough tests the gz system did not remove nitrates however integrated mass balances revealed that control column z1 preserved its performance in abating s cod between the two sampling events about 40 removal was measured at the end of both ise and fse fig si 6 and considering the inability of zeolite to adsorb s cod biological mechanisms were assumed to be responsible for bulk organic matter removal phosphorus removal was negligible at the end of ise while 37 of t p and 20 of s p were abated at the end of experiments interestingly the gz control column removed 65 and 43 of toc after ise and fse respectively although higher than allowed by california regulations for potable reuse 0 5 mg l toc concentrations in the effluent from the gz control column was 2 93 mg l which is compliant with guidance for potable reuse in most other us states for example in florida toc must be 3 mg l u s environmental protection agency 2018 when the s cod removal of the zeolite biofiltration column control with no vuv pre treatment was assessed over time fig 5 the removal was less pronounced than observed in the bac column at 43 bvs s cod removal reached 45 after 24 h fig 5 the same kinetic test repeated at 60 bvs indicated a drop in s cod removal efficiency with only 37 biodegraded at 24 h ebct kinetic tests showed that total cecs removal followed s cod removal trends fig 5 cecs abatement reached 46 after 24 h ebct when considered individually 7 cecs were not detected in the effluent of column z1 after fse i e atv ctp cla fba lvfx los and mpa indicating these compounds were more biodegradable or better retained by ion exchange interestingly of the 12 substances in the swiss regulation only ctp and cla were detected in the effluent and removed by 21 substantial removal was observed for eedp and stg 82 and 92 respectively a group of cecs including dcf stl atl and tlm were removed from 50 70 while ctz mtp mtf irb vlx removal ranged from 25 50 all other compounds were not removed by zeolite biofiltration overall although clearly inferior to bac zeolite demonstrated a measurable removal of cecs ebcts for zeolite biofiltration between 45 90 min only achieved s cod and total cecs removals 10 which is too low for potable reuse necessitating longer ebcts to reach 40 removal 6 to 12 h 3 2 evaluation of the effects of vuv as pre and post treatment 3 2 1 impact of vuv treatment on conventional pollutants the treatment of secondary effluent using vuv showed as expected different performance depending on energy applied cod as well as toc doc and nitrates exhibited weak removal with a linear decrease with increasing vuv treatment energy fig 6 a c at vuv e1 1 kwh m3 average removal efficiencies were 11 for s cod 8 for toc and doc and 4 for nitrate at vuv e10 10 kwh m3 s cod was reduced on average by 20 toc and doc by 15 and nitrate by only 10 no effect was observed on phosphorus conversely formation of nitrite via reaction of nitrate with solvated electrons and hydrogen ions produced by water photolysis was not negligible with concentrations after treatment at vuv e1 and vuv e10 of 50 times initial concentrations fig 6 d similar effects on conventional contaminants were observed when applying vuv as post treatment to gac and gz effluents it is also interesting to note that when nitrite formation was normalized by initial nitrate concentrations both influent and effluent kinetic profiles overlapped confirming a stochiometric conversion between precursor nitrate and photoproduct nitrite as a function of the vuv energy applied fig si 7 this highlights the importance of the formation of photoproducts with vuv as the final treatment process to avoid exceedance of nitrite limits in the treated water for example california and florida rules stipulate a limit of 1 mg l as nitrite nitrogen u s environmental protection agency 2018 a limit met under post treatment by vuv e1 or 1 kw m3 from both bac effluent nitrite of 0 2 mg l and gz effluent nitrite of 0 4 mg l but exceeded at high vuv energies vuv e10 or 10 kw m3 3 2 2 impact of vuv treatment on biofiltration system performance the impact of vuv pre treatment on performance of both gac and gz biofilters was assessed based on integrated mass balances computed over the 8 days of the fse 27th week table 3 summarizes tertiary biofilter performance with and without vuv pre treatment with respect to conventional contaminants performance of gac filters c2 and c3 for cod removal total and soluble was similar to control column c1 with an efficiency 90 i e no significant impact of vuv pre treatment was observed effluent toc concentrations were below the california limit for potable reuse 0 5 mg l and ammonia was absent in all biofilter effluents interestingly nitrite removal efficiencies of 95 and 99 respectively were measured in columns c2 and c3 higher than the control column c1 63 this demonstrated the increase in nitrite due to vuv pre treatment did not adversely affect removal efficiency total and soluble p removal efficiencies were 65 and 55 respectively with no impact of vuv pre treatment in the zeolite system cod removal increased linearly from column z1 to z3 with the s cod reduction ranging from 40 in z1 to 55 in z2 and 60 in z3 toc and doc removals in columns z2 and z3 were consistent with cod reductions and although effluent toc concentrations exceeded the stringent california limit for potable reuse 0 5 mgtoc l they met criteria used in other us states for groundwater recharge e g florida u s environmental protection agency 2018 this suggests that vuv pre treatment impact on water matrix biodegradability increased with increasing treatment energy kinetic tests at different contact times revealed that in columns z2 only 17 removal was achieved in 90 min ebct although double compared to the 8 at the same contact time in column z1 in addition 45 removal was observed within 720 min 8 higher than in column z1 at the same ebct in the case of column z3 efficiencies of 25 and 50 were achieved at ebcts of 90 and 180 min confirming that pre treatment at a high energy contributed to reducing the ebct to reach at 50 removal of bulk organic matter in zeolite biofilters as expected ammonia was absent in all gz effluents due to ion exchange adam et al 2019 karri et al 2018 while nitrate was not removed phosphorus removal was lower in comparison with gac columns at about 37 and 20 for total and soluble p respectively these findings demonstrated that the choice of appropriate carrier media i e gac or gz is crucial to optimally integrate biofiltration with vuv for potential potable reuse schemes 3 2 3 impact of vuv treatment on cecs the effects of treatment energy on cecs abatement during pre treatment of the secondary effluent were evident at low treatment energy vuv e1 7 compounds atv cbze dcf fba los mpa and stl were completely transformed while increasing treatment energy by an order of magnitude eliminated an additional 12 compounds cbz cbdz ctz ctp cla lvfx lid mtp mtpa olm tmd and vlx table si 4 among the 10 remaining compounds measured atl bta eddp fcn irb ltg stg tlm were removed with efficiencies ranging from 81 to 98 while the most recalcitrant mtf and fcz were removed by 54 and 57 respectively by analogy considering the criteria adopted by swiss regulation for secondary effluents low treatment energy eliminated dcf while the other 11 compounds on the swiss shortlist of indicators were abated with efficiencies well above 80 both individually and on average at high treatment energy overall vuv pre treatment at low treatment energy reduced initial total cecs load by 41 0 23 log removal while the highest treatment energy resulted in 90 removal 1 log removal as expected pre treatment of the feed impacted performance of gac and gz biofilters differently no cecs were detected in the effluent of the gac control column due to fast adsorption the same behavior was observed in c2 and c3 columns accentuated by the fact that the initial total cecs load was reduced the fact that vuv transforms a significant aliquot of cecs from secondary effluent especially at high energy level may suggest that pre treatment could prolong the life of activated carbon by enhancing cecs removal this was confirmed by kinetic tests at different ebcts fig 7 which revealed residual concentrations decreased with increasing pre treatment energy additionally the incremental total cecs concentration removed corresponded to the distance between the breakthrough concentration without pre treatment yellow circle in fig 7 and the concentration achieved with pre treatment which increased with the vuv energy regardless of the vuv pre treatment 98 of the total cecs removal occurred in each column within 22 5 min ebct at almost the same rate demonstrating the main mechanism of cecs removal was adsorption it is worth noting that pre treatment at vuv e10 increased the removal of total cecs in column c3 from 1 to 2 log removal at the same ebct with respect to column c1 due to the complete removal of cecs by gac filters post treatment did not lead to further performance improvements while more research is needed to conclusively develop optimal treatment trains involving vuv and gac it is possible to conclude that treatment consisting of vuv as a pre treatment at energy density of e1 or 1 kw m3 followed by gac facilitates excellent removal of cecs and toc exceeding the quality stipulated by the most stringent regulations for potable reuse in the case of the gz system pre treatment at different energy levels resulted in shifts of total cecs decay rates when column z2 and z3 were tested at different ebcts fig si 8 in comparison with the control column z1 however the removal efficiency increased after 45 min in contrast to removal of s cod indicating that pre treatment markedly reduced the ebct needed to degrade cecs probably due to the partial oxidation and photolysis of cecs mixture performance of the gz columns with vuv post treatment in relationship to total cecs clearly identifies treatment schemes capable of achieving 80 removal of the initial total cecs fig 8 pre treatment at the highest treatment energy met the threshold of 80 removal efficiency of cecs while succeeding biofiltration did not contribute to additional cecs removal post treatment improved abatement to 1 8 log removal at vuv e10 and 80 removal was also achieved by pre treatment at vuv e1 followed by biofiltration with post treatment at vuv e1 vuv e1 bfgz vuv e1 further post treatment at vuv e10 increased cecs removal by more than 1 2 log another treatment train capable of achieving 80 removal as requested by the swiss regulation of total cecs was biofiltration with no pre treatment of the feed followed by post treatment at vuv e10 bfgz vuv e10 this has been also observed for total cecsw and it is worth noting that biofilter z1 alone reduced total cecs by 40 while biofilter z2 achieved an additional 30 over vuv i e with vuv pretreatment at the low energy level and biofiltration for a 70 reduction in total cecs among these combinations fig 8 the treatment train with vuv as a pre treatment at energy density of e1 or 1 kw m3 followed by zeolite biofiltration at ebct of 24 h and post treated with vuv at energy density of e1 or 1 kw m3 denoted as vuv e1 bfgz vuv e1 was the most promising zld option when zeolite were used as biofiltration media indeed although higher doses 10 kwh m3 could further enhance the cecs removal performance the higher electrical cost and the potential formation of nitrite and other photoproducts could be an issue finally it is interesting to analyze the differential removals for cecs when aggregated by molecular weights mws three classes were defined for this purpose with 9 compounds in class mw1 100 mw 267 including atl bta cbdz cbz cbze lid ltg mtf mtp 10 compounds in class mw2 267 mw 350 including ctp dcf eddp fba fcz mpa mtpa stl tmd vlx and the other 10 in class mw3 350 mw 750 including atv cla ctz fcn irb los lvfx olm stg tlm fig 9 clearly shows the impact of each treatment on the removal by mw class specifically treatment performance increases with mw indicating that large mw compounds are easier to transform than smaller compounds this may justify the use of higher vuv energy to ensure removal efficiencies greater than 80 irrespective of mw with respect to biofiltration column z1 without pre treatment did not remove compounds in class mw1 darkest shade of red color in fig 9 while the efficiency reached 57 for compounds in class mw2 increasing until 77 for compounds in class mw3 this indicated that higher mw are better removed in zeolite media similar trends were observed in columns z2 and z3 although with higher removals due to vuv pre treatment demonstrating that vuv pre treatment had a role in removal of high mw complete removal of compounds in class mw2 and mw3 were observed at vuv e10 details on the removal of individual cecs by the zeolite system are provided in text si 4 3 3 characterization of microbial compositional diversity in biofilters high quality of dna extraction was confirmed by the a260 a280 absorbance ratio of 1 8 glasel 1995 biomass quantification revealed that total prokaryotes were 2 fold more abundant in bac columns than in zeolite columns t test at 95 confidence level p 0 0033 suggesting that activated carbon favored biomass development in addition the amount of prokaryotes in dispersed samples was about 2 2 65 times higher than in granular samples in gac and in gz samples respectively this indicates a loosely attached biofilm tending to easily detach manual shaking in the gac system the average total prokaryote concentrations in the granular and dispersed samples were 5 0 107 1 2 107 au g and 1 0 108 4 8 107 au ml respectively compared to 2 0 107 7 8 106 au g and 5 3 107 1 4 107 au ml in the gz system total prokaryotes in column influents were 3 1 106 9 9 104 au ml 4 3 106 9 1 105 au ml and 3 3 106 3 1 105 au ml in secondary effluent and pre treated aliquots at vuv e1 and vuv e10 respectively total prokaryotes appeared to remain almost unchanged after vuv treatment this can be explained by the inability of the dna method to distinguish between live and dead organisms i e upon die off the release of cellular contents microorganisms can occur overall biomass concentrations in dispersed samples based on au ml was one order of magnitude higher than in the corresponding feed with respect to α diversity the good agreement between asv with chao1 index indicated the goodness of prediction of less abundant species based on shannon index analyses it was also observed that richness within columns was marginally influenced by media type although it was more pronounced in zeolite columns and that vuv pre treatment did not impact microbial diversity no clear relationship with column depth was observed a detailed discussion on shannon index analysis is provided in text si 5 all prokaryotes identified belonged to bacteria and archaea kingdoms with bacteria predominating 90 characteristics of the most abundant communities are presented in table si 5 while the taxonomic composition of secondary effluent before and after vuv pre treatment and of gac and gz biofilters is summarized in fig si 9 proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum 56 in untreated secondary effluent followed by bacteroidetes 31 and actinobacteria 4 which together accounted for 91 of the total microbes the remaining 9 of microorganisms included verrucomicrobia 2 parcubacteria 1 6 firmicutes 1 1 and a great variety of phyla with relative abundance lower than 1 including planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes chlorobi uncultured bacteria acidobacteria and nitrospirae only 0 1 this composition is consistent with published wastewater microbial characterization fang et al 2018 gerrity et al 2018 guarin and pagilla 2021 osunmakinde et al 2019 wu et al 2019 in agreement with the α diversity metric vuv pre treatment of secondary effluent at low energy vuv e1 dramatically decreased community diversity in a way that proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria together accounted for 98 of the entire microbial distribution the higher treatment energy vuv e10 achieved a drastic reduction of bacteroidetes while proteobacteria was more resistant to treatment becoming almost the unique consortium 99 in highly pre treated feed these findings highlight how vuv pre treatment selectively inactivates taxa based on their sensitivities to vuv uv light impacting microbial ecology in absolute and relative abundance with respect to the biofiltration system it was observed that proteobacteria remained the most abundant phylum in both gac and gz biofilters accounting for more than 50 on average except for granular zeolite which showed about 40 to elucidate the compositional diversity of bac and zeolite biofilters β diversity was assessed by computing the chi square distance chi 2 as proximity measures text si 6 usually chi 2 is computed utilizing relative abundance data and captures differences in the relative composition of samples often called the shape of samples rather than size of samples greenacre 2017 because the size of bac samples was higher than zeolite samples because biomass concentrations were two times higher in bac than in zeolite biofilters chi 2 was chosen to assess compositional dissimilarities principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted to map chi 2 metrics and results are presented in fig 10 where dissimilarities distances between dots were observed between bac and zeolite samples indicating material type had an impact on the microbial structure in biofilters some species like gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria and thaumarchaeota thrived more in zeolite biofilters average abundance of 3 3 5 1 and 6 9 respectively than in bac average abundance of 1 2 1 5 and 0 01 respectively while ta06 bacteria were found only in bac samples albeit at low concentration average relative abundance of 0 5 additionally differences between dispersed and granular samples which were more pronounced in the bac samples confirmed that some species tended to detach while others exhibited a more attached lifestyle for example the relative abundance of bacteroidetes was 4 6 and 4 0 on average in attached bac and zeolite samples respectively compared to 9 4 and 8 0 doubled in dispersed samples demonstrating a tendency to detach from both materials on the contrary planctomycetes showed relative abundance of 9 5 and 11 0 in attached bac and zeolite samples respectively which decreased to 6 4 and 7 1 in dispersed bac and zeolite samples exhibiting a more pronounced attached lifestyle similarly gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria and thaumarchaeota were more abundant in attached samples than in dispersed samples suggesting that they thrive as attached biomass in the bac system the scarcity of ta06 in dispersed samples could suggest these microbes exist as attached biomass the presence of the anaerobic heterotroph woesearchaeota which probably gained richness in a symbiotic metabolism with ta06 implies co operation with other microbes similarly to the superphylum asgardarchaeota huang et al 2019 macleod et al 2019 compositional structure was not clearly affected by the depth of sampling fig 10 as observed with α diversity vuv energy markedly influenced β diversity in the influent to columns although this did not have a clear impact on the compositional structure of biofilters considering that pre treatment of the feed lasted only 5 weeks the possibility that bac and zeolite systems change their internal β diversity within a longer timeframe cannot be excluded overall it can be concluded that differences in microbial structure between bac and zeolite biofilters emerged with β diversity metrics and this was confirmed by taxonomic classifications thaumarchaeota was the most abundant new phylum in zeolite biofilters thaumarchaeota together with gemmatimonadetes and acidobacteria thrived in the attached biofilm on the zeolite media due to the broad heterogeneity in richness and composition at genus level and considering the different mechanisms in organic matter and cecs degradation it is difficult to correlate the presence and abundance of specific taxa to the abatement of cecs however the prevalence of thaumarchaeota acidobacteria and gemmatimonadetes in the zeolite columns relative to bac could suggest these taxa might have had a role in degrading cecs biologically 4 summary and conclusions the integration of a vuv based aop with gac zeolite biofilters as pre and post treatment was studied in a laboratory scale system the impact of vuv energy dose and biofiltration media on microbial ecology was also assessed based on the findings of this study the following conclusions can be made at the end of the experimental period 60 bvs when gac transitioned to bac based on s cod removal adsorption was the main mechanism for cecs and nitrate removal in all combinations tested in this study gac based biofiltration outperformed zeolite based biofiltration more specifically pre treatment at energy density vuv e1 electrical energy applied of 1 kw m3 followed by gac proved excellent removal of cecs and toc exceeding the most stringent regulations for potable reuse among the tested combinations involving zeolite biofiltration vuv e1 electrical energy applied of 1 kw m3 employed as a pre treatment of the secondary effluent and post treatment of zeolite biofiltered effluent allowed to remove 80 of total cecs and to reduce toc to values below florida limit for potable reuse of 3 mg l this indicates the possibility of employing granular media not requiring regeneration in biofiltration applications for potable reuse vuv alone as pre treatment markedly degraded cecs achieving 40 cecs removal at vuv e1 electrical energy applied of 1 kw m3 and 90 at vuv e10 electrical energy applied of 10 kw m3 vuv treatment favored the transformation of large molecular weight into low molecular weight compounds both showing different biodegradation and absorption properties when subjected to biofiltration when applied as post treatment to zeolite effluents vuv e1 electrical energy applied of 1 kw m3 and vuv e10 electrical energy applied of 10 kw m3 further increased cecs removal by 20 and 90 respectively in the zeolite system vuv pre treatment also increased s cod removal efficiency indicating that higher treatment energy increased biodegradability total prokaryotes were 2 fold more abundant in granular carbon than zeolite columns with vuv treatment markedly affecting microbial diversity both in terms of richness and composition carrier media type only marginally affected microbial richness in the

15823,this study explored process synergies attainable by integrating a vacuum ultraviolet based advanced oxidation process with biofiltration a comparison using granular activated carbon or granular zeolite as filtration media were examined in context of advanced wastewater treatment for potable reuse six biofiltration columns three with granular activated carbon and three with granular zeolite were operated in parallel and batch fed daily with nitrified secondary effluent after achieving a pseudo steady state through the filter columns vacuum ultraviolet treatment was applied as pre treatment or as post treatment at two different applied energies i e vuv e1 1 kwh m3 and vuv e10 10 kwh m3 once granular activated carbon had transitioned to biologically activated carbon as determined based on soluble chemical oxygen demand removal adsorption was still observed as the main mechanism for contaminants of emerging concern and nitrate removal vacuum ultraviolet pre treatment markedly improved contaminants of emerging concern removal through the integrated system achieving 40 at vuv e1 and 90 at vuv e10 when applied as post treatment to zeolite column effluents vuv e1 and vuv e10 further increased contaminants of emerging concern removal by 20 and 90 respectively in the zeolite system vacuum ultraviolet pre treatment also increased soluble chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency indicating that higher energy vacuum ultraviolet increased biodegradability total prokaryotes were two fold more abundant in biologically activated carbon than in zeolite with vacuum ultraviolet pretreatment markedly affecting microbial diversity both in terms of richness and composition media type only marginally affected microbial richness in the biofilters but showed a

treatment is gaining increasing attention as a source of water supply for addressing demands worldwide while implementation of water reuse projects in arid and semi arid regions has mostly been driven by water scarcity economic considerations have led adoption at global scale asano and cotruvo 2004 capital and operational costs associated with transport of water or implementation of desalination have often been prohibitive levine and asano 2004 rao et al 2015 as a result alternative water supply strategies leveraging potable reuse have attracted considerable interest cotruvo 2016 leverenz et al 2011 many countries have proposed water quality criteria for potable reuse however because of anthropogenic contributions to the source potable reuse should address a broad category of chemicals including pharmaceuticals hormones pesticides flame retardants perfluorinated compounds commonly referred to as contaminants of emerging concern cecs cecs are increasingly found in surface waters and wastewaters while their adverse effects on human health and the environment are still largely unknown richardson and kimura 2020 sousa et al 2018 one well established regulatory framework for cecs control is the water protection act issued by swiss federal office for the environment foen which recommends an average 80 removal of 12 selected compounds foen 2022 bourgin et al 2018 state of the art treatment for potable reuse often includes full advanced treatment fat due to its proven performance bernados 2020 gerrity et al 2013 fat includes reverse osmosis ro preceded by micro or ultra filtration followed by an advanced oxidation process aop high operational and capital costs large footprint poor response to variable water quality and complexities of brine management have challenged fat thus there has been an interest in alternate potable reuse trains including zero liquid discharge zld schemes noibi et al 2020 integration of aops following or preceeding biological processes has emerged as a viable strategy due to the potential for degrading a wide range of cecs without generating membrane concentrates piras et al 2020 pollice et al 2012 rizzo et al 2019 silva et al 2017 hooper et al 2020 these studies have demonstrated that treatment trains including o3 o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 uv o3 as pre and or post treatment to biofiltration can be as efficient as ro based treatment trains for controlling cecs properties of the biological filtration media such as grain morphology specific surface and pore sizes as well as adsorption and ion exchange capacity have been reported to play a key role in controlling biofiltration performance both in terms of cecs removal efficiency and effluent biostability lu et al 2020 synergies between adsorption and biodegradation may also take place during biofiltration for example the considerable adsorption capacity of activated carbon for organic compounds could facilitate acclimatization of biomass promoting both co metabolic degradation of cecs as well as in situ regeneration of saturated adsorption sites granular media that are typically used in biofiltration include granular activated carbon gac anthracite and sand bourgin et al 2018 hollender et al 2009 zeolites with high si al ratios have also been reported to be able to selectively adsorb and degrade a variety of cecs de ridder et al 2012 fu et al 2021 jiang et al 2018 aops have been widely applied in drinking water and potable reuse schemes with ozone and uv aop as the most common treatment options for cecs degradation however like membrane based treatment aop can also suffer from high capital and operational costs due to high doses required especially in wastewaters which have a high scavenging potential for this reason novel oxidation process based on the use of low uv wavelengths 200 nm such as vacuum uv vuv have attracted interest because they can produce oh radicals via direct water photolysis at 185 nm and reductive species such as hydrated electrons zoschke et al 2014 this combined aop and advanced reduction process arp has potential for degrading a wider range of contaminants as well as eliminating the need for externally dosed oxidants zoschke 2014 a drawback of this process is that vuv performance is strongly affected by organic and inorganic water constituents including chloride sulfate total organic carbon toc and natural organic matter nom dissolved oxygen ph and alkalinity dubowski et al 2020 imoberdorf and mohseni 2011 kim et al 2015 zhu et al 2019 moreover the physico chemical properties of cecs including hydrophobicity and molecular structure may also affect vuv degradation performance kim and tanaka 2009 zhu et al 2019 further there is a potential risk of undesirable by products using short uv wavelengths such as vuv lights at 185 nm which could result in a residual toxicity rayaroth et al 2022 tufail et al 2021 despite its potential use of vuv has received limited implementation cecs removal from wastewater has been reported to be significantly lower than from natural waters kim and tanaka 2009 li et al 2011 mouamfon et al 2011 due to the presence of nom no3 hco3 and other radical scavengers it is also unclear whether vuv should be located upstream or downstream of a biological filtration process we also hypothesized that process sequence has a considerable impact on microbial communities in the biofilter which is in turn responsible for cecs biodegradation when considered individually microbial community water quality and process conditions have all been reported to affect the metabolic functionality of tertiary biofilters bacaro et al 2019 mikkelson et al 2015 nemani et al 2018 recently several studies demonstrated that taxa such as proteobacteria firmicutes and actionobacteria are capable of degrading broad classes of cecs including pharmaceuticals navrozidou et al 2019 yang et al 2020 herbicides yang et al 2020 and disinfection by products like bromate and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma hatzinger et al 2017 wang et al 2019 gerrity et al 2018 confirmed that water matrix drinking water or wastewater pre oxidation process i e ozonation and chlorination media type gac or anthracite and filter operations had a significant impact on biofiltration limited information is available on the performance of integrated vuv and biofiltration systems this research helps to fill this knowledge gap focusing on the development of a novel process based on vuv with biofiltration the objectives of this study were to i determine the optimal location of vuv either as pre or post treatment to biofiltration ii determining the optimal media for biofiltration iii elucidating cecs removal in the integrated treatment system and iv understanding changes in microbial ecology associated with use of pre treatment with vuv and its effect on microbial diversity in the biofilters 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experimental setup used in this study consisted of 6 biofiltration columns three filled with gac each with 1 140 ggac and three with granular zeolite gz each with 1 650 ggz fig 1 in this study zeolite was used to compare performance of a non adsorbing media with a known adsorbent gac moreover zeolite could play an important role in removing constituents such as ammonia and other nonpolar cecs due to its ion exchange properties wang and peng 2010 wang 2020 gac in this study s i c a v spa gissi chieti italy was 4 8 us mesh size with a specific surface area b e t of 1050 m2 g and average pore diameter of 3 8 nm zeolite was purchased from kmi zeolite u s a and was a natural high purity 97 clinoptilolite with a si al ratio of 5 granules were 4 8 us mesh size with a b e t surface of 40 m2 g and a pore diameter of 4 7 å characteristics of the carrier media are summarized in tables si 1 and si 2 each column was 120 cm high with a diameter of 5 cm and a bed height of 1 m fig si 1b columns were designed to treat 0 65 l d of secondary effluent in semi batch operation with an empty bed contact time ebct of 24 h each column was fed manually with secondary effluent obtained from the greenway wastewater treatment plant wwtp in london ontario canada the choice of a long ebct 24 h was to evaluate the magnitude of expected degradation from three main mechanisms vuv aop arp physico chemical absorption ion exchange and biodegradation to compare results at 24 h ebct with previous studies kinetic tests were conducted with samples collected from minutes to hours of contact time this allowed maximization of observable differences between removal mechanisms while also providing information on process scalability at different ebcts vuv equipment was designed and integrated with a biofiltration system to achieve pre and post treatment of the secondary effluent the experimental vuv prototype consisted of an annular photoreactor 35 5 cm long with internal diameter of 4 2 cm and external diameter of 6 2 cm with an 85 w electrical low pressure mercury amalgam lamp high output amalgam pro series 602850g viquatm the lamp emitted 185 and 254 nm wavelength with a vuv185 uv254 ratio in the range of 8 12 furatian 2017 the photoreactor mounted synthetic quartz sleeve uvmax gen 2 pro 10 viquatm with transmittance at 185 nm of 75 85 based on the manufacturer specifications to control the energy applied to wastewater the vuv reactor was operated in recirculation mode using a 0 15 l s pump and a 9 5 l tank see fig si 1a the recirculation flow was set to achieve uniform energy distribution in the recirculating fluid while 254 nm was also emitted and contributed to the overall performance of the system it is reasonable to assume that the non selective hydroxyl radical reactions resulting from irradiation at 185 nm was responsible for the majority of cecs transformations with uv photolysis of cecs limited to those with very high quantum yields legrini et al 1993 the dominance of aop versus direct photolysis in secondary effluent is also favored by the lower uv transmittance of secondary wastewater effluent 80 when compared with drinking water where uv photolysis is an important degradation mechanism andreozzi et al 1999 due to the complexity in estimating vuv doses because of uncertain optical characteristics of a complex water matrix at 185 nm the investigation used specific electrical energy ee q as independent process variable ee q in kwh m3 commonly used for uv based aops ee q was calculated by dividing the lamp electrical power by the volume treated and multiplied by the exposure time therefore vuv e1 and vuv e10 correspond to an ee q of 1 kwh m3 and 10 kwh m3 respectively vuv e0 refers to untreated secondary effluent these values were selected for influent pre treatment and post treatment of granular activated carbon and granular zeolite columns effluents the behavior of some conventional contaminants i e soluble cod s cod nitrate nitrite and total dissolved organic carbon was characterized by measuring concentration as a function of the applied treatment energy up to 10 kwh m3 2 2 biofiltration mode of operation 2 2 1 pseudo steady state biofiltration column operations with vuv as post treatment all columns were operated in a daily fed batch mode with an ebct of 24 h secondary effluent from a local wwtp was fed for twenty two consecutive weeks to allow biofilm to develop biofilm developed around the filter media as well as in the media pores until a pseudo steady state condition was achieved pseudo steady state was established when stability in integral mass balances reached 5 change in conventional parameters once pseudo steady state was achieved performance of biofiltration columns was assessed using an intense sampling event hereafter referred to as intermediate sampling event ise where the above parameters were sampled daily for seven consecutive days and integral mass balances on gross parameters were conducted additionally two composite samples were generated by combining daily aliquots of biofiltered wastewater for further treatment composite samples were subjected to post treatment at two vuv energy levels referred as vuv e1 or 1 kwh m3 and vuv e10 or 10 kwh m3 2 2 2 pseudo steady state biofiltration column operations with vuv as pre treatment starting from the twenty third week of operation the feed procedure was modified so that the first column columns c1 and z1 in fig 1 served as control and continued to be fed with the untreated secondary effluent while the second columns c2 and z2 in fig 1 and the third columns c3 and z3 in fig 1 were fed with different vuv energy vuv e1 or 1 kwh m3 and vuv e10 or 10 kwh m3 respectively the goal of this phase of work was to investigate the impact of vuv pre treatment on biofiltration biofiltration columns were operated without interruption for an additional five weeks at the end of which a final sampling event fse was conducted to evaluate pseudo steady state conditions the composite included sample collection for wastewater feed and treated wastewater for 7 8 days 2 2 3 biofiltration kinetic experiments kinetic experiments were conducted using biofiltration columns at different ebcts the shortest ebct was 1 5 min 0 025 h the time needed for columns to drain by gravity with the drain valve fully open hereafter referred as quick drainage the additional ebcts investigated were obtained by halving the longests ebct 24 h resulting in a series of 0 375 0 750 1 500 3 000 6 000 12 000 and 24 000 h 2 3 breakthrough adsorption tests on biofiltering media the adsorptive capacity of virgin gac and zeolite for conventional contaminants i e soluble cod and nitrate and cecs was determined by assessing breakthrough in two miniature columns each with a working volume of 65 ml and a diameter of 2 cm containing 36 7 g gac and 52 0 g zeolite due to the similar particle size distribution columns were operated at a continuous flow of 1 4 ml min corresponding to a residence time of 45 min about 83 bed volumes bvs and 31 bvs of secondary effluent were treated in the gac and zeolite respectively approximately 150 ml of sample was collected for every 500 ml of treated influent 75 ml before and 75 ml after the target volume the relationship between bvs and treatment time is provided in fig si 2

sampled from the top and bottom portions of the filter beds second after manually shaking of the biomass associated with media the liquid phase was collected by passing the mixture of fluid and grains through a sieve thus generating a dispersed sample which was paired to the granular sample biomass from the granular sample was obtained following an extraction procedure involving sonication as described in text si 3 samples were stored at 4 c and shipped to the microbial ecology lab institut de recherche et de développement en agroenvironnement irda for analysis in addition aliquots of raw

for asv richness and evenness β diversity was assessed based on the taxonomic characterization at phylum level which was determined by computing the relative abundance of each microbe detected in each

summarized in table 1 data reflect all samples collected during the twenty seven week experimental period overall data confirm good quality of secondary effluent consistent with a well functioning conventional activated sludge plants achieving full nitrification total cod averaged 26 mg l nitrates accounted for more than 99 of total nitrogen with low ammonia and nitrite concentrations toc ranged from 5 17 5 67 mg l with respect to cecs targeted screening by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms allowed identification and quantification of twenty nine cecs table 2 concentrations of cecs ranged from 0 02 to 2 1 µg l with total cecs computed as the sum of individual cecs total cecs was used as a surrogate parameter to assess performance of the system total cecs in secondary effluent was 9 27 0 45 µg l with 8 of the 12 indicator substances in the swiss regulations foen 2022 detected table 2 cecs relevant to swiss regulation were benzotriazole carbamazepine citalopram clarithromycin diclofenac irbesartan metoprolol and venlafaxine the sum of cecs concentrations total cecsw averaged 2 94 0 29 µg l 3 1 2 gac system performance of the gac control column was assessed for the removal of conventional contaminants by computing integrated mass balances over multiple sampling days 7 and 8 respectively for intermediate and final sampling events the slopes obtained from the cumulative masses computed at the inlet and outlet of the biofiltration column c1 as a function of the sampling period were utilized to estimate efficiency of s cod and nitrate removal fig 2 s cod removal efficiency 90 were obtained and did not change during the 27 week experimental period conversely nitrate removal efficiency progressively decreased over time from 58 at intermediate sampling bvs 50 to 38 at the second sampling event bvs 60 ammonia which was already low in the influent was completely removed by biofiltration while total and soluble phosphorus removals were 60 and not appreciably different between the ise and fse fig si 5 toc was degraded with efficiencies 99 as shown by experimental data after both intermediate and final sampling events with effluent concentrations of 4 µg l well below the most stringent limit for potable reuse in california 0 5 mg l u s environmental protection agency 2018 breakthrough in the miniature column tests for virgin carbon indicated that s cod and nitrate were initially adsorbed onto gac and reached more than 90 saturation 60 bvs indicating exhaustion of capacity at 80 bvs fig si 3 by plotting breakthrough curves for virgin material with the biofiltration column performance using bvs as x axis fig 3 it can be concluded that nitrate reduction was driven by adsorption fig 3 a while reduction of s cod was driven by biological reactions fig 3 b this is consistent with observations of peterson and summers 2021 and confirms that gac had transitioned to biological activated carbon bac to elucidate the removal mechanisms in the biofiltration columns kinetic tests were conducted at different contact times these experiments were conducted on columns operated at ebct 24 h kinetic tests reflect the behavior of biofiltration at steady state for a fixed ebct of 24 h as shown in fig 4 s cod concentration normalized over the concentration of raw secondary effluent was linear as a function of contact time when log transformed suggesting that a power law could suitably fit experimental observations r2 0 65 the log log behaviour of observed data can be explained by considering the co occurrence of first order degradation kinetics linearizing with a y axis in log scale with diffusion limited absorption dominated removal mechanisms linearizing with x axis in log scale the quick drainage experiment removed 35 of s cod with an additional 43 removal occurring within the following 22 5 min no further improvement was observed after 45 min while 90 removal was achieved in 180 min with the remaining 10 being removed after 720 min considering that 43 bvs were treated in the column at the time of the kinetic test and the residual gac absorption capacity was 20 s cod as determined by the minicolumn test the removal during quick drainage experiment was adsorption particularly given the short ebct however the biological contributions were relevant at ebcts 45 min in agreement with peterson and summers 2021 who found that ebcts 45 60 min are needed by bac biofilters to efficiently remove effluent organic matter similar behavior was also observed in the second kinetic test at 60 bvs when removal by quick drainage was halved with respect to the previous test while the incremental s cod abatement within 22 5 min accounted for 47 at 45 min ebct removal efficiency was 72 with an effluent s cod concentration below the value estimated by the breakthrough test at the same ebct additionally after 22 5 min ebct the removal efficiency increased by 6 8 by doubling ebct up to 360 min and then by quadrupling ebct to 24 h indicating that biological activity was boosting s cod removal at ebcts 45 min with respect to cecs breakthrough tests showed that adsorption of cecs did not correlate with adsorption of s cod fig si 3 at 80 bvs the residual cecs adsorptive capacity was 80 while media was saturated with s cod suggesting that cecs adsorption may occur longer than s cod adsorption this is confirmed by the kinetic tests fig 4 as the total cecs removal rate r2 0 99 was higher than that for s cod removal with 70 of total cecs being removed during quick drainage experiments and 98 removal being reached within 22 5 min ebct fig 4 the high residual adsorption capacity of gac for cecs and the very short times involved for removal infers that biodegradation assessed at short ebcts in this study was not a significant contributor to removal of cecs as expected no cecs were detected in bac column effluent during the fse cecs removal was not assessed after the ise this result demonstrates that biological removal of bulk organic matter was prolonging gac life allowing it to harness residual adsorption capacity for cecs removal ultimately gac columns were operating as bac filters and effluents were compliant with the most stringent regulations for toc in potable reuse as established by california only nitrate which should not exceed the drinking water national maximum contaminant level mcl of 10 mg l national primary water regulation https www epa gov ground water and drinking water national primary drinking water regulations was of concern in addition ebcts between 45 min and 90 min were needed to achieve 80 removal of s cod and 98 cecs abatement 1 7 log removal which together may be considered for addressing potable water quality standards 3 1 3 zeolite system all the procedures used to assess gac columns were conducted in parallel for gz columns under identical operating conditions breakthrough tests for virgin zeolite revealed no adsorption capacity for s cod nitrate and nitrite with a weak adsorption observed for s p fig si 4 in the case of total cecs breakthrough occurred quickly reaching saturation at about 20 bvs fig si 4 consequently at the time of both sampling events and kinetic tests the adsorption capacity for conventional pollutants and cecs was already exhausted except for ammonia which was removed mostly due to ion exchange as expected from breakthrough tests the gz system did not remove nitrates however integrated mass balances revealed that control column z1 preserved its performance in abating s cod between the two sampling events about 40 removal was measured at the end of both ise and fse fig si 6 and considering the inability of zeolite to adsorb s cod biological mechanisms were assumed to be responsible for bulk organic matter removal phosphorus removal was negligible at the end of ise while 37 of t p and 20 of s p were abated at the end of experiments interestingly the gz control column removed 65 and 43 of toc after ise and fse respectively although higher than allowed by california regulations for potable reuse 0 5 mg l toc concentrations in the effluent from the gz control column was 2 93 mg l which is compliant with guidance for potable reuse in most other us states for example in florida toc must be 3 mg l u s environmental protection agency 2018 when the s cod removal of the zeolite biofiltration column control with no vuv pre treatment was assessed over time fig 5 the removal was less pronounced than observed in the bac column at 43 bvs s cod removal reached 45 after 24 h fig 5 the same kinetic test repeated at 60 bvs indicated a drop in s cod removal efficiency with only 37 biodegraded at 24 h ebct kinetic tests showed that total cecs removal followed s cod removal trends fig 5 cecs abatement reached 46 after 24 h ebct when considered individually 7 cecs were not detected in the effluent of column z1 after fse i e atv ctp cla fba lvfx los and mpa indicating these compounds were more biodegradable or better retained by ion exchange interestingly of the 12 substances in the swiss regulation only ctp and cla were detected in the effluent and removed by 21 substantial removal was observed for eedp and stg 82 and 92 respectively a group of cecs including dcf stl atl and tlm were removed from 50 70 while ctz mtp mtf irb vlx removal ranged from 25 50 all other compounds were not removed by zeolite biofiltration overall although clearly inferior to bac zeolite demonstrated a measurable removal of cecs ebcts for zeolite biofiltration between 45 90 min only achieved s cod and total cecs removals 10 which is too low for potable reuse necessitating longer ebcts to reach 40 removal 6 to 12 h 3 2 evaluation of the effects of vuv as pre and post treatment 3 2 1 impact of vuv treatment on conventional pollutants the treatment of secondary effluent using vuv showed as expected different performance depending on energy applied cod as well as toc doc and nitrates exhibited weak removal with a linear decrease with increasing vuv treatment energy fig 6 a c at vuv e1 1 kwh m3 average removal efficiencies were 11 for s cod 8 for toc and doc and 4 for nitrate at vuv e10 10 kwh m3 s cod was reduced on average by 20 toc and doc by 15 and nitrate by only 10 no effect was observed on phosphorus conversely formation of nitrite via reaction of nitrate with solvated electrons and hydrogen ions produced by water photolysis was not negligible with concentrations after treatment at vuv e1 and vuv e10 of 50 times initial concentrations fig 6 d similar effects on conventional contaminants were observed when applying vuv as post treatment to gac and gz effluents it is also interesting to note that when nitrite formation was normalized by initial nitrate concentrations both influent and effluent kinetic profiles overlapped confirming a stochiometric conversion between precursor nitrate and photoproduct nitrite as a function of the vuv energy applied fig si 7 this highlights the importance of the formation of photoproducts with vuv as the final treatment process to avoid exceedance of nitrite limits in the treated water for example california and florida rules stipulate a limit of 1 mg l as nitrite nitrogen u s environmental protection agency 2018 a limit met under post treatment by vuv e1 or 1 kw m3 from both bac effluent nitrite of 0 2 mg l and gz effluent nitrite of 0 4 mg l but exceeded at high vuv energies vuv e10 or 10 kw m3 3 2 2 impact of vuv treatment on biofiltration system performance the impact of vuv pre treatment on performance of both gac and gz biofilters was assessed based on integrated mass balances computed over the 8 days of the fse 27th week table 3 summarizes tertiary biofilter performance with and without vuv pre treatment with respect to conventional contaminants performance of gac filters c2 and c3 for cod removal total and soluble was similar to control column c1 with an efficiency 90 i e no significant impact of vuv pre treatment was observed effluent toc concentrations were below the california limit for potable reuse 0 5 mg l and ammonia was absent in all biofilter effluents interestingly nitrite removal efficiencies of 95 and 99 respectively were measured in columns c2 and c3 higher than the control column c1 63 this demonstrated the increase in nitrite due to vuv pre treatment did not adversely affect removal efficiency total and soluble p removal efficiencies were 65 and 55 respectively with no impact of vuv pre treatment in the zeolite system cod removal increased linearly from column z1 to z3 with the s cod reduction ranging from 40 in z1 to 55 in z2 and 60 in z3 toc and doc removals in columns z2 and z3 were consistent with cod reductions and although effluent toc concentrations exceeded the stringent california limit for potable reuse 0 5 mgtoc l they met criteria used in other us states for groundwater recharge e g florida u s environmental protection agency 2018 this suggests that vuv pre treatment impact on water matrix biodegradability increased with increasing treatment energy kinetic tests at different contact times revealed that in columns z2 only 17 removal was achieved in 90 min ebct although double compared to the 8 at the same contact time in column z1 in addition 45 removal was observed within 720 min 8 higher than in column z1 at the same ebct in the case of column z3 efficiencies of 25 and 50 were achieved at ebcts of 90 and 180 min confirming that pre treatment at a high energy contributed to reducing the ebct to reach at 50 removal of bulk organic matter in zeolite biofilters as expected ammonia was absent in all gz effluents due to ion exchange adam et al 2019 karri et al 2018 while nitrate was not removed phosphorus removal was lower in comparison with gac columns at about 37 and 20 for total and soluble p respectively these findings demonstrated that the choice of appropriate carrier media i e gac or gz is crucial to optimally integrate biofiltration with vuv for potential potable reuse schemes 3 2 3 impact of vuv treatment on cecs the effects of treatment energy on cecs abatement during pre treatment of the secondary effluent were evident at low treatment energy vuv e1 7 compounds atv cbze dcf fba los mpa and stl were completely transformed while increasing treatment energy by an order of magnitude eliminated an additional 12 compounds cbz cbdz ctz ctp cla lvfx lid mtp mtpa olm tmd and vlx table si 4 among the 10 remaining compounds measured atl bta eddp fcn irb ltg stg tlm were removed with efficiencies ranging from 81 to 98 while the most recalcitrant mtf and fcz were removed by 54 and 57 respectively by analogy considering the criteria adopted by swiss regulation for secondary effluents low treatment energy eliminated dcf while the other 11 compounds on the swiss shortlist of indicators were abated with efficiencies well above 80 both individually and on average at high treatment energy overall vuv pre treatment at low treatment energy reduced initial total cecs load by 41 0 23 log removal while the highest treatment energy resulted in 90 removal 1 log removal as expected pre treatment of the feed impacted performance of gac and gz biofilters differently no cecs were detected in the effluent of the gac control column due to fast adsorption the same behavior was observed in c2 and c3 columns accentuated by the fact that the initial total cecs load was reduced the fact that vuv transforms a significant aliquot of cecs from secondary effluent especially at high energy level may suggest that pre treatment could prolong the life of activated carbon by enhancing cecs removal this was confirmed by kinetic tests at different ebcts fig 7 which revealed residual concentrations decreased with increasing pre treatment energy additionally the incremental total cecs concentration removed corresponded to the distance between the breakthrough concentration without pre treatment yellow circle in fig 7 and the concentration achieved with pre treatment which increased with the vuv energy regardless of the vuv pre treatment 98 of the total cecs removal occurred in each column within 22 5 min ebct at almost the same rate demonstrating the main mechanism of cecs removal was adsorption it is worth noting that pre treatment at vuv e10 increased the removal of total cecs in column c3 from 1 to 2 log removal at the same ebct with respect to column c1 due to the complete removal of cecs by gac filters post treatment did not lead to further performance improvements while more research is needed to conclusively develop optimal treatment trains involving vuv and gac it is possible to conclude that treatment consisting of vuv as a pre treatment at energy density of e1 or 1 kw m3 followed by gac facilitates excellent removal of cecs and toc exceeding the quality stipulated by the most stringent regulations for potable reuse in the case of the gz system pre treatment at different energy levels resulted in shifts of total cecs decay rates when column z2 and z3 were tested at different ebcts fig si 8 in comparison with the control column z1 however the removal efficiency increased after 45 min in contrast to removal of s cod indicating that pre treatment markedly reduced the ebct needed to degrade cecs probably due to the partial oxidation and photolysis of cecs mixture performance of the gz columns with vuv post treatment in relationship to total cecs clearly identifies treatment schemes capable of achieving 80 removal of the initial total cecs fig 8 pre treatment at the highest treatment energy met the threshold of 80 removal efficiency of cecs while succeeding biofiltration did not contribute to additional cecs removal post treatment improved abatement to 1 8 log removal at vuv e10 and 80 removal was also achieved by pre treatment at vuv e1 followed by biofiltration with post treatment at vuv e1 vuv e1 bfgz vuv e1 further post treatment at vuv e10 increased cecs removal by more than 1 2 log another treatment train capable of achieving 80 removal as requested by the swiss regulation of total cecs was biofiltration with no pre treatment of the feed followed by post treatment at vuv e10 bfgz vuv e10 this has been also observed for total cecsw and it is worth noting that biofilter z1 alone reduced total cecs by 40 while biofilter z2 achieved an additional 30 over vuv i e with vuv pretreatment at the low energy level and biofiltration for a 70 reduction in total cecs among these combinations fig 8 the treatment train with vuv as a pre treatment at energy density of e1 or 1 kw m3 followed by zeolite biofiltration at ebct of 24 h and post treated with vuv at energy density of e1 or 1 kw m3 denoted as vuv e1 bfgz vuv e1 was the most promising zld option when zeolite were used as biofiltration media indeed although higher doses 10 kwh m3 could further enhance the cecs removal performance the higher electrical cost and the potential formation of nitrite and other photoproducts could be an issue finally it is interesting to analyze the differential removals for cecs when aggregated by molecular weights mws three classes were defined for this purpose with 9 compounds in class mw1 100 mw 267 including atl bta cbdz cbz cbze lid ltg mtf mtp 10 compounds in class mw2 267 mw 350 including ctp dcf eddp fba fcz mpa mtpa stl tmd vlx and the other 10 in class mw3 350 mw 750 including atv cla ctz fcn irb los lvfx olm stg tlm fig 9 clearly shows the impact of each treatment on the removal by mw class specifically treatment performance increases with mw indicating that large mw compounds are easier to transform than smaller compounds this may justify the use of higher vuv energy to ensure removal efficiencies greater than 80 irrespective of mw with respect to biofiltration column z1 without pre treatment did not remove compounds in class mw1 darkest shade of red color in fig 9 while the efficiency reached 57 for compounds in class mw2 increasing until 77 for compounds in class mw3 this indicated that higher mw are better removed in zeolite media similar trends were observed in columns z2 and z3 although with higher removals due to vuv pre treatment demonstrating that vuv pre treatment had a role in removal of high mw complete removal of compounds in class mw2 and mw3 were observed at vuv e10 details on the removal of individual cecs by the zeolite system are provided in text si 4 3 3 characterization of microbial compositional diversity in biofilters high quality of dna extraction was confirmed by the a260 a280 absorbance ratio of 1 8 glasel 1995 biomass quantification revealed that total prokaryotes were 2 fold more abundant in bac columns than in zeolite columns t test at 95 confidence level p 0 0033 suggesting that activated carbon favored biomass development in addition the amount of prokaryotes in dispersed samples was about 2 2 65 times higher than in granular samples in gac and in gz samples respectively this indicates a loosely attached biofilm tending to easily detach manual shaking in the gac system the average total prokaryote concentrations in the granular and dispersed samples were 5 0 107 1 2 107 au g and 1 0 108 4 8 107 au ml respectively compared to 2 0 107 7 8 106 au g and 5 3 107 1 4 107 au ml in the gz system total prokaryotes in column influents were 3 1 106 9 9 104 au ml 4 3 106 9 1 105 au ml and 3 3 106 3 1 105 au ml in secondary effluent and pre treated aliquots at vuv e1 and vuv e10 respectively total prokaryotes appeared to remain almost unchanged after vuv treatment this can be explained by the inability of the dna method to distinguish between live and dead organisms i e upon die off the release of cellular contents microorganisms can occur overall biomass concentrations in dispersed samples based on au ml was one order of magnitude higher than in the corresponding feed with respect to α diversity the good agreement between asv with chao1 index indicated the goodness of prediction of less abundant species based on shannon index analyses it was also observed that richness within columns was marginally influenced by media type although it was more pronounced in zeolite columns and that vuv pre treatment did not impact microbial diversity no clear relationship with column depth was observed a detailed discussion on shannon index analysis is provided in text si 5 all prokaryotes identified belonged to bacteria and archaea kingdoms with bacteria predominating 90 characteristics of the most abundant communities are presented in table si 5 while the taxonomic composition of secondary effluent before and after vuv pre treatment and of gac and gz biofilters is summarized in fig si 9 proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum 56 in untreated secondary effluent followed by bacteroidetes 31 and actinobacteria 4 which together accounted for 91 of the total microbes the remaining 9 of microorganisms included verrucomicrobia 2 parcubacteria 1 6 firmicutes 1 1 and a great variety of phyla with relative abundance lower than 1 including planctomycetes gemmatimonadetes chlorobi uncultured bacteria acidobacteria and nitrospirae only 0 1 this composition is consistent with published wastewater microbial characterization fang et al 2018 gerrity et al 2018 guarin and pagilla 2021 osunmakinde et al 2019 wu et al 2019 in agreement with the α diversity metric vuv pre treatment of secondary effluent at low energy vuv e1 dramatically decreased community diversity in a way that proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria together accounted for 98 of the entire microbial distribution the higher treatment energy vuv e10 achieved a drastic reduction of bacteroidetes while proteobacteria was more resistant to treatment becoming almost the unique consortium 99 in highly pre treated feed these findings highlight how vuv pre treatment selectively inactivates taxa based on their sensitivities to vuv uv light impacting microbial ecology in absolute and relative abundance with respect to the biofiltration system it was observed that proteobacteria remained the most abundant phylum in both gac and gz biofilters accounting for more than 50 on average except for granular zeolite which showed about 40 to elucidate the compositional diversity of bac and zeolite biofilters β diversity was assessed by computing the chi square distance chi 2 as proximity measures text si 6 usually chi 2 is computed utilizing relative abundance data and captures differences in the relative composition of samples often called the shape of samples rather than size of samples greenacre 2017 because the size of bac samples was higher than zeolite samples because biomass concentrations were two times higher in bac than in zeolite biofilters chi 2 was chosen to assess compositional dissimilarities principal coordinates analysis pcoa was conducted to map chi 2 metrics and results are presented in fig 10 where dissimilarities distances between dots were observed between bac and zeolite samples indicating material type had an impact on the microbial structure in biofilters some species like gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria and thaumarchaeota thrived more in zeolite biofilters average abundance of 3 3 5 1 and 6 9 respectively than in bac average abundance of 1 2 1 5 and 0 01 respectively while ta06 bacteria were found only in bac samples albeit at low concentration average relative abundance of 0 5 additionally differences between dispersed and granular samples which were more pronounced in the bac samples confirmed that some species tended to detach while others exhibited a more attached lifestyle for example the relative abundance of bacteroidetes was 4 6 and 4 0 on average in attached bac and zeolite samples respectively compared to 9 4 and 8 0 doubled in dispersed samples demonstrating a tendency to detach from both materials on the contrary planctomycetes showed relative abundance of 9 5 and 11 0 in attached bac and zeolite samples respectively which decreased to 6 4 and 7 1 in dispersed bac and zeolite samples exhibiting a more pronounced attached lifestyle similarly gemmatimonadetes acidobacteria and thaumarchaeota were more abundant in attached samples than in dispersed samples suggesting that they thrive as attached biomass in the bac system the scarcity of ta06 in dispersed samples could suggest these microbes exist as attached biomass the presence of the anaerobic heterotroph woesearchaeota which probably gained richness in a symbiotic metabolism with ta06 implies co operation with other microbes similarly to the superphylum asgardarchaeota huang et al 2019 macleod et al 2019 compositional structure was not clearly affected by the depth of sampling fig 10 as observed with α diversity vuv energy markedly influenced β diversity in the influent to columns although this did not have a clear impact on the compositional structure of biofilters considering that pre treatment of the feed lasted only 5 weeks the possibility that bac and zeolite systems change their internal β diversity within a longer timeframe cannot be excluded overall it can be concluded that differences in microbial structure between bac and zeolite biofilters emerged with β diversity metrics and this was confirmed by taxonomic classifications thaumarchaeota was the most abundant new phylum in zeolite biofilters thaumarchaeota together with gemmatimonadetes and acidobacteria thrived in the attached biofilm on the zeolite media due to the broad heterogeneity in richness and composition at genus level and considering the different mechanisms in organic matter and cecs degradation it is difficult to correlate the presence and abundance of specific taxa to the abatement of cecs however the prevalence of thaumarchaeota acidobacteria and gemmatimonadetes in the zeolite columns relative to bac could suggest these taxa might have had a role in degrading cecs biologically 4 summary and conclusions the integration of a vuv based aop with gac zeolite biofilters as pre and post treatment was studied in a laboratory scale system the impact of vuv energy dose and biofiltration media on microbial ecology was also assessed based on the findings of this study the following conclusions can be made at the end of the experimental period 60 bvs when gac transitioned to bac based on s cod removal adsorption was the main mechanism for cecs and nitrate removal in all combinations tested in this study gac based biofiltration outperformed zeolite based biofiltration more specifically pre treatment at energy density vuv e1 electrical energy applied of 1 kw m3 followed by gac proved excellent removal of cecs and toc exceeding the most stringent regulations for potable reuse among the tested combinations involving zeolite biofiltration vuv e1 electrical energy applied of 1 kw m3 employed as a pre treatment of the secondary effluent and post treatment of zeolite biofiltered effluent allowed to remove 80 of total cecs and to reduce toc to values below florida limit for potable reuse of 3 mg l this indicates the possibility of employing granular media not requiring regeneration in biofiltration applications for potable reuse vuv alone as pre treatment markedly degraded cecs achieving 40 cecs removal at vuv e1 electrical energy applied of 1 kw m3 and 90 at vuv e10 electrical energy applied of 10 kw m3 vuv treatment favored the transformation of large molecular weight into low molecular weight compounds both showing different biodegradation and absorption properties when subjected to biofiltration when applied as post treatment to zeolite effluents vuv e1 electrical energy applied of 1 kw m3 and vuv e10 electrical energy applied of 10 kw m3 further increased cecs removal by 20 and 90 respectively in the zeolite system vuv pre treatment also increased s cod removal efficiency indicating that higher treatment energy increased biodegradability total prokaryotes were 2 fold more abundant in granular carbon than zeolite columns with vuv treatment markedly affecting microbial diversity both in terms of richness and composition carrier media type only marginally affected microbial richness in the

15824,integrating anammox with denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo in the membrane biofilm reactor mbfr is a promising technology capable of achieving complete nitrogen removal from wastewater however it remains unknown whether reactor configurations featuring longitudinal gradients parallel to the membrane surface would affect the performance of the ch4 driven mbfr to this end this work aims to study the impacts of longitudinal heterogeneity potentially present in the gas and liquid phases on a representative ch4 driven mbfr performing anammox damo by applying the reported modified compartmental modeling approach through comparing the modeling results of different reactor configurations this work not only offered important guidance for better design operation and monitoring of the ch4 driven mbfr but also revealed important implications for prospective related modeling research the total nitrogen removal efficiency of the mbfr at non excessive ch4 supply e g surface loading of 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 in this work was found to be insensitive to both longitudinal gradients in the liquid and gas phases comparatively the longitudinal gradient in the liquid phase led to distinct longitudinal biomass stratification and therefore played an influential role in the effective ch4 utilization efficiency which was also related to the extent of reactor compartmentation considered in modeling when supplied with non excessive ch4 the mbfr is recommended to be designed operated with both the biofilm reactor and the membrane lumen as plug flow reactors pfrs with co current flow of wastewater and ch4 which could mitigate dissolved ch4 discharge in the effluent for the reactor configurations with the biofilm reactor designed operated as a pfr multi spot sampling in the longitudinal direction is needed to obtain a correct representation of the microbial composition of the mbfr graphicalabstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo longitudinal gradient membrane biofilm reactor mbfr modeling 1 introduction although the combination of partial nitritation pn and anammox has been recognized as a sustainable technology for removing nitrogen from wastewater its theoretical maximum removal efficiency is limited to 89 due to the indispensable no3 production from the anammox process strous et al 1998 the discovery of denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo processes ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 where damo archaea and damo bacteria the two guilds of functional microorganisms can achieve denitratation no3 no2 and denitritation no2 n2 respectively with electrons deriving from anaerobic oxidation of methane ch4 provides a promising alternative coupling pn anammox with damo enables complete nitrogen removal through making use of the ch4 directly produced on site of wastewater treatment plants wwtps implementing anaerobic digestion for excess sludge treatment and energy recovery considering the distinct microbial preferences for oxygen and the ease of operation it is particularly suitable to enforce such an integrated nitrogen removal technology in a two stage system consisting of a first stage pn reactor with the supply of air and a second stage ch4 driven anoxic reactor performing anammox damo due to the low solubility of ch4 e g 22 mg ch4 l at 1 atm and 20 c peng et al 2020 and the slow growth of both anammox bacteria and damo microorganisms jetten et al 1997 kampman et al 2012 the membrane biofilm reactor mbfr is an ideal reactor configuration to couple anammox with damo and retain sufficient mixed biomass in such a mbfr ch4 is provided from inside gas permeable membranes and subjected to cross phase mass transfer while the effluent of the first stage pn reactor mainly containing nh4 and no2 is supplied from the bulk liquid the separate provision of gas phase and liquid phase substrates results in the formation of controlled redox stratification of the biofilm harbouring anammox bacteria and damo microorganisms on the membrane surface as well as the efficient utilization of substrates within the biofilm nevertheless only limited efforts have been dedicated to the experimental demonstration of the mbfr coupling anammox with damo cai et al 2018 liu et al 2020b shi et al 2013 xie et al 2017 xie et al 2018 despite its evident technological advantages this is mainly due to the forefront uncertainties and difficulties associated with the design operation and monitoring of the mbfr in addition to the lack of knowledge on competitive and synergic interactions between the functional microorganisms involved in this sense mathematical modeling could serve as a powerful tool to comprehensively understand and evaluate the mbfr coupling anammox with damo however the reported modeling works in this regard chen et al 2014 chen et al 2016 liu et al 2020a peng et al 2020 were mainly in the traditional one dimensional 1d domain which only captured axial gradients within the biofilm i e perpendicular to the membrane surface and couldn t account for the potential occurrence of longitudinal gradients in the liquid phase or and the gas phase parallel to the membrane surface analogous longitudinal heterogeneity which has been documented in the literature for the oxygen driven mbfr martin and nerenberg 2012 perez calleja et al 2017 syron and casey 2008 has been proved to play a pivotal role from the modeling perspective acevedo alonso and lackner 2019 chen et al 2020 however the relevant conclusions obtained for the oxygen driven mbfr wouldn t apply to the ch4 driven mbfr due to the fundamental difference between the treatment mechanisms behind these two mbfr technologies i e pn anammox vs anammox damo therefore it is worthwhile to adopt a reliable modeling approach to verify the potential role of longitudinal heterogeneity in the ch4 driven mbfr to this end through applying the modified compartmental modeling approach reported by chen et al 2020 this work aims to systematically investigate the impacts of longitudinal gradients on the nitrogen removal performance effective ch4 utilization and microbial composition of the mbfr performing anammox damo this work would expectedly provide useful and practical guidance for better design operation and monitoring of the ch4 driven mbfr to achieve complete nitrogen removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 model framework the reported bioprocess model that describes the anammox and damo processes and has been reliably tested and verified against both long term and batch experimental data at 22 2 c and ph of 7 0 chen et al 2014 chen et al 2016 was directly adopted in this work since heterotrophic bacteria might also grow on the biomass decay products even in the absence of external organics supply the heterotrophic denitrification processes of activated sludge model no 1 at 20 c and neutral ph

parameters involved are listed in supplementary table s3 si 2 2 mbfr configurations a mbfr can essentially be seen as a biofilm reactor connected to a membrane lumen through gas permeable membranes depending on the specific reactor configurations and operational conditions there might be longitudinal gradients in the liquid phase or and the gas phase of the mbfr therefore both the membrane lumen and the biofilm reactor could be plug flow reactors pfrs the modified compartmental model reported by chen et al 2020 was thus adopted to enable the handy simulation of longitudinal heterogeneity in the commonly used modeling platform aquasim reichert 1998 as shown in table 1 in addition to the traditional modeling approach where both the membrane lumen and the biofilm reactor were modeled as continuously stirred tank reactors cstrs 4 types of mfbr configurations were designed to evaluate different combinations of longitudinal gradients in the gas and liquid phases of the mbfr as delineated in fig 1 a when the biofilm reactor needed to be simulated as a cstr the compartmental model first equally divided the biofilm reactor into a defined number m m n 1 of compartments including n biofilm reactor compartments and 1 mixed reactor compartment and then used diffusive links with a sufficiently high mass transfer rate to connect each biofilm reactor compartment to the mixed reactor compartment comparatively to simulate the biofilm reactor as a pfr all the biofilm reactor compartments were sequentially connected using advective links i e fig 1 b d diffusive links were used to simulate the ch4 supply from each of the advectively linked compartments of the membrane lumen as a pfr i e fig 1 a c and d to the corresponding compartment of the biofilm reactor by contrast the membrane lumen as a cstr was directly modeled using one single mixed reactor compartment i e fig 1 b which was connected to all the biofilm reactor compartments simultaneously by diffusive links it needs to be highlighted that both co current flow and counter current flow of ch4 and wastewater to the mbfr were explored in this work i e fig 1 c vs fig 1 d consistent with acevedo alonso and lackner 2019 and chen et al 2020 the direct longitudinal interaction between biofilms in different compartments wasn t considered in the modified compartmental model applied in this work as shown in table 1 to understand the influence of the extent of reactor compartmentation each type of mbfr configuration in consideration of longitudinal heterogeneity was tested in both 3 and 5 reactor compartments to ensure comparability all the different mbfr configurations were designed to be consistent in i the overall volume of the membrane lumen biofilm reactor and ii the overall mass transfer rate from the membrane lumen to the biofilm reactor 2 3 simulation conditions all the 5 types of mbfr configurations shown in table 1 were simulated with the reactor setup and optimal operational conditions previously reported for the ch4 driven mbfr performing anammox damo to achieve complete nitrogen removal from the side stream wastewater with a total nitrogen tn i e no2 n nh4 n concentration of 500 g n m 3 at the optimum influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 1 chen et al 2016 i total reactor volume of 1 m3 consisting of 0 96 m3 biofilm reactor and 0 04 m3 membrane lumen ii total biofilm area of 235 m2 iii ch4 loading of 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 determined by dividing the product of the supplied ch4 concentration and flowrate by the total biofilm area iv influent flow rate of 0 32

biofilm thickness distribution and vi overall mass transfer coefficient for ch4 of 0 278 m d 1 as tested by chen et al 2016 deviated operational conditions could compromise the treatment performance to further explore the role of longitudinal heterogeneity in the simulated ch4 driven mbfr suboptimal operational conditions were also tested by i adjusting the influent no2 n nh4 n ratio to 3 2 and 2 3 and ii varying the ch4 surface loading from 0 016 to 0 256 g cod m 2 d 1 through regulating the ch4 flowrate representing the reported conditions from limited to excessive ch4 supply by chen et al 2016 the detailed parameter settings used for model simulations are presented in supplementary table s4 si for each simulation scenario the initial concentrations of all the soluble components were assumed to be zero in the biofilm and the bulk liquid while each of the 4 functional microorganisms xan xda xdb and xhb and the abiotic organics xs xi was assumed to account for 20 of the initial particulate cod in the biofilm matrix all simulations were run to reach the steady state indicated by constant effluent concentrations biofilm thickness and microbial composition based on the steady state influent and effluent concentrations the tn removal efficiency was calculated using eq 1 given the formation of dissolved ch4 in the bulk liquid the ch4 utilization efficiency was calculated using eq 2 while a high tn removal efficiency should be pursued a low ch4 utilization efficiency corresponding to the discharge of a high fraction of ch4 supplied in the effluent should be avoided a high ch4 utilization efficiency was desired to reduce ch4 loss in the effluent rather than in the gas stream exiting the membrane lumen this was built on the following assumptions i the ch4 flux leaving the membrane lumen wasn t seen as a problem since it could be effectively recycled back into the membrane lumen to constitute the feed and ii gas back diffusion wasn t significant since the mbfr studied was operated in the open end mode perez calleja et al 2017 1 tn removal efficiency 1 s nh 4 out s no 2 out s no 3 out s nh 4 in s no 2 in 100 where snh4 in and sno2 in are the influent

table 1 are illustrated in fig 2 including the steady state tn removal efficiency ch4 utilization efficiency and overall biomass composition under the optimal operational conditions studied in this work the traditional modeling configuration of the ch4 driven mbfr with both the biofilm reactor and the membrane lumen as cstrs i e configuration 1 in fig 2 led to a tn removal efficiency of 98 9 which was slightly higher than the value i e 93 2 reported for a lab scale mbfr performing anammox damo without specific control over ch4 supply xie et al 2017 the accompanying ch4 utilization efficiency was 79 7 which was much lower than the value i e 96 0 documented by cai et al 2018 that tested the impact of ch4 supply on another lab scale mbfr performing anammox damo the noted discrepancy was ascribed to their provision of no3 n nh4 n as substrates at a ratio of 2 rather than no2 n nh4 n at a ratio of 1 in this work the oversupply of no3 n significantly strengthened the ch4 consumption by damo microorganisms especially damo archaea in the biofilm leading to elevated ch4 utilization overall anammox bacteria 74 and damo archaea 15 were the dominant species while damo bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria were not found in the biofilm the results for configuration 1 served as the benchmark for the following comparisons with other mbfr configurations in consideration of longitudinal heterogeneity 3 1 1 mbfr configurations with one single longitudinal gradient configurations 2 1 2 2 in fig 2 considered the longitudinal gradient in ch4 while the biofilm reactor remained a cstr however their tn removal ch4 utilization and overall biomass composition all remained nearly unchanged as compared to those of configuration 1 this observation indicated that under the optimal operational conditions studied in this work the longitudinal gradient in ch4 alone would not significantly affect the overall performance of the ch4 driven mbfr even though similar tn removal around 99 0 was observed for the simulated mbfr configurations with the membrane lumen as a cstr and the biofilm reactor as a pfr i e configurations 3 1 3 2 in fig 2 higher ch4 utilization over 85 0 was obtained as compared to configuration 1 due to both the emergence of damo bacteria 1 and the increased abundance of damo archaea in the biofilm this phenomenon meant that under the optimal operational conditions the longitudinal gradient in liquid phase substrates alone would not affect the tn removal but would influence the ch4 utilization by altering the biomass composition in the ch4 driven mbfr as no significant difference was noted between configurations with 3 and 5 compartments i e configuration 2 1 vs 2 2 and 3 1 vs 3 2 the number of compartments considered would not exert a direct impact on the global modeling results of the ch4 driven mbfr in the presence of a single longitudinal gradient 3 1 2 mbfr configurations with multiple longitudinal gradients when both longitudinal gradients in ch4 and liquid phase substrates were considered the tn removal remained above 99 0 with the co current flow of ch4 and wastewater i e configurations 4 1 4 2 in fig 2 however the ch4 utilization reached an efficiency of higher than 90 0 this enhancement resulted from the increased abundance of damo bacteria as compared to configurations 3 1 3 2 thus compromising the dominance of their competitor for nitrite i e anammox bacteria comparatively when ch4 and wastewater were supplied in opposite directions i e configurations 5 1 5 2 in fig 2 the tn removal was not significantly affected still 97 0 however the abundance of anammox bacteria was elevated while those of damo microorganisms were weakened damo bacteria even disappeared from the biofilm consequently compared to configurations 4 1 4 2 configurations 5 1 5 2 experienced a big drop in the ch4 utilization i e reaching 79 2 and 65 9 respectively these results showed that when multiple longitudinal gradients were present they became correlated and would jointly regulate the overall biomass composition and hence the ch4 utilization of the mbfr nevertheless they barely played significant roles in affecting the tn removal as evidenced by the simulation results of configurations 4 1 4 2 and 5 1 5 2 in fig 2 the number of compartments also impacted the simulated biomass composition and ch4 utilization of the mbfr when both longitudinal gradients were considered comparatively the tn removal efficiency was insensitive to the number of compartments considered 3 2 longitudinal profiles of different mbfr configurations to further demonstrate the differences between the mbfr configurations simulated in this work detailed longitudinal features i e between compartments in the longitudinal direction should be visualized 3 2 1 longitudinal gradients in gas phase and liquid phase components as indicated in fig 3 a f the expected longitudinal gradients in gas phase and liquid phase substrates i e ch4 flux nh4 n and no2 n were captured by the compartmental modeling approach even though a higher number of compartments considered in the model led to steeper longitudinal gradients the general trends remained comparable between modeling configurations with 3 and 5 compartments the only exception lay between configurations 4 1 and 4 2 for configuration 4 1 ch4 flux dropped consistently in the longitudinal direction from where methane was supplied hence the corresponding profile of dissolved ch4 in fig 3 g comparatively for configuration 4 2 ch4 flux first dropped significantly from compartment 1 to compartment 2 then increased in compartment 3 and finally decreased consistently until compartment 5 such a non monotonic trend gave rise to the corresponding profile of dissolved ch4 in fig 3 h i e the dissolved ch4 level peaked in compartment 2 instead of compartment 1 from which ch4 entered the mbfr the different profiles of dissolved ch4 between modeling configurations in fig 3 g and h largely explained the discrepancy in ch4 utilization efficiency between different modeling configurations in fig 2 in particular the high dissolved ch4 in compartment 5 of configuration 5 2 where gas phase ch4 entered the mbfr and liquid phase ch4 left the mbfr in fig 3 h caused the relatively low ch4 utilization efficiency as observed in fig 2 the abovementioned observations also confirmed the previous inference of the role of the number of compartments in affecting the simulated ch4 utilization of the mbfr when both longitudinal gradients were considered despite the similar profiles of nh4 n and no2 n the trend of no3 n formed varied significantly between modeling configurations in consideration of the longitudinal gradient in liquid phase substrates see fig 3 i and j for example no3 n was the highest in the first compartment of configurations 3 1 4 1 while the no3 n level peaked in the second compartment of configurations 3 2 4 2 the level of no3 n which was the major component in the effluent in the last compartment of all the modeling configurations but configuration 5 2 remained below 5 g n m 3 resulting in the tn removal efficiency of 99 0 as presented in fig 2 the distinct longitudinal profiles delineated in fig 3 were associated with the longitudinal biomass composition to uncover the exact correlations the corresponding longitudinal biomass profiles should be presented particularly for configurations 5 1 5 2 the disappearance of ch4 flux see fig 3 a and b and dissolved ch4 see fig 3 g and h in the direction of ch4 flow might indicate the washout of damo microorganisms in the last compartment s which needed to be verified 3 2 2 longitudinal biomass stratification as shown in fig 4 a and b the comparable biomass compositions for configurations 2 1 2 2 were not sensitive to the longitudinal gradient in ch4 leading to an overall biomass composition similar to that for the traditional modeling configuration of the ch4 driven mbfr i e configuration 1 in fig 2 considering the absence of ch4 flux in the last compartment s see fig 3 a and b the growth of damo microorganisms therein should be supported by the ch4 which came directly from the bulk liquid and essentially derived from the first compartment in the direction of ch4 flow the longitudinal gradient in liquid phase substrates i e configurations 3 1 3 2 in fig 4 c and d led to the longitudinal biomass stratification anammox bacteria represented the sole active microbial species i e 96 in the first compartment s of configurations 3 1 3 2 where the levels of both no2 n and nh4 n were high for configuration 3 2 the comparable microbial composition between compartments 1 and 2 contributed to the peak level of no3 n the product of the anammox process in compartment 2 see fig 3 j with the decreasing fluxes of no2 n and nh4 n towards the last compartment the fraction of anammox bacteria decreased comparatively the evenly supplied ch4 on top of the produced no3 n favored the growth of damo archaea as a result anammox bacteria and damo archaea jointly dominated the last compartment of configurations 3 1 3 2 with a minor abundance of damo bacteria such longitudinal biomass stratification not only brought about different overall biomass compositions from configurations 2 1 2 2 but also enhanced ch4 utilization resulting in higher utilization efficiencies see fig 2 these trends aligned with the previous inference of the impact of a single longitudinal gradient in ch4 or liquid phase substrates on the simulated results of the ch4 driven mbfr as shown in fig 4 e and f similar longitudinal biomass stratification to configurations 3 1 3 2 was observed for configurations 4 1 4 2 the absence of damo microorganisms suggested pure penetration of ch4 in the compartment s thus causing the slight increase in dissolved ch4 from compartment 1 to compartment 2 of configuration 4 2 see fig 3 h this unused portion of ch4 then diffused into the biofilm in the subsequent compartments and got consumed by damo microorganisms therein causing the decreasing dissolved ch4 level from compartment 1 to compartment 3 of configuration 4 1 see fig 3 g and from compartment 2 to compartment 5 of configuration 4 2 see fig 3 h the main difference from configurations 3 1 3 2 lay in the significant abundance of damo bacteria in the last compartment of configurations 4 1 4 2 this phenomenon was the result of the simultaneously low levels of nh4 n no3 n and ch4 flux which favored the growth of damo bacteria in the last compartment especially of configuration 4 2 with steeper gradients in both ch4 and liquid phase substrates the presence of damo bacteria further improved the ch4 utilization especially that of configuration 4 2 which reached 96 see fig 2 the decreasing total active biomass fraction in the longitudinal direction arose from the combined impact of multiple longitudinal gradients comparatively when ch4 and wastewater were supplied in opposite directions i e configurations 5 1 5 2 the lowest total active biomass fraction was in the middle compartment where no2 n nh4 n and ch4 as the substrates for anammox bacteria and damo microorganisms were simultaneously low such an observation tended to decrease the overall biomass fraction of the mbfr with the increasing number of compartments considered in the model which slightly affected the tn removal see fig 2 anammox bacteria as the nitrate producers were the sole active biomass in the first compartments s while damo archaea as the nitrate consumers were dominant in the last compartment s hence the observed profiles of no3 n in fig 3 i and j these results verified not only the correlated roles of both longitudinal gradients but also the visible role of the number of compartments in influencing the biomass composition and hence the ch4 utilization of the mbfr 3 3 mbfr configurations under suboptimal operational conditions 3 3 1 global features at suboptimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratios as delineated in fig 5 a the influent with a no2 n nh4 n ratio of 3 2 washed damo archaea out of the biofilm and led to the dominance of anammox bacteria and damo bacteria the resulting tn removal efficiency 84 0 which remained nearly the same across all the mbfr configurations was lower than the value obtained at the optimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 1 i e 97 0 in fig 2 comparatively an influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 2 3 induced a biofilm mainly occupied by damo archaea and anammox bacteria see fig 5 b compared to the simulations at the optimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 1 the tn removal efficiency herein was lower due to the depressed abundance of anammox bacteria but still stayed around 80 0 across all the mbfr configurations similar to the observations at the optimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 1 the longitudinal gradient in ch4 alone would not significantly affect the ch4 utilization efficiency when the ch4 driven mbfr was operated at the influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of either 3 2 i e configurations 2 1 2 2 in fig 5 a or 2 3 i e configurations 2 1 2 2 in fig 5 b moreover the longitudinal gradient in liquid phase substrates caused fluctuations in the biomass composition and therefore the dynamic ch4 utilization efficiency see configurations 3 1 3 2 4 1 4 2 5 1 5 2 in fig 5 what differed markedly from the simulations at the optimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 1 was that the number of compartments considered in this work didn t significantly affect the ch4 utilization of the mbfr at the suboptimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 3 2 see fig 5 a where sufficient ch4 usage i e 93 0 was guaranteed by the prevalence of damo bacteria in the biofilm 3 3 2 global features at suboptimal ch4 surface loadings as shown in fig 6 at the ch4 surface loadings tested in this work the mbfr configurations in consideration of a single longitudinal gradient in ch4 i e configurations 2 1 2 2 presented results similar to the traditional modeling configuration i e configuration 1 irrespective of the number of compartments considered the tn removal efficiency see fig 6 a and c firstly increased and then decreased with the increasing ch4 surface loading thus peaking at 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 in the studied range despite the decreased tn removal efficiency at the ch4 surface loadings of 0 192 and 0 256 g cod m 2 d 1 the ch4 utilization efficiency remained above 80 0 see fig 6 b and d this phenomenon resulted from the emerging dominance of damo bacteria at the expense of anammox bacteria see the relevant results of configurations 2 1 2 2 in supplementary table s5 si for the modeling configurations with at least the longitudinal gradient in liquid phase substrates i e configurations 3 1 3 2 4 1 4 2 5 1 5 2 the tn removal efficiency firstly increased with the increasing ch4 surface loading and then stayed above 97 0 at the ch4 surface loading of 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 see fig 6 a and c however the corresponding ch4 utilization efficiency in general exhibited a downward trend see fig 6 b and d the disappointing ch4 utilization i e 50 0 at the ch4 surface loadings of 0 192 and 0 256 g cod m 2 d 1 manifested the existence of a significant amount of dissolved ch4 in the effluent this observation was due to the disappearance of damo microorganisms in the first compartment s similar to fig 4 c h causing pure penetration of ch4 supplied from the membrane lumen into the bulk liquid the number of compartments considered in modeling also played a role in regulating the biomass composition see the relevant results in supplementary table s5 si and therefore created the noted discrepancies in the magnitude of ch4 utilization efficiency 4 discussion this work delivers the first attempt to systematically explore the influences of longitudinal heterogeneity on the ch4 driven mbfr performing anammox damo which has been deemed as a promising technology to achieve complete nitrogen removal from wastewater in addition to serving as a valuable reference for prospective related modeling research the simulation results obtained in this work would provide important guidance for better design operation and monitoring of the ch4 driven mbfr however it should be highlighted that the trends obtained in this work still need future experimental validation and were specific to the reactor settings and operational conditions studied which might not necessarily lead to the nitrogen removal capacity matching the literature reported high levels as evidenced in figs 2 and 5 the tn removal efficiency of the mbfr with optimal ch4 supply studied in this work was found to be insensitive to both longitudinal gradients in the liquid phase and the gas phase comparatively the longitudinal gradient in the liquid phase components could generally elevate the ch4 utilization efficiency except for the mbfr configuration with counter current flow of wastewater and ch4 i e configurations 5 1 5 2 considering the higher ch4 utilization i e less dissolved ch4 discharge in the effluent of configurations 4 1 4 2 than configurations 3 1 3 2 at limited or optimal ch4 supply see the results at the ch4 surface loading of 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 in fig 6 b and d the presence of both longitudinal gradients in the liquid phase and the gas phase in the mbfr with co current flow of wastewater and ch4 might be the most suitable configuration for the mbfr performing anammox damo however this inference wouldn t apply to the mbfr with excessive ch4 supply which led to low ch4 utilization despite sustained tn removal see fig 6 the mbfr is therefore recommended to be designed with both the biofilm reactor and the membrane lumen as pfrs and operated with non excessive ch4 supply to achieve the plug flow operation of the membrane lumen gas permeable membranes with a high mass transfer capacity across the membrane wall could be used to supply ch4 in the open end mode perez calleja et al 2017 thus allowing longitudinal drop in ch4 since the plug flow operation of the biofilm reactor is favored the pump driven continuous recirculation to create complete mixing of the bulk liquid applied by researchers nie et al 2020 xie et al 2017 xie et al 2018 might not be needed thus reducing the associated operational cost however periodic flushing should be added to not only avoid the potential clogging in the liquid phase but also control the biofilm growth even though such a setup might affect the flow pattern velocity of the bulk liquid and consequently the mass transfer between the bulk liquid and the biofilm the results of additional simulations performed by following the reported approach chen et al 2021 chen et al 2022 pan et al 2019 to manipulate the boundary layer thickness see supplementary fig s1 si proved its negligible impact on the overall performance of the mbfr studied in this work despite the protection of the biofilm structure the high influent no2 n concentration e g 250 g n m 3 which corresponds to a free nitrous acid level of 61 mg n m 3 might inhibit the activity of anammox bacteria dominating the beginning part of the biofilm in the direction of liquid flow in the mbfr with the plug flow operational mode see fig 4 e and f which warrants further experimental verification when monitoring the microbial evolution it should be sufficient to take representative samples randomly in the longitudinal direction in the ch4 driven mbfr with the biofilm reactor operated as a cstr e g nie et al 2020 xie et al 2017 xie et al 2018 considering the uniform longitudinal biomass composition therein see fig 4 a and b nevertheless for the ch4 driven mbfr with the biofilm reactor operated as a pfr see fig 4 c h an incorrect judgement on the microbial composition would be made if centralized sampling is performed in this case samples should be collected at multiple longitudinal locations e g sampling at the top middle and bottom when the membrane is placed vertically and mixed for the correct representation of the microbial composition the longitudinal heterogeneity in biomass composition led to differences in the overall nitrogen removal route contributed jointly by anammox and damo microorganisms and consequently the distinct tn removal and ch4 utilization observed from the modeling point of view the decision regarding the best configuration to adopt should be based on the specific properties of the liquid gas phases of the realistic ch4 driven mbfr in general it should be acceptable to apply the traditional modeling approach to evaluate the tn removal of the ch4 driven mbfr with non excessive ch4 supply however this finding is not consistent with what was reported for the analogous oxygen driven mbfr performing pn anammox by acevedo alonso and lackner 2019 and chen et al 2020 in the ch4 driven mbfr ch4 serves as the reducing agent in the damo processes which complement the anammox process for the ultimate nitrogen removal comparatively oxygen acts as the oxidizing agent in the precursory nitritation process which enables the anammox process to ultimately remove nitrogen in the oxygen driven mbfr however care should be taken when probing into the ch4 utilization in the ch4 driven mbfr in the mbfr configurations with the biofilm reactor as a pfr applying the traditional modeling approach might underestimate or overestimate the ch4 utilization efficiency at limited optimal or excessive ch4 supply respectively see fig 6 b and d moreover when simulating the biofilm reactor as a pfr using the compartmental modeling approach a decision should be made regarding the number of compartments i e the extent of reactor compartmentation to be considered even though this decision might to some extent affect the predicted ch4 utilization efficiency and wouldn t influence the global trends of the nitrogen removal ch4 utilization and microbial composition of the mbfr under varied operational conditions it would undoubtedly play a significant role in determining the actual computational time increasing the number of compartments would elevate the model complexity therefore requesting more time for execution 5 conclusions through comparing different reactor configurations simulated using the reported modified compartmental modeling approach the following conclusions regarding the impacts of longitudinal heterogeneity potentially present in the gas and liquid phases on the ch4 driven mbfr performing anammox damo were drawn the total nitrogen removal efficiency of the mbfr at non excessive ch4 supply e g surface loading of 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 in this work was found to be insensitive to both longitudinal gradients in the liquid and gas phases the longitudinal gradient in the liquid phase led to distinct longitudinal biomass stratification and therefore played an influential role in the effective ch4 utilization efficiency which was also related to the extent of reactor compartmentation considered in modeling when supplied with non excessive ch4 the mbfr is recommended to be designed operated with both the biofilm reactor and the membrane lumen as pfrs with co current flow of wastewater and ch4 which could mitigate dissolved ch4 discharge in the effluent for the reactor configurations with the biofilm reactor designed operated as a pfr multi spot sampling in the longitudinal direction is needed in order to obtain a correct representation of the microbial composition of the mbfr declaration

15824,integrating anammox with denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo in the membrane biofilm reactor mbfr is a promising technology capable of achieving complete nitrogen removal from wastewater however it remains unknown whether reactor configurations featuring longitudinal gradients parallel to the membrane surface would affect the performance of the ch4 driven mbfr to this end this work aims to study the impacts of longitudinal heterogeneity potentially present in the gas and liquid phases on a representative ch4 driven mbfr performing anammox damo by applying the reported modified compartmental modeling approach through comparing the modeling results of different reactor configurations this work not only offered important guidance for better design operation and monitoring of the ch4 driven mbfr but also revealed important implications for prospective related modeling research the total nitrogen removal efficiency of the mbfr at non excessive ch4 supply e g

anammox denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo longitudinal gradient membrane biofilm reactor mbfr modeling 1 introduction although the combination of partial nitritation pn and anammox has been recognized as a sustainable technology for removing nitrogen from wastewater its theoretical maximum removal efficiency is limited to 89 due to the indispensable no3 production from the anammox process strous et al 1998 the discovery of denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidation damo processes ettwig et al 2010 haroon et al 2013 raghoebarsing et al 2006 where damo archaea and damo bacteria the

alternative coupling pn anammox with damo enables complete nitrogen removal through making use of the ch4 directly produced on site of wastewater treatment plants wwtps implementing anaerobic digestion for excess sludge treatment and energy recovery considering the distinct microbial preferences for oxygen and the ease of operation it is particularly suitable to enforce such an integrated nitrogen removal technology in a two stage system consisting of a first stage pn reactor with the supply of air and a second stage ch4 driven anoxic reactor performing anammox damo due to the low solubility of ch4 e g 22 mg ch4 l at 1 atm and 20 c peng et al 2020 and the slow growth of both anammox bacteria and damo microorganisms jetten et al 1997 kampman et al 2012 the membrane biofilm reactor mbfr is an ideal reactor configuration to couple anammox with damo and retain sufficient mixed biomass in such a mbfr ch4 is provided from inside gas permeable membranes and subjected to cross phase mass transfer while the effluent of the first stage pn reactor mainly containing nh4 and no2 is supplied from the bulk liquid the separate provision of gas phase and liquid phase substrates results in the formation of controlled redox stratification of the biofilm harbouring anammox bacteria and damo microorganisms on the membrane surface as well as the efficient utilization of substrates within the biofilm nevertheless only limited efforts have been dedicated to the experimental demonstration of the mbfr coupling anammox with damo cai et al 2018 liu et al 2020b shi et al 2013 xie et al 2017 xie et al 2018 despite its evident technological advantages this is mainly due to the forefront uncertainties and difficulties associated with the design operation and monitoring of the mbfr in addition to the lack of knowledge on competitive and synergic interactions between the functional microorganisms involved in this sense mathematical modeling could serve as a powerful tool to comprehensively understand and evaluate the mbfr coupling anammox with damo however the reported modeling works in this regard chen et al 2014 chen et al 2016 liu et al 2020a peng et al 2020 were mainly in the traditional one dimensional 1d domain which only captured axial gradients within the biofilm i e perpendicular to the membrane surface and couldn t account for the potential occurrence of longitudinal gradients in the liquid phase or and the gas phase parallel to the membrane surface analogous longitudinal heterogeneity which has been documented in the literature for the oxygen driven mbfr martin and nerenberg 2012 perez calleja et al 2017 syron and casey 2008 has been proved to play a pivotal role from the modeling perspective acevedo alonso and lackner 2019 chen et al 2020 however the relevant conclusions obtained for the oxygen driven mbfr wouldn t apply to the ch4 driven mbfr due to the fundamental difference between the treatment mechanisms behind these two mbfr technologies i e pn anammox vs anammox damo therefore it is worthwhile to adopt a reliable modeling approach to verify the potential role of longitudinal heterogeneity in the ch4 driven mbfr to this end through applying the modified compartmental modeling approach reported by chen et al 2020 this work aims to systematically investigate the impacts of longitudinal gradients on the nitrogen removal performance effective ch4 utilization and microbial composition of the mbfr performing anammox damo this work would expectedly provide useful and practical guidance for better design operation and monitoring of the ch4 driven mbfr to achieve complete nitrogen removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 model framework the reported bioprocess model that describes the anammox and damo processes and has been reliably tested and verified against both long term and batch experimental data at 22 2 c and ph of 7 0 chen et al 2014 chen et al 2016 was directly adopted in this work since heterotrophic bacteria might also grow on the biomass decay products even in the absence of external organics supply the heterotrophic denitrification processes of activated sludge model no 1 at 20 c and neutral ph henze et al 2000 were included in the model as summarized in tables s1 and s2 in the supporting information si the model contains 10 bioprocesses depicting the interactions between the 4 guilds of

n2 are expressed in terms of nitrogen while the rest are unified in terms of chemical oxidation demand cod the monod type equations describe the kinetic control of all microbial growth rates the model parameters involved are listed in supplementary table s3 si 2 2 mbfr configurations a mbfr can essentially be seen as a biofilm reactor connected to a membrane lumen through gas permeable membranes depending on the specific reactor configurations and operational conditions there might be longitudinal gradients in the liquid phase or and the gas phase of the mbfr therefore both the membrane lumen and the biofilm reactor could be plug flow reactors pfrs the modified compartmental model reported by chen et al 2020 was thus adopted to enable the handy simulation of longitudinal heterogeneity in the commonly used modeling platform aquasim reichert 1998 as shown in table 1 in addition to the traditional modeling approach where both the membrane lumen and the biofilm reactor were modeled as continuously stirred tank reactors cstrs 4 types of mfbr configurations were designed to evaluate different combinations of longitudinal gradients in the gas and liquid phases of the mbfr as delineated in fig 1 a when the biofilm reactor needed to be simulated as a cstr the compartmental model first equally divided the biofilm reactor into a defined number m m n 1 of compartments including n biofilm reactor compartments and 1 mixed reactor compartment and then used diffusive links with a sufficiently high mass transfer rate to connect each biofilm reactor compartment to the mixed reactor compartment comparatively to simulate the biofilm reactor as a pfr all the biofilm reactor compartments were sequentially connected using advective links i e fig 1 b d diffusive links were used to simulate the ch4 supply from each of the advectively linked compartments of the membrane lumen as a pfr i e fig 1 a c and d to the corresponding compartment of the biofilm reactor by contrast the membrane lumen as a cstr was directly modeled using one single mixed reactor compartment i e fig 1 b which was connected to all the biofilm reactor compartments simultaneously by diffusive links it needs to be highlighted that both co current flow and counter current flow of ch4 and wastewater to the mbfr were explored in this work i e fig 1 c vs fig 1 d consistent with acevedo alonso and lackner 2019 and chen et al 2020 the direct longitudinal interaction between biofilms in different compartments wasn t considered in the modified compartmental model applied in this work as shown in table 1 to understand the influence of the extent of reactor compartmentation each type of mbfr configuration in consideration of longitudinal heterogeneity was tested in both 3 and 5 reactor compartments to ensure comparability all the different mbfr configurations were designed to be consistent in i the overall volume of the membrane lumen biofilm reactor and ii the overall mass transfer rate from the membrane lumen to the biofilm reactor 2 3 simulation conditions all the 5 types of mbfr configurations shown in table 1 were simulated with the reactor setup and optimal operational conditions previously reported for the ch4 driven mbfr performing anammox damo to achieve complete nitrogen removal from the side stream wastewater with a total nitrogen tn i e no2 n nh4 n concentration of 500 g n m 3 at the optimum influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 1 chen et al 2016 i total reactor volume of 1 m3 consisting of 0 96 m3 biofilm reactor and 0 04 m3 membrane lumen ii total biofilm area of 235 m2 iii ch4 loading of 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 determined by dividing the product of the supplied ch4 concentration and flowrate by the total biofilm area iv influent flow rate of 0 32

biofilm thickness distribution and vi overall mass transfer coefficient for ch4 of 0 278 m d 1 as tested by chen et al 2016 deviated operational conditions could compromise the treatment performance to further explore the role of longitudinal heterogeneity in the simulated ch4 driven mbfr suboptimal operational conditions were also tested by i adjusting the influent no2 n nh4 n ratio to 3 2 and 2 3 and ii varying the ch4 surface loading from 0 016 to 0 256 g cod m 2 d 1 through regulating the ch4 flowrate representing the reported conditions from limited to excessive ch4 supply by chen et al 2016 the detailed parameter settings used for model simulations are presented in supplementary table s4 si for each simulation scenario the initial concentrations of all the soluble components were assumed to be zero in the biofilm and the bulk liquid while each of the 4 functional microorganisms xan xda xdb and xhb and the abiotic organics xs xi was assumed to account for 20 of the initial particulate cod in the biofilm matrix all simulations were run to reach the steady state indicated by constant effluent concentrations biofilm thickness and microbial composition based on the steady state influent and effluent concentrations the tn removal efficiency was calculated using eq 1 given the formation of dissolved ch4 in the bulk liquid the ch4 utilization efficiency was calculated using eq 2 while a high tn removal efficiency should be pursued a low ch4 utilization efficiency corresponding to the discharge of a high fraction of ch4 supplied in the effluent should be avoided a high ch4 utilization efficiency was desired to reduce ch4 loss in the effluent rather than in the gas stream exiting the membrane lumen this was built on the following assumptions i the ch4 flux leaving the membrane lumen wasn t seen as a problem since it could be effectively recycled back into the membrane lumen to constitute the feed and ii gas back diffusion wasn t significant since the mbfr studied was operated in the open end mode perez calleja et al 2017 1 tn removal efficiency 1 s nh 4 out s no 2 out s no 3 out s nh 4 in s no 2 in 100 where snh4 in and sno2 in are the influent

table 1 are illustrated in fig 2 including the steady state tn removal efficiency ch4 utilization efficiency and overall biomass composition under the optimal operational conditions studied in this work the traditional modeling configuration of the ch4 driven mbfr with both the biofilm reactor and the membrane lumen as cstrs i e configuration 1 in fig 2 led to a tn removal efficiency of 98 9 which was slightly higher than the value i e 93 2 reported for a lab scale mbfr performing anammox damo without specific control over ch4 supply xie et al 2017 the accompanying ch4 utilization efficiency was 79 7 which was much lower than the value i e 96 0 documented by cai et al 2018 that tested the impact of ch4 supply on another lab scale mbfr performing anammox damo the noted discrepancy was ascribed to their provision of no3 n nh4 n as substrates at a ratio of 2 rather than no2 n nh4 n at a ratio of 1 in this work the oversupply of no3 n significantly strengthened the ch4 consumption by damo microorganisms especially damo archaea in the biofilm leading to elevated ch4 utilization overall anammox bacteria 74 and damo archaea 15 were the dominant species while damo bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria were not found in the biofilm the results for configuration 1 served as the benchmark for the following comparisons with other mbfr configurations in consideration of longitudinal heterogeneity 3 1 1 mbfr configurations with one single longitudinal gradient configurations 2 1 2 2 in fig 2 considered the longitudinal gradient in ch4 while the biofilm reactor remained a cstr however their tn removal ch4 utilization and overall biomass composition all remained nearly unchanged as compared to those of configuration 1 this observation indicated that under the optimal operational conditions studied in this work the longitudinal gradient in ch4 alone would not significantly affect the overall performance of the ch4 driven mbfr even though similar tn removal around 99 0 was observed for the simulated mbfr configurations with the membrane lumen as a cstr and the biofilm reactor as a pfr i e configurations 3 1 3 2 in fig 2 higher ch4 utilization over 85 0 was obtained as compared to configuration 1 due to both the emergence of damo bacteria 1 and the increased abundance of damo archaea in the biofilm this phenomenon meant that under the optimal operational conditions the longitudinal gradient in liquid phase substrates alone would not affect the tn removal but would influence the ch4 utilization by altering the biomass composition in the ch4 driven mbfr as no significant difference was noted between configurations with 3 and 5 compartments i e configuration 2 1 vs 2 2 and 3 1 vs 3 2 the number of compartments considered would not exert a direct impact on the global modeling results of the ch4 driven mbfr in the presence of a single longitudinal gradient 3 1 2 mbfr configurations with multiple longitudinal gradients when both longitudinal gradients in ch4 and liquid phase substrates were considered the tn removal remained above 99 0 with the co current flow of ch4 and wastewater i e configurations 4 1 4 2 in fig 2 however the ch4 utilization reached an efficiency of higher than 90 0 this enhancement resulted from the increased abundance of damo bacteria as compared to configurations 3 1 3 2 thus compromising the dominance of their competitor for nitrite i e anammox bacteria comparatively when ch4 and wastewater were supplied in opposite directions i e configurations 5 1 5 2 in fig 2 the tn removal was not significantly affected still 97 0 however the abundance of anammox bacteria was elevated while those of damo microorganisms were weakened damo bacteria even disappeared from the biofilm consequently compared to configurations 4 1 4 2 configurations 5 1 5 2 experienced a big drop in the ch4 utilization i e reaching 79 2 and 65 9 respectively these results showed that when multiple longitudinal gradients were present they became correlated and would jointly regulate the overall biomass composition and hence the ch4 utilization of the mbfr nevertheless they barely played significant roles in affecting the tn removal as evidenced by the simulation results of configurations 4 1 4 2 and 5 1 5 2 in fig 2 the number of compartments also impacted the simulated biomass composition and ch4 utilization of the mbfr when both longitudinal gradients were considered comparatively the tn removal efficiency was insensitive to the number of compartments considered 3 2 longitudinal profiles of different mbfr configurations to further demonstrate the differences between the mbfr configurations simulated in this work detailed longitudinal features i e between compartments in the longitudinal direction should be visualized 3 2 1 longitudinal gradients in gas phase and liquid phase components as indicated in fig 3 a f the expected longitudinal gradients in gas phase and liquid phase substrates i e ch4 flux nh4 n and no2 n were captured by the compartmental modeling approach even though a higher number of compartments considered in the model led to steeper longitudinal gradients the general trends remained comparable between modeling configurations with 3 and 5 compartments the only exception lay between configurations 4 1 and 4 2 for configuration 4 1 ch4 flux dropped consistently in the longitudinal direction from where methane was supplied hence the corresponding profile of dissolved ch4 in fig 3 g comparatively for configuration 4 2 ch4 flux first dropped significantly from compartment 1 to compartment 2 then increased in compartment 3 and finally decreased consistently until compartment 5 such a non monotonic trend gave rise to the corresponding profile of dissolved ch4 in fig 3 h i e the dissolved ch4 level peaked in compartment 2 instead of compartment 1 from which ch4 entered the mbfr the different profiles of dissolved ch4 between modeling configurations in fig 3 g and h largely explained the discrepancy in ch4 utilization efficiency between different modeling configurations in fig 2 in particular the high dissolved ch4 in compartment 5 of configuration 5 2 where gas phase ch4 entered the mbfr and liquid phase ch4 left the mbfr in fig 3 h caused the relatively low ch4 utilization efficiency as observed in fig 2 the abovementioned observations also confirmed the previous inference of the role of the number of compartments in affecting the simulated ch4 utilization of the mbfr when both longitudinal gradients were considered despite the similar profiles of nh4 n and no2 n the trend of no3 n formed varied significantly between modeling configurations in consideration of the longitudinal gradient in liquid phase substrates see fig 3 i and j for example no3 n was the highest in the first compartment of configurations 3 1 4 1 while the no3 n level peaked in the second compartment of configurations 3 2 4 2 the level of no3 n which was the major component in the effluent in the last compartment of all the modeling configurations but configuration 5 2 remained below 5 g n m 3 resulting in the tn removal efficiency of 99 0 as presented in fig 2 the distinct longitudinal profiles delineated in fig 3 were associated with the longitudinal biomass composition to uncover the exact correlations the corresponding longitudinal biomass profiles should be presented particularly for configurations 5 1 5 2 the disappearance of ch4 flux see fig 3 a and b and dissolved ch4 see fig 3 g and h in the direction of ch4 flow might indicate the washout of damo microorganisms in the last compartment s which needed to be verified 3 2 2 longitudinal biomass stratification as shown in fig 4 a and b the comparable biomass compositions for configurations 2 1 2 2 were not sensitive to the longitudinal gradient in ch4 leading to an overall biomass composition similar to that for the traditional modeling configuration of the ch4 driven mbfr i e configuration 1 in fig 2 considering the absence of ch4 flux in the last compartment s see fig 3 a and b the growth of damo microorganisms therein should be supported by the ch4 which came directly from the bulk liquid and essentially derived from the first compartment in the direction of ch4 flow the longitudinal gradient in liquid phase substrates i e configurations 3 1 3 2 in fig 4 c and d led to the longitudinal biomass stratification anammox bacteria represented the sole active microbial species i e 96 in the first compartment s of configurations 3 1 3 2 where the levels of both no2 n and nh4 n were high for configuration 3 2 the comparable microbial composition between compartments 1 and 2 contributed to the peak level of no3 n the product of the anammox process in compartment 2 see fig 3 j with the decreasing fluxes of no2 n and nh4 n towards the last compartment the fraction of anammox bacteria decreased comparatively the evenly supplied ch4 on top of the produced no3 n favored the growth of damo archaea as a result anammox bacteria and damo archaea jointly dominated the last compartment of configurations 3 1 3 2 with a minor abundance of damo bacteria such longitudinal biomass stratification not only brought about different overall biomass compositions from configurations 2 1 2 2 but also enhanced ch4 utilization resulting in higher utilization efficiencies see fig 2 these trends aligned with the previous inference of the impact of a single longitudinal gradient in ch4 or liquid phase substrates on the simulated results of the ch4 driven mbfr as shown in fig 4 e and f similar longitudinal biomass stratification to configurations 3 1 3 2 was observed for configurations 4 1 4 2 the absence of damo microorganisms suggested pure penetration of ch4 in the compartment s thus causing the slight increase in dissolved ch4 from compartment 1 to compartment 2 of configuration 4 2 see fig 3 h this unused portion of ch4 then diffused into the biofilm in the subsequent compartments and got consumed by damo microorganisms therein causing the decreasing dissolved ch4 level from compartment 1 to compartment 3 of configuration 4 1 see fig 3 g and from compartment 2 to compartment 5 of configuration 4 2 see fig 3 h the main difference from configurations 3 1 3 2 lay in the significant abundance of damo bacteria in the last compartment of configurations 4 1 4 2 this phenomenon was the result of the simultaneously low levels of nh4 n no3 n and ch4 flux which favored the growth of damo bacteria in the last compartment especially of configuration 4 2 with steeper gradients in both ch4 and liquid phase substrates the presence of damo bacteria further improved the ch4 utilization especially that of configuration 4 2 which reached 96 see fig 2 the decreasing total active biomass fraction in the longitudinal direction arose from the combined impact of multiple longitudinal gradients comparatively when ch4 and wastewater were supplied in opposite directions i e configurations 5 1 5 2 the lowest total active biomass fraction was in the middle compartment where no2 n nh4 n and ch4 as the substrates for anammox bacteria and damo microorganisms were simultaneously low such an observation tended to decrease the overall biomass fraction of the mbfr with the increasing number of compartments considered in the model which slightly affected the tn removal see fig 2 anammox bacteria as the nitrate producers were the sole active biomass in the first compartments s while damo archaea as the nitrate consumers were dominant in the last compartment s hence the observed profiles of no3 n in fig 3 i and j these results verified not only the correlated roles of both longitudinal gradients but also the visible role of the number of compartments in influencing the biomass composition and hence the ch4 utilization of the mbfr 3 3 mbfr configurations under suboptimal operational conditions 3 3 1 global features at suboptimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratios as delineated in fig 5 a the influent with a no2 n nh4 n ratio of 3 2 washed damo archaea out of the biofilm and led to the dominance of anammox bacteria and damo bacteria the resulting tn removal efficiency 84 0 which remained nearly the same across all the mbfr configurations was lower than the value obtained at the optimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 1 i e 97 0 in fig 2 comparatively an influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 2 3 induced a biofilm mainly occupied by damo archaea and anammox bacteria see fig 5 b compared to the simulations at the optimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 1 the tn removal efficiency herein was lower due to the depressed abundance of anammox bacteria but still stayed around 80 0 across all the mbfr configurations similar to the observations at the optimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 1 the longitudinal gradient in ch4 alone would not significantly affect the ch4 utilization efficiency when the ch4 driven mbfr was operated at the influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of either 3 2 i e configurations 2 1 2 2 in fig 5 a or 2 3 i e configurations 2 1 2 2 in fig 5 b moreover the longitudinal gradient in liquid phase substrates caused fluctuations in the biomass composition and therefore the dynamic ch4 utilization efficiency see configurations 3 1 3 2 4 1 4 2 5 1 5 2 in fig 5 what differed markedly from the simulations at the optimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 1 1 was that the number of compartments considered in this work didn t significantly affect the ch4 utilization of the mbfr at the suboptimal influent no2 n nh4 n ratio of 3 2 see fig 5 a where sufficient ch4 usage i e 93 0 was guaranteed by the prevalence of damo bacteria in the biofilm 3 3 2 global features at suboptimal ch4 surface loadings as shown in fig 6 at the ch4 surface loadings tested in this work the mbfr configurations in consideration of a single longitudinal gradient in ch4 i e configurations 2 1 2 2 presented results similar to the traditional modeling configuration i e configuration 1 irrespective of the number of compartments considered the tn removal efficiency see fig 6 a and c firstly increased and then decreased with the increasing ch4 surface loading thus peaking at 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 in the studied range despite the decreased tn removal efficiency at the ch4 surface loadings of 0 192 and 0 256 g cod m 2 d 1 the ch4 utilization efficiency remained above 80 0 see fig 6 b and d this phenomenon resulted from the emerging dominance of damo bacteria at the expense of anammox bacteria see the relevant results of configurations 2 1 2 2 in supplementary table s5 si for the modeling configurations with at least the longitudinal gradient in liquid phase substrates i e configurations 3 1 3 2 4 1 4 2 5 1 5 2 the tn removal efficiency firstly increased with the increasing ch4 surface loading and then stayed above 97 0 at the ch4 surface loading of 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 see fig 6 a and c however the corresponding ch4 utilization efficiency in general exhibited a downward trend see fig 6 b and d the disappointing ch4 utilization i e 50 0 at the ch4 surface loadings of 0 192 and 0 256 g cod m 2 d 1 manifested the existence of a significant amount of dissolved ch4 in the effluent this observation was due to the disappearance of damo microorganisms in the first compartment s similar to fig 4 c h causing pure penetration of ch4 supplied from the membrane lumen into the bulk liquid the number of compartments considered in modeling also played a role in regulating the biomass composition see the relevant results in supplementary table s5 si and therefore created the noted discrepancies in the magnitude of ch4 utilization efficiency 4 discussion this work delivers the first attempt to systematically explore the influences of longitudinal heterogeneity on the ch4 driven mbfr performing anammox damo which has been deemed as a promising technology to achieve complete nitrogen removal from wastewater in addition to serving as a valuable reference for prospective related modeling research the simulation results obtained in this work would provide important guidance for better design operation and monitoring of the ch4 driven mbfr however it should be highlighted that the trends obtained in this work still need future experimental validation and were specific to the reactor settings and operational conditions studied which might not necessarily lead to the nitrogen removal capacity matching the literature reported high levels as evidenced in figs 2 and 5 the tn removal efficiency of the mbfr with optimal ch4 supply studied in this work was found to be insensitive to both longitudinal gradients in the liquid phase and the gas phase comparatively the longitudinal gradient in the liquid phase components could generally elevate the ch4 utilization efficiency except for the mbfr configuration with counter current flow of wastewater and ch4 i e configurations 5 1 5 2 considering the higher ch4 utilization i e less dissolved ch4 discharge in the effluent of configurations 4 1 4 2 than configurations 3 1 3 2 at limited or optimal ch4 supply see the results at the ch4 surface loading of 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 in fig 6 b and d the presence of both longitudinal gradients in the liquid phase and the gas phase in the mbfr with co current flow of wastewater and ch4 might be the most suitable configuration for the mbfr performing anammox damo however this inference wouldn t apply to the mbfr with excessive ch4 supply which led to low ch4 utilization despite sustained tn removal see fig 6 the mbfr is therefore recommended to be designed with both the biofilm reactor and the membrane lumen as pfrs and operated with non excessive ch4 supply to achieve the plug flow operation of the membrane lumen gas permeable membranes with a high mass transfer capacity across the membrane wall could be used to supply ch4 in the open end mode perez calleja et al 2017 thus allowing longitudinal drop in ch4 since the plug flow operation of the biofilm reactor is favored the pump driven continuous recirculation to create complete mixing of the bulk liquid applied by researchers nie et al 2020 xie et al 2017 xie et al 2018 might not be needed thus reducing the associated operational cost however periodic flushing should be added to not only avoid the potential clogging in the liquid phase but also control the biofilm growth even though such a setup might affect the flow pattern velocity of the bulk liquid and consequently the mass transfer between the bulk liquid and the biofilm the results of additional simulations performed by following the reported approach chen et al 2021 chen et al 2022 pan et al 2019 to manipulate the boundary layer thickness see supplementary fig s1 si proved its negligible impact on the overall performance of the mbfr studied in this work despite the protection of the biofilm structure the high influent no2 n concentration e g 250 g n m 3 which corresponds to a free nitrous acid level of 61 mg n m 3 might inhibit the activity of anammox bacteria dominating the beginning part of the biofilm in the direction of liquid flow in the mbfr with the plug flow operational mode see fig 4 e and f which warrants further experimental verification when monitoring the microbial evolution it should be sufficient to take representative samples randomly in the longitudinal direction in the ch4 driven mbfr with the biofilm reactor operated as a cstr e g nie et al 2020 xie et al 2017 xie et al 2018 considering the uniform longitudinal biomass composition therein see fig 4 a and b nevertheless for the ch4 driven mbfr with the biofilm reactor operated as a pfr see fig 4 c h an incorrect judgement on the microbial composition would be made if centralized sampling is performed in this case samples should be collected at multiple longitudinal locations e g sampling at the top middle and bottom when the membrane is placed vertically and mixed for the correct representation of the microbial composition the longitudinal heterogeneity in biomass composition led to differences in the overall nitrogen removal route contributed jointly by anammox and damo microorganisms and consequently the distinct tn removal and ch4 utilization observed from the modeling point of view the decision regarding the best configuration to adopt should be based on the specific properties of the liquid gas phases of the realistic ch4 driven mbfr in general it should be acceptable to apply the traditional modeling approach to evaluate the tn removal of the ch4 driven mbfr with non excessive ch4 supply however this finding is not consistent with what was reported for the analogous oxygen driven mbfr performing pn anammox by acevedo alonso and lackner 2019 and chen et al 2020 in the ch4 driven mbfr ch4 serves as the reducing agent in the damo processes which complement the anammox process for the ultimate nitrogen removal comparatively oxygen acts as the oxidizing agent in the precursory nitritation process which enables the anammox process to ultimately remove nitrogen in the oxygen driven mbfr however care should be taken when probing into the ch4 utilization in the ch4 driven mbfr in the mbfr configurations with the biofilm reactor as a pfr applying the traditional modeling approach might underestimate or overestimate the ch4 utilization efficiency at limited optimal or excessive ch4 supply respectively see fig 6 b and d moreover when simulating the biofilm reactor as a pfr using the compartmental modeling approach a decision should be made regarding the number of compartments i e the extent of reactor compartmentation to be considered even though this decision might to some extent affect the predicted ch4 utilization efficiency and wouldn t influence the global trends of the nitrogen removal ch4 utilization and microbial composition of the mbfr under varied operational conditions it would undoubtedly play a significant role in determining the actual computational time increasing the number of compartments would elevate the model complexity therefore requesting more time for execution 5 conclusions through comparing different reactor configurations simulated using the reported modified compartmental modeling approach the following conclusions regarding the impacts of longitudinal heterogeneity potentially present in the gas and liquid phases on the ch4 driven mbfr performing anammox damo were drawn the total nitrogen removal efficiency of the mbfr at non excessive ch4 supply e g surface loading of 0 064 g cod m 2 d 1 in this work was found to be insensitive to both longitudinal gradients in the liquid and gas phases the longitudinal gradient in the liquid phase led to distinct longitudinal biomass stratification and therefore played an influential role in the effective ch4 utilization efficiency which was also related to the extent of reactor compartmentation considered in modeling when supplied with non excessive ch4 the mbfr is recommended to be designed operated with both the biofilm reactor and the membrane lumen as pfrs with co current flow of wastewater and ch4 which could mitigate dissolved ch4 discharge in the effluent for the reactor configurations with the biofilm reactor designed operated as a pfr multi spot sampling in the longitudinal direction is needed in order to obtain a correct representation of the microbial composition of the mbfr declaration
