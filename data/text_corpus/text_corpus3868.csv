19340,phosphorus p recovery from waste streams is attracting more attention due to the twin problems of aquatic eutrophication and global phosphorus scarcity layered double hydroxide mineral materials are promising phosphate adsorbents due to their excellent anion exchange abilities and large surface area in this study the adsorption isotherms estimated the saturation capacity of calcined layered double hydroxide ldh nano composites for phosphate as 100 7 mg p g adsorbent ion exchange is proposed as the major mechanism in the sorption process the commonly utilized desorption method via sodium hydroxide was found to cause recrystallization of ldh particles in increased crystal size based on the dissolution reprecipitation d r mechanism ammonia solution was used to desorb p from ldh adsorbent however struvite crystallization occurred during the desorption process because struvite has a higher precipitation tendency than ldh with sufficient nh4 ions the comparison of p leaching behavior among p adsorbed ldh ammonia treated ldh and pure struvite samples demonstrates that ammonia desorption probably weakened the interaction between phosphate species and ldh cationic layers thus enhancing the bioavailability of p in ldh adsorbents the ammonia treated ldh has a high potential to serve like struvite as a p slow releasing fertilizer graphical abstract image 1 keywords phosphorus recovery layered double hydroxides desorption struvite fertilizer 1 introduction phosphorus p is the limiting nutrient for the growth of phytoplankton in most freshwater bodies excess phosphorus discharged into nature water could cause eutrophication schindler et al 2008 ragsdale 2007 effective removal of p from effluent plays an important role in the control of eutrophication conventional p removal technologies have attained satisfactory performances in p elimination but facing challenges in further reducing p level in effluent to meet increasingly stringent p discharge thresholds as well as achieving nutrient recycling mayer et al 2013 usepa 1998 blaney et al 2007 meanwhile phosphorus fertilizer production is highly dependent on mining of phosphorus rock which is a nonrenewable resource the looming p scarcity crisis is a major challenge for the global food supply childers et al 2011 rittmann et al 2011 because of the double pressure of the problems eutrophication and an unsustainable phosphorus supply techniques for p recovery from waste streams have been widely studied and developed in recent years mehta et al 2015 divided the nutrient recovery pathway into three processes nutrient accumulation nutrient release and nutrient extraction current established p recovery technologies focus on one or two of these processes there has been little integrative design that considers all of three for example struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o precipitation technology the most established of these technologies performs well in nutrient extraction because its precipitation product can be directly used as a high quality p slow releasing fertilizer comparable to commercial fertilizers rittmann et al 2011 johnston and richards 2003 le corre et al 2009 however struvite crystallization requires a relatively high p content 50 ppm p which is unsuitable for most waste streams in contrast adsorption technology is promising in its p accumulation ability but extracting p from used adsorbents and transferring it into valuable products remains challenging mehta et al 2015 donnert and salecker 1999 goh et al 2008 layered double hydroxides ldhs also known as hydrotalcite like compounds are a family of synthetic clay materials which have been reported to be promising anion adsorbents goh et al 2008 they are generally represented by the formula mii 1 xmiii x oh 2 x an x n yh2o where mii and miii are metal ions an is the interlayer anion and x is between 0 17 and 0 33 duan and evans 2006 kwon et al 1988 the crystal structure of ldhs is based on a brucite like layer structure in which a fraction of the divalent cations mii are replaced by trivalent cations miii resulting in positively charged octahedral sheets sato et al 1986 lagaly and beneke 1991 to neutralize positive charge the interlayer region is intercalated with exchangeable anions and water molecules which makes ldhs an efficient adsorbent material with high anion exchange capacity aec calcination was found to improve the adsorption performances of carbonate intercalating ldh adsorbent as carbonate ions with strong affinity to the metal layers were decomposed during thermal treatment and the reconstruction process known as the memory effect assisted the adsorption of anions onto ldhs goswamee et al 1998 lazaridis 2003 parker et al 1995 series of calcined ldhs demonstrated a high p uptake level in previous research kuzawa et al 2006 triantafyllidis et al 2010 cheng et al 2009 das et al 2006 calcined mg al ldh with mg al molar ratio at 2 was reported by das et al 2006 to be the most efficient phosphate adsorption material among commonly utilized ldhs particularly ultrathin mg al ldh nanosheets with calcination showed superior p eliminating ability toward low content phosphate solution attaining p removal ratio of 93 5 from 2 mg p l of phosphate solution zhan et al 2016 despite extensive attention paid to adsorption performance however there have been few studies of the desorption behavior of phosphate from ldhs and of recovering desorbed phosphorus as fertilizer which are actually the most challenging and costly parts of a complete nutrient recovery system goh et al 2008 kuzawa et al 2006 reported that the adsorption amount of p onto mg al ldh decreased to 70 of initial level after four running cycles using a solution of 3 w v naoh 10 w v nacl to perform the desorption and a solution of 25 w v mgcl2 to operate regeneration cheng et al 2009 also indicated that around 60 of zn al ldh was regenerated after six cycles of desorption with a solution of 5 wt naoh moreover a further increase in the concentration of sodium hydroxide may cause the dissolution of aluminum in an alkaline environment which significantly restricts the usable life of ldh adsorbents palmer et al 2009 radha et al 2005 given these issues torres dorante et al 2009 koilraj et al 2013 everaert et al 2016 proposed the novel idea of directly applying nutrient loaded ldh material as a slow releasing fertilizer on the basis of an evaluation of nutrient bioavailability in ldhs in this study p loaded mg al ldh was desorbed by ammonia solution resulting in the simultaneous formation of struvite the achieved solid mixture was confirmed to have similar p releasing properties to pure struvite precipitates in this way adsorption and struvite crystallization technologies were combined to realize effective p recovery from waste streams and obtain high quality outflow this study proposes in short an innovative p recovery route to use treated adsorbents which contain high nutrient content as agricultural fertilizer this route offers an alternative avenue for resource recycling from waste streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of calcined mg al ldh nanocomposites carbonate intercalated mg al ldh was first prepared according to the co precipitation method described by chatelet et al 1996 a 500 ml solution containing 0 94 m na2co3 and 3 50 m naoh was added drop by drop into a vigorously stirred solution containing 1 m mg no3 2 6h2o and 0 5 m al no3 3 9h2o mg al at the molar ratio of 2 0 the resulting slurry was heated at 65 5 c and continuously stirred for 18 h followed by repeated centrifugation and washing with deionized di water it was then dried using a vacuum freezing drier the fine white powders obtained this way were thermally treated at 200 500 c for 10 h and finally the particles that passed through a 100 mesh screen were collected for the subsequent adsorption experiments 2 2 adsorption experiments all adsorption experiments described in this work were performed at room temperature of 25 1 c kh2po4 of chemical purity was dissolved in di water to prepare the p containing solution the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were studied in batch experiments with the same solid to liquid ratio at 2 g 1 l kinetic data were determined for two initial phosphorus concentrations 25 ppm p and 50 ppm p at a solution ph of 6 50 the supernatant was sampled at various time intervals up to 3 h reaction time phosphorus concentrations in the samples were measured by uv spectrophotometry at 700 nm using the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method the adsorption isotherm was studied for a wide range of initial p concentrations ranging from 10 ppm p to 1000 ppm p at ph 6 5 by adding 0 1 g adsorbents into a 50 ml solution shaken for 24 h to ensure the attainment of reaction equilibrium centrifugation and filtration were subsequently carried out and p in the supernatant was also measured by the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method 2 3 desorption experiments for desorption studies 300 c calcined mg al ldh was dispersed in kh2po4 solution with p initial concentration at 500 ppm shaken for 24 h to prepare mg al ldh with high p uptake level the obtained adsorbent was filtered washed with di water and dried using the vacuum drying method the dry powder samples were subsequently distributed in naoh and ammonia solutions at various concentrations and allowed to react for 24 h to examine the desorption properties to achieve concentrated p solutions a high solid to liquid ratio 1 g 100 ml was applied in desorption experiments except that different solid to liquid ratios were tested for ammonia desorption solid and liquid samples were separated and collected for subsequent analysis in the same way as in the adsorption experiments 2 4 phosphorus release experiments to examine the possibility of using mg al ldh products as fertilizer leaching experiments with p loaded adsorbent nh3 h2o desorbed adsorbent and pure struvite samples were performed in di water the releasing kinetics of phosphate magnesium and aluminum ions were measured by dosing 0 1 g of solid powders into 10 ml of di water according to the described dosage of 1 w w in fertilizer testing chen et al 2006 the concentrations of magnesium and aluminum were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkin elmer optima 8000 2 5 characterization methods the diffraction data of selected solid samples were collected using powder x ray diffraction pxrd bruker d8 diffractometer equipped with a cupper x ray tube with a step size of 0 02 phase analysis was performed according to the standard powder diffraction database of the international centre for diffraction data icdd pdf 2 release 2008 additionally struvite weight percentage in precipitates was determined via the rietveld refinement method using topas 4 2 software bruker mannheim germany morphology observation of the adsorbent was conducted via scanning electron microscopy hitachi s 4800 feg and transmission electron microscopy fei tecnai g2 20 s twin tem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was carried out on a multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer thermo escalab 250xi with monochromatic al kα x ray radiation 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characterization of mg al ldh nanocomposites the representative morphology of as prepared mg al co3 ldh nanocomposite is shown in fig 1 a left the tem image reveals the nanoscale of synthesized ldh particles which were irregular in shape with an average size of around 50 nm combined with the sharp peaks in xrd patterns see fig 1a right the tem image also indicates that the prepared ldh sample was highly crystallized the xrd peaks were identified as the hydrotalcite phase according to the standard diffraction pattern of pdf 89 0460 taken from icsd inorganic crystal structure database the hkl s of the major peaks are indexed on the basis of space group r 3m no 166 among which the d spacing of peak 003 reflection d003 is a significant indicator for the interlayer distance of ldh crystal as the cell lattice parameter c 3d003 triantafyllidis et al 2010 cavani et al 1991 indicated that the intercalated carbonate ions in ldhs are linked to the hydroxyl groups of adjacent brucite like sheets directly or through h2o molecules by a hydrogen bridge in the forms of oh co3 ho or oh h2o co3 ho the flat distribution and the loose bonding to cationic layers mean that carbonate ions and h2o molecules can be eliminated from ldh without ruining the structure hence the calcined ldh material normally has the same or better adsorption properties compared with untreated ldh material due to the process of structural reconstruction in adsorption pre experiments see fig s1 in supporting information mg al ldh that was thermally treated at 300 c showed the best p removal performance and thus was used as the adsorbent in the subsequent experiments fig 1b left presents the tem image of the 300 c calcined ldh sample showing that the morphology of particles changed slightly after calcination and particles were linked with each other after thermal treatment the xrd pattern of calcined ldh as shown in fig 1b right was completely different from that of as prepared ldh the sharp peaks of the hydrotalcite phase disappeared indicating the collapse of the original crystal structure however several humps corresponding to the magnesium oxide phase icsd pdf 45 0946 appeared in the highly amorphous sample which shows that the brucite layer structure remained in the thermal treatment additionally no aluminum phases were observed in the calcined ldh which confirmed that al3 cations were uniformly distributed in the magnesium oxide matrix crepaldi et al 2002 3 2 sorption kinetics and isotherm an adsorption kinetic study of calcined mg al ldh in kh2po4 solutions with different p initial concentrations was carried out and the results are shown in fig 2 a the reactions almost reached equilibrium within 2 h for different phosphate loadings the reduction of initial p concentration of solutions caused a decrease in p adsorption amount onto ldh adsorbent and also affected the contact time to reach equilibrium thus the pseudo second order model is more suitable for describing p adsorption onto mg al ldh as the half life adsorption time for a first order kinetic reaction should remain constant regardless of the initial adsorbate concentration reddad et al 2002 additionally to identify the adsorption behavior of rehydrated ldh which might work based on a different adsorption mechanism from calcined ldh the kinetic data of rehydrated ldh were also collected before performing the adsorption experiment the 300 c calcined ldh was immersed in deionized water with shaking for adequate rehydration according to the xrd patterns in fig s2 the rehydrated ldh was completely restored to hydrotalcite crystalline structure with water molecules and or hydroxide ions intercalated between cationic sheets the final p adsorption amount of rehydrated ldh was lower than that of calcined ldh under the same experimental condition the different p loading in rehydrated and calcined ldh is likely due to the decreased surface adsorption and the lack of structure reconstruction of rehydrated ldh morimoto et al 2012 the kinetics data of calcined ldh were fitted by a pseudo second order kinetic model as shown in fig 2b the linear formula of the pseudo second order kinetic model is as follows 1 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where t is the reaction time min q t mg p g and q e mg p g are the adsorbed p quantity at time t and equilibrium and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the rate constant of the adsorption the calculated values of q e from the pseudo second order kinetic model were 12 45 mg g for 25 ppm solution and 24 21 mg g for 50 ppm solution which are quite close to experimental data besides the good linearity in fig 2b indicates the suitability of the pseudo second order model which is used to describe the chemisorption process involving ion exchange ho 2006 for the adsorption process in this study the fitting result suggests that ion exchange plays a major role in phosphate sorption onto calcined ldh the intraparticle diffusion was reported to be the rate limiting step within the ion exchange process halajnia et al 2013 fig 3 a and b presents the adsorption isotherms of phosphorus to calcined mg al ldh at room temperature fitted with langmuir and freundlich models the linear formulas of the langmuir and freundlich equations are presented in eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 2 c e q e 1 b q m c e q m 3 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where c e mg l is the p concentration at equilibrium q e mg g is the corresponding p adsorption amount q m mg g and b l mg are the langmuir constants indicating saturation capacity and adsorption affinity respectively and k f and n are the freundlich constants additionally there is a significant dimensionless constant r l calculated from langmuir constant b reflecting whether the adsorption is favorable foo and hameed 2010 weber and chakravorti 1974 4 r l 1 1 b c 0 where c 0 is the initial concentration of adsorbate solution the adsorption nature is unfavorable when r l 1 favorable when 0 r l 1 and irreversible when r l 0 both models exhibit an acceptable fit for the experimental data while the correlation coefficient r2 0 97 of the freundlich fit is marginally better than that of the langmuir fit r2 0 96 the langmuir constant b is calculated as 0 0097 l mg hence the r l value will be located in the range of 0 1 within a wide p initial concentration which suggests that the adsorption nature of phosphorus species onto calcined mg al ldh is favorable additionally the maximum adsorption capacity q m of calcined ldh achieved from langmuir fitting is around 100 7 mg p g which is quite high among the reported capacities of ldh type phosphorus sorbents according to the summary of wendling et al 2013 this result can presumably be attributed to the nanoscale size of the adsorbent and to the highly porous structure enhanced by freeze drying process on the basis of batch adsorption experiments calcined mg al ldh showed great potential for phosphorus extraction from waste streams 3 3 the desorption properties of p loaded mg al ldh though several studies have reported the adsorption behavior of p onto ldh type materials few studies have focused on the related desorption performance however desorption and regeneration are the most challenging and costly part of adsorption technology and may account for more than 70 of the total operation costs goh et al 2008 alkaline solutions salt solutions at high concentrations and their mixtures are commonly utilized to desorb p from ldh adsorbents table 1 summarizes desorption and regeneration performances of p from ldhs under various experimental conditions sodium hydroxide naoh solution was the most frequently utilized method for p desorption from ldhs in this study naoh solution at different concentrations ranging from 0 001 m to 1 0 m was applied in the elution experiment and the results are shown in fig 4 a the phosphorus desorption ratio was calculated by the following equation 5 p desorption ratio c v x 100 where c mg l is the p concentration in desorption solution v l is the volume of eluting solution and x mg is the adsorbed p amount mg in used ldh adsorbent the p desorption ratio grows continuously with the increase of naoh concentration and the speed of growth slows down when the concentration of naoh reaches 0 1 m the maximum p desorbing fraction is 69 with the concentration of naoh at 1 0 m this desorbing efficiency is lower than recorded in previous studies due to the high solid to liquid ratio according to he et al 2006 anions with higher charge density and smaller ionic radii have stronger affinity to brucite like sheets of ldhs and thus oh ions are in particularly strong interaction with the cationic layer of ldhs with a high concentration of naoh solution oh ions intercalate into the ldhs and substitute for phosphate anions to extract p from the adsorbent however the desorption ability of oh is limited because a fraction of phosphate species are strongly bonded onto mg al ldh through inner sphere complexation reaction morimoto et al 2012 except for the anion exchange mechanism the increase of naoh concentration results in the growth of solution ph changing the charge properties of ldh adsorbent and thus causing the release of surface adsorbed phosphate anions moreover it was found that the phosphorus desorbing ratio was in a strong linear relationship with naoh concentration r2 0 990 before the curve reaches a plateau the linear growth of p releasing amount with the hydroxide concentration suggests that ion exchange between oh ligands and phosphate species might be the major mechanism for p desorption from ldhs as summarized in table 1 shimamura et al 2012 shimamura et al 2013 reported that surfactants such as dodecylbenzenesulphonate also have high desorption capability for hydrogen phosphate intercalated ldh based on an anion exchange mechanism even achieving complete p extraction when desorption is performed twice however using surfactants as p extraction media may have two negative effects one is that the intercalated surfactant ions are strongly bonded to ldh cationic layers with low exchange capacity which reduces the reusability of ldhs the other is that the desorbed phosphorus in the surfactant solution is not as valuable as its aqueous form which can be recovered as fertilizer mg al ldh desorbed by naoh of different concentrations was characterized using the xrd technique and the results are presented in fig 4b with the increasing concentration of naoh the peaks representing the hydrotalcite phase became sharper with higher intensity which indicates the better crystallinity of the samples the magnesium phosphate hydrate phase icsd pdf 35 0330 was observed in the samples obtained from the desorption solutions of 0 001 m and 0 005 m naoh while mg al ldh was the unique crystalline phase in the other samples the precipitation of magnesium phosphate hydrate was caused by the dissolution of magnesium in a slightly alkaline solution and the simultaneous release of interlayer phosphate ions in addition there was a significant right shift of 0 0 3 peak in the samples desorbed by naoh at higher concentration revealing the decreasing value of d003 as shown in fig 4c as discussed in section 3 1 d003 is a direct reflection of the interlayer distance of ldhs and its reduction indicates that more oh ligands with small ionic radii were intercalated into the ldhs to replace phosphate species consistent with the p desorption efficiency curve fig 4a the reduction of d003 became moderate from the naoh concentration of 0 1 m at which naoh is close to its desorbing capacity fig 5 presents the sem images of mg al ldh obtained from different treatments fig 5a and b are morphology observations of uncalcined and calcined mg al ldh before adsorption similar to the tem observation shown in fig 1 calcination marginally increased the particle size and porosity of ldh adsorbent fig 5c and d displays the morphology of 0 1 m and 0 5 m naoh desorbed mg al ldh compared with the as prepared sample the appearance of naoh desorbed ldh was dramatically changed slice shaped precipitates covered the surface of the desorbed samples which were probably recrystallized products the recrystallization was enhanced in the desorption solution of 0 5 m naoh with reprecipitated particles at the size of 200 nm on average combined with the xrd results shown in fig 4b no new phases except for hydrotalcite were detected in naoh eluted samples naoh concentration 0 01 m which indicates that these slice precipitates were recrystallized ldh interlayered with hydroxide and phosphate species while the gradually increased intensity of diffraction patterns revealed a better crystallinity in the samples the dissolution reprecipitation d r mechanism proposed by hu and davies 1994 provides a good explanation of the phenomenon of the anion exchange reaction of ldhs according to the d r mechanism the anion exchange process of ldhs includes two basic steps i the dissolution of the host ldh phase at the solid liquid interface and ii the reprecipitation recrystallization of a new ldh product intercalated with desired anions or more stable phases this mechanism has been confirmed in series of studies by radha et al 2005 kooli et al 1997 serwicka et al 1997 and yun et al 1995 in particular in an anion exchange experiment performed by radha et al 2005 a new thermodynamically stable phase containing the same cations and anion as ldh was formed instead of the reconstruction of ldh 3 4 treatment by ammonia solution with struvite crystallization the recrystallization of mg al ldh in the desorption process by naoh not only causes the structural transformation of ldh reducing its p uptake ability but also limits its regeneration capability ammonia solution nh4oh is another commonly utilized alkaline eluant which is considered a mild oh supplier nh4oh solution at concentrations from 0 001 m to 0 5 m was used to desorb phosphorus from mg al ldh and the results are presented in fig s3 the low p desorption ratio 7 indicates that only a small fraction of p was extracted into the liquid phase while the major quantity of p was preserved in the solid phase characterizing the solid sample obtained from the ammonia solution by xrd technique a new crystalline phase was observed that can be identified as struvite as shown in the upper right corner in fig 6 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time the formation of struvite directly derived from the desorption process of mg al ldhs has been reported according to the d r mechanism the formation of struvite is due to the simultaneous release of magnesium cations and phosphate anions from p adsorbed mg al ldh into the ammonia solution and struvite is precipitated in preference to mg al oh or mg al po4 ldh due to its low solubility at ph of 10 11 ohlinger et al 1998 the struvite precipitates were also observed in the sem image of the corresponding sample desorbed by ammonia solution shown as the needle like particles emphasized by the red circle in fig 5e while other irregular particles were mg al ldh adsorbent elemental analysis via energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds shows that o mg and p are the three major detectable elements in the needle like particles fig 5f similar to the eds spectra of pure struvite reported by le corre et al 2007 to understand the effect of solid liquid ratio in ammonia treatment on p distribution in related media the achieved products from 0 5m nh4oh were quantitatively identified by the rietveld refinement technique providing the weight percentage information of the phases included a demonstration analysis solid liquid 1 g 0 25 l is shown in fig 6 hydrotalcite mg al ldh and struvite are the only two detectable phases in the solid samples using caf2 as the internal standard the weight percentages of the containing phases together with the amorphous content can be obtained on the basis of results from quantitative xrd analysis the p distribution in different media can be calculated by the following formula 6 r l c v m p 100 7 r s 12 64 w t p e r c e n t a g e o f s t r u v i t e m d m p 100 8 r a 100 r l r s where r l is the ratio of adsorbed p released into liquid solution c mg l is the measured concentration of p in the elution solution v l is the volume of the elution solution and m p mg is the p loading amount in adsorbent r s is the ratio of adsorbed p existing in the struvite phase and m d mg is the mass of dry solid obtained from the desorption solution r a is the ratio of adsorbed p retained in the ldh adsorbent or amorphous solid during the experiments there was a marginal change of the solid mass before and after desorption by nh4oh hence m d was valued by the solid dosage for desorption fig 7 summarizes the relative distribution of p in three forms r l r s r a at solid liquid ratios of 1 g 0 1 l 1 g 0 25 l 1 g 0 5 l 1 g 0 75 l and 1 g 1 l more p was released into the liquid phase as the solid liquid ratio decreased whereas the corresponding p concentration in solutions declined indicating that a higher solid liquid ratio achieved a better p accumulation effect the decreased phosphate concentration resulted in lower supersaturation and thus less struvite production as a whole the p amount reserved in ldh and or amorphous solid r a remained stable and accounted for the major part of totally adsorbed p ranging from wt 55 to wt 65 3 5 transfer of ammonia treated mg al ldh into a p slow releasing fertilizer the formation of struvite during desorption of p loaded mg al ldh in ammonia solution suggests that the resulting products might be transferred into a slow releasing fertilizer to compare the p leaching behavior of ammonia desorbed ldh de ldh and the pure struvite sample which has been well recognized as a slow releasing p fertilizer leaching experiments in deionized water were conducted the results are shown in fig 8 the kinetics of ion release from p adsorbed ldh without desorption ad ldh were also determined although all samples were washed by deionized water there was instantaneous ion release for three samples which can probably be attributed to the dissolution of surface ions due to the effect of shaking the p leaching behavior of de ldh is similar to that of struvite including the release amount and speed aside from the initial dissolution p was released from de ldh and struvite at an extremely slow speed ad ldh also discharged phosphorus species gently into deionized water in 96 h of contact time de ldh released 31 0 of containing p while ad ldh released 12 7 of adsorbed p which implies that ammonia treatment of mg al ldh probably weakened the interaction between phosphates and ldh cationic sheets thus resulting in more feasible p release the result suggests that phosphorus in de ldh is presumably more bioavailable than that in ad ldh though ad ldh has a higher p content than de ldh aluminum al discharge is also an important concern in the application of mg al ldh as fertilizer owing to the toxicity of high concentrations of aluminum for soil grown plants in particular the strong p retention capacity of al complexes significantly limits p availability in soil zhang et al 2001 kretzschmar et al 1991 the black points in fig 8 present the al leaching behavior of ad ldh and de ldh in deionized water both samples release trace amounts of al 1 9 mg g sample ammonia treated ldh immobilized al in structure more firmly than ad ldh the al releasing amount from desorbed ldh is around 0 3 mg g sample much lower than the p release quantity and should not greatly influence phosphorus availability in aquatic solutions xps analysis of three elements phosphorus aluminum and oxygen was conducted to further understand the surface chemical state of mg al ldh fig 9 a shows that there is a remarkable p 2p peak at 134 3 ev in the spectra of adsorbed ldh implying the successful loading of p onto ldh and the high signal intensity signifies high p uptake quantity in adsorbent the binding energy of p 2p in desorbed ldh is at 133 4 ev lower than the value of adsorbed ldh 134 3 ev which indicates that ammonia treatment not only desorbed phosphate anions from adsorbed ldh but also slightly changed the distribution of phosphate species in solid samples there was insignificant change of al 2p spectra of mg al ldh before and after phosphorus adsorption and before and after ammonia desorption suggesting that al remains stable in ldhs in the adsorption and desorption reaction process fig 9b the o 1s spectra in the adsorbent are mainly assigned to o2 oxygen bonded to metal and oh hydroxyl bonded to metal or o in phosphates zhou et al 2011 puziy et al 2008 there was a shift of o 1s peak from 531 3 ev in calcined ldh to 531 6 ev in ad ldh and de ldh as shown in fig 9c implying the slight change of oxygen constituents in the phosphorus uptake process both the leaching results and xps analysis demonstrate that ad ldh and de ldh release p at a slow rate in aqueous solutions and thus show great promise as a struvite like p fertilizer while the bioavailability of p in de ldh might be higher than that in ad ldh future studies should thus focus on testing the fertilizer properties of p loaded mg al ldh materials moreover how to design an effective ldh adsorption system to treat waste streams in continuous flow is another key issue for the further application of ldh adsorbent in p recovery there are two potential routes one is to maintain the fine powder form of ldh adsorbent with design of a dispersed air flotation system to solve the liquid solid separation problem and the other option is to prepare ldh adsorbent in granular particles which can be filled in a fixed bed filter no matter which route is selected pilot scale experiments are required to determine the design parameters of an adsorption system goh et al 2008 4 conclusions removing phosphorus from waste streams via adsorption and transforming the used adsorbents into a phosphorus fertilizer is an efficient route for phosphorus recovery in this study 300 c calcined mg al ldh nano composite was used as the phosphate adsorbent the material showed rapid phosphorus adsorbing ability and high saturation capacity for phosphorus adsorption based on kinetic and isotherm studies however it was found that the maximum phosphorus desorbing ratio from mg al ldh was 69 by 1m of naoh at the solid liquid ratio of 1 g 100 ml moreover xrd characterization and sem observation indicated that the ldh structure was significantly altered during the desorption process by naoh which can be attributed to the dissolution reprecipitation mechanism an ammonia solution was utilized to desorb p from mg al ldh which was observed with simultaneous crystallization of struvite as struvite has a higher precipitation tendency than mg al ldh because of the existence of nh4 ions comparison of leaching behavior among the p adsorbed ldh ammonia desorbed ldh and pure struvite suggests that ammonia treated ldh with co precipitation of struvite has great potential to serve as a struvite like phosphorus fertilizer exploring the transformation of p loaded adsorbents into a suitable p fertilizer will provide a new avenue for recovering phosphorus products from waste streams and also achieve the high

thresholds as well as achieving nutrient recycling mayer et al 2013 usepa 1998 blaney et al 2007 meanwhile phosphorus fertilizer production is highly dependent on mining of phosphorus rock which is a nonrenewable resource the looming p scarcity crisis is a major challenge for the global food supply childers et al 2011 rittmann et al 2011 because of the double pressure of the problems eutrophication and an unsustainable phosphorus supply techniques for p recovery from waste streams have been widely studied and developed in recent years mehta et al 2015 divided the nutrient recovery pathway into three processes nutrient accumulation nutrient release and nutrient extraction current established p recovery technologies focus on one or two of these processes there has been little integrative design that considers all of three for example struvite mgnh4po4 6h2o precipitation technology the most established of these technologies performs well in nutrient extraction because its precipitation product can be directly used as a high quality p slow releasing fertilizer comparable to commercial fertilizers rittmann et al 2011 johnston and richards 2003 le corre et al 2009 however struvite crystallization requires a relatively high p content 50 ppm p which is unsuitable for most waste streams in contrast adsorption technology is promising in its p accumulation ability but extracting p from used adsorbents and transferring it into valuable products remains challenging mehta et al 2015 donnert and salecker 1999 goh et al 2008 layered double hydroxides ldhs also known as hydrotalcite like compounds are a family of synthetic clay materials which have been reported to be promising anion adsorbents goh et al 2008 they are generally represented by the formula mii 1 xmiii x oh 2 x an x n yh2o where mii and miii are metal ions an is the interlayer anion and x is between 0 17 and 0 33 duan and evans 2006 kwon et al 1988 the crystal structure of ldhs is based on a brucite like layer structure in which a fraction of the divalent cations mii are replaced by trivalent cations miii resulting in positively charged octahedral sheets sato et al 1986 lagaly and beneke 1991 to neutralize positive charge the interlayer region is intercalated with exchangeable anions and water molecules which makes ldhs an efficient adsorbent material with high anion exchange capacity aec calcination was found to improve the adsorption performances of carbonate intercalating ldh adsorbent as carbonate ions with strong affinity to the metal layers were decomposed during thermal treatment and the reconstruction process known as the memory effect assisted the adsorption of anions onto ldhs goswamee et al 1998 lazaridis 2003 parker et al 1995 series of calcined ldhs demonstrated a high p uptake level in previous research kuzawa et al 2006 triantafyllidis et al 2010 cheng et al 2009 das et al 2006 calcined mg al ldh with mg al molar ratio at 2 was reported by das et al 2006 to be the most efficient phosphate adsorption material among commonly utilized ldhs particularly ultrathin mg al ldh nanosheets with calcination showed superior p eliminating ability toward low content phosphate solution attaining p removal ratio of 93 5 from 2 mg p l of phosphate solution zhan et al 2016 despite extensive attention paid to adsorption performance however there have been few studies of the desorption behavior of phosphate from ldhs and of recovering desorbed phosphorus as fertilizer which are actually the most challenging and costly parts of a complete nutrient recovery system goh et al 2008 kuzawa et al 2006 reported that the adsorption amount of p onto mg al ldh decreased to 70 of initial level after four running cycles using a solution of 3 w v naoh 10 w v nacl to perform the desorption and a solution of 25 w v mgcl2 to operate regeneration cheng et al 2009 also indicated that around 60 of zn al ldh was regenerated after six cycles of desorption with a solution of 5 wt naoh moreover a further increase in the concentration of sodium hydroxide may cause the dissolution of aluminum in an alkaline environment which significantly restricts the usable life of ldh adsorbents palmer et al 2009 radha et al 2005 given these issues torres dorante et al 2009 koilraj et al 2013 everaert et al 2016 proposed the novel idea of directly applying nutrient loaded ldh material as a slow releasing fertilizer on the basis of an evaluation of nutrient bioavailability in ldhs in this study p loaded mg al ldh was desorbed by ammonia solution resulting in the simultaneous formation of struvite the achieved solid mixture was confirmed to have similar p releasing properties to pure struvite precipitates in this way adsorption and struvite crystallization technologies were combined to realize effective p recovery from waste streams and obtain high quality outflow this study proposes in short an innovative p recovery route to use treated adsorbents which contain high nutrient content as agricultural fertilizer this route offers an alternative avenue for resource recycling from waste streams 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation of calcined mg al ldh nanocomposites carbonate intercalated mg al ldh was first prepared according to the co precipitation method described by chatelet et al 1996 a 500 ml solution containing 0 94 m na2co3 and 3 50 m naoh was added drop by drop into a vigorously stirred solution containing 1 m mg no3 2 6h2o and 0 5 m al no3 3 9h2o mg al at the molar ratio of 2 0 the resulting slurry was heated at 65 5 c and continuously stirred for 18 h followed by repeated centrifugation and washing with deionized di water it was then dried using a vacuum freezing drier the fine white powders obtained this way were thermally treated at 200 500 c for 10 h and finally the particles that passed through a 100 mesh screen were collected for the subsequent adsorption experiments 2 2 adsorption experiments all adsorption experiments described in this work were performed at room temperature of 25 1 c kh2po4 of chemical purity was dissolved in di water to prepare the p containing solution the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were studied in batch experiments with the same solid to liquid ratio at 2 g 1 l kinetic data were determined for two initial phosphorus concentrations 25 ppm p and 50 ppm p at a solution ph of 6 50 the supernatant was sampled at various time intervals up to 3 h reaction time phosphorus concentrations in the samples were measured by uv spectrophotometry at 700 nm using the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method the adsorption isotherm was studied for a wide range of initial p concentrations ranging from 10 ppm p to 1000 ppm p at ph 6 5 by adding 0 1 g adsorbents into a 50 ml solution shaken for 24 h to ensure the attainment of reaction equilibrium centrifugation and filtration were subsequently carried out and p in the supernatant was also measured by the molybdenum blue ascorbic acid method 2 3 desorption experiments for desorption studies 300 c calcined mg al ldh was dispersed in kh2po4 solution with p initial concentration at 500 ppm shaken for 24 h to prepare mg al ldh with high p uptake level the obtained adsorbent was filtered washed with di water and dried using the vacuum drying method the dry powder samples were subsequently distributed in naoh and ammonia solutions at various concentrations and allowed to react for 24 h to examine the desorption properties to achieve concentrated p solutions a high solid to liquid ratio 1 g 100 ml was applied in desorption experiments except that different solid to liquid ratios were tested for ammonia desorption solid and liquid samples were separated and collected for subsequent analysis in the same way as in the adsorption experiments 2 4 phosphorus release experiments to examine the possibility of using mg al ldh products as fertilizer leaching experiments with p loaded adsorbent nh3 h2o desorbed adsorbent and pure struvite samples were performed in di water the releasing kinetics of phosphate magnesium and aluminum ions were measured by dosing 0 1 g of solid powders into 10 ml of di water according to the described dosage of 1 w w in fertilizer testing chen et al 2006 the concentrations of magnesium and aluminum were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes perkin elmer optima 8000 2 5 characterization methods the diffraction data of selected solid samples were collected using powder x ray diffraction pxrd bruker d8 diffractometer equipped with a cupper x ray tube with a step size of 0 02 phase analysis was performed according to the standard powder diffraction database of the international centre for diffraction data icdd pdf 2 release 2008 additionally struvite weight percentage in precipitates was determined via the rietveld refinement method using topas 4 2 software bruker mannheim germany morphology observation of the adsorbent was conducted via scanning electron microscopy hitachi s 4800 feg and transmission electron microscopy fei tecnai g2 20 s twin tem x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis was carried out on a multifunctional imaging electron spectrometer thermo escalab 250xi with monochromatic al kα x ray radiation 3 results and discussion 3 1 the characterization of mg al ldh nanocomposites the representative morphology of as prepared mg al co3 ldh nanocomposite is shown in fig 1 a left the tem image reveals the nanoscale of synthesized ldh particles which were irregular in shape with an average size of around 50 nm combined with the sharp peaks in xrd patterns see fig 1a right the tem image also indicates that the prepared ldh sample was highly crystallized the xrd peaks were identified as the hydrotalcite phase according to the standard diffraction pattern of pdf 89 0460 taken from icsd inorganic crystal structure database the hkl s of the major peaks are indexed on the basis of space group r 3m no 166 among which the d spacing of peak 003 reflection d003 is a significant indicator for the interlayer distance of ldh crystal as the cell lattice parameter c 3d003 triantafyllidis et al 2010 cavani et al 1991 indicated that the intercalated carbonate ions in ldhs are linked to the hydroxyl groups of adjacent brucite like sheets directly or through h2o molecules by a hydrogen bridge in the forms of oh co3 ho or oh h2o co3 ho the flat distribution and the loose bonding to cationic layers mean that carbonate ions and h2o molecules can be eliminated from ldh without ruining the structure hence the calcined ldh material normally has the same or better adsorption properties compared with untreated ldh material due to the process of structural reconstruction in adsorption pre experiments see fig s1 in supporting information mg al ldh that was thermally treated at 300 c showed the best p removal performance and thus was used as the adsorbent in the subsequent experiments fig 1b left presents the tem image of the 300 c calcined ldh sample showing that the morphology of particles changed slightly after calcination and particles were linked with each other after thermal treatment the xrd pattern of calcined ldh as shown in fig 1b right was completely different from that of as prepared ldh the sharp peaks of the hydrotalcite phase disappeared indicating the collapse of the original crystal structure however several humps corresponding to the magnesium oxide phase icsd pdf 45 0946 appeared in the highly amorphous sample which shows that the brucite layer structure remained in the thermal treatment additionally no aluminum phases were observed in the calcined ldh which confirmed that al3 cations were uniformly distributed in the magnesium oxide matrix crepaldi et al 2002 3 2 sorption kinetics and isotherm an adsorption kinetic study of calcined mg al ldh in kh2po4 solutions with different p initial concentrations was carried out and the results are shown in fig 2 a the reactions almost reached equilibrium within 2 h for different phosphate loadings the reduction of initial p concentration of solutions caused a decrease in p adsorption amount onto ldh adsorbent and also affected the contact time to reach equilibrium thus the pseudo second order model is more suitable for describing p adsorption onto mg al ldh as the half life adsorption time for a first order kinetic reaction should remain constant regardless of the initial adsorbate concentration reddad et al 2002 additionally to identify the adsorption behavior of rehydrated ldh which might work based on a different adsorption mechanism from calcined ldh the kinetic data of rehydrated ldh were also collected before performing the adsorption experiment the 300 c calcined ldh was immersed in deionized water with shaking for adequate rehydration according to the xrd patterns in fig s2 the rehydrated ldh was completely restored to hydrotalcite crystalline structure with water molecules and or hydroxide ions intercalated between cationic sheets the final p adsorption amount of rehydrated ldh was lower than that of calcined ldh under the same experimental condition the different p loading in rehydrated and calcined ldh is likely due to the decreased surface adsorption and the lack of structure reconstruction of rehydrated ldh morimoto et al 2012 the kinetics data of calcined ldh were fitted by a pseudo second order kinetic model as shown in fig 2b the linear formula of the pseudo second order kinetic model is as follows 1 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where t is the reaction time min q t mg p g and q e mg p g are the adsorbed p quantity at time t and equilibrium and k 2 g mg 1 min 1 is the rate constant of the adsorption the calculated values of q e from the pseudo second order kinetic model were 12 45 mg g for 25 ppm solution and 24 21 mg g for 50 ppm solution which are quite close to experimental data besides the good linearity in fig 2b indicates the suitability of the pseudo second order model which is used to describe the chemisorption process involving ion exchange ho 2006 for the adsorption process in this study the fitting result suggests that ion exchange plays a major role in phosphate sorption onto calcined ldh the intraparticle diffusion was reported to be the rate limiting step within the ion exchange process halajnia et al 2013 fig 3 a and b presents the adsorption isotherms of phosphorus to calcined mg al ldh at room temperature fitted with langmuir and freundlich models the linear formulas of the langmuir and freundlich equations are presented in eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 2 c e q e 1 b q m c e q m 3 log q e log k f 1 n log c e where c e mg l is the p concentration at equilibrium q e mg g is the corresponding p adsorption amount q m mg g and b l mg are the langmuir constants indicating saturation capacity and adsorption affinity respectively and k f and n are the freundlich constants additionally there is a significant dimensionless constant r l calculated from langmuir constant b reflecting whether the adsorption is favorable foo and hameed 2010 weber and chakravorti 1974 4 r l 1 1 b c 0 where c 0 is the initial concentration of adsorbate solution the adsorption nature is unfavorable when r l 1 favorable when 0 r l 1 and irreversible when r l 0 both models exhibit an acceptable fit for the experimental data while the correlation coefficient r2 0 97 of the freundlich fit is marginally better than that of the langmuir fit r2 0 96 the langmuir constant b is calculated as 0 0097 l mg hence the r l value will be located in the range of 0 1 within a wide p initial concentration which suggests that the adsorption nature of phosphorus species onto calcined mg al ldh is favorable additionally the maximum adsorption capacity q m of calcined ldh achieved from langmuir fitting is around 100 7 mg p g which is quite high among the reported capacities of ldh type phosphorus sorbents according to the summary of wendling et al 2013 this result can presumably be attributed to the nanoscale size of the adsorbent and to the highly porous structure enhanced by freeze drying process on the basis of batch adsorption experiments calcined mg al ldh showed great potential for phosphorus extraction from waste streams 3 3 the desorption properties of p loaded mg al ldh though several studies have reported the adsorption behavior of p onto ldh type materials few studies have focused on the related desorption performance however desorption and regeneration are the most challenging and costly part of adsorption technology and may account for more than 70 of the total operation costs goh et al 2008 alkaline solutions salt solutions at high concentrations and their mixtures are commonly utilized to desorb p from ldh adsorbents table 1 summarizes desorption and regeneration performances of p from ldhs under various experimental conditions sodium hydroxide naoh solution was the most frequently utilized method for p desorption from ldhs in this study naoh solution at different concentrations ranging from 0 001 m to 1 0 m was applied in the elution experiment and the results are shown in fig 4 a the phosphorus desorption ratio was calculated by the following equation 5 p desorption ratio c v x 100 where c mg l is the p concentration in desorption solution v l is the volume of eluting solution and x mg is the adsorbed p amount mg in used ldh adsorbent the p desorption ratio grows continuously with the increase of naoh concentration and the speed of growth slows down when the concentration of naoh reaches 0 1 m the maximum p desorbing fraction is 69 with the concentration of naoh at 1 0 m this desorbing efficiency is lower than recorded in previous studies due to the high solid to liquid ratio according to he et al 2006 anions with higher charge density and smaller ionic radii have stronger affinity to brucite like sheets of ldhs and thus oh ions are in particularly strong interaction with the cationic layer of ldhs with a high concentration of naoh solution oh ions intercalate into the ldhs and substitute for phosphate anions to extract p from the adsorbent however the desorption ability of oh is limited because a fraction of phosphate species are strongly bonded onto mg al ldh through inner sphere complexation reaction morimoto et al 2012 except for the anion exchange mechanism the increase of naoh concentration results in the growth of solution ph changing the charge properties of ldh adsorbent and thus causing the release of surface adsorbed phosphate anions moreover it was found that the phosphorus desorbing ratio was in a strong linear relationship with naoh concentration r2 0 990 before the curve reaches a plateau the linear growth of p releasing amount with the hydroxide concentration suggests that ion exchange between oh ligands and phosphate species might be the major mechanism for p desorption from ldhs as summarized in table 1 shimamura et al 2012 shimamura et al 2013 reported that surfactants such as dodecylbenzenesulphonate also have high desorption capability for hydrogen phosphate intercalated ldh based on an anion exchange mechanism even achieving complete p extraction when desorption is performed twice however using surfactants as p extraction media may have two negative effects one is that the intercalated surfactant ions are strongly bonded to ldh cationic layers with low exchange capacity which reduces the reusability of ldhs the other is that the desorbed phosphorus in the surfactant solution is not as valuable as its aqueous form which can be recovered as fertilizer mg al ldh desorbed by naoh of different concentrations was characterized using the xrd technique and the results are presented in fig 4b with the increasing concentration of naoh the peaks representing the hydrotalcite phase became sharper with higher intensity which indicates the better crystallinity of the samples the magnesium phosphate hydrate phase icsd pdf 35 0330 was observed in the samples obtained from the desorption solutions of 0 001 m and 0 005 m naoh while mg al ldh was the unique crystalline phase in the other samples the precipitation of magnesium phosphate hydrate was caused by the dissolution of magnesium in a slightly alkaline solution and the simultaneous release of interlayer phosphate ions in addition there was a significant right shift of 0 0 3 peak in the samples desorbed by naoh at higher concentration revealing the decreasing value of d003 as shown in fig 4c as discussed in section 3 1 d003 is a direct reflection of the interlayer distance of ldhs and its reduction indicates that more oh ligands with small ionic radii were intercalated into the ldhs to replace phosphate species consistent with the p desorption efficiency curve fig 4a the reduction of d003 became moderate from the naoh concentration of 0 1 m at which naoh is close to its desorbing capacity fig 5 presents the sem images of mg al ldh obtained from different treatments fig 5a and b are morphology observations of uncalcined and calcined mg al ldh before adsorption similar to the tem observation shown in fig 1 calcination marginally increased the particle size and porosity of ldh adsorbent fig 5c and d displays the morphology of 0 1 m and 0 5 m naoh desorbed mg al ldh compared with the as prepared sample the appearance of naoh desorbed ldh was dramatically changed slice shaped precipitates covered the surface of the desorbed samples which were probably recrystallized products the recrystallization was enhanced in the desorption solution of 0 5 m naoh with reprecipitated particles at the size of 200 nm on average combined with the xrd results shown in fig 4b no new phases except for hydrotalcite were detected in naoh eluted samples naoh concentration 0 01 m which indicates that these slice precipitates were recrystallized ldh interlayered with hydroxide and phosphate species while the gradually increased intensity of diffraction patterns revealed a better crystallinity in the samples the dissolution reprecipitation d r mechanism proposed by hu and davies 1994 provides a good explanation of the phenomenon of the anion exchange reaction of ldhs according to the d r mechanism the anion exchange process of ldhs includes two basic steps i the dissolution of the host ldh phase at the solid liquid interface and ii the reprecipitation recrystallization of a new ldh product intercalated with desired anions or more stable phases this mechanism has been confirmed in series of studies by radha et al 2005 kooli et al 1997 serwicka et al 1997 and yun et al 1995 in particular in an anion exchange experiment performed by radha et al 2005 a new thermodynamically stable phase containing the same cations and anion as ldh was formed instead of the reconstruction of ldh 3 4 treatment by ammonia solution with struvite crystallization the recrystallization of mg al ldh in the desorption process by naoh not only causes the structural transformation of ldh reducing its p uptake ability but also limits its regeneration capability ammonia solution nh4oh is another commonly utilized alkaline eluant which is considered a mild oh supplier nh4oh solution at concentrations from 0 001 m to 0 5 m was used to desorb phosphorus from mg al ldh and the results are presented in fig s3 the low p desorption ratio 7 indicates that only a small fraction of p was extracted into the liquid phase while the major quantity of p was preserved in the solid phase characterizing the solid sample obtained from the ammonia solution by xrd technique a new crystalline phase was observed that can be identified as struvite as shown in the upper right corner in fig 6 to the best of our knowledge this is the first time the formation of struvite directly derived from the desorption process of mg al ldhs has been reported according to the d r mechanism the formation of struvite is due to the simultaneous release of magnesium cations and phosphate anions from p adsorbed mg al ldh into the ammonia solution and struvite is precipitated in preference to mg al oh or mg al po4 ldh due to its low solubility at ph of 10 11 ohlinger et al 1998 the struvite precipitates were also observed in the sem image of the corresponding sample desorbed by ammonia solution shown as the needle like particles emphasized by the red circle in fig 5e while other irregular particles were mg al ldh adsorbent elemental analysis via energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds shows that o mg and p are the three major detectable elements in the needle like particles fig 5f similar to the eds spectra of pure struvite reported by le corre et al 2007 to understand the effect of solid liquid ratio in ammonia treatment on p distribution in related media the achieved products from 0 5m nh4oh were quantitatively identified by the rietveld refinement technique providing the weight percentage information of the phases included a demonstration analysis solid liquid 1 g 0 25 l is shown in fig 6 hydrotalcite mg al ldh and struvite are the only two detectable phases in the solid samples using caf2 as the internal standard the weight percentages of the containing phases together with the amorphous content can be obtained on the basis of results from quantitative xrd analysis the p distribution in different media can be calculated by the following formula 6 r l c v m p 100 7 r s 12 64 w t p e r c e n t a g e o f s t r u v i t e m d m p 100 8 r a 100 r l r s where r l is the ratio of adsorbed p released into liquid solution c mg l is the measured concentration of p in the elution solution v l is the volume of the elution solution and m p mg is the p loading amount in adsorbent r s is the ratio of adsorbed p existing in the struvite phase and m d mg is the mass of dry solid obtained from the desorption solution r a is the ratio of adsorbed p retained in the ldh adsorbent or amorphous solid during the experiments there was a marginal change of the solid mass before and after desorption by nh4oh hence m d was valued by the solid dosage for desorption fig 7 summarizes the relative distribution of p in three forms r l r s r a at solid liquid ratios of 1 g 0 1 l 1 g 0 25 l 1 g 0 5 l 1 g 0 75 l and 1 g 1 l more p was released into the liquid phase as the solid liquid ratio decreased whereas the corresponding p concentration in solutions declined indicating that a higher solid liquid ratio achieved a better p accumulation effect the decreased phosphate concentration resulted in lower supersaturation and thus less struvite production as a whole the p amount reserved in ldh and or amorphous solid r a remained stable and accounted for the major part of totally adsorbed p ranging from wt 55 to wt 65 3 5 transfer of ammonia treated mg al ldh into a p slow releasing fertilizer the formation of struvite during desorption of p loaded mg al ldh in ammonia solution suggests that the resulting products might be transferred into a slow releasing fertilizer to compare the p leaching behavior of ammonia desorbed ldh de ldh and the pure struvite sample which has been well recognized as a slow releasing p fertilizer leaching experiments in deionized water were conducted the results are shown in fig 8 the kinetics of ion release from p adsorbed ldh without desorption ad ldh were also determined although all samples were washed by deionized water there was instantaneous ion release for three samples which can probably be attributed to the dissolution of surface ions due to the effect of shaking the p leaching behavior of de ldh is similar to that of struvite including the release amount and speed aside from the initial dissolution p was released from de ldh and struvite at an extremely slow speed ad ldh also discharged phosphorus species gently into deionized water in 96 h of contact time de ldh released 31 0 of containing p while ad ldh released 12 7 of adsorbed p which implies that ammonia treatment of mg al ldh probably weakened the interaction between phosphates and ldh cationic sheets thus resulting in more feasible p release the result suggests that phosphorus in de ldh is presumably more bioavailable than that in ad ldh though ad ldh has a higher p content than de ldh aluminum al discharge is also an important concern in the application of mg al ldh as fertilizer owing to the toxicity of high concentrations of aluminum for soil grown plants in particular the strong p retention capacity of al complexes significantly limits p availability in soil zhang et al 2001 kretzschmar et al 1991 the black points in fig 8 present the al leaching behavior of ad ldh and de ldh in deionized water both samples release trace amounts of al 1 9 mg g sample ammonia treated ldh immobilized al in structure more firmly than ad ldh the al releasing amount from desorbed ldh is around 0 3 mg g sample much lower than the p release quantity and should not greatly influence phosphorus availability in aquatic solutions xps analysis of three elements phosphorus aluminum and oxygen was conducted to further understand the surface chemical state of mg al ldh fig 9 a shows that there is a remarkable p 2p peak at 134 3 ev in the spectra of adsorbed ldh implying the successful loading of p onto ldh and the high signal intensity signifies high p uptake quantity in adsorbent the binding energy of p 2p in desorbed ldh is at 133 4 ev lower than the value of adsorbed ldh 134 3 ev which indicates that ammonia treatment not only desorbed phosphate anions from adsorbed ldh but also slightly changed the distribution of phosphate species in solid samples there was insignificant change of al 2p spectra of mg al ldh before and after phosphorus adsorption and before and after ammonia desorption suggesting that al remains stable in ldhs in the adsorption and desorption reaction process fig 9b the o 1s spectra in the adsorbent are mainly assigned to o2 oxygen bonded to metal and oh hydroxyl bonded to metal or o in phosphates zhou et al 2011 puziy et al 2008 there was a shift of o 1s peak from 531 3 ev in calcined ldh to 531 6 ev in ad ldh and de ldh as shown in fig 9c implying the slight change of oxygen constituents in the phosphorus uptake process both the leaching results and xps analysis demonstrate that ad ldh and de ldh release p at a slow rate in aqueous solutions and thus show great promise as a struvite like p fertilizer while the bioavailability of p in de ldh might be higher than that in ad ldh future studies should thus focus on testing the fertilizer properties of p loaded mg al ldh materials moreover how to design an effective ldh adsorption system to treat waste streams in continuous flow is another key issue for the further application of ldh adsorbent in p recovery there are two potential routes one is to maintain the fine powder form of ldh adsorbent with design of a dispersed air flotation system to solve the liquid solid separation problem and the other option is to prepare ldh adsorbent in granular particles which can be filled in a fixed bed filter no matter which route is selected pilot scale experiments are required to determine the design parameters of an adsorption system goh et al 2008 4 conclusions removing phosphorus from waste streams via adsorption and transforming the used adsorbents into a phosphorus fertilizer is an efficient route for phosphorus recovery in this study 300 c calcined mg al ldh nano composite was used as the phosphate adsorbent the material showed rapid phosphorus adsorbing ability and high saturation capacity for phosphorus adsorption based on kinetic and isotherm studies however it was found that the maximum phosphorus desorbing ratio from mg al ldh was 69 by 1m of naoh at the solid liquid ratio of 1 g 100 ml moreover xrd characterization and sem observation indicated that the ldh structure was significantly altered during the desorption process by naoh which can be attributed to the dissolution reprecipitation mechanism an ammonia solution was utilized to desorb p from mg al ldh which was observed with simultaneous crystallization of struvite as struvite has a higher precipitation tendency than mg al ldh because of the existence of nh4 ions comparison of leaching behavior among the p adsorbed ldh ammonia desorbed ldh and pure struvite suggests that ammonia treated ldh with co precipitation of struvite has great potential to serve as a struvite like phosphorus fertilizer exploring the transformation of p loaded adsorbents into a suitable p fertilizer will provide a new avenue for recovering phosphorus products from waste streams and also achieve the high

19341,one challenge in h2o2 based fenton like reaction is to break through the limitation of slow reduction of ferric species feiii present work describes a dramatic acceleration of fenton like reaction at neutral ph by using calcium peroxide cao2 as a source of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and edta as a chelating agent of ferric ions in an optimized condition phenol degradation in the h2o2 system displayed an initial latent time of 60 min while phenol can be degraded immediately and removed completely in 30 min in the cao2 system visual minteq analyses indicated fe edta was the active species in the reaction the contribution of 1o2 in cao2 system was excluded by the poor selectivity in phenol conversion and the comparable 1o2 temp epr signals in both cao2 and h2o2 systems kinetic analyses using chloroform as the probe of o2 suggested the high production rate of o2 which is four orders of magnitude higher than that in h2o2 system the mechanism of the accelerated cao2 based fenton like reactions was featured by that two electrons coming from cao2 can be utilized to promote reduction of feiii an inner sphere electron transfer takes place to reduce feiii edta and produce o2 and subsequently o2 provides an electron to reduce another feiii edta the revealed intrinsic reducibility in cao2 based fenton like reaction represents a new strategy to break through the well known rate limiting step of feiii reduction in fenton like reaction and facilitate the removal of organic pollutants at neutral phs and also indicates a promising source of o2 for diverse applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords fenton like reaction calcium peroxide hydrogen peroxide superoxide radicals 1 introduction in order to remove recalcitrant organic contaminants in wastewater various types of

1 li et al 2016 lin and gurol 1998 one strategy to overcome the limitation is to use chelating agents such as ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 citric acid vicente et al 2011 and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta he et al 2015 kwon et al 2009 xia et al 2018 these chelating agents were used to complex iron to prevent its precipitation and change the redox properties of metal to make the reaction r2 thermodynamically feasible bienfait 1988 engelmann et al 2003 because of its ability to complex strongly with iron ions values of log k are 24 23 and 14 33 for ferrous or ferric ions respectively speight 2005 edta has been frequently applied in fenton like reactions to facilitate the degradation of organic pollutants at neutral phs the mechanism of fenton like reaction for h2o2 activation by feiii edta complexes can be described based on the classical haber weiss reaction kwon et al 2009 li et al 2016 lin and gurol 1998 feiii edta is reduced by h2o2 to produce feii edta r3 followed by oxidation of feii edta with h2o2 to continue the cycle r2 however since the reduction of feiii edta by h2o2 is very slow 0 002 0 01 m 1s 1 the cycle of feiii feii has been regarded as the rate determining step in both heterogeneous and homogeneous fenton like reactions pham et al 2009 accelerating the reduction of ferric species feiii is one of the most crucial challenges in fenton like aops several approaches were developed to break through the limitation on the slow reduction step the addition of reductive substance like ascorbic acid huang et al 2017 protocatechuic acid qin et al 2015 and hydroxylamine chen et al 2011 hou et al 2017 can facilitate the reduction of feiii in the solution or on the surface of solid catalysts the reductive intermediates produced in phenol degradation was found to significantly enhance phenol degradation due to the promoted reduction of feiii resulting in a self catalytic kinetics in degradation of phenolic compounds chen and pignatello 1997 du et al 2006 jin et al 2017 recently metal sulfides were employed as co catalysts to accelerate the cycle of feiii feii by forming reductive metallic active sites xing et al 2018 ultra dispersed fe3o4 nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide rgo nanosheets were prepared to improve the conversion efficiency of feiii feii by concentrating electrons on rgo surface qiu et al 2016 furthermore photo fenton like reaction can enhance the cycle of feiii feii by photoreduction of ferric complexes cieśla et al 2004 zou et al 2018 however the addition of reductive substance or external energy input would either compete with target organic pollutants for reactive oxygen species ros and decrease the utilization efficiency of h2o2 or increase the operation cost therefore it is great demanding to develop a novel cost efficient strategy to promote the cycle of feiii feii in fact the reduction of feiii by o2 is very fast r4 while only a few studies like the complex of feiii edds huang et al 2013 and mn2 mediation li et al 2016 reported the facilitated reduction of feiii in fenton like reaction by highlighting the o2 pathway nevertheless development of mechanistic strategies to increase the production of o2 at the initial reactions could be an effective way to promote fenton like reaction and facilitate its applications in

zhou et al 2017 reactions r5 and r6 describe the decomposition of cao2 in water which depends much on ph and temperature the release of h2o2 can take place over a wide ph range 6 12 bogan et al 2003 and the rate of h2o2 generation can be regulated by adjusting ph in fact cao2 has been widely investigated for decades in remediation of contaminated soil ndjou ou and cassidy 2006 xu et al 2011 and groundwater mosmeri et al 2017 qian et al 2015 due to its versatility and environmental friendliness thani et al 2016 although many of studies and applications of cao2 in fenton like reaction have been done the basic understanding on the intrinsic difference between cao2 and h2o2 based fenton like reaction should be improved in this study series of batch experiments on phenol degradation in cao2 feiii edta and h2o2 feiii edta fenton like reactions at neutral ph were conducted the notable differences between the two systems were understood by ros identification intermediate track electrochemical and kinetic analyses and the endogenetic reducibility of cao2 to facilitate fenton like reaction was finally revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were analytical grade without further purification cao2 75 0 was purchased from shanghai titan chemical reagent co ltd whose density and particle sizes are in the range of 500 650 g l and 75 150

ph four batch tests were conducted cao2 alone cao2 and edta cao2 and feiii cao2 and feiii edta the tests were conducted at 30 c by using 1 g l cao2 0 7 mm fe no3 3 n edta n fe 1 7 and 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 the maximum theoretical concentration of h2o2 released from 1 g l cao2 is 13 9 mm samples were withdrawn at the predetermined time and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter for h2o2 measurements 2 3 organic degradation tests phenol solution 0 80 mm was prepared in a phosphate buffer 50 mm most phs of solutions were maintained at 7 0 except the tests on the effect of phs preliminary tests fig s2 indicated that 50 mm phosphate displayed slight inhibition on phenol degradation but can maintain ph variation in 0 2 units in the presence of 1 g l cao2 phenol degradation was conducted to investigate the performance of heterogeneous cao2 feiii edta and homogeneous h2o2 feiii edta systems the reaction was carried out in a conical flask with a magnetic stirrer under a speed of 500 rpm at 30 c in a typical experiment 1 4 mm fe no3 3 and edta was added into a 50 ml buffered phenol solution then 1 g l cao2 or 13 9 mm h2o2 was added to initiate the reaction samples were withdrawn at predetermined intervals quenched immediately by methanol and then analyzed by hplc three more aromatic compounds o dhb ba and 4 cp were used to explore the oxidation performance of the two fenton like reaction systems 2 4 analytic methods the concentration of h2o2 in aqueous phase was measured according to a metavanadate method ling et al 2014 nogueira et al 2005 briefly samples were withdrawn and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter 1 ml sample and 1 ml ammonium metavanadate 62 mm were injected into a colorimetric tube diluting to 10 ml with deionized water solutions were detected by a uv vis spectrophotometer wfj 7200 unic at 450 nm after developing color quantitative analyses of the residual organics and intermediates were performed using a hplc shimadzu lc 20ad equipped with a shim pack c18 chromatographic column zorbax eclipse xdb c18 and an uv vis detector spd 20av detailed hplc analytical conditions including mobile phase flow rate and the detection wavelength are listed in table s1 all experiments were conducted in triplicate epr measurements were used to detect the existence of oh and 1o2 the sweep width were set to 100 g and 115 4 g for the spin traps of dmpo and temp respectively microwave power and microwave frequency were set at 15 mw and 9 85 ghz in the tests the electrochemical measurements were detected with a computer controlled chi 760 electrochemical workstation in cyclic voltammetry cv measurements a standard three electrode configuration including a glassy carbon electrode as a working electrode an ag agcl electrode as a reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode was used to track the open circuit potential of pt electrode another pt electrode and a saturated calomel electrode were applied as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 release of h2o2 and phenol degradation the release of h2o2 from 1 g l cao2 slurry in phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 0 was recorded fig 1 a the h2o2 concentration after the immediate addition of cao2 was 4 01 mm and then reached an equilibrium concentration in 1 h which was 10 3 mm about 75 of the theoretical value for the completely conversion of cao2 the presence of edta or feiii had negligible influence on the release of h2o2 the slightly reduction of h2o2 beginning from 4 h could be due to the catalyzed decomposition of h2o2 by the few dissolved ferric species however the concentration of h2o2 decreased in the presence of feiii edta complex the initial h2o2 concentration was 3 43 mm indicating the interaction between cao2 and feiii edta the maximum generation of h2o2 was 9 3 mm at 1 h then continuously decreased to 7 8 mm at 24 h this could be due to the consumption of h2o2 by feiii edta or intermediates a comparison of phenol degradation in different fenton like systems at neutral ph ph 7 0 is shown in fig 1b using h2o2 13 9 mm as the oxidant and feiii edta as the catalyst the initial phenol degradation was very slow only achieving 12 1 reduction in the first 2 h however phenol degradation was significantly accelerated after 2 h and 89 4 phenol reduction was obtained after 8 h reaction this initial period before a sudden increase in the reaction rate was named as latent time luo et al 2009 such a self catalysis phenomenon in phenol degradation through fenton or fenton like reactions has been attributed to the generation of reductive intermediates like p hq or o dhb which possesses the ability to accelerate the cycle of feiii feii du et al 2006 jin et al 2017 when using cao2 1 g l equivalent of 13 9 mm h2o2 instead of h2o2 phenol degradation started as soon as the addition of the oxidant fig 1b there was no latent time in the cao2 based system without iron species in the cao2 suspension there was negligible phenol reduction after 24 h suggesting that the oxidation power of cao2 is not strong enough to directly oxidize phenol the time dependent h2o2 concentrations during phenol degradation in the oxidation systems of fig 1b were presented in fig 1c it is obviously that few h2o2 consumed in the absence of feiii edta resulting in negligible removal of phenol the largest reductions of h2o2 concentrations occurred at 0 5 1 5 h and 2 4 h in cao2 feiii edta and h2o2 feiii edta systems respectively utilization efficiency of h2o2 was defined as the amount of hydrogen peroxide decomposed leading to per unit molar of phenol conversion the utilization efficiencies in the significant phenol removal periods in the two systems were compared results showed that in cao2 feiii edta system 0 5 1 5 h the value was 3 47 mol h2o2 mol phenol better than that in h2o2 feiii edta system 2 4 h 4 31 mol h2o2 mol phenol therefore above comparisons indicated that the fenton like reactions using cao2 and h2o2 as oxidants have essential differences 3 2 effects of reaction parameters the effect of reaction parameters on phenol degradation was investigated in a buffered cao2 system fig 2 and compared with those in the h2o2 system fig s3 cao2 fig 2a and iron dosages fig 2b were optimized as 1 g l and 1 4 mm respectively phenol degradation rate increasing with more cao2 dosage was due to the production of more h2o2 however excess cao2 would increase the slurry s ph because the buffer 50 mm phosphate capacity was not strong enough to maintain the ph at such high dosages although increasing the iron dosage accelerated phenol degradation fig 2b the difference on the degradation rates for 1 4 and 2 1 mm iron species was negligible it could be attributed to the balance between the iron species and the released h2o2 when the iron dosage was above 1 4 mm in the absence of edta phenol degradation is negligible due to the precipitation of ferric irons the addition of edta significantly improved phenol degradation fig 2c with an increase in molecular ratio of edta to fe from 1 7 to 1 2 phenol removal in 30 min increased from 27 to 100 in the range from 1 2 to 2 1 the difference in phenol degradation was negligible this was because excess organic chelates like edta could compete with phenol for ros zhou et al 2017 however in the h2o2 system fig s3a phenol started degradation at about 60 min for all ratios of edta to fe and the optimal ratio was 1 1 which is the theoretical ratio in feiii edta complex francis et al 1985 rush and koppenol 1988 this indicated that latent time in h2o2 system could not be altered by enhancing the ratio of edta to fe since phenol degradation efficiencies when the ratio of edta to fe at 1 2 and 1 1 were close the ratio of edta to fe was set as 1 2 for further tests the effects of ph on phenol degradation in both systems are shown in fig 2d and fig s3b the cao2 system worked well in the ph range of 3 7 and phenol removal efficiency after 60 min can reach 100 at all of these phs however the reaction was notably inhibited when ph was above 7 0 in the h2o2 system the favorable ph range was narrow and obvious phenol degradation can only be achieved in the ph range of 6 7 fig s3b both acidic and basic conditions inhibited h2o2 activation and phenol degradation the poor activity at basic conditions could either be attributed to the tendency of cao2 to decompose into o2 instead of h2o2 wang et al 2016 or be ascribed to the presence of less active species at high phs nevertheless the poor activity at acidic ph in the h2o2 system can be attributed to the strong inhibited regeneration of feii edta due to the formation of perhydroxyl radical ooh of which the rate constant for the reduction of feiii is around 3 4 orders of magnitude less than that of o2 li et al 2016 the satisfactory activity of cao2 at acidic phs indicated that there was a pathway for the cycle of feiii feii which has not been limited by ooh iron species in the buffered feiii edta solution were simulated and analyzed by a chemical speciation model visual minteq software version 3 1 to understand the influence of ph and the ratio of edta to fe when the ratio of edta to fe increased fig 3 a the percentages of complexed iron species including feedta feohedta2 and fe2 oh 2edta2 4 increased accompanied with the increase of phenol degradation rates fig 2c however in the ph range of 3 7 that phenol can be efficiently degraded the amounts of feohedta2 and fe2 oh 2edta2 4 were negligible fig 3b at high phs and low dosages of edta other soluble iron species like fe oh 2 fe oh 4 fehpo4 became predominate resulting in a very low phenol removal efficiency this indicates that their contribution to h2o2 activation was negligible moreover a linearity relationship was found between the percentages of feedta and phenol degradation rate constants at different ratios of edta to fe fig s4 suggesting that feedta was the most important active species in h2o2 activation in this fenton like system furthermore activation of h2o2 by metal chelates can be estimated by the chemical reaction potential of r2 0 46 e m at ph 7 e m is the redox potential of f e ii l f e iii l couple the redox potential of the couple feiii edta feii edta was measured as 0 14 v vs nhe in the presence of phosphate fig s5 which was close to the reported value 0 13 v vs nhe bienfait 1988 but much lower than fe3 fe2 couple 0 77 v vs nhe indicating the h2o2 activation reaction was thermodynamically favorable due to the reaction potential of r2 become positive 0 32 v vs nhe better initial performance for phenol degradation detected in the cao2 based fenton like system was also applicable for other aromatic compounds fig s6 the removal efficiencies in h2o2 system for 4 cp and ba in the first 30 min were only 8 6 and 10 respectively subsequently both organics can be degraded in 180 min this suggested an initial latent time and self catalysis mechanism in degradation of both compounds the initial degradation of 4 cp and ba in cao2 system was obviously faster than that in the h2o2 system nevertheless degradation of o dhb a well known reductive intermediate in phenol degradation are comparable in both systems 75 mg l o dhb was completely degraded within 30 min the absence of initial latent time for o dhb can be understood by the accelerated generation of ferrous species in the presence of reductive o dhb jin et al 2017 rodriguez et al 2001 the results suggested that using cao2 as an oxidant can significantly accelerate the initial degradation of various aromatic compounds in fenton like reactions experiments on the effect of cao2 additions in the h2o2 systems fig s7 were conducted in the tests the total theoretical molar amount of h2o2 was 13 9 mm and the molar percentage of cao2 were 100 50 33 25 20 and 0 the results suggested that cao2 addition accelerated the initial phenol degradation the phenol degradation rate increased with more cao2 addition it further proved the favorable effect of cao2 in fenton like reactions 3 3 mechanism on cao2 based fenton like reaction in order to explore the reasons for phenol degradation improvement in the heterogeneous cao2 based fenton like reaction several control tests including using ca oh 2 quartz sand and aged cao2 were carried out as shown in fig 4 a compared with the homogeneous h2o2 feiii edta system the addition of quartz sand did not show any favorable effect while ca oh 2 obviously shortened the latent time for phenol degradation to 30 min ca oh 2 is the final product of cao2 decomposition in water r5 and r6 this indicated that the promoted initial phenol degradation depended much on the characteristic of solid species the favorable effect of ca oh 2 could be attributed to the conversion tendency of ca oh 2 and h2o2 toward cao2 qian et al 2013 furthermore instead of using fresh cao2 to initiate degradation the aged cao2 the same dosage of cao2 stirred for 2 h in phosphate buffer was used and feiii edta solution and phenol was subsequently added to start fenton like reaction it can be expected that the main species in the aged cao2 suspension are freshly produced ca oh 2 and h2o2 in this case the initial phenol degradation was slightly slower than the fresh cao2 system but much faster than the ca oh 2 and h2o2 system the oxidation performance of fresh cao2 system was optimal the changes in the pt electrode potential in the initial fenton like reaction were measured to evaluate the initial reduction of feiii edta in the tests edta and ferric ions were added into a buffered ph 7 phenol solution and the mixture were stirred for 10 min and then the oxidant 13 9 mm h2o2 or 1 g l cao2 was injected into the solution to initiate the reaction as shown in fig 4b the pt electrode potential decreased immediately after the addition of oxidants and reached balance at 1600 s which was a combination result of reductive substance including the added h2o2 and the in situ generated feii edta chen et al 2002 however the decreased potential of cao2 system was obviously higher than that of h2o2 system at the initial time and the difference was as much as 49 6 mv at the balance time this indicated that much more reductive substance was present in the cao2 system considering the maximum released h2o2 concentration in the cao2 suspension was 25 less than that in h2o2 system and simultaneously there was significant consumption of h2o2 due to immediate phenol degradation such a decreased potential in cao2 suspension was an indication of significantly higher contents of reductive substance furthermore in the presence of ca oh 2 in the h2o2 system the decreased potential at the balance time was 10 2 mv higher than that in the absence of ca oh 2 it further verified the favorable effect of both cao2 and ca oh 2 in accelerating the reduction of feiii edta to explore the reasons for the promoted reduction of feiii edta to feii edta the main ros for phenol degradation were investigated by scavenger tests and epr spectra measurements methanol chloroform and l histidine were used as the respective scavenger of oh o2 and 1o2 k m e t h a n o l o h 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k chloroform o 2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 k l h i s t i d i n e 1 o 2 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 davies 2003 wang et al 2017 wilkinson et al 1995 in both systems methanol strongly inhibited phenol degradation indicating the predominate role of oh in phenol degradation fig 5 a and b the existence of oh in cao2 system was also proved by epr spectrum fig 5c as the four peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were the indication of the spin adduct dmpo oh although there is controversy on the main active species high valent iron or oh in fenton like reactions at the neutral ph rush and koppenol 1988 yamazaki and piette 1991 our results suggested the significant contribution of oh in the reactions chloroform displayed inhibitory effect on phenol degradation in the cao2 system but slightly accelerated phenol degradation in the h2o2 system the slightly accelerated phenol degradation in the latter one could be attributed to the formation of other reactive radicals rodriguez chueca et al 2016 the result of feiii edta was different from the previous report that using fe iii edds as the catalyst for h2o2 activation in which o2 was produced to facilitate bisphenol a degradation huang et al 2013 it indicated that fe iii edta alone was not a source of aqueous electrons or o2 in the fenton like reaction the inhibitory effect of chloroform in cao2 system indicated that o2 showed important contribution for phenol degradation although epr spectrum can be applied for o2 detection zheng et al 2017 2018 the signals were indiscernible in the methanol suspension with cao2 and feiii edta xue et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 amina et al 2018 this could be attributed to the different decomposition behavior of cao2 in methanol l histidine the frequently employed scavenger of 1o2 obviously suppressed degradation of phenol in both systems the occurrence of 1o2 was further proved by epr spectra using temp as the spin trap as shown in fig 5d the typical peaks of the spin adduct temp 1o2 exhibiting three peaks at the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 were observed in both h2o2 and cao2 systems duan et al 2018 he et al 2014 it is known that 1o2 can be produced by o2 r7 and through a disproportionation reaction of h2o2 that catalyzed by ca ii in the cao2 system as described by r8 in which the precursor was regarded as cao2 2h2o2 nardello et al 1998 li et al 2018 however the reaction rate constant between l histidine and oh is also high 5 109 m 1 s 1 the inhibition from l histidine cannot be exclusively attributed to the 1o2 r7 2 o 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 2 o h 1 o 2 r8 2 h 2 o 2 c a i i 2 h 2 o α 1 o 2 1 α 3 o 2 the produced 1o2 can react with phenol and produce reductive bisphenol or quinone intermediates through a non radical pathway and subsequently promotes the reduction of feiii edta and enhances the generation of oh the intermediates of p hq and o dhb in both systems were tracked fig 6 a in cao2 system o dhb and p hq were generated immediately after the addition of the oxidant and their concentrations continuously increased to a maximum yield of 32 8 mg l at 20 min and 20 5 mg l at 15 min respectively after 1 h most of the intermediates converted into small molecular acid co2 and h2o liu et al 2018 it was reported that the reaction between phenol and 1o2 should form selectively hydroxylated products at the para position that is p hq scheme s1 briviba et al 1993 however o dhb and p hq were simultaneously produced and their concentrations were comparable indicating the poor selectivity toward p hq in the oxidation of phenol in cao2 system furthermore no reductive intermediate can be detected at the first 45 min in the h2o2 system although comparable 1o2 can be measured fig 5d this can be understood by the reaction rate constants of water and phenol with 1o2 water owns a high first order rate constant with 1o2 k water 2 5 105 s 1 resulting in that its reaction rate was over 300 times higher than phenol at its present concentrations k phenol 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 therefore the occurrence of 1o2 had very low opportunity to react with phenol however the favorable role of 1o2 could be much improved in degradation of ffa which has a high rate constant with 1o2 k ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 about two orders of magnitude higher than that of phenol wilkinson et al 1995 as shown in fig 6b the degradation rate of ffa was dramatically higher than that of phenol in h2o2 system and the latent time disappeared however in cao2 system the difference between phenol and ffa degradation became smaller this is also an evidence to against the important contribution of 1o2 in the cao2 system meanwhile results in fig 6b suggest that cao2 is superior to h2o2 in fenton like degradation of both phenol and ffa r9 o h h 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 h k 1 2 4 5 10 7 li et al 2016 walling 1975 r10 o h o 2 h 2 o o 2 k 8 9 10 9 kwan and voelker 2002 the enhanced phenol degradation in the cao2 system can also be caused by the enhanced generation of o2 because of the high reaction rate constant between o2 and feiii 107 108 m 1s 1 r4 according to the chemiluminescence and uv vis spectra ma et al proved the presence of oh and o2 on the surface of cao2 in contact with water and assumed the reaction r9 to suggest that o2 was originated from oh and h2o2 in cao2 suspension ma et al 2007 however it can be expected that the concentration of oh is very low and o2 could also be quickly consumed by oh r10 whose reaction rate constant is at least one order of magnitude faster than that with feiii edta ma et al 2007 moreover change of phenol concentration in the cao2 system was unobservable in the absence of feiii edta indicating feiii edta was indispensable for generation of considerable ros oh or o2 kinetic analyses were further carried out based on the effect of chloroform dosages on phenol degradation in the cao2 system as shown in fig 7 a phenol degradation was strongly inhibited in the presence of chloroform and the inhibitory strengthened with the increase of chloroform concentrations latent time for phenol degradation became notable in the presence of 40 mm chloroform fig 7b shows the relationship between initial degradation rates of phenol r p h e n o l d m s 1 and chloroform dosages according to a steady state approximation of o2 r p h e n o l d can be calculated according to

is the formation rate of o2 and k p h e n o l o 2 2 107 m 1 s 1 k c h l o r o f o r m o 2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 and k f e iii e d t a o 2 107 108 m 1s 1 were second order rate constants of superoxide radical with phenol chloroform and f e iii e d t a respectively buxton et al 1988 there were other unclear o2 involved reactions that can be represented by α the hyperbolic curve in fig 7b was fitted with the equation of y 1 ax b and a represents for k c h l o r o f o r m o 2 r o 2 f k p h e n o l o 2 p h e n o l then r o 2 f can be obtained as 4 5 10 3 m s 1 according to eq 2 however in h2o2 system according to the concentrations of h2o2 13 9 mm and iron 1 4 mm and the k value 0 01 m 1s 1 of reaction r3 the formation rate of o2 was only 1 9 10 7 m s 1 which was four orders of magnitude less than that in the cao2 system 2 r o 2 f k c h l o r o f o r m o 2 a k p h e n o l o 2 p h e n o l the dramatically enhanced production of o2 in the cao2 system has been suggested by using chloroform as the probe it should be noted that cao2 possesses reducibility by giving out one electron to produce o2 or two electrons to generate o2 in the cao2 system the active specie feiii edta is inclined to adsorb on the solid surface of cao2 to form a transition state like f e iii e d t a c a o 2 r11 then an inner sphere electron transfer can take place r12 that is electrons transfer from peroxide to feiii edta and result in the reduction of feiii edta and production of o2 which could be confined on the surface of solid and less affected by bulk phs the mechanism described in r11 and r12 can be further supported by the effect of feiii edta on the h2o2 release test fig 1a in the presence of feiii edta the initiate h2o2 concentration was about 76 of that in the absence of feiii edta and subsequently continuously decreased after 1 h this can be attributed to the promoted conversion of peroxide toward oxygen through a two step electron transfer as described by r11 and r4 therefore the intrinsic reductive ability in cao2 based fenton like reaction promotes the cycle of feiii feii so as to break through the limitation in the slow regeneration of feii r3 and enhance the production of oh for organic degradation r11 f e iii e d t a c a o 2 f e iii e d t a c a o 2 r12 f e iii e d t a c a o 2 h 2 o f e i i i e d t a c a o 2 e h 2 o f e ii e d t a c a a d s o 2 4 conclusions we demonstrated that cao2 based fenton like reaction is an efficient way to break through the limitation of the slow ferric reduction in the traditional h2o2 based system according to a comparison on phenol degradation in the cao2 feiii edta and h2o2 feiii edta systems and on the effect of parameters including feiii contents molar ratios of fe to edta oxidant dosages and ph values a distinct difference in the initial stage was observed phenol degradation in the h2o2 system had an initial latent time of 60 min while in the cao2 one the degradation can take place at the very beginning and phenol was removed completely in 30 min significantly high production of o2 in the cao2 based system was indicated by using chloroform as a probe the accelerated reaction was rationalized by the intrinsic reducibility of cao2 which provides one electron to reduce feiii and produce o2 and the latter one further promotes the reduction of ferric species although edta is persistent in the water other environmental friendly chelating agents like citric acid or edds could be employed in practical applications this work indicated that cao2 based fenton like reaction could be developed into an efficient aops to remove recalcitrant organic pollutant at neutral ph and also be a promising source of o2 for diverse applications in environment cleanup acknowledgments financial supports from the

19341,one challenge in h2o2 based fenton like reaction is to break through the limitation of slow reduction of ferric species feiii present work describes a dramatic acceleration of fenton like reaction at neutral ph by using calcium peroxide cao2 as a source of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and edta as a chelating agent of ferric ions in an optimized condition phenol degradation in the h2o2 system displayed an initial latent time of 60 min while phenol can be degraded immediately and removed completely in 30 min in the cao2 system visual minteq analyses indicated fe edta was the active species in the reaction the contribution of 1o2 in cao2 system was excluded by the poor selectivity in phenol conversion and the comparable 1o2 temp epr signals in both cao2 and h2o2 systems kinetic analyses using chloroform as the probe of o2 suggested the high production rate of o2 which is four orders of magnitude higher than that in h2o2 system the mechanism of the accelerated cao2 based fenton like reactions was featured by that two electrons coming from cao2 can be utilized to promote reduction of feiii an inner sphere electron transfer takes place to reduce feiii edta and produce o2 and subsequently o2 provides an electron to reduce another feiii edta the revealed intrinsic reducibility in cao2 based fenton like reaction represents a new strategy to break through the well known rate limiting step of feiii reduction in fenton like reaction and facilitate the removal of organic pollutants at neutral phs and also indicates a promising source of o2 for diverse applications graphical abstract image 1 keywords fenton like reaction calcium peroxide hydrogen peroxide superoxide radicals 1 introduction in order to remove recalcitrant organic contaminants in wastewater various types of advanced oxidation processes aops that are characterized by production of highly reactive hydroxyl radical oh have been developed chen et al 2018 hu and long 2016 among them fenton like reactions using hydrogen peroxide h2o2 and transition metal ions such as ferric ions as source chemicals have attracted great attention due to the merit of generation of oh at a relatively low cost and in an easy way kwan and voelker 2002 however one bottleneck for fenton like reactions is the well known ph limitation that is the efficiency significantly decreased at ph above 5 0 because iron ions would precipitate and the reaction r1 for oh production becomes thermodynamically unfavorable such ph limitation is contrary to the neutral or circumneutral phs in most ambient wastewater r1 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f

1 li et al 2016 lin and gurol 1998 one strategy to overcome the limitation is to use chelating agents such as ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds huang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 citric acid vicente et al 2011 and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta he et al 2015 kwon et al 2009 xia et al 2018 these chelating agents were used to complex iron to prevent its precipitation and change the redox properties of metal to make the reaction r2 thermodynamically feasible bienfait 1988 engelmann et al 2003 because of its ability to complex strongly with iron ions values of log k are 24 23 and 14 33 for ferrous or ferric ions respectively speight 2005 edta has been frequently applied in fenton like reactions to facilitate the degradation of organic pollutants at neutral phs the mechanism of fenton like reaction for h2o2 activation by feiii edta complexes can be described based on the classical haber weiss reaction kwon et al 2009 li et al 2016 lin and gurol 1998 feiii edta is reduced by h2o2 to produce feii edta r3 followed by oxidation of feii edta with h2o2 to continue the cycle r2 however since the reduction of feiii edta by h2o2 is very slow 0 002 0 01 m 1s 1 the cycle of feiii feii has been regarded as the rate determining step in both heterogeneous and homogeneous fenton like reactions pham et al 2009 accelerating the reduction of ferric species feiii is one of the most crucial challenges in fenton like aops several approaches were developed to break through the limitation on the slow reduction step the addition of reductive substance like ascorbic acid huang et al 2017 protocatechuic acid qin et al 2015 and hydroxylamine chen et al 2011 hou et al 2017 can facilitate the reduction of feiii in the solution or on the surface of solid catalysts the reductive intermediates produced in phenol degradation was found to significantly enhance phenol degradation due to the promoted reduction of feiii resulting in a self catalytic kinetics in degradation of phenolic compounds chen and pignatello 1997 du et al 2006 jin et al 2017 recently metal sulfides were employed as co catalysts to accelerate the cycle of feiii feii by forming reductive metallic active sites xing et al 2018 ultra dispersed fe3o4 nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide rgo nanosheets were prepared to improve the conversion efficiency of feiii feii by concentrating electrons on rgo surface qiu et al 2016 furthermore photo fenton like reaction can enhance the cycle of feiii feii by photoreduction of ferric complexes cieśla et al 2004 zou et al 2018 however the addition of reductive substance or external energy input would either compete with target organic pollutants for reactive oxygen species ros and decrease the utilization efficiency of h2o2 or increase the operation cost therefore it is great demanding to develop a novel cost efficient strategy to promote the cycle of feiii feii in fact the reduction of feiii by o2 is very fast r4 while only a few studies like the complex of feiii edds huang et al 2013 and mn2 mediation li et al 2016 reported the facilitated reduction of feiii in fenton like reaction by highlighting the o2 pathway nevertheless development of mechanistic strategies to increase the production of o2 at the initial reactions could be an effective way to promote fenton like reaction and facilitate its applications in

zhou et al 2017 reactions r5 and r6 describe the decomposition of cao2 in water which depends much on ph and temperature the release of h2o2 can take place over a wide ph range 6 12 bogan et al 2003 and the rate of h2o2 generation can be regulated by adjusting ph in fact cao2 has been widely investigated for decades in remediation of contaminated soil ndjou ou and cassidy 2006 xu et al 2011 and groundwater mosmeri et al 2017 qian et al 2015 due to its versatility and environmental friendliness thani et al 2016 although many of studies and applications of cao2 in fenton like reaction have been done the basic understanding on the intrinsic difference between cao2 and h2o2 based fenton like reaction should be improved in this study series of batch experiments on phenol degradation in cao2 feiii edta and h2o2 feiii edta fenton like reactions at neutral ph were conducted the notable differences between the two systems were understood by ros identification intermediate track electrochemical and kinetic analyses and the endogenetic reducibility of cao2 to facilitate fenton like reaction was finally revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this study were analytical grade without further purification cao2 75 0 was purchased from shanghai titan chemical reagent co ltd whose density and particle sizes are in the range of 500 650 g l and 75 150 μm respectively according to xrd patterns fig s1 the commercial cao2 is a composite of tetragonal cao2 about 75 and hexagonal ca oh 2 about 25 furfuryl alcohol ffa 2 2 6 6 tetramethylpiperidine temp 5

for high performance liquid chromatography hplc analyses was obtained from fisher science company fair lawn usa 2 2 release of h2o2 to determine the behavior of h2o2 released from cao2 at the neutral ph four batch tests were conducted cao2 alone cao2 and edta cao2 and feiii cao2 and feiii edta the tests were conducted at 30 c by using 1 g l cao2 0 7 mm fe no3 3 n edta n fe 1 7 and 50 mm phosphate buffer ph 7 0 the maximum theoretical concentration of h2o2 released from 1 g l cao2 is 13 9 mm samples were withdrawn at the predetermined time and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter for h2o2 measurements 2 3 organic degradation tests phenol solution 0 80 mm was prepared in a phosphate buffer 50 mm most phs of solutions were maintained at 7 0 except the tests on the effect of phs preliminary tests fig s2 indicated that 50 mm phosphate displayed slight inhibition on phenol degradation but can maintain ph variation in 0 2 units in the presence of 1 g l cao2 phenol degradation was conducted to investigate the performance of heterogeneous cao2 feiii edta and homogeneous h2o2 feiii edta systems the reaction was carried out in a conical flask with a magnetic stirrer under a speed of 500 rpm at 30 c in a typical experiment 1 4 mm fe no3 3 and edta was added into a 50 ml buffered phenol solution then 1 g l cao2 or 13 9 mm h2o2 was added to initiate the reaction samples were withdrawn at predetermined intervals quenched immediately by methanol and then analyzed by hplc three more aromatic compounds o dhb ba and 4 cp were used to explore the oxidation performance of the two fenton like reaction systems 2 4 analytic methods the concentration of h2o2 in aqueous phase was measured according to a metavanadate method ling et al 2014 nogueira et al 2005 briefly samples were withdrawn and filtered through a 0 22 μm filter 1 ml sample and 1 ml ammonium metavanadate 62 mm were injected into a colorimetric tube diluting to 10 ml with deionized water solutions were detected by a uv vis spectrophotometer wfj 7200 unic at 450 nm after developing color quantitative analyses of the residual organics and intermediates were performed using a hplc shimadzu lc 20ad equipped with a shim pack c18 chromatographic column zorbax eclipse xdb c18 and an uv vis detector spd 20av detailed hplc analytical conditions including mobile phase flow rate and the detection wavelength are listed in table s1 all experiments were conducted in triplicate epr measurements were used to detect the existence of oh and 1o2 the sweep width were set to 100 g and 115 4 g for the spin traps of dmpo and temp respectively microwave power and microwave frequency were set at 15 mw and 9 85 ghz in the tests the electrochemical measurements were detected with a computer controlled chi 760 electrochemical workstation in cyclic voltammetry cv measurements a standard three electrode configuration including a glassy carbon electrode as a working electrode an ag agcl electrode as a reference electrode and a platinum counter electrode was used to track the open circuit potential of pt electrode another pt electrode and a saturated calomel electrode were applied as the working electrode and counter electrode respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 release of h2o2 and phenol degradation the release of h2o2 from 1 g l cao2 slurry in phosphate buffer 50 mm ph 7 0 was recorded fig 1 a the h2o2 concentration after the immediate addition of cao2 was 4 01 mm and then reached an equilibrium concentration in 1 h which was 10 3 mm about 75 of the theoretical value for the completely conversion of cao2 the presence of edta or feiii had negligible influence on the release of h2o2 the slightly reduction of h2o2 beginning from 4 h could be due to the catalyzed decomposition of h2o2 by the few dissolved ferric species however the concentration of h2o2 decreased in the presence of feiii edta complex the initial h2o2 concentration was 3 43 mm indicating the interaction between cao2 and feiii edta the maximum generation of h2o2 was 9 3 mm at 1 h then continuously decreased to 7 8 mm at 24 h this could be due to the consumption of h2o2 by feiii edta or intermediates a comparison of phenol degradation in different fenton like systems at neutral ph ph 7 0 is shown in fig 1b using h2o2 13 9 mm as the oxidant and feiii edta as the catalyst the initial phenol degradation was very slow only achieving 12 1 reduction in the first 2 h however phenol degradation was significantly accelerated after 2 h and 89 4 phenol reduction was obtained after 8 h reaction this initial period before a sudden increase in the reaction rate was named as latent time luo et al 2009 such a self catalysis phenomenon in phenol degradation through fenton or fenton like reactions has been attributed to the generation of reductive intermediates like p hq or o dhb which possesses the ability to accelerate the cycle of feiii feii du et al 2006 jin et al 2017 when using cao2 1 g l equivalent of 13 9 mm h2o2 instead of h2o2 phenol degradation started as soon as the addition of the oxidant fig 1b there was no latent time in the cao2 based system without iron species in the cao2 suspension there was negligible phenol reduction after 24 h suggesting that the oxidation power of cao2 is not strong enough to directly oxidize phenol the time dependent h2o2 concentrations during phenol degradation in the oxidation systems of fig 1b were presented in fig 1c it is obviously that few h2o2 consumed in the absence of feiii edta resulting in negligible removal of phenol the largest reductions of h2o2 concentrations occurred at 0 5 1 5 h and 2 4 h in cao2 feiii edta and h2o2 feiii edta systems respectively utilization efficiency of h2o2 was defined as the amount of hydrogen peroxide decomposed leading to per unit molar of phenol conversion the utilization efficiencies in the significant phenol removal periods in the two systems were compared results showed that in cao2 feiii edta system 0 5 1 5 h the value was 3 47 mol h2o2 mol phenol better than that in h2o2 feiii edta system 2 4 h 4 31 mol h2o2 mol phenol therefore above comparisons indicated that the fenton like reactions using cao2 and h2o2 as oxidants have essential differences 3 2 effects of reaction parameters the effect of reaction parameters on phenol degradation was investigated in a buffered cao2 system fig 2 and compared with those in the h2o2 system fig s3 cao2 fig 2a and iron dosages fig 2b were optimized as 1 g l and 1 4 mm respectively phenol degradation rate increasing with more cao2 dosage was due to the production of more h2o2 however excess cao2 would increase the slurry s ph because the buffer 50 mm phosphate capacity was not strong enough to maintain the ph at such high dosages although increasing the iron dosage accelerated phenol degradation fig 2b the difference on the degradation rates for 1 4 and 2 1 mm iron species was negligible it could be attributed to the balance between the iron species and the released h2o2 when the iron dosage was above 1 4 mm in the absence of edta phenol degradation is negligible due to the precipitation of ferric irons the addition of edta significantly improved phenol degradation fig 2c with an increase in molecular ratio of edta to fe from 1 7 to 1 2 phenol removal in 30 min increased from 27 to 100 in the range from 1 2 to 2 1 the difference in phenol degradation was negligible this was because excess organic chelates like edta could compete with phenol for ros zhou et al 2017 however in the h2o2 system fig s3a phenol started degradation at about 60 min for all ratios of edta to fe and the optimal ratio was 1 1 which is the theoretical ratio in feiii edta complex francis et al 1985 rush and koppenol 1988 this indicated that latent time in h2o2 system could not be altered by enhancing the ratio of edta to fe since phenol degradation efficiencies when the ratio of edta to fe at 1 2 and 1 1 were close the ratio of edta to fe was set as 1 2 for further tests the effects of ph on phenol degradation in both systems are shown in fig 2d and fig s3b the cao2 system worked well in the ph range of 3 7 and phenol removal efficiency after 60 min can reach 100 at all of these phs however the reaction was notably inhibited when ph was above 7 0 in the h2o2 system the favorable ph range was narrow and obvious phenol degradation can only be achieved in the ph range of 6 7 fig s3b both acidic and basic conditions inhibited h2o2 activation and phenol degradation the poor activity at basic conditions could either be attributed to the tendency of cao2 to decompose into o2 instead of h2o2 wang et al 2016 or be ascribed to the presence of less active species at high phs nevertheless the poor activity at acidic ph in the h2o2 system can be attributed to the strong inhibited regeneration of feii edta due to the formation of perhydroxyl radical ooh of which the rate constant for the reduction of feiii is around 3 4 orders of magnitude less than that of o2 li et al 2016 the satisfactory activity of cao2 at acidic phs indicated that there was a pathway for the cycle of feiii feii which has not been limited by ooh iron species in the buffered feiii edta solution were simulated and analyzed by a chemical speciation model visual minteq software version 3 1 to understand the influence of ph and the ratio of edta to fe when the ratio of edta to fe increased fig 3 a the percentages of complexed iron species including feedta feohedta2 and fe2 oh 2edta2 4 increased accompanied with the increase of phenol degradation rates fig 2c however in the ph range of 3 7 that phenol can be efficiently degraded the amounts of feohedta2 and fe2 oh 2edta2 4 were negligible fig 3b at high phs and low dosages of edta other soluble iron species like fe oh 2 fe oh 4 fehpo4 became predominate resulting in a very low phenol removal efficiency this indicates that their contribution to h2o2 activation was negligible moreover a linearity relationship was found between the percentages of feedta and phenol degradation rate constants at different ratios of edta to fe fig s4 suggesting that feedta was the most important active species in h2o2 activation in this fenton like system furthermore activation of h2o2 by metal chelates can be estimated by the chemical reaction potential of r2 0 46 e m at ph 7 e m is the redox potential of f e ii l f e iii l couple the redox potential of the couple feiii edta feii edta was measured as 0 14 v vs nhe in the presence of phosphate fig s5 which was close to the reported value 0 13 v vs nhe bienfait 1988 but much lower than fe3 fe2 couple 0 77 v vs nhe indicating the h2o2 activation reaction was thermodynamically favorable due to the reaction potential of r2 become positive 0 32 v vs nhe better initial performance for phenol degradation detected in the cao2 based fenton like system was also applicable for other aromatic compounds fig s6 the removal efficiencies in h2o2 system for 4 cp and ba in the first 30 min were only 8 6 and 10 respectively subsequently both organics can be degraded in 180 min this suggested an initial latent time and self catalysis mechanism in degradation of both compounds the initial degradation of 4 cp and ba in cao2 system was obviously faster than that in the h2o2 system nevertheless degradation of o dhb a well known reductive intermediate in phenol degradation are comparable in both systems 75 mg l o dhb was completely degraded within 30 min the absence of initial latent time for o dhb can be understood by the accelerated generation of ferrous species in the presence of reductive o dhb jin et al 2017 rodriguez et al 2001 the results suggested that using cao2 as an oxidant can significantly accelerate the initial degradation of various aromatic compounds in fenton like reactions experiments on the effect of cao2 additions in the h2o2 systems fig s7 were conducted in the tests the total theoretical molar amount of h2o2 was 13 9 mm and the molar percentage of cao2 were 100 50 33 25 20 and 0 the results suggested that cao2 addition accelerated the initial phenol degradation the phenol degradation rate increased with more cao2 addition it further proved the favorable effect of cao2 in fenton like reactions 3 3 mechanism on cao2 based fenton like reaction in order to explore the reasons for phenol degradation improvement in the heterogeneous cao2 based fenton like reaction several control tests including using ca oh 2 quartz sand and aged cao2 were carried out as shown in fig 4 a compared with the homogeneous h2o2 feiii edta system the addition of quartz sand did not show any favorable effect while ca oh 2 obviously shortened the latent time for phenol degradation to 30 min ca oh 2 is the final product of cao2 decomposition in water r5 and r6 this indicated that the promoted initial phenol degradation depended much on the characteristic of solid species the favorable effect of ca oh 2 could be attributed to the conversion tendency of ca oh 2 and h2o2 toward cao2 qian et al 2013 furthermore instead of using fresh cao2 to initiate degradation the aged cao2 the same dosage of cao2 stirred for 2 h in phosphate buffer was used and feiii edta solution and phenol was subsequently added to start fenton like reaction it can be expected that the main species in the aged cao2 suspension are freshly produced ca oh 2 and h2o2 in this case the initial phenol degradation was slightly slower than the fresh cao2 system but much faster than the ca oh 2 and h2o2 system the oxidation performance of fresh cao2 system was optimal the changes in the pt electrode potential in the initial fenton like reaction were measured to evaluate the initial reduction of feiii edta in the tests edta and ferric ions were added into a buffered ph 7 phenol solution and the mixture were stirred for 10 min and then the oxidant 13 9 mm h2o2 or 1 g l cao2 was injected into the solution to initiate the reaction as shown in fig 4b the pt electrode potential decreased immediately after the addition of oxidants and reached balance at 1600 s which was a combination result of reductive substance including the added h2o2 and the in situ generated feii edta chen et al 2002 however the decreased potential of cao2 system was obviously higher than that of h2o2 system at the initial time and the difference was as much as 49 6 mv at the balance time this indicated that much more reductive substance was present in the cao2 system considering the maximum released h2o2 concentration in the cao2 suspension was 25 less than that in h2o2 system and simultaneously there was significant consumption of h2o2 due to immediate phenol degradation such a decreased potential in cao2 suspension was an indication of significantly higher contents of reductive substance furthermore in the presence of ca oh 2 in the h2o2 system the decreased potential at the balance time was 10 2 mv higher than that in the absence of ca oh 2 it further verified the favorable effect of both cao2 and ca oh 2 in accelerating the reduction of feiii edta to explore the reasons for the promoted reduction of feiii edta to feii edta the main ros for phenol degradation were investigated by scavenger tests and epr spectra measurements methanol chloroform and l histidine were used as the respective scavenger of oh o2 and 1o2 k m e t h a n o l o h 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 k chloroform o 2 3 0 1010 m 1 s 1 k l h i s t i d i n e 1 o 2 3 2 107 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 davies 2003 wang et al 2017 wilkinson et al 1995 in both systems methanol strongly inhibited phenol degradation indicating the predominate role of oh in phenol degradation fig 5 a and b the existence of oh in cao2 system was also proved by epr spectrum fig 5c as the four peaks with the intensity ratio of 1 2 2 1 were the indication of the spin adduct dmpo oh although there is controversy on the main active species high valent iron or oh in fenton like reactions at the neutral ph rush and koppenol 1988 yamazaki and piette 1991 our results suggested the significant contribution of oh in the reactions chloroform displayed inhibitory effect on phenol degradation in the cao2 system but slightly accelerated phenol degradation in the h2o2 system the slightly accelerated phenol degradation in the latter one could be attributed to the formation of other reactive radicals rodriguez chueca et al 2016 the result of feiii edta was different from the previous report that using fe iii edds as the catalyst for h2o2 activation in which o2 was produced to facilitate bisphenol a degradation huang et al 2013 it indicated that fe iii edta alone was not a source of aqueous electrons or o2 in the fenton like reaction the inhibitory effect of chloroform in cao2 system indicated that o2 showed important contribution for phenol degradation although epr spectrum can be applied for o2 detection zheng et al 2017 2018 the signals were indiscernible in the methanol suspension with cao2 and feiii edta xue et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 amina et al 2018 this could be attributed to the different decomposition behavior of cao2 in methanol l histidine the frequently employed scavenger of 1o2 obviously suppressed degradation of phenol in both systems the occurrence of 1o2 was further proved by epr spectra using temp as the spin trap as shown in fig 5d the typical peaks of the spin adduct temp 1o2 exhibiting three peaks at the intensity ratio of 1 1 1 were observed in both h2o2 and cao2 systems duan et al 2018 he et al 2014 it is known that 1o2 can be produced by o2 r7 and through a disproportionation reaction of h2o2 that catalyzed by ca ii in the cao2 system as described by r8 in which the precursor was regarded as cao2 2h2o2 nardello et al 1998 li et al 2018 however the reaction rate constant between l histidine and oh is also high 5 109 m 1 s 1 the inhibition from l histidine cannot be exclusively attributed to the 1o2 r7 2 o 2 2 h 2 o h 2 o 2 2 o h 1 o 2 r8 2 h 2 o 2 c a i i 2 h 2 o α 1 o 2 1 α 3 o 2 the produced 1o2 can react with phenol and produce reductive bisphenol or quinone intermediates through a non radical pathway and subsequently promotes the reduction of feiii edta and enhances the generation of oh the intermediates of p hq and o dhb in both systems were tracked fig 6 a in cao2 system o dhb and p hq were generated immediately after the addition of the oxidant and their concentrations continuously increased to a maximum yield of 32 8 mg l at 20 min and 20 5 mg l at 15 min respectively after 1 h most of the intermediates converted into small molecular acid co2 and h2o liu et al 2018 it was reported that the reaction between phenol and 1o2 should form selectively hydroxylated products at the para position that is p hq scheme s1 briviba et al 1993 however o dhb and p hq were simultaneously produced and their concentrations were comparable indicating the poor selectivity toward p hq in the oxidation of phenol in cao2 system furthermore no reductive intermediate can be detected at the first 45 min in the h2o2 system although comparable 1o2 can be measured fig 5d this can be understood by the reaction rate constants of water and phenol with 1o2 water owns a high first order rate constant with 1o2 k water 2 5 105 s 1 resulting in that its reaction rate was over 300 times higher than phenol at its present concentrations k phenol 1 0 106 m 1 s 1 therefore the occurrence of 1o2 had very low opportunity to react with phenol however the favorable role of 1o2 could be much improved in degradation of ffa which has a high rate constant with 1o2 k ffa 1 2 108 m 1 s 1 about two orders of magnitude higher than that of phenol wilkinson et al 1995 as shown in fig 6b the degradation rate of ffa was dramatically higher than that of phenol in h2o2 system and the latent time disappeared however in cao2 system the difference between phenol and ffa degradation became smaller this is also an evidence to against the important contribution of 1o2 in the cao2 system meanwhile results in fig 6b suggest that cao2 is superior to h2o2 in fenton like degradation of both phenol and ffa r9 o h h 2 o 2 h 2 o o 2 h k 1 2 4 5 10 7 li et al 2016 walling 1975 r10 o h o 2 h 2 o o 2 k 8 9 10 9 kwan and voelker 2002 the enhanced phenol degradation in the cao2 system can also be caused by the enhanced generation of o2 because of the high reaction rate constant between o2 and feiii 107 108 m 1s 1 r4 according to the chemiluminescence and uv vis spectra ma et al proved the presence of oh and o2 on the surface of cao2 in contact with water and assumed the reaction r9 to suggest that o2 was originated from oh and h2o2 in cao2 suspension ma et al 2007 however it can be expected that the concentration of oh is very low and o2 could also be quickly consumed by oh r10 whose reaction rate constant is at least one order of magnitude faster than that with feiii edta ma et al 2007 moreover change of phenol concentration in the cao2 system was unobservable in the absence of feiii edta indicating feiii edta was indispensable for generation of considerable ros oh or o2 kinetic analyses were further carried out based on the effect of chloroform dosages on phenol degradation in the cao2 system as shown in fig 7 a phenol degradation was strongly inhibited in the presence of chloroform and the inhibitory strengthened with the increase of chloroform concentrations latent time for phenol degradation became notable in the presence of 40 mm chloroform fig 7b shows the relationship between initial degradation rates of phenol r p h e n o l d m s 1 and chloroform dosages according to a steady state approximation of o2 r p h e n o l d can be calculated according to

with the equation of y 1 ax b and a represents for k c h l o r o f o r m o 2 r o 2 f k p h e n o l o 2 p h e n o l then r o 2 f can be obtained as 4 5 10 3 m s 1 according to eq 2 however in h2o2 system according to the concentrations of h2o2 13 9 mm and iron 1 4 mm and the k value 0 01 m 1s 1 of reaction r3 the formation rate of o2 was only 1 9 10 7 m s 1 which was four orders of magnitude less than that in the cao2 system 2 r o 2 f k c h l o r o f o r m o 2 a k p h e n o l o 2 p h e n o l the dramatically enhanced production of o2 in the cao2 system has been suggested by using chloroform as the probe it should be noted that cao2 possesses reducibility by giving out one electron to produce o2 or two electrons to generate o2 in the cao2 system the active specie feiii edta is inclined to adsorb on the solid surface of cao2 to form a transition state like f e iii e d t a c a o 2 r11 then an inner sphere electron transfer can take place r12 that is electrons transfer from peroxide to feiii edta and result in the reduction of feiii edta and production of o2 which could be confined on the surface of solid and less affected by bulk phs the mechanism described in r11 and r12 can be further supported by the effect of feiii edta on the h2o2 release test fig 1a in the presence of feiii edta the initiate h2o2 concentration was about 76 of that in the absence of feiii edta and subsequently continuously decreased after 1 h this can be attributed to the promoted conversion of peroxide toward oxygen through a two step electron transfer as described by r11 and r4 therefore the intrinsic reductive ability in cao2 based fenton like reaction promotes the cycle of feiii feii so as to break through the limitation in the slow regeneration of feii r3 and enhance the production of oh for organic degradation r11 f e iii e d t a c a o 2 f e iii e d t a c a o 2 r12 f e iii e d t a c a o 2 h 2 o f e i i i e d t a c a o 2 e h 2 o f e ii e d t a c a a d s o 2 4 conclusions we demonstrated that cao2 based fenton like reaction is an efficient way to break through the limitation of the slow ferric reduction in the traditional h2o2 based system according to a comparison on phenol degradation in the cao2 feiii edta and h2o2 feiii edta systems and on the effect of parameters including feiii contents molar ratios of fe to edta oxidant dosages and ph values a distinct difference in the initial stage was observed phenol degradation in the h2o2 system had an initial latent time of 60 min while in the cao2 one the degradation can take place at the very beginning and phenol was removed completely in 30 min significantly high production of o2 in the cao2 based system was indicated by using chloroform as a probe the accelerated reaction was rationalized by the intrinsic reducibility of cao2 which provides one electron to reduce feiii and produce o2 and the latter one further promotes the reduction of ferric species although edta is persistent in the water other environmental friendly chelating agents like citric acid or edds could be employed in practical applications this work indicated that cao2 based fenton like reaction could be developed into an efficient aops to remove recalcitrant organic pollutant at neutral ph and also be a promising source of o2 for diverse applications in environment cleanup acknowledgments financial supports from the

19342,removal of total polyphenols tpp is not only necessary as a pretreatment stepfor anaerobic digestion of wine wastewaters www but also the recovered polyphenols can be used as a dietary supplement with a view to make the process sustainable eco efficient and cost effective exhausted grape pomace egp after the extraction of polyphenols was impregnated with zncl2 1 1 5 and further activated at 450 c for 1 h under inert atmosphere the gpac grape pomace activated carbon thus developed exhibited well developed porosity with a predominance of micropores high surface area and selective surface binding sites batch adsorption conducted on diluted www revealed the better performance of gpac 84 3 removal as compared to egp 48 5 removal under similar conditions with maximum adsorption taking place at ph 3 8 while ph studies indicated a possible electron donor acceptor mechanism in the binding of tpp kinetic studies indicated that diffusion was mediated by the porosity in gpac isotherm studies conducted on gpac and commercial carbon cac revealed multilayer binding under www while langmuir model was operative under simulated conditions contrary to the better performance of cac the same for gpac was comparable at higher dosage where 80 tpp was removed from undiluted www the phenol adsorption capacity of gpac from real 28 4 mg g and from simulated wastewater 142 6 mg g was higher as compared to other reported adsorbents desorption of tpp from loaded gpac was maximum 91 with 1 1 ethanol water solvent the results reveal a sustainable eco friendly solution for valorisation of exhausted grape pomace for recovery of polyphenols from wine wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords exhausted grape pomace chemical activation polyphenols recovery wine wastewater adsorption valorisation 1 introduction winery wastewater www is classified as a biodegradable agro industrial effluent containing predominantly soluble organic wastes and which constitutes a major source of environmental pollution andreottola et al 2009 sheridan et al 2011 strong 2008 the discharge of such wastewater to water bodies is associated with major risks to the environment associated with eutrophication death of aquatic life etc this is because of the high organic load and the significant presence of total polyphenols tpp in the www quayle et al 2009 while the monocyclic phenolic components present in the www are responsible for phytotoxicity and antibacterial effects the more recalcitrant polymeric phenols impart the characteristic undesirable color to such wastewater torrijos and moletta 1997 on the other hand the high organic load and the favourable cod n p chemical oxygen demand nitrogen phosphorus ratio can be better utilised in the treatment of www via anaerobic digestion ad which in turn can achieve both goals of its decontamination and valorisation of the organic fraction by means of methane production moletta 2005 nayak et al 2017a ros et al 2016 ruíz et al 2002 however the polyphenols present in www are known to induce inhibitory effect on the microbial activity and can induce undesired effects on the biological treatment process such as decrease in the rate of elimination and or longer treatment times rosenkranz et al 2013 the negative effect of polyphenol degradation can be physiological via inhibition of metabolism as well as can be structurally linked to modification of community composition removal of polyphenols is thus not only an essential step for the pretreatment of www prior to the ad technique but also the recovered polyphenols can be used as food additives nutraceuticals and in cosmetics arnous et al 2001 galanakis et al 2018a b c lafka et al 2007 saura calixto 1998 antioxidants as present in natural phenolic compounds in grape pomace are known to contribute to the health benefits through various mechanisms like quenching of free radicals chelating transition metals reducing peroxides and stimulating antioxidative enzyme defense jayaprakasha et al 2003 negro et al 2003 among the various techniques that have been adopted to remove recover the less biodegradable organic compounds like polyphenols from wastewaters adsorption has been cited as a powerful environmental friendly technology gupta et al 2014 ioannou et al 2014 but the high cost of the commercial activated carbon as well as the non environmental friendly measures adopted for its regeneration reuse is a major deterrent to its widespread use in wastewater treatment bansal and goyal 2005 dabrowski 2001 also the saturated activated carbon is itself a solid waste and its unsafe disposal practices impose further sustainability issues in this respect organic based lignocellulosic waste by products from agricultural and forest residues have proved to be cheaper and sustainable alternatives for the synthesis of quality activated carbons and their subsequent use for wastewater treatment gupta et al 2015 nayak et al 2017b review articles published in 2005 dabrowski et al 2005 and in 2008 ahmaruzzaman 2008 have summarised the successful separation of phenolic compounds from wastewaters by the use of commercial activated carbons biosorbents and non conventional activated carbons prepared from a wide range of precursors ranging from natural industrial lignocellulosic based agricultural forest residues biomass etc in this respect grape pomace gp due to its large scale generation in the mediterranean region as well as its favourable lignocellulosic based characteristics could serve as a potential low cost substrate for the preparation of quality adsorbent and its subsequent use in water treatment studies reveal that gp is a source of dietary fiber and antioxidants from which polyphenols have been extracted nayak et al 2018 but its use as an efficient biosorbent has also been reported for the separation of cr vi chand et al 2009 and mycotoxin from aqueous suspension avantaggiato et al 2014 activated carbons developed via thermal methods from gp has also demonstrated to be a low cost adsorbent for separation of heavy metals from wastewater nayak et al 2016 deiana et al 2014 sardella et al 2015 but till date no such studies have been reported on the use of gp as a precursor for activated carbon biosorbent for the removal recovery of polyphenolic compounds from wastewaters chemical activation has been successfully applied on various low cost widely available precursors for the development of activated carbons considering its many advantages vis à vis thermal methods and the fact that such has not been applied earlier on gp the present study thus has a focus in preparing chemicallyactivated carbon gpac from exhausted gp after extraction of polyphenols for the removal and recovery of polyphenols from a real winery effluent the reason for selection of exhausted gp as a precursor for the development of gpac was to maximise the valorisation efficiency of gp zncl2 impregnated exhausted gp was appropriately activated under inert atmosphere and the developed gpac was assessed for its physico chemical characteristics and to correlate its structural characteristics with its adsorptive performance the adosrption efficiency of gpac was studied onto real www collected from an experimental winery the www revealed the presence of solids besides the high organic content for which a series of pretreatment methods were carried out prior to the application of the adsorption technique the kinetic studies were conducted in batch mode and experimentally optimised to maximise the removal of polyphenols from the pretreated www isotherm studies were conducted on real winery effluent as well as on simulated water so as to study the behaviour of the gpac under different wastewater conditions the performance of gpac was also monitored vis a vis a commercial activated carbon cac thus attempt was made in the present study not only to access the adsorptive nature of the gpac for the separation of polyphenols from a real winery effluent but also the mechanism of the binding process was extensively evaluated on both real and simulated wastewater conditions desorption studies helped to recover the adsorbed polyphenols from gpac by optimising the solvent types 2 materials and methods 2 1 cac gp and www samples commercial activated carbon cac was purchased from sigma aldrich pressed grape pomace gp and wine wastewater www samples were collected after the red vinification from the experimental winery mas friars the centre linked to the faculty of oenology of universitat rovirai virgilli urv at tarragona spain the wastewater was stored at 4 c for further experimental activity to avoid any biochemical reactions simulated wastewater having varying gallic acid concentration 50 1200 mg l was prepared in the laboratory to assess the performance of gpac under both simulated and real www conditions and also to make a comparative assessment of the binding mechanism the pressed pomace was received having a moisture content of 76 the gp samples were oven dried in a conventional oven maintained at 100 5 c for 24 h at atmospheric pressure dried gp samples were milled in a food processing grinder and finally stored in polythene bags polyphenols were recovered using conventional solvent solid extraction as well as via ultrasonication assisted techniques from gp nayak et al 2018 the study revealed that the exhausted grape pomace egp was organic in nature having a rich mixture of dietary fiber protein sugars and a low mineralogical content 2 2 development of gpac approximately 250 g of the oven dried exhausted grape pomace egp after extraction of polyphenols was impregnated with zncl2 solution having a concentration of 750 g l the impregnation ratio maintained was 1 1 5 the mixing was performed at 80 c for 3 h in a magnetic stirrer the slurry thus obtained was oven dried at 100 c for 24 h the product was further activated to 450 c for 1 h under continuous n2 gas flow 100 ml min in a stainless steel fixed bed tubular reactor equipped with an automatic control system flow pressure temperature the sample after cooling was soaked with 0 5 n hcl solutions for 24 h to remove adhering chemicals and ashes the sample was washed repeatedly with hot distilled water and finally with cold distilled water until the ph of the wash water was neutral the sample was dried in an oven at 110 c for 24 h the sample designated as gpac after grinding and sieving to a particle size of 150 200 μm was stored in separate plastic containers until required 2 3 physico chemical analysis of egp gpac and cac the surface area characteristics with respect to bet surface area sbet micropore surface area

tristar 3000 nayak et al 2017b the surface texture and morphology of the samples were examined using jeoljsm7100f scanning electron microscope sem before the scanning process all samples were dried and coated with gold under vacuum in a jfc 1600 sputter coater jeol japan for 20 min to enhance the electron conductivity the sem micrographs were henceforth taken at different magnifications the methodology as outlined in an earlier study nayak et al 2017b was adopted for the determination of surface acidity basicity and phpzc of the samples besides the functional moieties on the surface of the samples was determined from the infrared spectra as recorded in a infrared spectrophotometer perkin elmer usa small quantity of each sample was mixed with kbr crystals at a ratio of 1 mg sample 100 mg kbr and then grinded to produce a very fine powder the powder was then placed in a stainless steel die and compressed to produce a disc the formed disc was then placed in the ftir instrument and scanned intransmission mode through wave number range from 4000 to 400 cm 1 before each measurement the instrument was run to collect the background which was then automatically subtracted from the sample spectra 2 4 chemical analysis of www ph studies were conducted on a ph meter model cyberscan510 singapore total solids ts volatile solids vs total suspended solids tss were determined as per standard methods apha 1998 the cod was determined by digestion of the water samples in a cod digester at 150 c for 2 h followed by photometric determination hannah instruments soluble cod was determined in a similar method after vacuum filtration through 0 45 μm filters the organic content of www was determined by a certified commercial laboratory analiza barcelona the tpp total polyphenols of www were determined spectrophotometrically with a uv vis spectrophotometer perkin elmer model lambda 35 at 760 nm using the folin test slinkard and singleton 1977 gallic acid served as the standard for preparing calibration curve ranging from 5 to 200 mg l assay solution all measurements were conducted in triplicate and the average value was interpolated in a standard gallic acid calibration curve total polyphenol content of the sample was expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents per liter of wastewater mg gae l 2 5 pretreatment of www the high solids content in www required an initial pretreatment a low cost energy efficient slow filtration method using a packed bed column with sand was used the setup is shown in fig s1 the slow sand filtration technique is known to efficiently remove turbidity suspended solids toxic metals as well as pathogens in untreated or treated water verma et al 2017 sand filtration was performed in batch mode in a gravity column under downward flow diameter of column 4 cm the sand selected for the study had the following characteristics sea sand washed thin grain sio2 mol wt 60 09 g l thin grain particle size 0 25 0 30 mm soluble matter in hcl 0 2 loss on drying 0 2 chloride 0 015 the www was centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm and the initial feed of the centrifuged www into the column was 1 l the feeding was made by a peristaltic pump the bed height maintained was 10 cm a low filtration rate maintained was 0 1 l min and a total of 5 cycles was continued till a constant cod and turbidity was attained turbidity and cod was measured before and after each filtration stage in order to define a filtration protocol as a pre treatment for the adsorption process 2 6 batch adsorption tests the adsorption tests were conducted in batch mode in which a fixed adsorbent dosage was contacted in 250 ml of www the experimental conditions maintained were at a fixed temperature and ph while the batch tests were conducted taking varying concentrations of www at fixed contact time during isotherm studies the same was conducted at fixed www concentrations under different contact times during kinetic studies in all experiments the adsorbent adsorbate system was agitated in a temperature controlled water bath shaker at 100 rpm the concentration of total polyphenols tpp of wastewaters initial and final was determined spectrophotometrically with a uv vis spectrophotometer perkin elmer model lambda 35 at 760 nm using the folin test slinkard and singleton 1977 all the experiments were assessed in triplicate and average values were reported blank runs with only the adsorbents were conducted simultaneously under similar conditions and corrections made wherever necessary the adsorption uptake qe mg g was calculated as 1 qe co ce v w 2 removal co ce co 100 where co and ce are the initial and final tpp concentrations mg l respectively v is the volume of solution l and w is the weight of adsorbent g 2 7 batch desorption tests immediately after the adsorption step desorption step was carried out to assess the recovery efficiency of the tpp from the loaded gpac into the liquid phase adsorption experiments were conducted as described in sec 2 6 in 250 ml of the real wine wastewater www having a tpp concentration of 856 mg l and agitated with 8 g l gpac for 2 h in a water bath shaker the loaded gpac recovered after filtration was contacted with 250 ml of the desorbing solvent and the system was agitated for 2 h in the water bath shaker at 100 rpm maintained at 25 c the type of solvent has an important effect on the desorption of polyphenols from the adsorbent matrix hence desorption experiments were carried out using different solvents separately i e distilled water ethanol water mixtre of 3 1 1 1 1 3 100 ethanol and ethyl acetate the liquid phase after filtration was analysed for tpp spectrophotometrically as outlined in sec 2 6 the desorption was calculated as

adsorbed during the adsorption experiments 3 results 3 1 www characterisation as evident from table 1 the www had a high cod of 182 45 g l and an acidic ph of 3 8 reflecting the presence of significant amount of organic matter soluble to total cod of 93 indicates that majority of organic substances in the www are biodegradable and may hence be valorised via anaerobic digestion ad techniques to produce biofuels nayak et al 2017a significant proportions of carbohydrates 20 36 ethanol 7 5 fatty acids and polyphenols are contributory to the high cod of the www the presence of a high solid content of the www ts 127 g l and tds 7 g l reveals the requirement of its pretreatment also due to the significant presence of the tpp in the www 856 mg l and considering its toxicity to the microbial community the present study was focussed in a pretreatment of www to reduce the high solids content b development and characterisation of gpac from exhausted gp c assessment of gpac as adsorbent for removal recovery of tpp from www d and finally assessment and comparision of the mechanism of binding of tpp onto gpac and cac under different wastewater conditions simulated and real www 3 2 surface characterisation of gpac and egp selection of appropriate operating conditions during the chemical impregnation and subsequent activation can bring about significant changes in the physico chemical characteristics of the activated carbon and which can ultimately influence the efficiency of its performace as an adsorbent based on the preliminary results obtained gpac was prepared in this study under zncl2 impregnation of the exhausted grape pomace ratio of impregnation 1 1 5 and further activated at a lower temperature of 450 c under inert atmosphere for 1 h preliminary trials revealed the better performance of the activated carbon prepared from egp with zncl2 impregnation having an impregnation ratio of 1 1 5 comparision of the surface textural results table 2 as determined from n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 1 a b 1c revealed a higher bet surface area of 764 2 m2 g and 565 7 m2 g in gpac and cac respectively the corresponding micropore area of gpac and cac were 538 3 m2 g and 333 m2 g the egp on the other hand demonstrated a non porous surface morphology fig 1a shows increased adsorption of n2 occurring on the surface of gpac at low relative pressures followed by a nearly horizontal plateau at higher relative pressures thereby reflecting the presence and dominance of microporosity in gpac a small hysteresis loop is observed which is associated with capillary condensation inside mesopores indicating the presence of mesopores the isotherm fig 1c in cac although similar to that in fig 1a but indicates the dominance of mesoporosity as evident from the hysteresis loop the corresponding isotherms fig 1b as obtained from egp sample represent the absence of porosity infinite adsorption is observed at relative pressures p po approaching 1 and this indicates the presence of a uniform surface and multilayer adsorption of n2 in egp fig 2 a showing the porosity and pore size distribution as determined from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms confirmed the predominance of micropores in gpac which was to the tune of 60 9 of the total pores as can be seen in table 2 the total pore volume determined was 0 33 cc g with an average pore width of 17 3 å the microporosity in cac fig 2c determined was 41 confirming the dominance of mesoporosity the average pore width calculated was 31 8 å as is evident from fig 2b the egp sample has a wider pore size distribution with a significant proportion of pores in the diameter range greater than 500 å the average pore width determined was 252 6 å the surface morphology as can be seen from the fe sem images of the surface of gpac fig 3 a reveals the presence of nearly similar sized particles having an average size of 100 μm the images taken at a higher magnification of 25kx fig 3b and 50kx fig 3c of individual particles of gpac show the presence of well defined pores with micro and nano sizes fig 3d showing the image of egp at a magnification of 10kx reveals the absence of porosity in the particles the average particle size recorded was 100 μm fig not shown the image of cac fig 3e on the other hand reveals the presence of irregularly sized particles with an average particle size of 10 μm higher magnification at 50kx fig 3f reveals the agglomerates of smaller particles having an average dimension of 100 nm as a result of activation the carbon content showed a significant increase from 34 7 in egp to 86 1 in gpac table 2 the oxygen and hydrogen content of the gpac were within the range recommended for a typical activated carbon bansal and goyal 2005 the ftir spectra of egp fig 4 b reveals a broad and strong peak at 3600 3100 cm 1 and variable peaks at 2000 1000 cm 1 indicating the presence of flavonoids like catechin and quercetin among the peaks identified in the 2000 1000 cm 1 region are the sharp peaks at 1616 cm 1 c o stretch at 1366 cm 1 coh deformation and at 1136 1062 cm 1 coh stretch the presence of hydroxyl benzoic acid group is indicative by the presence of broad and prominent band at 3600 3300 cm 1 oh stretch a sharp peak at 1745 carbonyl c o stretch medium two peaks at 2924 and 2854 cm 1 alkyl ch stretch and a sharp peak at 1267 cm 1 co stretch the surface of egp thus has functional moieties belonging to polyphenolic constituent the spectrum of gpac reveals the loss of alkyl and carbonyl functionality fig 4a as indicative by the absence of peak at 2924 2854 and 1745 cm 1 selective peaks at 3431 cm 1 1577 cm 1 1393 cm 1 and 1124 cm 1 reveal the presence of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups in gpac thus appropriate activation conditions have helped in the transformation of a non porous egp having extensive polyphenolic functionality into a potential adsorbent in gpac having favourable characteristics like well developed porosity with a dominance of microporosity high surface area and selective surface binding sites cac on the other hand has a mesoporous surface morphology and the individual particles are nano sized 3 3 sand filtration pretreatment of www a series of pretretament steps standalone centrifugation standalone sand filtration and a combination of centrifugation and sand filtration were carried out to achieve maximum reduction of solids content in the www centrifugation alone brought about a reduction of 95 and 67 in turbidity and total solids respectively whereas sand filtration alone could achieve a reduction of 15 and 70 in the turbidity and total solids respectively a combination of centrifugation and sand filtration could achieve maximum reduction of turbidity and total solids as evident from table 3 but the same process failed to bring about significant reduction in the concentration of cod and tpp the results reveal a reduction of 96 8 in the turbidity and the total solids present in the www after the end of the filtration tests was 4 1 g l but the sand filtration did not bring about any significant effect on the removal of organic matter from www as the cod and tpp at the end of the cycle was 157 1 g l and 856 mg l respectively 3 4 batch adsorption studies 3 4 1 effect of ph an initial batch study was conducted to assess the performace of egp and gpac for the removal of tpp from the real wine wastewater www at a fixed adsorbent dosage of 8 g l and under fixed shaking time of 1 h the real www was diluted to achieve a tpp concentration of 43 6 mg l a simultaneous study was also made to assess the effect of ph on the polyphenols removal efficiency of the studied adsorbents it is a well known fact that ph can have a significant effect on the surface functionality of the adsorbent as well as on the phenolic constituents in www thereby it can have a tendency to affect the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent nayak et al 2017b also such studies can give an insight on the mechanism of binding of the tpp onto the adsorbent thus the ph of www was varied by appropriate addition of hno3 and naoh results of such study are depicted in fig 5 irrespective of the adsorbent highest tpp were removed at the natural ph of www 3 8 under similar experimental conditions at ph of 3 8 egp recorded a tpp removal efficiency of 48 56 while the same was recorded to the tune of 84 3 by gpac as compared to egp significant levels of porosity in gpac developed as a result of chemical activation could be the primary reason behind its higher tpp removal efficiency results further reveal that irrespective of the adsorbent type an acidic medium is more favourable for enhanced uptake of the tpp from www phenolic molecule is a water soluble weak acid dissociating into hydronium ion and a negatively charged phenoxide ion gupta et al 2014 as illustrated below 4 c6h5oh h2o c6h5o h3o this accounts for the acidic nature of www ph 3 8 under acidic medium both egp and gpac are protonated table 2 phpzc of egp and gpac determined was 4 5 and 7 0 respectively thereby both show a greater affinity to the slightly ionzed as well as molecular form of the phenolic constituents pka being 9 95 leading to higher uptake capacity for tpp from the www a similar observation was shown by al malack and dauda 2017 during the adsorption of phenol onto activated carbon developed from sewage sludge despite the well developed porosity of gpac the reduced uptake capacity for the tpp in alkaline medium ph 7 can be ascribed due a possible repulsion between the negatively charged phenoxide ion and the deprotonated gpac ph phpzc a similar observation of reduced tpp uptake at alkaline medium is observed for egp it is well known that under alkaline medium the phenolic constituents react to produce negatively charged phenoxide as per equation 5 5 c6h5oh oh c6h5o h2o fig 5 further reveals that for both adsorbents very little variation was observed in the ph of medium after adsorption phf thereby implying that the mechanism of binding is not related to charge neutralization thus although a possible electron donor acceptor reaction mechanism could have led to higher tpp adsorption from www at ph 3 8 for both egp and gpac yet the better adsorption performance of gpac could be attributed to its well developed porosity 3 4 2 kinetic studies fig 6 a reveals the results of the time dependent batch experiments conducted on real www at 25 c at a constant gpac dosage of 8 g l and at ph of 3 8 but at different tpp concentrations 50 856 mg l the figure shows that irrespective of the tpp concentration the rate of adsorption is very fast with equilibrium achieved within 2 h of contact within the first 30 mins of contact and with an increase in tpp concentration from 50 to 856 mg l the tpp adsorbed increased from 5 29 mg g 84 removal to 40 54 mg g 37 86 removal whereas within 2 h of contact and with a similar increase of tpp concentration the adsorption capacity of gpac increased from 6 02 mg g 95 removal to 44 31 mg g 41 38 removal a well distributed micropores and mesopores as exhibited by gpac could be responsible for its better efficiency to remove tpp from www higher tpp concentration in the www could have brought about a higher driving force for diffusion towards the gpac thereby initiating its higher uptake onto the adsorbent petruccioli et al 2000 gupta et al 2015 inorder to obtain a better insight on the mechanism of the diffusion and adsorption phenomenon the kinetic data were fitted to the pseudo 1st order pseudo 2nd order and the intra particle diffusion weber morris model the individual plots of pseudo 1st order log qe qt vs time ho and mckay 1999 pseudo 2nd order t qt vs time mckay and ho 1999 and intra particle diffusion qt vs t1 2 weber et al 1963 are shown in fig 6b c and 6d respectively the kinetic constants of the individual model parameters qe k1 k2 ki and r2 were determined from the individual rate expressions as given in table 4 they were further tabulated and compared so as to assess the best fitting model results show the better fitting of pseudo 1st order and pseudo 2nd order as evident from the high regression coefficient values r2 0 99 but the theoretically determined values of the adsorption capacity qe were found to be more closely similar to the experimentally assessed values for the pseudo 2nd order model over a wide range of studied concentration of tpp this reveals the applicability of the pseudo 2nd order model during the adsorption of tpp onto gpac while assessing the nature of diffusion via weber moris plot it is seen that there is an instantaneous and fast diffusion of the tpp towards the gpac as is evident from the initial steep slope fig 6d the steepness of the plot is seen to increase with increase in the tpp concentration and this implies that higher adsorbate concentration could have a caused a higher driving force to diffuse towards the gpac the rate transfer step is indicated from the second linear region of the plot while the third region signifies a saturation of the adsorption process both the second and third linear region of the plot do not pass through the origin thereby indicating an interplay of particle and film diffusion in the rate determining step of the adsorption process the value of intercept obtained from the plot table 4 depicts the resistance to mass transfer in the boundary layer with the increase in the tpp concentration it is evident that the intercept value is larger thereby implying the greater boundary layer effect inorder to further study the diffusion mechanism bangham model was applied to the experimental kinetics of the adsorption process of tpp onto gpac as per the equation given below 6 log log c o c o q t m log k o m 2 303 v α log t where co is initial concentration of tpp mg l v the volume of www ml m the weight of gpac used g l qt mg g is the amount of adsorbate retained at time t αand ko are constants the plots of log co co qtm values versus log t as shown in fig 7 are found to be linear thereby confirming that the diffusion of tpp is mediated by the extensive micropore and mesopore network in gpac serre and silcox 2000 3 4 3 batch isotherm studies the composition of the real www is complex having diverse nature of organic constituents besides the presence of polyphenols it is assumed that the presence of higher proportion of organic constituents in the real www especially in the form of carbohydrates ethanol fatty acids etc could interfere with the efficiency and or mechanism of binding of polyphenols onto the gpac inorder to better understand the adsorption phenomenon and to assess the binding mechanism isotherm studies were conducted on different adsorbate medium simulated and real www isotherm studies was also conducted under similar experimental conditions on cac for making a comparative assessment of the binding of tpp vis a vis gpac figs 8 and 9 depicts the results of batch experiments conducted on gpac and cac respectively under simulated and real www all maintained under similar conditions of fixed temperature of 25 c and ph of 3 8 while the tpp concentrations in simulated wastewater ranged from 50 to 1200 mg l the same in real www varied from 50 to 856 mg l the experiments were conducted at fixed dosage of gpac and cac 8 g l and the contact time was fixed at 2 h as can be seen from the figures irrespective of the nature of the adsorbents gpac and cac the amount of tpp adsorbed increased exponentially with the increase in the equilibrium concentration both adsorbents exhibited similar binding mechanism to the tpp irrespective of the adsorbate medium this is evident from the adsorption isotherm curves as well as from isotherm modeling studies fig 8a c and 9a c under simulated wastewater conditions the tpp have exhibited binding characteristics similar to that of a monolayer onto both gpac fig 8a and cac fig 9a under real www conditions the adsorption isotherms for gpac fig 8c and for cac fig 9c on the other hand indicates the interplay of both monolayer and multilayer adsorption weak adsorbent adsorbate interactions are evident in all conditions gupta et al 2011 with an aim to get a better insight into the adsorption isotherms the data were fitted to the langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 and the d r model dubinin et al 1947 details of which are given in tables 5 a and 5b the individual model parameters as well as their correlation coefficients were determined from the plots of langmuir 1 qe vs 1 ce freundlich log qe versus log ce and d r log qe vs log 1 1 ce tables 5a and 5b reveals the data thus obtained for adsorption of tpp onto gpac and cac respectively from the regression coefficient values r2 it is evident that for simulated wastewater having lower adsorbate concentrations the tpp adsorption onto both gpac and cac followed the langmuir model whereas at higher adsorbate concentrations the system followed the freundlich model on the other hand for the real www irrespective of the nature of the adsorbent both langmuir and freundlich model were applicable over the entire studied concentration range of tpp 50 856 mg l the langmuir model on the other hand was found to better correlate the experimental data at lower adsorbate concentrations thus under the hypothesis of the studied models adsorption of tpp from simulated wastewater onto both gpac and cac proceeded with the formation of a monolayer whereas multilayer adsorption was evident at higher adsorbate concentrations but in real www both monolayer and multilayer adsorption of tpp was evident at all the studied concentration range the nature of interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate was found to be weak irrespective of the wastewater conditions and irrespective of the adsorbent type this is evident from the very low b values tables 5a and 5b the maximum adsorption capacity qo of gpac and cac as determined from the langmuir model under real www was 28 4 mg g and 55 6 mg g respectively qo values for gpac and cac under simulated conditions as tabulated in tables 5a and 5b were 142 86 mg g and 1000 mg g respectively the phenol adsorption capacity by some adsorbents as reported in literature are rice husk activated carbon 0 002 mg g mahvi et al 2004 sargassummuticum 4 6 mg g rubın et al 2006 bagasse fly ash 8 3 mg g gupta et al 1998 wood fly ash 34 5 mg g daifullah and gad 1998 zncl2 pyrolysed oil shale 6 026 mg g al asheh et al 2004 although a comparitive study reveals the better performance of gpac for phenol removal from both simulated as well as real winery effluent yet it needs to be stated that the selective uptake of phenols by the different adsorbents reported in literature depend on the individual experimental conditions used i e ph temperature reaction time aqueous phase concentration nature of the phenolic constituents well as presence of co ions thus a judicial comparative assessment of the adsorption efficiency is not practical tables 5a and b further reveals a physisorption adsorption process as determined from d r model for both adsorbents gpac and cac under both simulated and real www bd 8 kj mol the higher efficiency of cac for tpp removal from both simulated as well as www conditions can possibly be attributed to its higher mesoporosity and its nano sized particles as compared to the predominantly microporous nature of gpac 3 4 4 effect of gpac dosage and its performance vis a vis cac the performance of gpac as an adsorbent was compared to that with cac under identical experimental conditions so as to assess its relative capacity to remove tpp from the undiluted real www the real www had an initial tpp of 856 mg l the experiments were performed with varying adsorbent dosage so as to simultaneously assess the role of the effect of varying adsorbent dosage on the quantity of tpp removed from www the results as shown in fig 10 reveal that within 2 h of contact and at an adsorbent dosage of 4 g l the removal of tpp was 28 by gpac whereas the same as shown by cac was 89 increase in the adsorbent dosage to 110 g l resulted in a 94 8 removal efficiency in gpac 7 38 mg g under similar conditions the removal efficiency of cac for tpp was 95 3 showing an adsorption capacity of 7 43 mg g thus significant amount of tpp 80 could be removed from www tpp concentration 856 mg l by the application of a higher dosage of gpac 32 g l the better performance of cac may be attributed to its mesoporosity as well as to its nano sized particle size as evident from figs 1c 2c and 3e f and table 2 3 5 recovery of tpp by batch desorption studies fig 11 reveals that the solvent used for desorption plays an important role in the effective recovery of tpp from the loaded gpac desorption experiments carried out on the loaded gpac under identical conditions reveal that maximum recovery of tpp 91 was achieved using 1 1 ethanol water mixed solvent the findings are in accordance to galanakis et al 2013a b 2015 who stated that the recovery of polyphenols is related to their solubility which is different in different solvents they claimed that the solubility of polyphenols is expected to be more in solvents with intermediate polarity instead of highly polar solvents like water or less polar ethyl acetate and acetone 4 conclusions grape pomace after the extraction of polyphenols can have the potential to be valorised for the sustainable and economic recovery of polyphenols tpp from www also polyphenols being toxic their prior removal is essential in effective operation of anaerobic digestion technique on www for the recovery of biogas as well as clean water the recovered polyphenols in turn can be used as food additives nutraceuticals and in cosmetics with this aim the present study was conducted and it shows the successful development of a porous activated carbon gpac via chemical activation with zncl2 from the exhausted grape pomace egp experiments conducted under similar conditions showed a greater recovery of tpp by gpac 84 3 from a real www diluted to give tpp concentration 43 6 mg l as compared to egp 48 5 the better performance of gpac as an adsorbent could be attributed to its heterogenous nature of porosity 60 9 micropores the process was found to be ph dependent with maximum uptake taking place in the original ph of www ph 3 8 kinetic studies reveal the operation of pseudo 2nd order and diffusion of tpp was mediated by the extensive micropore and mesopore network in gpac isotherm studies conducted on gpac and cac under both real and simulated conditions showed that the mechanism of binding of tpp was similar irrespective of adsorbent type and wastewater conditions the higher polyphenol adsorption capacity of cac from real www as determined from langmuir model 55 6 mg g as compared to that of gpac 28 4 mg g could be due to its predominant mesoporous characteristics as well as for its nano sized particles higher dosage of gpac 32 g l brought about significant and similar tpp removal 80 from www tpp concentration 856 mg l as compared to cac comparative literature study showed the better performance of gpac for phenols removal from both simulated as well as real www irrespective of the adsorbent and wastewater conditions the nature of the binding of polyphenols was physisorption as determined from both freundlich and d r model desorption solvent had a direct relation to the efficient recovery of polyphenols from the loaded gpac maximum recovery being achieved at 1 1 ethanol water solvent acknowledgements the authors are thankful to the european commission for financial support under the marie curie international

19342,removal of total polyphenols tpp is not only necessary as a pretreatment stepfor anaerobic digestion of wine wastewaters www but also the recovered polyphenols can be used as a dietary supplement with a view to make the process sustainable eco efficient and cost effective exhausted grape pomace egp after the extraction of polyphenols was impregnated with zncl2 1 1 5 and further activated at 450 c for 1 h under inert atmosphere the gpac grape pomace activated carbon thus developed exhibited well developed porosity with a predominance of micropores high surface area and selective surface binding sites batch adsorption conducted on diluted www revealed the better performance of gpac 84 3 removal as compared to egp 48 5 removal under similar conditions with maximum adsorption taking place at ph 3 8 while ph studies indicated a possible electron donor acceptor mechanism in the binding of tpp kinetic studies indicated that diffusion was mediated by the porosity in gpac isotherm studies conducted on gpac and commercial carbon cac revealed multilayer binding under www while langmuir model was operative under simulated conditions contrary to the better performance of cac the same for gpac was comparable at higher dosage where 80 tpp was removed from undiluted www the phenol adsorption capacity of gpac from real 28 4 mg g and from simulated wastewater 142 6 mg g was higher as compared to other reported adsorbents desorption of tpp from loaded gpac was maximum 91 with 1 1 ethanol water solvent the results reveal a sustainable eco friendly solution for valorisation of exhausted grape pomace for recovery of polyphenols from wine wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords exhausted grape pomace chemical activation polyphenols recovery wine wastewater adsorption valorisation 1 introduction winery wastewater www is classified as a biodegradable agro industrial effluent containing predominantly soluble organic wastes and which constitutes a major source of environmental pollution andreottola et al 2009 sheridan et al 2011 strong 2008 the discharge of such wastewater to water bodies is associated with major risks to the environment associated with eutrophication death of aquatic life etc this is because of the high organic load and the significant presence of total polyphenols tpp in the www quayle et al 2009 while the monocyclic phenolic components present in the www are responsible for phytotoxicity and antibacterial effects the more recalcitrant polymeric phenols impart the characteristic undesirable color to such wastewater torrijos and moletta 1997 on the other hand the high organic load and the favourable cod n p chemical oxygen demand nitrogen phosphorus ratio can be better utilised in the treatment of www via anaerobic digestion ad which in turn can achieve both goals of its decontamination and valorisation of the organic fraction by means of methane production moletta 2005 nayak et al 2017a ros et al 2016 ruíz et al 2002 however the polyphenols present in www are known to induce inhibitory effect on the microbial activity and can induce undesired effects on the biological treatment process such as decrease in the rate of elimination and or longer treatment times rosenkranz et al 2013 the negative effect of polyphenol degradation can be physiological via inhibition of metabolism as well as can be structurally linked to modification of community composition removal of polyphenols is thus not only an essential step for the pretreatment of www prior to the ad technique but also the recovered polyphenols can be used as food additives nutraceuticals and in cosmetics arnous et al 2001 galanakis et al 2018a b c lafka et al 2007 saura calixto 1998 antioxidants as present in natural phenolic compounds in grape pomace are known to contribute to the health benefits through various mechanisms like quenching of free radicals chelating transition metals reducing peroxides and stimulating antioxidative enzyme defense jayaprakasha et al 2003 negro et al 2003 among the various techniques that have been adopted to remove recover the less biodegradable organic compounds like polyphenols from wastewaters adsorption has been cited as a powerful environmental friendly technology gupta et al 2014 ioannou et al 2014 but the high cost of the commercial activated carbon as well as the non environmental friendly measures adopted for its regeneration reuse is a major deterrent to its widespread use in wastewater treatment bansal and goyal 2005 dabrowski 2001 also the saturated activated carbon is itself a solid waste and its unsafe disposal practices impose further sustainability issues in this respect organic based lignocellulosic waste by products from agricultural and forest residues have proved to be cheaper and sustainable alternatives for the synthesis of quality activated carbons and their subsequent use for wastewater treatment gupta et al 2015 nayak et al 2017b review articles published in 2005 dabrowski et al 2005 and in 2008 ahmaruzzaman 2008 have summarised the successful separation of phenolic compounds from wastewaters by the use of commercial activated carbons biosorbents and non conventional activated carbons prepared from a wide range of precursors ranging from natural industrial lignocellulosic based agricultural forest residues biomass etc in this respect grape pomace gp due to its large scale generation in the mediterranean region as well as its favourable lignocellulosic based characteristics could serve as a potential low cost substrate for the preparation of quality adsorbent and its subsequent use in water treatment studies reveal that gp is a source of dietary fiber and antioxidants from which polyphenols have been extracted nayak et al 2018 but its use as an efficient biosorbent has also been reported for the separation of cr vi chand et al 2009 and mycotoxin from aqueous suspension avantaggiato et al 2014 activated carbons developed via thermal methods from gp has also demonstrated to be a low cost adsorbent for separation of heavy metals from wastewater nayak et al 2016 deiana et al 2014 sardella et al 2015 but till date no such studies have been reported on the use of gp as a precursor for activated carbon biosorbent for the removal recovery of polyphenolic compounds from wastewaters chemical activation has been successfully applied on various low cost widely available precursors for the development of activated carbons considering its many advantages vis à vis thermal methods and the fact that such has not been applied earlier on gp the present study thus has a focus in preparing chemicallyactivated carbon gpac from exhausted gp after extraction of polyphenols for the removal and recovery of polyphenols from a real winery effluent the reason for selection of exhausted gp as a precursor for the development of gpac was to maximise the valorisation efficiency of gp zncl2 impregnated exhausted gp was appropriately activated under inert atmosphere and the developed gpac was assessed for its physico chemical characteristics and to correlate its structural characteristics with its adsorptive performance the adosrption efficiency of gpac was studied onto real www collected from an experimental winery the www revealed the presence of solids besides the high organic content for which a series of pretreatment methods were carried out prior to the application of the adsorption technique the kinetic studies were conducted in batch mode and experimentally optimised to maximise the removal of polyphenols from the pretreated www isotherm studies were conducted on real winery effluent as well as on simulated water so as to study the behaviour of the gpac under different wastewater conditions the performance of gpac was also monitored vis a vis a commercial activated carbon cac thus attempt was made in the present study not only to access the adsorptive nature of the gpac for the separation of polyphenols from a real winery effluent but also the mechanism of the binding process was extensively evaluated on both real and simulated wastewater conditions desorption studies helped to recover the adsorbed polyphenols from gpac by optimising the solvent types 2 materials and methods 2 1 cac gp and www samples commercial activated carbon cac was purchased from sigma aldrich pressed grape pomace gp and wine wastewater www samples were collected after the red vinification from the experimental winery mas friars the centre linked to the faculty of oenology of universitat rovirai virgilli urv at tarragona spain the wastewater was stored at 4 c for further experimental activity to avoid any biochemical reactions simulated wastewater having varying gallic acid concentration 50 1200 mg l was prepared in the laboratory to assess the performance of gpac under both simulated and real www conditions and also to make a comparative assessment of the binding mechanism the pressed pomace was received having a moisture content of 76 the gp samples were oven dried in a conventional oven maintained at 100 5 c for 24 h at atmospheric pressure dried gp samples were milled in a food processing grinder and finally stored in polythene bags polyphenols were recovered using conventional solvent solid extraction as well as via ultrasonication assisted techniques from gp nayak et al 2018 the study revealed that the exhausted grape pomace egp was organic in nature having a rich mixture of dietary fiber protein sugars and a low mineralogical content 2 2 development of gpac approximately 250 g of the oven dried exhausted grape pomace egp after extraction of polyphenols was impregnated with zncl2 solution having a concentration of 750 g l the impregnation ratio maintained was 1 1 5 the mixing was performed at 80 c for 3 h in a magnetic stirrer the slurry thus obtained was oven dried at 100 c for 24 h the product was further activated to 450 c for 1 h under continuous n2 gas flow 100 ml min in a stainless steel fixed bed tubular reactor equipped with an automatic control system flow pressure temperature the sample after cooling was soaked with 0 5 n hcl solutions for 24 h to remove adhering chemicals and ashes the sample was washed repeatedly with hot distilled water and finally with cold distilled water until the ph of the wash water was neutral the sample was dried in an oven at 110 c for 24 h the sample designated as gpac after grinding and sieving to a particle size of 150 200 μm was stored in separate plastic containers until required 2 3 physico chemical analysis of egp gpac and cac the surface area characteristics with respect to bet surface area sbet micropore surface area

tristar 3000 nayak et al 2017b the surface texture and morphology of the samples were examined using jeoljsm7100f scanning electron microscope sem before the scanning process all samples were dried and coated with gold under vacuum in a jfc 1600 sputter coater jeol japan for 20 min to enhance the electron conductivity the sem micrographs were henceforth taken at different magnifications the methodology as outlined in an earlier study nayak et al 2017b was adopted for the determination of surface acidity basicity and phpzc of the samples besides the functional moieties on the surface of the samples was determined from the infrared spectra as recorded in a infrared spectrophotometer perkin elmer usa small quantity of each sample was mixed with kbr crystals at a ratio of 1 mg sample 100 mg kbr and then grinded to produce a very fine powder the powder was then placed in a stainless steel die and compressed to produce a disc the formed disc was then placed in the ftir instrument and scanned intransmission mode through wave number range from 4000 to 400 cm 1 before each measurement the instrument was run to collect the background which was then automatically subtracted from the sample spectra 2 4 chemical analysis of www ph studies were conducted on a ph meter model cyberscan510 singapore total solids ts volatile solids vs total suspended solids tss were determined as per standard methods apha 1998 the cod was determined by digestion of the water samples in a cod digester at 150 c for 2 h followed by photometric determination hannah instruments soluble cod was determined in a similar method after vacuum filtration through 0 45 μm filters the organic content of www was determined by a certified commercial laboratory analiza barcelona the tpp total polyphenols of www were determined spectrophotometrically with a uv vis spectrophotometer perkin elmer model lambda 35 at 760 nm using the folin test slinkard and singleton 1977 gallic acid served as the standard for preparing calibration curve ranging from 5 to 200 mg l assay solution all measurements were conducted in triplicate and the average value was interpolated in a standard gallic acid calibration curve total polyphenol content of the sample was expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalents per liter of wastewater mg gae l 2 5 pretreatment of www the high solids content in www required an initial pretreatment a low cost energy efficient slow filtration method using a packed bed column with sand was used the setup is shown in fig s1 the slow sand filtration technique is known to efficiently remove turbidity suspended solids toxic metals as well as pathogens in untreated or treated water verma et al 2017 sand filtration was performed in batch mode in a gravity column under downward flow diameter of column 4 cm the sand selected for the study had the following characteristics sea sand washed thin grain sio2 mol wt 60 09 g l thin grain particle size 0 25 0 30 mm soluble matter in hcl 0 2 loss on drying 0 2 chloride 0 015 the www was centrifuged for 15 min at 4000 rpm and the initial feed of the centrifuged www into the column was 1 l the feeding was made by a peristaltic pump the bed height maintained was 10 cm a low filtration rate maintained was 0 1 l min and a total of 5 cycles was continued till a constant cod and turbidity was attained turbidity and cod was measured before and after each filtration stage in order to define a filtration protocol as a pre treatment for the adsorption process 2 6 batch adsorption tests the adsorption tests were conducted in batch mode in which a fixed adsorbent dosage was contacted in 250 ml of www the experimental conditions maintained were at a fixed temperature and ph while the batch tests were conducted taking varying concentrations of www at fixed contact time during isotherm studies the same was conducted at fixed www concentrations under different contact times during kinetic studies in all experiments the adsorbent adsorbate system was agitated in a temperature controlled water bath shaker at 100 rpm the concentration of total polyphenols tpp of wastewaters initial and final was determined spectrophotometrically with a uv vis spectrophotometer perkin elmer model lambda 35 at 760 nm using the folin test slinkard and singleton 1977 all the experiments were assessed in triplicate and average values were reported blank runs with only the adsorbents were conducted simultaneously under similar conditions and corrections made wherever necessary the adsorption uptake qe mg g was calculated as 1 qe co ce v w 2 removal co ce co 100 where co and ce are the initial and final tpp concentrations mg l respectively v is the volume of solution l and w is the weight of adsorbent g 2 7 batch desorption tests immediately after the adsorption step desorption step was carried out to assess the recovery efficiency of the tpp from the loaded gpac into the liquid phase adsorption experiments were conducted as described in sec 2 6 in 250 ml of the real wine wastewater www having a tpp concentration of 856 mg l and agitated with 8 g l gpac for 2 h in a water bath shaker the loaded gpac recovered after filtration was contacted with 250 ml of the desorbing solvent and the system was agitated for 2 h in the water bath shaker at 100 rpm maintained at 25 c the type of solvent has an important effect on the desorption of polyphenols from the adsorbent matrix hence desorption experiments were carried out using different solvents separately i e distilled water ethanol water mixtre of 3 1 1 1 1 3 100 ethanol and ethyl acetate the liquid phase after filtration was analysed for tpp spectrophotometrically as outlined in sec 2 6 the desorption was calculated as

adsorbed during the adsorption experiments 3 results 3 1 www characterisation as evident from table 1 the www had a high cod of 182 45 g l and an acidic ph of 3 8 reflecting the presence of significant amount of organic matter soluble to total cod of 93 indicates that majority of organic substances in the www are biodegradable and may hence be valorised via anaerobic digestion ad techniques to produce biofuels nayak et al 2017a significant proportions of carbohydrates 20 36 ethanol 7 5 fatty acids and polyphenols are contributory to the high cod of the www the presence of a high solid content of the www ts 127 g l and tds 7 g l reveals the requirement of its pretreatment also due to the significant presence of the tpp in the www 856 mg l and considering its toxicity to the microbial community the present study was focussed in a pretreatment of www to reduce the high solids content b development and characterisation of gpac from exhausted gp c assessment of gpac as adsorbent for removal recovery of tpp from www d and finally assessment and comparision of the mechanism of binding of tpp onto gpac and cac under different wastewater conditions simulated and real www 3 2 surface characterisation of gpac and egp selection of appropriate operating conditions during the chemical impregnation and subsequent activation can bring about significant changes in the physico chemical characteristics of the activated carbon and which can ultimately influence the efficiency of its performace as an adsorbent based on the preliminary results obtained gpac was prepared in this study under zncl2 impregnation of the exhausted grape pomace ratio of impregnation 1 1 5 and further activated at a lower temperature of 450 c under inert atmosphere for 1 h preliminary trials revealed the better performance of the activated carbon prepared from egp with zncl2 impregnation having an impregnation ratio of 1 1 5 comparision of the surface textural results table 2 as determined from n2 adsorption desorption isotherms fig 1 a b 1c revealed a higher bet surface area of 764 2 m2 g and 565 7 m2 g in gpac and cac respectively the corresponding micropore area of gpac and cac were 538 3 m2 g and 333 m2 g the egp on the other hand demonstrated a non porous surface morphology fig 1a shows increased adsorption of n2 occurring on the surface of gpac at low relative pressures followed by a nearly horizontal plateau at higher relative pressures thereby reflecting the presence and dominance of microporosity in gpac a small hysteresis loop is observed which is associated with capillary condensation inside mesopores indicating the presence of mesopores the isotherm fig 1c in cac although similar to that in fig 1a but indicates the dominance of mesoporosity as evident from the hysteresis loop the corresponding isotherms fig 1b as obtained from egp sample represent the absence of porosity infinite adsorption is observed at relative pressures p po approaching 1 and this indicates the presence of a uniform surface and multilayer adsorption of n2 in egp fig 2 a showing the porosity and pore size distribution as determined from the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms confirmed the predominance of micropores in gpac which was to the tune of 60 9 of the total pores as can be seen in table 2 the total pore volume determined was 0 33 cc g with an average pore width of 17 3 å the microporosity in cac fig 2c determined was 41 confirming the dominance of mesoporosity the average pore width calculated was 31 8 å as is evident from fig 2b the egp sample has a wider pore size distribution with a significant proportion of pores in the diameter range greater than 500 å the average pore width determined was 252 6 å the surface morphology as can be seen from the fe sem images of the surface of gpac fig 3 a reveals the presence of nearly similar sized particles having an average size of 100 μm the images taken at a higher magnification of 25kx fig 3b and 50kx fig 3c of individual particles of gpac show the presence of well defined pores with micro and nano sizes fig 3d showing the image of egp at a magnification of 10kx reveals the absence of porosity in the particles the average particle size recorded was 100 μm fig not shown the image of cac fig 3e on the other hand reveals the presence of irregularly sized particles with an average particle size of 10 μm higher magnification at 50kx fig 3f reveals the agglomerates of smaller particles having an average dimension of 100 nm as a result of activation the carbon content showed a significant increase from 34 7 in egp to 86 1 in gpac table 2 the oxygen and hydrogen content of the gpac were within the range recommended for a typical activated carbon bansal and goyal 2005 the ftir spectra of egp fig 4 b reveals a broad and strong peak at 3600 3100 cm 1 and variable peaks at 2000 1000 cm 1 indicating the presence of flavonoids like catechin and quercetin among the peaks identified in the 2000 1000 cm 1 region are the sharp peaks at 1616 cm 1 c o stretch at 1366 cm 1 coh deformation and at 1136 1062 cm 1 coh stretch the presence of hydroxyl benzoic acid group is indicative by the presence of broad and prominent band at 3600 3300 cm 1 oh stretch a sharp peak at 1745 carbonyl c o stretch medium two peaks at 2924 and 2854 cm 1 alkyl ch stretch and a sharp peak at 1267 cm 1 co stretch the surface of egp thus has functional moieties belonging to polyphenolic constituent the spectrum of gpac reveals the loss of alkyl and carbonyl functionality fig 4a as indicative by the absence of peak at 2924 2854 and 1745 cm 1 selective peaks at 3431 cm 1 1577 cm 1 1393 cm 1 and 1124 cm 1 reveal the presence of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups in gpac thus appropriate activation conditions have helped in the transformation of a non porous egp having extensive polyphenolic functionality into a potential adsorbent in gpac having favourable characteristics like well developed porosity with a dominance of microporosity high surface area and selective surface binding sites cac on the other hand has a mesoporous surface morphology and the individual particles are nano sized 3 3 sand filtration pretreatment of www a series of pretretament steps standalone centrifugation standalone sand filtration and a combination of centrifugation and sand filtration were carried out to achieve maximum reduction of solids content in the www centrifugation alone brought about a reduction of 95 and 67 in turbidity and total solids respectively whereas sand filtration alone could achieve a reduction of 15 and 70 in the turbidity and total solids respectively a combination of centrifugation and sand filtration could achieve maximum reduction of turbidity and total solids as evident from table 3 but the same process failed to bring about significant reduction in the concentration of cod and tpp the results reveal a reduction of 96 8 in the turbidity and the total solids present in the www after the end of the filtration tests was 4 1 g l but the sand filtration did not bring about any significant effect on the removal of organic matter from www as the cod and tpp at the end of the cycle was 157 1 g l and 856 mg l respectively 3 4 batch adsorption studies 3 4 1 effect of ph an initial batch study was conducted to assess the performace of egp and gpac for the removal of tpp from the real wine wastewater www at a fixed adsorbent dosage of 8 g l and under fixed shaking time of 1 h the real www was diluted to achieve a tpp concentration of 43 6 mg l a simultaneous study was also made to assess the effect of ph on the polyphenols removal efficiency of the studied adsorbents it is a well known fact that ph can have a significant effect on the surface functionality of the adsorbent as well as on the phenolic constituents in www thereby it can have a tendency to affect the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent nayak et al 2017b also such studies can give an insight on the mechanism of binding of the tpp onto the adsorbent thus the ph of www was varied by appropriate addition of hno3 and naoh results of such study are depicted in fig 5 irrespective of the adsorbent highest tpp were removed at the natural ph of www 3 8 under similar experimental conditions at ph of 3 8 egp recorded a tpp removal efficiency of 48 56 while the same was recorded to the tune of 84 3 by gpac as compared to egp significant levels of porosity in gpac developed as a result of chemical activation could be the primary reason behind its higher tpp removal efficiency results further reveal that irrespective of the adsorbent type an acidic medium is more favourable for enhanced uptake of the tpp from www phenolic molecule is a water soluble weak acid dissociating into hydronium ion and a negatively charged phenoxide ion gupta et al 2014 as illustrated below 4 c6h5oh h2o c6h5o h3o this accounts for the acidic nature of www ph 3 8 under acidic medium both egp and gpac are protonated table 2 phpzc of egp and gpac determined was 4 5 and 7 0 respectively thereby both show a greater affinity to the slightly ionzed as well as molecular form of the phenolic constituents pka being 9 95 leading to higher uptake capacity for tpp from the www a similar observation was shown by al malack and dauda 2017 during the adsorption of phenol onto activated carbon developed from sewage sludge despite the well developed porosity of gpac the reduced uptake capacity for the tpp in alkaline medium ph 7 can be ascribed due a possible repulsion between the negatively charged phenoxide ion and the deprotonated gpac ph phpzc a similar observation of reduced tpp uptake at alkaline medium is observed for egp it is well known that under alkaline medium the phenolic constituents react to produce negatively charged phenoxide as per equation 5 5 c6h5oh oh c6h5o h2o fig 5 further reveals that for both adsorbents very little variation was observed in the ph of medium after adsorption phf thereby implying that the mechanism of binding is not related to charge neutralization thus although a possible electron donor acceptor reaction mechanism could have led to higher tpp adsorption from www at ph 3 8 for both egp and gpac yet the better adsorption performance of gpac could be attributed to its well developed porosity 3 4 2 kinetic studies fig 6 a reveals the results of the time dependent batch experiments conducted on real www at 25 c at a constant gpac dosage of 8 g l and at ph of 3 8 but at different tpp concentrations 50 856 mg l the figure shows that irrespective of the tpp concentration the rate of adsorption is very fast with equilibrium achieved within 2 h of contact within the first 30 mins of contact and with an increase in tpp concentration from 50 to 856 mg l the tpp adsorbed increased from 5 29 mg g 84 removal to 40 54 mg g 37 86 removal whereas within 2 h of contact and with a similar increase of tpp concentration the adsorption capacity of gpac increased from 6 02 mg g 95 removal to 44 31 mg g 41 38 removal a well distributed micropores and mesopores as exhibited by gpac could be responsible for its better efficiency to remove tpp from www higher tpp concentration in the www could have brought about a higher driving force for diffusion towards the gpac thereby initiating its higher uptake onto the adsorbent petruccioli et al 2000 gupta et al 2015 inorder to obtain a better insight on the mechanism of the diffusion and adsorption phenomenon the kinetic data were fitted to the pseudo 1st order pseudo 2nd order and the intra particle diffusion weber morris model the individual plots of pseudo 1st order log qe qt vs time ho and mckay 1999 pseudo 2nd order t qt vs time mckay and ho 1999 and intra particle diffusion qt vs t1 2 weber et al 1963 are shown in fig 6b c and 6d respectively the kinetic constants of the individual model parameters qe k1 k2 ki and r2 were determined from the individual rate expressions as given in table 4 they were further tabulated and compared so as to assess the best fitting model results show the better fitting of pseudo 1st order and pseudo 2nd order as evident from the high regression coefficient values r2 0 99 but the theoretically determined values of the adsorption capacity qe were found to be more closely similar to the experimentally assessed values for the pseudo 2nd order model over a wide range of studied concentration of tpp this reveals the applicability of the pseudo 2nd order model during the adsorption of tpp onto gpac while assessing the nature of diffusion via weber moris plot it is seen that there is an instantaneous and fast diffusion of the tpp towards the gpac as is evident from the initial steep slope fig 6d the steepness of the plot is seen to increase with increase in the tpp concentration and this implies that higher adsorbate concentration could have a caused a higher driving force to diffuse towards the gpac the rate transfer step is indicated from the second linear region of the plot while the third region signifies a saturation of the adsorption process both the second and third linear region of the plot do not pass through the origin thereby indicating an interplay of particle and film diffusion in the rate determining step of the adsorption process the value of intercept obtained from the plot table 4 depicts the resistance to mass transfer in the boundary layer with the increase in the tpp concentration it is evident that the intercept value is larger thereby implying the greater boundary layer effect inorder to further study the diffusion mechanism bangham model was applied to the experimental kinetics of the adsorption process of tpp onto gpac as per the equation given below 6 log log c o c o q t m log k o m 2 303 v α log t where co is initial concentration of tpp mg l v the volume of www ml m the weight of gpac used g l qt mg g is the amount of adsorbate retained at time t αand ko are constants the plots of log co co qtm values versus log t as shown in fig 7 are found to be linear thereby confirming that the diffusion of tpp is mediated by the extensive micropore and mesopore network in gpac serre and silcox 2000 3 4 3 batch isotherm studies the composition of the real www is complex having diverse nature of organic constituents besides the presence of polyphenols it is assumed that the presence of higher proportion of organic constituents in the real www especially in the form of carbohydrates ethanol fatty acids etc could interfere with the efficiency and or mechanism of binding of polyphenols onto the gpac inorder to better understand the adsorption phenomenon and to assess the binding mechanism isotherm studies were conducted on different adsorbate medium simulated and real www isotherm studies was also conducted under similar experimental conditions on cac for making a comparative assessment of the binding of tpp vis a vis gpac figs 8 and 9 depicts the results of batch experiments conducted on gpac and cac respectively under simulated and real www all maintained under similar conditions of fixed temperature of 25 c and ph of 3 8 while the tpp concentrations in simulated wastewater ranged from 50 to 1200 mg l the same in real www varied from 50 to 856 mg l the experiments were conducted at fixed dosage of gpac and cac 8 g l and the contact time was fixed at 2 h as can be seen from the figures irrespective of the nature of the adsorbents gpac and cac the amount of tpp adsorbed increased exponentially with the increase in the equilibrium concentration both adsorbents exhibited similar binding mechanism to the tpp irrespective of the adsorbate medium this is evident from the adsorption isotherm curves as well as from isotherm modeling studies fig 8a c and 9a c under simulated wastewater conditions the tpp have exhibited binding characteristics similar to that of a monolayer onto both gpac fig 8a and cac fig 9a under real www conditions the adsorption isotherms for gpac fig 8c and for cac fig 9c on the other hand indicates the interplay of both monolayer and multilayer adsorption weak adsorbent adsorbate interactions are evident in all conditions gupta et al 2011 with an aim to get a better insight into the adsorption isotherms the data were fitted to the langmuir 1918 freundlich 1906 and the d r model dubinin et al 1947 details of which are given in tables 5 a and 5b the individual model parameters as well as their correlation coefficients were determined from the plots of langmuir 1 qe vs 1 ce freundlich log qe versus log ce and d r log qe vs log 1 1 ce tables 5a and 5b reveals the data thus obtained for adsorption of tpp onto gpac and cac respectively from the regression coefficient values r2 it is evident that for simulated wastewater having lower adsorbate concentrations the tpp adsorption onto both gpac and cac followed the langmuir model whereas at higher adsorbate concentrations the system followed the freundlich model on the other hand for the real www irrespective of the nature of the adsorbent both langmuir and freundlich model were applicable over the entire studied concentration range of tpp 50 856 mg l the langmuir model on the other hand was found to better correlate the experimental data at lower adsorbate concentrations thus under the hypothesis of the studied models adsorption of tpp from simulated wastewater onto both gpac and cac proceeded with the formation of a monolayer whereas multilayer adsorption was evident at higher adsorbate concentrations but in real www both monolayer and multilayer adsorption of tpp was evident at all the studied concentration range the nature of interaction between the adsorbent and adsorbate was found to be weak irrespective of the wastewater conditions and irrespective of the adsorbent type this is evident from the very low b values tables 5a and 5b the maximum adsorption capacity qo of gpac and cac as determined from the langmuir model under real www was 28 4 mg g and 55 6 mg g respectively qo values for gpac and cac under simulated conditions as tabulated in tables 5a and 5b were 142 86 mg g and 1000 mg g respectively the phenol adsorption capacity by some adsorbents as reported in literature are rice husk activated carbon 0 002 mg g mahvi et al 2004 sargassummuticum 4 6 mg g rubın et al 2006 bagasse fly ash 8 3 mg g gupta et al 1998 wood fly ash 34 5 mg g daifullah and gad 1998 zncl2 pyrolysed oil shale 6 026 mg g al asheh et al 2004 although a comparitive study reveals the better performance of gpac for phenol removal from both simulated as well as real winery effluent yet it needs to be stated that the selective uptake of phenols by the different adsorbents reported in literature depend on the individual experimental conditions used i e ph temperature reaction time aqueous phase concentration nature of the phenolic constituents well as presence of co ions thus a judicial comparative assessment of the adsorption efficiency is not practical tables 5a and b further reveals a physisorption adsorption process as determined from d r model for both adsorbents gpac and cac under both simulated and real www bd 8 kj mol the higher efficiency of cac for tpp removal from both simulated as well as www conditions can possibly be attributed to its higher mesoporosity and its nano sized particles as compared to the predominantly microporous nature of gpac 3 4 4 effect of gpac dosage and its performance vis a vis cac the performance of gpac as an adsorbent was compared to that with cac under identical experimental conditions so as to assess its relative capacity to remove tpp from the undiluted real www the real www had an initial tpp of 856 mg l the experiments were performed with varying adsorbent dosage so as to simultaneously assess the role of the effect of varying adsorbent dosage on the quantity of tpp removed from www the results as shown in fig 10 reveal that within 2 h of contact and at an adsorbent dosage of 4 g l the removal of tpp was 28 by gpac whereas the same as shown by cac was 89 increase in the adsorbent dosage to 110 g l resulted in a 94 8 removal efficiency in gpac 7 38 mg g under similar conditions the removal efficiency of cac for tpp was 95 3 showing an adsorption capacity of 7 43 mg g thus significant amount of tpp 80 could be removed from www tpp concentration 856 mg l by the application of a higher dosage of gpac 32 g l the better performance of cac may be attributed to its mesoporosity as well as to its nano sized particle size as evident from figs 1c 2c and 3e f and table 2 3 5 recovery of tpp by batch desorption studies fig 11 reveals that the solvent used for desorption plays an important role in the effective recovery of tpp from the loaded gpac desorption experiments carried out on the loaded gpac under identical conditions reveal that maximum recovery of tpp 91 was achieved using 1 1 ethanol water mixed solvent the findings are in accordance to galanakis et al 2013a b 2015 who stated that the recovery of polyphenols is related to their solubility which is different in different solvents they claimed that the solubility of polyphenols is expected to be more in solvents with intermediate polarity instead of highly polar solvents like water or less polar ethyl acetate and acetone 4 conclusions grape pomace after the extraction of polyphenols can have the potential to be valorised for the sustainable and economic recovery of polyphenols tpp from www also polyphenols being toxic their prior removal is essential in effective operation of anaerobic digestion technique on www for the recovery of biogas as well as clean water the recovered polyphenols in turn can be used as food additives nutraceuticals and in cosmetics with this aim the present study was conducted and it shows the successful development of a porous activated carbon gpac via chemical activation with zncl2 from the exhausted grape pomace egp experiments conducted under similar conditions showed a greater recovery of tpp by gpac 84 3 from a real www diluted to give tpp concentration 43 6 mg l as compared to egp 48 5 the better performance of gpac as an adsorbent could be attributed to its heterogenous nature of porosity 60 9 micropores the process was found to be ph dependent with maximum uptake taking place in the original ph of www ph 3 8 kinetic studies reveal the operation of pseudo 2nd order and diffusion of tpp was mediated by the extensive micropore and mesopore network in gpac isotherm studies conducted on gpac and cac under both real and simulated conditions showed that the mechanism of binding of tpp was similar irrespective of adsorbent type and wastewater conditions the higher polyphenol adsorption capacity of cac from real www as determined from langmuir model 55 6 mg g as compared to that of gpac 28 4 mg g could be due to its predominant mesoporous characteristics as well as for its nano sized particles higher dosage of gpac 32 g l brought about significant and similar tpp removal 80 from www tpp concentration 856 mg l as compared to cac comparative literature study showed the better performance of gpac for phenols removal from both simulated as well as real www irrespective of the adsorbent and wastewater conditions the nature of the binding of polyphenols was physisorption as determined from both freundlich and d r model desorption solvent had a direct relation to the efficient recovery of polyphenols from the loaded gpac maximum recovery being achieved at 1 1 ethanol water solvent acknowledgements the authors are thankful to the european commission for financial support under the marie curie international

19343,considerable efforts have been made in recent years in developing novel marker genes for fecal pollution tracking in environmental waters crassphage are recently discovered dna bacteriophage that are highly abundant in human feces and untreated sewage in this study we evaluated the host sensitivity and specificity of the newly designed crassphage qpcr assays stachler et al 2017 cpq 056 and cpq 064 i e marker genes in fecal samples collected from various human and several animal host groups in australia we also investigated the utility of these marker genes to detect sewage pollution in an urban recreational lake i e lake parramatta in sydney nsw the mean concentrations of cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in untreated sewage were 9 43 0 14 log10 gc l and 8 91 0 17 log10 gc l respectively 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than other sewage associated viruses used in microbial source tracking studies among 177 animal fecal samples tested from 11 species the host specificity values for cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes were 0 95 and 0 93 respectively limited cross reactivity was observed with cat fecal and cattle wastewater samples abundance of crassphage markers were monitored in an urban lake that receives stormwater runoff the concentrations of both markers were higher cpq 056 ranging from 3 40 to 6 04 log10 gc l and cpq 064 ranging from 2 90 to 5 47 log10 gc l in 20 of 20 for cpq 056 and 18 of 20 for cpq 064 samples collected after storm events with gauged sewer overflows compared to dry weather event 10 of 10 samples were qpcr negative for the cpq 056 and 8 of 10 were negative for the cpq 064 marker genes suggesting sewage pollution was transported by urban stormwater runoff to lake parramatta the results of the study may provide context for management of sewage pollution from gauged overflow points of the sewerage system in the catchment keywords microbial source tracking crassphage marker gene sewage contamination runoff stormwater 1 introduction population growth and urbanization result in sewage contamination of catchment waters from sewer overflows defective septic systems clogged lift stations and broken sewer pipes schneeberger et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 sewage contamination not only affects environmental but also human health due to exposure to pathogens that can cause adverse health outcomes campos et al 2017 furthermore animal wastewater from farms he et al 2016 and defecation from wild animals ahmed et al 2016a are contributing to fecal pollution loads in environmental waters fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli and enterococcus spp are found in the intestines of warm blooded animals including humans feachem et al 1983 the presence of fib in water suggests fecal contamination of water and potential health risks however the inability of fib to distinguish between human and other animal sources of fecal pollution led to the development of microbial source tracking mst tools mst tools can differentiate between sources of fecal pollution by using alternative fecal indicators and associated marker genes a range of quantitative pcr qpcr assays has been developed to quantify human and animal marker genes in environmental waters see reviews by harwood et al 2014 ahmed et al 2016b the value of a marker gene for mst field studies depends on several performance characteristics including host sensitivity host specificity even distribution in fecal samples decay kinetics similar to the target pathogens and a positive correlation with pathogens among these performance characteristics host sensitivity and host specificity are the two most important factors to date none of the mst markers in the research literature has exhibited absolute host specificity except human adenoviruses hadv and human polyomaviruses hpyv ahmed et al 2010 harwood et al 2009 however a drawback of these two markers is the concentrations tend to be low in untreated sewage because their occurrence especially adenovirus depends on illness rates in the community an ideal sewage marker i e highly host specific and sensitive is yet to be discovered ahmed et al 2016b a novel bacteriophage crassphage was reported to be present in most published human fecal metagenomes dutilh et al 2014 this newly discovered phage was predicted to be a bacteroides phage by co occurrence profiling in a subsequent study crassphage was found to be highly abundant in sewage and biosolids in the usa and europe and less abundant in sewage from asia and africa stachler and bibby 2014 the crassphage was not detected in animal fecal samples except for bat guano leading to the conclusion that a crassphage based mst marker may be suitable for sewage pollution tracking in environmental studies stachler and bibby 2014 consequently in 2017 the same authors developed crassphage assays by designing 284 primer sets along the length of the meta consensus crassphage genome from these primer sets two novel crassphage qpcr assays cpq 056 and cpq 064 were developed and evaluated for the quantitative detection of sewage pollution in water both assays exhibited high host specificity 98 6 when tested against a panel of a large number of animal fecal samples and were highly abundant in untreated sewage and sewage impacted water stachler et al 2017 a recent study also developed a crassphage qpcr assay different to the assays developed by stachler et al 2017 for sewage pollution tracking in environmental waters in spain garcia aljaro et al 2017 the crassphage marker was found to be highly prevalent in untreated wastewater i e 5 40 6 90 log10 gene copies gc ml but was also detected in 61 pig n 15 cattle n 12 and poultry n 14 slurry samples with an average concentration 3 7 log10 gc ml of slurry another recent study developed a real time pcr assay to monitor the epidemiology of crassphage in human diseases liang et al 2018 the specificity of the assay was tested against 40 gut microbes with no pcr amplification suggesting a high specificity of the assay however the host specificity of crassphage was not determined for animal fecal samples as the objective of the study was to provide information on the prevalence of crassphage in the human intestine the primary objective of this study was to determine the host sensitivity and specificity of the newly designed crassphage qpcr assays cpq 056 and cpq 064 i e marker genes in fecal samples collected from various human and animal host groups in australia in addition environmental water samples were collected from a lake i e lake parramatta that receives urban stormwater runoff and wet weather overflows wwos and tested for the presence of both crassphage marker genes the occurrence of the crassphage marker genes was used to provide evidence of sewage pollution in the lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 human and animal reference fecal samples to determine the host sensitivity of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes reference dna samples extracted from untreated sewage samples were used from a previous study ahmed et al 2015a twelve composite untreated sewage samples representing human hosts were collected from the influent of three sewage treatment plants stps from brisbane perth and tasmania in this study fresh human fecal samples n 12 were collected from healthy individuals to determine the host specificity a panel of 177 fresh animal reference fecal dna samples were also used from a previous study ahmed et al 2016a human and animal reference fecal sampling details and how the samples were processed have been described in detail previously ahmed et al 2015b 2016a 2 2 lake parramatta sampling lake parramatta is a freshwater lake located in sydney nsw currently used for recreational activities such as swimming boating and water sports fig 1 the size of lake parramatta is approximately 10 5 ha with a designated swimming enclosure swimming in lake parramatta was officially reintroduced in january 2015 thousands of people visit the lake for recreational activities during summer the swimming season usually commences in october while there is no restriction on swimming it is recommended that people do not swim in the lake for three days following heavy rainfall due to possible water quality degradation five sampling sites lp1 lp2 lp02a lp3 and lp5 were chosen from lake parramatta among the five sampling sites only lp02a is located within the designated swimming enclosure for all five sampling sites samples were collected at two depths i 0 5 m below the water surface and ii 1 m above the bottom of the lake water samples were collected from all sites during two storm events with gauged sewer overflows 27 2 2018 and 14 3 2018 and one dry weather event 19 4 2018 yielding a total of 30 water samples for this study a storm weather event was represented by a minimum of 10 mm of precipitation in the preceding 24 h the dry weather event is represented by no precipitation for at least 72 h prior to sampling to understand when sewage discharges occur to the lake parramatta catchment level sensors with telemetry were placed at four designated overflow points all four overflow points entered the catchment above the upper most lake sampling site of lp5 the lowest of the four overflows discharged on 25 02 2018 for 18 h and 35 min and on 26 02 2018 for 50 min while around midnight on 13 03 2018 an overflow of 40 min duration was also recorded hence in this study wet weather events were a mixture of urban stormwater and diluted sewage a 5 l sample was collected from each occasion using a sterile plastic container samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and processed within 6 h after collection 2 3 processing of lake parramatta water samples the ph in all water samples was adjusted to 3 5 using 2 0 n hcl and approximately 500 ml 1 l of each sample was filtered through negatively charged 47 mm or 90 mm 0 45 μm ha membranes millipore to capture both bacteria and viruses in case of membrane clogging due to turbidity multiple membranes were used the membranes were inserted into 15 ml tubes and stored at 80 c for 4 weeks in sydney water s laboratory until dna extraction for crassphage marker genes analysis the membranes were shipped on dry ice to the csiro laboratory at the ecosciences precinct dutton park brisbane qld 2

experiment was conducted to determine the potential presence of pcr inhibitors in fecal and environmental dna samples using a sketa22 real time pcr assay haugland et al 2005 human animal fecal samples and environmental water samples with a 2 cq delay were considered to have potential pcr inhibitors samples with pcr inhibitors were subjected to a 10 fold dilution with te buffer undiluted i e pcr uninhibited and 10 fold diluted i e pcr inhibited samples were used for qpcr analysis of crassphage marker genes all dna samples were stored at 80 c and subjected to qpcr analysis within seven days after dna extraction 2 5 qpcr assays previously published qpcr assays were used for the analysis of the crassphage marker genes stachler et al 2017 the primers and probes for cpq 056 and cpq 064 assays are shown in table 1 along with qpcr cycling parameters for cpq 056 assay a synthetic dna fragment in a plasmid cloning vector containing a 132 bp qpcr target was purchased from integrated dna technologies idtdna com coralville ia a qpcr standard was prepared from the synthetic dna ranging from 106 to 1 gc μl of dna for cpq 064 a gblocks gene fragment was also purchased from idt qpcr

volume of wastewater that can be reliably detected and quantified respectively after the sample is subjected to filtration dna extraction and qpcr analysis plod and ploq were determined by seeding 3 ml of untreated sewage into 297 ml of the filtered beach water sample 1 99 ratio in triplicates hughes et al 2017 tenfold serial dilutions 10 1 to 10 6 were made for all seeded samples the ph of each sample was adjusted to 3 5 with 2 0 n hcl before being filtered through negatively charged 47 mm 0 45 μm ha membranes dna samples were extracted from the membranes using mo bio powerwater dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa 2 8 quality control a method blank was used to ensure that no carryover contamination occurred between sampling events in addition a reagent blank was included for each batch of dna samples to ensure no carryover contamination occurred from dna extraction reagents no carryover contamination was observed in method or reagent blank samples to minimize qpcr contamination dna extraction and qpcr setup were performed in separate laboratories 2 9 data analysis the host sensitivity and specificity values of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes were

cpq 064 samples were considered quantifiable when the crassphage marker gene levels were above the qpcr aloq samples that were below the aloq level and generated pcr amplification were considered as positive but not quantifiable for statistical analysis cpq 056 and cpq 064 concentrations were log10 transformed pearson product moment correlation was used for linear regression between the cpq 056 and cpq 064 concentrations in lake parramatta water samples for correlation and regression analyses the marker gene concentrations were assumed to be one half of the alod when they were not detected farnham et al 2002 weidhaas et al 2011 3 results 3 1 cpq 056 and cpq 064 assays performance characteristics qpcr standard curves n 6 were analysed in order to determine the reaction efficiencies the standards had a linear range of quantification from 3 106 to 3 100 gc reaction table 2 the slope of the standards ranged from 3 412 to 3 154 for cpq 056 and 3 441 to 3 092 for cpq 064 the

aloq values of cpq 056 and cpq 064 assays were determined using the standards the qpcr alod was determined to be 3 gc reaction for both assays and aloq was determined to be 30 gc reaction for both assays the plod and ploq values smallest amount of wastewater that can be detected or quantified of cpq 056 and cpq 064 in serially diluted filtered beach water samples seeded with raw wastewater are shown in table 3 plod and ploq values of cpq 056 were 3 and 30 nl respectively cpq 064 marker gene was less sensitive than cpq 056 samples were positive when 30 nl raw sewage was present and quantifiable when 300 nl untreated sewage was present see table 3 3 3 pcr inhibition untreated sewage and fecal samples did not have pcr inhibitors several samples collected in wet weather periods showed signs of pcr inhibition 10 fold serial dilution relieved pcr inhibition among the 30 lake parramatta water samples tested 14 samples had pcr inhibitors of these 12 samples were collected after the storm events and two samples were collected preceding dry weather 3 4 host sensitivity and specificity all 12 100 untreated sewage samples were positive for both cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes among the 13 individual human fecal samples tested 6 46 1 were positive for both markers see table 4 the host sensitivity value for both marker genes was 1 for untreated sewage samples maximum value of 1 whereas host sensitivity values for both marker genes were 0 46 for human fecal samples the overall host sensitivity of both marker genes was 0 72 among the 177 animal fecal dna samples tested only 8 5 08 and 12 6 77 samples were positive for cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes respectively cat n 6 cpq 056 and n 10 cpq 064 and cattle wastewater n 2 for both cpq 056 and cpq 064 dna samples

events 1 and 2 20 100 and 18 90 samples were positive for the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes respectively in contrast among the 10 samples collected during the dry weather event 2 20 were positive for each of cpq 056 sites lp02a and lp3 and cpq 064 sites lp1 and lp02a the concentration of cpq 056 marker gene in quantifiable water samples at a depth 0 5 m ranged from 3 40 to 5 73 log10 gc l of water table 5 these concentrations are equivalent to 0 93 199 μl of untreated sewage l of lake parramatta water similarly the concentration of cpq 064 marker gene in water samples at a depth 0 5 m ranged from 2 90 to 5 07 log10 gc l of water table 6 these concentrations are equivalent to 0 97 144 μl of untreated sewage l of lake water the concentration of cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in quantifiable water samples at a depth 1 m above the bottom ranged from 3 57 to 6 04 and 2 99 to 5 47 log10 gc l of water respectively these concentrations are equivalent to 1 37 μl to 406 μl and 1 20 μl 363 μl of untreated sewage l of water respectively the concentrations of cpq 056 marker gene were greater in sites lp02a lp3 and lp5 storm events 1 and 2 and lp1 and lp2 storm event 2 at a depth 1 m above the bottom compared to 0 5 m below the water surface similarly the concentrations of cpq 064 marker gene were greater in sites lp1 lp02a lp3 and lp5 storm events 1 and 2 and lp2 storm event 2 at a depth 1 m compared to 0 5 m between the two storm events the concentrations of cpq 056 and cpq 064 were higher in samples collected after storm event 1 compared to storm event 2 except sites lp1 and lp2 at a 1 m depth where the concentrations of these markers were similar in both storm events or slightly higher in event 2 compared to event 1 we determined the agreement between cpq 056 and cpq 064 markers in lake parramatta water samples during the course of the study in all 86 6 samples had either co occurrence i e both marker genes were present in 63 3 water samples or absence i e both marker genes were absent in 23 3 water samples a significant p 0 0001 correlation was observed between cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in lake parramatta water samples over the course of the study fig 3 4 discussion viruses are the ideal candidate for mst field studies because they can exhibit greater host specificity than bacteria ahmed et al 2010 however one of the major limitations is that their concentrations can be low in human and other animal feces making them difficult to detect in diluted environmental water samples ahmed et al 2015b crassphage is the most abundant known bacteriophage presumed to infect bacteroidetes in the human intestine which was discovered in 2014 in 2017 stachler and colleagues developed two qpcr assays cpq 056 and cpq 064 targeting crassphage marker genes associated with human feces and sewage these marker genes were reported to be highly prevalent in sewage and sewage contaminated water and specific to untreated sewage in the usa in this study we validated the performance characteristics of crassphage marker genes in human and animal fecal samples collected from australia we also investigated the utility of crassphage marker genes to detect sewage pollution in a recreational lake in sydney nsw the mean concentration of cpq 056 marker gene in untreated sewage was remarkably high 9 43 0 14 log10 gc l furthermore their distributions in three stps located in three geographical locations brisbane perth and tasmania were similar with no apparent variability in concentrations the mean concentrations of cpq 056 reported in this study was similar to a recent study that determined the concentration of cpq 056 range 9 08 9 98 log10 gc l in untreated sewage in subtropical tampa florida ahmed et al 2018a the mean concentration of cpq 064 was 8 91 0 17 log10 gc l marginally lower than the cpq 056 however to the best of our knowledge no other studies to date have determined the concentrations of cpq 064 in per l untreated sewage therefore data obtained in this study cannot yet be compared stachler et al 2017 who originally developed cpq 056 and cpq 064 assays reported their concentrations ng of dna extracted from 10 ml of untreated sewage since we measured the concentrations of untreated dna samples we were able to calculate concentrations of cpq 056 and cpq 064 and they were within the same order of magnitude as reported by stachler et al 2017 another study reported high concentrations of crassphage with values ranging from 5 4 to 6 9 log10 gc ml and an average value of 6 24 log10 gc ml in spain garcia aljaro et al 2017 based on a separate qpcr assay which was not evaluated in the current study the spanish study identified crassphage sequence variation in sewage and found a conserved region of 78 bp fragment which was subsequently chosen to develop a qpcr assay for the quantification of crassphage overall results from this study along with studies from usa and spain suggest a greater prevalence of crassphage in urban stps in three continents the reported concentrations of crassphage in research literature are 2 3 orders of magnitude greater than most commonly used viral markers such as adenovirus polyomavirus and pepper mild mottle viruses ahmed et al 2015a hughes et al 2017 hundesa et al 2010 symonds et al 2016 wolf et al 2010 among the human fecal samples tested in this study 46 1 were positive for both cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes the mean log10 concentrations of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes g of human feces were one order of magnitude lower than l of untreated sewage similar results have been reported for humm2 bach and hf183 bacterial sewage associated markers in a bacteroidales validation study where the concentrations of those markers ng of dna were greater in untreated sewage compared to human feces odagiri et al 2015 as with other enteric viruses such as rotavirus and astrovirus berthiaume et al 1981 clumping or aggregation of crassphage in the feces may affect their detection using qpcr a recent study determined the occurrence of crassphage in 255 human fecal samples from patients with diarrhea in china among the 255 samples 49 19 6 were real time pcr positive for the crassphage similarly cinek et al 2017 also reported highly variable concentrations of crassphage in 20 7 24 of 274 fecal samples collected from children from azerbaijan finland jordan nigeria and sudan the reason for an uneven distribution of crassphage in human feces is not well understood and requires further investigation crassphage presence has been reported to be correlated to consumption of a low carbohydrate high protein diet and it is possible that diet affects their prevalence in the human gut furthermore factors such as host age and health may also influence the stability of a marker gene shanks et al 2008 such as crassphage within a population little is known regarding the host specificity of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 crassphage marker genes since none of the markers currently used for mst studies are absolute host specific 100 host specificity we determined the host specificity of the crassphage marker genes by testing fecal samples from 11 species of animals commonly found in australia this is quite important because erroneously identified implicated sources will result in continued exposure risk and the potential for wasted capital investment for mitigation activities such as upgrading sewer infrastructure kinzelman and ahmed 2014 the host specificity values of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in reference dna samples for animal hosts were 0 95 and 0 93 respectively currently there is no benchmark for a host specificity measure of a marker the closer the value to 1 the better the marker is a specificity value 0 80 is considered reasonable and 0 90 is excellent boehm et al 2013 us epa 2005 the original study that developed the cpq 056 and cpq 046 assays reported high host specificity of these markers for animal fecal samples in the usa stachler et al 2017 the host specificity value of one of the crassphage markers i e cpq 056 was further determined in dna samples isolated from animal host groups in tampa florida and found to be 0 92 ahmed et al 2018b high host specificity values reported for cpq 056 and cpq 064 so far are promising and suggesting the suitability of these markers to identify sewage contamination in environmental waters we must make a cautionary statement that the host specificity values reported in this study are based on the animal reference fecal dna samples tested in this study addition of more fecal dna samples or species to the existing reference dna samples may alter the host specificity values in this study both crassphage markers were detected in cattle wastewater and cat fecal samples previous studies also detected cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in animal fecal samples such as two seagulls one dog and poultry litter samples in most cases the concentrations of these marker in animal fecal samples were 4 5 orders of magnitude lower than untreated sewage this may not be an issue as low levels of crassphage marker genes in animal fecal samples may be difficult to detect in environmental water samples due to percent recovery and dilution factors the concentrations of both crassphage markers in cat fecal samples were relatively greater than in cattle wastewater their presence in cat fecal and cattle wastewater samples is unclear and would require further investigation it is possible that some genome regions of crassphage may have homology to other animal associated phages while some regions may be human specific stachler et al 2018 it is also possible that crassphage in cat feces and cattle wastewater are transient population factors such as different primer sets assay conditions geographical region and types of fecal materials may influence host specificity of any given mst marker gene ahmed et al 2018a the second objective of the study was to undertake a field study to determine the application of the crassphage marker genes to identify sewage pollution in environmental waters the field study focused on an urban lake which receives urban stormwater runoff and wwos sydney has an average annual rainfall of 1200 mm which primarily falls between october and may in high intensity storms urban stormwater runoff and wwos to receiving waterways are a significant issue harris 2014 samples collected during storm events 1 and 2 were pcr positive for both crassphage markers in contrast samples collected from dry weather event were mostly below the alod except a couple of samples were positive for the cpq 064 marker gene water samples collected after the storm event 1 had greater abundance of cpq 056 and cpq 064 compared to storm event 2 this could be due to the fact that one of the sensors gauged at four overflow points triggered for approximately 19 h 25 min prior to sampling event 1 indicating more sewage overflowed into lake water compared to sampling event 2 when the same gauged overflow point triggered only for 40 min good agreement was also found for both markers which suggests urban stormwater runoff and wwos containing sewage contribute to the presence of these markers in lake parramatta a recent study also reported a strong correlation between cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in an urban stream impacted by combined sewer overflows stachler et al 2018 the concentrations of both markers at several sampling sites were greater at a depth 1 m above the bottom compared to 0 5 m below the water surface suggesting better persistence of these markers in deep lake water elevated concentrations in deep lake water could be attributed to decreasing uva and uvb wavelength intensity at a greater depth mattioli et al 2017 korajkic et al 2014 reported that exposure to ambient sunlight and biotic interactions are important factors in the decay of sewage borne fib as well as sewage associated marker genes the water samples collected from the lake were turbid and therefore we can hypothesize that turbidity may have reduced light penetration and as a result crassphage marker genes probably decayed slower at the greater depth than the surface water the levels of sewage pollution i e marker genes detected at several sites were high similar levels of sewage pollution have been reported in other studies in the urban environments originating from sewage contaminated stormwater sauer et al 2011 sercu et al 2011 steele et al 2018 van de werfhorst et al 2014 samples collected from the designated swimming enclosure were also positive for both marker genes supporting the recommendation that swimming in the lake immediately after rainfall may pose an increased health risks to swimmers our results are in accordance with the recommendation that people should not swim in the most lakes and rivers in nsw for at least 3 days after heavy rainfall this recommendation however is based on monitoring fecal indicator bacteria the decay of fib in sewage contaminated water may be faster than enteric viruses ahmed et al 2014 therefore a comparative decay of mst markers along with fib and perhaps reference pathogens such as norovirus or adenovirus 40 41 should be undertaken to provide more insight into potential health risks and to determine when it would be safe to swim based on the results of this study we can conclude that sewage pollution is present in lake water samples following storm events and wwos however it is also important to determine whether the levels of crassphage marker genes detected in lake parramatta water samples pose any health risks to swimmers the levels of markers that would potentially pose a health risk have been estimated for the hf183 using different qmra approaches boehm et al 2013 ahmed et al 2018b according to the qmra estimates a level 3 50 log10 gc 100 ml ahmed et al 2018a and 3 62 log10 gc 100 ml boehm et al 2015 of hf183 marker gene will exceed a risk benchmark of 36 1000 and 32 1000 people the qmra models used by boehm et al 2015 and ahmed et al 2018b can be further improved by incorporating pathogens decay recovery and transport models a similar model can also be developed for crassphage marker genes currently the qmra analysis is hindered by lack of pathogen and marker concentration data in sewage the ratio of sewage associated markers and reference pathogens such as norovirus and adenovirus 40 41 needs to be established in untreated and treated sewage samples in a longitudinal survey for at least one year currently limited data are available on the concentrations of mst markers and enteric viruses in australian sewage more data when available will allow us to determine the risk associated with enteric viruses using sewage associated markers 5 conclusions both crassphage marker genes cpq 056 and cpq 064 are highly specific to human and abundant in untreated wastewater their high concentrations and less variability in untreated wastewater highlight their suitability for tracking sewage pollution in water since both markers showed cross reactivity with cat fecal and cattle wastewater samples it is recommended that both markers should be used simultaneously if possible along with an additional sewage associated i e such as hf183 or adenovirus markers in mst field studies to obtain confirmatory results the high abundance of both markers in lake water samples collected after storm events compared to low prevalence in dry weather event suggests sewage pollution is occurring in the lake and urban stormwater runoff is the likely contributing factor transporting this pollution from gauged overflow point of the sewerage system in the catchment further research would be required to understand the decay kinetics of crassphage markers in environmental waters in relation to fib and pathogens furthermore qmra analysis also needs to be undertaken to establish what levels of markers would pose a human health risk to swimmers or other recreational water users acknowledgments we thank sydney water for financial assistance and for support in collection of water samples and

19343,considerable efforts have been made in recent years in developing novel marker genes for fecal pollution tracking in environmental waters crassphage are recently discovered dna bacteriophage that are highly abundant in human feces and untreated sewage in this study we evaluated the host sensitivity and specificity of the newly designed crassphage qpcr assays stachler et al 2017 cpq 056 and cpq 064 i e marker genes in fecal samples collected from various human and several animal host groups in australia we also investigated the utility of these marker genes to detect sewage pollution in an urban recreational lake i e lake parramatta in sydney nsw the mean concentrations of cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in untreated sewage were 9 43 0 14 log10 gc l and 8 91 0 17 log10 gc l respectively 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than other sewage associated viruses used in microbial source tracking studies among 177 animal fecal samples tested from 11 species the host specificity values for cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes were 0 95 and 0 93 respectively limited cross reactivity was observed with cat fecal and cattle wastewater samples abundance of crassphage markers were monitored in an urban lake that receives stormwater runoff the concentrations of both markers were higher cpq 056 ranging from 3 40 to 6 04 log10 gc l and cpq 064 ranging from 2 90 to 5 47 log10 gc l in 20 of 20 for cpq 056 and 18 of 20 for cpq 064 samples collected after storm events with gauged sewer overflows compared to dry weather event 10 of 10 samples were qpcr negative for the cpq 056 and 8 of 10 were negative for the cpq 064 marker genes suggesting sewage pollution was transported by urban stormwater runoff to lake parramatta the results of the study may provide context for management of sewage pollution from gauged overflow points of the sewerage system in the catchment keywords microbial source tracking crassphage marker gene sewage contamination runoff stormwater 1 introduction population growth and urbanization result in sewage contamination of catchment waters from sewer overflows defective septic systems clogged lift stations and broken sewer pipes schneeberger et al 2014 zhu et al 2018 sewage contamination not only affects environmental but also human health due to exposure to pathogens that can cause adverse health outcomes campos et al 2017 furthermore animal wastewater from farms he et al 2016 and defecation from wild animals ahmed et al 2016a are contributing to fecal pollution loads in environmental waters fecal indicator bacteria fib such as escherichia coli e coli and enterococcus spp are found in the intestines of warm blooded animals including humans feachem et al 1983 the presence of fib in water suggests fecal contamination of water and potential health risks however the inability of fib to distinguish between human and other animal sources of fecal pollution led to the development of microbial source tracking mst tools mst tools can differentiate between sources of fecal pollution by using alternative fecal indicators and associated marker genes a range of quantitative pcr qpcr assays has been developed to quantify human and animal marker genes in environmental waters see reviews by harwood et al 2014 ahmed et al 2016b the value of a marker gene for mst field studies depends on several performance characteristics including host sensitivity host specificity even distribution in fecal samples decay kinetics similar to the target pathogens and a positive correlation with pathogens among these performance characteristics host sensitivity and host specificity are the two most important factors to date none of the mst markers in the research literature has exhibited absolute host specificity except human adenoviruses hadv and human polyomaviruses hpyv ahmed et al 2010 harwood et al 2009 however a drawback of these two markers is the concentrations tend to be low in untreated sewage because their occurrence especially adenovirus depends on illness rates in the community an ideal sewage marker i e highly host specific and sensitive is yet to be discovered ahmed et al 2016b a novel bacteriophage crassphage was reported to be present in most published human fecal metagenomes dutilh et al 2014 this newly discovered phage was predicted to be a bacteroides phage by co occurrence profiling in a subsequent study crassphage was found to be highly abundant in sewage and biosolids in the usa and europe and less abundant in sewage from asia and africa stachler and bibby 2014 the crassphage was not detected in animal fecal samples except for bat guano leading to the conclusion that a crassphage based mst marker may be suitable for sewage pollution tracking in environmental studies stachler and bibby 2014 consequently in 2017 the same authors developed crassphage assays by designing 284 primer sets along the length of the meta consensus crassphage genome from these primer sets two novel crassphage qpcr assays cpq 056 and cpq 064 were developed and evaluated for the quantitative detection of sewage pollution in water both assays exhibited high host specificity 98 6 when tested against a panel of a large number of animal fecal samples and were highly abundant in untreated sewage and sewage impacted water stachler et al 2017 a recent study also developed a crassphage qpcr assay different to the assays developed by stachler et al 2017 for sewage pollution tracking in environmental waters in spain garcia aljaro et al 2017 the crassphage marker was found to be highly prevalent in untreated wastewater i e 5 40 6 90 log10 gene copies gc ml but was also detected in 61 pig n 15 cattle n 12 and poultry n 14 slurry samples with an average concentration 3 7 log10 gc ml of slurry another recent study developed a real time pcr assay to monitor the epidemiology of crassphage in human diseases liang et al 2018 the specificity of the assay was tested against 40 gut microbes with no pcr amplification suggesting a high specificity of the assay however the host specificity of crassphage was not determined for animal fecal samples as the objective of the study was to provide information on the prevalence of crassphage in the human intestine the primary objective of this study was to determine the host sensitivity and specificity of the newly designed crassphage qpcr assays cpq 056 and cpq 064 i e marker genes in fecal samples collected from various human and animal host groups in australia in addition environmental water samples were collected from a lake i e lake parramatta that receives urban stormwater runoff and wet weather overflows wwos and tested for the presence of both crassphage marker genes the occurrence of the crassphage marker genes was used to provide evidence of sewage pollution in the lake 2 materials and methods 2 1 human and animal reference fecal samples to determine the host sensitivity of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes reference dna samples extracted from untreated sewage samples were used from a previous study ahmed et al 2015a twelve composite untreated sewage samples representing human hosts were collected from the influent of three sewage treatment plants stps from brisbane perth and tasmania in this study fresh human fecal samples n 12 were collected from healthy individuals to determine the host specificity a panel of 177 fresh animal reference fecal dna samples were also used from a previous study ahmed et al 2016a human and animal reference fecal sampling details and how the samples were processed have been described in detail previously ahmed et al 2015b 2016a 2 2 lake parramatta sampling lake parramatta is a freshwater lake located in sydney nsw currently used for recreational activities such as swimming boating and water sports fig 1 the size of lake parramatta is approximately 10 5 ha with a designated swimming enclosure swimming in lake parramatta was officially reintroduced in january 2015 thousands of people visit the lake for recreational activities during summer the swimming season usually commences in october while there is no restriction on swimming it is recommended that people do not swim in the lake for three days following heavy rainfall due to possible water quality degradation five sampling sites lp1 lp2 lp02a lp3 and lp5 were chosen from lake parramatta among the five sampling sites only lp02a is located within the designated swimming enclosure for all five sampling sites samples were collected at two depths i 0 5 m below the water surface and ii 1 m above the bottom of the lake water samples were collected from all sites during two storm events with gauged sewer overflows 27 2 2018 and 14 3 2018 and one dry weather event 19 4 2018 yielding a total of 30 water samples for this study a storm weather event was represented by a minimum of 10 mm of precipitation in the preceding 24 h the dry weather event is represented by no precipitation for at least 72 h prior to sampling to understand when sewage discharges occur to the lake parramatta catchment level sensors with telemetry were placed at four designated overflow points all four overflow points entered the catchment above the upper most lake sampling site of lp5 the lowest of the four overflows discharged on 25 02 2018 for 18 h and 35 min and on 26 02 2018 for 50 min while around midnight on 13 03 2018 an overflow of 40 min duration was also recorded hence in this study wet weather events were a mixture of urban stormwater and diluted sewage a 5 l sample was collected from each occasion using a sterile plastic container samples were transported to the laboratory on ice and processed within 6 h after collection 2 3 processing of lake parramatta water samples the ph in all water samples was adjusted to 3 5 using 2 0 n hcl and approximately 500 ml 1 l of each sample was filtered through negatively charged 47 mm or 90 mm 0 45 μm ha membranes millipore to capture both bacteria and viruses in case of membrane clogging due to turbidity multiple membranes were used the membranes were inserted into 15 ml tubes and stored at 80 c for 4 weeks in sydney water s laboratory until dna extraction for crassphage marker genes analysis the membranes were shipped on dry ice to the csiro laboratory at the ecosciences precinct dutton park brisbane qld 2 4 dna extraction and pcr inhibition testing dna was extracted from an aliquot of 250 μl of untreated sewage sample using the mo bio powersoil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca with minor modifications gyawali et al 2015 dna was extracted from 100 to 220 mg of each fresh human and other animal fecal sample using qiaamp stool dna kit qiagen valencia california usa dna samples were extracted from the membranes using the dneasy power water kit qiagen valencia ca dna concentrations were measured with a spectrophotometer nanodrop nd 1000 thermo scientific willmington de usa an experiment was conducted to determine the potential presence of pcr inhibitors in fecal and environmental dna samples using a sketa22 real time pcr assay haugland et al 2005 human animal fecal samples and environmental water samples with a 2 cq delay were considered to have potential pcr inhibitors samples with pcr inhibitors were subjected to a 10 fold dilution with te buffer undiluted i e pcr uninhibited and 10 fold diluted i e pcr inhibited samples were used for qpcr analysis of crassphage marker genes all dna samples were stored at 80 c and subjected to qpcr analysis within seven days after dna extraction 2 5 qpcr assays previously published qpcr assays were used for the analysis of the crassphage marker genes stachler et al 2017 the primers and probes for cpq 056 and cpq 064 assays are shown in table 1 along with qpcr cycling parameters for cpq 056 assay a synthetic dna fragment in a plasmid cloning vector containing a 132 bp qpcr target was purchased from integrated dna technologies idtdna com coralville ia a qpcr standard was prepared from the synthetic dna ranging from 106 to 1 gc μl of dna for cpq 064 a gblocks gene fragment was also purchased from idt qpcr standard 106 to 1 gc μl of dna were prepared from the gblocks as per specification sheet information both cpq 056 and cpq 064 qpcr amplifications were performed in 20 μl reaction mixtures using ssoadvanced universal probes supermix bio rad laboratories richmond ca both qpcr mixtures contained 10 μl of supermix 900 nm of forward primer 900 nm of reverse primer 100 nm probe for cpq 056 300 nm probe for cpq 064 and 3 μl of template dna the qpcr assays were performed using a bio rad cfx96 thermal cycler all qpcr reactions were performed in triplicate for each qpcr run a series of standards 3 106 to 3 gc reaction and no template controls n 3 were included 2 6 qpcr performance characteristics qpcr standards were analysed to determine the amplification efficiencies e and the correlation coefficient r 2 the reproducibility of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 qpcr assays was assessed by determining inter assay reproducibility inter assay variability was measured using four separate qpcr assays performed on four different days using three replicates of the standard ranging from 3 106 3 101 gc reaction 2 7 limit of detection and quantification the qpcr assay s lower limit of detection alod and quantification aloq values were determined from cq values of the multiple standards run the process limit of detection plod and process limit of quantification ploq were determined as the smallest volume of wastewater that can be reliably detected and quantified respectively after the sample is subjected to filtration dna extraction and qpcr analysis plod and ploq were determined by seeding 3 ml of untreated sewage into 297 ml of the filtered beach water sample 1 99 ratio in triplicates hughes et al 2017 tenfold serial dilutions 10 1 to 10 6 were made for all seeded samples the ph of each sample was adjusted to 3 5 with 2 0 n hcl before being filtered through negatively charged 47 mm 0 45 μm ha membranes dna samples were extracted from the membranes using mo bio powerwater dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories carlsbad ca usa 2 8 quality control a method blank was used to ensure that no carryover contamination occurred between sampling events in addition a reagent blank was included for each batch of dna samples to ensure no carryover contamination occurred from dna extraction reagents no carryover contamination was observed in method or reagent blank samples to minimize qpcr contamination dna extraction and qpcr setup were performed in separate laboratories 2 9 data analysis the host sensitivity and specificity values of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes were determined as follows host sensitivity a a b and specificity c c d where a is true positive human fecal and untreated sewage samples were positive for the crassphage marker gene b is false negative human fecal samples were negative for the crassphage marker gene c is true negative animal fecal samples were negative for the marker gene and d is false positive animal fecal samples were positive for the marker gene the combined host specificity values of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes were also determined as follows combined host specificity 1 1 specificity of cpq 056 1 specificity of cpq 064 samples were considered quantifiable when the crassphage marker gene levels were above the qpcr aloq samples that were below the aloq level and generated pcr amplification were considered as positive but not quantifiable for statistical analysis cpq 056 and cpq 064 concentrations were log10 transformed pearson product moment correlation was used for linear regression between the cpq 056 and cpq 064 concentrations in lake parramatta water samples for correlation and regression analyses the marker gene concentrations were assumed to be one half of the alod when they were not detected farnham et al 2002 weidhaas et al 2011 3 results 3 1 cpq 056 and cpq 064 assays performance characteristics qpcr standard curves n 6 were analysed in order to determine the reaction efficiencies the standards had a linear range of quantification from 3 106 to 3 100 gc reaction table 2 the slope of the standards ranged from 3 412 to 3 154 for cpq 056 and 3 441 to 3 092 for cpq 064 the amplification efficiencies ranged from 96 5 to 107 cpq 056 and 95 3 to 110 cpq 064 the correlation coefficient r 2 ranged from 0 973 to 0 999 cpq 056 and 0 948 to 0 999 cpq 064 the mean coefficient of variation cv values across four sets of standards ranging from 3 106 3 101 gc reaction were 5 51 for cpq 056 and 1 34 for cpq 064 3 2 cpq 056 and cpq 064 limit of detection and quantification alod and aloq values of cpq 056 and cpq 064 assays were determined using the standards the qpcr alod was determined to be 3 gc reaction for both assays and aloq was determined to be 30 gc reaction for both assays the plod and ploq values smallest amount of wastewater that can be detected or quantified of cpq 056 and cpq 064 in serially diluted filtered beach water samples seeded with raw wastewater are shown in table 3 plod and ploq values of cpq 056 were 3 and 30 nl respectively cpq 064 marker gene was less sensitive than cpq 056 samples were positive when 30 nl raw sewage was present and quantifiable when 300 nl untreated sewage was present see table 3 3 3 pcr inhibition untreated sewage and fecal samples did not have pcr inhibitors several samples collected in wet weather periods

the storm events and two samples were collected preceding dry weather 3 4 host sensitivity and specificity all 12 100 untreated sewage samples were positive for both cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes among the 13 individual human fecal samples tested 6 46 1 were positive for both markers see table 4 the host sensitivity value for both marker genes was 1 for untreated sewage samples maximum value of 1 whereas host sensitivity values for both marker genes were 0 46 for human fecal samples the overall host sensitivity of both marker genes was 0 72 among the 177 animal fecal dna samples tested only 8 5 08 and 12 6 77 samples were positive for cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes respectively cat n 6 cpq 056 and n 10 cpq 064 and cattle wastewater n 2 for both cpq 056 and cpq 064 dna samples

marker in untreated sewage was 9 43 0 14 log10 gc l greater than cpq 064 marker gene i e 8 91 0 17 log10 gc l fig 2 similarly the mean log10 concentration of the cpq 056 marker in human feces was 8 10 0 17 log10 gc g compared to cpq 064 whose concentration was 7 38 1 08 log10 gc g of feces the concentrations of cpq 056 and cpq 064 in cat fecal samples were 2 3 orders of magnitude lower than human feces the concentrations of both marker genes 5 79 0 94 cpq 056 and 4 78 1 12 cpq 064 log10 gc g were highly variable in cat feces the concentrations of cpq 056 4 14 0 22 log10 gc g and cpq 064 3 14 0

events 1 and 2 20 100 and 18 90 samples were positive for the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes respectively in contrast among the 10 samples collected during the dry weather event 2 20 were positive for each of cpq 056 sites lp02a and lp3 and cpq 064 sites lp1 and lp02a the concentration of cpq 056 marker gene in quantifiable water samples at a depth 0 5 m ranged from 3 40 to 5 73 log10 gc l of water table 5 these concentrations are equivalent to 0 93 199 μl of untreated sewage l of lake parramatta water similarly the concentration of cpq 064 marker gene in water samples at a depth 0 5 m ranged from 2 90 to 5 07 log10 gc l of water table 6 these concentrations are equivalent to 0 97 144 μl of untreated sewage l of lake water the concentration of cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in quantifiable water samples at a depth 1 m above the bottom ranged from 3 57 to 6 04 and 2 99 to 5 47 log10 gc l of water respectively these concentrations are equivalent to 1 37 μl to 406 μl and 1 20 μl 363 μl of untreated sewage l of water respectively the concentrations of cpq 056 marker gene were greater in sites lp02a lp3 and lp5 storm events 1 and 2 and lp1 and lp2 storm event 2 at a depth 1 m above the bottom compared to 0 5 m below the water surface similarly the concentrations of cpq 064 marker gene were greater in sites lp1 lp02a lp3 and lp5 storm events 1 and 2 and lp2 storm event 2 at a depth 1 m compared to 0 5 m between the two storm events the concentrations of cpq 056 and cpq 064 were higher in samples collected after storm event 1 compared to storm event 2 except sites lp1 and lp2 at a 1 m depth where the concentrations of these markers were similar in both storm events or slightly higher in event 2 compared to event 1 we determined the agreement between cpq 056 and cpq 064 markers in lake parramatta water samples during the course of the study in all 86 6 samples had either co occurrence i e both marker genes were present in 63 3 water samples or absence i e both marker genes were absent in 23 3 water samples a significant p 0 0001 correlation was observed between cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in lake parramatta water samples over the course of the study fig 3 4 discussion viruses are the ideal candidate for mst field studies because they can exhibit greater host specificity than bacteria ahmed et al 2010 however one of the major limitations is that their concentrations can be low in human and other animal feces making them difficult to detect in diluted environmental water samples ahmed et al 2015b crassphage is the most abundant known bacteriophage presumed to infect bacteroidetes in the human intestine which was discovered in 2014 in 2017 stachler and colleagues developed two qpcr assays cpq 056 and cpq 064 targeting crassphage marker genes associated with human feces and sewage these marker genes were reported to be highly prevalent in sewage and sewage contaminated water and specific to untreated sewage in the usa in this study we validated the performance characteristics of crassphage marker genes in human and animal fecal samples collected from australia we also investigated the utility of crassphage marker genes to detect sewage pollution in a recreational lake in sydney nsw the mean concentration of cpq 056 marker gene in untreated sewage was remarkably high 9 43 0 14 log10 gc l furthermore their distributions in three stps located in three geographical locations brisbane perth and tasmania were similar with no apparent variability in concentrations the mean concentrations of cpq 056 reported in this study was similar to a recent study that determined the concentration of cpq 056 range 9 08 9 98 log10 gc l in untreated sewage in subtropical tampa florida ahmed et al 2018a the mean concentration of cpq 064 was 8 91 0 17 log10 gc l marginally lower than the cpq 056 however to the best of our knowledge no other studies to date have determined the concentrations of cpq 064 in per l untreated sewage therefore data obtained in this study cannot yet be compared stachler et al 2017 who originally developed cpq 056 and cpq 064 assays reported their concentrations ng of dna extracted from 10 ml of untreated sewage since we measured the concentrations of untreated dna samples we were able to calculate concentrations of cpq 056 and cpq 064 and they were within the same order of magnitude as reported by stachler et al 2017 another study reported high concentrations of crassphage with values ranging from 5 4 to 6 9 log10 gc ml and an average value of 6 24 log10 gc ml in spain garcia aljaro et al 2017 based on a separate qpcr assay which was not evaluated in the current study the spanish study identified crassphage sequence variation in sewage and found a conserved region of 78 bp fragment which was subsequently chosen to develop a qpcr assay for the quantification of crassphage overall results from this study along with studies from usa and spain suggest a greater prevalence of crassphage in urban stps in three continents the reported concentrations of crassphage in research literature are 2 3 orders of magnitude greater than most commonly used viral markers such as adenovirus polyomavirus and pepper mild mottle viruses ahmed et al 2015a hughes et al 2017 hundesa et al 2010 symonds et al 2016 wolf et al 2010 among the human fecal samples tested in this study 46 1 were positive for both cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes the mean log10 concentrations of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes g of human feces were one order of magnitude lower than l of untreated sewage similar results have been reported for humm2 bach and hf183 bacterial sewage associated markers in a bacteroidales validation study where the concentrations of those markers ng of dna were greater in untreated sewage compared to human feces odagiri et al 2015 as with other enteric viruses such as rotavirus and astrovirus berthiaume et al 1981 clumping or aggregation of crassphage in the feces may affect their detection using qpcr a recent study determined the occurrence of crassphage in 255 human fecal samples from patients with diarrhea in china among the 255 samples 49 19 6 were real time pcr positive for the crassphage similarly cinek et al 2017 also reported highly variable concentrations of crassphage in 20 7 24 of 274 fecal samples collected from children from azerbaijan finland jordan nigeria and sudan the reason for an uneven distribution of crassphage in human feces is not well understood and requires further investigation crassphage presence has been reported to be correlated to consumption of a low carbohydrate high protein diet and it is possible that diet affects their prevalence in the human gut furthermore factors such as host age and health may also influence the stability of a marker gene shanks et al 2008 such as crassphage within a population little is known regarding the host specificity of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 crassphage marker genes since none of the markers currently used for mst studies are absolute host specific 100 host specificity we determined the host specificity of the crassphage marker genes by testing fecal samples from 11 species of animals commonly found in australia this is quite important because erroneously identified implicated sources will result in continued exposure risk and the potential for wasted capital investment for mitigation activities such as upgrading sewer infrastructure kinzelman and ahmed 2014 the host specificity values of the cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in reference dna samples for animal hosts were 0 95 and 0 93 respectively currently there is no benchmark for a host specificity measure of a marker the closer the value to 1 the better the marker is a specificity value 0 80 is considered reasonable and 0 90 is excellent boehm et al 2013 us epa 2005 the original study that developed the cpq 056 and cpq 046 assays reported high host specificity of these markers for animal fecal samples in the usa stachler et al 2017 the host specificity value of one of the crassphage markers i e cpq 056 was further determined in dna samples isolated from animal host groups in tampa florida and found to be 0 92 ahmed et al 2018b high host specificity values reported for cpq 056 and cpq 064 so far are promising and suggesting the suitability of these markers to identify sewage contamination in environmental waters we must make a cautionary statement that the host specificity values reported in this study are based on the animal reference fecal dna samples tested in this study addition of more fecal dna samples or species to the existing reference dna samples may alter the host specificity values in this study both crassphage markers were detected in cattle wastewater and cat fecal samples previous studies also detected cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in animal fecal samples such as two seagulls one dog and poultry litter samples in most cases the concentrations of these marker in animal fecal samples were 4 5 orders of magnitude lower than untreated sewage this may not be an issue as low levels of crassphage marker genes in animal fecal samples may be difficult to detect in environmental water samples due to percent recovery and dilution factors the concentrations of both crassphage markers in cat fecal samples were relatively greater than in cattle wastewater their presence in cat fecal and cattle wastewater samples is unclear and would require further investigation it is possible that some genome regions of crassphage may have homology to other animal associated phages while some regions may be human specific stachler et al 2018 it is also possible that crassphage in cat feces and cattle wastewater are transient population factors such as different primer sets assay conditions geographical region and types of fecal materials may influence host specificity of any given mst marker gene ahmed et al 2018a the second objective of the study was to undertake a field study to determine the application of the crassphage marker genes to identify sewage pollution in environmental waters the field study focused on an urban lake which receives urban stormwater runoff and wwos sydney has an average annual rainfall of 1200 mm which primarily falls between october and may in high intensity storms urban stormwater runoff and wwos to receiving waterways are a significant issue harris 2014 samples collected during storm events 1 and 2 were pcr positive for both crassphage markers in contrast samples collected from dry weather event were mostly below the alod except a couple of samples were positive for the cpq 064 marker gene water samples collected after the storm event 1 had greater abundance of cpq 056 and cpq 064 compared to storm event 2 this could be due to the fact that one of the sensors gauged at four overflow points triggered for approximately 19 h 25 min prior to sampling event 1 indicating more sewage overflowed into lake water compared to sampling event 2 when the same gauged overflow point triggered only for 40 min good agreement was also found for both markers which suggests urban stormwater runoff and wwos containing sewage contribute to the presence of these markers in lake parramatta a recent study also reported a strong correlation between cpq 056 and cpq 064 marker genes in an urban stream impacted by combined sewer overflows stachler et al 2018 the concentrations of both markers at several sampling sites were greater at a depth 1 m above the bottom compared to 0 5 m below the water surface suggesting better persistence of these markers in deep lake water elevated concentrations in deep lake water could be attributed to decreasing uva and uvb wavelength intensity at a greater depth mattioli et al 2017 korajkic et al 2014 reported that exposure to ambient sunlight and biotic interactions are important factors in the decay of sewage borne fib as well as sewage associated marker genes the water samples collected from the lake were turbid and therefore we can hypothesize that turbidity may have reduced light penetration and as a result crassphage marker genes probably decayed slower at the greater depth than the surface water the levels of sewage pollution i e marker genes detected at several sites were high similar levels of sewage pollution have been reported in other studies in the urban environments originating from sewage contaminated stormwater sauer et al 2011 sercu et al 2011 steele et al 2018 van de werfhorst et al 2014 samples collected from the designated swimming enclosure were also positive for both marker genes supporting the recommendation that swimming in the lake immediately after rainfall may pose an increased health risks to swimmers our results are in accordance with the recommendation that people should not swim in the most lakes and rivers in nsw for at least 3 days after heavy rainfall this recommendation however is based on monitoring fecal indicator bacteria the decay of fib in sewage contaminated water may be faster than enteric viruses ahmed et al 2014 therefore a comparative decay of mst markers along with fib and perhaps reference pathogens such as norovirus or adenovirus 40 41 should be undertaken to provide more insight into potential health risks and to determine when it would be safe to swim based on the results of this study we can conclude that sewage pollution is present in lake water samples following storm events and wwos however it is also important to determine whether the levels of crassphage marker genes detected in lake parramatta water samples pose any health risks to swimmers the levels of markers that would potentially pose a health risk have been estimated for the hf183 using different qmra approaches boehm et al 2013 ahmed et al 2018b according to the qmra estimates a level 3 50 log10 gc 100 ml ahmed et al 2018a and 3 62 log10 gc 100 ml boehm et al 2015 of hf183 marker gene will exceed a risk benchmark of 36 1000 and 32 1000 people the qmra models used by boehm et al 2015 and ahmed et al 2018b can be further improved by incorporating pathogens decay recovery and transport models a similar model can also be developed for crassphage marker genes currently the qmra analysis is hindered by lack of pathogen and marker concentration data in sewage the ratio of sewage associated markers and reference pathogens such as norovirus and adenovirus 40 41 needs to be established in untreated and treated sewage samples in a longitudinal survey for at least one year currently limited data are available on the concentrations of mst markers and enteric viruses in australian sewage more data when available will allow us to determine the risk associated with enteric viruses using sewage associated markers 5 conclusions both crassphage marker genes cpq 056 and cpq 064 are highly specific to human and abundant in untreated wastewater their high concentrations and less variability in untreated wastewater highlight their suitability for tracking sewage pollution in water since both markers showed cross reactivity with cat fecal and cattle wastewater samples it is recommended that both markers should be used simultaneously if possible along with an additional sewage associated i e such as hf183 or adenovirus markers in mst field studies to obtain confirmatory results the high abundance of both markers in lake water samples collected after storm events compared to low prevalence in dry weather event suggests sewage pollution is occurring in the lake and urban stormwater runoff is the likely contributing factor transporting this pollution from gauged overflow point of the sewerage system in the catchment further research would be required to understand the decay kinetics of crassphage markers in environmental waters in relation to fib and pathogens furthermore qmra analysis also needs to be undertaken to establish what levels of markers would pose a human health risk to swimmers or other recreational water users acknowledgments we thank sydney water for financial assistance and for support in collection of water samples and

19344,an enteric virus surrogate and reliable domestic wastewater tracer is needed to manage microbial quality of food and water as waste water reuse becomes more prevalent in response to population growth urbanization and climate change pepper mild mottle virus pmmov a plant pathogen found at high concentrations in domestic wastewater is a promising surrogate for enteric viruses that has been incorporated into over 29 water and food related microbial quality and technology investigations around the world this review consolidates the available literature from across disciplines to provide guidance on the utility of pmmov as either an enteric virus surrogate and or domestic wastewater marker in various situations synthesis of the available research supports pmmov as a useful enteric virus process indicator since its high concentrations in source water allow for identifying the extent of virus log reductions in field pilot and full scale waste water treatment systems pmmov reduction levels during many forms of wastewater treatment were less than or equal to the reduction of other viruses suggesting this virus can serve as an enteric virus surrogate when evaluating new treatment technologies pmmov excels as an index virus for enteric viruses in environmental waters exposed to untreated domestic wastewater because it was detected more frequently and in higher concentrations than other human viruses in groundwater 72 2 and surface waters freshwater 94 5 and coastal 72 2 with pathogen co detection rates as high as 72 3 additionally pmmov is an important microbial source tracking marker most appropriately associated with untreated domestic wastewater where its pooled specificity is 90 and pooled sensitivity is 100 as opposed to human feces where its pooled sensitivity is only 11 3 a limited number of studies have also suggested that pmmov may be a useful index virus for enteric viruses in monitoring the microbial quality of fresh produce and shellfish but further research is needed on these topics finally future work is needed to fill in knowledge gaps regarding pmmov s global specificity and sensitivity graphical abstract image 1 keywords domestic wastewater water reuse fecal pollution water quality indicator enteric pathogens 1 introduction domestic wastewater pollution is a major global public health concern due to the high concentrations of diverse pathogens in feces the prevalence of wastewater pollution worldwide and the important role water plays in everyday activities unicef and world health organization 2015 specifically enteric viruses are one the most problematic pathogen types and among the most important emerging waterborne pathogens because of their low infectious doses high concentrations in human feces long persistence in the environment and resistance to waste water treatment summarized in fong and lipp 2005 gerba et al 2017 lin and ganesh 2013 nwachcuku and gerba 2004 sinclair et al 2009 symonds and breitbart 2015 us national research council 2012 therefore to manage the health risks associated with wastewater pollution and achieve the united nations sustainable development goals united nations 2015 it is important to measure enteric viruses in environmental waters and waste water treatment and reuse systems directly measuring enteric viruses in water and food can be difficult and expensive consequently surrogates are often used to indirectly measure the presence of enteric viruses ashbolt et al 2001 sinclair et al 2012 in public health related microbiology a surrogate is a substance e g caffeine or microbe e g human norovirus hnov escherichia coli whose presence reflects pathogen persistence and can therefore be used to explore the risk of contamination in food and in the environment as well as the efficacy of various waste water treatment technologies with respect to human enteric pathogens microbial surrogates are divided into the following categories process indicators index or model surrogates also termed organisms reference pathogens and fecal indicators surrogates that characterize the efficacy of a specific treatment are classified as process indicators index and model surrogates are most frequently used to represent a specific pathogen type e g e coli for bacterial enteric pathogens while reference pathogens are human pathogens that are used to infer the occurrence of similar pathogens e g hnov is a reference pathogen for enteric viruses finally fecal indicators and markers refer to surrogates that identify the presence of fecal material and not necessarily the presence of a particular pathogen or group of pathogens the world health organization who recommends monitoring the microbial quality of waste water and food using indicator organisms e g fecal indicator bacteria fib bacteriophages and reference pathogens e g hnov in lieu of measuring all of the human pathogens that are possibly present world health organization 2006 2009 2010 2011 over the last four decades numerous studies have demonstrated that fib among the most frequently used and easily measured water quality parameters ashbolt et al 2001 does not correlate with or predict the presence of enteric viruses in treated waste water shellfish environmental waters and fresh produce carducci et al 2009 eregno et al 2018 fout et al 2017 gerba et al 2017 griffin et al 2001 harwood et al 2005 labelle et al 1980 li et al 2015 savichtcheva and okabe 2006 schets et al 2008 sinclair et al 2012 stewart et al 2008 symonds et al 2014 verbyla et al 2016 wu et al 2011 yates 2007 this is not surprising given the vastly different physical characteristics of fib and enteric viruses which result in disparate responses to treatment and environmental conditions an alternate surrogate for enteric viruses is therefore needed in order to better predict risk and protect human health while a variety of bacteriophages can be measured with culture based assays and are therefore affordable enteric virus surrogates to monitor fecal pollution and waste water treatment efficiency these bacteriophages do not consistently correlate with the presence of enteric viruses eregno et al 2018 fout et al 2017 lin and ganesh 2013 santiago rodriguez et al 2013 savichtcheva and okabe 2006 additionally recently identified and abundant crassphage has been proposed as a viral fecal pollution indicator dutilh et al 2014 stachler and bibby 2014 however more research is needed to understand its correlation with infectious human enteric viruses in contaminated environments and throughout wastewater treatment before crassphage can be used as an index or process enteric virus indicator garcía aljaro et al 2017 stachler et al 2017 the concentrations of some commonly used reference enteric viruses such as hnov or rotavirus group a arv vary widely based on disease epidemiology ranging from undetected to nearly 107 virus targets l 1 wastewater gerba et al 2017 kitajima et al 2014 other reference enteric viruses include human adenoviruses hadv aichiviruses haiv and polyomaviruses hpyv which are consistently measured at 104 to 107 virus targets l 1 domestic wastewater kitajima et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 however since the abundance of reference enteric viruses found in wastewater is dependent upon the extent of infection and shedding in the population their use as enteric virus surrogates to test waste water treatment technologies gerba et al 2017 kato et al 2018 li et al 2015 sano et al 2016 and manage microbial water and food quality

as 109 viral targets g 1 dry weight zhang et al 2006 since zhang et al published their study in 2006 other metagenomic studies have verified the abundance of pmmov in human feces moore et al 2015 nakamura et al 2009 victoria et al 2009 untreated domestic wastewater wang et al 2018 tertiary treated domestic wastewater rosario et al 2009a and even indoor air filters rosario et al 2018

variety of different disciplines to understand how and when pmmov can best be used as an enteric virus surrogate and or domestic wastewater marker fig 1 2 methods 2 1 literature search all published peer reviewed wastewater treatment and water quality studies using pmmov were identified via google scholar searches executed from may 2017 to may 2018 to identify these studies google scholar searches were executed using the following keywords in may 2017 fecal pollution pepper mild mottle virus and wastewater pollution at that time google scholar alerts were created for studies citing previously published pmmov related articles specifically rosario et al 2009b symonds et al 2016 symonds et al 2014 verbyla et al 2016 as well as the aforementioned keywords lastly an additional google scholar search using the same keywords was executed prior to manuscript publication in june 2018 to ensure that all peer reviewed published water quality studies using pmmov had been identified and considered in this review 2 2 pooled data calculations the data from a total of 22 peer reviewed published studies were reviewed and consolidated with respect to pmmov detection concentration and pathogen co occurrence the pooled human associated sensitivity e g the percentage of pmmov positive human fecal and domestic wastewater samples and specificity e g the percentage of pmmov negative non human fecal samples were determined by consolidating the data from 16 and three investigations respectively additionally environmental water samples from 17 different published studies were classified by water type groundwater coastal seawater and brackish water and inland freshwater and subsequently by the type of domestic wastewater contamination which was characterized as point or non point sources of untreated or treated domestic wastewater for each combination of environmental water sample type and type of domestic wastewater contamination the pooled positive pmmov detection rate pmmov minimum and maximum concentration and the pmmov pooled pathogen co occurrence rate was determined while the majority of studies specifically compared pmmov presence to that other enteric viruses several studies also included enteric parasites and bacteria thus the pooled pathogen co occurrence rate refers to the co occurrence of pmmov and any human enteric pathogen 2 3 review of the waste water treatment and water quality studies this review summarizes all the previously published and some unpublished investigations that have incorporated the use of pmmov as a fecal associated virus surrogate this manuscript begins by discussing pmmov ecology and origin in human feces next it summarizes how pmmov is identified and quantified in a variety of sample types followed by a review of pmmov occurrence and persistence in natural environments and engineered systems a more detailed discussion is included on the use of pmmov as a domestic wastewater microbial source tracking mst tool finally this review discusses the compiled and pooled data as well as identifies directions for future research 3 pepper mild mottle virus ecology and its origin in human feces pmmov is a rod shaped non enveloped positive sense single stranded rna virus approximately 18 nm in diameter and 300 310 nm in length with an isoelectric point the ph when the virus has a neutral charge ranging from 3 7 to 3 8 king et al 2011 michen and graule 2010 wetter et al 1984 belonging to the virgaviridae family and tobamovirus genus this pepper plant pathogen is transmitted via mechanical contact with contaminated soil and or seed and causes fruit malformation and leaf mosaic in capsicum species throughout asia australia europe in middle east and north and south america adkins et al 2001 ahmad et al 2015 alonso et al 1991 beczner et al 1997 çağlar et al 2013 garcia luque et al 1993 genda et al 2007 han et al 2017 ichiki et al 2009 kaur et al 2014 milošević et al 2015 oliveira et al 2010 wang et al 2006 wetter et al 1984 yu et al 2018 pmmov has a 6356 nt genome that encodes for a capsid two replication associated proteins 126 kda and 183 kda and a cell to cell movement associated protein banović đeri et al 2018 oliveira et al 2010 given the limited genetic variability of pmmov it has been suggested that the pmmov genome is highly stable rodriguez cerezo et al 1989 and limited sequence variation has been observed among geographic regions yu et al 2018 like many other plant pathogens belonging to the virgaviridae family that are found in domestic wastewater cantalupo et al 2011 pmmov has a dietary origin in human feces colson et al 2010 zhang et al 2006 in 2016 approximately 39 million tonnes of peppers were produced throughout the world food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2018 processed pepper products such as dry spices and sauces from the united states of america france mexico china and elsewhere have tested positive for pmmov and sauces can contain as many as 108 8 pmmov targets ml 1 colson et al 2010 peng et al 2015 zhang et al 2006 remarkably infectious pmmov are present in food products as well as feces colson et al 2010 peng et al 2015 zhang et al 2006 while pmmov has not been reported to replicate in the human gut scientists have hypothesized and investigated its replication in humans due to its high concentration in feces colson et al 2010 mandal and jain 2010 zhang et al 2006 and association with fever and other immune responses colson et al 2010 taken together pmmov s genetic stability and its persistence in globally distributed processed pepper products and human feces make it an attractive domestic wastewater indicator which is defined in this review as a microbe or chemical that identifies the presence of fecal material and not necessarily the presence of a particular pathogen or group of pathogens sinclair et al 2012 4 identifying and quantifying pepper mild mottle virus 4 1 virus isolation and or concentration methods nucleic acid isolation is the first step in identifying pmmov and the methods to do so vary by sample type for pepper produce in an agricultural context pmmov rna is usually isolated from either the seeds or leaves of the infected capsicum plant via mechanical disruption çağlar et al 2013 ichiki et al 2009 ikegashira et al 2004 kaur et al 2014 wang et al 2006 in processed food products domestic wastewater and feces supernatant pmmov rna is often in high enough concentrations to be directly detected colson et al 2010 peng et al 2015 symonds et al 2016 if pmmov is suspected to be in lower concentrations which is often the case in settings where fecal pollution is being measured then virus concentration methods are necessary prior to detection assays standard methods iso ts15216 1 2013 for viruses have been used to isolate and concentrate pmmov from lettuce verbyla et al 2016 and shellfish ingeborg boxman personal communication for water matrices the virus isolation and concentration methods vary by water type pmmov as well as enteric viruses in small volume samples 2 l are typically isolated using adsorption elution methods with electronegative membrane filters betancourt et al 2014 han et al 2014 kato et al 2018 kitajima et al 2014 sangsanont et al 2016 sassi et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 tandukar et al 2018 which is sometimes followed by the concentration of the eluent using peg precipitation hamza et al 2011 or centrifugal filter concentrators asami et al 2016 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 lee et al 2017 rachmadi et al 2015 sangsanont et al 2016 sassi et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016 tandukar et al 2018 alternatively it is possible to directly purify virus nucleic acids from the electronegative membrane filter used in the adsorption elution methods ahmed et al 2018 hughes et al 2017 symonds et al 2014 2017 verbyla et al 2016 centrifugal filter concentrators have also been used to directly concentrate smaller volumes 20 ml of waste water when high virus concentrations were anticipated rosario et al 2009b symonds et al 2015 viruses including pmmov in higher volume samples 30 l typically used to test groundwater and potable water have been concentrated with nanoceram filters betancourt et al 2014 glass wool filters hruby et al 2013 cartridge mixed cellulose ester filters kuroda et al 2015 and hollow fiber ultrafilters gu et al 2018 mcginnis et al 2018 rosiles gonzález et al 2017 since all of the aforementioned virus concentration methods have been developed for enteric viruses that have a different capsid structure compared to pmmov future investigations should ensure that pmmov is similarly concentrated haramoto et al 2018 the theoretical process limit of detection which assumes 100 recovery of pmmov cdna from the original volume samples is often not reported however it can be as low as 4 28 targets l 1 when 1000 l volumes are concentrated hruby et al 2013 and as high as 1000 targets l 1 when 50 ml volumes are concentrated shrestha et al 2018 the use of process controls which is usually a virus similar to the enteric reference virus analyzed is necessary to ensure effective virus concentration and detection haramoto et al 2018 recently one study incorporated cucumber green mottle mosaic virus also belonging to the tobamovirus genus as a virus concentration process control for pmmov kato et al 2018 4 2 detection and quantification methods while pmmov like particles can be visualized using electron microscopy colson et al 2010 peng et al 2015 pmmov is most frequently detected using either molecular or immunological based methods in agriculture çağlar et al 2013 ikegashira et al 2004 kaur et al 2014 wang et al 2006 rapid lab free immunological based tests designed for agricultural contexts are available to test leaf tissue or seeds for pmmov immunostrip agdia elkhart in usa reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt pcr beczner et al 1997 çağlar et al 2013 kaur et al 2014 milošević et al 2015 wang et al 2006 is frequently used to identify pmmov and the complete genomes of several strains have been sequenced alonso et al 1991 avila rincon et al 1989 garcia luque et al 1990 hagiwara et al 2002 oliveira et al 2010 velasco et al 2002 wang et al 2006 in contrast to agriculture molecular based methods are primarily used for detecting pmmov in microbial water and food quality contexts hamza et al 2011 haramoto et al 2013 rosario et al 2009b zhang et al 2006 and methods have even been created to discriminate between infectious and non infectious pmmov particles lee et al 2018 in fecal pollution studies rt pcr and rt quantitative pcr rt qpcr are the most common forms of molecular detection and quantification of pmmov a variety of rna purification kits have been used successfully with the most appropriate kit dependent on the sample type asami et al 2016 betancourt et al 2014 colson et al 2010 haramoto et al 2013 symonds et al 2014 2015 2016 2017 verbyla et al 2016 reverse transcription is generally executed as a two step process in which purified rna is reversed transcribed with random hexamer primers using the first strand synthesis superscript iii reverse transcription kit invitrogen carlsbad ca usa ahmed et al 2018 hughes et al 2017 rosario et al 2009b rosiles gonzález et al 2017 symonds et al 2015 symonds et

quantitative rt pcr system life technologies carlsbad ca usa colson et al 2010 several endpoint rt pcr and rt qpcr assays have been developed which target either the pmmov capsid or replication associated proteins table 1 although some of the pcr assays were developed for infected capsicum specimens haramoto et al 2013 and rosiles gonzález et al 2017 have used these assays for water matrices çağlar et al 2013 and processed food products peng et al 2015 respectively additionally the pcr assay developed by zhang et al 2006 has also been used to test feces and waste water matrices symonds et al 2017 with respect to quantitative methods hamza et al 2011 created a sybr based rt qpcr assay with a reported detection limit of 5 targets the pmmov hydrolysis qpcr assay which is preceded by a separate rt reaction was originally designed by zhang et al 2006 and then the forward primer was modified by the addition of a thymine nucleotide to better match pmmov isolates haramoto et al 2013 five years ago haramoto et al 2013 replaced the tamra quencher with a minor groove binding nonfluorescent quencher mgbnfq this modification lowered the limit of quantification from 100 targets to 10 targets while many papers have utilized the zhang et al 2006 primers and probes ahmed et al 2018 colson et al 2010 hruby et al 2013 hughes et al 2017 peng et al 2015 rosario et al 2009b sangsanont et al 2016 symonds et al 2014 most recent papers have used the pmmv fp1 rev and pmmv rp1 primers with the pmmv taqman mgb probe or equivalent type of probe asami et al 2016 betancourt et al 2014 gu et al 2018 haramoto et al 2013 kato et al 2018 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 lee et al 2017 2018 rachmadi et al 2015 rosiles gonzález et al 2017 saeidi et al 2018 sassi et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016

domestic wastewater and treatment since people consume food products cultivated and produced from around the world it is reasonable to believe that pmmov will be found in domestic wastewater worldwide however studies are lacking to prove this assertion to date pmmov has been detected in domestic wastewater from australia hughes et al 2017 bolivia symonds et al 2014 brasil verbyla symonds unpublished data costa rica symonds et al 2017 germany hamza et al 2011 guatemala symonds breitbart unpublished data japan lee et al 2017 kenya nicolette zhou scott meschke personal communication nepal shrestha et al 2018 south korea han et al 2014 the united states of america u s kitajima et al 2014 rosario et al 2009b schmitz et al 2016 and vietnam kuroda et al 2015 pmmov is typically found at concentrations ranging from 106 to 1010 targets l 1 in untreated domestic wastewater table 2 pmmov abundance in domestic wastewater did not significantly vary when measured daily for two weeks rosario et al 2009b nor monthly for one year kitajima et al 2014 additionally pmmov is consistently more abundant than other human enteric viruses and proposed virus surrogates in domestic wastewater bofill mas et al 2006 carducci et al 2009 jothikumar et al 2005 kitajima et al 2014 laverick et al 2004 schmitz et al 2016 symonds et al 2014 2017 the consistently high concentrations of pmmov in untreated domestic wastewater make it a good candidate as an index virus for enteric viruses in polluted environmental waters produce and shellfish as well as a process indicator for measuring enteric virus removal during waste water treatment and water reclamation in full scale domestic wastewater effluent pmmov has been consistently found in concentrations ranging from 101 109 targets l 1 table 2 with reduction levels less than or equal to the reduction of other viruses hamza et al 2011 hughes et al 2017 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009b schmitz et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 symonds et al 2014 to date a benchtop electrocoagulation unit is the only wastewater treatment technology that has demonstrated pmmov reductions to concentrations below the limit of detection corresponding to reductions as great as 5 log10 symonds et al 2015 the greatest pmmov target reductions on full scale systems were observed at two u s wastewater treatment plants wwtps using advanced bardenpho technologies in which pmmov targets were reduced as great as 4 log10 and coincided with greater human virus reductions schmitz et al 2016 for a conventional activated sludge system in germany approximately 3 log10 pmmov target reduction was observed which was similar to reductions of hpyv torque teno virus and slightly greater than culturable somatic coliphage hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009b determined similar log10 reductions for some conventional activated sludge systems with disinfection in the u s however one third of the systems analyzed had as 1 log10 pmmov target reductions several other studies analyzing a variety of full scale domestic wwtps also demonstrated approximately 1 log10 pmmov reductions at an australian activated sludge wwtp with disinfection a 1 1 log10 pmmov target reduction was observed which was approximately 2 log10 less than the reduction of hadv and hpyv hnov and hev reductions were slightly greater 2 log10 than those observed for pmmov hughes et al 2017 similarly pmmov and hadv had 1 log10 target reductions at a sequential batch reactor wwtp in vietnam kuroda et al 2015 in two wastewater treatment pond systems in bolivia symonds et al 2014 also observed 1 log10 pmmov hnov and arv reductions however culturable human enteroviruses hev were reduced by 1 log10 in two other studies on virus reduction during activated sludge and biological trickling filter pmmov had 1 log10 reductions which was similar to haiv and coincided with minimum reductions in hnov sapovirus hsav hev hadv hpyv and arv kitajima et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 5 2 drinking water treatment and reclamation systems the consistently high pmmov concentrations present in domestic wastewater make pmmov a potential process indicator of enteric virus removal in drinking water treatment and reclamation systems currently pmmov has been incorporated into seven investigations researching the viral log reduction in point of use sangsanont et al 2016 as well as drinking water treatment plant technologies e g coagulation rapid sand filtration membrane filtration asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 lee et al 2017 shirasaki et al 2017 shirasaki et al 2018 unlike hadv haiv hev and f specific coliphage pmmov was the only waterborne virus detected in drinking water sources e g pond and tapwater prior to point of use treatment in a study executed in vietnam thus pmmov was an essential enteric virus process indicator during point of use field testing sangsanont et al 2016 in addition laboratory testing determined that the log removal of pmmov was comparable to that of hadv and haiv and less than hev sangsanont et al 2016 pmmov was also a useful process indicator of enteric viruses in a pilot scale treatment plant as well as full scale drinking water treatment plants due to its consistently high concentrations in source water in japan kato et al 2018 lee et al 2017 and thailand asami et al 2016 in addition to its high concentrations in source water pmmov removal was similar to that of human viral pathogens of interest and rarely overestimated removal of these viruses by the drinking water treatment technologies tested to date asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 lee et al 2017 shirasaki et al 2017 2018 no correlation was identified between human viral pathogens and fib in source water and post treatment waters fib had greater log removal than that of pmmov and other viruses asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 sangsanont et al 2016 pmmov removal was most significantly positively correlated with the removal of hadv hav murine nov mnv haiv hnovgii and human coxsackieviruses hcv via coagulation rapid sand filtration as well as via membrane filtration processes thus it is a more appropriate process indicator of viral removal in comparison to bacteriophages ms2 and φx174 which did not correlate as well with human viral pathogens kato et al 2018 shirasaki et al 2017 2018 in another study on ultrafiltration with coagulation sedimentation virus removal pmmov removal rates were also similar to human enteric viruses hnov and haiv however only culturable bacteriophage demonstrated additional virus removal when coagulation sedimentation was combined with ultrafiltration lee et al 2017 despite pmmov s utility as an enteric virus removal process indicator it is possible that pmmov may need to be combined with a culturable assay or another type of selective treatment for infectious particles e g lee et al 2018 in order to effectively measure virus inactivation during treatment 5 3 contaminated surface waters since pmmov was first proposed as an indicator of fecal pollution this virus has been incorporated into 16 published studies analyzing microbial quality of freshwater brackish waters and seawater with and without known sources of domestic wastewater pollution in australia hughes et al 2017 bolivia verbyla et al 2016 costa rica symonds et al 2017 germany hamza et al 2011 japan haramoto et al 2013 mexico rosiles gonzález et al 2017 nepal shrestha et al 2018 tandukar et al 2018 singapore gu et al 2018 saeidi et al 2018 u s betancourt et al 2014 mcginnis et al 2018 rosario et al 2009b sassi et al 2018 symonds et al 2016 and vietnam kuroda et al 2015 it is important to note that pmmov has not been detected in environmental waters in the absence of human fecal pollution and that pmmov rna persisted in seawater for approximately 1 week at temperatures ranging from 31 to 33 c and in river water for approximately 10 days at 25 c and as long as 21 days at 4 c hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009b the persistence of pmmov in surface freshwater was comparable to caffeine in surface freshwater contaminated with known point sources of domestic wastewater kuroda et al 2015 additionally pmmov detection exceeded the detection of other enteric viruses in rivers contaminated by domestic wastewater treatment effluent and was detected as far as 32 km downstream from the discharge pipe sassi et al 2018 pmmov did not significantly correlate with fib in coastal waters hughes et al 2017 symonds et al 2016 2017 or inland freshwater hamza et al 2011 mcginnis et al 2018 symonds et al 2016 however one study in singapore identified significant positive correlations between pmmov and the fib enterococci and e coli in fresh surface waters saeidi et al 2018 pmmov concentrations were also correlated with residential and green areas in singapore saeidi et al 2018 in coastal waters pmmov was detected in 72 2 52 9 and 11 4 of surface water samples exposed to ocean outfalls discharging secondary treated chlorinated domestic waster known non point domestic wastewater sources and possible but unconfirmed domestic wastewater pollution respectively table 3 hughes et al 2017 rosario et al 2009b symonds et al 2016 2017 sixty one percent of coastal water samples exposed to ocean outfalls discharging secondary treated and chlorinated domestic wastewater were positive for both pmmov and at least one human pathogen e g hpyv hnov hadv hev and this percentage decreased to 0 as the extent of known domestic wastewater pollution decreased table 3 in coastal waters without known domestic wastewater pollution it is possible that pmmov may persist for longer periods of time in comparison to other enteric viruses because pmmov concentrations were quantified at 104 targets l 1 with a 0 pathogen co occurrence however care is needed when making this observation since the sample size was limited to just five positive samples in coastal waters exposed to point and non point domestic wastewater pollution pmmov exhibited a significant positive correlation with the human associated mst markers bacteroides hf183 and hpyv symonds et al 2016 however in coastal waters exposed to stormwater runoff pmmov did not co occur with bacteroides hf183 which was present more often and in greater concentrations hughes et al 2017 initially it was thought that pmmov may be an ultraconservative fecal pollution indicator due to its persistence throughout wastewater treatment hamza et al 2011 kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009b sassi et al 2018 however recent coastal fecal pollution studies have shown that pmmov detection appropriately relates to risk of illness ahmed et al 2018 hughes et al 2017 symonds et al 2016 for example two of these investigations on the pmmov process limits of detection and quantification demonstrated that the mere detection of pmmov in coastal water samples seeded with untreated and secondary treated domestic wastewater corresponded to health risks of hnov and hadv infection exceeding the united states of america environmental protection agency u s epa health benchmark 36 1000 people for safe recreation ahmed et al 2018 symonds et al 2016 specifically 5 44 103 pmmov targets l 1 corresponded to the health benchmark for hnov and hadv illness when coastal water was contaminated with untreated domestic wastewater ahmed et al 2018 for coastal water contaminated with secondary treated domestic wastewater 2 00 104 pmmov targets l 1 and 1 78 103 pmmov targets l 1 corresponded to the health benchmark for hnov and hadv respectively the health risks of hnov and hadv infection associated with detectable and quantifiable pmmov concentrations per untreated and secondary treated domestic wastewater pollution were similar to those previously identified for other human associated fecal markers however hf183 was more sensitive and was able to identify contamination below the health benchmark ahmed et al 2018 boehm et al 2015 staley et al 2012 symonds et al 2016 in comparison to hpyv pmmov may be a more sensitive index virus for enteric viruses because the hpyv limit of detection and quantification corresponded to health risks exceeding the u s epa health benchmark ahmed et al 2018 staley et al 2012 moving inland to freshwater systems pmmov was detected in 90 8 86 3 and 67 5 of river creek canal and pond surface waters exposed to point sources of untreated domestic wastewater secondary treated domestic wastewater and unknown sources respectively table 3 pmmov co detection with human pathogens in inland freshwater systems exposed to point source pollution was 72 3 when domestic wastewater was not treated and 67 5 when it was treated these co detection rates are greater than those observed for coastal seawater and groundwater additionally pmmov significantly correlated with enteric viruses and hpyv even though it was more prevalent in microbial water quality investigations in germany hamza et al 2011 and nepal tandukar et al 2018 despite similar co detection rates of pmmov and human pathogens in systems receiving treated versus untreated wastewater pmmov concentrations were greatest in surface freshwater exposed to untreated domestic wastewater which includes studies executed in regions lacking sanitation kuroda et al 2015 shrestha et al 2018 verbyla et al 2016 as well as those exposed to combined sewer overflows csos mcginnis et al 2018 unlike the studies executed in areas lacking sanitation cso creek water had the lowest pmmov concentrations and only 57 of cso creek water samples positive for pmmov were also positive for at least one of the following pathogens hadv hev hnov gi hnov gii campylobacter jejuni enterohemorrhagic e coli and salmonella mcginnis et al 2018 interestingly pmmov and human marker bacteroides hf183 were detected in all creek water samples collected for this study despite problems with rt qpcr inhibition 5 4 groundwater pmmov has been integrated into five groundwater studies in north america and asia pmmov was detected in 72 2 and 35 3 of groundwater samples collected from areas with known point source and non point source domestic wastewater pollution respectively in concentrations ranging from 0 4 to 1 00 107 targets l 1 table 3 the first groundwater fecal pollution study to include pmmov was executed in iowa u s and only 22 of the wells sampled n 66 tested positive for at least one fecal associated microorganism hruby et al 2013 pmmov was the most frequently detected microbial target found in 17 of samples however no correlation was identified between pmmov and any of the microbial indicators e coli enterococci total coliforms male specific and somatic coliphages or pathogens hnov hadv hpyv bovine polyomavirus swine hepatitis e salmonella campylobacter and enterohemorrhagic e coli in another study groundwater collected near managed aquifer recharge sites in the u s more frequently contained pmmov which often co occurred with the presence of pathogens betancourt et al 2014 outside of the u s pmmov was found in only 38 of samples n 8 while total coliforms and e coli were found in 78 and 11 respectively in vietnam kuroda et al 2015 in an area with extensive domestic wastewater pollution in nepal pmmov and tobacco mosaic virus were detected in 83 of groundwater samples n 6 while hnov was only found in one sample and hsav hev haiv hadv hpyv and arv were not detected shrestha et al 2018 in the northeastern yucatan peninsula aquifer system in mexico pmmov was detected in 85 of sinkhole samples mixture of fresh and brackish water n 20 while coliphages were found in 80 of samples and total coliforms exceeded concentrations of 770 mpn 100 ml in 100 of samples rosiles gonzález et al 2017 no correlation was identified between pmmov and coliphages total coliforms or e coli in this study unfortunately no pathogens were analyzed given the limited sample size and number of investigations and the difficulties measuring enteric viruses in groundwater the correlation and co detection of pmmov and various pathogens in groundwater remains to be determined table 3 nevertheless pmmov appears to be a conservative surrogate for enteric viruses in groundwater given its presence in greater concentrations compared to human viruses betancourt et al 2014 hruby et al 2013 kuroda et al 2015 shrestha et al 2018 5 5 bottled water and food safety the use of pmmov as an indicator of microbial quality in food and bottled water has yet to be fully explored in a study comparing pmmov and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps as tracers of fecal pollution in a watershed pmmov was not identified in bottled water n 3 despite the occurrence of ppcps n 2 fib n 1 and or hadv n 1 kuroda et al 2015 based upon this study it appears that pmmov could underestimate and ppcps could overestimate the extent of fecal pollution in bottled water pmmov has also been used in two studies investigating microbial quality of irrigation water in which it was detected more frequently than human viral pathogens shrestha et al 2018 verbyla et al 2016 only verbyla et al 2016 measured crop microbial quality and demonstrated that pmmov may be a conservative enteric virus surrogate to manage the microbial quality of crops irrigated with wastewater contaminated water sources future studies are needed to ascertain the role of pmmov as an enteric virus surrogate in these contexts to date pmmov has only been incorporated into one investigation on shellfish microbial quality which has not been published previously ingeborg boxman personal communication in a dutch program 2008 2009 monitoring shellfish on the dutch market and directly collected from european harvesting areas viruses were isolated from shellfish samples using standard methods iso ts15216 1 2013 pmmov was detected in a higher percentage of oyster and mussel samples than nov with both viruses assayed by rt qpcr pmmov and nov were detected in 65 75 115 and 18 21 115 of the oyster samples respectively whereas pmmov and nov were detected in 74 64 86 and 42 36 86 of the mussels sampled out of the nov positive shellfish samples pmmov co occurred with nov in 86 18 21 of oysters and 92 33 36 of mussels out of the pmmov positive shellfish samples tested nov co occurred in 24 18 75 of oysters and 52 33 64 of mussels thus pmmov shows promise as a conservative viral indicator of microbial quality in shellfish future studies are needed to understand how pmmov depuration and retention rates compare with pathogens of interest 6 pepper mild mottle virus as a domestic wastewater microbial source tracking marker mst was developed to discriminate between human and wildlife sources of fecal pollution in water bodies mst markers aim to target genes of microbes that are specific to the host species specificity and prevalent within the host species sensitivity as summarized in harwood et al 2013b identifying genes of human associated bacteria and viruses are of particular interest because sewage pollution poses a greater threat to human health than wildlife sources generally harwood et al 2013b soller et al 2010 stoeckel and harwood 2007 the most routinely used human associated markers include hf183 hpyv humm2 and humm3 summarized in harwood et al 2013b these and other human associated markers are often used in conjunction with wildlife markers to characterize fecal contamination in impaired water bodies mst methodologies ultimately help identify dominant sources of fecal contamination leading to more informed water quality assessment and targeted remediation practices pmmov has been utilized in many fecal pollution studies but only three studies to date have specifically assessed its potential as a domestic wastewater marker by testing for specificity i e the ratio of pmmov positive non human feces samples to total non human feces tested in fecal samples from chickens cows dogs horses pigs seabirds and other organisms table 4 hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009b symonds et al 2017 while specificity testing across non target organisms remains geographically limited to costa rica germany and the u s sensitivity testing has occurred with numerous types of domestic wastewater samples across ten countries pmmov sensitivity across numerous studies was 97 9 n 446 in domestic wastewater and or effluent undergoing different treatments river water exposed to wwtp effluent and surface water exposed to untreated wastewater tables 2 and 3 the specificity and sensitivity of pmmov as a domestic wastewater associated marker are similar to those of hf183 hpyv humm2 humm3 and other human associated mst markers summarized in harwood et al 2013b similar to other markers one potential limitation of pmmov for mst is its lower specificity due to cross reactivity with chicken seagull goose and cow feces where pmmov can be detected at the same concentration range as human feces thus pmmov may not be a suitable marker in areas where these animals are prevalent table 4 additionally pmmov was not always present at detectable levels in individual fecal samples from children and adults which were mostly collected in france table 2 pmmov s sensitivity in human feces is only slightly lower than that reported for hpyv and some bacteroidales assays harwood et al 2013b and it is possible that pmmov may be more frequently encountered in regions that consume more processed pepper products to obtain a clearer global specificity value we recommend specificity testing with non target organisms across a wider geographic range despite these limitations our meta analysis suggests that pmmov currently has a specificity of 90 0 n 150 and sensitivity ranging from 11 3 n 478 human feces only to 100 n 126 untreated domestic wastewater only thus it is more appropriate to consider pmmov a domestic wastewater associated marker than a human fecal marker overall the concomitant presence of pmmov in domestic wastewater effluent and water sources exposed to different effluent sources suggests that pmmov is mostly human specific and should be incorporated into the mst toolbox for use as a domestic wastewater marker the utility of pmmov as a tool for mst was exemplified in an investigation of the reedy creek watershed kissimmee fl u s in which the absence of pmmov confirmed that the high fib concentrations were from natural sources e g wildlife vegetation and not from the water reclamation facility young et al 2014 nguyen et al in review while hf183 typically a domestic wastewater marker was measured in this study it could not serve as a domestic wastewater marker since it was identified in natural sources as well as deer feces nguyen et al in review this study highlights the need to have multiple domestic wastewater markers available for mst finally caution needs to be used when applying pmmov as a pollution marker in areas where pepper processing occurrs as well as in areas irrigating with reclaimed water e g tertiary treated and disinfected wastewater 7 discussion this comprehensive review indicates that pmmov can be used to inform microbial water quality and shows potential to characterize the microbial quality of fresh produce and shellfish cultivated in or with environmental waters in the americas australia asia and europe our synthesis of the available literature supports pmmov as a useful enteric virus process indicator to evaluate waste water treatment technologies and a unique and important process indicator to measure virus removal in full scale systems even though pmmov removal and reduction did not always coincide with all enteric viruses or culturable virus indicators pmmov frequently co occurred with pathogens of interest furthermore pmmov s naturally high concentrations in wastewater were essential for determining the degree and mechanisms of viral reduction during full scale treatment a requisite as we work towards reaching the united nations sustainable development goals particularly goal 6 clean water and sanitation that aims to increase waste water reuse gerba et al 2017 sano et al 2016 while pmmov can be considered an index virus for enteric viruses in areas with known untreated wastewater pollution sources it may not correlate with infectious enteric viruses in areas with better sanitation leading to an overestimation of the consequent risk of illness thus more research is necessary to understand the fate of infectious enteric viruses under various treatment scenarios and their correlation to pmmov however it is possible that pmmov could be an appropriate index virus for enteric viruses in environmental waters exposed to mixed treated domestic water if a pmmov threshold could be identified to distinguish likely enteric virus presence and or risk of enteric virus infection exceeding established health targets additional studies that link pmmov detection and quantification with the risk of enteric virus infection in a variety of fecal pollution contexts are needed to determine the suitability of pmmov as an index virus for enteric viruses in environmental waters exposed to mixed treated domestic wastewater pollution even though it is likely that pmmov will be equally applicable throughout africa and the middle east due to the globalization of food products and the prevalence of pmmov in agriculture the sensitivity and specificity of pmmov as a domestic wastewater tracer has yet to be investigated in these regions before pmmov is described as a universal domestic wastewater tracer in environmental waters studies are needed to confirm the absence of non fecal sources e g food processing plant effluent agricultural fields the elevated concentrations of pmmov in treated domestic wastewater provide an advantage as a domestic wastewater tracer by overcoming the methodological difficulties of false negative results which commonly occur as a result of low virus concentration and detection efficiencies gentry shields and stewart 2013 harwood et al 2013a for example pmmov was used to justify modeling the risk of hadv arv and hnov infection with virus concentrations between 0 and the limit of detection for samples with high concentrations of inhibitors an advantage that allowed for the use of qmra and informed conclusions for managing indirect wastewater reuse verbyla et al 2016 during the last decade public health related water microbiology has witnessed the rapid development of molecular based technologies which have enabled researchers to measure virus concentrations in waste water and food concomitantly these studies identified the need to replace and or complement routine fib analyses with an indicator specific to enteric viruses gerba et al 2017 li et al 2015 sano et al 2016 symonds and breitbart 2015 pmmov is a proven domestic wastewater tracer as well as promising process indicator and index virus for enteric viruses thus this virus is a worthwhile target for rapid lab free molecular based analyses to facilitate rapid microbial quality management future research on the applications of pmmov as a domestic wastewater tracer and surrogate for enteric viruses in the management of food and water quality as well as wastewater reuse will help engineers environmental scientists policymakers and other stakeholders achieve the post 2015 united nations sustainable development goals united nations 2015 united nations water 2015 8 conclusion pmmov is a useful process indicator for enteric virus removal because its high concentrations allow for measuring removal at all treatment technology scales pmmov is an appropriate index virus for enteric viruses in environmental waters exposed to untreated domestic wastewater even with known secondary treated wastewater pollution pmmov concentrations greater than 1 78 103 targets l 1 correspond to health risks exceeding the u s epa health benchmark for recreational waters further research is needed to determine if pmmov correlates with enteric viruses and the concentrations of pmmov that correspond to high human health risks in environmental waters contaminated by tertiary treated wastewater pmmov is a promising index virus to determine the microbial quality of shellfish as well as

19344,an enteric virus surrogate and reliable domestic wastewater tracer is needed to manage microbial quality of food and water as waste water reuse becomes more prevalent in response to population growth urbanization and climate change pepper mild mottle virus pmmov a plant pathogen found at high concentrations in domestic wastewater is a promising surrogate for enteric viruses that has been incorporated into over 29 water and food related microbial quality and technology investigations around the world this review consolidates the available literature from across disciplines to provide guidance on the utility of pmmov as either an enteric virus surrogate and or domestic wastewater marker in various situations synthesis of the available research supports pmmov as a useful enteric virus process indicator since its high concentrations in source water allow for identifying the extent of virus log reductions in field pilot and full scale waste water treatment systems pmmov reduction levels during many forms of wastewater treatment were less than or equal to the reduction of other viruses suggesting this virus can serve as an enteric virus surrogate when evaluating new treatment technologies pmmov excels as an index virus for enteric viruses in environmental waters exposed to untreated domestic wastewater because it was detected more frequently and in higher concentrations than other human viruses in groundwater 72 2 and surface waters freshwater 94 5 and coastal 72 2 with pathogen co detection rates as high as 72 3 additionally pmmov is an important microbial source tracking marker most appropriately associated with untreated domestic wastewater where its pooled specificity is 90 and pooled sensitivity is 100 as opposed to human feces where its pooled sensitivity is only 11 3 a limited number of studies have also suggested that pmmov may be a useful index virus for enteric viruses in monitoring the microbial quality of fresh produce and shellfish but further research is needed on these topics finally future work is needed to fill in knowledge gaps regarding pmmov s global specificity and sensitivity graphical abstract image 1 keywords domestic wastewater water reuse fecal pollution water quality indicator enteric pathogens 1 introduction domestic wastewater pollution is a major global public health concern due to the high concentrations of diverse pathogens in feces the prevalence of wastewater pollution worldwide and the important role water plays in everyday activities unicef and world health organization 2015 specifically enteric viruses are one the most problematic pathogen types and among the most important emerging waterborne pathogens because of their low infectious doses high concentrations in human feces long persistence in the environment and resistance to waste water treatment summarized in fong and lipp 2005 gerba et al 2017 lin and ganesh 2013 nwachcuku and gerba 2004 sinclair et al 2009 symonds and breitbart 2015 us national research council 2012 therefore to manage the health risks associated with wastewater pollution and achieve the united nations sustainable development goals united nations 2015 it is important to measure enteric viruses in environmental waters and waste water treatment and reuse systems directly measuring enteric viruses in water and food can be difficult and expensive consequently surrogates are often used to indirectly measure the presence of enteric viruses ashbolt et al 2001 sinclair et al 2012 in public health related microbiology a surrogate is a substance e g caffeine or microbe e g human norovirus hnov escherichia coli whose presence reflects pathogen persistence and can therefore be used to explore the risk of contamination in food and in the environment as well as the efficacy of various waste water treatment technologies with respect to human enteric pathogens microbial surrogates are divided into the following categories process indicators index or model surrogates also termed organisms reference pathogens and fecal indicators surrogates that characterize the efficacy of a specific treatment are classified as process indicators index and model surrogates are most frequently used to represent a specific pathogen type e g e coli for bacterial enteric pathogens while reference pathogens are human pathogens that are used to infer the occurrence of similar pathogens e g hnov is a reference pathogen for enteric viruses finally fecal indicators and markers refer to surrogates that identify the presence of fecal material and not necessarily the presence of a particular pathogen or group of pathogens the world health organization who recommends monitoring the microbial quality of waste water and food using indicator organisms e g fecal indicator bacteria fib bacteriophages and reference pathogens e g hnov in lieu of measuring all of the human pathogens that are possibly present world health organization 2006 2009 2010 2011 over the last four decades numerous studies have demonstrated that fib among the most frequently used and easily measured water quality parameters ashbolt et al 2001 does not correlate with or predict the presence of enteric viruses in treated waste water shellfish environmental waters and fresh produce carducci et al 2009 eregno et al 2018 fout et al 2017 gerba et al 2017 griffin et al 2001 harwood et al 2005 labelle et al 1980 li et al 2015 savichtcheva and okabe 2006 schets et al 2008 sinclair et al 2012 stewart et al 2008 symonds et al 2014 verbyla et al 2016 wu et al 2011 yates 2007 this is not surprising given the vastly different physical characteristics of fib and enteric viruses which result in disparate responses to treatment and environmental conditions an alternate surrogate for enteric viruses is therefore needed in order to better predict risk and protect human health while a variety of bacteriophages can be measured with culture based assays and are therefore affordable enteric virus surrogates to monitor fecal pollution and waste water treatment efficiency these bacteriophages do not consistently correlate with the presence of enteric viruses eregno et al 2018 fout et al 2017 lin and ganesh 2013 santiago rodriguez et al 2013 savichtcheva and okabe 2006 additionally recently identified and abundant crassphage has been proposed as a viral fecal pollution indicator dutilh et al 2014 stachler and bibby 2014 however more research is needed to understand its correlation with infectious human enteric viruses in contaminated environments and throughout wastewater treatment before crassphage can be used as an index or process enteric virus indicator garcía aljaro et al 2017 stachler et al 2017 the concentrations of some commonly used reference enteric viruses such as hnov or rotavirus group a arv vary widely based on disease epidemiology ranging from undetected to nearly 107 virus targets l 1 wastewater gerba et al 2017 kitajima et al 2014 other reference enteric viruses include human adenoviruses hadv aichiviruses haiv and polyomaviruses hpyv which are consistently measured at 104 to 107 virus targets l 1 domestic wastewater kitajima et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 however since the abundance of reference enteric viruses found in wastewater is dependent upon the extent of infection and shedding in the population their use as enteric virus surrogates to test waste water treatment technologies gerba et al 2017 kato et al 2018 li et al 2015 sano et al 2016 and manage microbial water and food quality may be limited lin and ganesh 2013 sinclair et al 2012 symonds and breitbart 2015 u s epa 2006 verbyla et al 2016 pepper mild mottle virus pmmov was first proposed as an indicator of fecal pollution for coastal sub tropical waters in 2009 rosario et al 2009b after it was identified by metagenomics as the dominant rna virus in human feces and shown by qpcr to be present at concentrations as great as 109 viral targets g 1 dry weight zhang et al 2006 since zhang et al published their study in 2006 other metagenomic studies have verified the abundance of pmmov in human feces moore et al 2015 nakamura et al 2009 victoria et al 2009 untreated domestic wastewater wang et al 2018 tertiary treated domestic wastewater rosario et al 2009a and even indoor air filters rosario et al 2018 additionally pmmov has been incorporated in over 29 peer reviewed and published investigations related to microbial water and food quality as well as waste water treatment technologies throughout the world ahmed et al 2018 asami et al 2016 betancourt et al 2014 fout et al 2017 gu et al 2018 hamza et al 2011 han et al 2014 haramoto et al 2013 hruby et al 2013 hughes et al 2017 kato et al 2018 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 lee et al 2017 rachmadi et al 2015 rosiles gonzález et al 2017 saeidi et al 2018 sangsanont et al 2016 sassi et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016 shirasaki et al 2017 2018 shrestha et al 2018 symonds et al 2014 2015 2016 2017 tandukar et al 2018 verbyla et al 2016 wang et al 2018 the main purpose of this review is to consolidate the available information from a variety of different disciplines to understand how and when pmmov can best be used as an enteric virus surrogate and or domestic wastewater marker fig 1 2 methods 2 1 literature search all published peer reviewed wastewater treatment and water quality studies using pmmov were identified via google scholar searches executed from may 2017 to may 2018 to identify these studies google scholar searches were executed using the following keywords in may 2017 fecal pollution pepper mild mottle virus and wastewater pollution at that time google scholar alerts were created for studies citing previously published pmmov related articles specifically rosario et al 2009b symonds et al 2016 symonds et al 2014 verbyla et al 2016 as well as the aforementioned keywords lastly an additional google scholar search using the same keywords was executed prior to manuscript publication in june 2018 to ensure that all peer reviewed published water quality studies using pmmov had been identified and considered in this review 2 2 pooled data calculations the data from a total of 22 peer reviewed published studies were reviewed and consolidated with respect to pmmov detection concentration and pathogen co occurrence the pooled human associated sensitivity e g the percentage of pmmov positive human fecal and domestic wastewater samples and specificity e g the percentage of pmmov negative non human fecal samples were determined by consolidating the data from 16 and three investigations respectively additionally environmental water samples from 17 different published studies were classified by water type groundwater coastal seawater and brackish water and inland freshwater and subsequently by the type of domestic wastewater contamination which was characterized as point or non point sources of untreated or treated domestic wastewater for each combination of environmental water sample type and type of domestic wastewater contamination the pooled positive pmmov detection rate pmmov minimum and maximum concentration and the pmmov pooled pathogen co occurrence rate was determined while the majority of studies specifically compared pmmov presence to that other enteric viruses several studies also included enteric parasites and bacteria thus the pooled pathogen co occurrence rate refers to the co occurrence of pmmov and any human enteric pathogen 2 3 review of the waste water treatment and water quality studies this review summarizes all the previously published and some unpublished investigations that have incorporated the use of pmmov as a fecal associated virus surrogate this manuscript begins by discussing pmmov ecology and origin in human feces next it summarizes how pmmov is identified and quantified in a variety of sample types followed by a review of pmmov occurrence and persistence in natural environments and engineered systems a more detailed discussion is included on the use of pmmov as a domestic wastewater microbial source tracking mst tool finally this review discusses the compiled and pooled data as well as identifies directions for future research 3 pepper mild mottle virus ecology and its origin in human feces pmmov is a rod shaped non enveloped positive sense single stranded rna virus approximately 18 nm in diameter and 300 310 nm in length with an isoelectric point the ph when the virus has a neutral charge ranging from 3 7 to 3 8 king et al 2011 michen and graule 2010 wetter et al 1984 belonging to the virgaviridae family and tobamovirus genus this pepper plant pathogen is transmitted via mechanical contact with contaminated soil and or seed and causes fruit malformation and leaf mosaic in capsicum species throughout asia australia europe in middle east and north and south america adkins et al 2001 ahmad et al 2015 alonso et al 1991 beczner et al 1997 çağlar et al 2013 garcia luque et al 1993 genda et al 2007 han et al 2017 ichiki et al 2009 kaur et al 2014 milošević et al 2015 oliveira et al 2010 wang et al 2006 wetter et al 1984 yu et al 2018 pmmov has a 6356 nt genome that encodes for a capsid two replication associated proteins 126 kda and 183 kda and a cell to cell movement associated protein banović đeri et al 2018 oliveira et al 2010 given the limited genetic variability of pmmov it has been suggested that the pmmov genome is highly stable rodriguez cerezo et al 1989 and limited sequence variation has been observed among geographic regions yu et al 2018 like many other plant pathogens belonging to the virgaviridae family that are found in domestic wastewater cantalupo et al 2011 pmmov has a dietary origin in human feces colson et al 2010 zhang et al 2006 in 2016 approximately 39 million tonnes of peppers were produced throughout the world food and agriculture organization of the united nations 2018 processed pepper products such as dry spices and sauces from the united states of america france mexico china and elsewhere have tested positive for pmmov and sauces can contain as many as 108 8 pmmov targets ml 1 colson et al 2010 peng et al 2015 zhang et al 2006 remarkably infectious pmmov are present in food products as well as feces colson et al 2010 peng et al 2015 zhang et al 2006 while pmmov has not been reported to replicate in the human gut scientists have hypothesized and investigated its replication in humans due to its high concentration in feces colson et al 2010 mandal and jain 2010 zhang et al 2006 and association with fever and other immune responses colson et al 2010 taken together pmmov s genetic stability and its persistence in globally distributed processed pepper products and human feces make it an attractive domestic wastewater indicator which is defined in this review as a microbe or chemical that identifies the presence of fecal material and not necessarily the presence of a particular pathogen or group of pathogens sinclair et al 2012 4 identifying and quantifying pepper mild mottle virus 4 1 virus isolation and or concentration methods nucleic acid isolation is the first step in identifying pmmov and the methods to do so vary by sample type for pepper produce in an agricultural context pmmov rna is usually isolated from either the seeds or leaves of the infected capsicum plant via mechanical disruption çağlar et al 2013 ichiki et al 2009 ikegashira et al 2004 kaur et al 2014 wang et al 2006 in processed food products domestic wastewater and feces supernatant pmmov rna is often in high enough concentrations to be directly detected colson et al 2010 peng et al 2015 symonds et al 2016 if pmmov is suspected to be in lower concentrations which is often the case in settings where fecal pollution is being measured then virus concentration methods are necessary prior to detection assays standard methods iso ts15216 1 2013 for viruses have been used to isolate and concentrate pmmov from lettuce verbyla et al 2016 and shellfish ingeborg boxman personal communication for water matrices the virus isolation and concentration methods vary by water type pmmov as well as enteric viruses in small volume samples 2 l are typically isolated using adsorption elution methods with electronegative membrane filters betancourt et al 2014 han et al 2014 kato et al 2018 kitajima et al 2014 sangsanont et al 2016 sassi et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 tandukar et al 2018 which is sometimes followed by the concentration of the eluent using peg precipitation hamza et al 2011 or centrifugal filter concentrators asami et al 2016 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 lee et al 2017 rachmadi et al 2015 sangsanont et al 2016 sassi et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016 tandukar et al 2018 alternatively it is possible to directly purify virus nucleic acids from the electronegative membrane filter used in the adsorption elution methods ahmed et al 2018 hughes et al 2017 symonds et al 2014 2017 verbyla et al 2016 centrifugal filter concentrators have also been used to directly concentrate smaller volumes 20 ml of waste water when high virus concentrations were anticipated rosario et al 2009b symonds et al 2015 viruses including pmmov in higher volume samples 30 l typically used to test groundwater and potable water have been concentrated with nanoceram filters betancourt et al 2014 glass wool filters hruby et al 2013 cartridge mixed cellulose ester filters kuroda et al 2015 and hollow fiber ultrafilters gu et al 2018 mcginnis et al 2018 rosiles gonzález et al 2017 since all of the aforementioned virus concentration methods have been developed for enteric viruses that have a different capsid structure compared to pmmov future investigations should ensure that pmmov is similarly concentrated haramoto et al 2018 the theoretical process limit of detection which assumes 100 recovery of pmmov cdna from the original volume samples is often not reported however it can be as low as 4 28 targets l 1 when 1000 l volumes are concentrated hruby et al 2013 and as high as 1000 targets l 1 when 50 ml volumes are concentrated shrestha et al 2018 the use of process controls which is usually a virus similar to the enteric reference virus analyzed is necessary to ensure effective virus concentration and detection haramoto et al 2018 recently one study incorporated cucumber green mottle mosaic virus also belonging to the tobamovirus genus as a virus concentration process control for pmmov kato et al 2018 4 2 detection and quantification methods while pmmov like particles can be visualized using electron microscopy colson et al 2010 peng et al 2015 pmmov is most frequently detected using either molecular or immunological based methods in agriculture çağlar et al 2013 ikegashira et al 2004 kaur et al 2014 wang et al 2006 rapid lab free immunological based tests designed for agricultural contexts are available to test leaf tissue or seeds for pmmov immunostrip agdia elkhart in usa reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction rt pcr beczner et al 1997 çağlar et al 2013 kaur et al 2014 milošević et al 2015 wang et al 2006 is frequently used to identify pmmov and the complete genomes of several strains have been sequenced alonso et al 1991 avila rincon et al 1989 garcia luque et al 1990 hagiwara et al 2002 oliveira et al 2010 velasco et al 2002 wang et al 2006 in contrast to agriculture molecular based methods are primarily used for detecting pmmov in microbial water and food quality contexts hamza et al 2011 haramoto et al 2013 rosario et al 2009b zhang et al 2006 and methods have even been created to discriminate between infectious and non infectious pmmov particles lee et al 2018 in fecal pollution studies rt pcr and rt quantitative pcr rt qpcr are the most common forms of molecular detection and quantification of pmmov a variety of rna purification kits have been used successfully with the most appropriate kit dependent on the sample type asami et al 2016 betancourt et al 2014 colson et al 2010 haramoto et al 2013 symonds et al 2014 2015 2016 2017 verbyla et al 2016 reverse transcription is generally executed as a two step process in which purified rna is reversed transcribed with random hexamer primers using the first strand synthesis superscript iii reverse transcription kit invitrogen carlsbad ca usa ahmed et al 2018 hughes et al 2017 rosario et al 2009b rosiles gonzález et al 2017 symonds et al 2015 symonds et

et al 2013 kato et al 2018 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 lee et al 2017 rachmadi et al 2015 sassi et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016 shirasaki et al 2017 shirasaki et al 2018 shrestha et al 2018 tandukar et al 2018 less frequently a one step rt approach has been taken using the quantitect probe one step rt pcr kit qiagen hilden germany hamza et al 2011 or the superscript iii platinum one step quantitative rt pcr system life technologies carlsbad ca usa colson et al 2010 several endpoint rt pcr and rt qpcr assays have been developed which target either the pmmov capsid or replication associated proteins table 1 although some of the pcr assays were developed for infected capsicum specimens haramoto et al 2013 and rosiles gonzález et al 2017 have used these assays for water matrices çağlar et al 2013 and processed food products peng et al 2015 respectively additionally the pcr assay developed by zhang et al 2006 has also been used to test feces and waste water matrices symonds et al 2017 with respect to quantitative methods hamza et al 2011 created a sybr based rt qpcr assay with a reported detection limit of 5 targets the pmmov hydrolysis qpcr assay which is preceded by a separate rt reaction was originally designed by zhang et al 2006 and then the forward primer was modified by the addition of a thymine nucleotide to better match pmmov isolates haramoto et al 2013 five years ago haramoto et al 2013 replaced the tamra quencher with a minor groove binding nonfluorescent quencher mgbnfq this modification lowered the limit of quantification from 100 targets to 10 targets while many papers have utilized the zhang et al 2006 primers and probes ahmed et al 2018 colson et al 2010 hruby et al 2013 hughes et al 2017 peng et al 2015 rosario et al 2009b sangsanont et al 2016 symonds et al 2014 most recent papers have used the pmmv fp1 rev and pmmv rp1 primers with the pmmv taqman mgb probe or equivalent type of probe asami et al 2016 betancourt et al 2014 gu et al 2018 haramoto et al 2013 kato et al 2018 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 lee et al 2017 2018 rachmadi et al 2015 rosiles gonzález et al 2017 saeidi et al 2018 sassi et al 2018 schmitz et al 2016 shirasaki et al 2017 2018 shrestha et al 2018 symonds et al 2015 2016 2017 tandukar et al 2018 verbyla et al 2016 5 occurrence and persistence in natural environments and engineered systems 5 1 domestic wastewater and treatment since people consume food products cultivated and produced from around the world it is reasonable to believe that pmmov will be found in domestic wastewater worldwide however studies are lacking to prove this assertion to date pmmov has been detected in domestic wastewater from australia hughes et al 2017 bolivia symonds et al 2014 brasil verbyla symonds unpublished data costa rica symonds et al 2017 germany hamza et al 2011 guatemala symonds breitbart unpublished data japan lee et al 2017 kenya nicolette zhou scott meschke personal communication nepal shrestha et al 2018 south korea han et al 2014 the united states of america u s kitajima et al 2014 rosario et al 2009b schmitz et al 2016 and vietnam kuroda et al 2015 pmmov is typically found at concentrations ranging from 106 to 1010 targets l 1 in untreated domestic wastewater table 2 pmmov abundance in domestic wastewater did not significantly vary when measured daily for two weeks rosario et al 2009b nor monthly for one year kitajima et al 2014 additionally pmmov is consistently more abundant than other human enteric viruses and proposed virus surrogates in domestic wastewater bofill mas et al 2006 carducci et al 2009 jothikumar et al 2005 kitajima et al 2014 laverick et al 2004 schmitz et al 2016 symonds et al 2014 2017 the consistently high concentrations of pmmov in untreated domestic wastewater make it a good candidate as an index virus for enteric viruses in polluted environmental waters produce and shellfish as well as a process indicator for measuring enteric virus removal during waste water treatment and water reclamation in full scale domestic wastewater effluent pmmov has been consistently found in concentrations ranging from 101 109 targets l 1 table 2 with reduction levels less than or equal to the reduction of other viruses hamza et al 2011 hughes et al 2017 kitajima et al 2014 kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009b schmitz et al 2016 shrestha et al 2018 symonds et al 2014 to date a benchtop electrocoagulation unit is the only wastewater treatment technology that has demonstrated pmmov reductions to concentrations below the limit of detection corresponding to reductions as great as 5 log10 symonds et al 2015 the greatest pmmov target reductions on full scale systems were observed at two u s wastewater treatment plants wwtps using advanced bardenpho technologies in which pmmov targets were reduced as great as 4 log10 and coincided with greater human virus reductions schmitz et al 2016 for a conventional activated sludge system in germany approximately 3 log10 pmmov target reduction was observed which was similar to reductions of hpyv torque teno virus and slightly greater than culturable somatic coliphage hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009b determined similar log10 reductions for some conventional activated sludge systems with disinfection in the u s however one third of the systems analyzed had as 1 log10 pmmov target reductions several other studies analyzing a variety of full scale domestic wwtps also demonstrated approximately 1 log10 pmmov reductions at an australian activated sludge wwtp with disinfection a 1 1 log10 pmmov target reduction was observed which was approximately 2 log10 less than the reduction of hadv and hpyv hnov and hev reductions were slightly greater 2 log10 than those observed for pmmov hughes et al 2017 similarly pmmov and hadv had 1 log10 target reductions at a sequential batch reactor wwtp in vietnam kuroda et al 2015 in two wastewater treatment pond systems in bolivia symonds et al 2014 also observed 1 log10 pmmov hnov and arv reductions however culturable human enteroviruses hev were reduced by 1 log10 in two other studies on virus reduction during activated sludge and biological trickling filter pmmov had 1 log10 reductions which was similar to haiv and coincided with minimum reductions in hnov sapovirus hsav hev hadv hpyv and arv kitajima et al 2014 schmitz et al 2016 5 2 drinking water treatment and reclamation systems the consistently high pmmov concentrations present in domestic wastewater make pmmov a potential process indicator of enteric virus removal in drinking water treatment and reclamation systems currently pmmov has been incorporated into seven investigations researching the viral log reduction in point of use sangsanont et al 2016 as well as drinking water treatment plant technologies e g coagulation rapid sand filtration membrane filtration asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 lee et al 2017 shirasaki et al 2017 shirasaki et al 2018 unlike hadv haiv hev and f specific coliphage pmmov was the only waterborne virus detected in drinking water sources e g pond and tapwater prior to point of use treatment in a study executed in vietnam thus pmmov was an essential enteric virus process indicator during point of use field testing sangsanont et al 2016 in addition laboratory testing determined that the log removal of pmmov was comparable to that of hadv and haiv and less than hev sangsanont et al 2016 pmmov was also a useful process indicator of enteric viruses in a pilot scale treatment plant as well as full scale drinking water treatment plants due to its consistently high concentrations in source water in japan kato et al 2018 lee et al 2017 and thailand asami et al 2016 in addition to its high concentrations in source water pmmov removal was similar to that of human viral pathogens of interest and rarely overestimated removal of these viruses by the drinking water treatment technologies tested to date asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 lee et al 2017 shirasaki et al 2017 2018 no correlation was identified between human viral pathogens and fib in source water and post treatment waters fib had greater log removal than that of pmmov and other viruses asami et al 2016 kato et al 2018 sangsanont et al 2016 pmmov removal was most significantly positively correlated with the removal of hadv hav murine nov mnv haiv hnovgii and human coxsackieviruses hcv via coagulation rapid sand filtration as well as via membrane filtration processes thus it is a more appropriate process indicator of viral removal in comparison to bacteriophages ms2 and φx174 which did not correlate as well with human viral pathogens kato et al 2018 shirasaki et al 2017 2018 in another study on ultrafiltration with coagulation sedimentation virus removal pmmov removal rates were also similar to human enteric viruses hnov and haiv however only culturable bacteriophage demonstrated additional virus removal when coagulation sedimentation was combined with ultrafiltration lee et al 2017 despite pmmov s utility as an enteric virus removal process indicator it is possible that pmmov may need to be combined with a culturable assay or another type of selective treatment for infectious particles e g lee et al 2018 in order to effectively measure virus inactivation during treatment 5 3 contaminated surface waters since pmmov was first proposed as an indicator of fecal pollution this virus has been incorporated into 16 published studies analyzing microbial quality of freshwater brackish waters and seawater with and without known sources of domestic wastewater pollution in australia hughes et al 2017 bolivia verbyla et al 2016 costa rica symonds et al 2017 germany hamza et al 2011 japan haramoto et al 2013 mexico rosiles gonzález et al 2017 nepal shrestha et al 2018 tandukar et al 2018 singapore gu et al 2018 saeidi et al 2018 u s betancourt et al 2014 mcginnis et al 2018 rosario et al 2009b sassi et al 2018 symonds et al 2016 and vietnam kuroda et al 2015 it is important to note that pmmov has not been detected in environmental waters in the absence of human fecal pollution and that pmmov rna persisted in seawater for approximately 1 week at temperatures ranging from 31 to 33 c and in river water for approximately 10 days at 25 c and as long as 21 days at 4 c hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009b the persistence of pmmov in surface freshwater was comparable to caffeine in surface freshwater contaminated with known point sources of domestic wastewater kuroda et al 2015 additionally pmmov detection exceeded the detection of other enteric viruses in rivers contaminated by domestic wastewater treatment effluent and was detected as far as 32 km downstream from the discharge pipe sassi et al 2018 pmmov did not significantly correlate with fib in coastal waters hughes et al 2017 symonds et al 2016 2017 or inland freshwater hamza et al 2011 mcginnis et al 2018 symonds et al 2016 however one study in singapore identified significant positive correlations between pmmov and the fib enterococci and e coli in fresh surface waters saeidi et al 2018 pmmov concentrations were also correlated with residential and green areas in singapore saeidi et al 2018 in coastal waters pmmov was detected in 72 2 52 9 and 11 4 of surface water samples exposed to ocean outfalls discharging secondary treated chlorinated domestic waster known non point domestic wastewater sources and possible but unconfirmed domestic wastewater pollution respectively table 3 hughes et al 2017 rosario et al 2009b symonds et al 2016 2017 sixty one percent of coastal water samples exposed to ocean outfalls discharging secondary treated and chlorinated domestic wastewater were positive for both pmmov and at least one human pathogen e g hpyv hnov hadv hev and this percentage decreased to 0 as the extent of known domestic wastewater pollution decreased table 3 in coastal waters without known domestic wastewater pollution it is possible that pmmov may persist for longer periods of time in comparison to other enteric viruses because pmmov concentrations were quantified at 104 targets l 1 with a 0 pathogen co occurrence however care is needed when making this observation since the sample size was limited to just five positive samples in coastal waters exposed to point and non point domestic wastewater pollution pmmov exhibited a significant positive correlation with the human associated mst markers bacteroides hf183 and hpyv symonds et al 2016 however in coastal waters exposed to stormwater runoff pmmov did not co occur with bacteroides hf183 which was present more often and in greater concentrations hughes et al 2017 initially it was thought that pmmov may be an ultraconservative fecal pollution indicator due to its persistence throughout wastewater treatment hamza et al 2011 kuroda et al 2015 rosario et al 2009b sassi et al 2018 however recent coastal fecal pollution studies have shown that pmmov detection appropriately relates to risk of illness ahmed et al 2018 hughes et al 2017 symonds et al 2016 for example two of these investigations on the pmmov process limits of detection and quantification demonstrated that the mere detection of pmmov in coastal water samples seeded with untreated and secondary treated domestic wastewater corresponded to health risks of hnov and hadv infection exceeding the united states of america environmental protection agency u s epa health benchmark 36 1000 people for safe recreation ahmed et al 2018 symonds et al 2016 specifically 5 44 103 pmmov targets l 1 corresponded to the health benchmark for hnov and hadv illness when coastal water was contaminated with untreated domestic wastewater ahmed et al 2018 for coastal water contaminated with secondary treated domestic wastewater 2 00 104 pmmov targets l 1 and 1 78 103 pmmov targets l 1 corresponded to the health benchmark for hnov and hadv respectively the health risks of hnov and hadv infection associated with detectable and quantifiable pmmov concentrations per untreated and secondary treated domestic wastewater pollution were similar to those previously identified for other human associated fecal markers however hf183 was more sensitive and was able to identify contamination below the health benchmark ahmed et al 2018 boehm et al 2015 staley et al 2012 symonds et al 2016 in comparison to hpyv pmmov may be a more sensitive index virus for enteric viruses because the hpyv limit of detection and quantification corresponded to health risks exceeding the u s epa health benchmark ahmed et al 2018 staley et al 2012 moving inland to freshwater systems pmmov was detected in 90 8 86 3 and 67 5 of river creek canal and pond surface waters exposed to point sources of untreated domestic wastewater secondary treated domestic wastewater and unknown sources respectively table 3 pmmov co detection with human pathogens in inland freshwater systems exposed to point source pollution was 72 3 when domestic wastewater was not treated and 67 5 when it was treated these co detection rates are greater than those observed for coastal seawater and groundwater additionally pmmov significantly correlated with enteric viruses and hpyv even though it was more prevalent in microbial water quality investigations in germany hamza et al 2011 and nepal tandukar et al 2018 despite similar co detection rates of pmmov and human pathogens in systems receiving treated versus untreated wastewater pmmov concentrations were greatest in surface freshwater exposed to untreated domestic wastewater which includes studies executed in regions lacking sanitation kuroda et al 2015 shrestha et al 2018 verbyla et al 2016 as well as those exposed to combined sewer overflows csos mcginnis et al 2018 unlike the studies executed in areas lacking sanitation cso creek water had the lowest pmmov concentrations and only 57 of cso creek water samples positive for pmmov were also positive for at least one of the following pathogens hadv hev hnov gi hnov gii campylobacter jejuni enterohemorrhagic e coli and salmonella mcginnis et al 2018 interestingly pmmov and human marker bacteroides hf183 were detected in all creek water samples collected for this study despite problems with rt qpcr inhibition 5 4 groundwater pmmov has been integrated into five groundwater studies in north america and asia pmmov was detected in 72 2 and 35 3 of groundwater samples collected from areas with known point source and non point source domestic wastewater pollution respectively in concentrations ranging from 0 4 to 1 00 107 targets l 1 table 3 the first groundwater fecal pollution study to include pmmov was executed in iowa u s and only 22 of the wells sampled n 66 tested positive for at least one fecal associated microorganism hruby et al 2013 pmmov was the most frequently detected microbial target found in 17 of samples however no correlation was identified between pmmov and any of the microbial indicators e coli enterococci total coliforms male specific and somatic coliphages or pathogens hnov hadv hpyv bovine polyomavirus swine hepatitis e salmonella campylobacter and enterohemorrhagic e coli in another study groundwater collected near managed aquifer recharge sites in the u s more frequently contained pmmov which often co occurred with the presence of pathogens betancourt et al 2014 outside of the u s pmmov was found in only 38 of samples n 8 while total coliforms and e coli were found in 78 and 11 respectively in vietnam kuroda et al 2015 in an area with extensive domestic wastewater pollution in nepal pmmov and tobacco mosaic virus were detected in 83 of groundwater samples n 6 while hnov was only found in one sample and hsav hev haiv hadv hpyv and arv were not detected shrestha et al 2018 in the northeastern yucatan peninsula aquifer system in mexico pmmov was detected in 85 of sinkhole samples mixture of fresh and brackish water n 20 while coliphages were found in 80 of samples and total coliforms exceeded concentrations of 770 mpn 100 ml in 100 of samples rosiles gonzález et al 2017 no correlation was identified between pmmov and coliphages total coliforms or e coli in this study unfortunately no pathogens were analyzed given the limited sample size and number of investigations and the difficulties measuring enteric viruses in groundwater the correlation and co detection of pmmov and various pathogens in groundwater remains to be determined table 3 nevertheless pmmov appears to be a conservative surrogate for enteric viruses in groundwater given its presence in greater concentrations compared to human viruses betancourt et al 2014 hruby et al 2013 kuroda et al 2015 shrestha et al 2018 5 5 bottled water and food safety the use of pmmov as an indicator of microbial quality in food and bottled water has yet to be fully explored in a study comparing pmmov and pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps as tracers of fecal pollution in a watershed pmmov was not identified in bottled water n 3 despite the occurrence of ppcps n 2 fib n 1 and or hadv n 1 kuroda et al 2015 based upon this study it appears that pmmov could underestimate and ppcps could overestimate the extent of fecal pollution in bottled water pmmov has also been used in two studies investigating microbial quality of irrigation water in which it was detected more frequently than human viral pathogens shrestha et al 2018 verbyla et al 2016 only verbyla et al 2016 measured crop microbial quality and demonstrated that pmmov may be a conservative enteric virus surrogate to manage the microbial quality of crops irrigated with wastewater contaminated water sources future studies are needed to ascertain the role of pmmov as an enteric virus surrogate in these contexts to date pmmov has only been incorporated into one investigation on shellfish microbial quality which has not been published previously ingeborg boxman personal communication in a dutch program 2008 2009 monitoring shellfish on the dutch market and directly collected from european harvesting areas viruses were isolated from shellfish samples using standard methods iso ts15216 1 2013 pmmov was detected in a higher percentage of oyster and mussel samples than nov with both viruses assayed by rt qpcr pmmov and nov were detected in 65 75 115 and 18 21 115 of the oyster samples respectively whereas pmmov and nov were detected in 74 64 86 and 42 36 86 of the mussels sampled out of the nov positive shellfish samples pmmov co occurred with nov in 86 18 21 of oysters and 92 33 36 of mussels out of the pmmov positive shellfish samples tested nov co occurred in 24 18 75 of oysters and 52 33 64 of mussels thus pmmov shows promise as a conservative viral indicator of microbial quality in shellfish future studies are needed to understand how pmmov depuration and retention rates compare with pathogens of interest 6 pepper mild mottle virus as a domestic wastewater microbial source tracking marker mst was developed to discriminate between human and wildlife sources of fecal pollution in water bodies mst markers aim to target genes of microbes that are specific to the host species specificity and prevalent within the host species sensitivity as summarized in harwood et al 2013b identifying genes of human associated bacteria and viruses are of particular interest because sewage pollution poses a greater threat to human health than wildlife sources generally harwood et al 2013b soller et al 2010 stoeckel and harwood 2007 the most routinely used human associated markers include hf183 hpyv humm2 and humm3 summarized in harwood et al 2013b these and other human associated markers are often used in conjunction with wildlife markers to characterize fecal contamination in impaired water bodies mst methodologies ultimately help identify dominant sources of fecal contamination leading to more informed water quality assessment and targeted remediation practices pmmov has been utilized in many fecal pollution studies but only three studies to date have specifically assessed its potential as a domestic wastewater marker by testing for specificity i e the ratio of pmmov positive non human feces samples to total non human feces tested in fecal samples from chickens cows dogs horses pigs seabirds and other organisms table 4 hamza et al 2011 rosario et al 2009b symonds et al 2017 while specificity testing across non target organisms remains geographically limited to costa rica germany and the u s sensitivity testing has occurred with numerous types of domestic wastewater samples across ten countries pmmov sensitivity across numerous studies was 97 9 n 446 in domestic wastewater and or effluent undergoing different treatments river water exposed to wwtp effluent and surface water exposed to untreated wastewater tables 2 and 3 the specificity and sensitivity of pmmov as a domestic wastewater associated marker are similar to those of hf183 hpyv humm2 humm3 and other human associated mst markers summarized in harwood et al 2013b similar to other markers one potential limitation of pmmov for mst is its lower specificity due to cross reactivity with chicken seagull goose and cow feces where pmmov can be detected at the same concentration range as human feces thus pmmov may not be a suitable marker in areas where these animals are prevalent table 4 additionally pmmov was not always present at detectable levels in individual fecal samples from children and adults which were mostly collected in france table 2 pmmov s sensitivity in human feces is only slightly lower than that reported for hpyv and some bacteroidales assays harwood et al 2013b and it is possible that pmmov may be more frequently encountered in regions that consume more processed pepper products to obtain a clearer global specificity value we recommend specificity testing with non target organisms across a wider geographic range despite these limitations our meta analysis suggests that pmmov currently has a specificity of 90 0 n 150 and sensitivity ranging from 11 3 n 478 human feces only to 100 n 126 untreated domestic wastewater only thus it is more appropriate to consider pmmov a domestic wastewater associated marker than a human fecal marker overall the concomitant presence of pmmov in domestic wastewater effluent and water sources exposed to different effluent sources suggests that pmmov is mostly human specific and should be incorporated into the mst toolbox for use as a domestic wastewater marker the utility of pmmov as a tool for mst was exemplified in an investigation of the reedy creek watershed kissimmee fl u s in which the absence of pmmov confirmed that the high fib concentrations were from natural sources e g wildlife vegetation and not from the water reclamation facility young et al 2014 nguyen et al in review while hf183 typically a domestic wastewater marker was measured in this study it could not serve as a domestic wastewater marker since it was identified in natural sources as well as deer feces nguyen et al in review this study highlights the need to have multiple domestic wastewater markers available for mst finally caution needs to be used when applying pmmov as a pollution marker in areas where pepper processing occurrs as well as in areas irrigating with reclaimed water e g tertiary treated and disinfected wastewater 7 discussion this comprehensive review indicates that pmmov can be used to inform microbial water quality and shows potential to characterize the microbial quality of fresh produce and shellfish cultivated in or with environmental waters in the americas australia asia and europe our synthesis of the available literature supports pmmov as a useful enteric virus process indicator to evaluate waste water treatment technologies and a unique and important process indicator to measure virus removal in full scale systems even though pmmov removal and reduction did not always coincide with all enteric viruses or culturable virus indicators pmmov frequently co occurred with pathogens of interest furthermore pmmov s naturally high concentrations in wastewater were essential for determining the degree and mechanisms of viral reduction during full scale treatment a requisite as we work towards reaching the united nations sustainable development goals particularly goal 6 clean water and sanitation that aims to increase waste water reuse gerba et al 2017 sano et al 2016 while pmmov can be considered an index virus for enteric viruses in areas with known untreated wastewater pollution sources it may not correlate with infectious enteric viruses in areas with better sanitation leading to an overestimation of the consequent risk of illness thus more research is necessary to understand the fate of infectious enteric viruses under various treatment scenarios and their correlation to pmmov however it is possible that pmmov could be an appropriate index virus for enteric viruses in environmental waters exposed to mixed treated domestic water if a pmmov threshold could be identified to distinguish likely enteric virus presence and or risk of enteric virus infection exceeding established health targets additional studies that link pmmov detection and quantification with the risk of enteric virus infection in a variety of fecal pollution contexts are needed to determine the suitability of pmmov as an index virus for enteric viruses in environmental waters exposed to mixed treated domestic wastewater pollution even though it is likely that pmmov will be equally applicable throughout africa and the middle east due to the globalization of food products and the prevalence of pmmov in agriculture the sensitivity and specificity of pmmov as a domestic wastewater tracer has yet to be investigated in these regions before pmmov is described as a universal domestic wastewater tracer in environmental waters studies are needed to confirm the absence of non fecal sources e g food processing plant effluent agricultural fields the elevated concentrations of pmmov in treated domestic wastewater provide an advantage as a domestic wastewater tracer by overcoming the methodological difficulties of false negative results which commonly occur as a result of low virus concentration and detection efficiencies gentry shields and stewart 2013 harwood et al 2013a for example pmmov was used to justify modeling the risk of hadv arv and hnov infection with virus concentrations between 0 and the limit of detection for samples with high concentrations of inhibitors an advantage that allowed for the use of qmra and informed conclusions for managing indirect wastewater reuse verbyla et al 2016 during the last decade public health related water microbiology has witnessed the rapid development of molecular based technologies which have enabled researchers to measure virus concentrations in waste water and food concomitantly these studies identified the need to replace and or complement routine fib analyses with an indicator specific to enteric viruses gerba et al 2017 li et al 2015 sano et al 2016 symonds and breitbart 2015 pmmov is a proven domestic wastewater tracer as well as promising process indicator and index virus for enteric viruses thus this virus is a worthwhile target for rapid lab free molecular based analyses to facilitate rapid microbial quality management future research on the applications of pmmov as a domestic wastewater tracer and surrogate for enteric viruses in the management of food and water quality as well as wastewater reuse will help engineers environmental scientists policymakers and other stakeholders achieve the post 2015 united nations sustainable development goals united nations 2015 united nations water 2015 8 conclusion pmmov is a useful process indicator for enteric virus removal because its high concentrations allow for measuring removal at all treatment technology scales pmmov is an appropriate index virus for enteric viruses in environmental waters exposed to untreated domestic wastewater even with known secondary treated wastewater pollution pmmov concentrations greater than 1 78 103 targets l 1 correspond to health risks exceeding the u s epa health benchmark for recreational waters further research is needed to determine if pmmov correlates with enteric viruses and the concentrations of pmmov that correspond to high human health risks in environmental waters contaminated by tertiary treated wastewater pmmov is a promising index virus to determine the microbial quality of shellfish as well as
