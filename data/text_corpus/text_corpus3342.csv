16710,1h benzotriazole is part of a larger family of benzotriazoles which are widely used as lubricants polymer stabilizers corrosion inhibitors and anti icing fluid components it is frequently detected in urban runoff wastewater and receiving aquatic environments 1h benzotriazole is typically resistant to biodegradation and hydrolysis but can be transformed via direct photolysis and photoinduced mechanisms in this study the phototransformation mechanisms of 1h benzotriazole were characterized using multi element compound specific isotope analysis csia the kinetics transformation products and isotope fractionation results altogether revealed that 1h benzotriazole direct photolysis and indirect photolysis induced by oh radicals involved two alternative pathways in indirect photolysis aromatic hydroxylation dominated and was associated with small carbon εc 0 65 0 03 moderate hydrogen εh 21 6 and negligible nitrogen isotope enrichment factors and led to hydroxylated forms of benzotriazole in direct photolysis of 1h benzotriazole significant nitrogen εn 8 4 0 4 to 4 2 0 3 and carbon εc 4 3 0 2 to 1 64 0 04 isotope enrichment factors indicated an initial n n bond cleavage followed by nitrogen elimination with a c n bond cleavage the results of this study highlight the potential for multi element csia application to track 1h benzotriazole degradation in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photodegradation water quality stable isotopes oh radicals benzotriazole 1 introduction 1h benzotriazole c6h5n3 is widely used as corrosion inhibitor photographic restrainer and chemical intermediate for producing various chemicals its antifreeze and anticorrosion properties make it a common component of vehicle fluids 1h benzotriazole is therefore frequently detected in aquatic environments wastewater treatment plant effluents and urban stormwater runoff loos et al 2010 parajulee et al 2017 however despite its endocrine disrupting effects in fish liang et al 2014 and exposure to human baduel et al 2019 almost no countries have regulated 1h benzotriazole and its environmental fate is still poorly known 1h benzotriazole has weak adsorption properties onto soil and hardwood mulch surfaces hart et al 2004 rhodes dicker and passeport 2019 and is relatively resistant to biodegradation long half lives at 114 and 315 days under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively were estimated from activated sludge microcosm experiments liu et al 2011 as a consequence 1h benzotriazole is only partly removed in wastewater treatment plants voutsa et al 2006 and finds its way towards aquatic environments giger et al 2006 herrero et al 2014 lai et al 2014 hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolysable functional groups lyman et al 1990 finally 1h benzotriazole is expected to undergo photolysis in surface water environments borowska et al 2016 felis et al 2016 serdechnova et al 2014 wang et al 2000 the photolysis of organic compounds which can occur via direct and indirect processes is an important degradation pathway naturally occurring in surface waters and the atmosphere the direct photolysis rate of 1h benzotriazole is ph dependent as 1h benzotriazole dissociates to an anionic form at ph greater than its pka at 8 2 8 6 that is less reactive with light than its non ionic form andreozzi et al 1998 previous studies have shown that the transformation rate of 1h benzotriazole increases slightly in the presence of dissolved organic matter chung et al 2018 janssen et al 2015 assessing the relative contribution of the different reaction pathways is important to characterize 1h benzotriazole fate in aquatic ecosystems and predict the formation of potentially toxic transformation products however it is difficult due to the challenges associated with the identification of transformation products e g lack of standard materials and the apportionment of transformation products to different reaction pathways for instance aromatic monohydroxylation resulting in the formation of hydroxybenzotriazole has been proposed as the predominant step during both biotransformation huntscha et al 2014 and phototransformation of 1h benzotriazole in uv and uv h2o2 systems borowska et al 2016 compound specific isotope analysis csia is a promising tool to track and quantify contaminant transformation in the environment elsner and imfeld 2016 csia is mainly used to identify and quantify in situ the transformation of traditional contaminants such as hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents at groundwater contaminated sites hunkeler et al 2009 nijenhuis and richnow 2016 vogt et al 2016 it is based on the principle that molecules containing light isotopes e g 12c react faster than those with heavy isotopes e g 13c leading to kinetic isotope fractionation in bio chemical processes involving bond cleavage reactions bigeleisen and wolfsberg 1957 due to its highly reaction specific isotope fractionation patterns csia can provide direct evidence of contaminant transformation and has the potential to provide insights into transformation mechanisms without identifying transformation products hofstetter et al 2008 in addition measuring changes of isotope composition of more than one element can help identify the relative contributions of different reaction mechanisms recently csia has been proposed for characterizing the transformation processes of more emerging micropollutants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals birkigt et al 2015 fenner et al 2013 milosevic et al 2013 wu et al 2018 and for investigating the abiotic transformation mechanisms such as hydrolysis masbou et al 2018 wu et al 2017 photolysis passeport et al 2018 ratti et al 2015 wu et al 2018 and radical oxidation liu et al 2018 willach et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 of organic compounds csia has been applied in one study so far to assess 1h benzotriazole biotransformation in activated sludge huntscha et al 2014 the authors reported small isotope enrichment factors for carbon ε c and nitrogen ε n at 1 9 0 1 and 1 1 0 2 respectively however no research has explored the kinetic isotope effects of 1h benzotriazole during phototransformation thus hindering the application of csia to identify and quantify 1h benzotriazole phototransformation mechanisms in surface water the aim of the present study was to characterize the aqueous phototransformation mechanisms of 1h benzotriazole by applying three dimensional csia and product identification the specific objectives were i to evaluate reaction kinetic rate constants for aqueous phototransformation of 1h benzotriazole as a function of ph ii to develop analytical methods of 13c 2h and 15n csia for 1h benzotriazole iii to derive reference carbon εc hydrogen εh and nitrogen εn isotope enrichment factors during aqueous phototransformation of 1h benzotriazole and iv to identify phototransformation mechanisms of 1h benzotriazole using c n and c h dual isotope plots and transformation product identification 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 1h benzotriazole bt0 purity 98 0 used for phototransformation

equipped with a liquid optical filter model 6214 including a fused silica window to transmit down to 250 nm newport as the light source similar to those described elsewhere bergquist and blum 2007 ten ml of 1h benzotriazole stock solution 2000 mg l in milli q water were mixed with 990 ml of phosphate buffer 10 mm in an amber glass bottle reaching an initial concentration of 20 mg l 168 µm the solution was transferred to the quartz reactor after adjusting to the desired ph and then was continuously mixed on a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm during the experiment and maintained at constant room

among experiments at different time intervals 1 5 ml of reaction solution was taken for concentration measurement and 60 ml of reaction solution was saved for isotope composition measurement after solid phase extraction dark control experiments at different ph values were conducted in 200 ml amber glass bottle under the same condition 2 2 2 indirect phototransformation using uv h2o2 because the ph has no effect on the reaction of oh radicals with 1h benzotriazole borowska et al 2016 the indirect photolysis experiments using uv h2o2 were conducted at neutral condition due to the unavailability of the photochemical reaction setup described above a photochemical reactor system consisting of a 2 l pyrex cylindrical flask with a quartz window and a 150 w xenon lamp as the light source type l2175 wavelength 185 2000 nm hamamatsu japan were applied for the indirect photolysis experiment and its corresponding control experiments the experiments were performed under the same conditions as described above for direct photolysis except that the reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 h2o2 into the solution to reach an initial molar ratio of 1 200 for 1h benzotriazole and h2o2 control experiments were conducted with 1h benzotriazole at ph 7 with 1 uv irradiation only uv without h2o2 2 addition of h2o2 but no uv irradiation dark control and 3 uv h2o2 and a 280 nm longpass filter 2 3 sample preparation by solid phase extraction oasis hlb cartridges 6 ml cartridges 200 mg waters milford ma usa were chosen for solid phase extraction of 1h benzotriazole prior to

nitrogen stream to 1 ml or to 100 μl if needed and stored at 4 c until measurement without further pre treatment before analysis the average recovery rate was 96 1 and the observed shifts in stable

diethylaniline and seven potential biotransformation products including 1 methylbenzotriazole 4 methoxybenzotriazole 5 methoxybenzotriazole phenol dimethyl benzylamine carbazole phthalic acid were targeted in the present study as they are the most commonly found transformation products for 1h benzotriazole 4 and 5 hydroxybenzotriazole isomers could not be separated by orbitrap analysis therefore we referred to both isomers as hydroxybenzotriazole the limits of detection lod and quantification loq were determined from the linear calibration curves by running a series of concentration standards using the standard deviation of the concentration response σ and the slope s of the calibration curve using the following equations lod 3 3 σ s and loq 10 σ s the loq for the detected tps were 0 20 μmol l for hydroxybenzotriazole 0 55 μmol l for aniline 0 38 μmol l for 3 aminophenol 0 16 μmol l for phenazine 1 39 μmol l for 1 6 phenazinediol and 0 005 μmol l for phthalic acid all other details are provided in table s5 2 5 data analysis the first order kinetic constants k and the isotope enrichment factors ε were obtained from direct fitting of the first order kinetics model and the rayleigh equation eq 1 mariotti et al 1981 respectively to the data using non linear regression eq 1 h e l e t h e l e 0 f t ε where he le t and he le 0 are the stable isotope ratios of element e in 1h benzotriazole at time t and 0 respectively and f t is the fraction of remaining 1h benzotriazole at time t data points at later stages of the reaction when less than 20 of 1h benzotriazole was left were not used to fit the rayleigh model this is because the largest changes in isotope composition occur in these later stages of the reaction when the uncertainty in f is also the largest bigeleisen and allen 1951 mundle et al 2016 no correction for repetitive sampling was needed as 1h benzotriazole is poorly volatile estimated henry s law constant at 1 5 10 7 atm cu m mole buchner et al 2017 the dual isotope slope λ values were calculated by the york regression method ojeda et al 2019 that considers errors in both x and y axes the λn c and λh c values were determined as the slope of the fitted line where the measured δδ 13c values were plotted on the x axis and the measured δδ 15n and δδ 2h values were plotted on the y axis respectively the goodness of fit of all models was evaluated by the residual sum of squares reduced chi square and root mean square error estimation between the experimental and model data three underlying assumptions of york regression analysis i e normality homogeneity and homoscedasticity of the residuals were validated by the shapiro wilk test residual vs predicted plot and normal probability plot of the residuals respectively only the assumption of homoscedasticity was relevant for non linear fitting of the kinetics and rayleigh models all data fitting and statistical analyses were performed using originpro 2020 and the results are shown in si table s3 3 results 3 1 dark experiments and controls no significant changes in concentration and stable isotope compositions were noticed in the dark controls for the direct and indirect phototransformation experiments si table s4 this confirms that the changes in concentration and stable isotope values observed in the direct and indirect phototransformation experiments were due to phototransformation processes 3 2 direct photolysis in the direct photolysis experiments 1h benzotriazole concentrations decreased faster at lower ph values reaching less than 10 of the initial concentration in 70 166 and 324 h at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively figure 1 fig 1 the first order transformation model fit the data well si table s3 with k values at 0 0347 0 0003 ph 5 0 0148 0 0007 ph 7 and 0 0072 0 0007 h 1 ph 9 table 1 these results are consistent with previous ones reporting that the neutral 1h benzotriazole at ph values lower than its pka value at 8 2 8 6 is more reactive with light than its non ionic form at ph values greater than its pka value andreozzi et al 1998 hem et al 2003 these rate constant results are also consistent with the quantum yield of 1h benzotriazole which decreases from 5 4 10 2 mol e 1 at ph 3 and 5 to 2 9 10 2 mol e 1 at ph 7 and 9 4 10 3 mol e 1 at ph 9 benitez et al 2013 the direct photolysis experiments induced significant c and n isotope fractionation but negligible h isotope fractionation fig 1 the rayleigh model showed excellent fit to the c and n isotope data table s3 the h isotope results were variable for the ph 7 and 9 experiments indicating that care must be taken while interpreting these h isotope data fig 1 the c isotope enrichment factors ε c increased in magnitude with increasing ph from 1 64 0 04 at ph 5 to 4 3 0 2 at ph 9 table 1 the largest h isotope enrichment factor ε h was measured at ph 5 at 13 2 1 6 while the largest εn value was observed at ph 7 at 8 4 0 4 the 2d plots for the direct photolysis experiments revealed λn c values of 2 3 0 6 at ph 5 3 4 0 4 at ph 7 and 1 2 0 1 at ph 9 fig 2d the λh c values were not calculated for direct photolysis at ph 7 and 9 due to negligible h isotope fractionation whereas a λh c value of 6 0 2 9 was found at ph 5 fig 2e among the transformation products that were searched for hydroxybenzotriazole only at ph 5 3 aminophenol at ph 5 and 7 phenazine and 1 6 phenazinediol were detected and quantified fig 1 table s5 dihydroxybenzotriazole was putatively identified at ph 5 however it was not quantified due to the lack of an analytical standard the abundances of 3 aminophenol phenazine and 1 6 phenazinediol were larger in the direct than indirect photolysis experiments especially at ph 5 and 7 that of hydroxybenzotriazole in the ph 5 direct photolysis experiment were much lower between lod and loq levels than for the indirect phototransformation experiments ranging from 0 38 to 1 83 µmol l the data suggest that several of the transformation products e g 3 aminophenol at ph 5 and phenazine and 1 6 phenazinediol at ph 7 started to further transform during the course of the experiment 3 3 indirect photolysis with oh radicals under uv h2o2 in the uv h2o2 experiments done at ph 7 i e reaction with oh radicals 1h benzotriazole transformed 25 times faster than during direct photolysis at ph 7 reaching less than 10 of the initial concentration in 8 h fig 1 the reaction with oh radicals was associated with isotope fractionation that was negligible for n small for c ε c 0 65 0 03 and large for h ε h 21 6 0 8 figs 1 a c leading to a λh c value of 30 0 18 3 fig 2e hydroxybenzotriazole and putatively identified dihydroxybenzotriazole were the major transformation products in the uv h2o2 experiment and were found in significantly larger abundances than in the three direct photolysis experiments fig 1 and table s5 aniline was detected once at 2 5 h when 43 of the initial 1h benzotriazole was left the temporal trends indicate that the products formed were further transformed 4 discussion the kinetics transformation products and isotope results altogether revealed that 1h benzotriazole direct photolysis and reaction with oh radicals involve two alternative pathways the relative contribution of each pathway depends on 1h benzotriazole s dissociation state i e the solution ph and the abundance of oh radicals 4 1 oh radical induced hydroxylation dominated in indirect photolysis the results of the uv h2o2 experiment with hydroxybenzotriazole as the dominant transformation product fig 1 along with negligible n small c and moderate h isotope fractionation fig 2a c suggest an oxidative attack by oh radicals on the benzene ring fig 3a rate constants of oh radical reaction with benzene and its derivatives are in the order of 5 69 47 2 10 12 cm3 molecule 1 s 1 hansen et al 1975 indicating that oh radical addition to an aromatic ring is a kinetically favored reaction aromatic hydroxylation is known to be triggered by a slow c o bond formation in the rate determining step followed by a quick c h bond cleavage which typically results in similarly low to moderate ε c and somewhat moderate ε h values zhang et al 2015 passeport et al 2018 given that n is not involved in the aromatic hydroxylation reaction and that n atoms are a few positions away from the reaction center εn was expected to be negligible for 1h benzotriazole aromatic hydroxylation the uv h2o2 experiments were conducted with a full spectrum light from 185 to 2000 nm because 1h benzotriazole absorbs light below 300 nm fig s1 an alternative pathway via nitrogen ring opening likely occurred fig 3 path b however the negligible n isotope effect and minor detection of aniline confirmed that oh radical induced hydroxylation dominated in indirect photolysis a separate control experiment of uv h2o2 with a 280 nm longpass filter was conducted to prevent direct photolysis the results confirmed that small c isotope fractionation occurred si table s4 4 2 nitrogen ring opening dominated in direct photolysis in the direct photolysis experiments the variable kinetics at different ph values revealed differences in reactivity which increased with decreasing ph table 1 along with different isotope fractionation patterns the data suggest the contribution of different reaction pathways direct photolysis was triggered by an initial n n bond cleavage followed by nitrogen elimination with a c n bond cleavage fig 3 paths b ph 5 7 and 9 and d ph 9 this resulted in primary c and n isotope fractionation consistent with the ε c and ε n values calculated for the direct photolysis experiments fig 2a b one study on the ring opening chemistry of benzotriazoles proposed that the cleavage of the n n bond leads to two intermediate species an α imine diazo and an ortho amino arenediazonium species before the rapid elimination of n wang et al 2020 subsequent transformation then proceeded through different intermediates including diradical monoradical radical anion carbon anion zwitterion and metal associated zwitterion species wang et al 2020 substantial polarization as with zwitterions diradicals and radical ions is usually associated with larger kinetic isotope effects than with monoradical and single ion species kwan et al 2017 the ε c 4 3 to 1 64 and ε n 8 4 to 4 2 values obtained in the present study were of moderate amplitude i e one order of magnitude larger than typical total error at 0 5 for both c and n such amplitudes may suggest that direct photolysis proceeded primarily through either monoradical or carbon anion as intermediates in the direct photolysis of 1h benzotriazole nitrogen ring cleavage and nitrogen elimination took place concurrently the slight energy variations of the transition states of the concerted processes were likely the cause of variations of primary c and n isotope fractionation the presence of 3 aminophenol phenazine and 1 6 phenazinediol suggest that the reactive intermediates were stabilized via two parallel routes nitrogen elimination forming aniline and its further hydroxylation to 3 aminophenol and a dimerization process leading to phenazine that was then hydroxylated to 1 6 phenazinediol the above proposed reaction pathways agree with previous studies and the transformation products were shown to be less toxic than 1h benzotriazole based on a bioluminescence inhibition test on bacterium vibrio fischeri benitez et al 2013 in addition to the predominant nitrogen ring opening pathway fig 3 paths b and d hydroxylation by oh radicals fig 3 path a as described above for the uv h2o2 experiments might have taken place as well oh radicals can be formed by dissociative recombination of h3o under acidic conditions h2o h h3o h3o e oh h2 therefore the contribution of ring hydroxylation by oh radicals increased with decreasing ph as shown with hydroxybenzotriazole being detected at ph 5 between lod and loq levels but not at ph 7 and 9 all lod assuming that only paths a and b contributed to the observed isotope fractionation in the ph 5 direct photolysis experiment their relative contributions were estimated si section s8 using stable c isotope data as an example the isotope enrichment factor of path a can be represented by that of the uv h2o2 experiment with the 280 nm longpass filter ε c 0 6 si fig s3 and that of path b by the ε c value of the ph 7 direct photolysis experiment ε c 2 4 we thus estimated that path a contributed 42 14 and path b58 14 to 1h benzotriazole aqueous phototransformation at ph 5 since the contribution of hydroxylation increased with decreasing ph and that this path is usually accompanied with rather small ε c value zhang et al 2015 the ε c values decreased from 4 3 0 2 at ph 9 to 2 4 0 1 at ph 7 and 1 64 0 04 at ph 5 the observed small ε h value of 13 2 1 6 at ph 5 is in line with the low yield of hydroxybenzotriazole this is because aromatic hydroxylation is associated with moderate ε h values from c h bond cleavage as shown in the uv h2o2 experiment 21 6 0 8 because benzotriazole hydroxylation by oh radicals does not involve n atoms its contribution at ph 5 is expected to reduce the bulk ε n values of the direct photolysis experiment as shown with a lower ε n value at ph 5 at 4 2 0 3 than at ph 7 at 8 4 0 4 the ph 9 ε n value was lower than that at ph 7 table 1 we hypothesize that this can be explained by the acid properties of 1h benzotriazole indeed 1h benzotriazole dissociates to an anionic form at ph greater than its pka at 8 2 8 6 fig 3 path c at ph 5 and 7 more than 94 of 1h benzotriazole is in its neutral form fig s4 and the ph values remained stable during the reaction table s4 therefore n isotope fractionation for the direct photolysis contribution should be similar at both ph values the observed differences being due to the contribution of hydroxylation at ph 5 as discussed above at ph 9 72 to 86 of 1h benzotriazole is dissociated to its anionic form fig s4 which is less reactive with light than its non ionic form benitez et al 2013 hem et al 2003 the protonation deprotonation equilibrium might have perturbed the electronic structure of the triazole ring possibly influencing the isotope composition of the n atom to which the hydrogen is attached resulting in a lower ε n value at ph 9 than at ph 7 as for the effects of protonation deprotonation on the hydrogen atom of the nh group the labile h atoms exchange rapidly with the protons in the aqueous buffer solution where they are in large excess therefore the effects on the h isotope composition of 1h benzotriazole was undetectable which is reflected by the negligible ε h values during direct photolysis at ph 9 4 3 csia to aid in 1h benzotriazole fate assessment in the field in surface water environments direct and indirect phototransformation can occur concurrently with microbial transformation abiotic reactions and transfer processes such as adsorption and diffusion transfer processes are typically not associated with significant isotope fractionation harrington et al 1999 passeport et al 2014 assuming that both microbial transformation and phototransformation occur together e g in rivers or the upper zones of lakes and wetlands the isotope enrichment factors available to date from this study and huntscha et al 2014 suggest that multi element csia can help decipher these processes for example at ph 7 the small ε c values for biotransformation and direct and indirect phototransformation are similar indicating that c isotope signatures alone cannot identify which reaction mechanism dominates conversely n isotope data showed that fractionation was significant for direct photolysis small for microbial transformation and negligible for reaction with oh radicals suggesting that n csia can be used to tease apart these three processes while no ε h values exist for 1h benzotriazole biotransformation the dominance of hydroxylated forms of 1h benzotriazole in huntscha et al 2014 indicates that significant h isotope fractionation might be involved if this is confirmed distinction between microbial transformation and reaction with hydroxyl radicals would be difficult even though biodegradation half lives are orders of magnitude larger 1 114 days for aerobic conditions than phototransformation ones 2 d table 1 see shi et al 2019 and references therein however h csia can be used to confirm or rule out direct photolysis given the low concentrations of 1h benzotriazole in surface water adapted sampling and sample preparation methods will be needed e g extracting large volumes of water prior to csia schreglmann et al 2013 torrentó et al 2019 as with any contaminated site the use of multiple lines of evidence to assess contaminant fate is recommended for 1h benzotriazole as well i e combining concentration and mass decreases over time or distance identifying transformation products verifying that the geochemical and hydrogeological conditions are consistent with the proposed attenuation pathway and or applying lab bench studies and advanced tools such as multi element csia hunkeler et al 2009 5 conclusion the stable isotope fractionation and transformation product data showed a ph dependency of 1h benzotriazole direct photolysis with n ring opening as dominating at all ph values and oh radical addition to the benzene ring contributing more under acidic conditions this research established isotope enrichment factors for 1h benzotriazole direct photolysis at different ph values and its reaction with hydroxyl radicals this dataset is the first step toward the application of multi element csia to identify and quantify 1h benzotriazole phototransformation in surface water environments further research should be conducted to investigate the potential variations in isotope enrichment factors in more complex water matrices and verify the trend observed in this study that 1h benzotriazole phototransformation products did not seem to accumulate supplementary information figs s1 s5 tables s1 s6 declaration of competing interest there

16710,1h benzotriazole is part of a larger family of benzotriazoles which are widely used as lubricants polymer stabilizers corrosion inhibitors and anti icing fluid components it is frequently detected in urban runoff wastewater and receiving aquatic environments 1h benzotriazole is typically resistant to biodegradation and hydrolysis but can be transformed via direct photolysis and photoinduced mechanisms in this study the phototransformation mechanisms of 1h benzotriazole were characterized using multi element compound specific isotope analysis csia the kinetics transformation products and isotope fractionation results altogether revealed that 1h benzotriazole direct photolysis and indirect photolysis induced by oh radicals involved two alternative pathways in indirect photolysis aromatic hydroxylation dominated and was associated with small carbon εc 0 65 0 03 moderate hydrogen εh 21 6 and negligible nitrogen isotope enrichment factors and led to hydroxylated forms of benzotriazole in direct photolysis of 1h benzotriazole significant nitrogen εn 8 4 0 4 to 4 2 0 3 and carbon εc 4 3 0 2 to 1 64 0 04 isotope enrichment factors indicated an initial n n bond cleavage followed by nitrogen elimination with a c n bond cleavage the results of this study highlight the potential for multi element csia application to track 1h benzotriazole degradation in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords photodegradation water quality stable isotopes oh radicals benzotriazole 1 introduction 1h benzotriazole c6h5n3 is widely used as corrosion inhibitor photographic restrainer and chemical intermediate for producing various chemicals its antifreeze and anticorrosion properties make it a common component of vehicle fluids 1h benzotriazole is therefore frequently detected in aquatic environments wastewater treatment plant effluents and urban stormwater runoff loos et al 2010 parajulee et al 2017 however despite its endocrine disrupting effects in fish liang et al 2014 and exposure to human baduel et al 2019 almost no countries have regulated 1h benzotriazole and its environmental fate is still poorly known 1h benzotriazole has weak adsorption properties onto soil and hardwood mulch surfaces hart et al 2004 rhodes dicker and passeport 2019 and is relatively resistant to biodegradation long half lives at 114 and 315 days under aerobic and anaerobic conditions respectively were estimated from activated sludge microcosm experiments liu et al 2011 as a consequence 1h benzotriazole is only partly removed in wastewater treatment plants voutsa et al 2006 and finds its way towards aquatic environments giger et al 2006 herrero et al 2014 lai et al 2014 hydrolysis is not expected to occur due to the lack of hydrolysable functional groups lyman et al 1990 finally 1h benzotriazole is expected to undergo photolysis in surface water environments borowska et al 2016 felis et al 2016 serdechnova et al 2014 wang et al 2000 the photolysis of organic compounds which can occur via direct and indirect processes is an important degradation pathway naturally occurring in surface waters and the atmosphere the direct photolysis rate of 1h benzotriazole is ph dependent as 1h benzotriazole dissociates to an anionic form at ph greater than its pka at 8 2 8 6 that is less reactive with light than its non ionic form andreozzi et al 1998 previous studies have shown that the transformation rate of 1h benzotriazole increases slightly in the presence of dissolved organic matter chung et al 2018 janssen et al 2015 assessing the relative contribution of the different reaction pathways is important to characterize 1h benzotriazole fate in aquatic ecosystems and predict the formation of potentially toxic transformation products however it is difficult due to the challenges associated with the identification of transformation products e g lack of standard materials and the apportionment of transformation products to different reaction pathways for instance aromatic monohydroxylation resulting in the formation of hydroxybenzotriazole has been proposed as the predominant step during both biotransformation huntscha et al 2014 and phototransformation of 1h benzotriazole in uv and uv h2o2 systems borowska et al 2016 compound specific isotope analysis csia is a promising tool to track and quantify contaminant transformation in the environment elsner and imfeld 2016 csia is mainly used to identify and quantify in situ the transformation of traditional contaminants such as hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents at groundwater contaminated sites hunkeler et al 2009 nijenhuis and richnow 2016 vogt et al 2016 it is based on the principle that molecules containing light isotopes e g 12c react faster than those with heavy isotopes e g 13c leading to kinetic isotope fractionation in bio chemical processes involving bond cleavage reactions bigeleisen and wolfsberg 1957 due to its highly reaction specific isotope fractionation patterns csia can provide direct evidence of contaminant transformation and has the potential to provide insights into transformation mechanisms without identifying transformation products hofstetter et al 2008 in addition measuring changes of isotope composition of more than one element can help identify the relative contributions of different reaction mechanisms recently csia has been proposed for characterizing the transformation processes of more emerging micropollutants such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals birkigt et al 2015 fenner et al 2013 milosevic et al 2013 wu et al 2018 and for investigating the abiotic transformation mechanisms such as hydrolysis masbou et al 2018 wu et al 2017 photolysis passeport et al 2018 ratti et al 2015 wu et al 2018 and radical oxidation liu et al 2018 willach et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 of organic compounds csia has been applied in one study so far to assess 1h benzotriazole biotransformation in activated sludge huntscha et al 2014 the authors reported small isotope enrichment factors for carbon ε c and nitrogen ε n at 1 9 0 1 and 1 1 0 2 respectively however no research has explored the kinetic isotope effects of 1h benzotriazole during phototransformation thus hindering the application of csia to identify and quantify 1h benzotriazole phototransformation mechanisms in surface water the aim of the present study was to characterize the aqueous phototransformation mechanisms of 1h benzotriazole by applying three dimensional csia and product identification the specific objectives were i to evaluate reaction kinetic rate constants for aqueous phototransformation of 1h benzotriazole as a function of ph ii to develop analytical methods of 13c 2h and 15n csia for 1h benzotriazole iii to derive reference carbon εc hydrogen εh and nitrogen εn isotope enrichment factors during aqueous phototransformation of 1h benzotriazole and iv to identify phototransformation mechanisms of 1h benzotriazole using c n and c h dual isotope plots and transformation product identification 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals 1h benzotriazole bt0 purity 98 0 used for phototransformation

benzotriazole in phosphate buffer 10 mm at ph 5 7 and 9 1h benzotriazole has a maximum light absorbance at approximately 260 nm at ph 5 and 7 and 274 nm at ph 9 in phosphate buffer supplementary information si fig s1 direct photolysis experiments were carried out in a 1 l quartz erlenmeyer flask using a 100 w oriel research xenon arc lamp model 6257 ozone free wavelength 225 800 nm newport equipped with a liquid optical filter model 6214 including a fused silica window to transmit down to 250 nm newport as the light source similar to those described elsewhere bergquist and blum 2007 ten ml of 1h benzotriazole stock solution 2000 mg l in milli q water were mixed with 990 ml of phosphate buffer 10 mm in an amber glass bottle reaching an initial concentration of 20 mg l 168 µm the solution was transferred to the quartz reactor after adjusting to the desired ph and then was continuously mixed on a magnetic stirrer at 300 rpm during the experiment and maintained at constant room temperature the xenon lamp was warmed up for 20 min before starting the photoreaction and its irradiance was measured between experiments which confirmed no significant change in light conditions among experiments at different time intervals 1 5 ml of reaction solution was taken for concentration measurement and 60 ml of reaction solution was saved for isotope composition measurement after solid phase extraction dark control experiments at different ph values were conducted in 200 ml amber glass bottle under the same condition 2 2 2 indirect phototransformation using uv h2o2 because the ph has no effect on the reaction of oh radicals with 1h benzotriazole borowska et al 2016 the indirect photolysis experiments using uv h2o2 were conducted at neutral condition due to the unavailability of the photochemical reaction setup described above a photochemical reactor system consisting of a 2 l pyrex cylindrical flask with a quartz window and a 150 w xenon lamp as the light source type l2175 wavelength 185 2000 nm hamamatsu japan were applied for the indirect photolysis experiment and its corresponding control experiments the experiments were performed under the same conditions as described above for direct photolysis except that the reaction was initiated by the addition of 30 h2o2 into the solution to reach an initial molar ratio of 1 200 for 1h benzotriazole and h2o2 control experiments were conducted with 1h benzotriazole at ph 7 with 1 uv irradiation only uv without h2o2 2 addition of h2o2 but no uv irradiation dark control and 3 uv h2o2 and a 280 nm longpass filter 2 3 sample preparation by solid phase extraction oasis hlb cartridges 6 ml cartridges 200 mg waters milford ma usa were chosen for solid phase extraction of 1h benzotriazole prior to stable isotope analysis spahr et al 2013 the oasis hlb cartridges were first conditioned with 15 ml of hexane followed by 10 ml of ethyl acetate 5 ml of methanol and 10 ml of acidified milli q water ph 2 all samples were acidified to ph 2 with 1 m hcl and then percolated through the conditioned cartridges drop by drop under vacuum subsequently the cartridges were washed with 5 ml milli q water ph 2 and dried under vacuum for 30 min the remaining 1h benzotriazole was then eluted from the cartridges with 10 ml of ethyl acetate the volume of the eluted ethyl acetate was reduced under a gentle nitrogen stream to 1 ml or to 100 μl if needed and stored at 4 c until measurement without further pre treatment before analysis the average recovery rate was 96 1 and the observed shifts in stable isotope compositions of 1h benzotriazole could be considered as negligible table s1 section s2 2 4 analytical methods 2 4 1 concentration analysis all samples were analyzed with a thermo scientific

data were collected in positive and negative ionization modes with a full scan range of mass to charge ratios m z from 80 to 1000 a resolution of 70 000 at 1 hz an automatic gain control agc target of 3 10 6 and a maximum injection time of 100 ms seven potential phototransformation products including 4 hydroxybenzotriazole 5 hydroxybenzotriazole aniline 3 aminophenol phenazine 1 6 phenazinediol 2 6 diethylaniline and seven potential biotransformation products including 1 methylbenzotriazole 4 methoxybenzotriazole 5 methoxybenzotriazole phenol dimethyl benzylamine carbazole phthalic acid were targeted in the present study as they are the most commonly found transformation products for 1h benzotriazole 4 and 5 hydroxybenzotriazole isomers could not be separated by orbitrap analysis therefore we referred to both isomers as hydroxybenzotriazole the limits of detection lod and quantification loq were determined from the linear calibration curves by running a series of concentration standards using the standard deviation of the concentration response σ and the slope s of the calibration curve using the following equations lod 3 3 σ s and loq 10 σ s the loq for the detected tps were 0 20 μmol l for hydroxybenzotriazole 0 55 μmol l for aniline 0 38 μmol l for 3 aminophenol 0 16 μmol l for phenazine 1 39 μmol l for 1 6 phenazinediol and 0 005 μmol l for phthalic acid all other details are provided in table s5 2 5 data analysis the first order kinetic constants k and the isotope enrichment factors ε were obtained from direct fitting of the first order kinetics model and the rayleigh equation eq 1 mariotti et al 1981 respectively to the data using non linear regression eq 1 h e l e t h e l e 0 f t ε where he le t and he le 0 are the stable isotope ratios of element e in 1h benzotriazole at time t and 0 respectively and f t is the fraction of remaining 1h benzotriazole at time t data points at later stages of the reaction when less than 20 of 1h benzotriazole was left were not used to fit the rayleigh model this is because the largest changes in isotope composition occur in these later stages of the reaction when the uncertainty in f is also the largest bigeleisen and allen 1951 mundle et al 2016 no correction for repetitive sampling was needed as 1h benzotriazole is poorly volatile estimated henry s law constant at 1 5 10 7 atm cu m mole buchner et al 2017 the dual isotope slope λ values were calculated by the york regression method ojeda et al 2019 that considers errors in both x and y axes the λn c and λh c values were determined as the slope of the fitted line where the measured δδ 13c values were plotted on the x axis and the measured δδ 15n and δδ 2h values were plotted on the y axis respectively the goodness of fit of all models was evaluated by the residual sum of squares reduced chi square and root mean square error estimation between the experimental and model data three underlying assumptions of york regression analysis i e normality homogeneity and homoscedasticity of the residuals were validated by the shapiro wilk test residual vs predicted plot and normal probability plot of the residuals respectively only the assumption of homoscedasticity was relevant for non linear fitting of the kinetics and rayleigh models all data fitting and statistical analyses were performed using originpro 2020 and the results are shown in si table s3 3 results 3 1 dark experiments and controls no significant changes in concentration and stable isotope compositions were noticed in the dark controls for the direct and indirect phototransformation experiments si table s4 this confirms that the changes in concentration and stable isotope values observed in the direct and indirect phototransformation experiments were due to phototransformation processes 3 2 direct photolysis in the direct photolysis experiments 1h benzotriazole concentrations decreased faster at lower ph values reaching less than 10 of the initial concentration in 70 166 and 324 h at ph 5 7 and 9 respectively figure 1 fig 1 the first order transformation model fit the data well si table s3 with k values at 0 0347 0 0003 ph 5 0 0148 0 0007 ph 7 and 0 0072 0 0007 h 1 ph 9 table 1 these results are consistent with previous ones reporting that the neutral 1h benzotriazole at ph values lower than its pka value at 8 2 8 6 is more reactive with light than its non ionic form at ph values greater than its pka value andreozzi et al 1998 hem et al 2003 these rate constant results are also consistent with the quantum yield of 1h benzotriazole which decreases from 5 4 10 2 mol e 1 at ph 3 and 5 to 2 9 10 2 mol e 1 at ph 7 and 9 4 10 3 mol e 1 at ph 9 benitez et al 2013 the direct photolysis experiments induced significant c and n isotope fractionation but negligible h isotope fractionation fig 1 the rayleigh model showed excellent fit to the c and n isotope data table s3 the h isotope results were variable for the ph 7 and 9 experiments indicating that care must be taken while interpreting these h isotope data fig 1 the c isotope enrichment factors ε c increased in magnitude with increasing ph from 1 64 0 04 at ph 5 to 4 3 0 2 at ph 9 table 1 the largest h isotope enrichment factor ε h was measured at ph 5 at 13 2 1 6 while the largest εn value was observed at ph 7 at 8 4 0 4 the 2d plots for the direct photolysis experiments revealed λn c values of 2 3 0 6 at ph 5 3 4 0 4 at ph 7 and 1 2 0 1 at ph 9 fig 2d the λh c values were not calculated for direct photolysis at ph 7 and 9 due to negligible h isotope fractionation whereas a λh c value of 6 0 2 9 was found at ph 5 fig 2e among the transformation products that were searched for hydroxybenzotriazole only at ph 5 3 aminophenol at ph 5 and 7 phenazine and 1 6 phenazinediol were detected and quantified fig 1 table s5 dihydroxybenzotriazole was putatively identified at ph 5 however it was not quantified due to the lack of an analytical standard the abundances of 3 aminophenol phenazine and 1 6 phenazinediol were larger in the direct than indirect photolysis experiments especially at ph 5 and 7 that of hydroxybenzotriazole in the ph 5 direct photolysis experiment were much lower between lod and loq levels than for the indirect phototransformation experiments ranging from 0 38 to 1 83 µmol l the data suggest that several of the transformation products e g 3 aminophenol at ph 5 and phenazine and 1 6 phenazinediol at ph 7 started to further transform during the course of the experiment 3 3 indirect photolysis with oh radicals under uv h2o2 in the uv h2o2 experiments done at ph 7 i e reaction with oh radicals 1h benzotriazole transformed 25 times faster than during direct photolysis at ph 7 reaching less than 10 of the initial concentration in 8 h fig 1 the reaction with oh radicals was associated with isotope fractionation that was negligible for n small for c ε c 0 65 0 03 and large for h ε h 21 6 0 8 figs 1 a c leading to a λh c value of 30 0 18 3 fig 2e hydroxybenzotriazole and putatively identified dihydroxybenzotriazole were the major transformation products in the uv h2o2 experiment and were found in significantly larger abundances than in the three direct photolysis experiments fig 1 and table s5 aniline was detected once at 2 5 h when 43 of the initial 1h benzotriazole was left the temporal trends indicate that the products formed were further transformed 4 discussion the kinetics transformation products and isotope results altogether revealed that 1h benzotriazole direct photolysis and reaction with oh radicals involve two alternative pathways the relative contribution of each pathway depends on 1h benzotriazole s dissociation state i e the solution ph and the abundance of oh radicals 4 1 oh radical induced hydroxylation dominated in indirect photolysis the results of the uv h2o2 experiment with hydroxybenzotriazole as the dominant transformation product fig 1 along with negligible n small c and moderate h isotope fractionation fig 2a c suggest an oxidative attack by oh radicals on the benzene ring fig 3a rate constants of oh radical reaction with benzene and its derivatives are in the order of 5 69 47 2 10 12 cm3 molecule 1 s 1 hansen et al 1975 indicating that oh radical addition to an aromatic ring is a kinetically favored reaction aromatic hydroxylation is known to be triggered by a slow c o bond formation in the rate determining step followed by a quick c h bond cleavage which typically results in similarly low to moderate ε c and somewhat moderate ε h values zhang et al 2015 passeport et al 2018 given that n is not involved in the aromatic hydroxylation reaction and that n atoms are a few positions away from the reaction center εn was expected to be negligible for 1h benzotriazole aromatic hydroxylation the uv h2o2 experiments were conducted with a full spectrum light from 185 to 2000 nm because 1h benzotriazole absorbs light below 300 nm fig s1 an alternative pathway via nitrogen ring opening likely occurred fig 3 path b however the negligible n isotope effect and minor detection of aniline confirmed that oh radical induced hydroxylation dominated in indirect photolysis a separate control experiment of uv h2o2 with a 280 nm longpass filter was conducted to prevent direct photolysis the results confirmed that small c isotope fractionation occurred si table s4 4 2 nitrogen ring opening dominated in direct photolysis in the direct photolysis experiments the variable kinetics at different ph values revealed differences in reactivity which increased with decreasing ph table 1 along with different isotope fractionation patterns the data suggest the contribution of different reaction pathways direct photolysis was triggered by an initial n n bond cleavage followed by nitrogen elimination with a c n bond cleavage fig 3 paths b ph 5 7 and 9 and d ph 9 this resulted in primary c and n isotope fractionation consistent with the ε c and ε n values calculated for the direct photolysis experiments fig 2a b one study on the ring opening chemistry of benzotriazoles proposed that the cleavage of the n n bond leads to two intermediate species an α imine diazo and an ortho amino arenediazonium species before the rapid elimination of n wang et al 2020 subsequent transformation then proceeded through different intermediates including diradical monoradical radical anion carbon anion zwitterion and metal associated zwitterion species wang et al 2020 substantial polarization as with zwitterions diradicals and radical ions is usually associated with larger kinetic isotope effects than with monoradical and single ion species kwan et al 2017 the ε c 4 3 to 1 64 and ε n 8 4 to 4 2 values obtained in the present study were of moderate amplitude i e one order of magnitude larger than typical total error at 0 5 for both c and n such amplitudes may suggest that direct photolysis proceeded primarily through either monoradical or carbon anion as intermediates in the direct photolysis of 1h benzotriazole nitrogen ring cleavage and nitrogen elimination took place concurrently the slight energy variations of the transition states of the concerted processes were likely the cause of variations of primary c and n isotope fractionation the presence of 3 aminophenol phenazine and 1 6 phenazinediol suggest that the reactive intermediates were stabilized via two parallel routes nitrogen elimination forming aniline and its further hydroxylation to 3 aminophenol and a dimerization process leading to phenazine that was then hydroxylated to 1 6 phenazinediol the above proposed reaction pathways agree with previous studies and the transformation products were shown to be less toxic than 1h benzotriazole based on a bioluminescence inhibition test on bacterium vibrio fischeri benitez et al 2013 in addition to the predominant nitrogen ring opening pathway fig 3 paths b and d hydroxylation by oh radicals fig 3 path a as described above for the uv h2o2 experiments might have taken place as well oh radicals can be formed by dissociative recombination of h3o under acidic conditions h2o h h3o h3o e oh h2 therefore the contribution of ring hydroxylation by oh radicals increased with decreasing ph as shown with hydroxybenzotriazole being detected at ph 5 between lod and loq levels but not at ph 7 and 9 all lod assuming that only paths a and b contributed to the observed isotope fractionation in the ph 5 direct photolysis experiment their relative contributions were estimated si section s8 using stable c isotope data as an example the isotope enrichment factor of path a can be represented by that of the uv h2o2 experiment with the 280 nm longpass filter ε c 0 6 si fig s3 and that of path b by the ε c value of the ph 7 direct photolysis experiment ε c 2 4 we thus estimated that path a contributed 42 14 and path b58 14 to 1h benzotriazole aqueous phototransformation at ph 5 since the contribution of hydroxylation increased with decreasing ph and that this path is usually accompanied with rather small ε c value zhang et al 2015 the ε c values decreased from 4 3 0 2 at ph 9 to 2 4 0 1 at ph 7 and 1 64 0 04 at ph 5 the observed small ε h value of 13 2 1 6 at ph 5 is in line with the low yield of hydroxybenzotriazole this is because aromatic hydroxylation is associated with moderate ε h values from c h bond cleavage as shown in the uv h2o2 experiment 21 6 0 8 because benzotriazole hydroxylation by oh radicals does not involve n atoms its contribution at ph 5 is expected to reduce the bulk ε n values of the direct photolysis experiment as shown with a lower ε n value at ph 5 at 4 2 0 3 than at ph 7 at 8 4 0 4 the ph 9 ε n value was lower than that at ph 7 table 1 we hypothesize that this can be explained by the acid properties of 1h benzotriazole indeed 1h benzotriazole dissociates to an anionic form at ph greater than its pka at 8 2 8 6 fig 3 path c at ph 5 and 7 more than 94 of 1h benzotriazole is in its neutral form fig s4 and the ph values remained stable during the reaction table s4 therefore n isotope fractionation for the direct photolysis contribution should be similar at both ph values the observed differences being due to the contribution of hydroxylation at ph 5 as discussed above at ph 9 72 to 86 of 1h benzotriazole is dissociated to its anionic form fig s4 which is less reactive with light than its non ionic form benitez et al 2013 hem et al 2003 the protonation deprotonation equilibrium might have perturbed the electronic structure of the triazole ring possibly influencing the isotope composition of the n atom to which the hydrogen is attached resulting in a lower ε n value at ph 9 than at ph 7 as for the effects of protonation deprotonation on the hydrogen atom of the nh group the labile h atoms exchange rapidly with the protons in the aqueous buffer solution where they are in large excess therefore the effects on the h isotope composition of 1h benzotriazole was undetectable which is reflected by the negligible ε h values during direct photolysis at ph 9 4 3 csia to aid in 1h benzotriazole fate assessment in the field in surface water environments direct and indirect phototransformation can occur concurrently with microbial transformation abiotic reactions and transfer processes such as adsorption and diffusion transfer processes are typically not associated with significant isotope fractionation harrington et al 1999 passeport et al 2014 assuming that both microbial transformation and phototransformation occur together e g in rivers or the upper zones of lakes and wetlands the isotope enrichment factors available to date from this study and huntscha et al 2014 suggest that multi element csia can help decipher these processes for example at ph 7 the small ε c values for biotransformation and direct and indirect phototransformation are similar indicating that c isotope signatures alone cannot identify which reaction mechanism dominates conversely n isotope data showed that fractionation was significant for direct photolysis small for microbial transformation and negligible for reaction with oh radicals suggesting that n csia can be used to tease apart these three processes while no ε h values exist for 1h benzotriazole biotransformation the dominance of hydroxylated forms of 1h benzotriazole in huntscha et al 2014 indicates that significant h isotope fractionation might be involved if this is confirmed distinction between microbial transformation and reaction with hydroxyl radicals would be difficult even though biodegradation half lives are orders of magnitude larger 1 114 days for aerobic conditions than phototransformation ones 2 d table 1 see shi et al 2019 and references therein however h csia can be used to confirm or rule out direct photolysis given the low concentrations of 1h benzotriazole in surface water adapted sampling and sample preparation methods will be needed e g extracting large volumes of water prior to csia schreglmann et al 2013 torrentó et al 2019 as with any contaminated site the use of multiple lines of evidence to assess contaminant fate is recommended for 1h benzotriazole as well i e combining concentration and mass decreases over time or distance identifying transformation products verifying that the geochemical and hydrogeological conditions are consistent with the proposed attenuation pathway and or applying lab bench studies and advanced tools such as multi element csia hunkeler et al 2009 5 conclusion the stable isotope fractionation and transformation product data showed a ph dependency of 1h benzotriazole direct photolysis with n ring opening as dominating at all ph values and oh radical addition to the benzene ring contributing more under acidic conditions this research established isotope enrichment factors for 1h benzotriazole direct

polydopamine pda as a model coating to comprehensively link the changes in membrane properties with the changes in transmission of 34 oms the membrane characterization demonstrated that a thicker denser and more hydrophilic pda coating can be achieved by increasing the pda deposition time from 0 5 to 4 hours overall the transmissions of target oms were reduced by pda coated nf membranes compared to unmodified nf membranes the neutral hydrophobic compounds showed lower transmissions for longer pda coating pda4 while the neutral hydrophilic compounds tended to show lower transmissions for shorter pda coating pda0 5 to explain this competing effects provided by the pda coatings are proposed including sealing defects inducing cake enhanced concentration polarization in the coating layer for neutral hydrophilic compounds and weakened hydrophobic adsorption for neutral hydrophobic compounds for charged compounds pda4 with the greatest negative charge among the pda coated membranes showed the lowest transmission depending on the molecular size and hydrophilicity of the compounds the transmission of oms by the pda4 coating could be reduced by 70 with only a 26 4 decline in water permeance the correlations and mechanistic insights provided by this work are highly useful for designing membranes with specific surface properties via surface modification to improve the removal of oms without compromising water production graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanofiltration membrane surface modification organic micropollutants solute transport 1 introduction the nanofiltration nf membrane process has been widely used in drinking water production wastewater tertiary treatment and wastewater reuse however its inadequate removal of organic micropollutants oms especially some neutrally charged small organic compounds has hindered its applications bellona et al 2012 van der bruggen et al 2008 oms also interchangeably referred to as trace organics or contaminants of emerging concern cover a wide range of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides household products and industrial chemicals that have been ubiquitously detected in the aquatic environment at trace levels ng l to a few μg l ebele et al 2017 luo et al 2014 depending on the concentration and frequency exposure to these chemicals can result in adverse effects such as disrupting endocrine systems and inducing cancers and lethal effects on aquatic organisms and or human consumers bolong et al 2009 shao et al 2019 one of the main sources of oms entering the aquatic environment is via wastewater effluent discharge since the current wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed to efficiently remove oms khanzada et al 2020 luo et al 2014 accordingly some wwtps employ nf units as tertiary treatment to further remove oms garcia ivars et al 2017 in another scenario the current indirect potable reuse scheme uses reverse osmosis ro as an absolute barrier and expects to fully remove all contaminants from wastewater drewes et al 2005 some studies have proposed the use of nf in this role in lieu of ro due to its higher water permeability which would lead to lower energy consumption bellona et al 2012 mohammad et al 2015 yangali quintanilla et al 2010 although tight nf membranes have shown only a slightly lower rejection of oms than ro membranes neither of them can fully remove all oms yangali quintanilla et al 2010 thus for both scenarios improving the rejection of oms by nf while keeping the high water permeability is of great interest surface modification has been reported as a promising method to improve the rejection of oms by membranes khanzada et al 2020 kim et al 2018 kim et al 2008 reported the use of graft polymerization on nf membranes to improve the rejection of bisphenol a ibuprofen and salicylic acid similarly two other reagents for surface grafting were applied in another study and the rejections of bisphenol a and metolachlor by modified nf270 membranes were improved ben david et al 2010 another group attempted to modify a commercial low pressure ro lpro membrane using a grafting method baransi karkaby et al 2019 however due to the existing high rejection of the three contaminants carbamazepine bisphenol a and acetaminophen by the pristine lpro membrane the improvement was marginal guo et al applied hydrophilic polydopamine pda coating and pda agnps coating on nf membranes to improve the rejection of four hydrophobic endocrine disrupting compounds edcs guo et al 2016 guo et al 2017 liu et al 2019 grafted hydrophilic diethanolamine and monoethanolamine on in house nf membranes which resulted in increased water permeability reduced nacl rejection and negligible change in rejection of eight oms although these prior studies showed incremental improvements in separation and in some cases increased rejection of oms they were limited in scope the motivation for this study is that oms consist of a broad class of chemicals with varying molecular size hydrophilicity pka toxicity and upstream removal efficiency by current in house treatments improving the rejection of one category of oms by changing membrane surface properties may result in detrimental changes for other categories importantly a clear correlation between membrane properties and the physiochemical properties of a wide range of oms that are present in the environment is needed the principle of surface modification to improve the rejection of oms by nf ro membranes relies on tailoring the removal mechanisms of organic solutes by membranes including by size exclusion electrostatic repulsion donnan exclusion effect and hydrophobic interaction bellona et al 2004 khanzada et al 2020 kim et al 2018 for instance bellona et al 2004 proposed a rejection diagram to predict the rejection efficiency of oms depending on the oms and membrane properties from the perspective of membrane properties the diagram demonstrated how the membrane pore size and the surface charge can affect the rejection of organic solutes increasing the surface charge would increase the rejection of charged compounds by enhancing electrostatic repulsion kim et al 2008 yang et al 2017 smaller membrane pore size would increase the rejection of all compounds by enhancing size exclusion but would also result in a decline of water permeability liu et al 2019 in terms of surface interactions most of the current nf ro membranes have a hydrophobic polyamide separation layer that can induce adsorption of hydrophobic oms and result in lower rejection kimura et al 2003 nghiem et al 2004 thus membrane hydrophilicity has become an important property of membranes for modification for example guo et al 2016 demonstrated that a hydrophilic coating could weaken the hydrophobic adsorption of neutral hydrophobic oms which contributed to higher rejection rates of four hydrophobic compounds however the effect of a hydrophilic coating on the transport of hydrophilic oms remains unknown in this work we have used hydrophilic pda as a model coating to comprehensively correlate the modified membrane properties to the changes in transmission of 34 oms in previous works pda coating has shown good hydrophilic properties lee et al 2007 adhesive ability lee et al 2007 li et al 2009 and antifouling properties karkhanechi et al 2014 mccloskey et al 2012 which makes it a promising polymer for membrane surface modification liu et al 2014 nf90 was selected as the target membrane for modification due to its potential to replace ro membranes in indirect potable reuse yangali quintanilla et al 2010 in addition the separation layer of nf90 is made by interfacial polymerization of trimesoyl chloride and m phenylenediamine which is also the benchmark chemistry for most ro membranes this might expand the implications of this work to broader applications membrane properties including membrane morphology surface roughness membrane chemistry surface hydrophilicity surface charge water permeability and salt rejection were systematically characterised the filtration experiments used a mixture of 34 oms which have been frequently detected in wastewater effluents luo et al 2014 and vary in molecular size hydrophilicity and charge tests were conducted at environmentally relevant feed concentrations and typical filtration conditions in general the removal of the 34 oms was improved by applying pda coatings for different coating durations and an optimal coating time is identified a comprehensive discussion relating the improvements in the removal of oms to the change of membrane properties is provided in this paper 2 materials and methods 2 1

filtration protocol a bench scale filtration system made of stainless steel was constructed to conduct the filtration experiments of oms fig 1 the system allowed the permeate to be circulated back to

biosystems foster city ca usa the detailed lc ms ms methods and the limits of reporting lor that were determined experimentally are provided in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 membrane morphology the morphology of pristine nf90 observed by both sem and tem micrographs fig 2 is consistent with previous studies song et al 2020 yan et al 2019 the polyamide rejection layer consists of an interior section of typical nodular protuberances containing nanovoids and an interconnected and relatively flat exterior layer the exterior layer has some crater like regions due to the incomplete coverage the intrinsic thickness of these polyamide films i e the true film thickness excluding voids is 10 to 20 nm which is much thinner compared to the height of the nodular layer the apparent thickness of 150 to 200 nm fig 2b nf90 for pda coated membranes the tem micrographs show that the rejection layers tend to have a greater apparent thickness 300 to 400 nm compared to the pristine nf90 membrane which is very likely due to the deposition of pda fig 2 in addition some of the voids appear to be partially filled particularly at longer coating durations e g 2 and 4 h resulting in a denser appearance for pda2 and pda4 the sem micrographs show a progressive enrichment of pda nanoparticles on the polyamide surface from pda0 5 to pda4 but in general the membranes retain many of their original features e g nodules and crater like regions although the exact formation mechanism of pda is still an ongoing debate it is generally believed that dopamine is oxidized into different building blocks such as catechol amine quinone and indole and then forms aggregates oligomers depending on the proposed mechanisms in the bulk solution over time liu et al 2014 ryu et al 2018 the aggregates oligomers and single building blocks then adhere to the substrate by hydrogen bonding π stacking charge transfer etc the increasing appearance of pda nanoparticles on the nf90 surface with a longer coating time may indicate that more functional groups from pda were deposited onto the membrane surface the pda coatings had only a modest effect 20 on the surface roughness fig 2c and table s2 probably due to the rough nature of the underlying polyamide film 3 1 2 membrane chemistry to further confirm the deposition of pda layers the chemistry of the membranes was analysed by xps and atr ftir the atr ftir results fig s2 confirm the chemistry of nf90 all the peaks match a typical fully aromatic polyamide membrane reported previously tang et al 2009 no distinguishable ftir peaks for the pda coating are observed due to the relatively deep penetration depth 200 nm and the chemical similarity of pda to the membrane matrix however the xps scans a sample within less than 10 nm penetration depth which means that the xps results fig 3 are more surface sensitive for the detection of pda coating as shown in fig 3 f the oxygen content increases from 14 6 to 21 3 by increasing coating time from 0 to 4 hours while the nitrogen content decreases from 13 5 to 8 5 the o n ratio increases from 1 09 to 2 52 and the n c ratio decreases from 0 19 to 0 12 the high resolution scans of oxygen spectra fig 3 a b c d e show an increase of the o c functional group from 24 2 to 55 5 the nitrogen spectra fig s5 also show an increasing peak of the n r functional group with coating time these results confirm that pda was successfully coated on the membrane interestingly the o n ratio of pda4 exceeds 2 which is often considered as the theoretical o n ratio of pda coating liebscher et al 2013 wang et al 2019 many other studies have also observed the o n ratio of pda can exceed 2 karkhanechi et al 2014 patel et al 2018 wang et al 2016 this may be explained by the formation of carboxyl groups in the pda structure della vecchia et al 2013 or the covalent incorporation of the tris molecule containing three hydroxyl functional groups into the pda matrix fig s6 and patel et al 2018 more information can be obtained from the xps results when compared with the reported xps results of pure pda samples rella et al 2018 investigated the pda structure using the same coating method but on gold sheets and glass slides in their study pda coating time was from 1 to 5 hours and they found 1 the o c of oxygen content increased from 2 09 to 49 34 2 the o c decreased from 97 91 to 50 6 and 3 the n c ratio increased from 0 092 to 0 101 in comparison only pda2 and pda4 in our work show an o c percentage that is within the o c range from their results and only pda4 shows an n c ratio that is close to their 0 101 at 5 hour coating this means that the xps scans of pda2 and pda4 are more likely to characterise the dominant pda layer while scans of pda0 5 and pda1 are likely to characterise the combined presence of the pda and polyamide thus it is reasonable to conclude that a thicker xps penetration depth and fully covered pda layer was developed in pda2 and pda4 comparatively pda0 5 and pda1 had a relatively thin pda layers or incomplete coverage of pda on the membrane due to the rough surface of nf90 3 1 3 membrane hydrophilicity and surface charge the membrane hydrophilicity was characterised by wca table 2 which steadily decreased from 68 4 to 47 3 by increasing pda coating time this is in good agreement with both sem and tem observations and xps characterization as discussed above the increase of hydrophilicity could be attributed to the increased deposition of hydrophilic moieties from pda especially the hydroxyl functional groups e g increasing oxygen content and increasing percentage of o c from xps results lee et al 2007 liu et al 2014 zeta potentials of different membranes are presented in table 2 and fig s8 all samples show a positive charge at low ph and a negative charge at high ph fig s8 since both polyamide and pda have amine groups and hydroxyl carboxyl groups fig s6 the pristine nf90 consistently shows a greater negative charge than the pda coated membranes at ph around 7 this could be due to the coverage of the carboxyl groups in the polyamide matrix by pda with hydroxyl groups the carboxyl group on an aromatic ring has a pka in water lower than 4 jover et al 2008 whereas the hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring has a pka in the water around 10 gross and seybold 2001 thus at ph around 7 the pristine nf90 with more carboxyl groups exposed at the surface would be more likely to have deprotonated moieties providing a more net negative charge at ph higher than 10 the pda coated membranes show similar or slightly more negative values than nf90 fig s8 which supports this explanation because each pda monomer could have two deprotonated hydroxyl groups fig s6 among pda coated membranes pda2 and pda4 have greater negative charges compared to pda0 5 and pda1 at ph 7 table 2 the greater negative charge may be due to the possible formation of carboxyl groups during the longer time oxidation of pda as mentioned in section 3 1 2 della vecchia et al 2013 3 2 removal of neutral compounds 3 2 1 removal of neutral compounds by nf90 according to the solution diffusion theory solute transport through a membrane is governed by both the solubility of the compound in the membrane material and its diffusion inside the membranes obviously the solubility sorption by the membrane depends on solute membrane interactions including size exclusion hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic repulsion at the same time the solute diffusion inside of the membrane is also affected by these interactions for example one would expect slower solute diffusion under stronger size exclusion effect i e for smaller membrane pore size or larger solute size the main removal mechanisms of nf ro membranes against neutral oms are size exclusion and hydrophilic hydrophobic interactions bellona et al 2004 khanzada et al 2020 kim et al 2018 thus it is imperative to understand the role played by the two mechanisms in removing oms with varying physiochemical properties on the base pristine nf90 membrane fig 4 presents the transmission of neutral compounds by nf90 correlated to mw and molecular dimensions the neutral oms are classified into three categories hydrophilic compounds logd 2 moderately hydrophobic compounds 2 logd 3 and hydrophobic compounds logd 3 as shown in fig 4 a and b the hydrophilic compounds exhibit clear trends the transmissions decrease with increase in molecular weight mw and van der waals vdw radius this agrees with previous studies which proposed that the main removal mechanism of neutral hydrophilic compounds is by size exclusion albergamo et al 2019 fujioka et al 2014 in contrast the transmissions of moderately hydrophobic and hydrophobic compounds tend to show higher transmissions compared to their hydrophilic counterparts of similar mw or vdw high transmissions of diuron linuron triclosan and triclocarban have also been observed in other studies fujioka et al 2014 fujioka et al 2015 nghiem and coleman 2008 the higher transmissions could be attributed to the hydrophobic adsorption of these compounds onto the relatively hydrophobic polyamide membrane followed by diffusion and or convection kim et al 2007 kimura et al 2003 nghiem and coleman 2008 nghiem et al 2004 given that many studies have suggested that the use of vdw radius or stokes radius to correlate solute transmission may be inaccurate due to the assumption of spherical shape alturki et al 2010 bellona et al 2004 fujioka et al 2014 yang et al 2017 we also present the correlation of transmission with minimum and maximum projection radius fig 4c and d it has been suggested in many studies that minimum projection area is a better correlator to the rejection of organic compound fujioka et al 2018 shin et al 2022 the maximum projection radius shows poor correlation with the transmission of all neutral compounds conversely three moderately hydrophobic compounds propylparaben diuron and linuron show a better transmission trend when the transmissions are arranged by the minimum projection radius nevertheless the minimum projection radius is not a universal correlator as paracetamol and phenylphenol dramatically deviate from the trend in fig 4c although they fit well with the vdw radius trends fig 4b moreover propylparaben and diuron have very similar minimum projection radius but propylparaben has a much higher transmission thus in addition to hydrophobic adsorption the relatively higher transmission of moderately hydrophobic compounds particularly diuron and linuron may be also partially due to their elongated ellipsoid or cuboid shapes and orientation during transport for hydrophobic compounds neither of the minimum or maximum projection radius shows a preferable trend two hydrophobic compounds triclosan and triclocarban consistently show higher transmissions than other compounds with similar mw or size triclosan and triclocarban have the two highest logd values among all the neutral compounds and could have a greater extent of adsorption and partitioning through the membrane this supports the view that hydrophobic interaction may play a dominant role in the transmission of hydrophobic compounds 3 2 2 the effect of pda coating on the removal of neutral compounds for all neutral compounds the pda coated membranes show reduced transmission compared to nf90 except the transmissions of benzotriazole and 5 methylbenzotriazole by pda1 fig 5 the transmission reduction by pda coated membranes appears to be more obvious for hydrophobic compounds fig 5c and the transmissions of hydrophobic compounds rank in the order nf90 pda0 5 pda1 pda4 the lower transmission for longer pda coating could be attributed to two effects provided by the pda coating firstly the increase in pda density with longer coating time as observed in tem micrographs fig 2b and indicated by the decrease of pure water permeance table 2 would enhance the size sieving effect for hydrophobic compounds this is also supported by kasemset et al 2017 who observed a decrease in nominal pore size of pda layers from 4 3 to 3 7 nm for 1 to 4 hours coating on ultrafiltration membrane substrates secondly the increase in membrane hydrophilicity with a longer coating time reduces the hydrophobic adsorption of hydrophobic compounds guo et al 2016 both hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic compounds show a general transmission trend of nf90 pda1 pda4 pda0 5 fig 5 a and b the similar response of the moderately hydrophobic compounds and hydrophilic compounds to pda coated membranes indicates that the moderately hydrophobic compounds behave more like hydrophilic compounds when interacting with pda layers indeed as discussed in section 3 2 1 both size sieving effect and hydrophobic interaction may play roles in the transmission of moderately hydrophobic compounds in addition the transmissions of moderately hydrophobic compounds tend to stabilize relatively quickly as for hydrophilic compounds fig s4 a and b thus for the convenience of discussion the neutral compounds with logd 3 can be considered as functionally hydrophilic from this point on among the three pda coated membranes pda1 consistently shows the highest transmission for hydrophilic compounds fig 5 a and b to explain this trend it is necessary to consider that a surface coating can provide competing features that would affect solute transmission a coating layer may seal defects which reduces transmission or may provide an unstirred layer which leads to cake enhanced concentration polarization cecp and increased transmission the relative magnitude of these effects would depend on the properties of the coating such as thickness density pore size and hydrophilicity thus it is proposed that the relatively higher transmission for pda1 and pda4 can be potentially explained by cecp since the pda layer may have a larger effective pore size than nf90 kasemset et al 2017 nghiem et al 2004 hydrophilic compounds can enter this relatively loose coating and be partially rejected by the denser polyamide layer causing a local accumulation of these compounds in the pda coating which is analogous to the concentration polarization in an unstirred cake layer on the other hand pda0 5 would experience less severe cecp due to its thinner coating layer the lowest transmission by pda0 5 could most likely be attributed to the sealing of defects which have been identified as a common issue for polyamide nf ro membranes song et al 2020 defect sealing does not require a large amount of deposition but could eliminate the hotspots for solutes to readily transport through the membrane resulting in a lower transmission to all compounds for longer coating times pda4 a denser pda layer is formed as observed in tem micrographs fig 2b and kasemset et al 2017 a denser pda layer could improve the size exclusion effect and therefore reduce the cecp of hydrophilic compounds azais et al 2016 to further understand the effects provided by pda coatings the reduction in mean transmission of neutral compounds by pda coated membranes compared to nf90 is calculated fig 6 each pda coated membrane shows a general trend of increasing transmission reduction with the increase of vdw radius although the molecular geometry and hydrophilicity may also be contributory factors this implies that the pda coatings are more effective in size excluding larger compounds among the hydrophilic compounds atrazine 71 1 carbamazepine 78 2 primidone 75 6 and diazepam 79 3 have very high transmission reductions by pda0 5 interestingly the differences in transmission reduction between pda0 5 and pda1 pda4 of these compounds appear to be smaller than the differences for small hydrophilic compounds e g paracetamol propylparaben diuron see details in table s3 given the cecp effect discussed above the difference of transmission reduction between pda0 5 and pda1 pda4 could reveal the extent of cecp thus this comparison indicates that the cecp effect could be more pronounced for small hydrophilic compounds this may also explain why the transmission of the two smallest hydrophilic compounds benzotriazole and 5 methylbenzotriazole by pda1 is higher than by nf90 on the contrary for hydrophobic compounds the smallest compound phenylphenol shows a difference in transmission reduction between three pda coated membranes much smaller than the differences between the three membranes for larger compounds it is worthwhile to note that the cecp effect is less important for the hydrophobic compounds due to their exclusion by size and hydrophilicity thus the distinction between large and small hydrophobic compounds indicates that the suppression of hydrophobic adsorption and the enhanced size exclusion by the densified pda layer have a limited effect on small hydrophobic compounds e g vdw radius 3 5 å 3 3 removal of charged compounds the removal mechanisms of charged compounds by nf ro membranes include electrostatic repulsion and donnan exclusion size exclusion and hydrophobic interaction khanzada et al 2020 kim et al 2018 for nf90 the majority of negatively charged compounds have transmissions lower than 1 and was weakly correlated with the mw and vdw radius fig 7 for example large compounds such as pfoa and diclofenac have higher transmission than the smallest compound saccharin fig 7 compared to neutral compounds saccharin has a much lower transmission by nf90 than neutral hydrophilic paracetamol which has a similar vdw radius this highlights the importance of electrostatic repulsion in the removal of smaller negatively charged compounds however also similar in vdw radius the second smallest compound in the negatively charged category sulfamethoxazole 0 33 by nf90 only has a marginal difference in transmission compared to neutral hydrophilic primidone 0 93 by nf90 this implies that size sieving is also important for removing charged compounds of different sizes pfoa is an outlier and shows higher transmission than other negatively charged compounds by nf90 despite its large mw for perfluorinated compounds non electrostatic adsorption could play a role in facilitating transmission li et al 2021 although pfoa is negatively charged at neutral ph the chemical structure has a long carbon fluorine chain with a carboxylic acid ending group adsorption onto the membrane could occur at the uncharged carbon end steinle darling and reinhard 2008 the transport of pfoa through the membrane may further take advantage of this orientation and pass through the membrane pores via the minimum projection area table1 this may explain why the transmission of pfoa is higher than other negatively charged compounds a similar argument may apply to pfos for positively charged compounds the transmission is clearly higher than negatively charged compounds of similar mws by nf90 and the transmission appears to decrease with mw the same trend has also been observed elsewhere albergamo et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the higher transmissions are probably due to the fact that positively charged compounds pass more easily through the membrane with a net negative charge by electrostatic attraction the main mechanisms to retain these compounds in the feed are via the donnan effect and size exclusion bellona et al 2004 ouyang et al 2019 in general the pda coated membranes show lower transmissions than nf90 although nf90 has the greatest negative charge table 2 pda0 5 and pda4 have lower transmission of all the charged compounds this can be explained by electrostatic repulsion combined with the defect sealing effect by pda coating as discussed above comparing the three pda coated membranes the transmission of charged compounds consistently follows the order of pda1 pda0 5 pda4 which is well correlated with the zeta potential measurements the average transmission reduction by pda0 5 ranges from 22 0 sulfamethoxazole to 53 8 atenolol and the average transmission reduction by pda4 ranges from 62 1 pfoa to 82 1 trimethoprim compared to neutral compounds the transmission reduction does not show a correlation with molecular size and most of the charged compounds can be considered hydrophilic compounds table1 thus the lower transmission by pda4 could most likely be attributed to its greater negative charge at the feed ph yang et al 2017 pda1 with the least negative charge at feed ph has the highest transmission of charged compounds among the three pda coated membranes and several transmissions are slightly higher than the transmissions by nf90 this indicates that although pda coating hinders the transmission of charged compounds by sealing defects the decrease of surface charge by pda1 could facilitate the transmission of charged compounds due to weakened electrostatic repulsion it is worth noting that the transmissions of charged compounds by nf90 and pda coated nf90 are all very low which comes as no surprise since polyamide nf ro membranes are designed to highly remove ionic solutes 4 conclusions we have systematically characterised the properties of nf90 and pda coated nf90 membranes and compared their transmission of 34 oms at constant permeate flux from 0 5 to 4 hours of pda deposition the pda coating became thicker denser and more hydrophilic the negative surface charge of pda coated membranes showed the lowest value at pda1 and then increased to the highest at pda4 although all pda coated membranes had less negative charge than nf90 the following correlations between the changes of membrane characteristics and solute transmission can be concluded the deposition of the pda layer can seal the defects in the polyamide matrix resulting in lower transmission to all oms for neutral compounds larger compounds appear to have greater transmission reduction by the pda coatings the increase in membrane hydrophilicity for longer pda coating results in different responses between neutral hydrophilic compounds and neutral hydrophobic compounds increasing membrane hydrophilicity reduces the hydrophobic adsorption of neutral hydrophobic compounds resulting in lower transmission however for neutral hydrophilic compounds the hydrophilic pda coating layer can induce cake enhanced concentration polarization cecp which tends to increase the transmission the effects provided by changing membrane surface hydrophilicity appear to be solute size dependent reducing the hydrophobic adsorption is limited for smaller neutral hydrophobic compounds and the cecp effect is more pronounced for smaller neutral hydrophilic compounds in general the transmissions of charged compounds by nf90 and pda coated membranes are very low in addition to defect sealing the higher surface negative charge by pda4 results in lower transmissions of charged compounds overall the pda coating of nf90 membranes improves its ability to remove a wide range of neutral hydrophilic phobic and charged organic micropollutants the coatings lead to competing solute membrane interactions where the net effect determines transmission in this study the optimum coating is identified as pda4 which showed the lowest transmissions to neutral hydrophobic compounds and charged compounds and slightly higher transmissions to neutral hydrophilic compounds than pda0 5 the coating only caused a modest 26 4 drop in water permeance which is still at 7 0 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 this study provides fundamental insights

polydopamine pda as a model coating to comprehensively link the changes in membrane properties with the changes in transmission of 34 oms the membrane characterization demonstrated that a thicker denser and more hydrophilic pda coating can be achieved by increasing the pda deposition time from 0 5 to 4 hours overall the transmissions of target oms were reduced by pda coated nf membranes compared to unmodified nf membranes the neutral hydrophobic compounds showed lower transmissions for longer pda coating pda4 while the neutral hydrophilic compounds tended to show lower transmissions for shorter pda coating pda0 5 to explain this competing effects provided by the pda coatings are proposed including sealing defects inducing cake enhanced concentration polarization in the coating layer for neutral hydrophilic compounds and weakened hydrophobic adsorption for neutral hydrophobic compounds for charged compounds pda4 with the greatest negative charge among the pda coated membranes showed the lowest transmission depending on the molecular size and hydrophilicity of the compounds the transmission of oms by the pda4 coating could be reduced by 70 with only a 26 4 decline in water permeance the correlations and mechanistic insights provided by this work are highly useful for designing membranes with specific surface properties via surface modification to improve the removal of oms without compromising water production graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nanofiltration membrane surface modification organic micropollutants solute transport 1 introduction the nanofiltration nf membrane process has been widely used in drinking water production wastewater tertiary treatment and wastewater reuse however its inadequate removal of organic micropollutants oms especially some neutrally charged small organic compounds has hindered its applications bellona et al 2012 van der bruggen et al 2008 oms also interchangeably referred to as trace organics or contaminants of emerging concern cover a wide range of contaminants such as pharmaceuticals personal care products pesticides household products and industrial chemicals that have been ubiquitously detected in the aquatic environment at trace levels ng l to a few μg l ebele et al 2017 luo et al 2014 depending on the concentration and frequency exposure to these chemicals can result in adverse effects such as disrupting endocrine systems and inducing cancers and lethal effects on aquatic organisms and or human consumers bolong et al 2009 shao et al 2019 one of the main sources of oms entering the aquatic environment is via wastewater effluent discharge since the current wastewater treatment plants wwtps are not designed to efficiently remove oms khanzada et al 2020 luo et al 2014 accordingly some wwtps employ nf units as tertiary treatment to further remove oms garcia ivars et al 2017 in another scenario the current indirect potable reuse scheme uses reverse osmosis ro as an absolute barrier and expects to fully remove all contaminants from wastewater drewes et al 2005 some studies have proposed the use of nf in this role in lieu of ro due to its higher water permeability which would lead to lower energy consumption bellona et al 2012 mohammad et al 2015 yangali quintanilla et al 2010 although tight nf membranes have shown only a slightly lower rejection of oms than ro membranes neither of them can fully remove all oms yangali quintanilla et al 2010 thus for both scenarios improving the rejection of oms by nf while keeping the high water permeability is of great interest surface modification has been reported as a promising method to improve the rejection of oms by membranes khanzada et al 2020 kim et al 2018 kim et al 2008 reported the use of graft polymerization on nf membranes to improve the rejection of bisphenol a ibuprofen and salicylic acid similarly two other reagents for surface grafting were applied in another study and the rejections of bisphenol a and metolachlor by modified nf270 membranes were improved ben david et al 2010 another group attempted to modify a commercial low pressure ro lpro membrane using a grafting method baransi karkaby et al 2019 however due to the existing high rejection of the three contaminants carbamazepine bisphenol a and acetaminophen by the pristine lpro membrane the improvement was marginal guo et al applied hydrophilic polydopamine pda coating and pda agnps coating on nf membranes to improve the rejection of four hydrophobic endocrine disrupting compounds edcs guo et al 2016 guo et al 2017 liu et al 2019 grafted hydrophilic diethanolamine and monoethanolamine on in house nf membranes which resulted in increased water permeability reduced nacl rejection and negligible change in rejection of eight oms although these prior studies showed incremental improvements in separation and in some cases increased rejection of oms they were limited in scope the motivation for this study is that oms consist of a broad class of chemicals with varying molecular size hydrophilicity pka toxicity and upstream removal efficiency by current in house treatments improving the rejection of one category of oms by changing membrane surface properties may result in detrimental changes for other categories importantly a clear correlation between membrane properties and the physiochemical properties of a wide range of oms that are present in the environment is needed the principle of surface modification to improve the rejection of oms by nf ro membranes relies on tailoring the removal mechanisms of organic solutes by membranes including by size exclusion electrostatic repulsion donnan exclusion effect and hydrophobic interaction bellona et al 2004 khanzada et al 2020 kim et al 2018 for instance bellona et al 2004 proposed a rejection diagram to predict the rejection efficiency of oms depending on the oms and membrane properties from the perspective of membrane properties the diagram demonstrated how the membrane pore size and the surface charge can affect the rejection of organic solutes increasing the surface charge would increase the rejection of charged compounds by enhancing electrostatic repulsion kim et al 2008 yang et al 2017 smaller membrane pore size would increase the rejection of all compounds by enhancing size exclusion but would also result in a decline of water permeability liu et al 2019 in terms of surface interactions most of the current nf ro membranes have a hydrophobic polyamide separation layer that can induce adsorption of hydrophobic oms and result in lower rejection kimura et al 2003 nghiem et al 2004 thus membrane hydrophilicity has become an important property of membranes for modification for example guo et al 2016 demonstrated that a hydrophilic coating could weaken the hydrophobic adsorption of neutral hydrophobic oms which contributed to higher rejection rates of four hydrophobic compounds however the effect of a hydrophilic coating on the transport of hydrophilic oms remains unknown in this work we have used hydrophilic pda as a model coating to comprehensively correlate the modified membrane properties to the changes in transmission of 34 oms in previous works pda coating has shown good hydrophilic properties lee et al 2007 adhesive ability lee et al 2007 li et al 2009 and antifouling properties karkhanechi et al 2014 mccloskey et al 2012 which makes it a promising polymer for membrane surface modification liu et al 2014 nf90 was selected as the target membrane for modification due to its potential to replace ro membranes in indirect potable reuse yangali quintanilla et al 2010 in addition the separation layer of nf90 is made by interfacial polymerization of trimesoyl chloride and m phenylenediamine which is also the benchmark chemistry for most ro membranes this might expand the implications of this work to broader applications membrane properties including membrane morphology surface roughness membrane chemistry surface hydrophilicity surface charge water permeability and salt rejection were systematically characterised the filtration experiments used a mixture of 34 oms which have been frequently detected in wastewater effluents luo et al 2014 and vary in molecular size hydrophilicity and charge tests were conducted at environmentally relevant feed concentrations and typical filtration conditions in general the removal of the 34 oms was improved by applying pda coatings for different coating durations and an optimal coating time is identified a comprehensive discussion relating the improvements in the removal of oms to the change of membrane properties is provided in this paper 2 materials and methods 2 1

filtration protocol a bench scale filtration system made of stainless steel was constructed to conduct the filtration experiments of oms fig 1 the system allowed the permeate to be circulated back to the feed tank to maintain the feed concentrations of oms a large quantity of feed water 30 l was used to minimise the change of feed concentration due to sampling the crossflow membrane cell had a 137

the permeate flow transducer the retentate valve was automatically controlled based on the set value and feedback from the retentate flow transducer all controls were set and monitored by software

biosystems foster city ca usa the detailed lc ms ms methods and the limits of reporting lor that were determined experimentally are provided in table s1 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane characterization 3 1 1 membrane morphology the morphology of pristine nf90 observed by both sem and tem micrographs fig 2 is consistent with previous studies song et al 2020 yan et al 2019 the polyamide rejection layer consists of an interior section of typical nodular protuberances containing nanovoids and an interconnected and relatively flat exterior layer the exterior layer has some crater like regions due to the incomplete coverage the intrinsic thickness of these polyamide films i e the true film thickness excluding voids is 10 to 20 nm which is much thinner compared to the height of the nodular layer the apparent thickness of 150 to 200 nm fig 2b nf90 for pda coated membranes the tem micrographs show that the rejection layers tend to have a greater apparent thickness 300 to 400 nm compared to the pristine nf90 membrane which is very likely due to the deposition of pda fig 2 in addition some of the voids appear to be partially filled particularly at longer coating durations e g 2 and 4 h resulting in a denser appearance for pda2 and pda4 the sem micrographs show a progressive enrichment of pda nanoparticles on the polyamide surface from pda0 5 to pda4 but in general the membranes retain many of their original features e g nodules and crater like regions although the exact formation mechanism of pda is still an ongoing debate it is generally believed that dopamine is oxidized into different building blocks such as catechol amine quinone and indole and then forms aggregates oligomers depending on the proposed mechanisms in the bulk solution over time liu et al 2014 ryu et al 2018 the aggregates oligomers and single building blocks then adhere to the substrate by hydrogen bonding π stacking charge transfer etc the increasing appearance of pda nanoparticles on the nf90 surface with a longer coating time may indicate that more functional groups from pda were deposited onto the membrane surface the pda coatings had only a modest effect 20 on the surface roughness fig 2c and table s2 probably due to the rough nature of the underlying polyamide film 3 1 2 membrane chemistry to further confirm the deposition of pda layers the chemistry of the membranes was analysed by xps and atr ftir the atr ftir results fig s2 confirm the chemistry of nf90 all the peaks match a typical fully aromatic polyamide membrane reported previously tang et al 2009 no distinguishable ftir peaks for the pda coating are observed due to the relatively deep penetration depth 200 nm and the chemical similarity of pda to the membrane matrix however the xps scans a sample within less than 10 nm penetration depth which means that the xps results fig 3 are more surface sensitive for the detection of pda coating as shown in fig 3 f the oxygen content increases from 14 6 to 21 3 by increasing coating time from 0 to 4 hours while the nitrogen content decreases from 13 5 to 8 5 the o n ratio increases from 1 09 to 2 52 and the n c ratio decreases from 0 19 to 0 12 the high resolution scans of oxygen spectra fig 3 a b c d e show an increase of the o c functional group from 24 2 to 55 5 the nitrogen spectra fig s5 also show an increasing peak of the n r functional group with coating time these results confirm that pda was successfully coated on the membrane interestingly the o n ratio of pda4 exceeds 2 which is often considered as the theoretical o n ratio of pda coating liebscher et al 2013 wang et al 2019 many other studies have also observed the o n ratio of pda can exceed 2 karkhanechi et al 2014 patel et al 2018 wang et al 2016 this may be explained by the formation of carboxyl groups in the pda structure della vecchia et al 2013 or the covalent incorporation of the tris molecule containing three hydroxyl functional groups into the pda matrix fig s6 and patel et al 2018 more information can be obtained from the xps results when compared with the reported xps results of pure pda samples rella et al 2018 investigated the pda structure using the same coating method but on gold sheets and glass slides in their study pda coating time was from 1 to 5 hours and they found 1 the o c of oxygen content increased from 2 09 to 49 34 2 the o c decreased from 97 91 to 50 6 and 3 the n c ratio increased from 0 092 to 0 101 in comparison only pda2 and pda4 in our work show an o c percentage that is within the o c range from their results and only pda4 shows an n c ratio that is close to their 0 101 at 5 hour coating this means that the xps scans of pda2 and pda4 are more likely to characterise the dominant pda layer while scans of pda0 5 and pda1 are likely to characterise the combined presence of the pda and polyamide thus it is reasonable to conclude that a thicker xps penetration depth and fully covered pda layer was developed in pda2 and pda4 comparatively pda0 5 and pda1 had a relatively thin pda layers or incomplete coverage of pda on the membrane due to the rough surface of nf90 3 1 3 membrane hydrophilicity and surface charge the membrane hydrophilicity was characterised by wca table 2 which steadily decreased from 68 4 to 47 3 by increasing pda coating time this is in good agreement with both sem and tem observations and xps characterization as discussed above the increase of hydrophilicity could be attributed to the increased deposition of hydrophilic moieties from pda especially the hydroxyl functional groups e g increasing oxygen content and increasing percentage of o c from xps results lee et al 2007 liu et al 2014 zeta potentials of different membranes are presented in table 2 and fig s8 all samples show a positive charge at low ph and a negative charge at high ph fig s8 since both polyamide and pda have amine groups and hydroxyl carboxyl groups fig s6 the pristine nf90 consistently shows a greater negative charge than the pda coated membranes at ph around 7 this could be due to the coverage of the carboxyl groups in the polyamide matrix by pda with hydroxyl groups the carboxyl group on an aromatic ring has a pka in water lower than 4 jover et al 2008 whereas the hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring has a pka in the water around 10 gross and seybold 2001 thus at ph around 7 the pristine nf90 with more carboxyl groups exposed at the surface would be more likely to have deprotonated moieties providing a more net negative charge at ph higher than 10 the pda coated membranes show similar or slightly more negative values than nf90 fig s8 which supports this explanation because each pda monomer could have two deprotonated hydroxyl groups fig s6 among pda coated membranes pda2 and pda4 have greater negative charges compared to pda0 5 and pda1 at ph 7 table 2 the greater negative charge may be due to the possible formation of carboxyl groups during the longer time oxidation of pda as mentioned in section 3 1 2 della vecchia et al 2013 3 2 removal of neutral compounds 3 2 1 removal of neutral compounds by nf90 according to the solution diffusion theory solute transport through a membrane is governed by both the solubility of the compound in the membrane material and its diffusion inside the membranes obviously the solubility sorption by the membrane depends on solute membrane interactions including size exclusion hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic repulsion at the same time the solute diffusion inside of the membrane is also affected by these interactions for example one would expect slower solute diffusion under stronger size exclusion effect i e for smaller membrane pore size or larger solute size the main removal mechanisms of nf ro membranes against neutral oms are size exclusion and hydrophilic hydrophobic interactions bellona et al 2004 khanzada et al 2020 kim et al 2018 thus it is imperative to understand the role played by the two mechanisms in removing oms with varying physiochemical properties on the base pristine nf90 membrane fig 4 presents the transmission of neutral compounds by nf90 correlated to mw and molecular dimensions the neutral oms are classified into three categories hydrophilic compounds logd 2 moderately hydrophobic compounds 2 logd 3 and hydrophobic compounds logd 3 as shown in fig 4 a and b the hydrophilic compounds exhibit clear trends the transmissions decrease with increase in molecular weight mw and van der waals vdw radius this agrees with previous studies which proposed that the main removal mechanism of neutral hydrophilic compounds is by size exclusion albergamo et al 2019 fujioka et al 2014 in contrast the transmissions of moderately hydrophobic and hydrophobic compounds tend to show higher transmissions compared to their hydrophilic counterparts of similar mw or vdw high transmissions of diuron linuron triclosan and triclocarban have also been observed in other studies fujioka et al 2014 fujioka et al 2015 nghiem and coleman 2008 the higher transmissions could be attributed to the hydrophobic adsorption of these compounds onto the relatively hydrophobic polyamide membrane followed by diffusion and or convection kim et al 2007 kimura et al 2003 nghiem and coleman 2008 nghiem et al 2004 given that many studies have suggested that the use of vdw radius or stokes radius to correlate solute transmission may be inaccurate due to the assumption of spherical shape alturki et al 2010 bellona et al 2004 fujioka et al 2014 yang et al 2017 we also present the correlation of transmission with minimum and maximum projection radius fig 4c and d it has been suggested in many studies that minimum projection area is a better correlator to the rejection of organic compound fujioka et al 2018 shin et al 2022 the maximum projection radius shows poor correlation with the transmission of all neutral compounds conversely three moderately hydrophobic compounds propylparaben diuron and linuron show a better transmission trend when the transmissions are arranged by the minimum projection radius nevertheless the minimum projection radius is not a universal correlator as paracetamol and phenylphenol dramatically deviate from the trend in fig 4c although they fit well with the vdw radius trends fig 4b moreover propylparaben and diuron have very similar minimum projection radius but propylparaben has a much higher transmission thus in addition to hydrophobic adsorption the relatively higher transmission of moderately hydrophobic compounds particularly diuron and linuron may be also partially due to their elongated ellipsoid or cuboid shapes and orientation during transport for hydrophobic compounds neither of the minimum or maximum projection radius shows a preferable trend two hydrophobic compounds triclosan and triclocarban consistently show higher transmissions than other compounds with similar mw or size triclosan and triclocarban have the two highest logd values among all the neutral compounds and could have a greater extent of adsorption and partitioning through the membrane this supports the view that hydrophobic interaction may play a dominant role in the transmission of hydrophobic compounds 3 2 2 the effect of pda coating on the removal of neutral compounds for all neutral compounds the pda coated membranes show reduced transmission compared to nf90 except the transmissions of benzotriazole and 5 methylbenzotriazole by pda1 fig 5 the transmission reduction by pda coated membranes appears to be more obvious for hydrophobic compounds fig 5c and the transmissions of hydrophobic compounds rank in the order nf90 pda0 5 pda1 pda4 the lower transmission for longer pda coating could be attributed to two effects provided by the pda coating firstly the increase in pda density with longer coating time as observed in tem micrographs fig 2b and indicated by the decrease of pure water permeance table 2 would enhance the size sieving effect for hydrophobic compounds this is also supported by kasemset et al 2017 who observed a decrease in nominal pore size of pda layers from 4 3 to 3 7 nm for 1 to 4 hours coating on ultrafiltration membrane substrates secondly the increase in membrane hydrophilicity with a longer coating time reduces the hydrophobic adsorption of hydrophobic compounds guo et al 2016 both hydrophilic and moderately hydrophobic compounds show a general transmission trend of nf90 pda1 pda4 pda0 5 fig 5 a and b the similar response of the moderately hydrophobic compounds and hydrophilic compounds to pda coated membranes indicates that the moderately hydrophobic compounds behave more like hydrophilic compounds when interacting with pda layers indeed as discussed in section 3 2 1 both size sieving effect and hydrophobic interaction may play roles in the transmission of moderately hydrophobic compounds in addition the transmissions of moderately hydrophobic compounds tend to stabilize relatively quickly as for hydrophilic compounds fig s4 a and b thus for the convenience of discussion the neutral compounds with logd 3 can be considered as functionally hydrophilic from this point on among the three pda coated membranes pda1 consistently shows the highest transmission for hydrophilic compounds fig 5 a and b to explain this trend it is necessary to consider that a surface coating can provide competing features that would affect solute transmission a coating layer may seal defects which reduces transmission or may provide an unstirred layer which leads to cake enhanced concentration polarization cecp and increased transmission the relative magnitude of these effects would depend on the properties of the coating such as thickness density pore size and hydrophilicity thus it is proposed that the relatively higher transmission for pda1 and pda4 can be potentially explained by cecp since the pda layer may have a larger effective pore size than nf90 kasemset et al 2017 nghiem et al 2004 hydrophilic compounds can enter this relatively loose coating and be partially rejected by the denser polyamide layer causing a local accumulation of these compounds in the pda coating which is analogous to the concentration polarization in an unstirred cake layer on the other hand pda0 5 would experience less severe cecp due to its thinner coating layer the lowest transmission by pda0 5 could most likely be attributed to the sealing of defects which have been identified as a common issue for polyamide nf ro membranes song et al 2020 defect sealing does not require a large amount of deposition but could eliminate the hotspots for solutes to readily transport through the membrane resulting in a lower transmission to all compounds for longer coating times pda4 a denser pda layer is formed as observed in tem micrographs fig 2b and kasemset et al 2017 a denser pda layer could improve the size exclusion effect and therefore reduce the cecp of hydrophilic compounds azais et al 2016 to further understand the effects provided by pda coatings the reduction in mean transmission of neutral compounds by pda coated membranes compared to nf90 is calculated fig 6 each pda coated membrane shows a general trend of increasing transmission reduction with the increase of vdw radius although the molecular geometry and hydrophilicity may also be contributory factors this implies that the pda coatings are more effective in size excluding larger compounds among the hydrophilic compounds atrazine 71 1 carbamazepine 78 2 primidone 75 6 and diazepam 79 3 have very high transmission reductions by pda0 5 interestingly the differences in transmission reduction between pda0 5 and pda1 pda4 of these compounds appear to be smaller than the differences for small hydrophilic compounds e g paracetamol propylparaben diuron see details in table s3 given the cecp effect discussed above the difference of transmission reduction between pda0 5 and pda1 pda4 could reveal the extent of cecp thus this comparison indicates that the cecp effect could be more pronounced for small hydrophilic compounds this may also explain why the transmission of the two smallest hydrophilic compounds benzotriazole and 5 methylbenzotriazole by pda1 is higher than by nf90 on the contrary for hydrophobic compounds the smallest compound phenylphenol shows a difference in transmission reduction between three pda coated membranes much smaller than the differences between the three membranes for larger compounds it is worthwhile to note that the cecp effect is less important for the hydrophobic compounds due to their exclusion by size and hydrophilicity thus the distinction between large and small hydrophobic compounds indicates that the suppression of hydrophobic adsorption and the enhanced size exclusion by the densified pda layer have a limited effect on small hydrophobic compounds e g vdw radius 3 5 å 3 3 removal of charged compounds the removal mechanisms of charged compounds by nf ro membranes include electrostatic repulsion and donnan exclusion size exclusion and hydrophobic interaction khanzada et al 2020 kim et al 2018 for nf90 the majority of negatively charged compounds have transmissions lower than 1 and was weakly correlated with the mw and vdw radius fig 7 for example large compounds such as pfoa and diclofenac have higher transmission than the smallest compound saccharin fig 7 compared to neutral compounds saccharin has a much lower transmission by nf90 than neutral hydrophilic paracetamol which has a similar vdw radius this highlights the importance of electrostatic repulsion in the removal of smaller negatively charged compounds however also similar in vdw radius the second smallest compound in the negatively charged category sulfamethoxazole 0 33 by nf90 only has a marginal difference in transmission compared to neutral hydrophilic primidone 0 93 by nf90 this implies that size sieving is also important for removing charged compounds of different sizes pfoa is an outlier and shows higher transmission than other negatively charged compounds by nf90 despite its large mw for perfluorinated compounds non electrostatic adsorption could play a role in facilitating transmission li et al 2021 although pfoa is negatively charged at neutral ph the chemical structure has a long carbon fluorine chain with a carboxylic acid ending group adsorption onto the membrane could occur at the uncharged carbon end steinle darling and reinhard 2008 the transport of pfoa through the membrane may further take advantage of this orientation and pass through the membrane pores via the minimum projection area table1 this may explain why the transmission of pfoa is higher than other negatively charged compounds a similar argument may apply to pfos for positively charged compounds the transmission is clearly higher than negatively charged compounds of similar mws by nf90 and the transmission appears to decrease with mw the same trend has also been observed elsewhere albergamo et al 2019 liu et al 2019 the higher transmissions are probably due to the fact that positively charged compounds pass more easily through the membrane with a net negative charge by electrostatic attraction the main mechanisms to retain these compounds in the feed are via the donnan effect and size exclusion bellona et al 2004 ouyang et al 2019 in general the pda coated membranes show lower transmissions than nf90 although nf90 has the greatest negative charge table 2 pda0 5 and pda4 have lower transmission of all the charged compounds this can be explained by electrostatic repulsion combined with the defect sealing effect by pda coating as discussed above comparing the three pda coated membranes the transmission of charged compounds consistently follows the order of pda1 pda0 5 pda4 which is well correlated with the zeta potential measurements the average transmission reduction by pda0 5 ranges from 22 0 sulfamethoxazole to 53 8 atenolol and the average transmission reduction by pda4 ranges from 62 1 pfoa to 82 1 trimethoprim compared to neutral compounds the transmission reduction does not show a correlation with molecular size and most of the charged compounds can be considered hydrophilic compounds table1 thus the lower transmission by pda4 could most likely be attributed to its greater negative charge at the feed ph yang et al 2017 pda1 with the least negative charge at feed ph has the highest transmission of charged compounds among the three pda coated membranes and several transmissions are slightly higher than the transmissions by nf90 this indicates that although pda coating hinders the transmission of charged compounds by sealing defects the decrease of surface charge by pda1 could facilitate the transmission of charged compounds due to weakened electrostatic repulsion it is worth noting that the transmissions of charged compounds by nf90 and pda coated nf90 are all very low which comes as no surprise since polyamide nf ro membranes are designed to highly remove ionic solutes 4 conclusions we have systematically characterised the properties of nf90 and pda coated nf90 membranes and compared their transmission of 34 oms at constant permeate flux from 0 5 to 4 hours of pda deposition the pda coating became thicker denser and more hydrophilic the negative surface charge of pda coated membranes showed the lowest value at pda1 and then increased to the highest at pda4 although all pda coated membranes had less negative charge than nf90 the following correlations between the changes of membrane characteristics and solute transmission can be concluded the deposition of the pda layer can seal the defects in the polyamide matrix resulting in lower transmission to all oms for neutral compounds larger compounds appear to have greater transmission reduction by the pda coatings the increase in membrane hydrophilicity for longer pda coating results in different responses between neutral hydrophilic compounds and neutral hydrophobic compounds increasing membrane hydrophilicity reduces the hydrophobic adsorption of neutral hydrophobic compounds resulting in lower transmission however for neutral hydrophilic compounds the hydrophilic pda coating layer can induce cake enhanced concentration polarization cecp which tends to increase the transmission the effects provided by changing membrane surface hydrophilicity appear to be solute size dependent reducing the hydrophobic adsorption is limited for smaller neutral hydrophobic compounds and the cecp effect is more pronounced for smaller neutral hydrophilic compounds in general the transmissions of charged compounds by nf90 and pda coated membranes are very low in addition to defect sealing the higher surface negative charge by pda4 results in lower transmissions of charged compounds overall the pda coating of nf90 membranes improves its ability to remove a wide range of neutral hydrophilic phobic and charged organic micropollutants the coatings lead to competing solute membrane interactions where the net effect determines transmission in this study the optimum coating is identified as pda4 which showed the lowest transmissions to neutral hydrophobic compounds and charged compounds and slightly higher transmissions to neutral hydrophilic compounds than pda0 5 the coating only caused a modest 26 4 drop in water permeance which is still at 7 0 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 this study provides fundamental insights into tailoring the nf membrane properties via surface modification to improve the removal of oms declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16712,in low and middle income countries the provisioning of safe drinking water is a challenge that will likely worsen with climate change securing water will require more work and time burdening women and children the most currently the consequences of this time burden to children s development remain understudied to address this gap we examine the tradeoff between children s household water collection responsibilities and learning achievement using nationally representative data from india we measure the effect of daily fetching time on primary school children s learning achievement in a two stage regression model with rainfall as the instrument our analyses indicate that higher fetching times predict lower mathematics 1 23 standard deviations 95ci 2 32 0 14 reading 1 13 standard deviations 95ci 2 07 0 19 and writing 1 21 standard deviations 95ci 1 89 0 51 test scores these effects are heterogeneous across sex and infrastructure type for example we find girls mathematical and

absence of piped to premises water in water insecure contexts and offer guidance for targeting infrastructure investments in india graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water infrastructure instrumental variable analysis domestic water policy climate related water security human capital development 1 introduction water is foundational for health and development and its deprivation prevents the realization of a range of human needs and rights currently in low and middle income settings over 780 million people lack access to safe drinking water world health organization 2019 as water insecurity worsens due to climate change young et al 2019 securing water will require more work and time while the health effects of poor access to water on childhood illness and mortality gera et al 2018 pickering and davis 2012 ravallion and jalan 1999 are well documented the broader social implications of the time burden of collection are comparatively understudied boone et al 2011 given that women and children particularly young girls are often responsible for water collection graham et al 2016 this time burden may be costly for children s development the time burden of water fetching can be understood in terms of tradeoffs often referred to as time poverty this burden is one of competing claims on individuals time that reduce their ability to make unconstrained choices on how they allocate their time wodon and blackden 2006 p 16 while no choice is completely unconstrained phelan and link 2013 this definition is helpful as it highlights the finite nature of time in the short term with each day limited to twenty four hours individuals must decide between daily activities for many children this tradeoff is between school market work and household chores such as water collection their levels of engagement across these categories are determined by other household members tradeoffs wodon and blackden 2006 both of which are products of sociocultural conditions surrounding the division of labor and importance of education among other norms coon 2016 masuda and cook 2013 depending on these norms and households resources displacing children s education may be necessary for families to meet basic needs in households facing severe time constraints children may drop out of school khanam and ross 2011 wodon and blackden 2006 in households that are less time poor children may not regularly attend school or may be expected to work rather than study outside of school hours akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 in either situation improving households access to basic infrastructure services especially water infrastructure may help promote children s education by reducing the time burden of domestic labor and lessening the necessity of tradeoffs with schooling koolwal and van de walle 2013 as with all child labor children s involvement in water collection can prejudice their participation in school akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 beegle et al 2009 lancaster and ray 2004 ray and lancaster 2005 nankhuni and findeis 2004 illustrate this tradeoff clearly among urban and rural households in malawi they found the more hours children aged six to fourteen dedicated to fetching water the less likely they were to attend school with a lower likelihood for those with piped water access similarly haile and haile 2012 showed that among rural ethiopian children aged seven to fifteen girls were more likely to fetch water than boys and increasing the distance to a water source a proxy for collection time reduced the likelihood of attending school it is worth noting that these two studies represent the smaller body of research that focuses on children s school participation and their own water collection as opposed to other household members water collection responsibilities e g ilahi 2001 koolwal and van de walle 2013 nauges and strand 2013 children s water collection responsibilities may also limit academic performance though there is comparatively less evidence to support this link the general consensus is that child labor in and outside of the household can adversely affect learning outcomes albeit the latter is considered more harmful to children s development beegle et al 2009 canagarajah and coulombe 1999 khanam and ross 2011 ravallion and wodon 1999 sanchez et al 2005 illustratively a study in ghana showed that work outside of the household was statistically significantly associated with learning achievement in reading and mathematics among children aged nine to eighteen e g associated with a ten percent reduction in an elementary mathematics test score the significance of the effect of work at home was unclear heady 2003 in a unique study focusing on children s water collection work and academic abilities among tanzanian households the authors akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 examined distance to water source as a determinant of time allocation for which they estimated the effect on reading and mathematical skills on finding evidence of a relationship between distance to water source and number of hours worked they discovered that children aged seven to fourteen worked more if the water sources were farther away which in turn was negatively related to the development of girls reading skills and boys mathematical skills akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 to our knowledge there are no other studies analyzing the effect of children s water collection on learning achievement and the akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 study has several limitations first it likely underestimated the relationship between time and learning achievement given that distance to source is only a proxy for the total time burden second the reading and mathematical ability measures were vaguely defined and based on parental judgement rather than test scores heady 2003 third the analysis examined the correlation rather than a plausibly causal relationship between water access and learning a more complete and conclusive assessment of the total burden to children s learning achievement remains to be done our paper addresses this gap by estimating the effect of decreasing the time burden of primary school children s water collection on their learning achievement using nationally representative data from india our study complements the accumulating literature examining the relationship between water and sanitation and children s cognition cameron et al 2021 choudhuri and desai in press dearden et al 2017 orgill meyer and pattanayak 2020 spears and lamba 2016 by using rigorous methods that support casual inference angrist and krueger 2001 boozer and suri 2001 maccini and yang 2009 shah and steinberg 2017 and by exploring heterogeneity in the effect of water fetching time on learning achievement across sex community caste religion economic status and water infrastructure we discuss our results and their policy relevance in light of climate related water security issues and government water priorities in india unicef 2017 2 methods 2 1 data our primary data source is the nationally representative india human development survey ihds this multi topic panel survey is organized by the university of maryland and the national council of applied economic research new delhi and was administered in 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 the survey instruments were translated into thirteen different indian languages for each round two one hour interviews were administered by local interviewers and were completed for approximately 42 000 households in 384 districts most of the same households were surveyed in both rounds children in these households aged eight through eleven completed short mathematics reading and writing tests given the seven to eight year gap between survey rounds these test scores are not panel data but instead represent the national learning achievement for students during those years in addition we use ihds measures of social and economic conditions to control for household characteristics such as education income and caste religion desai and vanneman 2018a b unfortunately data on freshwater availability in india are limited at the appropriate level of granularity and over the 2004 2012 span of interest we employ the highest resolution available monthly rainfall data in centimeters at the district level for the years 1989 2014 from the india meteorological department india meteorological department 2018 2 2 outcomes our three primary outcomes of interest are the mathematics reading and writing test scores chakraborty and jayaraman 2019 collected by the ihds for all children aged eight through eleven the tests were modeled closely after the annual status of education report aser survey cognitive tests spears and lamba 2016 the mathematics test is scored from zero to three with the levels representing the inability to do mathematics 0 and the abilities to recognize a number 1 to subtract 2 and to divide 3 the reading test is scored from zero to four with the levels representing the inability to read 0 and the abilities to read a letter 1 to read a word 2 to read a paragraph 3 and to read a story 4 the writing test is scored from zero to one with the levels representing the inability to write 0 and the ability to write with two or fewer mistakes 1 originally the ihds scored the writing test from zero to two in the 2011 2012 survey with an extra level for writing with no mistakes 1 prior to analysis we recode this variable to be binary to match the 2004 2005 survey with the writing with no mistakes level being accounted for in the writing with two or fewer mistakes level while these three tests only take integer values as scores it is reasonable to assume that the observable test performances are underlain by unobservable normal latent abilities hambleton and cook 1977 2 3 exposures our primary exposures of interest are child fetching time and freshwater availability in our data set children s fetching times are reported by their mothers as the total time daily spent collecting water by boys and or girls aged eight through eleven in the season during which the survey was completed this time includes traveling collecting and waiting in line at sources such as open wells hand pumps or tube wells freshwater availability is measured as the district level two year mean rainfall in centimeters years 2004 2005 inclusive for households in the first round and years 2010 2011 inclusive for households in the second round by constructing a two year annual mean we capture the previous year s precipitation which is an important determinant of the subsequent year s freshwater availability bhanja et al 2019 2 4 empirical framework 2 4 1 covariates we control for individual and household level covariates at the individual level we adjust for the age in years and sex dummy variable for male or female of the test taking child at the household level we include the usual drinking water source categorical variable and its location dummy variable for on or off premises table a 1 for relevant survey questions we also construct the leave out cluster mean of the location variable mean for household h over all households in a village other than h to represent village level access to water which may influence household level availability glick et al 2004 ilahi and grimard 2000 we also adjust for household monthly consumption per capita in rupees sum of monthly expenditures incurred by the household divided by the number of persons living in the household highest level of adult education in years residence location dummy variable for urban or rural and community caste religion categorical variable while there is no universally acknowledged caste hierarchy gupta 2000 based on previous literature we define the scheduled castes dalits scheduled tribes adivasis and muslims as the most underprivileged castes and religious groups and forward castes and brahmins as being among the most privileged we accord other backward castes the official term for disadvantaged castes other than scheduled castes in india a status in between zacharias and vakulabharanam 2011 2 4 2 base specification naïve model the base specification or naïve model is of the form separately for each of the three tests for child i at time t 1 y i t α β t i t γ x i t ε i t where y i t is the test score of interest mathematics reading or writing t i t is the child s total daily fetching time in minutes and x i t is a vector of individual level and household level covariates as well as time month and year of survey and district fixed effects with month dummies we adjust for seasonality and with a year dummy we control for national level trends in the outcomes with district fixed effects we account for all time invariant unobserved factors operating at the district level and force identification of within district coefficients the naïve model uses ordinary least squares estimation and serves as a point of reference for the instrumental variable model beegle et al 2009 2 4 3 instrumental variable model estimates from the naïve model are likely to be biased by omitted variables that are associated with test scores and fetching times angrist and krueger 2001 for example children in higher income households tend to work less akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 and live in contexts of better service delivery reddy 2010 however such latent characteristics are unmeasured and difficult to adjust for in a regression model with data at two time points the conventional approach for dealing with confounding in social experiments is to randomly assign the exposure of interest to a treatment group random assignment ensures that omitted variables are not associated with the exposure and outcome our use of freshwater availability precipitation is a quasi random process solves the omitted variables problem by using variation in fetching times that is not associated with omitted variables in other words to make plausibly causal inferences about the relationship between learning achievement and water fetching time we employ the instrumental variable two stage least squares estimation method pickering and davis 2012 to parse out the relationship that is independent of their endogeneity to other variables polsky and basu 2012 wooldridge 2013 pp 512 530 particularly household and institutional characteristics instrumental variables ensure that parameter estimates are consistent implying that they converge to the population parameter in asymptotically large samples 2 4 4 instrument validity we verify that rainfall satisfies the three assumptions for a valid instrument and claim that it is relevant exogeneous and excluded hernán and robins 2020 specifically we verify that 1 there is a true association between rainfall and water fetching relevance 2 rainfall is not associated with confounders of the fetching time test score relationship exogeneity and 3 the effect of the rainfall on the test scores is exclusively mediated by fetching time exclusion details of assumption validity diagnostic tests and supporting literature are available in table a 9 and the appendix methods while we are interested in the direct effect of children s water collection time on their own schooling we recognize that there may be additional mechanisms tied to other household members fetching responsibilities that affect children s learning achievement we explore one of these potential mechanisms in section 3 5 2 4 5 econometric specification the econometric specification is of the form 2 t i t a b z i t c x i t v i t 3 y i t α β t i t γ x i t ε i t where z i t is the instrumental variable of freshwater availability and t i t is the predicted total daily fetching time of children in minutes the first stage model equation 2 estimates children s daily fetching time using z i t rainfall and x i t as predictors this step purges fetching time of its correlation with the test score outcomes our second stage equation 3 estimates the effect on test score y i t with the predicted values of fetching time from the first stage t i t two stages of linear regressions estimated by ordinary least squares is the standard approach for instrumental variable analyses angrist and pischke 2008 we present these estimates as our main results with cluster robust standard errors at the village level as the ihds randomly selects households from each sampled village desai and vanneman 2018 when the two stages are manually and separately estimated we compute cluster bootstrapped standard errors all data cleaning and analysis is done in rstudio version 1 2 1335 rstudio team 2018 the two stage least squares models are estimated using the ivreg function in the aer package kleiber and zeileis 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary statistics table 1 provides an overview of the households surveyed by the ihds all children who were tested are included in the calculation of the descriptive statistics the variables shown are used as controls in our analyses given that most of the same households were surveyed twice the descriptive statistics are similar across rounds except for household expenditure per capita which increases from an average 715 to 1599 rupees nearly one half of the sample is girls the mean age is young approximately 9 5 years and the mean education is low approximately 7 years approximately 70 percent of households are located in rural areas and approximately 35 to 40 percent of households belong to dalit or muslim communities the water delivery mechanisms across india are heterogeneous with various non networked water supplies collectively accounting for 60 to 70 percent of households usual supplies the rest of the households rely on piped water approximately 38 percent table a 2 for the distribution across all ihds water infrastructure types among children who fetch water hand pumps are the most common across sex and social strata piped water is most common among urban children who fetch table a 3 table 2 displays the test scores for children aged eight through eleven comparing the second round to the first in general students reading and mathematical skills are slightly lower and their writing skills are higher for the mathematics test the more advanced skills such as division declined the most approximately 23 0 to 17 6 percent of students achieving the highest score of three while the ability to identify a number improved across rounds 32 2 to 36 5 percent more students are non readers in the second round 9 5 to 11 4 percent the signatures of social stratification and income inequities are evident in the score distributions sex differences are less evident figures a 1 1 a 1 3 most children self reported that they were attending school at the times of the surveys table a 4 table 3 shows children s average daily fetching times across the different categories of social inequities in general fetching times are lower in 2011 2012 than in 2004 2005 however across the two rounds the percentage of children fetching water increased for all subgroups across all years on average girls have higher fetching times than boys 13 minute and 6 minute differences in the means across sex for 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 respectively children from most socially advantaged groups brahmins sikhs jains christians have the lowest average fetching times approximately 31 and 28 minutes for 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 respectively the average fetching time is higher for children in rural households approximately 57 and 35 minutes in 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 respectively than for children in urban households approximately 43 and 32 minutes in 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 respectively comparing across income quartiles the proportion of children fetching shows evidence of a trend the highest income quartile has the fewest children fetching e g in 2004 2005 approximately 9 percent versus 25 percent for the lowest quartile similarly the proportion of children collecting water differs across infrastructure types with households using piped water having the smallest proportion of children fetching e g in 2011 2012 approximately 16 percent versus 40 percent for households collecting from hand pumps among the 10 to 16 percent of children who fetch from piped sources over 90 percent have access to off premises taps in both rounds table a 5 children with on premises access may still fetch water if for example the tap is located on a distant part of the compound and or is shared by several households and requires waiting given that the majority of children do not fetch water and have on premises piped water table a 5 references to piped water throughout the paper mainly refer to on premises piped we label it as mostly on premises or monp for clarity however given the prevalence of off premises water among children who fetch from piped water sources our discussions on the effects of fetching time on learning achievement refer to mostly off premises piped water which is denoted as mofp regardless of the location of the piped source from which children fetch our rainfall instrument remains relevant given that in india piped water is often supplied by rainfall fed reservoirs srinivasan et al 2013 or rainfall recharged groundwater reddy 2010 table a 6 provides more information on fetching times by state with a few exceptions the percentage of children who fetch water is less than 30 percent however for all states there is high variation within states and between years reflective of the high temporal and spatial variability in freshwater availability figure 1 3 2 the relationship between fetching time and learning achievement to ground the findings from our preferred more complex instrumental variable model we compare them with the evidence from the simpler naïve model figure 2 we present all results in terms of one hour changes in fetching time as opposed to one minute changes given the orders of magnitude in table 3 broadly the naive model results top panel suggest that controlling for all else in the model there is statistical evidence that increasing children s water collection time decreases their mathematical and reading skills the effect on writing is negative but insignificant table a 7 these model estimates are downward biased biased toward the null which may be attributed to omitted variable bias in the ols estimator beegle et al 2009 our instrumental variable model figure 2 bottom panel exhibits a similar story in terms of the relative magnitudes of the associations tables a 8 and a 9 specifically all else equal for a one hour increase in fetching time children s average mathematics test score decreases by approximately 1 23 points on a three point scale equivalent to approximately 1 3 standard deviations for every additional hour of fetching time the average reading score decreases in a statistically significant way by approximately 1 53 points on a four point scale equivalent to approximately 1 1 standard deviations the average writing score also declines significantly by approximately 0 87 points for a one hour increase in water fetching time on a one point scale equivalent to approximately 1 9 standard deviations 2 5 heterogeneity across subgroups and water source to strengthen the policy relevance of our research we identify the conditional average effects of changes in daily fetching time on learning achievement among different subpopulations of children we study effect heterogeneity across income community caste religion and sex by building regression models with interaction terms between these categories and our fetching time variable table 4 presents the heterogeneity analysis results at the 95 percent confidence level the only significant results are across sex boys mathematics and readings scores are less affected than girls by approximately 0 26 and 0 27 points respectively for one hour reductions in fetching time the lack of statistical significance across communities and income quartiles does not imply that there are no real substantive differences in the effects of changes in water collection time on test scores rather in our data set and with our methods we are unable to confidently say that these differences are statistically different from zero we offer two potential explanations for these findings first unlike for caste different sexes can more readily be found living in the same households or communities thus in our heterogeneity analyses we are more easily able to isolate the effect across sex than across caste second any household level gender inequities such as son preference vary widely by state mutharayappa et al 1997 while caste divisions are pervasive and rigid zacharias and vakulabharanam 2011 and nearly impossible to eliminate statistically our results suggest that beyond the average benefit that better water access affords to all students if indian girls are given more time they can accomplish more academically than boys the disproportionate effect across sex may be a consequence of fetching time being more relevant to girls than boys existing evidence suggests and our data support table 3 the claim that among children who fetch there are more girls than boys coon 2016 o reilly 2006 furthermore this gendered effect on girls education is not unique to water infrastructure previous research has found that indian girls can profit educationally more than boys from investments in other basic infrastructure for example improving access to electricity in rural india has been shown to increase enrolment study time and attainment among all children aged seven to fifteen with girls benefiting more than boys khandker 2012 though biofuel collection among girls is less common than water collection world bank 2002 the link between improved energy infrastructure and education can still be understood in terms of tradeoffs just as with water so better access to electricity can reduce the labor intensity of girls household responsibilities and enable them to spend more time attending school and or studying khandker 2012 in addition in a study by orgill meyer and pattanayak 2020 on sanitation in rural india relative to girls belonging to villages with no latrines girls with universal latrine coverage in early childhood had significantly higher scores on a cognitive skills test administered ten years later this effect was larger among girls than boys our results provide insight into the type of water infrastructure that should be constructed to promote children s academic success the mathematics and writing scores of children who collect water from hand pumps open wells and tube wells are more affected by increases in fetching time than those of children who have access to mofp piped water figure 3 specifically their mathematics scores are approximately 0 27 to 0 35 points more affected and their writing scores approximately 0 14 to 0 18 points more affected by water collection compared to the scores of children in households with mofp piped water access these results may be due to the fact that most children with piped access spend little to no time collecting water 85 to 90 percent of children with piped water do not fetch see table a 5 this result may also be explained by differences in physical exertion required to operate each type of infrastructure unlike pressurized piped water hand pumps and open wells are manually operated and therefore more labor intensive repeated laborious tasks may exhaust or injure children degrading the quality e g inability to focus and or quantity e g need more rest of their study time in addition children accessing any off premise sources may be injured from assault and or dangerous terrain venkataramanan et al 2020 risks that likely heighten the more time children spend collecting water it is important to consider these potential costs and risks given that among those children who fetch water in our dataset the majority uses hand pumps 3 4 climate related water insecurity across several regions of india in nearly two thirds of the districts unicef 2017 climate change is heightening water insecurity goyal and surampalli 2018 in recent decades over the span of the ihds surveys the country has experienced devasting climate extremes goyal and surampalli 2018 we find evidence of the consequences of climate related water insecurity in our dataset for all subgroups examined in our analyses the percentage of children fetching water increased across survey rounds table 3 poor rural and scheduled tribes adivasis subpopulations experienced the largest increases in addition average mathematics and reading scores decreased slightly for most subgroups across rounds figures a 1 1 a 1 3 since these surveys water insecurity in india has been linked to worse educational outcomes in 2016 severe drought across ten states was associated with a 22 percent increase in number of children dropping out of school to help with water collection coon 2016 goyal and surampalli 2018 our results are becoming increasingly relevant for more of india s children in recent years the indian government has focused on providing on premises piped water to all rural households to meet the heightened water needs associated with increased toilet coverage facilitated by the swachh bharat mission satyavada 2019 since 2019 through the jal jeevan mission the number of households with functioning piped tap connections increased from approximately 17 to 41 percent government of india goi 2021 remarkably bihar one of the poorest states in india world bank 2017 experienced an increase in coverage from 2 to 86 percent of households this progress was likely aided by bihar s relatively high freshwater availability goyal and surampalli 2018 world business council for sustainable development wbcsd 2019 which may indicate that other states in east and northeast india with similar resources could support reliable piped on premises infrastructure in contrast coverage in the wealthy state of tamil nadu world bank 2017 improved from 17 to 34 percent this slower progress may have been hindered by recent drought conditions chennai water crisis 2019 and ensuing freshwater deficits in south as well as northwest india with existing and increasing water insecurity concerns goyal and surampalli 2018 shared village level off premises supplies may be more sustainable than universal household level connections for off premises water supplies based on our findings we recommend the construction of piped taps as opposed to other types of infrastructure such as hand pumps or open wells off premises piped networks have the added benefit of being infrastructure necessary to the jal jeevan mission if new supplies are discovered in water insecure states and or management techniques developed then households could be more readily linked to existing distribution systems to promote equitable access to water and education construction should be prioritized in low income rural areas that indicate gender inequity in education in our dataset among several of the lowest income states world bank 2017 we find evidence of a co occurrence between hand pump use and high gender gaps in learning achievement across all subjects notably in uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh both states have less on premises coverage than tamil nadu while improvements to off premises piped supplies may be more pressing in madhya pradesh due to its current low freshwater availability world business council for sustainable development wbcsd 2019 further research on hydrological and climate modeling as well as measurements of household based water insecurity young et al 2019 may aid in deciding targeting strategies sufficient planning will be needed to ensure that existing issues such as groundwater source depletion das et al 2019 reddy 2010 and piped water supply intermittency coon 2016 kumpel and nelson 2013 do not rapidly engender defunct piped systems with unpredictable water delivery that will counter productively demand more time spent on collection 3 5 extension mechanism through caregivers fetching time this paper has assessed at length the immediate tradeoff that children themselves make between fetching water and their education we now consider a different mechanism via caregivers water collection responsibilities by which fetching time might affect children s education i e same exclusion restriction criterion different theoretical underpinnings children whose caregivers fetch water may be required to complete tasks instead of schoolwork that these adults would have otherwise performed or children may lack supervision during their studies at home if their caregivers must allocate that time to water collection or other domestic responsibilities essential to family survival we explore these types of tradeoffs performing our main two stage least squares model with men and women s fetching times as the second stage outcomes for those adults living in the same households as the children who were tested the results suggest that one hour reductions in women and men s fetching times are associated with improvements in children s mathematics women 0 37 95ci 0 66 0 076 men 0 94 95ci 1 72 0 16 reading women 0 46 95ci 0 79 0 12 men 1 17 95ci 2 06 0 27 and writing women 0 26 95ci 0 38 0 14 men 0 66 95ci 1 02 0 30 abilities table a 10 similarly a recent study examined the implications of mothers water collection on their children s education and found that children aged six to fourteen whose mothers spent less time fetching water had higher predicted probabilities of being able to perform elementary arithmetic choudhuri and desai in press while our results are not directly comparable due to scaling differences our conclusions are the same the less time women spend fetching water the better the academic performance of the children in their household more importantly comparing our caregiver and main model results we find that children s fetching responsibilities may have larger educational ramifications than their caregivers which supports our main hypothesized mechanism through children s own fetching time 3 6 robustness to potential confounders or variables on the causal pathway our paper rests on the assumption that freshwater availability is primarily associated with learning achievement through children s fetching time a premise further supported by the preceding section however it is conceivable that there are variables which mediate this relationship variables that may exist on the hypothesized causal pathway linking rainfall to fetching time fetching time to effort and effort to educational performance one such variable is child labor we assume that the effect of child labor on learning achievement is primarily mediated through time not spent in school or not studying outside of school kookana et al 2016 we represent child labor and its mediation with variables measuring days absent from school over the past month reported for children by an adult survey respondent and days spent working on the farm over the past year reported for children by an adult survey respondent we also explore child health as a second potential confounder freshwater availability may be associated with learning achievement through food security a proximal determinant of children s nutritional status chakrabarti et al 2018 kishore and chakrabarti 2015 and distal factor associated with cognitive abilities nyaradi et al 2013 to capture this potential pathway we adjust for households diet diversity computed as the sum of the unique food groups consumed by the household in the month prior to the survey swindale and bilinksy 2006 we also control for child height absolute in centimeters a well researched proxy of child health prendergast and humphrey 2014 on performing our main model with these additional covariates we find that the primary effects of fetching time on learning achievement hold the point estimates and confidence intervals remain similar to those of the main econometric specification in figure 2 furthermore the effects of diet days absent and days farming are insignificant the relationship between height and learning achievement is significant but relatively small compared to that between fetching time and achievement table a 11 these results support the exclusion restriction and allay concerns of confounding due to child labor or child health on our assumed pathways 3 7 robustness to test score measurement our main models treated the test scores as interval scales assuming that the observable test performances were generated by unobservable normal latent abilities captured by the scores hambleton and cook 1977 however we also acknowledge the long standing concerns and complexities surrounding the treatment of ordinal scales as interval scales bond and lang 2013 we address the ordinality of the test scores and explore the implications of our interval scale assumption by estimating linear probability models for which the dependent variables are dummy variables equal to one if the child has achieved at least a certain level of mastery in mathematics reading or writing chakraborty and jayaraman 2019 spears 2012 the results in table a 12 confirm our main findings that decreased fetching time is associated with improvements in mathematics reading and writing skills for example we find that the probability that children achieve at least the basic mathematical skill of number recognition or subtraction decreases by approximately 0 53 and 0 82 points respectively for a one hour increase in predicted fetching time there may not be improvement in the mastery of subtraction division or paragraph reading with decreases in fetching time per the lack of statistical significance at the 95 percent confidence level while we do not perform our heterogeneity analyses using linear probability models we acknowledge that comparisons across groups e g sex caste religion or income may be sensitive to the choice of scale bond and lang 2013 despite the robustness of our main conclusions and the confidence this check lends we recommend careful interpretation of the heterogeneity results table 4 3 8 sensitivity to assumptions about the data generating process for our main models the first and second stages were linear regressions estimated using ordinary least squares as previously mentioned this approach is standard for two stage least squares angrist and pischke 2008 however there are limitations to this approach namely that using linear regression in the first stage not only allows for predicted fetching times to be negative but also may not adequately handle the preponderance of zero fetching times in the sample recall that fewer than 30 percent of children fetch across either survey per table a 5 to address these limitations we re estimate our main models using heckit tobit and tweedie models as the first stages we present detailed methods and findings see table a 13 and its legend in the appendix including a figure figure a 2 comparing the predictive fits across all models broadly speaking we find that the three different models yield similar conclusions to our main results in terms of direction and significance of the relationship between children s fetching time and their learning achievement across all subjects the effect sizes across the three models are smaller than those from our main model e g for the tobit model a one hour reduction in fetching time is associated with a decrease of 0 080 standard deviations in the average mathematics test score which is to be expected models designed to account for zeros should have less variation to model relative to common response distribution models while we report the results from the standard linear two stage least squares approach as our main findings we consider the results from these alternate specification as lower bound estimates 3 9 strengths and limitations this paper has several strengths first we evaluate the relationship between fetching time and learning achievement using an instrumental variable approach that supports causal inferences second we employ a large nationally representative dataset which lends confidence and broad relevance to our estimates third we answer novel questions about learning achievement to contribute to the limited evidence base on the social implications of poor water access however this paper is not without limitations first while the data follow the same households over time different children are measured in the first and second waves thus the data are not panel but rather longitudinal since we are unable to follow the same children over time we cannot assess the cumulative effects of water access conditions on learning achievement second fetching times of all household members are reported by mothers rather than measured in situ by an ihds enumerator which indicates the possibility for recall bias buor 2004 however using instrumental variable analysis with a large sample size addresses this problem given that rainfall as an objectively measured quantity is prone to less measurement error angrist and krueger 2001 third while we use the standard two stage least squares approach for our main models which is designed to produce first stage residuals that are uncorrelated with fitted values and covariates angrist and pischke 2008 an important feature for establishing plausible causality we also encounter a lack of fit due to the disproportionately large frequency of fetching times equal to zero to better address the semi continuous nature of the data we re estimate our models using three alternate first stages however the lack of literature limits the authors ability to identify potential implications of these non standard two stage least squares modeling decisions notwithstanding the findings are consistent with the conclusions from our main model which lends confidence to our paper s claims 4 conclusions with data on primary school children s education and water access in india this study uses two stage least squares estimation to establish for the first time a plausibly causal link between children s water collection responsibilities and their learning achievement the major implications of this study are threefold 1 we offer water sector professionals a rigorous statistical approach for estimating the social impact of infrastructural services 2 we enhance the policy relevance of our work by quantifying the heterogeneous effects of improvements in water access across sex caste and income in this way we identify avenues for targeting subpopulations with policies that promote equitable access to drinking water and education 3 we provide evidence for informing domestic water infrastructure construction priorities by demonstrating how various water infrastructure types affect education differently we discuss our findings in light of the government s current water infrastructure agenda and the growing

16712,in low and middle income countries the provisioning of safe drinking water is a challenge that will likely worsen with climate change securing water will require more work and time burdening women and children the most currently the consequences of this time burden to children s development remain understudied to address this gap we examine the tradeoff between children s household water collection responsibilities and learning achievement using nationally representative data from india we measure the effect of daily fetching time on primary school children s learning achievement in a two stage regression model with rainfall as the instrument our analyses indicate that higher fetching times predict lower mathematics 1 23 standard deviations 95ci 2 32 0 14 reading 1 13 standard

absence of piped to premises water in water insecure contexts and offer guidance for targeting infrastructure investments in india graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water infrastructure instrumental variable analysis domestic water policy climate related water security human capital development 1 introduction water is foundational for health and development and its deprivation prevents the realization of a range of human needs and rights currently in low and middle income settings over 780 million people lack access to safe drinking water world health organization 2019 as water insecurity worsens due to climate change young et al 2019 securing water will require more work and time while the health effects of poor access to water on childhood illness and mortality gera et al 2018 pickering and davis 2012 ravallion and jalan 1999 are well documented the broader social implications of the time burden of collection are comparatively understudied boone et al 2011 given that women and children particularly young girls are often responsible for water collection graham et al 2016 this time burden may be costly for children s development the time burden of water fetching can be understood in terms of tradeoffs often referred to as time poverty this burden is one of competing claims on individuals time that reduce their ability to make unconstrained choices on how they allocate their time wodon and blackden 2006 p 16 while no choice is completely unconstrained phelan and link 2013 this definition is helpful as it highlights the finite nature of time in the short term with each day limited to twenty four hours individuals must decide between daily activities for many children this tradeoff is between school market work and household chores such as water collection their levels of engagement across these categories are determined by other household members tradeoffs wodon and blackden 2006 both of which are products of sociocultural conditions surrounding the division of labor and importance of education among other norms coon 2016 masuda and cook 2013 depending on these norms and households resources displacing children s education may be necessary for families to meet basic needs in households facing severe time constraints children may drop out of school khanam and ross 2011 wodon and blackden 2006 in households that are less time poor children may not regularly attend school or may be expected to work rather than study outside of school hours akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 in either situation improving households access to basic infrastructure services especially water infrastructure may help promote children s education by reducing the time burden of domestic labor and lessening the necessity of tradeoffs with schooling koolwal and van de walle 2013 as with all child labor children s involvement in water collection can prejudice their participation in school akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 beegle et al 2009 lancaster and ray 2004 ray and lancaster 2005 nankhuni and findeis 2004 illustrate this tradeoff clearly among urban and rural households in malawi they found the more hours children aged six to fourteen dedicated to fetching water the less likely they were to attend school with a lower likelihood for those with piped water access similarly haile and haile 2012 showed that among rural ethiopian children aged seven to fifteen girls were more likely to fetch water than boys and increasing the distance to a water source a proxy for collection time reduced the likelihood of attending school it is worth noting that these two studies represent the smaller body of research that focuses on children s school participation and their own water collection as opposed to other household members water collection responsibilities e g ilahi 2001 koolwal and van de walle 2013 nauges and strand 2013 children s water collection responsibilities may also limit academic performance though there is comparatively less evidence to support this link the general consensus is that child labor in and outside of the household can adversely affect learning outcomes albeit the latter is considered more harmful to children s development beegle et al 2009 canagarajah and coulombe 1999 khanam and ross 2011 ravallion and wodon 1999 sanchez et al 2005 illustratively a study in ghana showed that work outside of the household was statistically significantly associated with learning achievement in reading and mathematics among children aged nine to eighteen e g associated with a ten percent reduction in an elementary mathematics test score the significance of the effect of work at home was unclear heady 2003 in a unique study focusing on children s water collection work and academic abilities among tanzanian households the authors akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 examined distance to water source as a determinant of time allocation for which they estimated the effect on reading and mathematical skills on finding evidence of a relationship between distance to water source and number of hours worked they discovered that children aged seven to fourteen worked more if the water sources were farther away which in turn was negatively related to the development of girls reading skills and boys mathematical skills akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 to our knowledge there are no other studies analyzing the effect of children s water collection on learning achievement and the akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 study has several limitations first it likely underestimated the relationship between time and learning achievement given that distance to source is only a proxy for the total time burden second the reading and mathematical ability measures were vaguely defined and based on parental judgement rather than test scores heady 2003 third the analysis examined the correlation rather than a plausibly causal relationship between water access and learning a more complete and conclusive assessment of the total burden to children s learning achievement remains to be done our paper addresses this gap by estimating the effect of decreasing the time burden of primary school children s water collection on their learning achievement using nationally representative data from india our study complements the accumulating literature examining the relationship between water and sanitation and children s cognition cameron et al 2021 choudhuri and desai in press dearden et al 2017 orgill meyer and pattanayak 2020 spears and lamba 2016 by using rigorous methods that support casual inference angrist and krueger 2001 boozer and suri 2001 maccini and yang 2009 shah and steinberg 2017 and by exploring heterogeneity in the effect of water fetching time on learning achievement across sex community caste religion economic status and water infrastructure we discuss our results and their policy relevance in light of climate related water security issues and government water priorities in india unicef 2017 2 methods 2 1 data our primary data source is the nationally representative india human development survey ihds this multi topic panel survey is organized by the university of maryland and the national council of applied economic research new delhi and was administered in 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 the survey instruments were translated into thirteen different indian languages for each round two one hour interviews were administered by local interviewers and were completed for approximately 42 000 households in 384 districts most of the same households were surveyed in both rounds children in these households aged eight through eleven completed short mathematics reading and writing tests given the seven to eight year gap between survey rounds these test scores are not panel data but instead represent the national learning achievement for students during those years in addition we use ihds measures of social and economic conditions to control for household characteristics such as education income and caste religion desai and vanneman 2018a b unfortunately data on freshwater availability in india are limited at the appropriate level of granularity and over the 2004 2012 span of interest we employ the highest resolution available monthly rainfall data in centimeters at the district level for the years 1989 2014 from the india meteorological department india meteorological department 2018 2 2 outcomes our three primary outcomes of interest are the mathematics reading and writing test scores chakraborty and jayaraman 2019 collected by the ihds for all children aged eight through eleven the tests were modeled closely after the annual status of education report aser survey cognitive tests spears and lamba 2016 the mathematics test is scored from zero to three with the levels representing the inability to do mathematics 0 and the abilities to recognize a number 1 to subtract 2 and to divide 3 the reading test is scored from zero to four with the levels representing the inability to read 0 and the abilities to read a letter 1 to read a word 2 to read a paragraph 3 and to read a story 4 the writing test is scored from zero to one with the levels representing the inability to write 0 and the ability to write with two or fewer mistakes 1 originally the ihds scored the writing test from zero to two in the 2011 2012 survey with an extra level for writing with no mistakes 1 prior to analysis we recode this variable to be binary to match the 2004 2005 survey with the writing with no mistakes level being accounted for in the writing with two or fewer mistakes level while these three tests only take integer values as scores it is reasonable to assume that the observable test performances are underlain by unobservable normal latent abilities hambleton and cook 1977 2 3 exposures our primary exposures of interest are child fetching time and freshwater availability in our data set children s fetching times are reported by their mothers as the total time daily spent collecting water by boys and or girls aged eight through eleven in the season during which the survey was completed this time includes traveling collecting and waiting in line at sources such as open wells hand pumps or tube wells freshwater availability is measured as the district level two year mean rainfall in centimeters years 2004 2005 inclusive for households in the first round and years 2010 2011 inclusive for households in the second round by constructing a two year annual mean we capture the previous year s precipitation which is an important determinant of the subsequent year s freshwater availability bhanja et al 2019 2 4 empirical framework 2 4 1 covariates we control for individual and household level covariates at the individual level we adjust for the age in years and sex dummy variable for male or female of the test taking child at the household level we include the usual drinking water source categorical variable and its location dummy variable for on or off premises table a 1 for relevant survey questions we also construct the leave out cluster mean of the location variable mean for household h over all households in a village other than h to represent village level access to water which may influence household level availability glick et al 2004 ilahi and grimard 2000 we also adjust for household monthly consumption per capita in rupees sum of monthly expenditures incurred by the household divided by the number of persons living in the household highest level of adult education in years residence location dummy variable for urban or rural and community caste religion categorical variable while there is no universally acknowledged caste hierarchy gupta 2000 based on previous literature we define the scheduled castes dalits scheduled tribes adivasis and muslims as the most underprivileged castes and religious groups and forward castes and brahmins as being among the most privileged we accord other backward castes the official term for disadvantaged castes other than scheduled castes in india a status in between zacharias and vakulabharanam 2011 2 4 2 base specification naïve model the base specification or naïve model is of the form separately for each of the three tests for child i at time t 1 y i t α β t i t γ x i t ε i t where y i t is the test score of interest mathematics reading or writing t i t is the child s total daily fetching time in minutes and x i t is a vector of individual level and household level covariates as well as time month and year of survey and district fixed effects with month dummies we adjust for seasonality and with a year dummy we control for national level trends in the outcomes with district fixed effects we account for all time invariant unobserved factors operating at the district level and force identification of within district coefficients the naïve model uses ordinary least squares estimation and serves as a point of reference for the instrumental variable model beegle et al 2009 2 4 3 instrumental variable model estimates from the naïve model are likely to be biased by omitted variables that are associated with test scores and fetching times angrist and krueger 2001 for example children in higher income households tend to work less akabayashi and psacharopoulos 1999 and live in contexts of better service delivery reddy 2010 however such latent characteristics are unmeasured and difficult to adjust for in a regression model with data at two time points the conventional approach for dealing with confounding in social experiments is to randomly assign the exposure of interest to a treatment group random assignment ensures that omitted variables are not associated with the exposure and outcome our use of freshwater availability precipitation is a quasi random process solves the omitted variables problem by using variation in fetching times that is not associated with omitted variables in other words to make plausibly causal inferences about the relationship between learning achievement and water fetching time we employ the instrumental variable two stage least squares estimation method pickering and davis 2012 to parse out the relationship that is independent of their endogeneity to other variables polsky and basu 2012 wooldridge 2013 pp 512 530 particularly household and institutional characteristics instrumental variables ensure that parameter estimates are consistent implying that they converge to the population parameter in asymptotically large samples 2 4 4 instrument validity we verify that rainfall satisfies the three assumptions for a valid instrument and claim that it is relevant exogeneous and excluded hernán and robins 2020 specifically we verify that 1 there is a true association between rainfall and water fetching relevance 2 rainfall is not associated with confounders of the fetching time test score relationship exogeneity and 3 the effect of the rainfall on the test scores is exclusively mediated by fetching time exclusion details of assumption validity diagnostic tests and supporting literature are available in table a 9 and the appendix methods while we are interested in the direct effect of children s water collection time on their own schooling we recognize that there may be additional mechanisms tied to other household members fetching responsibilities that affect children s learning achievement we explore one of these potential mechanisms in section 3 5 2 4 5 econometric specification the econometric specification is of the form 2 t i t a b z i t c x i t v i t 3 y i t α β t i t γ x i t ε i t where z i t is the instrumental variable of freshwater availability and t i t is the predicted total daily fetching time of children in minutes the first stage model equation 2 estimates children s daily fetching time using z i t rainfall and x i t as predictors this step purges fetching time of its correlation with the test score outcomes our second stage equation 3 estimates the effect on test score y i t with the predicted values of fetching time from the first stage t i t two stages of linear regressions estimated by ordinary least squares is the standard approach for instrumental variable analyses angrist and pischke 2008 we present these estimates as our main results with cluster robust standard errors at the village level as the ihds randomly selects households from each sampled village desai and vanneman 2018 when the two stages are manually and separately estimated we compute cluster bootstrapped standard errors all data cleaning and analysis is done in rstudio version 1 2 1335 rstudio team 2018 the two stage least squares models are estimated using the ivreg function in the aer package kleiber and zeileis 2020 3 results and discussion 3 1 summary statistics table 1 provides an overview of the households surveyed by the ihds all children who were tested are included in the calculation of the descriptive statistics the variables shown are used as controls in our analyses given that most of the same households were surveyed twice the descriptive statistics are similar across rounds except for household expenditure per capita which increases from an average 715 to 1599 rupees nearly one half of the sample is girls the mean age is young approximately 9 5 years and the mean education is low approximately 7 years approximately 70 percent of households are located in rural areas and approximately 35 to 40 percent of households belong to dalit or muslim communities the water delivery mechanisms across india are heterogeneous with various non networked water supplies collectively accounting for 60 to 70 percent of households usual supplies the rest of the households rely on piped water approximately 38 percent table a 2 for the distribution across all ihds water infrastructure types among children who fetch water hand pumps are the most common across sex and social strata piped water is most common among urban children who fetch table a 3 table 2 displays the test scores for children aged eight through eleven comparing the second round to the first in general students reading and mathematical skills are slightly lower and their writing skills are higher for the mathematics test the more advanced skills such as division declined the most approximately 23 0 to 17 6 percent of students achieving the highest score of three while the ability to identify a number improved across rounds 32 2 to 36 5 percent more students are non readers in the second round 9 5 to 11 4 percent the signatures of social stratification and income inequities are evident in the score distributions sex differences are less evident figures a 1 1 a 1 3 most children self reported that they were attending school at the times of the surveys table a 4 table 3 shows children s average daily fetching times across the different categories of social inequities in general fetching times are lower in 2011 2012 than in 2004 2005 however across the two rounds the percentage of children fetching water increased for all subgroups across all years on average girls have higher fetching times than boys 13 minute and 6 minute differences in the means across sex for 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 respectively children from most socially advantaged groups brahmins sikhs jains christians have the lowest average fetching times approximately 31 and 28 minutes for 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 respectively the average fetching time is higher for children in rural households approximately 57 and 35 minutes in 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 respectively than for children in urban households approximately 43 and 32 minutes in 2004 2005 and 2011 2012 respectively comparing across income quartiles the proportion of children fetching shows evidence of a trend the highest income quartile has the fewest children fetching e g in 2004 2005 approximately 9 percent versus 25 percent for the lowest quartile similarly the proportion of children collecting water differs across infrastructure types with households using piped water having the smallest proportion of children fetching e g in 2011 2012 approximately 16 percent versus 40 percent for households collecting from hand pumps among the 10 to 16 percent of children who fetch from piped sources over 90 percent have access to off premises taps in both rounds table a 5 children with on premises access may still fetch water if for example the tap is located on a distant part of the compound and or is shared by several households and requires waiting given that the majority of children do not fetch water and have on premises piped water table a 5 references to piped water throughout the paper mainly refer to on premises piped we label it as mostly on premises or monp for clarity however given the prevalence of off premises water among children who fetch from piped water sources our discussions on the effects of fetching time on learning achievement refer to mostly off premises piped water which is denoted as mofp regardless of the location of the piped source from which children fetch our rainfall instrument remains relevant given that in india piped water is often supplied by rainfall fed reservoirs srinivasan et al 2013 or rainfall recharged groundwater reddy 2010 table a 6 provides more information on fetching times by state with a few exceptions the percentage of children who fetch water is less than 30 percent however for all states there is high variation within states and between years reflective of the high temporal and spatial variability in freshwater availability figure 1 3 2 the relationship between fetching time and learning achievement to ground the findings from our preferred more complex instrumental variable model we compare them with the evidence from the simpler naïve model figure 2 we present all results in terms of one hour changes in fetching time as opposed to one minute changes given the orders of magnitude in table 3 broadly the naive model results top panel suggest that controlling for all else in the model there is statistical evidence that increasing children s water collection time decreases their mathematical and reading skills the effect on writing is negative but insignificant table a 7 these model estimates are downward biased biased toward the null which may be attributed to omitted variable bias in the ols estimator beegle et al 2009 our instrumental variable model figure 2 bottom panel exhibits a similar story in terms of the relative magnitudes of the associations tables a 8 and a 9 specifically all else equal for a one hour increase in fetching time children s average mathematics test score decreases by approximately 1 23 points on a three point scale equivalent to approximately 1 3 standard deviations for every additional hour of fetching time the average reading score decreases in a statistically significant way by approximately 1 53 points on a four point scale equivalent to approximately 1 1 standard deviations the average writing score also declines significantly by approximately 0 87 points for a one hour increase in water fetching time on a one point scale equivalent to approximately 1 9 standard deviations 2 5 heterogeneity across subgroups and water source to strengthen the policy relevance of our research we identify the conditional average effects of changes in daily fetching time on learning achievement among different subpopulations of children we study effect heterogeneity across income community caste religion and sex by building regression models with interaction terms between these categories and our fetching time variable table 4 presents the heterogeneity analysis results at the 95 percent confidence level the only significant results are across sex boys mathematics and readings scores are less affected than girls by approximately 0 26 and 0 27 points respectively for one hour reductions in fetching time the lack of statistical significance across communities and income quartiles does not imply that there are no real substantive differences in the effects of changes in water collection time on test scores rather in our data set and with our methods we are unable to confidently say that these differences are statistically different from zero we offer two potential explanations for these findings first unlike for caste different sexes can more readily be found living in the same households or communities thus in our heterogeneity analyses we are more easily able to isolate the effect across sex than across caste second any household level gender inequities such as son preference vary widely by state mutharayappa et al 1997 while caste divisions are pervasive and rigid zacharias and vakulabharanam 2011 and nearly impossible to eliminate statistically our results suggest that beyond the average benefit that better water access affords to all students if indian girls are given more time they can accomplish more academically than boys the disproportionate effect across sex may be a consequence of fetching time being more relevant to girls than boys existing evidence suggests and our data support table 3 the claim that among children who fetch there are more girls than boys coon 2016 o reilly 2006 furthermore this gendered effect on girls education is not unique to water infrastructure previous research has found that indian girls can profit educationally more than boys from investments in other basic infrastructure for example improving access to electricity in rural india has been shown to increase enrolment study time and attainment among all children aged seven to fifteen with girls benefiting more than boys khandker 2012 though biofuel collection among girls is less common than water collection world bank 2002 the link between improved energy infrastructure and education can still be understood in terms of tradeoffs just as with water so better access to electricity can reduce the labor intensity of girls household responsibilities and enable them to spend more time attending school and or studying khandker 2012 in addition in a study by orgill meyer and pattanayak 2020 on sanitation in rural india relative to girls belonging to villages with no latrines girls with universal latrine coverage in early childhood had significantly higher scores on a cognitive skills test administered ten years later this effect was larger among girls than boys our results provide insight into the type of water infrastructure that should be constructed to promote children s academic success the mathematics and writing scores of children who collect water from hand pumps open wells and tube wells are more affected by increases in fetching time than those of children who have access to mofp piped water figure 3 specifically their mathematics scores are approximately 0 27 to 0 35 points more affected and their writing scores approximately 0 14 to 0 18 points more affected by water collection compared to the scores of children in households with mofp piped water access these results may be due to the fact that most children with piped access spend little to no time collecting water 85 to 90 percent of children with piped water do not fetch see table a 5 this result may also be explained by differences in physical exertion required to operate each type of infrastructure unlike pressurized piped water hand pumps and open wells are manually operated and therefore more labor intensive repeated laborious tasks may exhaust or injure children degrading the quality e g inability to focus and or quantity e g need more rest of their study time in addition children accessing any off premise sources may be injured from assault and or dangerous terrain venkataramanan et al 2020 risks that likely heighten the more time children spend collecting water it is important to consider these potential costs and risks given that among those children who fetch water in our dataset the majority uses hand pumps 3 4 climate related water insecurity across several regions of india in nearly two thirds of the districts unicef 2017 climate change is heightening water insecurity goyal and surampalli 2018 in recent decades over the span of the ihds surveys the country has experienced devasting climate extremes goyal and surampalli 2018 we find evidence of the consequences of climate related water insecurity in our dataset for all subgroups examined in our analyses the percentage of children fetching water increased across survey rounds table 3 poor rural and scheduled tribes adivasis subpopulations experienced the largest increases in addition average mathematics and reading scores decreased slightly for most subgroups across rounds figures a 1 1 a 1 3 since these surveys water insecurity in india has been linked to worse educational outcomes in 2016 severe drought across ten states was associated with a 22 percent increase in number of children dropping out of school to help with water collection coon 2016 goyal and surampalli 2018 our results are becoming increasingly relevant for more of india s children in recent years the indian government has focused on providing on premises piped water to all rural households to meet the heightened water needs associated with increased toilet coverage facilitated by the swachh bharat mission satyavada 2019 since 2019 through the jal jeevan mission the number of households with functioning piped tap connections increased from approximately 17 to 41 percent government of india goi 2021 remarkably bihar one of the poorest states in india world bank 2017 experienced an increase in coverage from 2 to 86 percent of households this progress was likely aided by bihar s relatively high freshwater availability goyal and surampalli 2018 world business council for sustainable development wbcsd 2019 which may indicate that other states in east and northeast india with similar resources could support reliable piped on premises infrastructure in contrast coverage in the wealthy state of tamil nadu world bank 2017 improved from 17 to 34 percent this slower progress may have been hindered by recent drought conditions chennai water crisis 2019 and ensuing freshwater deficits in south as well as northwest india with existing and increasing water insecurity concerns goyal and surampalli 2018 shared village level off premises supplies may be more sustainable than universal household level connections for off premises water supplies based on our findings we recommend the construction of piped taps as opposed to other types of infrastructure such as hand pumps or open wells off premises piped networks have the added benefit of being infrastructure necessary to the jal jeevan mission if new supplies are discovered in water insecure states and or management techniques developed then households could be more readily linked to existing distribution systems to promote equitable access to water and education construction should be prioritized in low income rural areas that indicate gender inequity in education in our dataset among several of the lowest income states world bank 2017 we find evidence of a co occurrence between hand pump use and high gender gaps in learning achievement across all subjects notably in uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh both states have less on premises coverage than tamil nadu while improvements to off premises piped supplies may be more pressing in madhya pradesh due to its current low freshwater availability world business council for sustainable development wbcsd 2019 further research on hydrological and climate modeling as well as measurements of household based water insecurity young et al 2019 may aid in deciding targeting strategies sufficient planning will be needed to ensure that existing issues such as groundwater source depletion das et al 2019 reddy 2010 and piped water supply intermittency coon 2016 kumpel and nelson 2013 do not rapidly engender defunct piped systems with unpredictable water delivery that will counter productively demand more time spent on collection 3 5 extension mechanism through caregivers fetching time this paper has assessed at length the immediate tradeoff that children themselves make between fetching water and their education we now consider a different mechanism via caregivers water collection responsibilities by which fetching time might affect children s education i e same exclusion restriction criterion different theoretical underpinnings children whose caregivers fetch water may be required to complete tasks instead of schoolwork that these adults would have otherwise performed or children may lack supervision during their studies at home if their caregivers must allocate that time to water collection or other domestic responsibilities essential to family survival we explore these types of tradeoffs performing our main two stage least squares model with men and women s fetching times as the second stage outcomes for those adults living in the same households as the children who were tested the results suggest that one hour reductions in women and men s fetching times are associated with improvements in children s mathematics women 0 37 95ci 0 66 0 076 men 0 94 95ci 1 72 0 16 reading women 0 46 95ci 0 79 0 12 men 1 17 95ci 2 06 0 27 and writing women 0 26 95ci 0 38 0 14 men 0 66 95ci 1 02 0 30 abilities table a 10 similarly a recent study examined the implications of mothers water collection on their children s education and found that children aged six to fourteen whose mothers spent less time fetching water had higher predicted probabilities of being able to perform elementary arithmetic choudhuri and desai in press while our results are not directly comparable due to scaling differences our conclusions are the same the less time women spend fetching water the better the academic performance of the children in their household more importantly comparing our caregiver and main model results we find that children s fetching responsibilities may have larger educational ramifications than their caregivers which supports our main hypothesized mechanism through children s own fetching time 3 6 robustness to potential confounders or variables on the causal pathway our paper rests on the assumption that freshwater availability is primarily associated with learning achievement through children s fetching time a premise further supported by the preceding section however it is conceivable that there are variables which mediate this relationship variables that may exist on the hypothesized causal pathway linking rainfall to fetching time fetching time to effort and effort to educational performance one such variable is child labor we assume that the effect of child labor on learning achievement is primarily mediated through time not spent in school or not studying outside of school kookana et al 2016 we represent child labor and its mediation with variables measuring days absent from school over the past month reported for children by an adult survey respondent and days spent working on the farm over the past year reported for children by an adult survey respondent we also explore child health as a second potential confounder freshwater availability may be associated with learning achievement through food security a proximal determinant of children s nutritional status chakrabarti et al 2018 kishore and chakrabarti 2015 and distal factor associated with cognitive abilities nyaradi et al 2013 to capture this potential pathway we adjust for households diet diversity computed as the sum of the unique food groups consumed by the household in the month prior to the survey swindale and bilinksy 2006 we also control for child height absolute in centimeters a well researched proxy of child health prendergast and humphrey 2014 on performing our main model with these additional covariates we find that the primary effects of fetching time on learning achievement hold the point estimates and confidence intervals remain similar to those of the main econometric specification in figure 2 furthermore the effects of diet days absent and days farming are insignificant the relationship between height and learning achievement is significant but relatively small compared to that between fetching time and achievement table a 11 these results support the exclusion restriction and allay concerns of confounding due to child labor or child health on our assumed pathways 3 7 robustness to test score measurement our main models treated the test scores as interval scales assuming that the observable test performances were generated by unobservable normal latent abilities captured by the scores hambleton and cook 1977 however we also acknowledge the long standing concerns and complexities surrounding the treatment of ordinal scales as interval scales bond and lang 2013 we address the ordinality of the test scores and explore the implications of our interval scale assumption by estimating linear probability models for which the dependent variables are dummy variables equal to one if the child has achieved at least a certain level of mastery in mathematics reading or writing chakraborty and jayaraman 2019 spears 2012 the results in table a 12 confirm our main findings that decreased fetching time is associated with improvements in mathematics reading and writing skills for example we find that the probability that children achieve at least the basic mathematical skill of number recognition or subtraction decreases by approximately 0 53 and 0 82 points respectively for a one hour increase in predicted fetching time there may not be improvement in the mastery of subtraction division or paragraph reading with decreases in fetching time per the lack of statistical significance at the 95 percent confidence level while we do not perform our heterogeneity analyses using linear probability models we acknowledge that comparisons across groups e g sex caste religion or income may be sensitive to the choice of scale bond and lang 2013 despite the robustness of our main conclusions and the confidence this check lends we recommend careful interpretation of the heterogeneity results table 4 3 8 sensitivity to assumptions about the data generating process for our main models the first and second stages were linear regressions estimated using ordinary least squares as previously mentioned this approach is standard for two stage least squares angrist and pischke 2008 however there are limitations to this approach namely that using linear regression in the first stage not only allows for predicted fetching times to be negative but also may not adequately handle the preponderance of zero fetching times in the sample recall that fewer than 30 percent of children fetch across either survey per table a 5 to address these limitations we re estimate our main models using heckit tobit and tweedie models as the first stages we present detailed methods and findings see table a 13 and its legend in the appendix including a figure figure a 2 comparing the predictive fits across all models broadly speaking we find that the three different models yield similar conclusions to our main results in terms of direction and significance of the relationship between children s fetching time and their learning achievement across all subjects the effect sizes across the three models are smaller than those from our main model e g for the tobit model a one hour reduction in fetching time is associated with a decrease of 0 080 standard deviations in the average mathematics test score which is to be expected models designed to account for zeros should have less variation to model relative to common response distribution models while we report the results from the standard linear two stage least squares approach as our main findings we consider the results from these alternate specification as lower bound estimates 3 9 strengths and limitations this paper has several strengths first we evaluate the relationship between fetching time and learning achievement using an instrumental variable approach that supports causal inferences second we employ a large nationally representative dataset which lends confidence and broad relevance to our estimates third we answer novel questions about learning achievement to contribute to the limited evidence base on the social implications of poor water access however this paper is not without limitations first while the data follow the same households over time different children are measured in the first and second waves thus the data are not panel but rather longitudinal since we are unable to follow the same children over time we cannot assess the cumulative effects of water access conditions on learning achievement second fetching times of all household members are reported by mothers rather than measured in situ by an ihds enumerator which indicates the possibility for recall bias buor 2004 however using instrumental variable analysis with a large sample size addresses this problem given that rainfall as an objectively measured quantity is prone to less measurement error angrist and krueger 2001 third while we use the standard two stage least squares approach for our main models which is designed to produce first stage residuals that are uncorrelated with fitted values and covariates angrist and pischke 2008 an important feature for establishing plausible causality we also encounter a lack of fit due to the disproportionately large frequency of fetching times equal to zero to better address the semi continuous nature of the data we re estimate our models using three alternate first stages however the lack of literature limits the authors ability to identify potential implications of these non standard two stage least squares modeling decisions notwithstanding the findings are consistent with the conclusions from our main model which lends confidence to our paper s claims 4 conclusions with data on primary school children s education and water access in india this study uses two stage least squares estimation to establish for the first time a plausibly causal link between children s water collection responsibilities and their learning achievement the major implications of this study are threefold 1 we offer water sector professionals a rigorous statistical approach for estimating the social impact of infrastructural services 2 we enhance the policy relevance of our work by quantifying the heterogeneous effects of improvements in water access across sex caste and income in this way we identify avenues for targeting subpopulations with policies that promote equitable access to drinking water and education 3 we provide evidence for informing domestic water infrastructure construction priorities by demonstrating how various water infrastructure types affect education differently we discuss our findings in light of the government s current water infrastructure agenda and the growing

16713,dichloromethane dcm is a toxic industrial solvent frequently detected in multi contaminated aquifers it can be degraded biotically or abiotically and under oxic or anoxic conditions the extent and pathways of dcm degradation in aquifers may thus depend on water table fluctuations and microbial responses to hydrochemical variations here we examined the effect of water table fluctuations on dcm biodegradation in two laboratory aquifers fed with o2 depleted dcm spiked groundwater from a well characterized former industrial site hydrochemistry stable isotopes of dcm δ13c and δ37cl and bacterial community composition were examined to determine dcm mass removal and degradation pathways under steady state static water table and transient fluctuating water table conditions dcm mass

under transient conditions ε bulk c 11 8 2 0 and ε bulk cl 3 1 0 6 dual c cl isotope analysis suggested the prevalence of distinct anaerobic dcm degradation pathways with λc cl values of 1 92 0 30 and 3 58 0 42 under steady state and transient conditions respectively water table fluctuations caused changes in redox conditions and oxygen levels resulting in a higher relative abundance of desulfosporosinus peptococcaceae family taken together our results show that water table fluctuations enhanced dcm biodegradation and correlated with bacterial taxa associated with anaerobic dcm

groundwater was supplied from two sterile and gas tight 10 l glass reservoirs connected to each aquifer fig 1 each reservoir was kept under constant n2 flux and consisted of a mixture of groundwater and sterilized o2 depleted distilled water at a ratio of 1 3 this allowed to avoid clogging of the pipes feeding the aquifers due to mineral precipitation pure dcm was directly spiked and mixed into the reservoirs to reach aqueous concentrations of 0 47 mm l 1 equivalent to typical concentrations at contaminated sites hermon et al 2018 wright et al 2017 2 4 laboratory aquifer operations both aquifers were operated simultaneously prior to the experiments an incubation period of 70 days was established by operating both aquifers with a continuous flow of dcm spiked groundwater to reach

conditions hydrochemical variations are summarized in the si sections e and f overall saturated o2 concentrations 8 4 mg l 1 were observed in the unsaturated zone uz in both aquifers z 60 cm while o2 depleted levels were established in the saturated zone sz z 0 33 cm o2 1 0 mg l 1 the increase of redox potential over time eh ranged from 100 to 0 mv at days 0 and 35 respectively was consistent with o2 dynamics in the fluctuation zone z 17 33 cm si section f pronk et al 2020 concentrations of o2 rapidly increased up to 1 5 mg l 1 during drainage periods z 25 cm si section e during the first imbibition period water moved in an upward direction o2 concentrations decreased slightly but did not return to initial concentrations 1 3 mg l 1 from the second imbibition period until the end of the experiment o2 levels slowly decreased indicating that the system progressively returned to initial conditions o2 1 mg l 1 haberer et al 2012 re oxygenation of groundwater below the water table was likely associated with entrapped air serving as a source of o2 to the underlying o2 depleted water williams and oostrom 2000 redox potential and o2 varied upon water table fluctuation nevertheless the high concentration of fe2 in both aquifers up to 2 8 mg l 1 suggested prevailing reducing conditions in line with reducing conditions observed in situ for the groundwater used in this study hellal et al 2021 hermon et al 2018 si section f no other reduced species were detected in both aquifers d l cis dce and vc the two main chloroethenes in the groundwater source of this study hellal et al 2021 hermon et al 2018 were also followed to further examine the established hydrochemical conditions in the laboratory aquifers only cis dce was detected at the inflow of both aquifers with average concentrations of 15 mg l 1 and δ13cdce values of 23 5 0 4 si section g up to 90 of cis dce dissipated at the outflows after 35 days values of δ13c for cis dce were smaller δδ13cdce 2 at the outflows than δ13c values observed within the first 65 cm from inflow δδ13cdce 10 similarly vc concentrations of up to 6 and 12 mg l 1 were detected within the first 65 cm from inflow under steady state and transient conditions respectively and average δ13cvc values of 39 2 0 8 n 20 were formed along the flow path δ13cvc standard 29 5 0 2 si section g together with the detection of ohrb see below this suggests that reductive dechlorination occurred in both aquifers in agreement with observations at the groundwater source hellal et al 2021 hermon et al 2018 3 2 water table fluctuations affect dcm mass dissipation and c and cl isotope fractionation the absence of gas phase dcm gas phase q l 0 13 µg l 1 sampling volume 2 cm3 in the uz z 65 cm and headspace z 80 cm of both aquifers throughout the experiment and inlet outlet dcm mass balance indicated that volatilization did not contribute significantly 10 to the overall dcm dissipation in both aquifers steep concentration gradients are generally formed across the capillary fringe due to slow diffusion in water and small vertical dispersivity jeannottat and hunkeler 2013 previous studies showed that mass transport of pce and tce from the sz to the uz i e within the 15 cm above the water table led to 90 smaller gas phase concentrations with respect to the aqueous phase concentrations at the water table under steady state jeanottat and hunkeler 2013 mccarthy and johnson 1993 while variations of vocs concentrations in the gas phase increase in the uz when the water table drops as a result of residual water being in contact with the gas concentrations decrease again when the water table is raised returning to concentration equilibrium jeannottat and hunkeler 2013 mccarthy and johnson 1993 hence undetected gas phase dcm concentrations in the uz z 65 cm and headspace z 80 cm is likely due to i the low non dimensional henry s coefficient of dcm of 0 0549 at 18 c gossett 1987 non dimensional henry s coefficient of pce and tce of 0 495 and 0 265 respectively ii the continuous replenishment of the aqueous phase by horizontal groundwater flow and iii measurements carried out under near equilibrium conditions before and after each water table fluctuation event in the sz dcm concentrations decreased along the flow path in both aquifers after 35 days a more pronounced dcm mass dissipation in the aquifer outlets was observed under transient 95 than under steady state 42 conditions fig 2 δ13c and δ37cl values of dcm in the inflow water remained constant throughout the experiments 46 3 0 5 and 3 5 0 12 respectively under both transient and steady state conditions dcm became significantly enriched in both 13c and 37cl fig 2 c and cl isotope data for dcm degradation showed a good fit to the rayleigh model eq 1 under both hydraulic regimes r2 0 92 si section h apparent c and cl isotope fractionation values ε bulk c and ε bulk cl of 23 6 3 2 and 8 7 1 6 respectively were larger under steady state than under transient conditions ε bulk c and ε bulk cl values of 11 8 2 0 and 3 1 0 6 respectively si section h in previous reports dcm volatilization was associated with low c and cl fractionation εc 0 65 and εcl 0 48 compared to dcm biodegradation huang et al 1999 thus the magnitude of ε bulk c and ε bulk cl values under both hydraulic regimes suggest that dcm biodegradation prevailed in the aquifers the extent of dcm biodegradation b along the flow path was calculated based on reported εc values ranging from 71 to 15 5 and εcl values from 7 to 5 2 torgonskaya et al 2019 chen et al 2018 lee et al 2015 the range of εc and εcl values was defined based on the assumption that both aerobic and anaerobic dcm degradation pathways co occur in both aquifers which is supported by hydrochemical variations and micro oxic environments in the groundwater source hermon et al 2018 values of b under steady state and transient conditions ranged from 22 to 55 and from 22 to 90 respectively table 1 corresponding to the dcm mass dissipation observed under both hydraulic regimes time dependent first order biodegradation rate constants λt were calculated according to the rayleigh model as described in the si of hermon et al 2018 with values of 3 4 10 3 d 1 and 5 7 10 3 d 1 under steady state and transient conditions respectively worthy of note similar in situ λt were estimated at the groundwater source of this study hermon et al 2018 thus demonstrating the established near natural settings within the laboratory aquifers 3 3 dcm transformation pathways under transient and steady state conditions estimated λc cl values were lower under steady state 1 92 0 30 p 0 03 than under transient conditions 3 58 0 42 p 0 01 fig 3 this suggests distinct dcm c cl bond cleavage mechanisms under dynamic hydrogeological conditions the calculated λc cl values under transient conditions fall within the range of reported λc cl values during anaerobic dcm degradation 3 40 7 89 and are similar to λc cl values reported for ca dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis 3 40 0 03 chen et al 2018 which suggests the prevalence of anaerobic dcm pathways most strikingly the lower λc cl value determined under steady state conditions 1 92 0 30 has not been reported previously still this value likely also reflects anaerobic dcm degradation given that so far higher λc cl values 8 1 to 11 2 are rather associated with aerobic dcm degradation pathways heraty et al 1999 torgonskaya et al 2019 si section i to date anaerobic dcm degradation by bacteria affiliated with the peptococcaceae family has been examined using c cl csia two distinct anaerobic degradation pathways were reported for dcm fermentation by dehalobacterium formicoaceticum λc cl 7 89 0 12 and dcm mineralization by ca dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis λc cl 3 40 0 03 and proposed to be associated with the wood ljungdahl pathway wlp chen et al 2018 2020 kleindienst et al 2019 in addition blázquez pallí et al 2019 reported a distinct λc cl value 5 9 0 3 for anaerobic dcm degradation by a dehalobacterium containing culture differing from that associated with dehalobacterium formicoaceticum λc cl value 7 89 0 12 although the two strains belong to the same genus different characteristics of the bacterial cell envelope or enzyme locations may result in distinct c and cl isotope fractionation trueba santiso et al 2017 the differences in λc cl values under steady state and transient conditions may thus reflect distinct c cl bond cleavage reactions and distinct anaerobic dcm degradation pathways further our findings suggest that the prevalence of a given pathway depend on hydrochemical and hydrogeological dynamics in aquifers nevertheless both laboratory aquifers likely feature a variety of dcm degrading microorganisms with the possibility of simultaneous operations of several different aerobic and anaerobic degradation pathways van breukelen 2007 in particular the slight increase in o2 levels in the fluctuation zone under transient conditions may be indicative of micro oxic environments si sections e and f however the λc cl values obtained in our aquifers rather suggest the dominance of different anaerobic dcm degradation pathways which is further supported by the presence of taxa associated to anoxic conditions see below 3 4 water table fluctuations affect bacterial community composition and distribution of dcm associated taxa in total 3 649 087 high quality sequences were obtained from which 69 and 31 corresponded to pore water n 56 and sand samples n 24 respectively rarefaction curves of diversity indices reached asymptotes with increasing sequencing depth indicating sufficient sequencing efforts to capture the biodiversity extent of bacterial communities in both pore water and sand samples si section j changes in bacterial diversity were analyzed using nmds ordination of relative otu abundance diversity in sand samples day 88 varied mainly as a function of o2 gradients in the sz and uz fig 4b in contrast differences in bacterial diversity in pore water samples day 0 80 between inlet and outlet reservoirs suggested bacterial adaptation to dcm contamination along the flow path fig 4a nevertheless similar bacterial diversity under transient and steady state conditions for both pore water and sand samples suggested that water table fluctuations did not play a major role in shaping the overall composition of bacterial communities si sections k and l dominant taxa in aquifers may be associated with pollutants degradation pathways in both aquifers firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in sand samples with up to 60 of retrieved sequences at lower depths z 15 cm si section l previous studies have shown the presence of this phylum in aquifers highly contaminated with vocs hellal et al 2021 wright et al 2017 moreover firmicutes bacteria are known to utilize dcm as a sole carbon source under anoxic conditions kleindienst et al 2017 hence the occurrence of firmicutes supports the prevalence of anaerobic dcm biodegradation in both aquifers in pore water samples the dominant otu was associated with desulfosporosinus under both steady state and transient conditions fig 5 under steady state conditions desulfosporosinus and geobacter represented on average 25 and 12 of obtained sequences in the sz respectively while dehalobacterium and dehalococcoides represented each approximately 10 fig 5 under transient conditions in contrast desulfosporosinus increased from 25 to 58 relative abundance between days 0 and 13 in the sz z 15 cm corresponding to the first water table fluctuation event fig 5 geobacter was the second most abundant genus in the sz representing up to 15 followed by dehalobacterium 4 co occurrence of desulfosporosinus geobacter sulfurospirillum and dehalococcoides was reported previously in aquifers contaminated with halogenated contaminants hellal et al 2021 wright et al 2017 this parallel enrichment of different otus without demonstrated association with dcm degradation suggest interspecies interactions in our laboratory aquifers such interactions could be indicative of concomitant degradation of dcm and other halogenated contaminants as shown recently in investigations of other contaminated sites hellal et al 2021 trueba santiso et al 2020 blázquez pallí et al 2019 hermon et al 2018 wright et al 2017 detection of bacterial genera associated with ohr such as dehalococcoides further supports the concomitant degradation of dcm and cis dce in our laboratory aquifers furthermore reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes such as cis dce relies on h2 as electron donor distefano et al 1992 recently it was proposed that dcm mineralization by ca d elyunquensis produces h2 and co2 chen et al 2020 which may sustain reductive dechlorination in mixed contaminant plumes notably for growth with dcm ca d elyunquensis requires the presence of h2 consuming partner populations performing h2 co2 reductive acetogenesis while dehalobacterium formicoaceticum showed a strong dependence on co2 chen et al 2020 concomitant degradation of dcm and chlorinated ethenes in contaminated aquifers may thus result from interspecies metabolic networks associated with dehalogenative metabolism more generally dynamic environmental conditions such as water table fluctuations can increase microbial metabolic activity pronk et al 2020 thus we hypothesized that in the present study water table fluctuations promoted a larger enrichment of desulfosporosinus compared to steady state conditions fig 5 kleindienst et al 2019 reported that ca d elyunquensis expressed similar wlp associated enzymes as those of dehalobacter and desulfosporosinus spp hence the similar c and cl isotope fractionation determined here for dcm biodegradation under transient conditions λc cl 3 58 0 42 and by ca dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis λc cl 3 40 0 03 chen et al 2018 suggest that strains of the desulfosporosinus genus may be dcm degrading in line with a previous report wright et al 2017 in contrast the higher abundance of dehalobacterium under steady state conditions and similar c fractionation values to those of a dehalobacterium containing culture blázquez pallí et al 2019 suggest the occurrence of a fermentative dcm metabolism by as yet unknown dehalobacterium strains λc cl 1 92 0 30 worthy of note a recent study proposed ca formimonas warabiya strain dcmf as a novel dcm fermenting bacterium of the peptococcaceae family capable of metabolizing dcm to acetate via the wlp holland et al 2021 si section i clearly bacteria associated with the peptococcaceae family may play an important role in dcm biodegradation at contaminated sites 4 conclusions our study examined the effect of dynamic environmental conditions such as water table fluctuations on i hydrochemical conditions ii bacterial responses and in turn iii on dcm degradation pathways in multi contaminated aquifers our integrative approach combining c cl csia and biomolecular analyses suggested the prevalence of two distinct possibly co occurring anaerobic dcm degradation pathways under steady state and transient conditions bacterial diversity and distribution of dcm associated taxa was similar under both conditions however responses to water table fluctuations resulted in different bacterial community composition dominated by bacteria from the peptococcaceae family in particular desulfosporosinus sp we showed that environmental dynamics which are often excluded from laboratory degradation experiments can affect in situ dcm transformation while current knowledge of anaerobic transformation pathways of dcm limits interpretation of dcm in situ biodegradation fundamental research considering dynamics of environmental conditions are needed

16713,dichloromethane dcm is a toxic industrial solvent frequently detected in multi contaminated aquifers it can be degraded biotically or abiotically and under oxic or anoxic conditions the extent and pathways of dcm degradation in aquifers may thus depend on water table fluctuations and microbial responses to hydrochemical variations here we examined the effect of water table fluctuations on dcm biodegradation in two laboratory aquifers fed with o2 depleted dcm spiked groundwater from a well characterized former industrial site hydrochemistry stable isotopes of dcm δ13c and δ37cl and bacterial community composition were examined to determine dcm mass removal and degradation pathways under steady state static water table and transient fluctuating water table conditions dcm mass removal was more pronounced under transient 95 than under steady state conditions 42 c and cl isotopic fractionation values were larger under steady state ε bulk c 23 6 3 2 and ε bulk cl 8 7 1 6 than under transient conditions ε bulk c 11 8 2 0 and ε bulk cl 3 1 0 6 dual c cl isotope analysis suggested the prevalence of distinct anaerobic dcm degradation pathways with λc cl values of 1 92 0 30 and 3 58 0 42 under steady state and transient conditions respectively water table fluctuations caused changes in redox conditions and oxygen levels resulting in a higher relative abundance of desulfosporosinus peptococcaceae family taken together our results show that water table fluctuations enhanced dcm biodegradation and correlated with bacterial taxa associated with anaerobic dcm degradation our integrative approach allows to evaluate anaerobic dcm degradation under dynamic hydrogeological conditions and may help improving bioremediation strategies at dcm contaminated sites

probe in situ as it requires a high spatial and temporal monitoring resolution zhang and furman 2021 in this context laboratory aquifers under near natural settings may prove useful as flow fields can be controlled and mass fluxes can be established schürner et al 2016 the purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of water table fluctuations on hydrochemistry bacterial community

2021 hermon et al 2018 were set up to examine the reactive transport of dcm under transient i e induced water table fluctuations and steady state i e static water table conditions concentrations of chloroethenes cis dce and vc in the contaminated groundwater were also monitored the objectives of the present study were i to examine dcm dissipation processes in groundwater under steady state and transient conditions ii to infer dcm degradation pathways using dual c cl csia and iii to analyse bacterial community composition associated with dcm biodegradation by sequencing the 16s rrna gene 2

length height width and filled with sterile quartz sand grain size 0 4 0 6 mm depth 70 cm a headspace zone of 10 cm above the sand compartments was covered by a top glass mounted with 3 sampling ports

controlled room at 18 1 c both aquifers were continuously fed with o2 depleted contaminated groundwater o2 1 mg l 1 at a rate of 430 ml d 1 corresponding to an average water velocity of 0 02 m d 1 groundwater was supplied from two sterile and gas tight 10 l glass reservoirs connected to each aquifer fig 1 each reservoir was kept under constant n2 flux and consisted of a mixture of groundwater and sterilized o2 depleted distilled water at a ratio of 1 3 this allowed to avoid clogging of the pipes feeding the aquifers due to mineral precipitation pure dcm was directly spiked and mixed into the reservoirs to reach aqueous concentrations of 0 47 mm l 1 equivalent to typical concentrations at contaminated sites hermon et al 2018 wright et al 2017 2 4 laboratory aquifer operations both aquifers were operated simultaneously prior to the experiments an incubation period of 70 days was established by operating both aquifers with a continuous flow of dcm spiked groundwater to reach

was performed to visualize dissimilarities between bacterial taxa associated with dcm degradation hellal et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 water table fluctuations affect hydrochemical conditions hydrochemical variations are summarized in the si sections e and f overall saturated o2 concentrations 8 4 mg l 1 were observed in the unsaturated zone uz in both aquifers z 60 cm while o2 depleted levels were established in the saturated zone sz z 0 33 cm o2 1 0 mg l 1 the increase of redox potential over time eh ranged from 100 to 0 mv at days 0 and 35 respectively was consistent with o2 dynamics in the fluctuation zone z 17 33 cm si section f pronk et al 2020 concentrations of o2 rapidly increased up to 1 5 mg l 1 during drainage periods z 25 cm si section e during the first imbibition period water moved in an upward direction o2 concentrations decreased slightly but did not return to initial concentrations 1 3 mg l 1 from the second imbibition period until the end of the experiment o2 levels slowly decreased indicating that the system progressively returned to initial conditions o2 1 mg l 1 haberer et al 2012 re oxygenation of groundwater below the water table was likely associated with entrapped air serving as a source of o2 to the underlying o2 depleted water williams and oostrom 2000 redox potential and o2 varied upon water table fluctuation nevertheless the high concentration of fe2 in both aquifers up to 2 8 mg l 1 suggested prevailing reducing conditions in line with reducing conditions observed in situ for the groundwater used in this study hellal et al 2021 hermon et al 2018 si section f no other reduced species were detected in both aquifers d l cis dce and vc the two main chloroethenes in the groundwater source of this study hellal et al 2021 hermon et al 2018 were also followed to further examine the established hydrochemical conditions in the laboratory aquifers only cis dce was detected at the inflow of both aquifers with average concentrations of 15 mg l 1 and δ13cdce values of 23 5 0 4 si section g up to 90 of cis dce dissipated at the outflows after 35 days values of δ13c for cis dce were smaller δδ13cdce 2 at the outflows than δ13c values observed within the first 65 cm from inflow δδ13cdce 10 similarly vc concentrations of up to 6 and 12 mg l 1 were detected within the first 65 cm from inflow under steady state and transient conditions respectively and average δ13cvc values of 39 2 0 8 n 20 were formed along the flow path δ13cvc standard 29 5 0 2 si section g together with the detection of ohrb see below this suggests that reductive dechlorination occurred in both aquifers in agreement with observations at the groundwater source hellal et al 2021 hermon et al 2018 3 2 water table fluctuations affect dcm mass dissipation and c and cl isotope fractionation the absence of gas phase dcm gas phase q l 0 13 µg l 1 sampling volume 2 cm3 in the uz z 65 cm and headspace z 80 cm of both aquifers throughout the experiment and inlet outlet dcm mass balance indicated that volatilization did not contribute significantly 10 to the overall dcm dissipation in both aquifers steep concentration gradients are generally formed across the capillary fringe due to slow diffusion in water and small vertical dispersivity jeannottat and hunkeler 2013 previous studies showed that mass transport of pce and tce from the sz to the uz i e within the 15 cm above the water table led to 90 smaller gas phase concentrations with respect to the aqueous phase concentrations at the water table under steady state jeanottat and hunkeler 2013 mccarthy and johnson 1993 while variations of vocs concentrations in the gas phase increase in the uz when the water table drops as a result of residual water being in contact with the gas concentrations decrease again when the water table is raised returning to concentration equilibrium jeannottat and hunkeler 2013 mccarthy and johnson 1993 hence undetected gas phase dcm concentrations in the uz z 65 cm and headspace z 80 cm is likely due to i the low non dimensional henry s coefficient of dcm of 0 0549 at 18 c gossett 1987 non dimensional henry s coefficient of pce and tce of 0 495 and 0 265 respectively ii the continuous replenishment of the aqueous phase by horizontal groundwater flow and iii measurements carried out under near equilibrium conditions before and after each water table fluctuation event in the sz dcm concentrations decreased along the flow path in both aquifers after 35 days a more pronounced dcm mass dissipation in the aquifer outlets was observed under transient 95 than under steady state 42 conditions fig 2 δ13c and δ37cl values of dcm in the inflow water remained constant throughout the experiments 46 3 0 5 and 3 5 0 12 respectively under both transient and steady state conditions dcm became significantly enriched in both 13c and 37cl fig 2 c and cl isotope data for dcm degradation showed a good fit to the rayleigh model eq 1 under both hydraulic regimes r2 0 92 si section h apparent c and cl isotope fractionation values ε bulk c and ε bulk cl of 23 6 3 2 and 8 7 1 6 respectively were larger under steady state than under transient conditions ε bulk c and ε bulk cl values of 11 8 2 0 and 3 1 0 6 respectively si section h in previous reports dcm volatilization was associated with low c and cl fractionation εc 0 65 and εcl 0 48 compared to dcm biodegradation huang et al 1999 thus the magnitude of ε bulk c and ε bulk cl values under both hydraulic regimes suggest that dcm biodegradation prevailed in the aquifers the extent of dcm biodegradation b along the flow path was calculated based on reported εc values ranging from 71 to 15 5 and εcl values from 7 to 5 2 torgonskaya et al 2019 chen et al 2018 lee et al 2015 the range of εc and εcl values was defined based on the assumption that both aerobic and anaerobic dcm degradation pathways co occur in both aquifers which is supported by hydrochemical variations and micro oxic environments in the groundwater source hermon et al 2018 values of b under steady state and transient conditions ranged from 22 to 55 and from 22 to 90 respectively table 1 corresponding to the dcm mass dissipation observed under both hydraulic regimes time dependent first order biodegradation rate constants λt were calculated according to the rayleigh model as described in the si of hermon et al 2018 with values of 3 4 10 3 d 1 and 5 7 10 3 d 1 under steady state and transient conditions respectively worthy of note similar in situ λt were estimated at the groundwater source of this study hermon et al 2018 thus demonstrating the established near natural settings within the laboratory aquifers 3 3 dcm transformation pathways under transient and steady state conditions estimated λc cl values were lower under steady state 1 92 0 30 p 0 03 than under transient conditions 3 58 0 42 p 0 01 fig 3 this suggests distinct dcm c cl bond cleavage mechanisms under dynamic hydrogeological conditions the calculated λc cl values under transient conditions fall within the range of reported λc cl values during anaerobic dcm degradation 3 40 7 89 and are similar to λc cl values reported for ca dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis 3 40 0 03 chen et al 2018 which suggests the prevalence of anaerobic dcm pathways most strikingly the lower λc cl value determined under steady state conditions 1 92 0 30 has not been reported previously still this value likely also reflects anaerobic dcm degradation given that so far higher λc cl values 8 1 to 11 2 are rather associated with aerobic dcm degradation pathways heraty et al 1999 torgonskaya et al 2019 si section i to date anaerobic dcm degradation by bacteria affiliated with the peptococcaceae family has been examined using c cl csia two distinct anaerobic degradation pathways were reported for dcm fermentation by dehalobacterium formicoaceticum λc cl 7 89 0 12 and dcm mineralization by ca dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis λc cl 3 40 0 03 and proposed to be associated with the wood ljungdahl pathway wlp chen et al 2018 2020 kleindienst et al 2019 in addition blázquez pallí et al 2019 reported a distinct λc cl value 5 9 0 3 for anaerobic dcm degradation by a dehalobacterium containing culture differing from that associated with dehalobacterium formicoaceticum λc cl value 7 89 0 12 although the two strains belong to the same genus different characteristics of the bacterial cell envelope or enzyme locations may result in distinct c and cl isotope fractionation trueba santiso et al 2017 the differences in λc cl values under steady state and transient conditions may thus reflect distinct c cl bond cleavage reactions and distinct anaerobic dcm degradation pathways further our findings suggest that the prevalence of a given pathway depend on hydrochemical and hydrogeological dynamics in aquifers nevertheless both laboratory aquifers likely feature a variety of dcm degrading microorganisms with the possibility of simultaneous operations of several different aerobic and anaerobic degradation pathways van breukelen 2007 in particular the slight increase in o2 levels in the fluctuation zone under transient conditions may be indicative of micro oxic environments si sections e and f however the λc cl values obtained in our aquifers rather suggest the dominance of different anaerobic dcm degradation pathways which is further supported by the presence of taxa associated to anoxic conditions see below 3 4 water table fluctuations affect bacterial community composition and distribution of dcm associated taxa in total 3 649 087 high quality sequences were obtained from which 69 and 31 corresponded to pore water n 56 and sand samples n 24 respectively rarefaction curves of diversity indices reached asymptotes with increasing sequencing depth indicating sufficient sequencing efforts to capture the biodiversity extent of bacterial communities in both pore water and sand samples si section j changes in bacterial diversity were analyzed using nmds ordination of relative otu abundance diversity in sand samples day 88 varied mainly as a function of o2 gradients in the sz and uz fig 4b in contrast differences in bacterial diversity in pore water samples day 0 80 between inlet and outlet reservoirs suggested bacterial adaptation to dcm contamination along the flow path fig 4a nevertheless similar bacterial diversity under transient and steady state conditions for both pore water and sand samples suggested that water table fluctuations did not play a major role in shaping the overall composition of bacterial communities si sections k and l dominant taxa in aquifers may be associated with pollutants degradation pathways in both aquifers firmicutes was the most abundant phylum in sand samples with up to 60 of retrieved sequences at lower depths z 15 cm si section l previous studies have shown the presence of this phylum in aquifers highly contaminated with vocs hellal et al 2021 wright et al 2017 moreover firmicutes bacteria are known to utilize dcm as a sole carbon source under anoxic conditions kleindienst et al 2017 hence the occurrence of firmicutes supports the prevalence of anaerobic dcm biodegradation in both aquifers in pore water samples the dominant otu was associated with desulfosporosinus under both steady state and transient conditions fig 5 under steady state conditions desulfosporosinus and geobacter represented on average 25 and 12 of obtained sequences in the sz respectively while dehalobacterium and dehalococcoides represented each approximately 10 fig 5 under transient conditions in contrast desulfosporosinus increased from 25 to 58 relative abundance between days 0 and 13 in the sz z 15 cm corresponding to the first water table fluctuation event fig 5 geobacter was the second most abundant genus in the sz representing up to 15 followed by dehalobacterium 4 co occurrence of desulfosporosinus geobacter sulfurospirillum and dehalococcoides was reported previously in aquifers contaminated with halogenated contaminants hellal et al 2021 wright et al 2017 this parallel enrichment of different otus without demonstrated association with dcm degradation suggest interspecies interactions in our laboratory aquifers such interactions could be indicative of concomitant degradation of dcm and other halogenated contaminants as shown recently in investigations of other contaminated sites hellal et al 2021 trueba santiso et al 2020 blázquez pallí et al 2019 hermon et al 2018 wright et al 2017 detection of bacterial genera associated with ohr such as dehalococcoides further supports the concomitant degradation of dcm and cis dce in our laboratory aquifers furthermore reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes such as cis dce relies on h2 as electron donor distefano et al 1992 recently it was proposed that dcm mineralization by ca d elyunquensis produces h2 and co2 chen et al 2020 which may sustain reductive dechlorination in mixed contaminant plumes notably for growth with dcm ca d elyunquensis requires the presence of h2 consuming partner populations performing h2 co2 reductive acetogenesis while dehalobacterium formicoaceticum showed a strong dependence on co2 chen et al 2020 concomitant degradation of dcm and chlorinated ethenes in contaminated aquifers may thus result from interspecies metabolic networks associated with dehalogenative metabolism more generally dynamic environmental conditions such as water table fluctuations can increase microbial metabolic activity pronk et al 2020 thus we hypothesized that in the present study water table fluctuations promoted a larger enrichment of desulfosporosinus compared to steady state conditions fig 5 kleindienst et al 2019 reported that ca d elyunquensis expressed similar wlp associated enzymes as those of dehalobacter and desulfosporosinus spp hence the similar c and cl isotope fractionation determined here for dcm biodegradation under transient conditions λc cl 3 58 0 42 and by ca dichloromethanomonas elyunquensis λc cl 3 40 0 03 chen et al 2018 suggest that strains of the desulfosporosinus genus may be dcm degrading in line with a previous report wright et al 2017 in contrast the higher abundance of dehalobacterium under steady state conditions and similar c fractionation values to those of a dehalobacterium containing culture blázquez pallí et al 2019 suggest the occurrence of a fermentative dcm metabolism by as yet unknown dehalobacterium strains λc cl 1 92 0 30 worthy of note a recent study proposed ca formimonas warabiya strain dcmf as a novel dcm fermenting bacterium of the peptococcaceae family capable of metabolizing dcm to acetate via the wlp holland et al 2021 si section i clearly bacteria associated with the peptococcaceae family may play an important role in dcm biodegradation at contaminated sites 4 conclusions our study examined the effect of dynamic environmental conditions such as water table fluctuations on i hydrochemical conditions ii bacterial responses and in turn iii on dcm degradation pathways in multi contaminated aquifers our integrative approach combining c cl csia and biomolecular analyses suggested the prevalence of two distinct possibly co occurring anaerobic dcm degradation pathways under steady state and transient conditions bacterial diversity and distribution of dcm associated taxa was similar under both conditions however responses to water table fluctuations resulted in different bacterial community composition dominated by bacteria from the peptococcaceae family in particular desulfosporosinus sp we showed that environmental dynamics which are often excluded from laboratory degradation experiments can affect in situ dcm transformation while current knowledge of anaerobic transformation pathways of dcm limits interpretation of dcm in situ biodegradation fundamental research considering dynamics of environmental conditions are needed to improve bioremediation approaches at dcm contaminated sites in the future credit authorship contribution statement maria prieto espinoza investigation methodology data curation visualization formal

16714,sars cov 2 the novel coronavirus was first detected in wuhan china in december 2019 and has since spread rapidly causing millions of deaths worldwide as in most countries of the world in brazil the consequences of the covid 19 pandemic have been catastrophic several studies have reported the fecal shedding of sars cov 2 rna titers from infected symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals therefore the quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater can be used to track the virus spread in a population in this study samples of untreated wastewater were collected for 44 weeks at five sampling sites in the abc region são paulo brazil in order to evaluate the sars cov 2 occurrence in the sewerage system sars cov 2 rna titers were detected throughout the period and the concentration ranged from 2 7 to 7 7 log10 genome copies l 1 with peaks in the last weeks of monitoring furthermore we observed a positive correlation between the viral load in wastewater and the epidemiological clinical data with the former preceding the latter by approximately two weeks the covid 19 prevalence for each sampling site was estimated via monte carlo simulation using the wastewater viral load the mean predicted prevalence ranged 0 05 to 0 38 slightly higher than reported 0 016 0 005 in the abc region for the same period these results highlight the viability of the wastewater surveillance for covid 19 infection monitoring in the largest urban agglomeration in south america this approach can be especially useful for health agencies and public decision makers in predicting sars cov 2

detected rna concentrations of 5 4 0 2 log10 genome copies l 1 on average in the region of murcia spain data from wastewater monitoring were compared to the historical series of cases of covid 19 which showed that community members were shedding sars cov 2 rna titers before the first cases were reported by local epidemiological authorities kumar et al 2021a also observed the early occurrence of sars cov 2 from wastewater data in ahmedabad gujarat india the authors observed a correlation between the sars cov 2 amount in wastewater and reported cases of covid 19 with the former preceding the latter by 1 to 2 weeks although the fecal oral transmission pathway has not been proven monitoring of wastewater in the sewer network sewer pipes and municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps could support in predicting new sars cov 2 outbreaks as well as in the local tracing of infection clusters thompson et al 2020 wastewater surveillance is a methodology originally designed to monitor the use of illicit drugs in a community that now has been applied to covid 19 wastewater surveillance data could complement epidemiological clinical data to provide a robust tool for monitoring the sars cov 2 circulation daughton 2020 larsen and wigginton 2020 medema et al 2020 this methodology has been successfully used for predicting the outbreak of aichi virus in the netherlands lodder et al

countries with high population density such as brazil india bangladesh pakistan sri lanka among other countries whose clinical testing capabilities are limited bhattacharya et al 2021 wastewater provides an aggregated sample of an entire area or sub basin while clinical testing provides pooled individual data in addition to reducing monitoring costs wastewater surveillance provides more easily accessible data bivins et al 2020b furthermore this methodology allows for the tracking of asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic individuals who are generally not detected during clinical

wastewater from five points of the abc region são paulo brazil was collected and analyzed for 44 weeks between june 9th 2020 and april 7th 2021 for the sars cov 2 rna occurrence all monitored points are shown in fig 1 additional information on sampling points is shown in table 1 the sampling points represent the different income levels in the region besides there are also differences in the level of urbanization access to basic sanitation and the flow of wastewater generated in the wwtps points 1 and 5 24 hour composite sampling of 1000 ml proportional to the hourly flow rate was performed using a refrigerated hach automatic sampler model awrs as950 with a storage temperature of 4 c in the sewer pipes points 2 3 and 4 4 hour semi composite sampling proportional to the hourly flow rate was carried out using the same automatic sampler these sampling strategies allow a greater representation of the wastewater characteristics the sampling frequency was weekly at all monitoring sites 2 2 wastewater concentration and rna extraction viral particles were concentrated by the precipitation method as described by wu et al 2020 briefly 40 ml of samples were centrifuged at 8000xg for 120 min at 4 c and the pellet was resuspended in 0 4 ml of 1x pbs ph 7 2 for sample cleaning 1 ml of acid phenol was added and mixed strongly cabral et al 2020 an aqueous phase was then formed by centrifugation at 12 000xg for 10 min and transferred to a microtube containing 0 3 ml of lysis buffer rna extraction was performed using the purelink viral rna dna mini kit thermo fisher scientific according to the manufacturer s protocol the concentration of rna was measured in the nanodrop lite thermo fisher scientific to assess the quality of the process of genetic material nucleic acids extraction the enveloped bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv inforce 3 zoetis us was used for evaluated concentration methods recovery capacity 2 3 viral detection and quantification the presence of sars cov 2 genetic rna components was determined using the 2019 ncov taqman rt pcr kit norgen cat tm67120 based on the assays and protocols developed by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the rt qpcr was carried out following the manufacturer s instructions recommended standards and positive controls in a rotor gene q qiagen instrument each rna extract was analyzed in duplicate a calibration curve showed in fig 2 was performed using the 2019 ncov n positive control norgen cat pc67102 reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 μl using 5 μl of the extracted rna 10 µl of 2x one step rt pcr master mix 1 5 µl of primer probe mix and 3 5 µl of rnase free water a series of positive four 10 fold serial dilutions and negative controls extraction and pcr were included for each rt qpcr run by n1 and n2 genome target a calibration curve for n1 y 3 491x 43 065 r2 0 996 efficiency 93 4 and n2 y 3 723x 44 750 r2 0 998 efficiency 85 6 showed a linear dynamic the limit of detection lod was 10 genome copies for a ct value of 39 28 0 05 and 39 77 0 58 for n1 and n2 respectively the cycling program followed cycle 1 50 c for 30 minutes cycle 2 95 c for 3 minutes cycle 3 45 95 c for 3 seconds and 55 c for 30 seconds acquiring fluorescence in the green filter as the probes contain fam fluorescence cycle threshold ct values were used to calculate gc l in the original sample ct values lower than 40 were considered positive for sars cov 2 as proposed previously medema et al 2020 wu et al 2020 inhibition test was performed on wastewater samples and no significant difference was found between concentrated rna and 10x diluted rna thus it was decided to use concentrated samples in all analyses brsv rt qpcr reactions were performed to evaluate the recovery capacity of the concentration methods according to previous protocols described by rajal et al 2007 and boxus et al 2005 recovery rates between 20 and 65 were obtained 2 4 prevalence estimation the infected population in the abc region was estimated using the sars cov 2 viral load measured in wastewater and other parameters according to the following equation ahmed et al 2020a saththasivam et al 2021 1 infected population n c rna f α β where crna sars cov 2 rna concentration measured in wastewater samples genome copies l 1 f wastewater volumetric flow rate l d 1 α fecal load g person 1 d 1 β sars cov 2 shedding rate by an infected individual genome copies g 1 in the wwtps points 1 and 5 the wastewater volumetric flow rate f was measured in loco while for the sewer pipes points points 2 3 and 4 it was estimated from the per capita wastewater generation 160 l person 1 d 1 and the contributing population table 1 the daily fecal mass α produced by humans from low income countries usually ranges from 75 to 520 grams per person with an average value of 149 95 g person 1 d 1 according to rose et al 2015 the sars cov 2 shedding rate by an infected individual β usually ranges from 6 3 105 to 1 3 108 genome copies g 1 according to kitajima et al 2020 and gholipour et al 2021 thus the covid 19 average prevalence was estimated for each sampling site considering the contributing population table 1 according to the following equation 2 predicted prevalence n contributing population 100 2 5 statistical analysis the one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine whether there were differences among the mean sars cov 2 rna concentrations of each sampling site considering a significance level of 0 05 the statistical monte carlo approach was incorporated into the calculation of the prevalence estimate equations 1 and 2 since parameters such as fecal load α and sars cov 2 shedding rate β have large variation which makes it difficult to interpret the results of the infected population n and consequently the predicted prevalence monte carlo simulation with 10 000 random samplings from each parameter input of equation 1 was implemented the parameters values and their respective types of statistical distribution were shown in table 2 the monte carlo simulation summary was reported as mean and 95 confidence interval ci for each sampling point statistical analysis was performed using origin pro while the monte carlo simulation was implemented in microsoft excel 3 results and discussion 3 1 sars cov 2 rna occurrence in wastewater samples a total of 220 untreated wastewater samples from five points of the abc region são paulo brazil were analyzed between june 9th 2020 and april 7th 2021 44 weeks for the sars cov 2 rna occurrence samples with ct cycle threshold less than 40 were considered positive and had their concentrations determined genome copies sample volume according to medema et al 2020 and wu et al 2020 fig 3 shows the temporal variation in sars cov 2 concentration for the five sampling points for the entire monitoring period the rt qpcr n1 and n2 gene assays were analyzed for all wastewater samples however as shown in fig 3 there was a higher sars cov 2 occurrence for the n1 target the sars cov 2 rna was detected in 53 116 220 and 34 74 220 of wastewater samples for n1 and n2 gene assays respectively the differences among n1 and n2 assays on wastewater samples were also reported by other recent studies medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 this could be associated with the different analytical sensitivity between the rt qpcr gene assays randazzo et al 2020 furthermore different pcr reactions may not be identically susceptible to the inhibitory effects of the evaluated matrix bustin et al 2009 as in this study medema et al 2020 verified a higher sensitivity for n1 gene assay detecting sars cov 2 rna titers for a greater number of monitoring points even when clinical data indicated a low prevalence of 1 case per 100 000 inhabitants kumar et al 2021b kumar et al 2021b evaluated the efficacy of two different treatment process for sars cov 2 rna removal namely conventional activated sludge and root zone treatment the authors analyzed three different rt qpcr gene assays sars cov 2n genes nucleocapsid protein s genes spike glycoprotein and orf 1ab genes polyprotein the results indicated that regardless of the treatment system the n gene was more stable than the others orf 1ab and s genes were more sensitive to treatment processes according to the authors this stability and persistence occur because the nucleocapsid protein n gene is more protected in the viral structure as shown in fig 3 except for point 1 the sars cov 2 occurrence in the first weeks was less frequent however from november onwards the sars cov 2 rna titers were detected in most of the wastewater samples coincidentally at that same time there were signs of the beginning of a second wave and or recurring local outbreaks of covid 19 in brazil sabino et al 2021 in january february march and april 2021 the sars cov 2 rna was detected in 82 23 28 89 25 28 82 23 28 67 19 28 and 71 20 28 of the wastewater samples from points 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively clearly indicating the late spread of sars cov 2 in the abc region fig 4 shows the box plot of the sars cov 2 viral load n1 and n2 assays per sampling point for the entire monitoring period there were no statistical differences among the mean sars cov 2 rna concentrations of each sampling point as determined by the one way analysis of variance anova considering a significance level of 0 05 also no statistical differences were detected between the means of n1 and n2 assays however there was greater variability in the n2 data as shown in fig 4 table 3 shows the mean minimum and maximum sars cov 2 rna concentrations for n1 and n2 gene assays obtained in the present study and in other relevant works naturally there are differences between the viral loads measured in wastewater samples from the abc region and those found in other studies around the world according to prado et al 2021 different factors can influence the viral load determination including the circumstances of the covid 19 pandemic experienced in each region besides we believe that the specificities of the sewage and the sewer network in each region also affect the experimental determinations in brazil sewage and surface run off rainwater and stormwater are collected separately however there is a high rate of clandestine connections to the sewer network which promotes the dilution of sewage during rainy events furthermore there are particularities of each research laboratory regarding sampling concentration and detection of the virus although it is not possible to determine absolute virus concentrations in wastewater the use of this methodology can be very effective in tracking the virus predicting outbreaks and monitoring the pandemic as will be discussed in the next section the results of this work have been shared with federal government health and scientific research authorities through weekly reports the monitoring of different sampling points enables localized action by the authorities in the most affected regions according to wastewater information 3 2 environmental surveillance fig 5 shows the spread of the sars cov 2 in the abc region for different dates considering the viral load measured n1 assay in the wastewater samples the heat maps were made using qgis software the color scale ranged from the highest red color to the lowest white color sars cov 2 rna concentration considering the period analyzed as observed in fig 5 the sars cov 2 rna concentration from all sampling sites increased gradually over time indicating the spread of covid 19 infection in the abc region at the beginning of monitoring june 2020 the amount of sars cov 2 rna titers in wastewater samples were much less expressive than those found in the last weeks as previously shown this behavior was also observed for the ct results fig 3 the presentation of monitoring results through heat maps can be especially useful for health agencies since it allows the spatial analysis of the pandemic situation epidemiological clinical data on covid 19 in the abc region was obtained from the publicly available repository of the federal university of abc onde tem coronavirus project available at https ondetemcoronavirus ufabc edu br fig 6 shows the new cases during the monitoring period normalized by each city s population the cumulative prevalence of covid 19 in percentage considering all municipalities of the abc region was also plotted as shown in fig 6 although there is a wide variability of data an upward trend of covid 19 cases in the abc region can be observed especially from november onwards as previously discussed the sars cov 2 occurrences in wastewater samples showed the same behavior fig 3 fig 7 shows the sars cov 2 viral load n1 assay in the five sampling points throughout the monitoring period despite the relatively large variance an upward trend in sars cov 2 viral load red arrow was observed for the five monitoring points fig 7 following the continuous increase of reported clinical cases fig 6 therefore there is a correlation between the amount of sars cov 2 in wastewater and the hospitalization data as observed by other authors medema et al 2020 miyani et al 2020 prado et al 2021 saththasivam et al 2021 however few studies have reported long term monitoring over several months of sars cov 2 in wastewater prado et al 2021 saguti et al 2021 a large dataset allows for more robust statistical analysis and therefore a more reliable model for wastewater surveillance daughton 2020 fig 8 shows the sars cov 2 amount n1 assay for samples of point 1 wwtp abc in relation to the number of new covid 19 cases of abc region the temporal delay between the sars cov 2 rna peaks for wastewater samples and clinical data are indicated with black arrows point 1 was chosen for this comparative analysis since it receives most of the wastewater generated in the abc region and therefore is the most representative monitoring point as observed in fig 8 there is a correlation between the sars cov 2 amount variation in wastewater and the clinical data on covid 19 with the former preceding the latter by approximately 14 days two weeks these results are consistent since the transmission of sars cov 2 generally precedes the notification of a positive test by 2 to 3 weeks this time interval corresponds to an incubation period between 2 and 14 days followed by clinical testing about a week after symptoms onset bi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 saguti et al 2021 other studies have observed the same behavior ahmed et al 2021 la rosa et al 2020 medema et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 saguti et al 2021 saguti et al 2021 for example verified peaks of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples from a wwtp in sweden occurring 3 to 4 weeks before clinical notification ahmed et al 2021 detected sars cov 2 in wastewater samples from three wwtps in australia up to 3 weeks before the first reported clinical case peccia et al 2020 observed a shorter delay of about a week when analyzing samples of primary sludge from a wwtp in usa in florianopolis santa catarina brazil the viral genome of sars cov 2 was detected in wastewater samples in november 2019 before the first case in the americas was reported the sars cov 2 occurrence was confirmed by genome sequencing analysis the mean concentration was 5 83 0 12 log10 genome copies l 1 while the maximum and minimum values were 6 68 0 02 and 5 49 0 02 log10 genome copies l 1 respectively fongaro et al 2021 these results indicate that wastewater surveillance can be used successfully as an early warning system for monitoring covid 19 this methodology allows verifying the increase or reduction in the number of active cases about 2 weeks in advance in addition since the monitoring can be regionalized by sewer sub basins control actions by health agencies can be directed to the infection and transmission clusters 3 3 prevalence estimate the covid 19 prevalence for each sampling site shown in table 4 was estimated using the sars cov 2 rna titers data n1 assay and other parameters equations 1 and 2 the positive results for sars cov 2 occurrence of all monitoring weeks were considered the predicted prevalence of covid 19 resulting from the monte carlo simulation was summarized in table 4 as mean and 95 confidence interval ci lower and upper the average prevalence in percentage in the abc region for the same period june 9th 2020 april 7th 2021 was 0 016 0 005 as shown in table 4 the predicted values were much higher about 10 times than the observed covid 19 prevalence considering epidemiological clinical data wu et al 2020 also estimated prevalence values 0 1 5 higher than those reported about 0 026 in massachusetts usa although the wastewater surveillance approach emerges as a promising and attractive tool for epidemiological surveillance there are still some challenges to be considered some factors that influence the prevalence estimation model the municipal wastewater is a complex matrix with different chemical organic and inorganic and biological compounds in general it provides a lot of information about the habits and characteristics of a population however some of its constituents may contribute to the degradation of sars cov 2 rna mao et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 bivins et al 2020a bivins et al 2020a observed a time for 90 reduction t90 of viable sars cov 2 in untreated wastewater about 26 2 days at 20 c ahmed et al 2020b ahmed et al 2020b verified a t90 of 20 4 and 12 6 days at 15 and 25 c respectively as expected the decay rate increases as the temperature also increase although the wastewater residence times in the sewer network are not so long the effect of degradation must be considered especially in warm climate regions zhu et al 2021 furthermore sampling sites that represent large areas and basins such as the wwtp points are more susceptible to the degradation effect of the viral genome during wastewater travel there are discrepancies regarding viral shedding by humans some studies have indicated that only 60 70 of infected individuals shed sars cov 2 rna titers saguti et al 2021 wu et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 on the other hand other studies have already proved that asymptomatic and undiagnosed carriers also shedding sars cov 2 rna titers chavarria miró et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 kitajima et al 2020 there are also discrepancies in the viral load excreted by an infected individual wölfel et al 2020 observed a shedding rate between 2 56 and 7 67 log10 genome copies g feces 1 the shedding rates reported by kitajima et al 2020 range from 5 79 to 8 11 log10 genome copies g feces 1 there is still a great variation in the mass of feces eliminated by each infected individual as previously discussed another important aspect is the time that an infected individual remains to eliminate the sars cov 2 rna titers zheng et al 2020 observed that the sars cov 2 duration in feces samples is significantly longer than in serum and respiratory samples the average duration of the virus in feces samples was 22 days interquartile range from 17 to 31 days while in respiratory and serum samples were 18 and 16 days respectively thus an infected individual remains to eliminate the virus even when it is no longer considered an active case in addition to the above mentioned factors there are still limitations and uncertainty in the sampling strategies and in the methods of concentration extraction and quantification of sars cov 2 rna daughton 2020 zhu et al 2021 therefore an absolute comparison between the observed covid 19 prevalence and the sars cov 2 rna concentrations in wastewater is significantly complex on other hand as also attested by medema et al 2020 the epidemiological surveillance based on relative changes in sars cov 2 rna titers from wastewater samples of sewer pipes and wwtp over time can be used as an additional monitoring tool capable of providing an early warning of sars cov 2 circulation 4 conclusions in this study a long term monitoring of sars cov 2 occurrence in wastewater samples was performed five sampling sites in the abc region são paulo brazil were evaluated we observed a positive correlation between the viral load in wastewater samples and the epidemiological clinical data with the former preceding the latter by approximately two weeks the long term monitoring 44 weeks allowed to assess different moments of the pandemic in the studied area such as the increase in cases of covid 19 in the first months of 2021 the worst period of the pandemic in the abc region the findings of this study indicate that wastewater surveillance can provide a powerful tool to complement the monitoring of covid 19 infection in brazil supporting in the predicting of sars cov 2 outbreaks as well as in the local tracing of infection clusters the wastewater surveillance is especially useful for health agencies and public decision makers and should be incorporated in the country s epidemiological surveillance and public policy development the spread of the virus can be monitored in large communities from a few wastewater samples reducing analytical costs which is especially important for emerging and low income countries like brazil furthermore this methodology allows for the tracking of asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic individuals who are generally not detected during clinical surveillance this research is a step towards the improvement of wastewater surveillance to track covid 19 the evolution of wastewater surveillance must be one of the legacies of the covid 19 pandemic this unfortunate moment made it possible to implement the methodology at least at the research level in different parts of the world it is expected that the methodology will be effectively used for monitoring and predicting new events like this one declaration of competing interest the

16714,sars cov 2 the novel coronavirus was first detected in wuhan china in december 2019 and has since spread rapidly causing millions of deaths worldwide as in most countries of the world in brazil the consequences of the covid 19 pandemic have been catastrophic several studies have reported the fecal shedding of sars cov 2 rna titers from infected symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals therefore the quantification of sars cov 2 in wastewater can be used to track the virus spread in a population in this study samples of untreated wastewater were collected for 44 weeks at five sampling sites in the abc region são paulo brazil in order to evaluate the sars cov 2 occurrence in the sewerage system sars cov 2 rna titers were detected throughout the period and the concentration ranged from 2 7 to 7 7 log10 genome copies l 1 with peaks in the last weeks of monitoring furthermore we observed a positive correlation between the viral load in wastewater and the epidemiological clinical data with the former preceding the latter by approximately two weeks the covid 19 prevalence for each sampling site was estimated via monte carlo simulation using the wastewater viral load the mean predicted prevalence ranged 0 05 to 0 38 slightly higher than reported 0 016 0 005 in the abc region for the same period these results highlight the viability of the wastewater surveillance for covid 19 infection monitoring in the largest urban agglomeration in south america this approach can be especially useful for health agencies and public decision makers in predicting sars cov 2

bed occupancy is 69 for hospital ward and 83 for icu data source https www seade gov br coronavirus the severity of the situation highlights the need for alternative techniques for monitoring the virus studies have shown that the sars cov 2 is also shed in feces from infected symptomatic oligosymptomatic and asymptomatic individuals kitajima et al 2020 wölfel et al 2020 determined a shedding rate greater than 107 rna copies g feces 1 one week after symptom onset however no viable infective viral particles were found based on cell cultures on the other hand other recent studies have verified the presence of viable particle viral in feces wang et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 several studies have also shown the presence of sars cov 2 in municipal wastewater samples in the netherlands medema et al 2020 spain randazzo et al 2020 australia ahmed et al 2020a usa wu et al 2020 india kumar et al 2020 2021a brazil prado et al 2021 among other countries randazzo et al 2020 for example detected rna concentrations of 5 4 0 2 log10 genome copies l 1 on average in the region of murcia spain data from wastewater monitoring were compared to the historical series of cases of covid 19 which showed that community members were shedding sars cov 2 rna titers before the first cases were reported by local epidemiological authorities kumar et al 2021a also observed the early occurrence of sars cov 2 from wastewater data in ahmedabad gujarat india the authors observed a correlation between the sars cov 2 amount in wastewater and reported cases of covid 19 with the former preceding the latter by 1 to 2 weeks although the fecal oral transmission pathway has not been proven monitoring of wastewater in the sewer network sewer pipes and municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps could support in predicting new sars cov 2 outbreaks as well as in the local tracing of infection clusters thompson et al 2020 wastewater surveillance is a methodology originally designed to monitor the use of illicit drugs in a community that now has been applied to covid 19 wastewater surveillance data could complement epidemiological clinical data to provide a robust tool for monitoring the sars cov 2 circulation daughton 2020 larsen and wigginton 2020 medema et al 2020 this methodology has been successfully used for predicting the outbreak of aichi virus in the netherlands lodder et al 2013 and poliovirus in israel brouwer et al 2018 and for monitoring the antibiotic resistance on a global scale hendriksen et al 2019 wastewater surveillance is interesting especially for emerging countries with high population density such as brazil india bangladesh pakistan sri lanka among other countries whose clinical testing capabilities are limited bhattacharya et al 2021 wastewater provides an aggregated sample of an entire area or sub basin while clinical testing provides pooled individual data in addition to reducing monitoring costs wastewater surveillance provides more easily accessible data bivins et al 2020b furthermore this methodology allows for the tracking of asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic individuals who are generally not detected during clinical surveillance bhattacharya et al 2021 bivins et al 2020b kumar et al 2021a van der voorn et al 2021 in brazil this methodology for tracking the virus spread has been used in the metropolitan region of rio de janeiro prado et al 2021 as in other countries the monitoring results have been successfully used as complementary data in the covid 19 surveillance by the local authorities however as attested by daughton 2020 daughton 2020 the data published so far is insufficient for the wastewater surveillance implementation there is still a need for a large time series data of concentration of sars cov 2 genetic rna components in wastewater that combined with epidemiological data to prove the usefulness of wastewater surveillance kumar et al 2021a furthermore there are many epidemiological shedding profile of infected individuals among others and methodological sampling strategies and experimental methods aspects to be elucidated zhu et al 2021 in this context this study aimed to implement a low cost wastewater surveillance methodology to monitor the sars cov 2 circulation in low income areas in abc region metropolitan region of sao paulo brazil this region has the largest urban agglomeration in south america this methodology can support decision making by local health agencies in combating the covid 19 pandemic 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling sites and samples collection untreated wastewater from five points of the abc region são paulo brazil was collected and analyzed for 44 weeks between june 9th 2020 and april 7th 2021 for the sars cov 2 rna occurrence all monitored points are shown in fig 1 additional information on sampling points is shown in table 1 the sampling points represent the different income levels in the region besides there are also differences in the level of urbanization access to basic sanitation and the flow of wastewater generated in the wwtps points 1 and 5 24 hour composite sampling of 1000 ml proportional to the hourly flow rate was performed using a refrigerated hach automatic sampler model awrs as950 with a storage temperature of 4 c in the sewer pipes points 2 3 and 4 4 hour semi composite sampling proportional to the hourly flow rate was carried out using the same automatic sampler these sampling strategies allow a greater representation of the wastewater characteristics the sampling frequency was weekly at all monitoring sites 2 2 wastewater concentration and rna extraction viral particles were concentrated by the precipitation method as described by wu et al 2020 briefly 40 ml of samples were centrifuged at 8000xg for 120 min at 4 c and the pellet was resuspended in 0 4 ml of 1x pbs ph 7 2 for sample cleaning 1 ml of acid phenol was added and mixed strongly cabral et al 2020 an aqueous phase was then formed by centrifugation at 12 000xg for 10 min and transferred to a microtube containing 0 3 ml of lysis buffer rna extraction was performed using the purelink viral rna dna mini kit thermo fisher scientific according to the manufacturer s protocol the concentration of rna was measured in the nanodrop lite thermo fisher scientific to assess the quality of the process of genetic material nucleic acids extraction the enveloped bovine respiratory syncytial virus brsv inforce 3 zoetis us was used for evaluated concentration methods recovery capacity 2 3 viral detection and quantification the presence of sars cov 2 genetic rna components was determined using the 2019 ncov taqman rt pcr kit norgen cat tm67120 based on the assays and protocols developed by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc the rt qpcr was carried out following the manufacturer s instructions recommended standards and positive controls in a rotor gene q qiagen instrument each rna extract was analyzed in

limit of detection lod was 10 genome copies for a ct value of 39 28 0 05 and 39 77 0 58 for n1 and n2 respectively the cycling program followed cycle 1 50 c for 30 minutes cycle 2 95 c for 3 minutes cycle 3 45 95 c for 3 seconds and 55 c for 30 seconds acquiring fluorescence in the green filter as the probes contain fam fluorescence cycle threshold ct values were used to calculate gc l in the original sample ct values lower than 40 were considered positive for sars cov 2 as proposed previously medema et al 2020 wu et al 2020 inhibition test was performed on wastewater samples and no significant difference was found between concentrated rna and 10x diluted rna thus it was decided to use concentrated samples in all analyses brsv rt qpcr reactions were performed to evaluate the recovery capacity of the concentration methods according to previous protocols described by rajal et al 2007 and boxus et al 2005 recovery rates between 20 and 65 were obtained 2 4 prevalence

load g person 1 d 1 β sars cov 2 shedding rate by an infected individual genome copies g 1 in the wwtps points 1 and 5 the wastewater volumetric flow rate f was measured in loco while for the sewer pipes points points 2 3 and 4 it was estimated from the per capita wastewater generation 160 l person 1 d 1 and the contributing population table 1 the daily fecal mass α produced by humans from low income countries usually ranges from 75 to 520 grams per person with an average value of 149 95 g person 1 d 1 according to rose et al 2015 the sars cov 2 shedding rate by an infected individual β usually ranges from 6 3 105 to 1 3 108 genome copies g 1 according to kitajima et al 2020 and gholipour et al 2021 thus the covid 19 average prevalence was estimated for each sampling site considering the contributing population table 1 according to the following equation 2 predicted prevalence n contributing population 100 2 5 statistical analysis the one way analysis of variance anova was used to determine whether there were differences among the mean sars cov 2 rna concentrations of each sampling site considering a significance level of 0 05 the statistical monte carlo approach was incorporated into the calculation of the prevalence estimate equations 1 and 2 since parameters such as fecal load α and sars cov 2 shedding rate β have large variation which makes it difficult to interpret the results of the infected population n and consequently the predicted prevalence monte carlo simulation with 10 000 random samplings from each parameter input of equation 1 was implemented the parameters values and their respective types of statistical distribution were shown in table 2 the monte carlo simulation summary was reported as mean and 95 confidence interval ci for each sampling point statistical analysis was performed using origin pro while the monte carlo simulation was implemented in microsoft excel 3 results and discussion 3 1 sars cov 2 rna occurrence in wastewater samples a total of 220 untreated wastewater samples from five points of the abc region são paulo brazil were analyzed between june 9th 2020 and april 7th 2021 44 weeks for the sars cov 2 rna occurrence samples with ct cycle threshold less than 40 were considered positive and had their concentrations determined genome copies sample volume according to medema et al 2020 and wu et al 2020 fig 3 shows the temporal variation in sars cov 2 concentration for the five sampling points for the entire monitoring period the rt qpcr n1 and n2 gene assays were analyzed for all wastewater samples however as shown in fig 3 there was a higher sars cov 2 occurrence for the n1 target the sars cov 2 rna was detected in 53 116 220 and 34 74 220 of wastewater samples for n1 and n2 gene assays respectively the differences among n1 and n2 assays on wastewater samples were also reported by other recent studies medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 this could be associated with the different analytical sensitivity between the rt qpcr gene assays randazzo et al 2020 furthermore different pcr reactions may not be identically susceptible to the inhibitory effects of the evaluated matrix bustin et al 2009 as in this study medema et al 2020 verified a higher sensitivity for n1 gene assay detecting sars cov 2 rna titers for a greater number of monitoring points even when clinical data indicated a low prevalence of 1 case per 100 000 inhabitants kumar et al 2021b kumar et al 2021b evaluated the efficacy of two different treatment process for sars cov 2 rna removal namely conventional activated sludge and root zone treatment the authors analyzed three different rt qpcr gene assays sars cov 2n genes nucleocapsid protein s genes spike glycoprotein and orf 1ab genes polyprotein the results indicated that regardless of the treatment system the n gene was more stable than the others orf 1ab and s genes were more sensitive to treatment processes according to the authors this stability and persistence occur because the nucleocapsid protein n gene is more protected in the viral structure as shown in fig 3 except for point 1 the sars cov 2 occurrence in the first weeks was less frequent however from november onwards the sars cov 2 rna titers were detected in most of the wastewater samples coincidentally at that same time there were signs of the beginning of a second wave and or recurring local outbreaks of covid 19 in brazil sabino et al 2021 in january february march and april 2021 the sars cov 2 rna was detected in 82 23 28 89 25 28 82 23 28 67 19 28 and 71 20 28 of the wastewater samples from points 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively clearly indicating the late spread of sars cov 2 in the abc region fig 4 shows the box plot of the sars cov 2 viral load n1 and n2 assays per sampling point for the entire monitoring period there were no statistical differences among the mean sars cov 2 rna concentrations of each sampling point as determined by the one way analysis of variance anova considering a significance level of 0 05 also no statistical differences were detected between the means of n1 and n2 assays however there was greater variability in the n2 data as shown in fig 4 table 3 shows the mean minimum and maximum sars cov 2 rna concentrations for n1 and n2 gene assays obtained in the present study and in other relevant works naturally there are differences between the viral loads measured in wastewater samples from the abc region and those found in other studies around the world according to prado et al 2021 different factors can influence the viral load determination including the circumstances of the covid 19 pandemic experienced in each region besides we believe that the specificities of the sewage and the sewer network in each region also affect the experimental determinations in brazil sewage and surface run off rainwater and stormwater are collected separately however there is a high rate of clandestine connections to the sewer network which promotes the dilution of sewage during rainy events furthermore there are particularities of each research laboratory regarding sampling concentration and detection of the virus although it is not possible to determine absolute virus concentrations in wastewater the use of this methodology can be very effective in tracking the virus predicting outbreaks and monitoring the pandemic as will be discussed in the next section the results of this work have been shared with federal government health and scientific research authorities through weekly reports the monitoring of different sampling points enables localized action by the authorities in the most affected regions according to wastewater information 3 2 environmental surveillance fig 5 shows the spread of the sars cov 2 in the abc region for different dates considering the viral load measured n1 assay in the wastewater samples the heat maps were made using qgis software the color scale ranged from the highest red color to the lowest white color sars cov 2 rna concentration considering the period analyzed as observed in fig 5 the sars cov 2 rna concentration from all sampling sites increased gradually over time indicating the spread of covid 19 infection in the abc region at the beginning of monitoring june 2020 the amount of sars cov 2 rna titers in wastewater samples were much less expressive than those found in the last weeks as previously shown this behavior was also observed for the ct results fig 3 the presentation of monitoring results through heat maps can be especially useful for health agencies since it allows the spatial analysis of the pandemic situation epidemiological clinical data on covid 19 in the abc region was obtained from the publicly available repository of the federal university of abc onde tem coronavirus project available at https ondetemcoronavirus ufabc edu br fig 6 shows the new cases during the monitoring period normalized by each city s population the cumulative prevalence of covid 19 in percentage considering all municipalities of the abc region was also plotted as shown in fig 6 although there is a wide variability of data an upward trend of covid 19 cases in the abc region can be observed especially from november onwards as previously discussed the sars cov 2 occurrences in wastewater samples showed the same behavior fig 3 fig 7 shows the sars cov 2 viral load n1 assay in the five sampling points throughout the monitoring period despite the relatively large variance an upward trend in sars cov 2 viral load red arrow was observed for the five monitoring points fig 7 following the continuous increase of reported clinical cases fig 6 therefore there is a correlation between the amount of sars cov 2 in wastewater and the hospitalization data as observed by other authors medema et al 2020 miyani et al 2020 prado et al 2021 saththasivam et al 2021 however few studies have reported long term monitoring over several months of sars cov 2 in wastewater prado et al 2021 saguti et al 2021 a large dataset allows for more robust statistical analysis and therefore a more reliable model for wastewater surveillance daughton 2020 fig 8 shows the sars cov 2 amount n1 assay for samples of point 1 wwtp abc in relation to the number of new covid 19 cases of abc region the temporal delay between the sars cov 2 rna peaks for wastewater samples and clinical data are indicated with black arrows point 1 was chosen for this comparative analysis since it receives most of the wastewater generated in the abc region and therefore is the most representative monitoring point as observed in fig 8 there is a correlation between the sars cov 2 amount variation in wastewater and the clinical data on covid 19 with the former preceding the latter by approximately 14 days two weeks these results are consistent since the transmission of sars cov 2 generally precedes the notification of a positive test by 2 to 3 weeks this time interval corresponds to an incubation period between 2 and 14 days followed by clinical testing about a week after symptoms onset bi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 saguti et al 2021 other studies have observed the same behavior ahmed et al 2021 la rosa et al 2020 medema et al 2020 nemudryi et al 2020 peccia et al 2020 saguti et al 2021 saguti et al 2021 for example verified peaks of sars cov 2 in wastewater samples from a wwtp in sweden occurring 3 to 4 weeks before clinical notification ahmed et al 2021 detected sars cov 2 in wastewater samples from three wwtps in australia up to 3 weeks before the first reported clinical case peccia et al 2020 observed a shorter delay of about a week when analyzing samples of primary sludge from a wwtp in usa in florianopolis santa catarina brazil the viral genome of sars cov 2 was detected in wastewater samples in november 2019 before the first case in the americas was reported the sars cov 2 occurrence was confirmed by genome sequencing analysis the mean concentration was 5 83 0 12 log10 genome copies l 1 while the maximum and minimum values were 6 68 0 02 and 5 49 0 02 log10 genome copies l 1 respectively fongaro et al 2021 these results indicate that wastewater surveillance can be used successfully as an early warning system for monitoring covid 19 this methodology allows verifying the increase or reduction in the number of active cases about 2 weeks in advance in addition since the monitoring can be regionalized by sewer sub basins control actions by health agencies can be directed to the infection and transmission clusters 3 3 prevalence estimate the covid 19 prevalence for each sampling site shown in table 4 was estimated using the sars cov 2 rna titers data n1 assay and other parameters equations 1 and 2 the positive results for sars cov 2 occurrence of all monitoring weeks were considered the predicted prevalence of covid 19 resulting from the monte carlo simulation was summarized in table 4 as mean and 95 confidence interval ci lower and upper the average prevalence in percentage in the abc region for the same period june 9th 2020 april 7th 2021 was 0 016 0 005 as shown in table 4 the predicted values were much higher about 10 times than the observed covid 19 prevalence considering epidemiological clinical data wu et al 2020 also estimated prevalence values 0 1 5 higher than those reported about 0 026 in massachusetts usa although the wastewater surveillance approach emerges as a promising and attractive tool for epidemiological surveillance there are still some challenges to be considered some factors that influence the prevalence estimation model the municipal wastewater is a complex matrix with different chemical organic and inorganic and biological compounds in general it provides a lot of information about the habits and characteristics of a population however some of its constituents may contribute to the degradation of sars cov 2 rna mao et al 2020 zhu et al 2021 bivins et al 2020a bivins et al 2020a observed a time for 90 reduction t90 of viable sars cov 2 in untreated wastewater about 26 2 days at 20 c ahmed et al 2020b ahmed et al 2020b verified a t90 of 20 4 and 12 6 days at 15 and 25 c respectively as expected the decay rate increases as the temperature also increase although the wastewater residence times in the sewer network are not so long the effect of degradation must be considered especially in warm climate regions zhu et al 2021 furthermore sampling sites that represent large areas and basins such as the wwtp points are more susceptible to the degradation effect of the viral genome during wastewater travel there are discrepancies regarding viral shedding by humans some studies have indicated that only 60 70 of infected individuals shed sars cov 2 rna titers saguti et al 2021 wu et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 on the other hand other studies have already proved that asymptomatic and undiagnosed carriers also shedding sars cov 2 rna titers chavarria miró et al 2021 jiang et al 2020 kitajima et al 2020 there are also discrepancies in the viral load excreted by an infected individual wölfel et al 2020 observed a shedding rate between 2 56 and 7 67 log10 genome copies g feces 1 the shedding rates reported by kitajima et al 2020 range from 5 79 to 8 11 log10 genome copies g feces 1 there is still a great variation in the mass of feces eliminated by each infected individual as previously discussed another important aspect is the time that an infected individual remains to eliminate the sars cov 2 rna titers zheng et al 2020 observed that the sars cov 2 duration in feces samples is significantly longer than in serum and respiratory samples the average duration of the virus in feces samples was 22 days interquartile range from 17 to 31 days while in respiratory and serum samples were 18 and 16 days respectively thus an infected individual remains to eliminate the virus even when it is no longer considered an active case in addition to the above mentioned factors there are still limitations and uncertainty in the sampling strategies and in the methods of concentration extraction and quantification of sars cov 2 rna daughton 2020 zhu et al 2021 therefore an absolute comparison between the observed covid 19 prevalence and the sars cov 2 rna concentrations in wastewater is significantly complex on other hand as also attested by medema et al 2020 the epidemiological surveillance based on relative changes in sars cov 2 rna titers from wastewater samples of sewer pipes and wwtp over time can be used as an additional monitoring tool capable of providing an early warning of sars cov 2 circulation 4 conclusions in this study a long term monitoring of sars cov 2 occurrence in wastewater samples was performed five sampling sites in the abc region são paulo brazil were evaluated we observed a positive correlation between the viral load in wastewater samples and the epidemiological clinical data with the former preceding the latter by approximately two weeks the long term monitoring 44 weeks allowed to assess different moments of the pandemic in the studied area such as the increase in cases of covid 19 in the first months of 2021 the worst period of the pandemic in the abc region the findings of this study indicate that wastewater surveillance can provide a powerful tool to complement the monitoring of covid 19 infection in brazil supporting in the predicting of sars cov 2 outbreaks as well as in the local tracing of infection clusters the wastewater surveillance is especially useful for health agencies and public decision makers and should be incorporated in the country s epidemiological surveillance and public policy development the spread of the virus can be monitored in large communities from a few wastewater samples reducing analytical costs which is especially important for emerging and low income countries like brazil furthermore this methodology allows for the tracking of asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic individuals who are generally not detected during clinical surveillance this research is a step towards the improvement of wastewater surveillance to track covid 19 the evolution of wastewater surveillance must be one of the legacies of the covid 19 pandemic this unfortunate moment made it possible to implement the methodology at least at the research level in different parts of the world it is expected that the methodology will be effectively used for monitoring and predicting new events like this one declaration of competing interest the
