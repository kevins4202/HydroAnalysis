obtained colonies were presented as colony forming unit per millilitre sample cfu ml as depicted in fig 1 on the basis of fig 1 the number of colonies were 6 40 0 02 6 39 00 6 33 0 04 and 5 09 0 13 log cfu ml for sl wl ss and ws samples respectively the number of colonies from the ws sample was significantly lower compared with that of other samples from the samples 21 bacterial colonies were obtained and tabulated as shown in table 1 3 2 screening of flocculation activity and selection of potential bacteria flocculation activities exhibited by each bioflocculant at the screening stage are presented in fig 2 all bacteria showed flocculation activities ranging from 6 9 to 49 2 the control reactor showed turbidity removal of 36 0 whereas the addition of bioflocculant could increase the total removal to 68 0 most of the bioflocculant showed a significant increment in terms of the turbidity removal compared with the control reactor indicating that the bioflocculant showed a good contribution to the turbidity removal 28 further analysis was conducted using flocculation activity to show only the performance of bioflocculant compared with the control 16 55 on the basis of the highest flocculation activity ws5 performed significantly better than any other bioflocculants a high flocculation activity indicates that the eps compounds produced by bacteria contributed to turbidity removal by assisting the cacl2 28 flocculants produced by bacteria commonly have a characteristic of high molecular weight which then perform in the particle bridging process during the turbidity removal 16 56 three significant highest flocculation activities were ws5 49 2 wl2 38 9 and ws7 31 4 showed promising results as comparison bacillus velezensis showed 18 5 16 agrobacterium sp m 503 showed 74 5 b cereus showed 75 and b thuringiensis showed 76 3 of flocculating activity 57 turbidity removal by ws5 reached 69 0 from 5227 580 to 1621 138 ntu wl2 showed 62 7 from 5227 580 to 1949 260 ntu and ws7 exhibited 58 2 from 5227 580 to 2187 257 ntu on the basis of the presented results ws5 was selected to be tested in the next stage further characterisation was conducted for ws5 with detailed results as shown in table 2 and fig 3 indicating that it was rod shaped bacteria as clearly observed under sem analysis 3 3 ovat analysis on initial turbidity concentration on the basis of the previous test result ws5 was tested in ovat for initial turbidity flocculation activity for each treatment using different initial turbidity is illustrated in fig 4 the presented results showed that significant differences were observed for different initial turbidity treated with bioflocculant the bioflocculant showed a low activity 0 on the low turbidity water while showing a good performance with increasing turbidity up to 5000 ntu 45 55 this result suggested that the produced bioflocculant by ws5 is more suitable to be applied in high turbidity water compared with low turbidity water similar to several previous research biocoagulants and bioflocculant showed better capability in removing turbidity from high turbidity water compared with medium or low turbidity water 58 60 this phenomenon is related to the mechanism of the floc formation by most biocoagulants bioflocculants in which particle bridging become more efficient if more dense suspended solids are present 58 60 on the basis of this result 5000 ntu was selected to be the initial turbidity for the next ovat step 3 4 ovat analysis on bioflocculant dose the results of ovat analysis for different bioflocculant doses are depicted in fig 5 from the figure the increasing bioflocculant dose yielded a higher flocculation activity and turbidity removal however no significant difference was observed on the flocculation activity of 5 10 bioflocculant dose these results suggest that the optimum dose of bioflocculant was achieved by using 5 v v of bioflocculant dose with 72 5 flocculation activity the utilisation of higher bioflocculant dose more than 5 did not contribute significantly to the flocculation activity similar to the studies of asrafuzzaman et al gaikwad and munavalli and ramavandi 58 60 the addition of more flocculants did not significantly increase the total removal while even reducing the removal of turbidity from water excess flocculant will not interact with suspended particles thereby creating additional suspended solid that contributes to the increment of turbidity 58 after analysing the flocculation activity the performance of bioflocculant in treating kaolin suspension was confirmed by particle size distribution analysis fig 6 the peak of the particle size shifted to the higher diameter which indicated that floc formation occurred during the treatment 61 the suspension size of formed flocs increased due to the agglomeration of particles facilitated by the coagulant flocculant 62 not only the peak of size shifted but the intensity of the detected particle size also increased the higher particle size intensity of the larger particle size indicated that the process of coagulation and flocculation occurred well which resulted in the particle size changing into a larger floc size 63 the increase of particle size might occur due to the utilisation of coagulant but the flocculant also played an important role in overcoming the electrostatic repulsive forces a larger floc was created by decreasing the restabilisation zone 63 analysis on the effect of bioflocculant addition to the floc formation and size distribution can be conducted in future to enrich the currently presented result compounds such as high molecular weight protein and carbohydrates in bioflocculants acted as polymer aid during the agglomeration process maintaining the electrostatic forces and preventing charge reversal 63 64 3 5 analysis of potential bacteria species after dna extraction gel electrophoresis showed dna quantity of up to 1500 bp which is suitable for further sequencing the result of full sequences obtained from the company was then analysed further to obtain bacterial species blast analysis result showed high percentage of identification similar to the species of serratia marcescens the top five strains of the percent identification using blast are listed in table 3 a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the result of blast as shown in fig 7 on the basis of the result of blast and phylogenetic tree analysis the selected bacteria was identified as s marcescens s marcescens is a gram negative rod shaped bacteria fig 3 that can produce red pigmentation in room temperature 65 66 this bacteria species can also produce biosurfactant while possessing capability in hydrocarbon degradation 67 68 however its capability in producing bioflocculants has not been widely explored yet 3 6 analysis of produced bioflocculant the ft ir reading for the extracted bioflocculant is shown in fig 8 the analysis of chemical functional groups based on the obtained spectra is tabulated in table 4 a functional group is a group of atoms within a molecule that determines the chemical properties and characteristics of chemical reactions and tends to undergo similar reactions from the obtained spectra alcohol was present several times whereas amine was detected two times hydroxyl and amine are amongst the two out of six main functional groups i e hydroxyl sulfhydryl carbonyl carboxyl amino and phosphate that are hydrophilic hydroxyl group may carry a negative or neutral particle whereas the amine group may carry positive or neutral particle depending on its ph 69 this result indicated that the produced bioflocculant was subjected to anionic flocculant in which anion constituted its major compound 3 70 anionic flocculant is considered to be relatively more soluble than cationic flocculant 71 72 amine and alcohol components are present in many flocculants and contribute to hydrophilicity 73 75 ch stretching and cc bonding inside the bioflocculant might be the indication for a long chain of hydrocarbon molecules 76 which may contribute to the high molecular weight of the compound anionic flocculant commonly has high molecular weight long polymer chain and many negatively charged functional groups 3 16 71 the results of zeta potential analysis confirmed that the produced compounds by s marcescens could be categorised as anionic bioflocculant with a zeta potential of 11 87 0 41 mv the obtained bioflocculant charge was negative although considered a moderate negatively charge compared with other bioflocculants produced by bacteria enterobacter sp eth 2 produces bioflocculants with 28 7 8 23 mv charge 77 bacillus amyloliquefaciens dt produces bioflocculants with a zeta potential of 33 67 0 90 mv 78 and bacillus licheniformis shows considerable charges of 48 3 mv 79 anionic flocculants remove turbidity mostly via particle bridging mechanism 80 81 in addition charge neutralisation mechanisms may also occur in positively charged suspension 69 4 conclusions bioflocculant produced by isolated bacteria from aquaculture effluent showed a great potential in removing turbidity from highly turbid water the produced bioflocculant performed better in high turbidity water compared with the low turbidity water as indicated by higher flocculation activity bioflocculant dose of 5 v v at a 2 3 ratio of bioflocculant to cacl2 was the optimum for turbidity removal increasing the bioflocculant dose did not contribute significantly to the flocculation activity the highest flocculation activity of 72 5 along with the decreasing turbidity from 5000 0 to 1040 142 ntu was attained in this study the potential rod shaped bacteria of ws5 confirmed through sem images was identified as s marcescens based on blast and phylogenetic tree analysis results the ft ir spectrum analysis and the value of zeta potential indicated that the produced bioflocculant can be categorised as anionic bioflocculant with particle bridging subjected as the main mechanism in turbidity removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing interest for the submission and publication of this paper

in each variation the control reactors were treated using the same with sterile nutrient broth that substitutes the bioflocculant dose flocculation activity was calculated by following eq 1 and the selection of the best bioflocculant dose was analysed from the optimum flocculation activity the coagulation flocculation performance using bioflocculant assisted with cacl2 from the highest flocculation activity was also confirmed by particle size distribution analysis using zetasizer malvern instrument uk approximately 10 ml of sample was taken from the bottom of the beaker during a jar

was processed further mega x software 52 was used to construct the phylogenetic tree of the selected bacteria bacterial species was determined based on the constructed phylogenetic tree and the result from blast with the highest percent identification similarity 2 10 extraction and analysis of produced bioflocculant eps as bioflocculant was extracted using cold ethanolic extraction method following agunbiade et al and tawila et al 28 53 bioflocculant containing medium and bacteria were separated by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 15 min cell free supernatant was mixed with cold methanol r m

bioflocculant was analysed using fourier transform infrared ft ir to determine its chemical bounding analysis of organic compound was conducted by database comparison 54 following the sigma aldrich ir spectrum database zeta potential was also analysed for the produced bioflocculant to determine the charge of the compound using zetasizer malvern instrument uk a total of 1 mg of bioflocculant was dispersed into 10 ml of distilled water to produce 100 mg l dose of bioflocculant sample the sample was then placed into a clear disposable zeta cell for direct analysis three replications were conducted during analysis to obtain the standard deviation zeta potential charge was depicted under the unit of mv 3 results and discussion 3 1 isolated bacteria from each sampling location the obtained colonies were presented as colony forming unit per millilitre sample cfu ml as depicted in fig 1 on the basis of fig 1 the number of colonies were 6 40 0 02 6 39 00 6 33 0 04 and 5 09 0 13 log cfu ml for sl wl ss and ws samples respectively the number of colonies from the ws sample was significantly lower compared with that of other samples from the samples 21 bacterial colonies were obtained and tabulated as shown in table 1 3 2 screening of flocculation activity and selection of potential bacteria flocculation activities exhibited by each bioflocculant at the screening stage are presented in fig 2 all bacteria showed flocculation activities ranging from 6 9 to 49 2 the control reactor showed turbidity removal of 36 0 whereas the addition of bioflocculant could increase the total removal to 68 0 most of the bioflocculant showed a significant increment in terms of the turbidity removal compared with the control reactor indicating that the bioflocculant showed a good contribution to the turbidity removal 28 further analysis was conducted using flocculation activity to show only the performance of bioflocculant compared with the control 16 55 on the basis of the highest flocculation activity ws5 performed significantly better than any other bioflocculants a high flocculation activity indicates that the eps compounds produced by bacteria contributed to turbidity removal by assisting the cacl2 28 flocculants produced by bacteria commonly have a characteristic of high molecular weight which then perform in the particle bridging process during the turbidity removal 16 56 three significant highest flocculation activities were ws5 49 2 wl2 38 9 and ws7 31 4 showed promising results as comparison bacillus velezensis showed 18 5 16 agrobacterium sp m 503 showed 74 5 b cereus showed 75 and b thuringiensis showed 76 3 of flocculating activity 57 turbidity removal by ws5 reached 69 0 from 5227 580 to 1621 138 ntu wl2 showed 62 7 from 5227 580 to 1949 260 ntu and ws7 exhibited 58 2 from 5227 580 to 2187 257 ntu on the basis of the presented results ws5 was selected to be tested in the next stage further characterisation was conducted for ws5 with detailed results as shown in table 2 and fig 3 indicating that it was rod shaped bacteria as clearly observed under sem analysis 3 3 ovat analysis on initial turbidity concentration on the basis of the previous test result ws5 was tested in ovat for initial turbidity flocculation activity for each treatment using different initial turbidity is illustrated in fig 4 the presented results showed that significant differences were observed for different initial turbidity treated with bioflocculant the bioflocculant showed a low activity 0 on the low turbidity water while showing a good performance with increasing turbidity up to 5000 ntu 45 55 this result suggested that the produced bioflocculant by ws5 is more suitable to be applied in high turbidity water compared with low turbidity water similar to several previous research biocoagulants and bioflocculant showed better capability in removing turbidity from high turbidity water compared with medium or low turbidity water 58 60 this phenomenon is related to the mechanism of the floc formation by most biocoagulants bioflocculants in which particle bridging become more efficient if more dense suspended solids are present 58 60 on the basis of this result 5000 ntu was selected to be the initial turbidity for the next ovat step 3 4 ovat analysis on bioflocculant dose the results of ovat analysis for different bioflocculant doses are depicted in fig 5 from the figure the increasing bioflocculant dose yielded a higher flocculation activity and turbidity removal however no significant difference was observed on the flocculation activity of 5 10 bioflocculant dose these results suggest that the optimum dose of bioflocculant was achieved by using 5 v v of bioflocculant dose with 72 5 flocculation activity the utilisation of higher bioflocculant dose more than 5 did not contribute significantly to the flocculation activity similar to the studies of asrafuzzaman et al gaikwad and munavalli and ramavandi 58 60 the addition of more flocculants did not significantly increase the total removal while even reducing the removal of turbidity from water excess flocculant will not interact with suspended particles thereby creating additional suspended solid that contributes to the increment of turbidity 58 after analysing the flocculation activity the performance of bioflocculant in treating kaolin suspension was confirmed by particle size distribution analysis fig 6 the peak of the particle size shifted to the higher diameter which indicated that floc formation occurred during the treatment 61 the suspension size of formed flocs increased due to the agglomeration of particles facilitated by the coagulant flocculant 62 not only the peak of size shifted but the intensity of the detected particle size also increased the higher particle size intensity of the larger particle size indicated that the process of coagulation and flocculation occurred well which resulted in the particle size changing into a larger floc size 63 the increase of particle size might occur due to the utilisation of coagulant but the flocculant also played an important role in overcoming the electrostatic repulsive forces a larger floc was created by decreasing the restabilisation zone 63 analysis on the effect of bioflocculant addition to the floc formation and size distribution can be conducted in future to enrich the currently presented result compounds such as high molecular weight protein and carbohydrates in bioflocculants acted as polymer aid during the agglomeration process maintaining the electrostatic forces and preventing charge reversal 63 64 3 5 analysis of potential bacteria species after dna extraction gel electrophoresis showed dna quantity of up to 1500 bp which is suitable for further sequencing the result of full sequences obtained from the company was then analysed further to obtain bacterial species blast analysis result showed high percentage of identification similar to the species of serratia marcescens the top five strains of the percent identification using blast are listed in table 3 a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the result of blast as shown in fig 7 on the basis of the result of blast and phylogenetic tree analysis the selected bacteria was identified as s marcescens s marcescens is a gram negative rod shaped bacteria fig 3 that can produce red pigmentation in room temperature 65 66 this bacteria species can also produce biosurfactant while possessing capability in hydrocarbon degradation 67 68 however its capability in producing bioflocculants has not been widely explored yet 3 6 analysis of produced bioflocculant the ft ir reading for the extracted bioflocculant is shown in fig 8 the analysis of chemical functional groups based on the obtained spectra is tabulated in table 4 a functional group is a group of atoms within a molecule that determines the chemical properties and characteristics of chemical reactions and tends to undergo similar reactions from the obtained spectra alcohol was present several times whereas amine was detected two times hydroxyl and amine are amongst the two out of six main functional groups i e hydroxyl sulfhydryl carbonyl carboxyl amino and phosphate that are hydrophilic hydroxyl group may carry a negative or neutral particle whereas the amine group may carry positive or neutral particle depending on its ph 69 this result indicated that the produced bioflocculant was subjected to anionic flocculant in which anion constituted its major compound 3 70 anionic flocculant is considered to be relatively more soluble than cationic flocculant 71 72 amine and alcohol components are present in many flocculants and contribute to hydrophilicity 73 75 ch stretching and cc bonding inside the bioflocculant might be the indication for a long chain of hydrocarbon molecules 76 which may contribute to the high molecular weight of the compound anionic flocculant commonly has high molecular weight long polymer chain and many negatively charged functional groups 3 16 71 the results of zeta potential analysis confirmed that the produced compounds by s marcescens could be categorised as anionic bioflocculant with a zeta potential of 11 87 0 41 mv the obtained bioflocculant charge was negative although considered a moderate negatively charge compared with other bioflocculants produced by bacteria enterobacter sp eth 2 produces bioflocculants with 28 7 8 23 mv charge 77 bacillus amyloliquefaciens dt produces bioflocculants with a zeta potential of 33 67 0 90 mv 78 and bacillus licheniformis shows considerable charges of 48 3 mv 79 anionic flocculants remove turbidity mostly via particle bridging mechanism 80 81 in addition charge neutralisation mechanisms may also occur in positively charged suspension 69 4 conclusions bioflocculant produced by isolated bacteria from aquaculture effluent showed a great potential in removing turbidity from highly turbid water the produced bioflocculant performed better in high turbidity water compared with the low turbidity water as indicated by higher flocculation activity bioflocculant dose of 5 v v at a 2 3 ratio of bioflocculant to cacl2 was the optimum for turbidity removal increasing the bioflocculant dose did not contribute significantly to the flocculation activity the highest flocculation activity of 72 5 along with the decreasing turbidity from 5000 0 to 1040 142 ntu was attained in this study the potential rod shaped bacteria of ws5 confirmed through sem images was identified as s marcescens based on blast and phylogenetic tree analysis results the ft ir spectrum analysis and the value of zeta potential indicated that the produced bioflocculant can be categorised as anionic bioflocculant with particle bridging subjected as the main mechanism in turbidity removal declaration of competing interest the authors declare no competing interest for the submission and publication of this paper

13501,in this study layered double hydroxides ldhs containing m co cu zn and ni and fe were produced and employed for the removal of eriochrome black t ebt dye from different water matrices the characterization results showed that the cufe and cofe ldh exhibited excellent crystallinity and excess surface hydroxyl groups with better textural properties compared to znfe and nife ldh adsorption of ebt onto m fe ldh was found higher in the acidic ph range 2 4 the ebt adsorption process onto m fe ldh followed the pseudo second order kinetic model and isotherm was better described by the redlich peterson r p model the maximum adsorption capacity of cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh was 136 98 250 123 45 123 43 mg g respectively at initial dye concentration of 200 mg l ph 2 5 contact time 120 min and temperature 298 k the mean free energy calculated from d r model was 40 kj mol for cofe and cufe ldh and 40 kj mol for znfe and nife ldh implying that the removal of ebt was achieved by chemisorption and physisorption respectively the adsorption performance of prepared ldhs after three successive regeneration cycles followed the order cufe cofe nife znfe interestingly compared to other ldhs cufe ldh exhibited better physicochemical properties and showed higher adsorption and reusability performance for the removal of ebt dye in the different water matrices this indicated that the cufe ldh could be applied as an effective adsorbent for decontamination of anionic dyes in industrial effluents keywords environmental pollution layered double hydroxides eriochrome black t wastewater treatment regeneration adsorption 1 introduction in recent years rapid industrial development resulted in an enormous volume of wastewater discharge and caused a serious threat to the environment and human health in particular dyes contaminated effluents are highly noxious owing to their strong color chemical oxygen demand and low biodegradable nature 1 2 presence of colored effluents in water bodies directly inhibit the photosynthesis and damage the marine system 3 4 moreover even at a low concentration level their existence in a public supply water system can cause serious problems to humans nearly 8 105 tons of dyes are produced annually about 80 85 of synthetic dyes are consumed in textile dyeing industries and 15 of them are discharged with effluents 5 6 azo dyes are among the most consumed dyes for textile fabrics due to the high color fastness low cost and wide range of colors available in the market 7 eriochrome black t ebt dye which is also called mordant black t is an azo dye that is widely used for the coloring of textile fabrics including silk wool and nylon it is carcinogenic mutagenic and produces chronic devastating effects in the aquatic environment exposure of humans to ebt dye is harmful and may cause severe health issues 8 therefore cost effective treatment of dye containing bodies before releasing them to the environment or reuse for agriculture applications is highly desirable various wastewater treatment methods have been widely investigated for the removal of colored effluents from synthetic and actual polluted water this includes adsorption 9 10 coagulation 11 photodegradation 12 and bioremediation processes 13 14 the adsorption process has attracted tremendous attention to effectively purify dye contaminated water owing to its process simplicity lower process cost and better removal performance 15 16 layered double hydroxides ldhs are hydrotalcite clays with brucite layered structure have shown promising performance in water purification technologies 17 18 the ldh can be expressed by the general formula m 1 x 2 m x 3 o h 2 x a x n n m h 2 o x where m2 and m3 are metals with divalent and trivalent ions x is the molar ratio of trivalent cations an is the anion within the interlayer 19 20 the advantages of using ldhs for wastewater treatment is the versatile composition large specific surface area low toxicity and excellent capability to accommodate a wide range of anions in the interlayers 21 these promising characteristics of ldhs facilitate fast and high removal efficiency for various pollutants compared to other reported adsorbents 22 23 for example chen et al 24 demonstrated an excellent affinity of cofe ldh for direct red dye at a wide ph range of 4 10 with maximum adsorption capacity of 173 3 mg g similarly cufe ldh demonstrated robust and excellent removal of malachite green dye within 30 min 24 bhowmik et al 25 investigated cafe mnfe ldh for removal of ebt and reported maximum adsorption achieved within 15 min yi et al 26 reported high adsorption performance of nife ldh for removal of methyl orange with a maximum adsorption capacity of 205 76 mg g which is higher than that of natural carbohydrate polymeric adsorbents 15 these ldhs exhibited high anionic pollutant removal efficiency and fast sorption rate compared to other investigated adsorbents 27 29 along with high adsorption performance the excellent reusability potential is an extra feature to validate its applicability in treating real wastewater systems however the widespread applications of ldhs is limited due to agglomeration in an aqueous medium which can be improved by surface modification of ldhs 30 therefore researchers are exerting extensive efforts to produce low cost materials exhibiting better dye removal and high reusability performance 27 28 based on a detailed literature review various ldhs have been investigated for the removal of dyes but there is no work performed so far to investigate and compare the dye adsorption performance of ldhs produced from different precursor salts such as ni cu zn or co at similar adsorption and regeneration conditions therefore the main objective of this work is to synthesize ldhs cofe cufe znfe and nife of different mole ratios and evaluate its adsorption and reusability potential for the uptake of ebt dye in different water systems the physicochemical properties of synthesized ldhs were analyzed using various characterization techniques the influential adsorption parameters including ph contact time concentration temperature and ionic strength were investigated in details the ebt interaction mechanism with ldhs surface was demonstrated in the view of isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic studies this was further supported by the characterization of spent ldhs after ebt removal moreover the reusability capability of ldhs for the ebt dye removal was investigated using different regeneration reagents 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and methods the ldh precursor salts such as co ii cu ii zn ii ni ii and fe iii nitrate hexahydrate was purchased from sigma aldrich co usa ethanol hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide was purchased from merch usa all of these chemicals were used as received without any modification a stock solution of 500 mg l of ebt dye was prepared by dissolving 500 mg ebt in 1000 ml of de ionized water and the required ebt concentration was obtained by diluting to de ionized water 2 2 production of layered double hydroxides m co cu ni zn fe ldh the coprecipitation method was used for synthesizing cofe cufe nife and znfe ldhs based on a preliminary study fig s1 supplementary material which includes the synthesis of different mole ratios of m fe ldh for the removal of ebt dye the selected metal precursor salts with the molar ratio of 3 1 cofe 2 1 cufe 3 1 nife and 1 2 znfe were prepared by adding the required amount of metal salts table 1 separately in 100 ml de ionized water under vigorous stirring at 60 c for 15 min the ph of the reaction salt mixture was raised to ph 9 by dropwise addition of 1 0 m naoh solution the reaction solution with vigorous stirring is kept at constant refluxed to 24 h at 65 c afterwards the co precipitated solution is centrifuged and washed several times with de ionized water and finally with pure ethanol to get rid of all unreacted salts the cofe cufe nife and znfe ldhs thus obtained were dried in an oven for 16 h at 85 c 2 3 characterization of m fe ldh characterization of m fe ldh was performed by various techniques that include fourier transform ir ftir nicolet 6700 resolution 4 cm 1 x ray diffraction xrd d8 advance x ray instrument wavelength 0 1542 nm and 2θ 5 to 70 scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem and edx sm 6460lv jeol and brunauer emmett teller bet quantachrome nova 2 4 adsorption experiment of ebt dye batch mode adsorption tests were conducted in a 50 ml plastic vial in a temperature controlled agitator bath firstly the adsorption environmental conditions such as ph 2 8 contact time 0 180 min temperature 298 318 k and ionic strength 0 15 g l nacl were investigated containing 40 ml of the initial ebt dye concentration of 20 and 100 mg l in 50 ml plastic vial the spent ldhs after ebt removal was separated by centrifugation for 5 min at 5000 rpm the final concentration of ebt was determined by the uv vis hach lange spectrophotometer at a maximum wavelength of 530 nm the adsorbed amount of the ebt dye on each ldh qe mg g and percentage removal efficiency of ebt were assessed using eq 1 and 2 respectively 1 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y q e c 0 c e v w 2 p e r c e n t a g e r e m o v a l c 0 c e c e 100 where co and ce mg l initial and

mechanism onto m fe ldh the kinetic study was applied to elaborate on the reaction mechanisms and the actual rate limiting step for the m fe ldh ebt adsorption systems 31 to achieve that the kinetic data at 20 and 100 mg l ebt dye concentration were fitted to the linear forms of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion as listed in table 3 the adsorption mechanism of ebt molecules on the m fe ldh surface can be better illustrated via fitting equilibrium data to the extensively used isotherm models namely langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson r p the estimated parameters of these isotherms and their linear form of equations are presented in table 4 characterization of ebt loaded m fe ldh was performed by ftir xrd sem and equilibrium ph to further support the interaction mechanism of ebt dye onto m fe ldh 2 6 reusability performance of m fe ldh the regeneration of the spent m fe ldh was performed using three different reagents 0 5 m naoh ethanol and a mixture of 0 1 m naoh and 2 g l nacl the adsorption experiment was performed by taking 1 2 w v of m fe ldh and ebt dye 100 mg l solution in a 250 ml conical flask the mixture was agitated for 240 min at 275 rpm and temperature 298 k after adsorption the spent m fe ldh was separated via centrifugation 5000 rpm and 5 min and the final concentration of ebt dye was measured using hach lange spectrophotometer at 530 nm for regeneration 1 2 w v of spent m fe ldh and regenerating solvent was agitated at 240 min 275 rpm and 298 k the regenerated m fe ldh was washed with de ionized water and dried at 80 c for further reuse the adsorption regeneration experiment was repeated for up to four cycles to evaluate the reusability performance of m fe ldh 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of m fe ldh 3 1 1 surface morphology and elemental composition of m fe ldh fig 1 shows the surface morphology and edx image of m fe ldh as seen in the sem image of cofe ldh fig 1a the surface is entire homogenous and smooth with well defined tiny particles of cellular shape the particle sizes are in the range of 15 29 nm similarly the micrograph of cufe ldh fig 1a indicates the formation of uniform nanoparticles of cu and fe hydroxides this demonstrated the highly porous spherical surface structure morphology of particles sizes approximately between 20 25 nm this is in agreement with the crystallite size estimated from the xrd result for both znfe and nife ldh fig 1b the surface morphology consists of a laminated plate like particle distributed randomly and stacked over each other like a house of cards which resulted in the formation of aggregates the typical size of particles is less than 100 nm as generally obtained by the coprecipitation method similar structure morphology has been demonstrated by previous ldhs 26 32 the elemental composition of m fe ldh was estimated by sem edx spectra the m fe ldh edx spectra showed the presence of co cu ni zn and fe elements which indicates the excellent formation of ldh layers by the coprecipitation method table 1 3 1 2 textural properties of m fe ldh the textural characteristics surface area average pore radius and pore volume and pore size distribution of m fe ldh was analyzed using n2 adsorption desorption isotherm and barrett joyner halenda bjh model respectively their results are displayed in fig 2 a b and table 2 as seen in table 2 the specific surface area average pore radius and pore volume of m co cu zn ni fe ldh is found to be 110 28 181 77 172 89 32 16 m2 g 22 51 18 02 17 23 23 98 a and 0 22 0 17 0 16 0 19 cm3 g respectively fig 2a clearly shows that the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of cofe and cufe ldh was a hysteresis loop of type v showing mesopores characteristics whereas znfe and nife isotherms were both type iv which suggest that it consist of both mesopores and micropores fig 2b pore size distribution estimated from bjh model fig 2b shows that the pore radius 15 40 16 30 12 25 15 25 a for cofe cufe znfe and nife with a maximum of 21 56 19 66 21 23 23 62 cm3 g pore volume respectively the pore size distribution results imply that the produced m fe ldh by the coprecipitation method exhibited mesoporous and microporous characteristics 33 3 1 3 surface functionality of m fe ldh the ftir spectra of m fe ldh m co cu zn and ni are displayed in fig 3 a the broad and strong band appeared at nearly 3400 3450 cm 1 associated with stretching vibrations of oh in the upper layers of metal bonded hydroxyl groups cu oh or fe oh and interlayers water molecules 27 34 the weak intensity band at 1630 1639 cm 1 was associated with the hoh bond of water molecules in interlayers of m fe ldh the band of the interlayer anions no3 1 was found at 1370 cm 1 in m fe ldh spectra the vibrational band around 550 598 cm 1 may correspond to mixed metal oxides mmo m o mm co cu zn and ni or fe o in their respective ftir spectra in comparison the cufe ldh spectra showed strong oh stretching band intensity than that of znfe and nife ldh this indicates an excess presence of oh groups in the outer sphere of cufe ldh similarly the higher intensity of no3 in the nife ldh may indicate the presence of more anions in the inner layers of nife ldh the ftir results imply that the synthesized m fe ldh exhibited various functionalities oh no3 and mmo which can serve as active binding sites for the removal of ebt dye from the water 3 29 3 1 4 structure of m fe ldh fig 3b shows the xrd patterns of m fe ldh produced at molar ratio 3 1 2 1 1 2 and 3 1 respectively as shown from xrd of cofe ldh the peaks at 2 theta values of 32 58 36 51 44 31 58 94 and 64 75 are indexed plane of 006 009 015 110 and 113 respectively the characteristic peaks of cofe ldh are similar to the cofe2o4 spinel ferrite structure joint committee on powder diffraction standards card jcpds no 22 1086 for cufe ldh the planes corresponding to 220 311 331 511 422 and 440 at 32 58 35 83 48 80 54 06 58 40 and 61 51 respectively are resembled typical tetragonal and rhombohedral crystal cu fe ldh structure jcpds card no 25 0283 moreover the main diffraction peaks detected at 22 45 34 47 and 60 16 in nife xrd diffraction pattern attributed to indexed planes of 220 331 and 440 of nife ldh jcpds no 10 0325 similarly in znfe xrd patterns the major peak at 35 16 and 61 77 are indexed to 331 and 440 planes the xrd results showed that the cofe and cufe exhibited excellent crystallinity compared to the nife and znfe ldh the average crystallites size of m co cu zn and ni fe ldh considering high intensity diffraction peaks using debye scherrer equation was estimated at about 11 17 28 91 3 11 4 02 nm respectively the results are consistent with the previously reported studies on ldhs 35 36 3 1 5 thermal stability of m fe ldh the thermal behavior of synthesized m fe ldh was shown in fig 3c as observed that the percentage weight loss of m fe ldh significantly increased at a heating temperature from 30 to 800 c overall the total percentage weight loss for cofe cufe znfe and nife was 12 29 29 93 15 44 and 35 16 at temperature 800 c respectively the percentage weight loss of m fe ldh associated with water molecules temperature 100 c was about 5 10 moreover the weight loss of cofe cufe znfe and nife at temperature 200 500 c was 8 66 24 27 8 23 28 68 respectively this corresponds to the dehydroxylation and removal of interlayer anions from the m fe ldh surface 37 interestingly cufe and nife showed higher weight loss indicating the presence of excess surface functional groups and resulted in improved sorption sites for the uptake of dye pollutant 38 a further rise in temperature from 500 800 c showed a negligible reduction in weight loss for cofe nife and znfe but around 3 8 was for cufe this is associated with continuous decarboxylation and decarbonization leads to the formation of mixed metal oxides 39 3 2 effect of environmental conditions 3 2 1 initial ph effect the ph effect of ebt dye solution was investigated from ph range 2 5 8 at 20 and 100 mg l of ebt initial concentration and their results are depicted in fig 4 a b respectively the result shows that the adsorption capacity qe of ebt on all four ldhs increases linearly from ph 5 5 to 2 5 in details at 100 mg l of ebt solution fig 4b the qe improves from 43 86 to 71 50 58 66 134 03 7 49 to 44 05 and 3 78 63 90 mg g for cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh when dye solution ph lowered from 5 5 to 2 5 respectively at ph 5 fig 4 a b the ebt adsorption capacity on cofe and cufe ldh started to decrease gradually and reach to the lowest value of 20 56 and 31 22 mg g at ph 8 and 100 mg l of ebt dye respectively however qe of znfe and nife ldh for ebt dye remained unchanged in the ph from 5 to 8 the ebt dye adsorption behavior by ldhs can be well explained by evaluating the surface charge of ebt dye and ldh at varied ph range in an aqueous solution ebt dye is present in anionic species in the form of so3 similarly for the surface charge of ldh point of zero charge phpzc and final ph after the ebt adsorption was estimated as shown in fig 4c the phpzc of cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh was found to be 6 11 7 35 6 92 and 6 83 respectively this indicates that at solution ph phpzc the ldh surface hydroxyl groups are protonated oh2 and expected to strongly adsorb ebt anionic species so3 via electrostatic attraction 40 therefore at ph value 2 5 the existence of more h ions promote complete protonation of surface hydroxyl groups on the ldh inner and outer layers these positively charged surface hydroxyl groups strongly attracted so3 species of ebt forming hydrogen bonding and leading to high ebt adsorption 41 the possible reaction of ebt species with protonated hydroxyl groups are explained in eq 3 3 at ph 6 ldh oh2 so3 ldh oh ho so2 besides at solution ph 2 5 there was no significant change in ph after ebt adsorption fig 4 a b suggesting electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding facilitated ebt adsorption on all ldh at ph 3 5 the reduction in ebt adsorption is due to a less protonated ldh surface this allowed the release of surface bonded hydroxyl ions oh and nitrate ions no3 from ldh layers and expected to adsorb ebt molecules through the ion exchange process the results are ascribed by an obvious increase in final ph after ebt adsorption at ph value 3 5 the low ebt adsorption efficiency of ldh at ph phpzc is mainly due to negatively charged hydroxyl ions oh on the ldh surface which competed with ebt anionic species via electrostatic repulsion and considerably decreased the sorption performance 3 2 2 adsorption contact time and initial dye concentration effect the effect of contact time 5 360 min on the adsorption capacity of m fe ldh was investigated at ph 2 5 and concentration 20 100 mg l fig 5 a b from the results at all studied concentrations the ebt adsorption capacity increased linearly from 15 30 min with almost 70 90 of ebt removal the fast adsorption of ebt is attributed to the availability of active binding sites oh2 which resulted in strong electrostatic attraction to anionic species of ebt in an aqueous solution in fig 5b at 100 mg l dye concentration there is a slight reduction 1 2 in ebt adsorption capacity by cufe ldh after 60 min contact time this might be associated with the desorption of loosely bonded ebt anions with cufe surface due to the availability of less amount of adsorbent to completely interact with ebt molecules 42 moreover the adsorption rate of ebt dye was found in the order of cufe cofe nife znfe and the equilibrium was achieved at 30 60 75 and 90 min respectively cufe ldh showed robust and high ebt adsorption relative to other studied ldh this indicates that cufe characteristics exhibit better interface capability toward ebt anions associated with the presence of abundant hydroxyl functional groups as confirmed from ftir results and large surface area these improved surface and characteristic textural act as active binding sites for better removal of ebt from the water phase the adsorption of ebt dye by the m fe ldh was further studied at a varied initial concentration 20 200 mg l fig 5c as shown cofe nife and znfe ldh indicated a gradual increase in the ebt adsorption with the increase in initial ebt concentration from 20 to 120 mg l in contrast cufe ldh revealed substantial improvement in the removal of ebt as the initial concentration was increased high ebt dye adsorption with increasing dye concentration was mainly due to the availability of excess ebt anionic species in the solution leading to enhanced mass transfer phenomena towards active binding sites on ldh surfaces at higher ebt concentrations 120 mg l the studied m fe ldh showed an insignificant increase in ebt adsorption which was associated with the saturation of m fe ldh surfaces adsorption sites the maximum adsorption capacity of ebt dye at 200 mg l was found to be 94 83 212 354 86 65 and 85 61 mg g for cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh respectively the adsorption performance of cufe ldh was almost 150 per cent greater than that of other ldh this is mainly the presence of more active sites due to abundant surface functionality oh and mmo excellent crystallinity and higher specific area surface compared to cofe nife and znfe ldh as confirmed by ftir xrd and bet analyses 3 2 3 the concentration of electrolyte ionic strength effect dye bearing industrial effluents contain various types of electrolytes that significantly increase the ionic strength and affected the efficiency of the adsorption process therefore the influence of ionic strength on the adsorption capacity of ebt onto m fe ldh was investigated at nacl concentrations in the range of 0 15 g l and their results are depicted in fig 6 a b the adsorption capacity of the ebt on m fe ldh at all studied dye concentration 20 and 100 mg l showed significant enhancement with the addition of nacl in the solution for instance at 100 mg l of dye solution the ebt adsorption capacity increased from 72 46 171 72 74 68 and 70 95 mg g to 286 16 302 61 301 93 and 291 18 mg onto cofe cufe znfe and nife respectively in the presence of nacl salt at 15 g l an increase in the concentration of electrolytes in dye solution may be expected to increase the intensity of intermolecular forces including van der waals ion dipole and dipole dipole forces this may likely promote dimerization and aggregation of azo dye molecules in solution and tended to facilitate the adsorption onto the ldh surfaces 43 similar behavior was reported by d a giannakoudakis et al 2016 for the removal of reactive black 5 dye at different levels of ionic strength 44 as seen the effect of ionic strength was found more significant at higher dye concentration fig 6b this could be due to the fact presence of a high amount of dye molecules which promoted better dye aggregation and lead to excellent improvement in dye adsorption efficiency 15 3 3 interaction mechanism of ebt dye with m fe ldh in order to fully understand the adsorption mechanism of ebt dye molecules on the m fe ldh surfaces kinetic isotherm thermodynamic and characterization of the spent adsorbent was performed and their results are discussed in the following sections 3 3 1 kinetic modeling three widely used kinetic models in the adsorption process namely pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion were fitted to ebt adsorption data at 20 and 100 mg l of ebt solution the linear plots of pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models are displayed in fig 7 a d respectively as shown in table 3 for all the studied concentrations and ldhs the pseudo second order model successfully demonstrating the higher correlation coefficient r2 0 968 0 997 relative to the pseudo first order r2 0 577 0 981 and the intraparticle diffusion r2 0 594 0 914 this shows that the pseudo second order model suitably described the ebt adsorption on m fe ldh furthermore table 3 shows that the difference between the experimental adsorption capacity and theoretical adsorption capacity estimated from the pseudo second order kinetic linear model was small suggesting that the pseudo second order model was appropriate based on the model hypothesis it can be concluded that the chemisorption is likely dominated in controlling the overall adsorption rate constant 45 this was accredited to the chemical reaction between negatively charged anion species of ebt dye and positively charged hydroxyl groups on the ldh surface 25 intraparticle diffusion plot fig 7c d was further used to identify the dye adsorption behavior at varied contact time as seen in fig 7c the adsorption of the ebt dye molecules onto cofe nife and znfe ldh exhibited multiple steps and followed three main linear stages i fast adsorption first stage 15 30 min was attributed to the surface adsorption and external diffusion of the ebt molecules within ldh surface functionalities through electrostatic attraction and chemical complexation bonding between ebt anions and metallic cations as demonstrated in section 3 1 ii gradual ebt adsorption second stage 30 60 min was mainly governed by the diffusion of ebt molecules from the external surface into the pores of ldh iii equilibrium state plateau third stage 90 360 min achieved due to the saturation of sorption sites of m fe ldh in addition the values of c for all the studied ldh were not equal to zero demonstrating that the intraparticle diffusion involved in the adsorption process but was not the rate limiting step of the entire adsorption reaction interestingly cufe ldh exhibited only two adsorption stages i e fast and equilibrium demonstrating highly feasible adsorbent material for the removal of toxic azo ebt dye from the contaminated water streams 3 3 2 isotherm modeling fig 8 a f indicated the ebt adsorption isotherms langmuir freundlich redlich peterson r p of m fe ldhs at different temperatures 298 318 k their corresponding parameters calculated from linear isotherm model equations are listed in table 4 based on regression coefficient r2 and root mean square rmse redlich peterson r p model better fits the equilibrium data which implies that the ebt adsorption on m fe ldh appropriately described by the r p model moreover in the r p model exponent constant brp is found in the range from 0 3 0 7 suggesting the ldh exhibited a heterogeneous surface involving monolayer and multi layer ebt sorption for the removal of ebt the langmuir adsorption capacity followed the order cufe ldh 250 mg g cofe ldh 136 98 mg g nife ldh 123 45 mg g znfe ldh 123 43 mg g at 318 k interestingly the ebt adsorption performance on the m fe ldh showed increasing adsorption capacity at elevated temperature to further quantify the ebt adsorption behavior on m fe ldh heterogeneous surfaces dubinin radushkevich d r based on gaussian energy distribution was applied the mean free energy e obtained from the d r model table 4 is in the range of 40 50 70 111 28 50 and 35 40 kj mol of cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh respectively based on these results the ebt adsorption onto cofe and cufe ldh mainly involved chemisorption e 40 400 kj mol whereas physisorption e 10 40 kj mol mechanism on znfe and nife ldh 3 3 3 thermodynamic modeling the thermodynamic study was performed from the temperature range 298 318 k at ebt concentration of 20 and 100 mg l thermodynamic parameters including the change in free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs was estimated using the following equations 4 δ g r t ln k d 5 ln k d δ s r δ h r t where r is the universal gas constant and t is adsorption temperature the calculated values of δh⁰ δs⁰ were listed in table 5 according to the results the negative values of δg at all studied conditions temperature and concentration indicated that the adsorption of ebt dye on m fe m co cu zn ni ldh is a spontaneous process moreover with the increase in adsorption temperature the values of δg become more negative table 5 indicating favorable adsorption performance at the elevated temperature this implies that the sorption affinity of ebt molecules onto the surfaces of m fe ldh is directly proportional to adsorption temperatures besides the positive values of enthalpy δh confirm that the ebt adsorption on m fe m co cu zn ni ldh is an endothermic process in details the values of δh for cofe cufe znfe and nife are in range of 31 60 18 42 kj mol 184 59 97 11 kj mol 35 20 2 54 kj mol and 57 98 9 35 kj mol respectively for cufe ldh δh 40 kj mol which indicates that the ebt adsorption is dominated by the chemisorption mechanism however δh 40 kj mol for co zn ni fe ldh attributed to the physical adsorption the positive values of entropy δs show an increase in randomness at the ldh ebt solution interface during the adsorption process this demonstrates that ebt adsorption onto m fe ldh involves an associative mechanism through the formation of multi interactions electrostatic hydrogen bonding metal complexation and anion exchange between adsorbate and adsorbent in addition positive values of entropy δs confirm that the adsorption of ebt resulted in a change in the structure of m fe ldh as confirmed by characterization after adsorption section 3 3 4 3 3 4 characterization of spent m fe co cu zn ni ldh to further evaluate and confirm the interaction mechanism of ebt anions with ldh as demonstrated in modeling studies characterization ftir xrd sem and equilibrium ph of ebt loaded m fe ldh was performed as shown in ftir spectra of m fe loaded ebt fig 9 a the intensity of the adsorption band associated with oh no3 and mmo groups significantly changed after ebt adsorption for instance the wide and strong peak at 3400 3450 cm 1 associated with oh groups in m fe ldh fig 1a almost disappeared in ebt loaded m fe ldh spectrum fig 9a this clearly suggests that the presence of oh groups on the outer sphere of m fe ldh majorly contributed to the removal of ebt anions via electrostatic attraction and chemical interaction similarly peaks correspond to no3 and mmo at around 1370 cm 1 and 550 598 cm 1 respectively fig 1a showed noticeable variation in intensity and wavenumber after ebt adsorption on m fe ldh fig 9a this indicates the possible involvement of interlayer no3 anions exchange and mixed metal oxides complexation mechanism with ebt anions scheme 1 the ftir results corroborate that the functionality of m fe ldh dominantly contributed to the removal of ebt anions from the aqueous phase to further support after ebt adsorption on cufe ldh at 20 mg l of ebt the initial dye ph 2 4 3 05 3 91 and 5 14 changed to 3 14 4 45 5 15 and 5 64 respectively fig 4a the increase in solution ph after adsorption implies the release of anions to solution allowing ebt anions to easily trap within the layers of cufe ldh the xrd spectrum of cufe ldh before and after ebt adsorption was shown in fig 9b it is indicated that the ebt loaded cufe ldh exhibits similar characteristic peaks of xrd of cufe ldh after ebt adsorption the characteristics diffraction peaks of cufe ldh significantly reduced to the lower intensity or almost disappeared this indicates complete adsorption of ebt anions within the layers of cufe ldh leading to coverage of its crystalline structure in addition the surface morphology of cufe ldh fig 1a transformed into a smooth and flat surface after ebt adsorption fig 9c this indicates complete saturation of cufe adsorption sites with ebt molecules therefore it can be stated that the sorption mechanism of ebt dye onto m fe ldh is associated with multi processes physisorption electrostatic surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion and chemisorption hydrogen bonding and chemical complexation scheme 1 3 4 adsorption performance of cufe ldh in different water streams the adsorption performance of ebt dye onto a synthesized cufe ldh was further examined in four different water streams de ionized water tap water tertiary treated water and seawater around 40 mg l of ebt solution was prepared in different water streams and agitated with 0 01 g of cufe ldh in a 50 ml plastic vial at ph 2 5 for 180 min the results are displayed in fig 9d as seen the adsorption capacity of ebt dye onto cufe was higher in de ionized 104 22 mg g and tertiary water 114 61 mg g from the water treatment plant the better removal performance of ebt could be attributed to the presence of anions in treated water which may form complexes with ebt anions and facilitates better interaction with the positively charged surface of cufe ldh this implies that cufe exhibited great potential for effective remediation of dye containing effluents however the adsorption capacity almost reduced to half and one third in seawater 60 41 mg g and tap water 16 81 mg g solutions respectively the presence of a substantial amount of minerals such as magnesium calcium copper and sodium in tap and seawater solution might show the competitive effect with ebt anions and result in low sorption on to cufe surface due to reduced mass transfer phenomena 3 5 reusability performance of m fe m co cu zn ni ldh the reusability performance of adsorbent is an important tool to measure its potential application in industries adsorbents with high reusability efficiency significantly reduce process cost and signified as highly economic feasible the ebt adsorption efficiency by m fe m co cu zn ni ldh up to three regeneration cycles using regeneration solvents naoh methanol and mixture of naoh and nacl are displayed in fig 10 a d respectively it was observed that for all ldh the regeneration performance was higher by 0 5 m naoh relative to methanol and 0 5 m naoh 2 g l nacl this indicates that the reusability of ldh varies with the regeneration reagent better adsorption by using 0 5 m naoh as regenerating solvent is attributed to complete deprotonation of spent ldh surface which allows easy release of ebt anions without deterioration of the m fe ldh functionality similar behavior was demonstrated by munjur et al 15 for the removal of methyl orange from rice and graham flour using ethanol solvent whereas in the case of methanol and naoh nacl solvents the significant decrease in adsorption efficiency might be attributed to the following reasons i ineffective desorption of ebt molecules due to partial deprotonation of ldh surface and ii deterioration of ldh functionality during regeneration 46 similar results were reported by sriram et al 47 desorbing congo red dye from modified mgal ldh using naoh and methanol as shown in fig 10 a d using 0 5 m naoh regeneration solvent the ebt adsorption capacity qe reduced to around 24 6 9 5 32 8 and 50 after 2nd successive regeneration cycle of co cu zn ni fe ldh respectively up to the 3rd regeneration cycle the sorption capacity for ebt onto co cu zn and ni fe ldh remained 39 68 131 12 20 54 and 27 96 mg g respectively for cufe ldh the adsorption efficiency after three reusability runs better than that of other studied ldh however the low reusability performance of nife and znfe could be attributed to i deterioration of surface functionality and structure after regeneration and ii strong chemical interaction between ebt anions and adsorbent surface 48 interestingly the ebt adsorption performance by cufe ldh was greater than 50 after three consecutive regeneration cycles indicating good reusability 3 6 comparison with other adsorbents the adsorption performance of produced m fe ldh in this study was compared with previously reported material investigated for the adsorption of ebt dye from the water phase as shown in table 6 the adsorption performance of m fe ldh was found better relative to many other adsorbents which shows promising characteristics for effective wastewater treatment for instance the adsorption capacity of graphene metal organic framework functionalized mesoporous carbon and ternary ldh showed lower sorption affinity towards the produced m fe ldh in this work moreover compared to all studied ldh cufe ldh showed higher and faster removal of ebt signifying potential material for robust and excellent remediation of dye contaminated water streams 4 conclusion in this study m fe m co cu zn and ni ldh was synthesized through the facile coprecipitation method comparative adsorption and reusability performance of m fe ldh for the removal of hazardous ebt dye from different water bodies was performed characterization of m fe ldh confirmed the presence of abundant surface functionalities oh no3 and mmo better crystallographic structure and textural properties which are highly favorable for dye removal the initial ph of dye solution greatly altered the ebt removal on m fe ldh with optimum removal achieved at lower ph values 2 4 the maximum adsorption capacity of cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh was 94 83 212 35 86 65 and 85 61 mg g respectively was obtained at ph 2 5 initial concentration and temperature 298 k the ebt adsorption were well described by pseudo second order kinetic model and showed fast adsorption rate compared to carbon nanostructure materials and functional nano adsorbents the adsorption data were appropriately fitted to the redlich peterson r p isotherm model with multi layer coverage the mean free energy calculated from the d r model was 40 for cofe and cufe and 40 for znfe and nife ldh suggesting that the ebt adsorption was governed by chemisorption and physisorption mechanisms respectively the adsorption performance of ldhs after three successive regeneration cycles was in order cufe cofe nife znfe compared to co ni and zn fe ldh cufe showed excellent affinity and reused towards ebt dye which is mainly due to excellent crystallinity large surface area and excess oxygen functionalities remarkably cufe ldh presented improved removal of ebt dye in different water systems suggesting that cufe ldh possess great potential for effective decontamination of dye in industrial effluents as well as purification of wastewater to safeguard the environment and human health

13501,in this study layered double hydroxides ldhs containing m co cu zn and ni and fe were produced and employed for the removal of eriochrome black t ebt dye from different water matrices the characterization results showed that the cufe and cofe ldh exhibited excellent crystallinity and excess surface hydroxyl groups with better textural properties compared to znfe and nife ldh adsorption of ebt onto m fe ldh was found higher in the acidic ph range 2 4 the ebt adsorption process onto m fe ldh followed the pseudo second order kinetic model and isotherm was better described by the redlich peterson r p model the maximum adsorption capacity of cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh was 136 98 250 123 45 123 43 mg g respectively at initial dye concentration of 200 mg l ph 2 5 contact time 120 min and temperature 298 k the mean free energy calculated from d r model was 40 kj mol for cofe and cufe ldh and 40 kj mol for znfe and nife ldh implying that the removal of ebt was achieved by chemisorption and physisorption respectively the adsorption performance of prepared ldhs after three successive regeneration cycles followed the order cufe cofe nife znfe interestingly compared to other ldhs cufe ldh exhibited better physicochemical properties and showed higher adsorption and reusability performance for the removal of ebt dye in the different water matrices this indicated that the cufe ldh could be applied as an effective adsorbent for decontamination of anionic dyes in industrial effluents keywords environmental pollution layered double hydroxides eriochrome black t wastewater treatment regeneration adsorption 1 introduction in recent years rapid industrial development resulted in an enormous volume of wastewater discharge and caused a serious threat to the environment and human health in particular dyes contaminated effluents are highly noxious owing to their strong color chemical oxygen demand and low biodegradable nature 1 2 presence of colored effluents in water bodies directly inhibit the photosynthesis and damage the marine system 3 4 moreover even at a low concentration level their existence in a public supply water system can cause serious problems to humans nearly 8 105 tons of dyes are produced annually about 80 85 of synthetic dyes are consumed in textile dyeing industries and 15 of them are discharged with effluents 5 6 azo dyes are among the most consumed dyes for textile fabrics due to the high color fastness low cost and wide range of colors available in the market 7 eriochrome black t ebt dye which is also called mordant black t is an azo dye that is widely used for the coloring of textile fabrics including silk wool and nylon it is carcinogenic mutagenic and produces chronic devastating effects in the aquatic environment exposure of humans to ebt dye is harmful and may cause severe health issues 8 therefore cost effective treatment of dye containing bodies before releasing them to the environment or reuse for agriculture applications is highly desirable various wastewater treatment methods have been widely investigated for the removal of colored effluents from synthetic and actual polluted water this includes adsorption 9 10 coagulation 11 photodegradation 12 and bioremediation processes 13 14 the adsorption process has attracted tremendous attention to effectively purify dye contaminated water owing to its process simplicity lower process cost and better removal performance 15 16 layered double hydroxides ldhs are hydrotalcite clays with brucite layered structure have shown promising performance in water purification technologies 17 18 the ldh can be expressed by the general formula m 1 x 2 m x 3 o h 2 x a x n n m h 2 o x where m2 and m3 are metals with divalent and trivalent ions x is the molar ratio of trivalent cations an is the anion within the interlayer 19 20 the advantages of using ldhs for wastewater treatment is the versatile composition large specific surface area low toxicity and excellent capability to accommodate a wide range of anions in the interlayers 21 these promising characteristics of ldhs facilitate fast and high removal efficiency for various pollutants compared to other reported adsorbents 22 23 for example chen et al 24 demonstrated an excellent affinity of cofe ldh for direct red dye at a wide ph range of 4 10 with maximum adsorption capacity of 173 3 mg g similarly cufe ldh demonstrated robust and excellent removal of malachite green dye within 30 min 24 bhowmik et al 25 investigated cafe mnfe ldh for removal of ebt and reported maximum adsorption achieved within 15 min yi et al 26 reported high adsorption performance of nife ldh for removal of methyl orange with a maximum adsorption capacity of 205 76 mg g which is higher than that of natural carbohydrate polymeric adsorbents 15 these ldhs exhibited high anionic pollutant removal efficiency and fast sorption rate compared to other investigated adsorbents 27 29 along with high adsorption performance the excellent reusability potential is an extra feature to validate its applicability in treating real wastewater systems however the widespread applications of ldhs is limited due to agglomeration in an aqueous medium which can be improved by surface modification of ldhs 30 therefore researchers are exerting extensive efforts to produce low cost materials exhibiting better dye removal and high reusability performance 27 28 based on a detailed literature review various ldhs have been investigated for the removal of dyes but there is no work performed so far to investigate and compare the dye adsorption performance of ldhs produced from different precursor salts such as ni cu zn or co at similar adsorption and regeneration conditions therefore the main objective of this work is to synthesize ldhs cofe cufe znfe and nife of different mole ratios and evaluate its adsorption and reusability potential for the uptake of ebt dye in different water systems the physicochemical properties of synthesized ldhs were analyzed using various characterization techniques the influential adsorption parameters including ph contact time concentration temperature and ionic strength were investigated in details the ebt interaction mechanism with ldhs surface was demonstrated in the view of isotherm kinetic and thermodynamic studies this was further supported by the characterization of spent ldhs after ebt removal moreover the reusability capability of ldhs for the ebt dye removal was investigated using different regeneration reagents 2 experimental section 2 1 materials and methods the ldh precursor salts such as co ii cu ii zn ii ni ii and fe iii nitrate hexahydrate was purchased from sigma aldrich co usa ethanol hydrochloric acid sodium hydroxide was purchased from merch usa all of these chemicals were used as received without any modification a stock solution of 500 mg l of ebt dye was prepared by dissolving 500 mg ebt in 1000 ml of de ionized water and the required ebt concentration was obtained by diluting to de ionized water 2 2 production of layered double hydroxides m co cu ni zn fe ldh the coprecipitation method was used for synthesizing cofe cufe nife and znfe ldhs based on a preliminary study fig s1 supplementary material which includes the synthesis of different mole ratios of m fe ldh for the removal of ebt dye the selected metal precursor salts with the molar ratio of 3 1 cofe 2 1 cufe 3 1 nife and 1 2 znfe were prepared by adding the required amount of metal salts table 1 separately in 100 ml de ionized water under vigorous stirring at 60 c for 15 min the ph of the reaction salt mixture was raised to ph 9 by dropwise addition of 1 0 m naoh solution the reaction solution with vigorous stirring is kept at constant refluxed to 24 h at 65 c afterwards the co precipitated solution is centrifuged and washed several times with de ionized water and finally with pure ethanol to get rid of all unreacted salts the cofe cufe nife and znfe ldhs thus obtained were dried in an oven for 16 h at 85 c 2 3 characterization of m fe ldh characterization of m fe ldh was performed by various techniques that include

data at 20 and 100 mg l ebt dye concentration were fitted to the linear forms of pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion as listed in table 3 the adsorption mechanism of ebt molecules on the m fe ldh surface can be better illustrated via fitting equilibrium data to the extensively used isotherm models namely langmuir freundlich and redlich peterson r p the estimated parameters of these isotherms and their linear form of equations are presented in table 4 characterization of ebt loaded m fe ldh was performed by ftir xrd sem and equilibrium ph to further support the interaction mechanism of ebt dye onto m fe ldh 2 6 reusability performance of m fe ldh the regeneration of the spent m fe ldh was performed using three different reagents 0 5 m naoh ethanol and a mixture of 0 1 m naoh and 2 g l nacl the adsorption experiment was performed by taking 1 2 w v of m fe ldh and ebt dye 100 mg l solution in a 250 ml conical flask the mixture was agitated for 240 min at 275 rpm and temperature 298 k after adsorption the spent m fe ldh was separated via centrifugation 5000 rpm and 5 min and the final concentration of ebt dye was measured using hach lange spectrophotometer at 530 nm for regeneration 1 2 w v of spent m fe ldh and regenerating solvent was agitated at 240 min 275 rpm and 298 k the regenerated m fe ldh was washed with de ionized water and dried at 80 c for further reuse the adsorption regeneration experiment was repeated for up to four cycles to evaluate the reusability performance of m fe ldh 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of m fe ldh 3 1 1 surface morphology and elemental composition of m fe ldh fig 1 shows the surface morphology and edx image of m fe ldh as seen in the sem image of cofe ldh fig 1a the surface is entire homogenous and smooth with well defined tiny particles of cellular shape the particle sizes are in the range of 15 29 nm similarly the micrograph of cufe ldh fig 1a indicates the formation of uniform nanoparticles of cu and fe hydroxides this demonstrated the highly porous spherical surface structure morphology of particles sizes approximately between 20 25 nm this is in agreement with the crystallite size estimated from the xrd result for both znfe and nife ldh fig 1b the surface morphology consists of a laminated plate like particle distributed randomly and stacked over each other like a house of cards which resulted in the formation of aggregates the typical size of particles is less than 100 nm as generally obtained by the coprecipitation method similar structure morphology has been demonstrated by previous ldhs 26 32 the elemental composition of m fe ldh was estimated by sem edx spectra the m fe ldh edx spectra showed the presence of co cu ni zn and fe elements which indicates the excellent formation of ldh layers by the coprecipitation method table 1 3 1 2 textural properties of m fe ldh the textural characteristics surface area average pore radius and pore volume and pore size distribution of m fe ldh was analyzed using n2 adsorption desorption isotherm and barrett joyner halenda bjh model respectively their results are displayed in fig 2 a b and table 2 as seen in table 2 the specific surface area average pore radius and pore volume of m co cu zn ni fe ldh is found to be 110 28 181 77 172 89 32 16 m2 g 22 51 18 02 17 23 23 98 a and 0 22 0 17 0 16 0 19 cm3 g respectively fig 2a clearly shows that the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of cofe and cufe ldh was a hysteresis loop of type v showing mesopores characteristics whereas znfe and nife isotherms were both type iv which suggest that it consist of both mesopores and micropores fig 2b pore size distribution estimated from bjh model fig 2b shows that the pore radius 15 40 16 30 12 25 15 25 a for cofe cufe znfe and nife with a maximum of 21 56 19 66 21 23 23 62 cm3 g pore volume respectively the pore size distribution results imply that the produced m fe ldh by the coprecipitation method exhibited mesoporous and microporous characteristics 33 3 1 3 surface functionality of m fe ldh the ftir spectra of m fe ldh m co cu zn and ni are displayed in fig 3 a the broad and strong band appeared at nearly 3400 3450 cm 1 associated with stretching vibrations of oh in the upper layers of metal bonded hydroxyl groups cu oh or fe oh and interlayers water molecules 27 34 the weak intensity band at 1630 1639 cm 1 was associated with the hoh bond of water molecules in interlayers of m fe ldh the band of the interlayer anions no3 1 was found at 1370 cm 1 in m fe ldh spectra the vibrational band around 550 598 cm 1 may correspond to mixed metal oxides mmo m o mm co cu zn and ni or fe o in their respective ftir spectra in comparison the cufe ldh spectra showed strong oh stretching band intensity than that of znfe and nife ldh this indicates an excess presence of oh groups in the outer sphere of cufe ldh similarly the higher intensity of no3 in the nife ldh may indicate the presence of more anions in the inner layers of nife ldh the ftir results imply that the synthesized m fe ldh exhibited various functionalities oh no3 and mmo which can serve as active binding sites for the removal of ebt dye from the water 3 29 3 1 4 structure of m fe ldh fig 3b shows the xrd patterns of m fe ldh produced at molar ratio 3 1 2 1 1 2 and 3 1 respectively as shown from xrd of cofe ldh the peaks at 2 theta values of 32 58 36 51 44 31 58 94 and 64 75 are indexed plane of 006 009 015 110 and 113 respectively the characteristic peaks of cofe ldh are similar to the cofe2o4 spinel ferrite structure joint committee on powder diffraction standards card jcpds no 22 1086 for cufe ldh the planes corresponding to 220 311 331 511 422 and 440 at 32 58 35 83 48 80 54 06 58 40 and 61 51 respectively are resembled typical tetragonal and rhombohedral crystal cu fe ldh structure jcpds card no 25 0283 moreover the main diffraction peaks detected at 22 45 34 47 and 60 16 in nife xrd diffraction pattern attributed to indexed planes of 220 331 and 440 of nife ldh jcpds no 10 0325 similarly in znfe xrd patterns the major peak at 35 16 and 61 77 are indexed to 331 and 440 planes the xrd results showed that the cofe and cufe exhibited excellent crystallinity compared to the nife and znfe ldh the average crystallites size of m co cu zn and ni fe ldh considering high intensity diffraction peaks using debye scherrer equation was estimated at about 11 17 28 91 3 11 4 02 nm respectively the results are consistent with the previously reported studies on ldhs 35 36 3 1 5 thermal stability of m fe ldh the thermal behavior of synthesized m fe ldh was shown in fig 3c as observed that the percentage weight loss of m fe ldh significantly increased at a heating temperature from 30 to 800 c overall the total percentage weight loss for cofe cufe znfe and nife was 12 29 29 93 15 44 and 35 16 at temperature 800 c respectively the percentage weight loss of m fe ldh associated with water molecules temperature 100 c was about 5 10 moreover the weight loss of cofe cufe znfe and nife at temperature 200 500 c was 8 66 24 27 8 23 28 68 respectively this corresponds to the dehydroxylation and removal of interlayer anions from the m fe ldh surface 37 interestingly cufe and nife showed higher weight loss indicating the presence of excess surface functional groups and resulted in improved sorption sites for the uptake of dye pollutant 38 a further rise in temperature from 500 800 c showed a negligible reduction in weight loss for cofe nife and znfe but around 3 8 was for cufe this is associated with continuous decarboxylation and decarbonization leads to the formation of mixed metal oxides 39 3 2 effect of environmental conditions 3 2 1 initial ph effect the ph effect of ebt dye solution was investigated from ph range 2 5 8 at 20 and 100 mg l of ebt initial concentration and their results are depicted in fig 4 a b respectively the result shows that the adsorption capacity qe of ebt on all four ldhs increases linearly from ph 5 5 to 2 5 in details at 100 mg l of ebt solution fig 4b the qe improves from 43 86 to 71 50 58 66 134 03 7 49 to 44 05 and 3 78 63 90 mg g for cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh when dye solution ph lowered from 5 5 to 2 5 respectively at ph 5 fig 4 a b the ebt adsorption capacity on cofe and cufe ldh started to decrease gradually and reach to the lowest value of 20 56 and 31 22 mg g at ph 8 and 100 mg l of ebt dye respectively however qe of znfe and nife ldh for ebt dye remained unchanged in the ph from 5 to 8 the ebt dye adsorption behavior by ldhs can be well explained by evaluating the surface charge of ebt dye and ldh at varied ph range in an aqueous solution ebt dye is present in anionic species in the form of so3 similarly for the surface charge of ldh point of zero charge phpzc and final ph after the ebt adsorption was estimated as shown in fig 4c the phpzc of cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh was found to be 6 11 7 35 6 92 and 6 83 respectively this indicates that at solution ph phpzc the ldh surface hydroxyl groups are protonated oh2 and expected to strongly adsorb ebt anionic species so3 via electrostatic attraction 40 therefore at ph value 2 5 the existence of more h ions promote complete protonation of surface hydroxyl groups on the ldh inner and outer layers these positively charged surface hydroxyl groups strongly attracted so3 species of ebt forming hydrogen bonding and leading to high ebt adsorption 41 the possible reaction of ebt species with protonated hydroxyl groups are explained in eq 3 3 at ph 6 ldh oh2 so3 ldh oh ho so2 besides at solution ph 2 5 there was no significant change in ph after ebt adsorption fig 4 a b suggesting electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding facilitated ebt adsorption on all ldh at ph 3 5 the reduction in ebt adsorption is due to a less protonated ldh surface this allowed the release of surface bonded hydroxyl ions oh and nitrate ions no3 from ldh layers and expected to adsorb ebt molecules through the ion exchange process the results are ascribed by an obvious increase in final ph after ebt adsorption at ph value 3 5 the low ebt adsorption efficiency of ldh at ph phpzc is mainly due to negatively charged hydroxyl ions oh on the ldh surface which competed with ebt anionic species via electrostatic repulsion and considerably decreased the sorption performance 3 2 2 adsorption contact time and initial dye concentration effect the effect of contact time 5 360 min on the adsorption capacity of m fe ldh was investigated at ph 2 5 and concentration 20 100 mg l fig 5 a b from the results at all studied concentrations the ebt adsorption capacity increased linearly from 15 30 min with almost 70 90 of ebt removal the fast adsorption of ebt is attributed to the availability of active binding sites oh2 which resulted in strong electrostatic attraction to anionic species of ebt in an aqueous solution in fig 5b at 100 mg l dye concentration there is a slight reduction 1 2 in ebt adsorption capacity by cufe ldh after 60 min contact time this might be associated with the desorption of loosely bonded ebt anions with cufe surface due to the availability of less amount of adsorbent to completely interact with ebt molecules 42 moreover the adsorption rate of ebt dye was found in the order of cufe cofe nife znfe and the equilibrium was achieved at 30 60 75 and 90 min respectively cufe ldh showed robust and high ebt adsorption relative to other studied ldh this indicates that cufe characteristics exhibit better interface capability toward ebt anions associated with the presence of abundant hydroxyl functional groups as confirmed from ftir results and large surface area these improved surface and characteristic textural act as active binding sites for better removal of ebt from the water phase the adsorption of ebt dye by the m fe ldh was further studied at a varied initial concentration 20 200 mg l fig 5c as shown cofe nife and znfe ldh indicated a gradual increase in the ebt adsorption with the increase in initial ebt concentration from 20 to 120 mg l in contrast cufe ldh revealed substantial improvement in the removal of ebt as the initial concentration was increased high ebt dye adsorption with increasing dye concentration was mainly due to the availability of excess ebt anionic species in the solution leading to enhanced mass transfer phenomena towards active binding sites on ldh surfaces at higher ebt concentrations 120 mg l the studied m fe ldh showed an insignificant increase in ebt adsorption which was associated with the saturation of m fe ldh surfaces adsorption sites the maximum adsorption capacity of ebt dye at 200 mg l was found to be 94 83 212 354 86 65 and 85 61 mg g for cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh respectively the adsorption performance of cufe ldh was almost 150 per cent greater than that of other ldh this is mainly the presence of more active sites due to abundant surface functionality oh and mmo excellent crystallinity and higher specific area surface compared to cofe nife and znfe ldh as confirmed by ftir xrd and bet analyses 3 2 3 the concentration of electrolyte ionic strength effect dye bearing industrial effluents contain various types of electrolytes that significantly increase the ionic strength and affected the efficiency of the adsorption process therefore the influence of ionic strength on the adsorption capacity of ebt onto m fe ldh was investigated at nacl concentrations in the range of 0 15 g l and their results are depicted in fig 6 a b the adsorption capacity of the ebt on m fe ldh at all studied dye concentration 20 and 100 mg l showed significant enhancement with the addition of nacl in the solution for instance at 100 mg l of dye solution the ebt adsorption capacity increased from 72 46 171 72 74 68 and 70 95 mg g to 286 16 302 61 301 93 and 291 18 mg onto cofe cufe znfe and nife respectively in the presence of nacl salt at 15 g l an increase in the concentration of electrolytes in dye solution may be expected to increase the intensity of intermolecular forces including van der waals ion dipole and dipole dipole forces this may likely promote dimerization and aggregation of azo dye molecules in solution and tended to facilitate the adsorption onto the ldh surfaces 43 similar behavior was reported by d a giannakoudakis et al 2016 for the removal of reactive black 5 dye at different levels of ionic strength 44 as seen the effect of ionic strength was found more significant at higher dye concentration fig 6b this could be due to the fact presence of a high amount of dye molecules which promoted better dye aggregation and lead to excellent improvement in dye adsorption efficiency 15 3 3 interaction mechanism of ebt dye with m fe ldh in order to fully understand the adsorption mechanism of ebt dye molecules on the m fe ldh surfaces kinetic isotherm thermodynamic and characterization of the spent adsorbent was performed and their results are discussed in the following sections 3 3 1 kinetic modeling three widely used kinetic models in the adsorption process namely pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion were fitted to ebt adsorption data at 20 and 100 mg l of ebt solution the linear plots of pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models are displayed in fig 7 a d respectively as shown in table 3 for all the studied concentrations and ldhs the pseudo second order model successfully demonstrating the higher correlation coefficient r2 0 968 0 997 relative to the pseudo first order r2 0 577 0 981 and the intraparticle diffusion r2 0 594 0 914 this shows that the pseudo second order model suitably described the ebt adsorption on m fe ldh furthermore table 3 shows that the difference between the experimental adsorption capacity and theoretical adsorption capacity estimated from the pseudo second order kinetic linear model was small suggesting that the pseudo second order model was appropriate based on the model hypothesis it can be concluded that the chemisorption is likely dominated in controlling the overall adsorption rate constant 45 this was accredited to the chemical reaction between negatively charged anion species of ebt dye and positively charged hydroxyl groups on the ldh surface 25 intraparticle diffusion plot fig 7c d was further used to identify the dye adsorption behavior at varied contact time as seen in fig 7c the adsorption of the ebt dye molecules onto cofe nife and znfe ldh exhibited multiple steps and followed three main linear stages i fast adsorption first stage 15 30 min was attributed to the surface adsorption and external diffusion of the ebt molecules within ldh surface functionalities through electrostatic attraction and chemical complexation bonding between ebt anions and metallic cations as demonstrated in section 3 1 ii gradual ebt adsorption second stage 30 60 min was mainly governed by the diffusion of ebt molecules from the external surface into the pores of ldh iii equilibrium state plateau third stage 90 360 min achieved due to the saturation of sorption sites of m fe ldh in addition the values of c for all the studied ldh were not equal to zero demonstrating that the intraparticle diffusion involved in the adsorption process but was not the rate limiting step of the entire adsorption reaction interestingly cufe ldh exhibited only two adsorption stages i e fast and equilibrium demonstrating highly feasible adsorbent material for the removal of toxic azo ebt dye from the contaminated water streams 3 3 2 isotherm modeling fig 8 a f indicated the ebt adsorption isotherms langmuir freundlich redlich peterson r p of m fe ldhs at different temperatures 298 318 k their corresponding parameters calculated from linear isotherm model equations are listed in table 4 based on regression coefficient r2 and root mean square rmse redlich peterson r p model better fits the equilibrium data which implies that the ebt adsorption on m fe ldh appropriately described by the r p model moreover in the r p model exponent constant brp is found in the range from 0 3 0 7 suggesting the ldh exhibited a heterogeneous surface involving monolayer and multi layer ebt sorption for the removal of ebt the langmuir adsorption capacity followed the order cufe ldh 250 mg g cofe ldh 136 98 mg g nife ldh 123 45 mg g znfe ldh 123 43 mg g at 318 k interestingly the ebt adsorption performance on the m fe ldh showed increasing adsorption capacity at elevated temperature to further quantify the ebt adsorption behavior on m fe ldh heterogeneous surfaces dubinin radushkevich d r based on gaussian energy distribution was applied the mean free energy e obtained from the d r model table 4 is in the range of 40 50 70 111 28 50 and 35 40 kj mol of cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh respectively based on these results the ebt adsorption onto cofe and cufe ldh mainly involved chemisorption e 40 400 kj mol whereas physisorption e 10 40 kj mol mechanism on znfe and nife ldh 3 3 3 thermodynamic modeling the thermodynamic study was performed from the temperature range 298 318 k at ebt concentration of 20 and 100 mg l thermodynamic parameters including the change in free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs was estimated using the following equations 4 δ g r t ln k d 5 ln k d δ s r δ h r t where r is the universal gas constant and t is adsorption temperature the calculated values of δh⁰ δs⁰ were listed in table 5 according to the results the negative values of δg at all studied conditions temperature and concentration indicated that the adsorption of ebt dye on m fe m co cu zn ni ldh is a spontaneous process moreover with the increase in adsorption temperature the values of δg become more negative table 5 indicating favorable adsorption performance at the elevated temperature this implies that the sorption affinity of ebt molecules onto the surfaces of m fe ldh is directly proportional to adsorption temperatures besides the positive values of enthalpy δh confirm that the ebt adsorption on m fe m co cu zn ni ldh is an endothermic process in details the values of δh for cofe cufe znfe and nife are in range of 31 60 18 42 kj mol 184 59 97 11 kj mol 35 20 2 54 kj mol and 57 98 9 35 kj mol respectively for cufe ldh δh 40 kj mol which indicates that the ebt adsorption is dominated by the chemisorption mechanism however δh 40 kj mol for co zn ni fe ldh attributed to the physical adsorption the positive values of entropy δs show an increase in randomness at the ldh ebt solution interface during the adsorption process this demonstrates that ebt adsorption onto m fe ldh involves an associative mechanism through the formation of multi interactions electrostatic hydrogen bonding metal complexation and anion exchange between adsorbate and adsorbent in addition positive values of entropy δs confirm that the adsorption of ebt resulted in a change in the structure of m fe ldh as confirmed by characterization after adsorption section 3 3 4 3 3 4 characterization of spent m fe co cu zn ni ldh to further evaluate and confirm the interaction mechanism of ebt anions with ldh as demonstrated in modeling studies characterization ftir xrd sem and equilibrium ph of ebt loaded m fe ldh was performed as shown in ftir spectra of m fe loaded ebt fig 9 a the intensity of the adsorption band associated with oh no3 and mmo groups significantly changed after ebt adsorption for instance the wide and strong peak at 3400 3450 cm 1 associated with oh groups in m fe ldh fig 1a almost disappeared in ebt loaded m fe ldh spectrum fig 9a this clearly suggests that the presence of oh groups on the outer sphere of m fe ldh majorly contributed to the removal of ebt anions via electrostatic attraction and chemical interaction similarly peaks correspond to no3 and mmo at around 1370 cm 1 and 550 598 cm 1 respectively fig 1a showed noticeable variation in intensity and wavenumber after ebt adsorption on m fe ldh fig 9a this indicates the possible involvement of interlayer no3 anions exchange and mixed metal oxides complexation mechanism with ebt anions scheme 1 the ftir results corroborate that the functionality of m fe ldh dominantly contributed to the removal of ebt anions from the aqueous phase to further support after ebt adsorption on cufe ldh at 20 mg l of ebt the initial dye ph 2 4 3 05 3 91 and 5 14 changed to 3 14 4 45 5 15 and 5 64 respectively fig 4a the increase in solution ph after adsorption implies the release of anions to solution allowing ebt anions to easily trap within the layers of cufe ldh the xrd spectrum of cufe ldh before and after ebt adsorption was shown in fig 9b it is indicated that the ebt loaded cufe ldh exhibits similar characteristic peaks of xrd of cufe ldh after ebt adsorption the characteristics diffraction peaks of cufe ldh significantly reduced to the lower intensity or almost disappeared this indicates complete adsorption of ebt anions within the layers of cufe ldh leading to coverage of its crystalline structure in addition the surface morphology of cufe ldh fig 1a transformed into a smooth and flat surface after ebt adsorption fig 9c this indicates complete saturation of cufe adsorption sites with ebt molecules therefore it can be stated that the sorption mechanism of ebt dye onto m fe ldh is associated with multi processes physisorption electrostatic surface adsorption and intraparticle diffusion and chemisorption hydrogen bonding and chemical complexation scheme 1 3 4 adsorption performance of cufe ldh in different water streams the adsorption performance of ebt dye onto a synthesized cufe ldh was further examined in four different water streams de ionized water tap water tertiary treated water and seawater around 40 mg l of ebt solution was prepared in different water streams and agitated with 0 01 g of cufe ldh in a 50 ml plastic vial at ph 2 5 for 180 min the results are displayed in fig 9d as seen the adsorption capacity of ebt dye onto cufe was higher in de ionized 104 22 mg g and tertiary water 114 61 mg g from the water treatment plant the better removal performance of ebt could be attributed to the presence of anions in treated water which may form complexes with ebt anions and facilitates better interaction with the positively charged surface of cufe ldh this implies that cufe exhibited great potential for effective remediation of dye containing effluents however the adsorption capacity almost reduced to half and one third in seawater 60 41 mg g and tap water 16 81 mg g solutions respectively the presence of a substantial amount of minerals such as magnesium calcium copper and sodium in tap and seawater solution might show the competitive effect with ebt anions and result in low sorption on to cufe surface due to reduced mass transfer phenomena 3 5 reusability performance of m fe m co cu zn ni ldh the reusability performance of adsorbent is an important tool to measure its potential application in industries adsorbents with high reusability efficiency significantly reduce process cost and signified as highly economic feasible the ebt adsorption efficiency by m fe m co cu zn ni ldh up to three regeneration cycles using regeneration solvents naoh methanol and mixture of naoh and nacl are displayed in fig 10 a d respectively it was observed that for all ldh the regeneration performance was higher by 0 5 m naoh relative to methanol and 0 5 m naoh 2 g l nacl this indicates that the reusability of ldh varies with the regeneration reagent better adsorption by using 0 5 m naoh as regenerating solvent is attributed to complete deprotonation of spent ldh surface which allows easy release of ebt anions without deterioration of the m fe ldh functionality similar behavior was demonstrated by munjur et al 15 for the removal of methyl orange from rice and graham flour using ethanol solvent whereas in the case of methanol and naoh nacl solvents the significant decrease in adsorption efficiency might be attributed to the following reasons i ineffective desorption of ebt molecules due to partial deprotonation of ldh surface and ii deterioration of ldh functionality during regeneration 46 similar results were reported by sriram et al 47 desorbing congo red dye from modified mgal ldh using naoh and methanol as shown in fig 10 a d using 0 5 m naoh regeneration solvent the ebt adsorption capacity qe reduced to around 24 6 9 5 32 8 and 50 after 2nd successive regeneration cycle of co cu zn ni fe ldh respectively up to the 3rd regeneration cycle the sorption capacity for ebt onto co cu zn and ni fe ldh remained 39 68 131 12 20 54 and 27 96 mg g respectively for cufe ldh the adsorption efficiency after three reusability runs better than that of other studied ldh however the low reusability performance of nife and znfe could be attributed to i deterioration of surface functionality and structure after regeneration and ii strong chemical interaction between ebt anions and adsorbent surface 48 interestingly the ebt adsorption performance by cufe ldh was greater than 50 after three consecutive regeneration cycles indicating good reusability 3 6 comparison with other adsorbents the adsorption performance of produced m fe ldh in this study was compared with previously reported material investigated for the adsorption of ebt dye from the water phase as shown in table 6 the adsorption performance of m fe ldh was found better relative to many other adsorbents which shows promising characteristics for effective wastewater treatment for instance the adsorption capacity of graphene metal organic framework functionalized mesoporous carbon and ternary ldh showed lower sorption affinity towards the produced m fe ldh in this work moreover compared to all studied ldh cufe ldh showed higher and faster removal of ebt signifying potential material for robust and excellent remediation of dye contaminated water streams 4 conclusion in this study m fe m co cu zn and ni ldh was synthesized through the facile coprecipitation method comparative adsorption and reusability performance of m fe ldh for the removal of hazardous ebt dye from different water bodies was performed characterization of m fe ldh confirmed the presence of abundant surface functionalities oh no3 and mmo better crystallographic structure and textural properties which are highly favorable for dye removal the initial ph of dye solution greatly altered the ebt removal on m fe ldh with optimum removal achieved at lower ph values 2 4 the maximum adsorption capacity of cofe cufe znfe and nife ldh was 94 83 212 35 86 65 and 85 61 mg g respectively was obtained at ph 2 5 initial concentration and temperature 298 k the ebt adsorption were well described by pseudo second order kinetic model and showed fast adsorption rate compared to carbon nanostructure materials and functional nano adsorbents the adsorption data were appropriately fitted to the redlich peterson r p isotherm model with multi layer coverage the mean free energy calculated from the d r model was 40 for cofe and cufe and 40 for znfe and nife ldh suggesting that the ebt adsorption was governed by chemisorption and physisorption mechanisms respectively the adsorption performance of ldhs after three successive regeneration cycles was in order cufe cofe nife znfe compared to co ni and zn fe ldh cufe showed excellent affinity and reused towards ebt dye which is mainly due to excellent crystallinity large surface area and excess oxygen functionalities remarkably cufe ldh presented improved removal of ebt dye in different water systems suggesting that cufe ldh possess great potential for effective decontamination of dye in industrial effluents as well as purification of wastewater to safeguard the environment and human health

introduction nowadays the industries have developed rapidly resulting in economic prosperity however this industrial development has led to a major affair threatening humanity which is water pollution 1 3 rapid industrial development has led to an increased demand for oil as one of the world s largest and most rapidly developing countries china accounts for a large proportion of the global demand for petroleum and the development of petrochemicals will affect china s socio economic development therefore china is trying to find feasible and effective ways to increase the rate of oil extraction to cope with resource shortages 4 nevertheless petroleum extraction and refining processes inevitably produce large amounts of oily wastewater the increased quantities of waste produced worldwide in the past decade have highlighted the environmental impact of oil produced water and become an important issue of environmental concern 5 oily wastewater generates a diverse of pollutants that have risky environmental impacts owing to their toxicity carcinogenic and mutagenic properties 6 conventional methods for treating oily wastewater include flotation coagulation biological treatment and membrane separation technology which have several disadvantages such as high operational costs recontamination problems dealing with difficult to treat scum and poor equipment corrosion resistance 7 furthermore biological treatment methods have proven largely ineffective because the activity of microorganisms in traditional biological treatments is limited under high temperature conditions and in the presence of the salts and corrosive chemicals in petroleum wastewater 8 9 these limitations have prompted researchers to develop new strategies for oilfield wastewater treatment 10 recently electrochemical oxidation has emerged as a very effective organic wastewater treatment method owing to various advantages including thorough degradation of organic matter no secondary pollution simple equipment and efficient cleaning 11 12 in particular electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaop can significantly reduce or completely bypass the need for chemical reagents because these

technologies include anodic oxidation ao electro fenton ef photoelectric fenton pef and solar photoelectric fenton spef technologies in addition to electrochemical flocculation electrochemical peroxidation ultrasonic electric fenton and other technologies anodic oxidation is a technique in which organic pollutants are oxidized directly on the anode surface by electron transfer or degraded via the oxidation of oh h2o2 o3 active chlorine species or peroxynitrite produced on the anode surface the production of highly oxidizing active chlorine species involves the generation of cl2 from chloride ions 16 in the water during electrochemical treatment eq 1 after the chlorine diffuses from the anode it is hydrolyzed into hclo and clo eq 2 in addition eq 3 shows that there is an acid base equilibrium between hclo and clo ions with a pka 7 55 1 cl cl2 2e 2 cl2 h2o hclo cl h 3 hclo clo h as the current intensity increases eq 2 is accelerated thus increasing the production of active chlorine 17 the superior performance of ferrate ⅵ feo4 2 as an oxidant disinfectant and coagulant has been demonstrated in several reports 18 23 in addition to its powerful oxidizing capabilities it is also considered an environmentally friendly or green disinfectant common approaches for synthesizing ferrates ⅵ include wet oxidation electrochemical oxidation or high temperature oxidation the wet oxidation method employs hypochlorite to oxidize a ferric salt to form sodium ferrate ⅵ at high concentrations of naoh then koh is added to the sodium ferrate ⅵ solution to precipitate potassium ferrate ⅵ crystals this is a complex process but it leads to high yields and purity luo et al 24 used ozone instead of hypochlorite to prepare ferrate ⅵ which is convenient and rapid method but produces low yields the electrochemical oxidation method requires high costs but involves a relatively clean procedure using elemental iron or an iron compound as the electrode and performing electro oxidation in 14 mm naoh solution to prepare ferrate ⅵ in the high temperature oxidation method iron oxide and potassium nitrate are mixed and heated to 1100 at which point they calcinate to form potassium ferrate ⅵ however this method has the disadvantages of low purity and high energy consumption to our knowledge this report describes the first study regarding the combination of treatment of oilfield wastewater by anodic oxidation and ferrate ⅵ synthesis the oilfield wastewater was taken from liaohe oilfield and its main pollutants are benzene and derivatives naphthalene alkane the ph of the wastewater is 6 5 oil content 4 6 mg l 1 benzene content 24 7 mg l 1 alkane content 4 1 mg l 1 since the treatment of organic wastewater using electrochemical methods can be limited under high toc conditions a flotation flocculation process is required to remove oil and aluminum salts to reduce toc from 800 to 1100 mg l 1 to 200 300 mg l 1 this process is advantageous because it requires a relatively short electrolysis time and produces active chlorine under low current density conditions additionally this approach is greener and more cost effective than traditional ferrate ⅵ synthetic methods and implements a waste recycling method the entire process discussed herein is carried out under strongly alkaline conditions 2 material and methods 2 1 materials active wastewater sample from

active chlorine via anodic oxidation a given wastewater sample 200 ml toc 220 mg l 1 was added to the electrolytic cell and its total organic carbon toc value mg l 1 was recorded as toc0 the electrolytic cell contained an electrochemical system composed of a ti ru ir oxide coated anode surface area 30 cm2 and a graphite cathode surface area 10 cm2 wrapped in asbestos cloth and filter cloth with a pitch of 7 cm a sodium chloride solution various concentrations optimal concentration 10 g l 1 was added to the electrolytic cell and the active chlorine concentration at this time was recorded as cl0 next the constant current electrolysis began with an applied current density of 1 a aliquots were obtained at regular intervals to determine the active chlorine concentrations and toc values over time which were recorded as cln and tocn the active chlorine concentration was quantitatively determined using iodimetry and the toc in the solution was determined using a toc ⅱ analyzer the electrolysis was stopped after 1 h and the toc was measured and recorded the toc removal was calculated using eq 4 4 toc removal toc0 tocn toc0 100 where toc0 and tocn represent the total organic

the reaction was stirred with a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm for 10 min and then at rest aliquots were obtained at regular intervals to determine the toc values and concentration of ferrate ⅵ over time the concentration of ferrate ⅵ was determined by a direct colorimetric method 23 after 3 h of reaction the solution was filtered and the precipitate was characterized by uv vis spectroscopy next kcl was added to the solution and potassium ferrate ⅵ was crystallized by slow evaporation at low temperature between 1 and 0 the product was dried in air and characterized by fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy and x ray diffraction xrd 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of oilfield wastewater by anodic oxidation to evaluate the effect of sodium chloride on the degradation of petroleum wastewater different amounts of sodium chloride were added into the reaction system the initial concentration of sodium chloride was between 5 and 20 g l 1 the relationship between sodium chloride dosage and active chlorine content is shown in fig 1 a and the relationship between sodium chloride dosage and toc removal rate is shown in fig 1 b fig 1 a indicates that as expected the amount of active chlorine i e the concentration of strong oxidants in solution is positively correlated with the sodium chloride dosage of sodium chloride as the dosage of sodium chloride increased the initial rate of active chlorine generation increased and the release potential of chlorine decreased thereby increasing the degree of indirect oxidation reaction fig 1 b shows that the toc removal in oilfield wastewater increases with the electrolysis time of sodium chloride the oxidation mechanism is described by eqs 5 10 as follows the electrochemical degradation process takes place over several reaction steps first there is direct electron transfer at the electrode surface as shown in eq 5 where r represents the organic group o is the oxidation product and n represents an amount number of moles 5 r o ne then hydroxyl radicals are electrogenerated from water molecules discharged in the region close to the electrode surface s anode as illustrated by eqs 6 7 6 s h2o s oh h e 7 s oh r s co2 h2o the nacl in the electrolyte participates in the direct oxidation at the anode and generates various active chlorine species such as chlorine gas cl2 hypochloric acid hclo and hypochlorite clo 25 which further degrade the organic pollutants present in the suspension these processes are described by eqs 8 11 8 2cl cl2 2e 9 cl2 h2o hocl h cl 10 hocl h ocl 11 r ocl co2 h2o cl however fig 1 b also shows that a higher nacl dosing does not necessarily lead to a significant increase in toc removal this is because during petroleum wastewater degradation the direct oxidation at the anode plays a major role whereas the indirect oxidation by active chlorine plays a minor role furthermore in subsequent experiments it was determined that ferrate ⅵ could not be synthesized in the system when the nacl concentration was 5 g l 1 therefore to save costs and ensure that ferrate ⅵ can be synthesized in subsequent experiment the dosage of sodium chloride was chosen to be 10 g l 1 fig 1 a also shows that after 50 min of electrolysis the amount of active chlorine produced does not change significantly at this time it can be considered that the active chlorine content in the solution has reached a maximum and the content of active chlorine was positively correlated with the production of ferrate ⅵ to maximize the concentration of ferrate while synthesizing ferrate ⅵ in the subsequent processes the optimal electrolysis time was determined to be 50 min under these conditions the toc in the oilfield wastewater was reduced from 220 mg l 1 to 119 3 mg l 1 corresponding to 45 8 toc removal 3 2 synthesis of ferrate ⅵ and further degradation of oilfield wastewater by fe oh 3 to evaluate the effect of sodium hydroxide on ferrate ⅵ production different amounts of sodium hydroxide were added into the reaction system the initial concentration of sodium hydroxide was 5 to 20 g l 1 the relationship between the amount of sodium hydroxide and the resulting ferrate ⅵ concentration is shown in fig 2 as illustrated in fig 2 the amount of ferrate ⅵ produced increases as the amount of added naoh increases this is because under strong alkaline conditions active chlorine species mainly exist in the form of clo and the system will react as shown in eqs 12 13 12 fe oh 3 3 clo 4 oh 2 feo4 2 3 cl 5 h2o 13 feo4 2 10 h2o 4 fe oh 3 8 oh 3 o2 as more oh is introduced which promotes the formation of the ferrate ⅵ shown in eq 12 and inhibits the hydrolysis of the ferrate ⅵ shown in eq 13 increasing amounts of feo4 2 are produced this is why the ferrate ⅵ concentration at the dosage of 20 g l 1 was higher than that at other dosages after the reaction was approximately 4 h when the formation and decomposition rates of feo4 2 are equal the system reaches equilibrium and the concentration of feo4 2 reaches a maximum when the naoh concentration was 5 g l 1 ferrate ⅵ was not produced in the system because of the low alkalinity the synthesis of ferrate ⅵ is a solid liquid heterogeneous reaction in which fe no3 3 added to the system first forms fe oh 3 colloids which are then oxidized to ferrate ⅵ by clo therefore when the amount of naoh is small the initial synthesis rate of ferrate ⅵ during the stationary reaction is fast and can reach the maximum concentration in a relatively short time as fig 2 shows the reaction time also affects the formation of ferrate ⅵ when the naoh dosage was 10 g l 1 and the reaction time was 3 h the concentration of ferrate ⅵ reached a maximum when the naoh dosage was 15 or 20 g l 1 the ferrate ⅵ concentration reached a maximum after 6 h of reaction therefore to save costs and reaction time the optimal dosage of naoh was determined to be 10 g l 1 to determine the effect of ferric nitrate dosage on the production of ferrate ⅵ different amounts of ferric nitrate were added into the reaction system the initial concentration of ferric nitrate ranged from 5 to 20 g l 1 the relationship between the amount of ferric nitrate and the concentration of ferrate ⅵ produced is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 when the dosage of ferric nitrate was 10 g l 1 further increasing the dosage of ferric nitrate has no appreciable effect on the amount of ferrate ⅵ produced when the dosage of ferric nitrate was 5 g l the amount of ferrate ⅵ produced was significantly lower therefore to save chemicals reduce costs and obtain higher concentrations of ferrate ⅵ the optimal dosage of ferric nitrate was determined to be 10 g l under the optimal dosage conditions nacl 10 g l 1 naoh 10 g l 1 fe no3 3 10 g l 1 the synthesized ferrate vi concentration was 1 08 mmol l 1 in addition the ferric hydroxide colloid produced in the system enhanced the degradation of organic pollutants in the wastewater because it is a flocculant that removes some of the organic pollutants from the wastewater by adsorption the time at which the electrolysis ends marks the start of the stage where ferric hydroxide is active and the toc in the wastewater at the end of the electrolysis is the initial toc concentration of this stage the toc removal by ferric hydroxide following the electrolysis is shown in fig 4 after 30 min of reaction 89 4 of the toc in the oilfield wastewater was removed causing the toc to drop to 23 3 mg l 1 which is within the emission requirements 3 3 qualitative characterization of ferrate vi synthesized in the system to determine the type of ferrate ⅵ synthesized in the system the precipitate was filtered off and the remaining solution was characterized by uv vis spectroscopy fig 5 the isolated solid was crystallized after adding kcl and characterized by ft ir and xrd figs 6 and 7 respectively fig 5 shows the uv vis spectrum of the solution after filtering off the precipitate the wavelength of maximum absorption was 504 nm which falls within the range of reported characteristic wavelengths 503 508 nm corresponding to ferrate vi 26 the ir absorption of the potassium ferrate is ascribed to the stretching frequency of the four equivalent symmetric tetrahedrally distributed oxygen atoms around the iron 27 two specific peaks in the infrared absorption spectrum of ferrate vi at wave number 324 and 800 cm 1 can be used to identify the presence of potassium ferrate 28 the infrared spectrum of the crystalline product shown in fig 6 contains strong peaks at 809 4 and 1361 5 cm 1 the former are attributed to the stretching frequencies of four equivalent symmetric fe o bonds 29 and the latter is caused by an impurity which likely originated from nitrate however due to the limitation of the experimental instrument the absorption peaks below the wavelength of 500 cm 1 could not appear analysis of this spectrum reveals that the product does contain potassium ferrate ⅵ but it is not highly pure fig 7 presents the x ray diffraction pattern of the solid material after crystallization the strongest diffraction peak appears at 2θ 30 06 which is characteristic of potassium ferrate ⅵ 30 various other characteristic diffraction peaks are also present 2θ 20 68 45 34 58 66 this diffraction pattern is generally consistent with the

13502,this report describes an electrochemical method that encompasses the formation of active chlorine species and the synthesis of ferrate ⅵ this process applies anodic oxidation to degrade oilfield wastewater pollutants while simultaneously generating active chlorine from nacl in the electrolyte ferrate ⅵ is produced by utilizing the oxidizing properties of the active chlorine species in the presence of ferric ions which are added after the electrolysis the advantages of this method include i the relatively short electrolysis time required ii the use of low current density conditions to produce active chlorine substances and iii the formation of ferric hydroxide colloids which can enhance the degradation of petroleum wastewater the residual active chlorine in the system is used to synthesize ferrate ⅵ which can help recycle waste specifically the system achieves 89 4 toc reduction after 50 min of electrolysis with a current intensity of 1 a under the optimal dosage conditions naoh 10 g l 1 fe no3 3 10 g l 1 the concentration of ferrate ⅵ produced after three hours of reaction is 1 08 mmol l 1 the strategy described in this article demonstrates high efficiency towards removing organic pollutants in oilfield wastewater and provides a waste resource recycling strategy keywords anodic oxidation active chlorine ferrate ⅵ resource recycling oilfield wastewater 1 introduction nowadays the industries have developed rapidly resulting in economic prosperity however this industrial development has led to a major affair threatening humanity which is water pollution 1 3 rapid industrial development has led to an increased demand for oil as one of the world s largest and most rapidly developing countries china accounts for a large proportion of the global demand for petroleum and the development of petrochemicals will affect china s socio economic development therefore china is trying to find feasible and effective ways to increase the rate of oil extraction to cope with resource shortages 4 nevertheless petroleum extraction and refining processes inevitably produce large amounts of oily wastewater the increased quantities of waste produced worldwide in the past decade have highlighted the environmental impact of oil produced water and become an important issue of environmental concern 5 oily wastewater generates a diverse of pollutants that have risky environmental impacts owing to their toxicity carcinogenic and mutagenic properties 6 conventional methods for treating oily wastewater include flotation coagulation biological treatment and membrane separation technology which have several disadvantages such as high operational costs recontamination problems dealing with difficult to treat scum and poor equipment corrosion resistance 7 furthermore biological treatment methods have proven largely ineffective because the activity of microorganisms in traditional biological treatments is limited under high temperature conditions and in the presence of the salts and corrosive chemicals in petroleum wastewater 8 9 these limitations have prompted researchers to develop new strategies for oilfield wastewater treatment 10 recently electrochemical oxidation has emerged as a very effective organic wastewater treatment method owing to various advantages including thorough degradation of organic matter no secondary pollution simple

the persistence of the covid 19 pandemic although the necessary guidelines and legislation for wastewater treatment are available efficient removal of ecs from hww requires the applications of advanced treatment technologies this paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing healthcare structures ecs pathways to the environment management practices and effective treatment options for removing ecs from hww a critical evaluation of the current research advances knowledge gaps and directions for future research is also presented keywords hospital wastewater water treatment emerging contaminants environment membranes 1 introduction the provision of healthcare services requires the use of chemical substances to guarantee proper diagnosis treatment disinfection and patient recovery 1 these substances are classified into pharmaceutically active compounds phacs required for healthcare procedures e g investigations surgery medications and imaging and chemicals for controlling nosocomial infections e g disinfectants 2 3 these chemical compounds both in their raw forms or as metabolites or conjugates are excreted from the bodies of patients through their urine and feces and are often washed into sewage systems 4 the emerging contaminants ecs detected in trace concentrations ranging from μg l to ng l can escape wastewater treatment plants wwtps and thereby lead to environmental contamination 4 6 healthcare facilities account for approximately 20 25 of medicine usage among humans with some hospitals using tons of medicines annually 7 8 hospital effluents have been reported to contain tens to several hundreds of micrograms per litre concentrations of antibiotics cytostatic and other drugs 9 10 in some low flow sewer networks hospital effluents account for 80 of all pharmaceuticals and personal care products pcps in the network load 7 hospital wastewaters hww are considered major contributors to ecs 11 12 other routes for ecs entering into hww include the direct disposal of unused or expired drugs landfill leachates and application of sewage sludge to ensure soil fertility 13 many studies have reported that hospitals release untreated or inappropriately treated waste that contains pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics and resistant genes into ambient aquatic environments 7 14 15 the existence of these pharmaceuticals in various environmental matrices including surface water groundwater soil and sediments can threaten human health biota and the environment 16 17 therefore it is critical to properly treat the hospital effluents to minimize their adverse impacts on the environment 18 table 1 highlights the typical characteristics of hww while several countries have adopted regulations for ecs wwtps are neither particularly designed for treating emissions nor have any standards and guidelines for treating micropollutants for instance the european parliament through directive 2008 105 ec has regulated environmental quality standards for a very small number of emerging micropollutants i e bisphenol a diiron and nonylphenol 19 similarly nonylphenol ethoxylates and nonylphenol have been recognized as toxic substances by the government of canada 20 21 other hww micropollutants including phacs pcps and steroid hormones are still excluded from the list of regulated substances further research is required to investigate the effect of these contaminants on public and ecological health and to establish regulatory standards for micropollutants 22 the existence of micropollutants in the environmental matrices pose challenges to public health and environmental sustainability therefore it is important to improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment facilities for the management of discharged effluents 16 wwtps play a vital role in reducing the levels of ecs in reclaimed water however in the majority of the cases these contaminants are not sufficiently removed in wastewater treatment processes and persist in the treated wastewater effluents thereby resulting in their presence in aquatic environments after discharge 4 7 23 24 several studies show that advanced treatment technologies should be installed to reduce the genotoxicity of hww 25 26 the public health risks resulting from these contaminants can be managed in several ways such as by removing pathogenic microorganisms and other chemical contaminants from wastewater and minimizing the exposure of humans to wastewater 22 pharmaceuticals can be removed at the source by implementing technical measures in hospitals or by collecting separate waste streams all of these options can substantially reduce the load of micropollutants previous studies on the presence of ecs in various water environments have not been thoroughly reviewed to provide a comprehensive summary of the presence occurrence of ecs in hospital effluents moreover the removal efficiency of ecs in wwtps treating the hww has been rarely investigated accordingly this review aims to address the following inter connected aspects reported in the literature 1 occurrence of ecs in hww 2 sources and pathways of ecs in hospital effluents 3 management practices 4 ecs treatment options and 5 knowledge gaps and future research directions this review will provide relevant information that can guide decision makers and environmental scientists in their future policies and research endeavours 2 water demand and consumption in healthcare facilities hospitals require large amounts of water every day for various purposes and services however each hospital has a different daily water consumption rate 35 the quantity of wastewater produced by hospitals also depends on several factors including their number of beds water supply availability of general services i e laundry kitchen and air conditioning types and number of wards or units and management policies 36 fig 1 shows the percentage of water consumption of various healthcare services in hospitals 37 in addition the water demand typically observed in hospitals is estimated to range from 200 l to 1200 l bed 1 day 1 38 39 the consumption of water in a hospital environment is accompanied by an equal amount of wastewater discharge hospital effluents also contain domestic discharge coming from kitchens laundries and toilets the water demand for various healthcare facilities is presented in table 2 7 40 3 sources and transport of ecs in hospital effluents hospitals generate a large amount of wastewater that contain different varieties of pollutants 4 7 41 hww consists of ecs and pathogens that are excreted from human bodies through urine and feces and often end up in sewer systems which remain the major path for these contaminants to enter municipal sewage systems fig 2 4 42 44 consumer products such as soaps disinfectants and shampoos are other sources of ecs 45 the ecs released from these products are transported to wwtps to undergo a treatment process however not all wwtps are capable of removing all types of ecs discharged by hospitals therefore they routinely help ecs to enter the natural environment 46 the presence of these ecs in the environment can threaten both public health and the ecosystem given the unique physicochemical properties i e polarity water solubility microbial resistance and persistence of ecs in hww these bioactive chemicals may also bioaccumulate in the food chain 4 humans are particularly exposed to drinking water that is produced from surface water 47 moreover after treating these contaminants the sludge is applied to the soil as fertilizer whereas the liquid effluent is directly discharged into freshwater 46 pharmaceuticals present in water can also reach freshwater through run off from land that is treated with digested sludge for agricultural purposes 46 48 furthermore ecs discharged by hospital effluents can reach the groundwater by leaching from the soil which can threaten the quality of drinking water the types of hospital services and healthcare procedures vary across different regions of the world therefore the significant pathways for exposure also vary geographically for instance the treatment models being used in developed countries are different from those being used in developing countries given the differences in their available facilities and treatment technologies therefore the exposure pathway of a specific region may not apply to other regions fig 2 shows the major routes of hww flowing to aquatic environments to the food chain and ultimately to wwtps for treatment and disposal 4 regulations and guidelines for hww while countries and international organizations have set their own guidelines for wastewater treatment the guidelines set by the who remains dominant for the pre treatment of effluents from healthcare facilities 49 depending on the service level and treatment procedures of the healthcare facility the discharged wastewater may contain pharmaceuticals chemicals transmittable pathogens or radioactive residues 50 the who guidelines provide a basis to explain the toxic nature of these wastewaters and recommend the procedure for the safe management of hww 51 52 a pre treatment of wastewater coming from medical laboratories and dental departments is usually applied but an amalgam separator must be initially installed the minimum requirements for releasing hww into municipal treatment drains include the following 1 an efficient sewage treatment system with primary secondary and tertiary treatment units 2 the municipal sewerage system must be connected to a central treatment facility and must be able to remove at least 95 of bacteria from wastewater 51 3 the sludge residue obtained after treatment should be subjected to anaerobic digestion and leave minimum amounts of microscopic helminth eggs per litre in the digested sludge 51 4 high standards must be maintained to ensure that low the treated wastewater only has low levels of toxic compounds cytotoxic drugs antibiotics radiation material and pharmaceuticals 49 53 the international commission on radiological protection icrp published some guidelines for the safe release of patients treated with open nuclides 54 given that those patients subjected to radioactive treatment may have radioactive compounds in their excretory substances the icrp recommends that the urine of these patients should be stored after therapy and suggests that the radionuclides released into sewage systems may expose sewage workers and others to radiation 55 in the us the environmental protection agency epa implemented the 1972 clean water act to regulate how effluents are discharged into water and to specify the effluent parameters for wwtps 50 although no laws or guidelines for managing hospital effluents have been implemented in europe the european directive n 91 of may 21 1991 91 271 cee modified from directive 27 of february 1998 n 98 15 ce requires a pre authorization of urban wastewater before its discharge into urban wastewater collection systems moreover the european directive n 98 of november 19 2008 eu 2008 98 ec states that some hospital effluents i e pharmaceuticals and personal care products or ppcps must not be released into sewer systems but should be treated as waste and collected prior to disposal some european laws also define how hazardous waste should be managed and the european directive decision lists some hazardous waste from hospitals including liquid waste medicinal products medications and material contaminants from substances used as solvents and soaps that should not be dumped in filthy drains 56 following these laws hospital facilities in europe should meet specific industrial requirements before they can discharge wastewater into municipal wwtps a pre treatment is usually required such as in the case of spain but none of the existing requirements pertains to the characteristics of hospital waste 49 in some instances when the general requirements implemented by wwtp authorities are met the wastewater can be considered acceptable sewage and can be dumped without any pre treatment 49 even when the indicator parameters exceed the limits the wastewater may be pre treated such as in the case of italy 38 table 3 presents the guidelines and regulations for hww treatment implemented in various countries and regulatory authorities the us epa maintains a contaminant candidate list ccl the most recent edition of which is the 2008 ccl3 which lists several endocannabinoid compounds estrone and organofluorine compounds including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and some flame retardants 57 however regulations that specify the maximum acceptable proportions of these contaminants are yet to be introduced ecological testing of pharmaceuticals in marine environments is currently not required by the us food and drug administration fda unless their concentration exceeds 1 ug l 58 the fda has also introduced a plan to monitor the harmful effects of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs on humans and wildlife 59 the document proposed some suggestions for edcs compounds in consumer goods inert ingredients and aesthetics however the us has no available laws that govern the effects of drinking water and wastewater on the environment 60 table 4 presents the regulations for ecs that have been implemented in the us european union and canada however there are still many contaminants whose environmental impacts are yet to be explored thereby presenting a major obstacle for regulatory bodies that are responsible for issuing wastewater legislations having further research regarding the sources fate and transport of these ecs would help the policymakers and decision makers to design and implement the regulations more efficiently this will ensure the limited release of ecs into the natural environment 5 ecs in hww the major ecs in hww include diagnostic agents disinfectants phacs and ppcps hww contains various ppcps that affect communities and individuals within localities over the past decade more than 300 phacs including their metabolites and some derivatives with high concentration have been identified in hww and have been traced in wwtps 49 various secondary wwtps were effective in removing the phacs from hww for instance a study reported that sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim have removal rates of 21 33 60 83 and 48 85 respectively phacs generally have an overall removal rate of 79 99 with the exception of naproxen which has a removal rate of 57 60 62 63 given these differences further research on individual pharmaceutical groups needs to be conducted however the literature suggests that the removal rate of most pharmaceuticals in wwtp except for naproxen exceeds 90 45 group of ppcps such as antibiotics inhibit bacterial growth which may affect the treatment process 64 pcps including toothpaste soap and dishwashing liquids are being used in daily life and anti bacterial and anti fungal pcps such as triclosan are being used in hospitals other anti depressants work to inhibit the action and production of neurotransmitters some of the most famous antidepressants include venlafaxine and citalopram of which the former is a reabsorption activator of serotonin norepinephrine that is often used for treating depression 65 wwtps in montreal canada have reported removal rates of 10 12 for antidepressants including citalopram and venlafaxine 45 estrogens which are not only found in hospital waste but are also being released by humans and animals through their urine and feces had a reported removal efficiency of 40 90 in a study that was made among five wwtps in bangkok 66 the aforementioned antidepressants have low removal rates however the wwtp in montreal canada is only equipped with primary treatment and wwtp with secondary or tertiary treatment are expected to have higher removal efficiency 45 67 in order to eliminate such class of ppcps from wastewater primary and secondary treatment processes required advanced treatment technologies more advance research is needed to study the fate of ppcps following more advanced treatments 6 health and environmental risks associated with hww hww is 5 15 times more toxic than domestic wastewater 14 the release of healthcare effluents carrying ecs into the aquatic environment poses a high risk to water quality aquatic ecosystems and human health 7 68 infectious outbreaks in low income countries are among the most serious consequences of releasing these ecs into aquatic environments while the pollution from pharmaceuticals and other chemicals remains the major health risk for people in developing and high income countries 22 the chemicals being discharged by hospitals contaminate the water systems of cities and may cause skin diseases or enteric illness similarly the microorganisms from hww have been known to cause diarrhoea and cholera outbreaks 33 the majority of these contaminants are capable of inhibiting biological activities at treatment plants 14 69 the ecs in hww effluents escape from wwtps and their widespread occurrence in water bodies such as lakes rivers and groundwater can be detrimental to the health of humans and wildlife ecs and their residues enter and accumulate in the food chain via discharged effluents and through the reuse of treated sewage sludge for agriculture application 70 antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones macrolides sulfonamides β lactam lincosamides trimethoprim and metronidazole are generally found in hww 39 71 the residual quantities of these antibiotics in hww can increase the resistance of bacteria to a wide range of biocides 72 antimicrobial excretion in combination with high microbial biomass and an abundance of nutrients makes wastewater a potential location for horizontal gene transfer and become a reservoir of antimicrobial resistant bacteria 73 specifically the occurrence of resistant organisms can be expected in hospital facilities where medicines are being used on a large scale through this path resistance genes are introduced in natural bacterial ecosystems where non pathogenic bacteria can serve as reservoirs of resistance genes 74 75 antibiotic resistance genes may also spread in drinking and recreational water and facilitate the spread and evolution of clinical resistance genes and their vectors opportunistic pathogens may become resistant upon acquiring a resistant gene 76 multidrug resistant bacteria in the environment can infect humans and animals via contaminated food and drinking water or directly from the environment 77 while antibiotic resistant bacteria are not considered primary pathogens they can threaten public health by transmitting their resistance to other microorganisms particularly human pathogens 78 79 although several studies have identified the presence of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics in hospital effluents their environmental effects and persistence in conventional wastewater treatment processes remain largely unknown 80 certain substances discharged by hww such as antitumor agents antibiotics and organohalogen compounds pass through wwtps without any degradation after these substances reach the aquatic system they negatively affect the receiving waters and their living species 69 some of these ppcps bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms and lead to unexpected disturbances for instance chronic long term exposure to estrogenic contaminants in water can lead to liver enlargement in fish 81 some substances found in wastewaters are genotoxic and are suspected to be a possible cause of cancers observed over the past decades 25 water genotoxicity studies are of interest because epidemiologic investigations have established a link between genotoxic drinking water intake and a rise in cancers 82 the occurrence of ecs in hww their pathways and their associated health risks are shown in fig 3 pharmaceuticals such as psychotropic substances at trace concentrations i e ng l to μg l have toxic effects on aquatic organisms the effects of wwtp effluents on the oogenesis and or embryogenesis of amphipod crustacean gammarus fossarum japanese fish medaka oryzias latipes mollusk radix peregra and planarian schmidtea polychroa have also been reported 9 a decrease in the number of oocytes and produced embryos has been observed in g fossarum and s polychroa 9 similarly effluents can affect the hatching rate of r peregra and the macroinvertebrate communities living in the receiving rivers 83 84 therefore further research is required to understand the potential impacts of residues of different pharmaceuticals on ecosystem service delivery and to characterize the relationship between ecosystem services and human well being 85 there may be hundreds of disease causing organisms present in sewage and wastewater that are yet to be identified therefore hww poses a greater threat to human health 86 future research should focus on the occurrence and driving factors of a wide range of ppcps in various environmental matrices and their impacts on human health due to long term exposure 7 technologies for hww treatment various treatment techniques are currently employed for the removal of various pollutants including ecs and pharmaceuticals from water 33 87 93 this section reviews the most studied among these technologies fig 4 shows various treatment processes in a typical wwtp 7 1 conventional wastewater treatment table 5 summarizes the ecs concentration in hww and their removal efficiencies in various conventional treatment technologies conventional technologies for wastewater treatment can be categorized into preliminary primary secondary and tertiary technologies as discussed below 7 1 1 ecs removal during preliminary and primary treatments removal of ecs during the primary treatment process is limited due to the hydrophilic nature of the hospital wastewater contaminants 3 94 the efficiency of coagulation flocculation and flotation in removing ecs from hospital effluents have been examined in previous studies 95 96 for instance a study in brazil used a septic tank and an anaerobic filter filled with raw effluent from a hospital and found that only diclofenac and some fragrances have an average removal of more than 60 whereas ciprofloxacin has the removal of only 17 96 another study reported a 28 removal efficiency for estriol e3 in sedimentation tanks 97 triclosan tcs removal by primary treatment varies significantly due to the high water consumption rate and short hydraulic retention time in a sedimentation tank 98 adsorption is recognized as one of the main mechanisms of ppcps removal in primary treatment processes 95 studies have identified that ozonation fenton and photo fenton processes as suitable solutions for the preliminary treatment of hww from a technical perspective 99 100 an improved biodegradability can be achieved via photo fenton processes 99 which may also work as a disinfectant step given its ability to remove total coliforms and thermos tolerant coliforms 100 a septic tank is used in three hospital wwtp located in brazil nepal and ethiopia in this septic tank by decelerating the wastewater flow part of the solids settles to the bottom of the tank while the floatable solids e g fats oil and grease rise to the top up to 50 of the solids retained in the tank are decomposed whereas the rest accumulate as sludge at the bottom and need to be removed periodically by pumping the tank 49 another example of primary treatment is chemical flocculation which is applied in a dedicated full scale hospital wwtp in korea with the aim of removing suspended solids and colloids from wastewater that does not settle spontaneously 101 lien et al 2016 applied filtration and other physicochemical processes as preliminary treatment before conventional activated sludge cas treatment in two hospitals in vietnam 102 an economic analysis should be performed to assess investment operational and maintenance costs moreover the adequateness of adopting these advanced technologies as pre treatment also needs to be confirmed from a toxicological perspective the capabilities of primary treatment processes i e sedimentation in removing ppcps are very limited given the hydrophilic nature of most ppcps 3 94 primary treatment is also insufficient to remove ppcps however up to 40 of fragrances e g toxalide fragrance ahtn and galaxolide fragrance hhcb can be efficiently removed in primary treatment due to the high partition coefficients between the liquid and solid phases a study found a strong correlation between the concentrations of ahtn and hhcb in sewage treatment plant stp effluent r2 0 71 103 the similar removal mechanisms of ahtn and hhcb namely sorption and volatilization in stps resulted from their similar physicochemical properties 70 7 1 2 ecs removal in secondary treatment the technologies applied in secondary wastewater treatment should be carefully chosen based on their present level of application at full scale wwtps and their performance for the removal of the selected ecs 104 previous studies suggest that cas procedure and ultrafiltration uf membrane bioreactors can effectively remove ecs from hww 39 105 moving bed biofilm reactors have also been introduced as potential alternatives to the cas process and membrane filtration bioreactors and have been proven to efficiently remove ecs 104 the cas technology requires a settling step at the end yet it has been widely applied in large scale sewage treatment plants conversely membrane filtration which requires one processing component in the membrane filtration bioreactor helps to achieve a clear good quality effluent after treatment 49 the cas method and membrane filtration bioreactors can also effectively remove some major compounds from hww such as methylparaben caffeine ethylparaben triclosan ibuprofen and galaxolide 106 several experiments have proven that membrane filtration bioreactors are approximately 30 55 more efficient than the cas method 39 in addition membrane filtration bioreactors can remove mefenamic acid diclofenac indomethacin and gemfibrozil more effectively than the cas method 39 however some materials such as carbamazepine have not been removed by either of these approaches 39 given their high cost and frequent maintenance requirements membrane filtration bioreactors are not widely used for treating hospital effluents 31 many countries also prefer using the cas method due to its cost effectiveness and high efficiency under different conditions 49 in general the ecs degradation rate observed in hospital wwtps is higher than that observed in urban wwtps however the concentration of ecs in hww remains higher after undergoing biological treatment in hospital wwtps than in urban wwtps given the higher influent concentration in the former 49 pharmaceuticals from all investigated therapeutic classes i e beta blockers nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics analgesics and anticonvulsants have been efficiently removed except for carbamazepine high removal efficiency for antibiotics non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and beta blockers are observed during the hww treatment 107 based on these removal rates a separate treatment can benefit the removal of ecs from hww 107 analgesic paracetamol has the highest concentration among all pharmaceuticals in wastewaters but also shows the highest removal efficiency 99 9 conversely the anticonvulsant carbamazepine has the lowest concentration but is hardly removed during treatment 3 5 removal rate a study reported that carbamazepine concentrations in hospital treated effluents hte are slightly higher than those in the effluent hww 107 fig 5 illustrates a typical cas process 7 1 3 ecs removal in tertiary treatment those pollutants that are not removed during the aforementioned processes are removed in tertiary treatment filtering through activated carbon in powdered or granular form has been applied to remove ecs and other compounds through sorption 108 109 several studies have assessed the adsorption of other emerging trace and organics comprising a range of ppcps and edcs on activated carbon in both laboratory systems and full scale wwtps 110 111 however only a few have examined granular activated carbon adsorption as an option for tertiary wastewater treatment granular activated carbon facilities in conventional wwtps achieve removal of 74 and 80 for erythromycin and carbamazepine respectively 112 tertiary treatment can be applied exclusively or in combination with uv or chlorine disinfection or polishing 49 a study presented a global overview of tertiary treatment for removing pollutants in hospital effluents 39 different strategies such as poly aluminum chloride uv and advanced oxidation processes aops have also been assessed for their pollutant removal efficiency adding granular activated carbon at approximately one gram per litre into the aeration tank of an activated sludge reactor can help remove phacs groups such as carbamazepine diclofenac and diazepam 113 the nh4cl induced activated carbon nac has also been studied for the removal of phacs from water 114 however only a few studies have examined the application of pac and membrane bioreactors for removing micropollutants despite the proven efficiency of these technologies a bigger picture of the process is yet to be drawn even though their removal performance has already been reported in the literature 115 116 activated carbon has also been proven to effectively remove ppcp residues from the treated effluents results of these studies show that activated carbon beds can be a suitable alternative to ozone treatment with 90 98 ppcps removal efficiency these carbon beds can remove 43 64 of pcps from sewage effluents in large scale sewage treatment plants and have demonstrated their efficiency in removing estrogens however their removal rates vary across different types of pcps for instance antispasmodics have removal rates of 84 99 whereas carbamazepine and propranolol have removal rates of only 17 23 117 several reactors have also been examined for their application of biotransformation and adsorption in removing ppcps when opting for a suitable treatment for ppcps some factors such as the associated hydraulics operating cost and capacity clogging problem must be taken into consideration 118 the tertiary treatment has been used solely or in combination with other polishing treatment including chlorine disinfection 36 39 disinfection is crucial in ensuring the safe discharge of wastewater to drainage systems and water bodies 38 this process is always performed right before the products are discharged to the environment the different removal efficiency of ppcps and ecs are obtained through different treatment technologies employed for the treatment of hww 49 powdered activated carbon uv and aops have removal rates of greater than 90 for phacs whereas chlorination and coagulation for phacs removal only achieve removal rates of 20 70 and 20 40 respectively 119 parabens are widely used in food and ppcps and can be removed by conventional sewage treatment plants with a more than 90 removal rate 120 however few parabens and their byproducts in conventional sewage treatment plants are removed by using advanced treatment techniques such as uf and ozonation 121 results of another study show that only 1 10 of the target ppcps can be removed by uf in this case low removal efficiency may be linked to the small size of the target hww contaminants than to the membrane pores 122 during the backwashing several parabens released from the membrane or during ph fluctuations of the influent 123 however ozonation achieves a removal rate of more than 98 for parabens except for de chlorinated compounds these findings agree with a previous study that reported a parabens removal rate of 99 100 by ozonation within a short hydraulic retention time 124 several studies have also highlighted the effectiveness of uv radiation in removing ppcps and found that the combination of biological processes and uv can noticeably improve the collective treatment of ppcps in sewage treatment plants 122 125 126 a study found that incorporating filtration and ozonation into the cas process can effectively remove most of the target ppcps with a removal rate of about 80 127 compared with the use of a single biological process those systems that combine bioreactors and aops e g uv o3 h2o2 noticeably enhance the removal efficiencies of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide from 59 and 35 to 99 respectively 128 while the chemicals added during chlorination and ozonation have some toxicity they show a high pollutant removal efficiency 128 however these chemical techniques do not effectively remove biologically active antibiotics and light resistant uv filters 129 7 2 membrane filtration membrane filtration techniques such as reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf are effective processes for removing emerging pollutants from wastewater 70 nf removes pharmaceutical compounds pollutants from wastewater in three steps namely adsorption sieving and electrostatic repulsion 137 the physical properties of pollutants including their charge molecular size diffusivity solubility hydrophobicity and polarity determine their removal efficiency other factors that affect pollutant removal include membrane properties water feed quality and membrane operating conditions 138 the capabilities of two types of submerged nf flat sheet modules in removing pharmaceuticals from stps have been investigated in previous research 139 both of these membranes have retained approximately 60 of diclofenac and naproxen and only removed a small proportion of carbamazepine 140 therefore unlike carbamazepine diclofenac and naproxen may be obstructed by the negatively charged membrane surface 140 however in all sewage treatment plants this treatment step may not be successful based on its removal efficiencies for the aforementioned compounds for more polar compounds nf usually achieves a higher pollutant removal efficiency compared with uf membrane 141 the application of ro and nf membrane for removing ppcps have also been analyzed in previous research 141 nf achieves average retention efficiencies of 82 and 97 for neutral pollutants and ionic contaminants respectively whereas ro can achieve removal rates of 85 99 a study compared the potential application of different structural patterns for removing ppcps from selected water sources and found that combining ozone treatment with nf greatly affects the pollutant removal potential 142 for example nf followed by ozonation can remove 90 of pollutants from both natural water and secondary effluents with ozone doses of 2 25 mg l and 3 75 mg l respectively 70 by contrast ozonation with an initial dose of 2 25 mg l followed by nf in natural waters can achieve a high removal efficiency of 70 in the permeate stream 143 while nf and ro can effectively degrade ppcps some substances do not pass from the membranes 70 uf and ro can remove 80 edcs and pharmaceuticals 63 144 in addition ro achieves a removal efficiency of 90 for naturally occurring and synthetic steroids organohalides and other compounds 145 however ro achieves low removal rates for diclofenac 55 2 60 and ketoprofen 64 3 a study reported that ro achieved removal rates of 90 or better for naturally occurring and synthetic steroids organohalides and other compounds ro can remove all the investigated compounds below their corresponding detection limits including those that have not been significantly removed at sludge retention time srts of 30 days e g galaxolide via cas or media filtration 39 many studies have investigated the rejection of ecs by fo membranes whose rejection mechanisms are similar to those of nf and ro the rejection of ecs is mainly governed by size exclusion steric interaction and electrostatic interactions the affinity of specific organic molecules to the forward osmosis fo membrane e g through hydrophobic interaction may also influence the rejection particularly when the solute is comparable in size or smaller than the pore of the fo membrane 146 table 6 presents the membrane based separations of ecs and their removal efficiencies 8 current hww management practices in various countries each country adopts a different approach to hww treatment as shown in table 7 hww is continuously being discharged into wastewater drains unchecked and eventually flow into municipal wwtps where they are mixed with effluents before final treatment 156 this practice is common in iran japan egypt australia south africa india bangladesh congo algeria vietnam ethiopia pakistan nepal and taiwan 49 the worldwide distribution of ecs removal from hww is shown in fig 6 hospital effluents are imminent sources of toxic compounds in aquatic environments due to their discharge into drains and freshwater bodies without pre treatment 158 table 7 shows the treatment methods adopted by various countries for instance the majority of the hospitals in pakistan discharge their wastewater without pre treatment 159 160 whereas some hospitals in taiwan discharge effluents directly into freshwater bodies without treatment 49 160 161 9 management of hww a conceptual framework to ensure efficient hww management government authorities pharmaceutical industries and scientific institutions that use scientific data and methodical approaches should work in a collaborative management cycle the unknown and new sources of contaminants must be considered by wastewater management including research institutions as sources of compounds whose physical and psychological health effects are yet to be characterized 180 financial institutions may also be incentivized to support wastewater treatment facilities and infrastructure in an integrated multifaceted public health risk reduction plan typically presented in the who guidelines 181 182 the most challenging part of this approach is the limited awareness of the public and private sectors and the poor enforcement of laws and regulations evaluating the available technologies plays an essential role in the creation and execution of policy packages 22 fig 7 presents a six step general conceptual framework for assessing and mitigating the human and ecological health risks associated with ecs in hww the six sequential steps are 1 identifying the hazard 2 analyzing risks 3 evaluating rating risks 4 identifying and evaluating the possible interventions 5 implementing a mitigation program and 6 monitoring and evaluating the program performance all ecs in aquatic environments comprise two or more compounds that act in a similar fashion have familiar synergic or addictive effects and show higher toxicity compared with single compounds 49 managing hww may be difficult given the unknown disastrous effects of ecs and because preventive measures can only be taken when the toxicity and concentrations of these compounds are known certain compounds in hww namely ofloaxacin 17α ethinyllestradiol erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole need to be managed more efficiently compared with others 185 the above framework can be modified to cover a wider spectrum of compounds and treatment scenarios 10 hww in the context of covid 19 healthcare facilities are significant sources of environmental contaminants especially during the covid 19 pandemic laboratory and research activities and medicine excretion by patients are major sources of these contaminants 186 various measures have been taken recently to investigate and treat infectious diseases 187 recent reports show that coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 was initially detected in the stool samples of infected patients 188 190 in this case in addition to direct contact and respiratory routes of infection the stool of patients can be another possible route of transmission for this virus 191 the possibility of fecal oral transmission has been recently highlighted by researchers where the virus can reach the human body by entering through the mouth mucus and contaminated water 189 therefore the possibility of transmitting sars cov 2 through fecally contaminated food should be considered poor sanitation facilities such as public toilets and handwashing facilities can facilitate a fecal or mucosal transmission of the virus when people touch their mouths noses and eyes without washing their hands 191 a study reported that infected people whether symptomatic or asymptomatic can spread sars cov 2 through their excreta 192 in addition people sharing the same toilet facility can infect their family members through feces aerosol transmission 191 fig 8 highlights the major routes of sars cov 2 transmission in water environments and their ultimate disposal in wwtp with the widespread of covid 19 in countries all over the world including australia 195 196 india 197 italy japan 198 us 199 ecuador 200 the netherlands 201 and china 191 the monitoring of sewage would allow very early detection of the entrance of the virus into a community 202 several studies from different countries have detected the genetic material of sars cov 2 in the stools of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients 188 203 205 however the capability of recovered patients to spread the virus is yet to be verified in addition these studies have produced inconsistent results that require a more in depth investigation for instance while some studies have detected the live virus in stools 188 203 205 others have only detected the genetic material of sars cov 2 fecal oral and fecal mucosal transmission should be considered in epidemic management and prevention because the viruses in sewage and sanitation facilities can last for long periods 204 previous studies show that sars cov 2 can survive at ph levels of 8 for instance a study reported that sars cov 2 is highly sensitive and can be inactivated in chlorinated water 206 by contrast it was reported that sars cov 2 rna was unexpectedly present in the septic tank after disinfection with 800 g m3 sodium hypochlorite 189 207 the virus might be protected by organic contents during disinfection has been released to the tank after the free chlorine levels have declined and spread through drainage pipelines therefore the existing protocol developed by who for hww disinfection may not be able to completely eliminate sars cov 2 from water waste handling and hygiene practices especially in healthcare and self quarantine centres therefore require revision 208 monitoring sewage can help determine the severity of the covid 19 outbreak and guide health authorities in implementing the relevant measures and tracking the source of the virus the sewage epidemiology or waste based epidemiology wbe method can be used to provide an early warning system for the covid 19 pandemic and to track potential outbreaks related to pathogenic viruses such as hepatitis a poliovirus and norovirus in wastewater environments sars cov 2 transferred through feces can survive from hours to days 209 polymerase chain reaction pcr can be used to detect the virus load in a patient and in wastewater moreover highly efficient and economic tools and methods for rapidly detecting sars cov 2 in wastewater have been developed including enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa biosensors and the paper based indicator method 210 for the above reasons wbe and rna based sars cov 2 detection have emerged as important research areas that can help authorities plan their public health interventions and safeguard their communities from other infectious diseases 11 knowledge gaps and future research directions given that hospital facilities treat patients suffering from different ailments hwws have 5 15 more pollution load compared with wastewater discharged from other sources 26 future research should then continue monitoring the ecs from hospital sewage and explore other advanced technologies for hww treatment future studies should also examine the effects of hospital effluents on human and environmental health the available data on human exposure to ecs released from hww is largely inconsistent and previous studies on the health and environmental impacts of hww have left many gaps therefore future studies should explore the ecs contained in hww across various regions and the occurrence and the corresponding drivers of pharmaceuticals to which humans are exposed the available data are also applicable to only a few geographic regions most of which are well regulated and have good infrastructure for water and wastewater treatment those regions that are lacking in such infrastructure tend to accumulate concentrations of ecs therefore hww monitoring campaigns should be promoted to measure the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the drinking water and food items being consumed in these regions and assess their effects on human health many studies have highlighted wastewater surveillance as a sensitive tool for monitoring the circulation of viruses in the population and may even complement the available measures for detecting the presence and prevalence of infectious diseases in cases when the capacity for clinical testing is limited however only a few studies have explored the survival of sars cov 2 in wastewater and their potential transmission through the environment given the persistence of the covid 19 pandemic the transmission of these viruses via hospital sewage and hww require an urgent investigation the potential of bioremediation and other novel techniques for the treatment of hww should also be explored 211 216 12 conclusion healthcare facilities discharge ecs and microbes into aquatic systems without prior treatment in most cases thereby threatening the health and sustainability of the environment given the high toxicity and pollutant load of hww relevant treatment methods and infrastructure should be designed based on the type of the discharging healthcare facility and the catchment area ecs are frequently detected downstream of wwtps given that these plants are not designed to eliminate all types of contaminants hwws mainly undergo pre treatment biological treatment advanced treatment and post treatment phases in these plants however advanced treatment steps such as ozonation activated carbon or aops are sometimes required to effectively eliminate these contaminants governments and scientific institutions also need to formulate a cooperative action plan to protect humans and the environment from these contaminants inputs from pharmaceutical industries may also be taken into consideration and financial institutions can be incentivized to support wastewater treatment facilities and infrastructure these initiatives require coordination and mobilization among different stakeholders and enforcement of the relevant laws and regulations amid the covid 19 pandemic the wastewater discharged from hospitals and quarantine centres have introduced additional environmental challenges proper management and surveillance of this wastewater can contribute to the overall management of the pandemic and to advanced planning for another possible wave of infections credit authorship contribution statement muhammad tariq khan conceptualization

13503,a wide range of emerging contaminants ecs such as pharmaceutically active compounds personal care products pcps endocrine disrupting compounds edcs and hormones are released into hospital wastewater hww these contaminants can enter into natural environments such as aquatic and terrestrial ones thereby threatening human health and aquatic life conventional wastewater treatment plants are not designed to treat all types of chemical and biological contaminants thereby allowing the release of these contaminants into water bodies such as rivers streams and groundwater accordingly adequate measures and advanced technologies should be implemented to prevent the discharge of ecs into aquatic environments reducing environmental health risks of hww is particularly important amid the persistence of the covid 19 pandemic although the necessary guidelines and legislation for wastewater treatment are available efficient removal of ecs from hww requires the applications of advanced treatment technologies this paper provides a comprehensive review of the existing healthcare structures ecs pathways to the environment management practices and effective treatment options for removing ecs from hww a critical evaluation of the current research advances knowledge gaps and directions for future research is also presented keywords hospital wastewater water treatment emerging contaminants environment membranes 1 introduction the provision of healthcare services requires the use of chemical substances to guarantee proper diagnosis treatment disinfection and patient recovery 1 these substances are classified into pharmaceutically active compounds phacs required for healthcare procedures e g investigations surgery medications and imaging and chemicals for controlling nosocomial infections e g disinfectants 2 3 these chemical compounds both in their raw forms or as metabolites or conjugates are excreted from the bodies of patients through their urine and feces and are often washed into sewage systems 4 the emerging contaminants ecs detected in trace concentrations ranging from μg l to ng l can escape wastewater treatment plants wwtps and thereby lead to environmental contamination 4 6 healthcare facilities account for approximately 20 25 of medicine usage among humans with some hospitals using tons of medicines annually 7 8 hospital effluents have been reported to contain tens to several hundreds of micrograms per litre concentrations of antibiotics cytostatic and other drugs 9 10 in some low flow sewer networks hospital effluents account for 80 of all pharmaceuticals and personal care products pcps in the network load 7 hospital wastewaters hww are considered major contributors to ecs 11 12 other routes for ecs entering into hww include the direct disposal of unused or expired drugs landfill leachates and application of sewage sludge to ensure soil fertility 13 many studies have reported that hospitals release untreated or inappropriately treated waste that contains pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics and resistant genes into ambient aquatic environments 7 14 15 the existence of these pharmaceuticals in various environmental matrices including surface water groundwater soil and sediments can threaten human health biota and the environment 16 17 therefore it is critical to properly treat the hospital effluents to minimize their adverse impacts on the environment 18 table 1 highlights the typical characteristics of hww while several countries have adopted regulations for ecs wwtps are neither particularly designed for treating emissions nor have any standards and guidelines for treating micropollutants for instance the european parliament through directive 2008 105 ec has regulated environmental quality standards for a very small number of emerging micropollutants i e bisphenol a diiron and nonylphenol 19 similarly nonylphenol ethoxylates and nonylphenol have been recognized as toxic substances by the government of canada 20 21 other hww micropollutants including phacs pcps and steroid hormones are still excluded from the list of regulated substances further research is required to investigate the effect of these contaminants on public and ecological health and to establish regulatory standards for micropollutants 22 the existence of micropollutants in the environmental matrices pose challenges to public health and environmental sustainability therefore it is important to improve the efficiency of wastewater treatment facilities for the management of discharged effluents 16 wwtps play a vital role in reducing the levels of ecs in reclaimed water however in the majority of the cases these contaminants are not sufficiently removed in wastewater treatment processes and persist in the treated wastewater effluents thereby resulting in their presence in aquatic environments after discharge 4 7 23 24 several studies show that advanced treatment technologies should be installed to reduce the genotoxicity of hww 25 26 the public health risks resulting from these contaminants can be managed in several ways such as by removing pathogenic microorganisms and other chemical contaminants from wastewater and minimizing the exposure of humans to wastewater 22 pharmaceuticals can be removed at the source by implementing technical measures in hospitals or by collecting separate waste streams all of these options can substantially reduce the load of micropollutants previous studies on the presence of ecs in various water environments have not been thoroughly reviewed to provide a comprehensive summary of the presence occurrence of ecs in hospital effluents moreover the removal efficiency of ecs in wwtps treating the hww has been rarely investigated accordingly this review aims to address the following inter connected aspects reported in the literature 1 occurrence of ecs in hww 2 sources and pathways of ecs in hospital effluents 3 management practices 4 ecs treatment options and 5 knowledge gaps and future research directions this review will provide relevant information that can guide decision makers and environmental scientists in their future policies and research endeavours 2 water demand and consumption in healthcare facilities hospitals require large amounts of water every day for various purposes and services however each hospital has a different daily water consumption rate 35 the quantity of wastewater produced by hospitals also depends on several factors including their number of beds water supply availability of general services i e laundry kitchen and air conditioning types and number of wards or units and management policies 36 fig 1 shows the percentage of water consumption of various healthcare services in hospitals 37 in addition the water demand typically observed in hospitals is estimated to range from 200 l to 1200 l bed 1 day 1 38 39 the consumption of water in a hospital environment is accompanied by an equal amount of wastewater discharge hospital effluents also contain domestic discharge coming from kitchens laundries and toilets the water demand for various healthcare facilities is presented in table 2 7 40 3 sources and transport of ecs in hospital effluents hospitals generate a large amount of wastewater that contain different varieties of pollutants 4 7 41 hww consists of ecs and pathogens that are excreted from human bodies through urine and feces and often end up in sewer systems which remain the major path for these contaminants to enter municipal sewage systems fig 2 4 42 44 consumer products such as soaps disinfectants and shampoos are other sources of ecs 45 the ecs released from these products are transported to wwtps to undergo a treatment process however not all wwtps are capable of removing all types of ecs discharged by hospitals therefore they routinely help ecs to enter the natural environment 46 the presence of these ecs in the environment can threaten both public health and the ecosystem given the unique physicochemical properties i e polarity water solubility microbial resistance and persistence of ecs in hww these bioactive chemicals may also bioaccumulate in the food chain 4 humans are particularly exposed to drinking water that is produced from surface water 47 moreover after treating these contaminants the sludge is applied to the soil as fertilizer whereas the liquid effluent is directly discharged into freshwater 46 pharmaceuticals present in water can also reach freshwater through run off from land that is treated with digested sludge for agricultural purposes 46 48 furthermore ecs discharged by hospital effluents can reach the groundwater by leaching from the soil which can threaten the quality of drinking water the types of hospital services and healthcare procedures vary across different regions of the world therefore the significant pathways for exposure also vary geographically for instance the treatment models being used in developed countries are different from those being used in developing countries given the differences in their available facilities and treatment technologies therefore the exposure pathway of a specific region may not apply to other regions fig 2 shows the major routes of hww flowing to aquatic environments to the food chain and ultimately to wwtps for treatment and disposal 4 regulations and guidelines for hww while countries and international organizations have set their own guidelines for wastewater treatment the guidelines set by the who remains dominant for the pre treatment of effluents from healthcare facilities 49 depending on the service level and treatment procedures of the healthcare facility the discharged wastewater may contain pharmaceuticals chemicals transmittable pathogens or radioactive residues 50 the who guidelines provide a basis to explain the toxic nature of these wastewaters and recommend the procedure for the safe management of hww 51 52 a pre treatment of wastewater coming from medical laboratories and dental departments is usually applied but an amalgam separator must be initially installed the minimum requirements for releasing hww into municipal treatment drains include the following 1 an efficient sewage treatment system with primary secondary and tertiary treatment units 2 the municipal sewerage system must be connected to a central treatment facility and must be able to remove at least 95 of bacteria from wastewater 51 3 the sludge residue obtained after treatment should be subjected to anaerobic digestion and leave minimum amounts of microscopic helminth eggs per litre in the digested sludge 51 4 high standards must be maintained to ensure that low the treated wastewater only has low levels of toxic compounds cytotoxic drugs antibiotics radiation material and pharmaceuticals 49 53 the international commission on radiological protection icrp published some guidelines for the safe release of patients treated with open nuclides 54 given that those patients subjected to radioactive treatment may have radioactive compounds in their excretory substances the icrp recommends that the urine of these patients should be stored after therapy and suggests that the radionuclides released into sewage systems may expose sewage workers and others to radiation 55 in the us the environmental protection agency epa implemented the 1972 clean water act to regulate how effluents are discharged into water and to specify the effluent parameters for wwtps 50 although no laws or guidelines for managing hospital effluents have been implemented in europe the european directive n 91 of may 21 1991 91 271 cee modified from directive 27 of february 1998 n 98 15 ce requires a pre authorization of urban wastewater before its discharge into urban wastewater collection systems moreover the european directive n 98 of november 19 2008 eu 2008 98 ec states that some hospital effluents i e pharmaceuticals and personal care products or ppcps must not be released into sewer systems but should be treated as waste and collected prior to disposal some european laws also define how hazardous waste should be managed and the european directive decision lists some hazardous waste from hospitals including liquid waste medicinal products medications and material contaminants from substances used as solvents and soaps that should not be dumped in filthy drains 56 following these laws hospital facilities in europe should meet specific industrial requirements before they can discharge wastewater into municipal wwtps a pre treatment is usually required such as in the case of spain but none of the existing requirements pertains to the characteristics of hospital waste 49 in some instances when the general requirements implemented by wwtp authorities are met the wastewater can be considered acceptable sewage and can be dumped without any pre treatment 49 even when the indicator parameters exceed the limits the wastewater may be pre treated such as in the case of italy 38 table 3 presents the guidelines and regulations for hww treatment implemented in various countries and regulatory authorities the us epa maintains a contaminant candidate list ccl the most recent edition of which is the 2008 ccl3 which lists several endocannabinoid compounds estrone and organofluorine compounds including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and some flame retardants 57 however regulations that specify the maximum acceptable proportions of these contaminants are yet to be introduced ecological testing of pharmaceuticals in marine environments is currently not required by the us food and drug administration fda unless their concentration exceeds 1 ug l 58 the fda has also introduced a plan to monitor the harmful effects of endocrine disrupting compounds edcs on humans and wildlife 59 the document proposed some suggestions for edcs compounds in consumer goods inert ingredients and aesthetics however the us has no available laws that govern the effects of drinking water and wastewater on the environment 60 table 4 presents the regulations for ecs that have been implemented in the us european union and canada however there are still many contaminants whose environmental impacts are yet to be explored thereby presenting a major obstacle for regulatory bodies that are responsible for issuing wastewater legislations having further research regarding the sources fate and transport of these ecs would help the policymakers and decision makers to design and implement the regulations more efficiently this will ensure the limited release of ecs into the natural environment 5 ecs in hww the major ecs in hww include diagnostic agents disinfectants phacs and ppcps hww contains various ppcps that affect communities and individuals within localities over the past decade more than 300 phacs including their metabolites and some derivatives with high concentration have been identified in hww and have been traced in wwtps 49 various secondary wwtps were effective in removing the phacs from hww for instance a study reported that sulfamethoxazole ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim have removal rates of 21 33 60 83 and 48 85 respectively phacs generally have an overall removal rate of 79 99 with the exception of naproxen which has a removal rate of 57 60 62 63 given these differences further research on individual pharmaceutical groups needs to be conducted however the literature suggests that the removal rate of most pharmaceuticals in wwtp except for naproxen exceeds 90 45 group of ppcps such as antibiotics inhibit bacterial growth which may affect the treatment process 64 pcps including toothpaste soap and dishwashing liquids are being used in daily life and anti bacterial and anti fungal pcps such as triclosan are being used in hospitals other anti depressants work to inhibit the action and production of neurotransmitters some of the most famous antidepressants include venlafaxine and citalopram of which the former is a reabsorption activator of serotonin norepinephrine that is often used for treating depression 65 wwtps in montreal canada have reported removal rates of 10 12 for antidepressants including citalopram and venlafaxine 45 estrogens which are not only found in hospital waste but are also being released by humans and animals through their urine and feces had a reported removal efficiency of 40 90 in a study that was made among five wwtps in bangkok 66 the aforementioned antidepressants have low removal rates however the wwtp in montreal canada is only equipped with primary treatment and wwtp with secondary or tertiary treatment are expected to have higher removal efficiency 45 67 in order to eliminate such class of ppcps from wastewater primary and secondary treatment processes required advanced treatment technologies more advance research is needed to study the fate of ppcps following more advanced treatments 6 health and environmental risks associated with hww hww is 5 15 times more toxic than domestic wastewater 14 the release of healthcare effluents carrying ecs into the aquatic environment poses a high risk to water quality aquatic ecosystems and human health 7 68 infectious outbreaks in low income countries are among the most serious consequences of releasing these ecs into aquatic environments while the pollution from pharmaceuticals and other chemicals remains the major health risk for people in developing and high income countries 22 the chemicals being discharged by hospitals contaminate the water systems of cities and may cause skin diseases or enteric illness similarly the microorganisms from hww have been known to cause diarrhoea and cholera outbreaks 33 the majority of these contaminants are capable of inhibiting biological activities at treatment plants 14 69 the ecs in hww effluents escape from wwtps and their widespread occurrence in water bodies such as lakes rivers and groundwater can be detrimental to the health of humans and wildlife ecs and their residues enter and accumulate in the food chain via discharged effluents and through the reuse of treated sewage sludge for agriculture application 70 antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones macrolides sulfonamides β lactam lincosamides trimethoprim and metronidazole are generally found in hww 39 71 the residual quantities of these antibiotics in hww can increase the resistance of bacteria to a wide range of biocides 72 antimicrobial excretion in combination with high microbial biomass and an abundance of nutrients makes wastewater a potential location for horizontal gene transfer and become a reservoir of antimicrobial resistant bacteria 73 specifically the occurrence of resistant organisms can be expected in hospital facilities where medicines are being used on a large scale through this path resistance genes are introduced in natural bacterial ecosystems where non pathogenic bacteria can serve as reservoirs of resistance genes 74 75 antibiotic resistance genes may also spread in drinking and recreational water and facilitate the spread and evolution of clinical resistance genes and their vectors opportunistic pathogens may become resistant upon acquiring a resistant gene 76 multidrug resistant bacteria in the environment can infect humans and animals via contaminated food and drinking water or directly from the environment 77 while antibiotic resistant bacteria are not considered primary pathogens they can threaten public health by transmitting their resistance to other microorganisms particularly human pathogens 78 79 although several studies have identified the presence of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics in hospital effluents their environmental effects and persistence in conventional wastewater treatment processes remain largely unknown 80 certain substances discharged by hww such as antitumor agents antibiotics and organohalogen compounds pass through wwtps without any degradation after these substances reach the aquatic system they negatively affect the receiving waters and their living species 69 some of these ppcps bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms and lead to unexpected disturbances for instance chronic long term exposure to estrogenic contaminants in water can lead to liver enlargement in fish 81 some substances found in wastewaters are genotoxic and are suspected to be a possible cause of cancers observed over the past decades 25 water genotoxicity studies are of interest because epidemiologic investigations have established a link between genotoxic drinking water intake and a rise in cancers 82 the occurrence of ecs in hww their pathways and their associated health risks are shown in fig 3 pharmaceuticals such as psychotropic substances at trace concentrations i e ng l to μg l have toxic effects on aquatic organisms the effects of wwtp effluents on the oogenesis and or embryogenesis of amphipod crustacean gammarus fossarum japanese fish medaka oryzias latipes mollusk radix peregra and planarian schmidtea polychroa have also been reported 9 a decrease in the number of oocytes and produced embryos has been observed in g fossarum and s polychroa 9 similarly effluents can affect the hatching rate of r peregra and the macroinvertebrate communities living in the receiving rivers 83 84 therefore further research is required to understand the potential impacts of residues of different pharmaceuticals on ecosystem service delivery and to characterize the relationship between ecosystem services and human well being 85 there may be hundreds of disease causing organisms present in sewage and wastewater that are yet to be identified therefore hww poses a greater threat to human health 86 future research should focus on the occurrence and driving factors of a wide range of ppcps in various environmental matrices and their impacts on human health due to long term exposure 7 technologies for hww treatment various treatment techniques are currently employed for the removal of various pollutants including ecs and pharmaceuticals from water 33 87 93 this section reviews the most studied among these technologies fig 4 shows various treatment processes in a typical wwtp 7 1 conventional wastewater treatment table 5 summarizes the ecs concentration in hww and their removal efficiencies in various conventional treatment technologies conventional technologies for wastewater treatment can be categorized into preliminary primary secondary and tertiary technologies as discussed below 7 1 1 ecs removal during preliminary and primary treatments removal of ecs during the primary treatment process is limited due to the hydrophilic nature of the hospital wastewater contaminants 3 94 the efficiency of coagulation flocculation and flotation in removing ecs from hospital effluents have been examined in previous studies 95 96 for instance a study in brazil used a septic tank and an anaerobic filter filled with raw effluent from a hospital and found that only diclofenac and some fragrances have an average removal of more than 60 whereas ciprofloxacin has the removal of only 17 96 another study reported a 28 removal efficiency for estriol e3 in sedimentation tanks 97 triclosan tcs removal by primary treatment varies significantly due to the high water consumption rate and short hydraulic retention time in a sedimentation tank 98 adsorption is recognized as one of the main mechanisms of ppcps removal in primary treatment processes 95 studies have identified that ozonation fenton and photo fenton processes as suitable solutions for the preliminary treatment of hww from a technical perspective 99 100 an improved biodegradability can be achieved via photo fenton processes 99 which may also work as a disinfectant step given its ability to remove total coliforms and thermos tolerant coliforms 100 a septic tank is used in three hospital wwtp located in brazil nepal and ethiopia in this septic tank by decelerating the wastewater flow part of the solids settles to the bottom of the tank while the floatable solids e g fats oil and grease rise to the top up to 50 of the solids retained in the tank are decomposed whereas the rest accumulate as sludge at the bottom and need to be removed periodically by pumping the tank 49 another example of primary treatment is chemical flocculation which is applied in a dedicated full scale hospital wwtp in korea with the aim of removing suspended solids and colloids from wastewater that does not settle spontaneously 101 lien et al 2016 applied filtration and other physicochemical processes as preliminary treatment before conventional activated sludge cas treatment in two hospitals in vietnam 102 an economic analysis should be performed to assess investment operational and maintenance costs moreover the adequateness of adopting these advanced technologies as pre treatment also needs to be confirmed from a toxicological perspective the capabilities of primary treatment processes i e sedimentation in removing ppcps are very limited given the hydrophilic nature of most ppcps 3 94 primary treatment is also insufficient to remove ppcps however up to 40 of fragrances e g toxalide fragrance ahtn and galaxolide fragrance hhcb can be efficiently removed in primary treatment due to the high partition coefficients between the liquid and solid phases a study found a strong correlation between the concentrations of ahtn and hhcb in sewage treatment plant stp effluent r2 0 71 103 the similar removal mechanisms of ahtn and hhcb namely sorption and volatilization in stps resulted from their similar physicochemical properties 70 7 1 2 ecs removal in secondary treatment the technologies applied in secondary wastewater treatment should be carefully chosen based on their present level of application at full scale wwtps and their performance for the removal of the selected ecs 104 previous studies suggest that cas procedure and ultrafiltration uf membrane bioreactors can effectively remove ecs from hww 39 105 moving bed biofilm reactors have also been introduced as potential alternatives to the cas process and membrane filtration bioreactors and have been proven to efficiently remove ecs 104 the cas technology requires a settling step at the end yet it has been widely applied in large scale sewage treatment plants conversely membrane filtration which requires one processing component in the membrane filtration bioreactor helps to achieve a clear good quality effluent after treatment 49 the cas method and membrane filtration bioreactors can also effectively remove some major compounds from hww such as methylparaben caffeine ethylparaben triclosan ibuprofen and galaxolide 106 several experiments have proven that membrane filtration bioreactors are approximately 30 55 more efficient than the cas method 39 in addition membrane filtration bioreactors can remove mefenamic acid diclofenac indomethacin and gemfibrozil more effectively than the cas method 39 however some materials such as carbamazepine have not been removed by either of these approaches 39 given their high cost and frequent maintenance requirements membrane filtration bioreactors are not widely used for treating hospital effluents 31 many countries also prefer using the cas method due to its cost effectiveness and high efficiency under different conditions 49 in general the ecs degradation rate observed in hospital wwtps is higher than that observed in urban wwtps however the concentration of ecs in hww remains higher after undergoing biological treatment in hospital wwtps than in urban wwtps given the higher influent concentration in the former 49 pharmaceuticals from all investigated therapeutic classes i e beta blockers nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs antibiotics analgesics and anticonvulsants have been efficiently removed except for carbamazepine high removal efficiency for antibiotics non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and beta blockers are observed during the hww treatment 107 based on these removal rates a separate treatment can benefit the removal of ecs from hww 107 analgesic paracetamol has the highest concentration among all pharmaceuticals in wastewaters but also shows the highest removal efficiency 99 9 conversely the anticonvulsant carbamazepine has the lowest concentration but is hardly removed during treatment 3 5 removal rate a study reported that carbamazepine concentrations in hospital treated effluents hte are slightly higher than those in the effluent hww 107 fig 5 illustrates a typical cas process 7 1 3 ecs removal in tertiary treatment those pollutants that are not removed during the aforementioned processes are removed in tertiary treatment filtering through activated carbon in powdered or granular form has been applied to remove ecs and other compounds through sorption 108 109 several studies have assessed the adsorption of other emerging trace and organics comprising a range of ppcps and edcs on activated carbon in both laboratory systems and full scale wwtps 110 111 however only a few have examined granular activated carbon adsorption as an option for tertiary wastewater treatment granular activated carbon facilities in conventional wwtps achieve removal of 74 and 80 for erythromycin and carbamazepine respectively 112 tertiary treatment can be applied exclusively or in combination with uv or chlorine disinfection or polishing 49 a study presented a global overview of tertiary treatment for removing pollutants in hospital effluents 39 different strategies such as poly aluminum chloride uv and advanced oxidation processes aops have also been assessed for their pollutant removal efficiency adding granular activated carbon at approximately one gram per litre into the aeration tank of an activated sludge reactor can help remove phacs groups such as carbamazepine diclofenac and diazepam 113 the nh4cl induced activated carbon nac has also been studied for the removal of phacs from water 114 however only a few studies have examined the application of pac and membrane bioreactors for removing micropollutants despite the proven efficiency of these technologies a bigger picture of the process is yet to be drawn even though their removal performance has already been reported in the literature 115 116 activated carbon has also been proven to effectively remove ppcp residues from the treated effluents results of these studies show that activated carbon beds can be a suitable alternative to ozone treatment with 90 98 ppcps removal efficiency these carbon beds can remove 43 64 of pcps from sewage effluents in large scale sewage treatment plants and have demonstrated their efficiency in removing estrogens however their removal rates vary across different types of pcps for instance antispasmodics have removal rates of 84 99 whereas carbamazepine and propranolol have removal rates of only 17 23 117 several reactors have also been examined for their application of biotransformation and adsorption in removing ppcps when opting for a suitable treatment for ppcps some factors such as the associated hydraulics operating cost and capacity clogging problem must be taken into consideration 118 the tertiary treatment has been used solely or in combination with other polishing treatment including chlorine disinfection 36 39 disinfection is crucial in ensuring the safe discharge of wastewater to drainage systems and water bodies 38 this process is always performed right before the products are discharged to the environment the different removal efficiency of ppcps and ecs are obtained through different treatment technologies employed for the treatment of hww 49 powdered activated carbon uv and aops have removal rates of greater than 90 for phacs whereas chlorination and coagulation for phacs removal only achieve removal rates of 20 70 and 20 40 respectively 119 parabens are widely used in food and ppcps and can be removed by conventional sewage treatment plants with a more than 90 removal rate 120 however few parabens and their byproducts in conventional sewage treatment plants are removed by using advanced treatment techniques such as uf and ozonation 121 results of another study show that only 1 10 of the target ppcps can be removed by uf in this case low removal efficiency may be linked to the small size of the target hww contaminants than to the membrane pores 122 during the backwashing several parabens released from the membrane or during ph fluctuations of the influent 123 however ozonation achieves a removal rate of more than 98 for parabens except for de chlorinated compounds these findings agree with a previous study that reported a parabens removal rate of 99 100 by ozonation within a short hydraulic retention time 124 several studies have also highlighted the effectiveness of uv radiation in removing ppcps and found that the combination of biological processes and uv can noticeably improve the collective treatment of ppcps in sewage treatment plants 122 125 126 a study found that incorporating filtration and ozonation into the cas process can effectively remove most of the target ppcps with a removal rate of about 80 127 compared with the use of a single biological process those systems that combine bioreactors and aops e g uv o3 h2o2 noticeably enhance the removal efficiencies of cyclophosphamide and ifosfamide from 59 and 35 to 99 respectively 128 while the chemicals added during chlorination and ozonation have some toxicity they show a high pollutant removal efficiency 128 however these chemical techniques do not effectively remove biologically active antibiotics and light resistant uv filters 129 7 2 membrane filtration membrane filtration techniques such as reverse osmosis ro and nanofiltration nf are effective processes for removing emerging pollutants from wastewater 70 nf removes pharmaceutical compounds pollutants from wastewater in three steps namely adsorption sieving and electrostatic repulsion 137 the physical properties of pollutants including their charge molecular size diffusivity solubility hydrophobicity and polarity determine their removal efficiency other factors that affect pollutant removal include membrane properties water feed quality and membrane operating conditions 138 the capabilities of two types of submerged nf flat sheet modules in removing pharmaceuticals from stps have been investigated in previous research 139 both of these membranes have retained approximately 60 of diclofenac and naproxen and only removed a small proportion of carbamazepine 140 therefore unlike carbamazepine diclofenac and naproxen may be obstructed by the negatively charged membrane surface 140 however in all sewage treatment plants this treatment step may not be successful based on its removal efficiencies for the aforementioned compounds for more polar compounds nf usually achieves a higher pollutant removal efficiency compared with uf membrane 141 the application of ro and nf membrane for removing ppcps have also been analyzed in previous research 141 nf achieves average retention efficiencies of 82 and 97 for neutral pollutants and ionic contaminants respectively whereas ro can achieve removal rates of 85 99 a study compared the potential application of different structural patterns for removing ppcps from selected water sources and found that combining ozone treatment with nf greatly affects the pollutant removal potential 142 for example nf followed by ozonation can remove 90 of pollutants from both natural water and secondary effluents with ozone doses of 2 25 mg l and 3 75 mg l respectively 70 by contrast ozonation with an initial dose of 2 25 mg l followed by nf in natural waters can achieve a high removal efficiency of 70 in the permeate stream 143 while nf and ro can effectively degrade ppcps some substances do not pass from the membranes 70 uf and ro can remove 80 edcs and pharmaceuticals 63 144 in addition ro achieves a removal efficiency of 90 for naturally occurring and synthetic steroids organohalides and other compounds 145 however ro achieves low removal rates for diclofenac 55 2 60 and ketoprofen 64 3 a study reported that ro achieved removal rates of 90 or better for naturally occurring and synthetic steroids organohalides and other compounds ro can remove all the investigated compounds below their corresponding detection limits including those that have not been significantly removed at sludge retention time srts of 30 days e g galaxolide via cas or media filtration 39 many studies have investigated the rejection of ecs by fo membranes whose rejection mechanisms are similar to those of nf and ro the rejection of ecs is mainly governed by size exclusion steric interaction and electrostatic interactions the affinity of specific organic molecules to the forward osmosis fo membrane e g through hydrophobic interaction may also influence the rejection particularly when the solute is comparable in size or smaller than the pore of the fo membrane 146 table 6 presents the membrane based separations of ecs and their removal efficiencies 8 current hww management practices in various countries each country adopts a different approach to hww treatment as shown in table 7 hww is continuously being discharged into wastewater drains unchecked and eventually flow into municipal wwtps where they are mixed with effluents before final treatment 156 this practice is common in iran japan egypt australia south africa india bangladesh congo algeria vietnam ethiopia pakistan nepal and taiwan 49 the worldwide distribution of ecs removal from hww is shown in fig 6 hospital effluents are imminent sources of toxic compounds in aquatic environments due to their discharge into drains and freshwater bodies without pre treatment 158 table 7 shows the treatment methods adopted by various countries for instance the majority of the hospitals in pakistan discharge their wastewater without pre treatment 159 160 whereas some hospitals in taiwan discharge effluents directly into freshwater bodies without treatment 49 160 161 9 management of hww a conceptual framework to ensure efficient hww management government authorities pharmaceutical industries and scientific institutions that use scientific data and methodical approaches should work in a collaborative management cycle the unknown and new sources of contaminants must be considered by wastewater management including research institutions as sources of compounds whose physical and psychological health effects are yet to be characterized 180 financial institutions may also be incentivized to support wastewater treatment facilities and infrastructure in an integrated multifaceted public health risk reduction plan typically presented in the who guidelines 181 182 the most challenging part of this approach is the limited awareness of the public and private sectors and the poor enforcement of laws and regulations evaluating the available technologies plays an essential role in the creation and execution of policy packages 22 fig 7 presents a six step general conceptual framework for assessing and mitigating the human and ecological health risks associated with ecs in hww the six sequential steps are 1 identifying the hazard 2 analyzing risks 3 evaluating rating risks 4 identifying and evaluating the possible interventions 5 implementing a mitigation program and 6 monitoring and evaluating the program performance all ecs in aquatic environments comprise two or more compounds that act in a similar fashion have familiar synergic or addictive effects and show higher toxicity compared with single compounds 49 managing hww may be difficult given the unknown disastrous effects of ecs and because preventive measures can only be taken when the toxicity and concentrations of these compounds are known certain compounds in hww namely ofloaxacin 17α ethinyllestradiol erythromycin and sulfamethoxazole need to be managed more efficiently compared with others 185 the above framework can be modified to cover a wider spectrum of compounds and treatment scenarios 10 hww in the context of covid 19 healthcare facilities are significant sources of environmental contaminants especially during the covid 19 pandemic laboratory and research activities and medicine excretion by patients are major sources of these contaminants 186 various measures have been taken recently to investigate and treat infectious diseases 187 recent reports show that coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 was initially detected in the stool samples of infected patients 188 190 in this case in addition to direct contact and respiratory routes of infection the stool of patients can be another possible route of transmission for this virus 191 the possibility of fecal oral transmission has been recently highlighted by researchers where the virus can reach the human body by entering through the mouth mucus and contaminated water 189 therefore the possibility of transmitting sars cov 2 through fecally contaminated food should be considered poor sanitation facilities such as public toilets and handwashing facilities can facilitate a fecal or mucosal transmission of the virus when people touch their mouths noses and eyes without washing their hands 191 a study reported that infected people whether symptomatic or asymptomatic can spread sars cov 2 through their excreta 192 in addition people sharing the same toilet facility can infect their family members through feces aerosol transmission 191 fig 8 highlights the major routes of sars cov 2 transmission in water environments and their ultimate disposal in wwtp with the widespread of covid 19 in countries all over the world including australia 195 196 india 197 italy japan 198 us 199 ecuador 200 the netherlands 201 and china 191 the monitoring of sewage would allow very early detection of the entrance of the virus into a community 202 several studies from different countries have detected the genetic material of sars cov 2 in the stools of asymptomatic and symptomatic patients 188 203 205 however the capability of recovered patients to spread the virus is yet to be verified in addition these studies have produced inconsistent results that require a more in depth investigation for instance while some studies have detected the live virus in stools 188 203 205 others have only detected the genetic material of sars cov 2 fecal oral and fecal mucosal transmission should be considered in epidemic management and prevention because the viruses in sewage and sanitation facilities can last for long periods 204 previous studies show that sars cov 2 can survive at ph levels of 8 for instance a study reported that sars cov 2 is highly sensitive and can be inactivated in chlorinated water 206 by contrast it was reported that sars cov 2 rna was unexpectedly present in the septic tank after disinfection with 800 g m3 sodium hypochlorite 189 207 the virus might be protected by organic contents during disinfection has been released to the tank after the free chlorine levels have declined and spread through drainage pipelines therefore the existing protocol developed by who for hww disinfection may not be able to completely eliminate sars cov 2 from water waste handling and hygiene practices especially in healthcare and self quarantine centres therefore require revision 208 monitoring sewage can help determine the severity of the covid 19 outbreak and guide health authorities in implementing the relevant measures and tracking the source of the virus the sewage epidemiology or waste based epidemiology wbe method can be used to provide an early warning system for the covid 19 pandemic and to track potential outbreaks related to pathogenic viruses such as hepatitis a poliovirus and norovirus in wastewater environments sars cov 2 transferred through feces can survive from hours to days 209 polymerase chain reaction pcr can be used to detect the virus load in a patient and in wastewater moreover highly efficient and economic tools and methods for rapidly detecting sars cov 2 in wastewater have been developed including enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa biosensors and the paper based indicator method 210 for the above reasons wbe and rna based sars cov 2 detection have emerged as important research areas that can help authorities plan their public health interventions and safeguard their communities from other infectious diseases 11 knowledge gaps and future research directions given that hospital facilities treat patients suffering from different ailments hwws have 5 15 more pollution load compared with wastewater discharged from other sources 26 future research should then continue monitoring the ecs from hospital sewage and explore other advanced technologies for hww treatment future studies should also examine the effects of hospital effluents on human and environmental health the available data on human exposure to ecs released from hww is largely inconsistent and previous studies on the health and environmental impacts of hww have left many gaps therefore future studies should explore the ecs contained in hww across various regions and the occurrence and the corresponding drivers of pharmaceuticals to which humans are exposed the available data are also applicable to only a few geographic regions most of which are well regulated and have good infrastructure for water and wastewater treatment those regions that are lacking in such infrastructure tend to accumulate concentrations of ecs therefore hww monitoring campaigns should be promoted to measure the concentrations of pharmaceuticals in the drinking water and food items being consumed in these regions and assess their effects on human health many studies have highlighted wastewater surveillance as a sensitive tool for monitoring the circulation of viruses in the population and may even complement the available measures for detecting the presence and prevalence of infectious diseases in cases when the capacity for clinical testing is limited however only a few studies have explored the survival of sars cov 2 in wastewater and their potential transmission through the environment given the persistence of the covid 19 pandemic the transmission of these viruses via hospital sewage and hww require an urgent investigation the potential of bioremediation and other novel techniques for the treatment of hww should also be explored 211 216 12 conclusion healthcare facilities discharge ecs and microbes into aquatic systems without prior treatment in most cases thereby threatening the health and sustainability of the environment given the high toxicity and pollutant load of hww relevant treatment methods and infrastructure should be designed based on the type of the discharging healthcare facility and the catchment area ecs are frequently detected downstream of wwtps given that these plants are not designed to eliminate all types of contaminants hwws mainly undergo pre treatment biological treatment advanced treatment and post treatment phases in these plants however advanced treatment steps such as ozonation activated carbon or aops are sometimes required to effectively eliminate these contaminants governments and scientific institutions also need to formulate a cooperative action plan to protect humans and the environment from these contaminants inputs from pharmaceutical industries may also be taken into consideration and financial institutions can be incentivized to support wastewater treatment facilities and infrastructure these initiatives require coordination and mobilization among different stakeholders and enforcement of the relevant laws and regulations amid the covid 19 pandemic the wastewater discharged from hospitals and quarantine centres have introduced additional environmental challenges proper management and surveillance of this wastewater can contribute to the overall management of the pandemic and to advanced planning for another possible wave of infections credit authorship contribution statement muhammad tariq khan conceptualization

13504,the ball milling of carbon based materials with nanoparticles is currently emerging as a promising cost effective alternative method of producing nanocomposites with great surface characteristics biochar based nanocomposites are effective in the adsorption of heavy metals dyes and emerging organic contaminants in water and wastewater because of the combined benefits of biochar and nanoparticles contaminants of emerging concern are increasingly being detected in the environment and there is therefore an urgent need to develop nanotechnology based multifunctional and highly efficient processes that can remove a wide range of these chemicalsmost of which are persistent and may bioaccumulate to date not many reviews are available on the use of the ball milling method for engineering biochar based nanocomposites ball milling solid state synthesis is a process extensively used in industry to synthesize nanomaterials ball milling process produces small particle size as small as 10 microns coupled with the advantages of continuous operation thus this review article aims to provide an overview of the efficiencies of the ball milled biochar nanoparticle composite ball milling approach improves the physicochemical properties of biochar and biochar nanoparticle composite such as total and micropore surface of biochar which in turns enhance their sorption abilities different adsorption mechanisms of biochar and modified biochar have been reported which include physisorption chemisorption ion exchange pore filling hydrophobic effects and π π electron donor acceptor π π eda interactions keywords ball milled biochar biochar nanoparticle composite nanomaterials modification of biochar nanoparticles 1 introduction the ever increasing range of contaminants in water bodies and their potentially harmful impact on the environment has now become a universal issue 1 the increase in the number of pollutants occurring in the environment is due to the combined effects of both natural processes and human activities it seems that the range of currently regulated chemical pollutants represents only a fraction of the total chemical pollution the gradual detection and identification of new emerging contaminates further increases the long list of chemical pollutants emerging contaminants ecs are synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals and their transformation products that are not commonly monitored in the environment they include compounds such as pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps pesticides veterinary medicines persistent organic pollutants pops nanomaterials endocrine disrupting compounds edcs paints or coatings steroids hormones surfactants and surfactant metabolites flame retardants industrial additives and gasoline additives among these ppcps remain the major group of emerging contaminants ecs that have been detected within the diverse surface waters 2 4 even though most of these compounds are generally detected at low and considerable level of concentrations they are still of great concern as pharmaceutical drugs can produce biological effects at a very low level some of the reported negative effects at low concentrations of ppcps include significant renal degenerative necrotic changes and chronic toxicity on vertebrates 5 6 these compoundsalso have the potential to enter the environment and cause known or suspected adverse ecological and or human health effects yet their ecotoxicological effects are not known 7 as shown in fig 1 they may enter the aquatic environment through various routes e g agricultural runoff wastewater treatment plant effluents application of sewage sludge to land and landfill leachate due to disposal of unused medicines 8 additionally up to 60 90 of the major compounds are discharged into water bodies in their parent and metabolite forms owing to the animal body only partially metabolising these compounds 9 antibiotics are amongst the most frequently detected group of compounds and they are of great concern because of their potential contribution to the emergency of antibiotic resistance genes args in the bacterial ecosystem which is easily transferred to other bacteria 10 once the args developed in bacteria theycause the microbes to become resistant to conventional antibiotic drugs which had been effective 11 these drug resistant bacteria are mainly found in hospital effluents where antibiotics are frequently used this has called for serious attention of researchers in the advancement of effective and eco friendly methods for the detection and monitoring of the broad range of these compounds as well as to develop a techno economic model to assess the quality and quantity of these emerging contaminants and their removal from water 12 most conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps were not designed to remove these emerging contaminants as a result these contaminants end up in the environment and may pose a threat to human beings and aquatic animals 13 the current water treatment methods employed in the removal of pollutants from water are chemical precipitation ion exchange and adsorption amongst others the modern advanced water treatment methods such as the advanced oxidation process aop and nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro membrane technology have been proven to be effective for the removal of contaminants but most of these methods are very costly and sometimes generate secondary chemical pollutants 14 there is a need for more effective eco friendly low cost methods that will rely on readily available materials to cater for the new class of these emerging contaminants 15 adsorption remains the most suitable technique because of the simplicity of the design its low cost and being efficient in the removal of pollutants but the choice of a suitable adsorbent is a major determinant of the adsorption efficiency 16 biochar has a highly porous structure large specific surface area rich in surface functional groups and inorganic elements that facilitate the effective adsorption of different contaminants from water 17 hence biochar bc has been considered a promising alternative adsorbent in water treatment 18 the inherent drawbackof some pristine biochar which has low aromaticity and low sorption capacity for contaminants 19 has paved the way for the improvement of biochar by producing biochar based composites i e using biochar as the supporting material to anchor different nanomaterials biochar engineering with different nanomaterials improves its surface active sites functional groups ease of separation and new biochar based nanocomposites have shown to be promising 20 therefore this review will focus on the improvement of the natural adsorbent biochar its modification engineering process with othernanocomposites and its application on the removal of ecs a search on web of science supplementary data 1 a using the keywords ball milling and biochar composite was done covering the period 2010 2020 i e 10 years the search revealed 29 publications which were published between 2015 and 2020 of which 26 were research articles two were proceedings while one was a review article published in 2019 22 similarly science direct supplementary data 1 b was also searched using the same keywords and 52 publications were found of which only one was a recent review article june 2020 23 that focused on ball milling process for fabrication of novel biochar nanomaterials and the rest were research articles this shows that there is a need for increased research on comprehensive review articles on the ball milling method for fabrication of biochar composites when the same keywords were used on scifinder supplementary data1 c a total of 37 publications were retrieved among them 36 were research articles which focused on the ball milling process for biochar composites for different applications while only one was a review article published in december 2019 24 the review article was mainly focused on ball milling method for synthesising biochar iron bc fe composites the recent report by xiang et al 25 shows that ball milling of biochar enhances the surface properties and increases the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for the removal of volatile organic compounds vocs more recently yuan et al 26 in their comparative study foundwet and dry ball milling processes to have significantly improvedthe specific surface area of the ball milled biochar by 200 times of the pristine biochar but no significant variation was reported between the two processes to the best of the authors knowledge only a few review articles have been published on the ball milling synthesis of biochar based nanocomposites for water treatment applications therefore there is a need to review discuss and propose the use of the ball milling process for the engineering of biochar with different composites in this review different methods for the production of biochar will be discussed several modification methods physical and chemical as well as the ball milling method will be briefly discussed and the application of biochar and biochar based nanocomposites will be reviewed and summarised thereafter the conclusion will follow as well as recommendations for further research on the removal of emerging contaminants 2 biochar biochar known for its high carbon content is obtained by thermal treatment of agricultural wastes and biomass in the absence or limited amount of oxygen usually formed ata temperature between 400 700 c 27 generally the physicochemical properties of biochar are as a function of the different types of the biomass sources thermal treatment temperature the furnace setting parameters the type of pyrolysis process involved and the rate of pyrolysis 28 initially biochar was utilised extensively in soil remediation by improving soil properties 29 until recently biochar has been a promising alternative of a low cost adsorbent for the efficient removal of various contaminants from water and wastewater 14 20 28 30 46 although there are limited similarities between activated carbon and biochar owing to their method of production the major chemical distinctive difference is that biochar possesses a higher number of functional groups than the activated carbon 47 despite minor limitations activated carbon has been used successfullyfor the removal of water pollutants the cost of producing activated carbon is higher than that for biochar due to higher energy consumption of the former 48 therefore being environmentally friendly cost effective to produce from readily available agricultural waste materials and with proven adsorption capacity biochar is an indispensable potential source of a new natural adsorbent for the removal of various contaminants from water and wastewater during water treatment 32 49 2 1 production of biochar biochar a stable carbon rich product obtained by pyrolysis of carbonaceous materials can be produced on a scale ranging from large industrial facilities to individual farms 50 a more detailed discussion on the production of biochar can be found elsewhere 51 fig 2 shows the three main products that result from the thermal treatment of biomass biogas bio oil and biochar 2 2 pyrolysis of biochar pyrolysis encompasses diverse thermal degradation of various biomass materials in the absence of oxygen in which such a process produces charcoal as the main product 52 pyrolysis is regarded as the best alternative method of treating biomass to obtain biochar not only because it can be achieved within a very short period but alsothat it can be employed in the production of other products such as syngas bio oil and biochar 53 generally the time taken for the feedstocks to be decomposed the temperature of the furnace and the heating rate and heat transfer rates in the furnace are the major factors that determine whether pyrolysis is a fast or a slow process 54 55 the summary of the four most common pyrolysis methods such as fast pyrolysis slow pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonisation and torrefaction is shown in table 1 slow pyrolysis is referred to as conventional pyrolysis and the chemical transformation of biomass from such a process is not well characterised at relatively low temperatures it always occurs at a temperature between 450 500 c when the biomass is slowly and thermally treated for longer than a few minutes and characterised by the slow effervescence of gaseous vapour from the biomass during conventional pyrolysis 56 this process is usually associated with a high yield of biochar and is environmentally friendly because it leads to the lower release of toxic gases into the ecosystem which has made it widely acceptable as eco friendly and sustainable 57 biochar produced using slow pyrolysis has been reported to be useful in soil remediation and for the sorption of various contaminants from water and wastewater 58 fast pyrolysis involves the rapid thermal treatment of biomass usually with low moisture content 10 over a very short period usually within seconds it occurs at a temperature ranging between 850 1250 c and the biochar yield produced by this process is always low 59 fast pyrolysis is popularly employed in the production of bio oil and it has also been found useful in numerous applications such as manufacturing of food additives and other chemicals 60 61 torrefaction treatment is carried out with the sole purpose of improving the physicochemical properties of biomass it is implemented in the absence of oxygen under atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of about 200 300 c 62 the torrefaction process is regarded as a mild pyrolysis because it is the process whereby hemicellulose known for its high reactivity is decomposed and its lower heating standards are maintained 63 3 modification of biochar to further improve the surface properties of biochar after pyrolysis itcan be modified generally by physical and or chemical modification over the years the chemical modification methods have remained the most universally employed methods such as the acidic alkaline modification of biochar metal salt modification or modification with oxidising reagents these methods have been reported to greatly improve the physicochemical properties of the modified biochar 64 physical modification methods are not commonly used and they involve team activation and gas purging in summary modifications with an acidic solution are reported to bring about more oxygen containing functional groups whereas alkaline modification generates more aromaticity on modified biochar 65 to improve the adsorption efficiency of biochar many researchers have employed different modification methods such as biochar impregnated with magnetic iron nanoparticles which has been reported as effective in the adsorption of arsenic v from solution with ease of separation after usage 66 the metal oxide modification was reported to increase the electrical conductivity of the modified biochar composites 67 virtually all modification and incorporation methods involved in producing engineered biochar with nanomaterials and other carbon composites have depended solely on the use of chemicals for modification activation and functioning aside from the fact that it is a costly method the high chances of re introduction of toxic waste from the chemicals used isa cause for concern not much attention has been focused as yet on the use of physical modification methods for producing engineered biochar with improved physicochemical and surface properties 68 mechanochemistry also known as mechanical chemistry is a method of mixing two or more solids or solid liquid under the influence of mechanical force without the use of chemicals 69 3 1 acidic modification of biochar the acidic modification involves treatment of biochar after pyrolysis with acidic solutions such as hydrochloric acid phosphoric acid oxalic acid nitric acid and citric acid this process changes the surface properties of biochar to aid their sorption capabilities of organic and inorganic contaminants from water and wastewater 28 it has been reported that the corrosive nature of h3po4 alters the elemental composition functional groups as well as the surface area which enhances the adsorptive capacity of the adsorbent for the removal of pb2 and cd2 70 the authors also found that the concentration of the acidic solution used in the modification can greatly alter the surface area characteristics of the biochar whichincreased significantly from 58 75 88 35 m2 g after treatment with 1 m hydrochloric acid as confirmed by bet surface analysis when 2 of sulphuric acid was used for the modification of biochar derived from rice straw a small reduction in the surface area from 71 35 56 9 m2 g was observed 71 the corrosive nature of the acid and concentration can either increase or reduce the surface area of the acid modified biochar as reported by ahsan et al 72 the h2so4 acid modified tea leaves biochar was successfully used as an adsorbent for the removal of sulfamethoxazole and bisphenol a supplementary data 2 it is therefore important to optimise both the type and concentration of the acid to establishthe conditions that will increase functional groups such as carboxyl groups as well as the specific surface area 73 3 2 alkaline modification of biochar the alkaline modification involves the use of a basic solution to change the structure of biochar before or after pyrolysis most basic solutions that were reported for this modification are sodium hydroxide naoh and potassium hydroxide koh solution for example biochar treated with 2 m potassium hydroxide 74 increases the adsorption of as v contaminant from 24 49 to 30 98 mg g which represents an increase of 79 compared to that of the pristine biochar this phenomenon was attributed to the improvement of the specific surface area of the modified biochar 75 potassium hydroxide koh was reportedly used for the activation of sewage sludge in the koh sludge ratio of 1 1 which significantly enhanced the surface area to1900 m2 g 76 3 3 steam activation the steam activation method is one of the most prominent physical methods of biochar modification that is usually employed to enhance porosity specific surface area and aids the removal of impurities on the surface such as ash organic matter and products of incomplete combustion this process involves subjecting pyrolysed biochar to incomplete gasification in the presence of steam as an activating agent which leads to the disintegration of some structure of the material and forms crystalline carbon the main mechanism of steam activation is breaking the vapour that produces oxygen which then reacts with free carbon on the surface of the materials to form co and h2 see eq 1 the hydrogen released in the process then reacts and combines with carbon to produce a weakly bound carbon hydrogen complex see eq 2 further oxidation of the surface continues to produce co2 and hydrogen gas h2 77 1 c h2o co h2 2 2c h2 2ch 3 co h2o co2 h2 continuous repetition of this process increases the surface area owing to the opening of the pores embedded in the carbon structure 78 wang et al 79 reported the steam activation of biochar sbc at 500 c for 45 min which showed promising results for the effective removal of tetracycline tc and cu2 the highest sorption uptake of pb2 195 mg g was reported for steam activated canola straw based biochar compared to the uptake of non steam activated canola and wheat straw based biochar with 108 mg g and 109 mg g respectively 80 an investigation by rajapaksha et al 81 also confirmed the enhancement of the sorption capacity of steam activated biochar of sicyos angulatusl with a 53 increase in sorption efficiencies compared to non activated biochar derived using the same operating condition however shim et al 82 suggested that steam activation of biochar may not be appropriate for effective sorption and reduction of toxicity of copper this process was reported to induce toxicity which may be due to an increase in aromaticity imposed by steam activation 3 4 modification of biochar with nanomaterials engineering of biochar with nanomaterials could lead to the formation of remarkable biochar based nanocomposites which would have combined advantages of both materials 20 production of biochar based nanocomposites overcomes the drawbacksof limited adsorption of pollutants from an aqueous solution when usingpristine biochar 19 biochar based nanocomposites can be produced mainly by the following two methods 1 incorporating nano metal or their hydroxide 2 pre treatment of biomass or post treatment of the pyrolysed biochar with the metal salt 3 4 1 biochar based nanocomposites combining the advantages of nanomaterials with the availability of many functional groups in pyrolysed biochar such as hydroxyl oh carboxyl cooh groups and amino acids can lead to an improvement in the biochar nanocomposite characteristics these functional groups play a significant role in the application of biochar especially in the area of water purification for the removal of contaminants moreover the inherent large specific surface area which is a result of both the nanomaterial and the biochar characteristics makes the nanocomposites more efficient researchers have investigated the incorporation of nanomaterials into biochar and found that this process enhanced its physicochemical properties the findings brought about a breakthrough to inherent limitations in the use of pristine biochar thereby addressing the challenges of application of biochar for water and wastewater purification 31 83 86 however concerns have been expressed about the stability of these biochar based nanocomposites after usage as some of the nanomaterials incorporated in the matrix could leach out into treated water if not tethered properly to overcome these drawbacks the uses of magnetic biochar nanocomposites have been explored this approach could allow the easy separation of the magnetic nanocomposite even with an ordinary magnet with the added advantage of recycling the nanocomposites after use it was reported that the magnetite biochar nanocomposite synthesised by pre treatment of biomass with fecl3 composites possessed outstanding ferromagnetism properties which made the composite capable of adsorbing arsenic contaminants 87 development of biochar embedded with carbon nanotubes was also reported the combination of the high surface area of biochar and the cnts made it possible for cnt biochar composites to have a very high surface area of 359 m2 g and higher contaminant sorption efficiency a similar result was observed when wheat straw biomass waste was pre treated with graphene through a slow pyrolysis method and the graphene coated on the surface of the biochar improved the surface characteristics additional functional groups were introduced and excellent adsorption of phenanthrene and mercury contaminants was reported compared with the low sorption properties shown by the pristine biochar due to the above mentioned breakthrough the attention of researchers was drawn to the use of functionalised biochar based magnetic nanocomposites 88 3 4 2 biochar based nanocomposites from metal oxides or metal salts functionalising biochar with metal oxides or metal salts could significantly improve its adsorption capacity catalytic and magnetic properties the development of metal oxide salt biochar nanocomposites became imperative to improve the adsorption capacity for some target contaminants such as anionic dyes as these compounds are not well absorbed owing to the negatively charged surface of pristine biochar 89 metal oxides or salts could be utilised in the synthesis of the metal biochar composite to improve the catalytic properties of the material for the persulfate activation process 90 the most common metals used in metal oxide salt biochar nanocomposites are iron manganese magnesium and aluminium 20 investigation showed that the adsorption capacity of rice husk derived biochar was improved significantly for the removal of as iii and as v when it was coated with iron fe iii 91 liang et al 92 also reported an enhancement in the removal of the heavy metals pb ii and cd ii from aqueous solution when swine derived biochar was modified with mno2 tan et al 18 classified biochar based nanocomposites into three categories as shown in supplementary data 3 the formation of metal oxide hydroxide biochar nanoparticles is shown in supplementary data 3 a where steps 1 and 2 focus on the pre treatment of biomass with metal oxides or salts before pyrolysis while step 3 shows the post treatment by direct incorporation of metal oxides or salts after pyrolysis 18 3 4 3 magnetic biochar composites to enhance the recycleability of biochar modified with iron oxides salts which increased its magnetic properties this allows for the separation of biochar from the water using an ordinary magnet after treatment of wastewater which is usually difficult to achieve due to the small size of biochar an increase in magnetic properties and ease of separation of the adsorbent after usage was reported when marine microalgae biochar was modified with fe3o4 the high adsorption capacity of up to 382 mg g at 30 c for the removal of acid orange 7 from the water was reported 93 similarly enhancement of the catalytic property was observed when zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi were used for the modification of rice husks biochar for the effective removal of trichloroethylene tce with adegradation efficiency of 94 4 94 supplementary data 3 b shows method 1 which is the pre treatment of the material using iron ions to form the magnetic biochar composite method 2 describes the chemical co precipitation of iron ions onto the biochar to form magnetic composite 18 a summary of the various research studies on the application of magnetic composites for the removal of inorganic and organic contaminants is shown in supplementary data 4 3 4 4 biochar based functionalised nanoparticles owing to the great advantages offered by nanomaterials nanotechnology is now being explored as a possible solution in the treatment of wastewater the remarkable properties of materials in the nano range 1 10 9 include large surface area and their outstanding ability to react with a vast number of other substances due to these exceptional characteristics coupled with the ease of separation after usage nanomaterials are regarded as good adsorbents in the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants from contaminated water 109 115 the pollutant removal efficiencies of nanomaterials can be greatly enhanced by modifying these materials with a range of chemical solutions metal and metal oxides and with other synthesised and natural materials to improve their sorption ability 116 therefore incorporation of nanomaterials such as graphene carbon nanotubes chitosan and zns nanocrystals into adsorbent surface architecture could bring about an affordable composite with higher sorption efficiencies for various contaminants this modification combines the many advantages of biochar and the properties of functionalised nanomaterials 20 in supplementary data 3 c method 1 indicates the pre coating of biomass with the functionalised nanoparticles before pyrolysis to form biochar based nanocomposites while method 2 describes the direct impregnation of the material with the nanoparticles after pyrolysis table 2 summarises the various research studies on the application of biochar based nanocomposites 4 application of biochar in the removal of contaminants extensive research has been conducted on biochar and modified biochar which demonstrates the effective removal of both organic and inorganic contaminants moreover it has been shown that there is a need for more research focuses on improvements in production and modification of biochar for continuous and sustainable application for water and wastewater treatment processes 4 1 biochar application in the removal of inorganic pollutants accumulation of inorganic pollutants in water bodies and the waste sludge has become a serious health issue the heavy metals as cd cr cu hg pb and zn 130 are known for their persistence in the ecosystem they are very reactive even at low concentration and they can accumulate easily in food web thereby becoming potential health risk to humans and aquatic organisms removal of these heavy metals is challenging because of their high solubility 131 all biochar feedstock sources have been proven to be effective in the removal of heavy metal ions although with different sorption capacities biochar derived from rice husk was reported to be effective in the removal of heavy metals in the contaminated water although researchers have shown that biochar derived from organic manure was more effective in adsorption of pb cu zn and cd than biochar derived from other feedstocks 132 similarly biochar obtained from mealworm pyrolysed at 600 c was reported to show excellent adsorption of toxic heavy metals pb ii cd ii cu ii zn ii and cr iii the biochar was reported to have the highest adsorption efficiencies for all these five heavy metal ions the langmuir adsorption isotherm model best described the adsorption process 133 4 1 1 influence of biochar properties on sorption mechanism of inorganic contaminant many mechanisms have been proposed for the sorption of various contaminants using biochar as an adsorbent 34 89 134 145 supplementary data 5 the schematic representation of the major mechanisms for the adsorption of inorganic contaminants by biochar is shown in supplementary data 6 multiple adsorption mechanisms for soil remediation were recently reviewed and it was reported that the adsorption of inorganic contaminants by biochar does not always take place through a single adsorption mechanism rather it is a combination of several adsorption mechanisms the adsorption capacity of biochar for inorganic contaminants was reported to be influenced by the properties of the biomass feedstock used and the pyrolysis conditions three main mechanisms are proposed for the adsorption of inorganic contaminants namely 1 chemical adsorption 2 physical adsorption 3 precipitation and 4 ion exchange 64 these four processes are briefly summarised below 4 1 1 1 chemical adsorption chemisorption many studies have reported that chemical sorption is the type of adsorption that occurs when functional groups such as carboxylic phenolic and hydroxylic groups present at the surface of biochar exchange negatively charged ions with positively charged cationic contaminants 146 148 however different conditions in the production of biochar and the types of biomass feedstocks are also a determinant for the adsorption capacity of the material for example the moderate production temperature of about 350 400 c would lead to a high sorption capacity of biochar 149 whereas low sorption capacity is a result of high temperatures this effect might be as a result of the destruction of the surface functional groups such as oxygen containing functional groups which are easily destroyed at elevated temperatures 146 4 1 1 2 physical adsorption physisorption physical adsorption results from the electrostatic and van der waals forces between the many free moving electrons that are associated with aromatic functional groups on the surface of the derived biochar which eventually leads to non covalent interaction with cc aromatic bonds 150 4 1 1 3 precipitation precipitation or co precipitation is regarded as the main mechanism of adsorption of inorganic pollutants especially metal cations by biochar and its composites it results in the formation of a solid on the surface of the adsorbent biochar or in the solvent during the adsorption process it has been reported that alkali modified biochar obtained by thermal treatment of hemicellulose and cellulose possesses high yield when the temperature is around 300 c 151 such biochar obtained from the same heat treatment conditions enhances the effectiveness of precipitation of inorganic pollutants in different forms of insoluble precipitates 151 the co precipitation effectiveness of biochars obtained from plants and animal feedstocks have been attributed availability of active site on the surface of biochar or electrostatic interactions between cationic species and negatively charged functional groups on biochar s surface 152 4 1 1 4 ion exchange the exchange of ions is an efficient method to separate heavy metals from wastewater it is a reversible chemical reaction in which the elimination of heavy metals is carried out by replacing the resin ions for those in the wastewater different ions of a similar charge in solids are replaced in ion exchange by ions of positive charges cations and negative charges anions from the solvent aqueous solution the ion exchanger involves permanently known opposite charge type functional groups 153 the binding surface sites of biochar can easily allow the adsorption of cationic contaminant to be separated by an ion exchange mechanism the adsorption mechanism of the cations cu2 ag and biochar in an aqueous solution was investigated and a decrease in ph of the solution was noted during the reaction this confirmed the exchange of ions between both acidic functional groups of biochar and the ions of the other species in the solution during the reaction 154 4 2 application of biochar in the removal of organic pollutants several researchers have reported the removal of various organic contaminants using biochar such as 4 nitrotoluene 162 rhodamine b rhb dye 163 17β estradiol e2 164 methylene blue 165 sulfamethoxazole 166 and bisphenol a bpa and sulfamethoxazole 167 the various adsorption capacity of different biochars in the removal of organic pollutants are summarised in table 3 4 2 1 effect of biochar properties on the mechanisms of adsorption of organic contaminants the adsorption mechanism of organic contaminants on biochar is also not a single mechanism but involves a combination of several adsorption mechanisms such as ion exchange interaction electrostatic interaction pore filling and hydrophobic interaction the different adsorption mechanisms for organic contaminants by biochar are summarised in supplementary data 7 5 ball milling of biochar ball milling is a simple non equilibrium solid state process that utilises the opportunity of the dynamic energy of moving balls in the machine to grind break and produce a new improved surface by continuously mixing and grinding the input materials 186 188 it is a highly efficient and cost effective technique for biochar modification 189 ball milling is becoming an emerging method for the synthesis of nanomaterials and is being recognised as a low cost method for enhancing the physicochemical properties of pristine biochar as shown in fig 4 the process reduces the grain size of the materials and greatly improves the surface characteristics of newly synthesised materials 190 191 acidic modification alkaline modification chemical pre treatment steam activation and ball milling are popular conventional methods for biochar modification among all these methods the ball milling method is now considered a green technology for the modification of pristine biochar 192 5 1 mechanism of ball milling ball milling is a mechanical chemical process mcp which utilises mechanical energy to induce chemical and structural changes on materials it has been shown that mechanical energy activation of chemical reactions can lead to many fascinating applications 194 for a grinding ball at the upper point of the grinding chamber the critical rotational speed is determined by assuming that the centrifugal force is equal to the gravity acting on the grinding body it does not consider the influence of force fig 3 b which shows the cohesion between the grinding ball and the inner wall of the chamber the boundary condition for its separation from the wall and its beginning to decline can be written as 4 mg ncosα f c c o s α f c s i n α where n is the support reaction force that is maximal when the grinding body passes the bottom point of the reactor and minimal in its top point fc is the centrifugal force the main principle of ball milling is as follows in a cylinder rotating around its central axis many grinding balls and the material being grounded are loaded the balls continue pushing and grinding the material due to the impact of contact between the cylinder walls and the milling balls in the ball milling process the main type of mechanical impact depends on rotation speed fig 3c e the grinding bodies roll over at slow rotational speeds and the main mechanism of mechanical movement is abrasion fig 3c the grinding bodies are separated from the wall at the highest point of trajectory and dropped as the rotational speed is raised fig 3d the grinding bodies are spread around the walls and roll as the rotational speed is further increased allowing the raw material to undergo abrasion again but with a lower efficiency fig 3e 195 the ball milling process results in the reduction of the size of particles and improve the specific surface area ssa adding new active edge sites to enhance the ability of adsorption of the ball milled materials 196 5 2 application of ball milled biochar the concept of utilising ball milled biochar for contaminant sorption is new and to the best of the authors knowledge only limited research has been reported on the application of this method it has been reported that thiol modified biochar chemical impregnation showed a removal efficiency of 175 6 mg g for hg2 and 58 0 mg g for ch3hg while ball milled biochar showed a removal efficiency of 320 1 mg g for hg2 and 104 9 mg g for ch3hg this represented an increase of 54 86 for hg2 and 55 29 for ch3hg respectively when pristine and ball milled biochar was used to remove ch3hg the removal efficiency was 8 21 and 105 7 mg g respectively the observed higher removal efficiency of ch3hg was due to the improved large surface area and the enhanced negatively charged surface after the ball milling process 197 in a similar study four different bcs modified using the ball milling process showed high specific surface area pore sizes pore and micropore volumes compared to the unmodified non ball milled these modified materials resulted in high efficiency in the removal of reactive dye and co2 198 a similar behaviour was observed when ball milled sugarcane based biochar was compared with unmodified biochar in the removal of methylene blue 199 from the results it was observed that the ball milled biochar hadenhanced surface properties and more oxygen containing functional groups the methylene blue removal efficiency of 354 mg g was reported for the ball milled sugarcane based biochar as compared with 17 2 mg g for the unmodified biochar 199 furthermore the effect of ball milling on the sorption capacity of biochar was studied by zhanget al 200 for removal of galaxolide hhcb from aqueous solution with ball milled biochar bm biochar the adsorption capacity of 330 746 and 609 2098 mg kg 1 of hhcb was observed for raw biochar and ball milled biochar respectively the increase in sorption capacity of the ball milled biochar could be due to the increase in the inner and outer pore of the surface of the biochar in 2017 naghdi et al 192 reported a green approach for biochar modification which resulted in ball milled magnetic biochar fe3o4 biochar based nanocomposite with increased adsorption capacity for the removal of carbamazepine from water an enhanced sorption efficiency of ball milled biochar for hg2 and tetracycline pollutants has been reported as shown schematically in the fig 5 recently xiao et al 201 reported improvements in the physicochemical properties of micro nano sized ball milled biochar based composites derived from cow waste bone produced at 600 c for the removal of the following heavy metals pb ii cd ii and cu ii ball milling coupled with elevated pyrolysis temperature resulted in the synthesis of micro nano engineered sized and high surface area biochar composites ball milled nano biochar nbc with the surface area of 28 m2 g showed higher sorption capacities of 922 7 46 520 and 83 mg g for the removal of cd ii chromium cr vi oxytetracycline otc and glyphosate gl respectively 202 thus future research studies should follow a pragmatic approach and pay attention to this low cost eco friendly and simple modification comparison of adsorption capacity between un ball milled biochar ubmb and ball milled biochar bmb for various contaminants are also summarised in table 4 5 3 application of ball milled biochar nanocomposite incorporating nanomaterials in a highly porous structurally stable surface active biochar provides unique nanocomposites that consolidate the well known benefits of both materials the outstanding abilities of these nanocomposites for contaminant adsorption have attracted the attention of the scientific community 85 specifically immobilization of nano sized materials on the surface of biochar is a research subject of scientific importance it can increase its surface area and increase its high affinity adsorption sites thermal stability and or cation exchange capability by integrating functional nanoparticles into the biochar recently wan et al 209 enumerated methods of enhancing the integration of nanoparticles into biochar other studies have identified multiple methods of incorporation that significantly improve the production of engineered biochar as an adsorbent for a broad range of trace metals 83 metalloids 210 dyes 88 and nutrients such as phosphate and nitrate 211 in the study by wang et al it is reported that in all the applications evaluated engineered biochar with immobilized nanoparticles gave better results than raw biochar 212 ball milled engineered biochar vermiculite nanocomposite showed a high adsorption capacity for as v from the solution than the pristine biochar 209 the characterization of these adsorbents revealed that a greater surface area pore volume and significant improvements in crystallinity cation activation and improved functional groups in the nanocomposite enhanced as v adsorption in another research the matrix of iron sulfide and biochar was used to successfully synthesize magnetic biochar nanocomposite fes bc by mechanical ball milling the resultant nanocomposite was used in the presence of persulfate for the oxidative degradation of tetracycline tc 213 the characterization results indicated that it is possible to synthesize fes bc which has small particle size the ball milled fes bc also demonstrated adequate ferromagnetism the maximum percentage removal recorded was 87 4 at optimum conditions li et al reported the synthesis of magnetic nano biochar from wheat straw and fecl2 fecl3 using impregnation pyrolysis integrated procedure 214 the synthesised pristine magnetic biochar pmbc at different temperature was then ball milled to enhance the surface characteristics of the nano biochar the ball milled magnetic biochar bmbc showed high oxygen content on the surface of the nano biochar treated at different temperature than the corresponding pmbc moreover ball milling effectively increased the surface area of the magnetic nano biochar which resulted in effective removal 99 of tetracycline tc and hg ii in another study ball milling was used to prepare two ultrafine magnetic biochar fe3o4 and activated carbon ac fe3o4 hybrid materials targeted for removal by adsorption and mechanochemical degradation of pharmaceutical compounds 215 both hybrid adsorbents prepared after 2 h of ball milling exhibited high removal efficiency of 62 7 mg g for cbz and 94 2 mg g for tc carbonaceous magnetic adsorbents were synthesised by ball milling biochar bc and activated carbon ac with fe3o4 nanoparticles for the removal of methylene blue from water 216 from the results it is observed that ball milling with magnetite not only improved the surface properties of the carbonaceous adsorbents especially bc but also introduced magnetic properties through mechanical extrusion furthermore ball mill extrusion increased the methylene blue adsorption capacity of bc by 14 fold magnetic ball milled bc had even greater methylene blue adsorption capacity which was 27 fold greater than non ball milled bc the maximum removal capacity of the magnetic ball milled bc mbm bc was 500 5 mg g which is impressive removal efficiency as compared to ball milled biochar adsorbent 218 mg g the high removal efficiency of mbm bc was attributed to its increased surface area opened pore structure functional groups and aromatic cc bonds which promoted π π and electrostatic interactions 216 xiao et al reported the successful synthesis of ball milled graphitic carbon nitride g c 3 n 4 biochar for simultaneous adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of enrofloxacine efa and total organic carbon toc 217 in their study g c 3 n 4 was obtained by a thermal poly condensation reaction of melamine at 550 c the g c 3 n 4 biochar composites were synthesised by ball milling biochar and g c 3 n 4 together the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of efa and toc showed that all the g c 3 n 4 biochar composites displayed higher adsorption and photocatalytic degradation to efa than that of pure g c 3 n 4 the 50 g c 3 n 4 biochar showed best removal efficiency of 45 2 and 81 1 of efa 10 mg l under darkness and light conditions with a dosage of 1 mg ml while g c 3 n 4 alone were 19 0 and 27 3 respectively moreover the highest total organic carbon toc removal efficiency 65 9 was observed using the ball milled 50 g c 3 n 4 biochar nanocomposite in the study reported by zheng et al it is confirmed that ball milling is a promising method of synthesising usable biochar nanocomposite where the method of ball milling was used in the fabrication of dual functional mgo biochar nanocomposite 218 the characterization of the biochar nanocomposite obtained shows reduced size nanoscale and mesoporous structure with mgo nanoparticles evenly distributed on the surface of the biochar at low adsorbent dosages of 1 0 g l and 0 2 g l respectively adsorption experiment resulted in 62 9 percent removal of phosphate and 87 5 percent removal of methylene blue 218 6 conclusions this review focused on the main methods of pyrolysis andmodificationof biochar for its application as an adsorbent for water treatment overall ball milled biochars and biochar nanocomposites have been demonstrated as promising materials for environmental remediation however based on the information gap identified such as the application of physical synthesis method ball milling and the merits of combining biochar with different nanomaterials some recommendations are given herewith future research studies should consider the ball milling of biochar 1 the improved properties of these ball milled biochars were investigated and reported to have improved sorption capacities of various biochars particularly pristine biochar that suffers from low aromaticity 2 green synthesis of nanoparticles should be exploredin future research forthe formation of biochar based nanocomposites to reduce the risk of cross contamination due to the chemicals being used in the preparation of the nanoparticles for drinking and wastewater treatment 3 most of the modifications and applications of biochar have been done at laboratory scale therefore future applications should be extended to the industrial scale 4 the use of ball milled biochar for the removal of both inorganic and organic contaminants is still in the early stages of development and further research is required for abroad understanding of the concept behind the ball milling of biochar 5 agglomeration potential of ball milled biochar is still being debated because biochars are mostly obtained from agricultural waste woods that contain plentiful lignocellulose the lignin does act as a binder during the ball milling process therefore it could increase the agglomeration potential which is one of the major problems of materials in nano scales further research needs to be done on the potential agglomeration of ball milled biochar especially biochar from other feedstock sources from plant wastes declaration of

13504,the ball milling of carbon based materials with nanoparticles is currently emerging as a promising cost effective alternative method of producing nanocomposites with great surface characteristics biochar based nanocomposites are effective in the adsorption of heavy metals dyes and emerging organic contaminants in water and wastewater because of the combined benefits of biochar and nanoparticles contaminants of emerging concern are increasingly being detected in the environment and there is therefore an urgent need to develop nanotechnology based multifunctional and highly efficient processes that can remove a wide range of these chemicalsmost of which are persistent and may bioaccumulate to date not many reviews are available on the use of the ball milling method for engineering biochar based nanocomposites ball milling solid state synthesis is a process extensively used in industry to synthesize nanomaterials ball milling process produces small particle size as small as 10 microns coupled with the advantages of continuous operation thus this review article aims to provide an overview of the efficiencies of the ball milled biochar nanoparticle composite ball milling approach improves the physicochemical properties of biochar and biochar nanoparticle composite such as total and micropore surface of biochar which in turns enhance their sorption abilities different adsorption mechanisms of biochar and modified biochar have been reported which include physisorption chemisorption ion exchange pore filling hydrophobic effects and π π electron donor acceptor π π eda interactions keywords ball milled biochar biochar nanoparticle composite nanomaterials modification of biochar nanoparticles 1 introduction the ever increasing range of contaminants in water bodies and their potentially harmful impact on the environment has now become a universal issue 1 the increase in the number of pollutants occurring in the environment is due to the combined effects of both natural processes and human activities it seems that the range of currently regulated chemical pollutants represents only a fraction of the total chemical pollution the gradual detection and identification of new emerging contaminates further increases the long list of chemical pollutants emerging contaminants ecs are synthetic or naturally occurring chemicals and their transformation products that are not commonly monitored in the environment they include compounds such as pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps pesticides veterinary medicines persistent organic pollutants pops nanomaterials endocrine disrupting compounds edcs paints or coatings steroids hormones surfactants and surfactant metabolites flame retardants industrial additives and gasoline additives among these ppcps remain the major group of emerging contaminants ecs that have been detected within the diverse surface waters 2 4 even though most of these compounds are generally detected at low and considerable level of concentrations they are still of great concern as pharmaceutical drugs can produce biological effects at a very low level some of the reported negative effects at low concentrations of ppcps include significant renal degenerative necrotic changes and chronic toxicity on vertebrates 5 6 these compoundsalso have the potential to enter the environment and cause known or suspected adverse ecological and or human health effects yet their ecotoxicological effects are not known 7 as shown in fig 1 they may enter the aquatic environment through various routes e g agricultural runoff wastewater treatment plant effluents application of sewage sludge to land and landfill leachate due to disposal of unused medicines 8 additionally up to 60 90 of the major compounds are discharged into water bodies in their parent and metabolite forms owing to the animal body only partially metabolising these compounds 9 antibiotics are amongst the most frequently detected group of compounds and they are of great concern because of their potential contribution to the emergency of antibiotic resistance genes args in the bacterial ecosystem which is easily transferred to other bacteria 10 once the args developed in bacteria theycause the microbes to become resistant to conventional antibiotic drugs which had been effective 11 these drug resistant bacteria are mainly found in hospital effluents where antibiotics are frequently used this has called for serious attention of researchers in the advancement of effective and eco friendly methods for the detection and monitoring of the broad range of these compounds as well as to develop a techno economic model to assess the quality and quantity of these emerging contaminants and their removal from water 12 most conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps were not designed to remove these emerging contaminants as a result these contaminants end up in the environment and may pose a threat to human beings and aquatic animals 13 the current water treatment methods employed in the removal of pollutants from water are chemical precipitation ion exchange and adsorption amongst others the modern advanced water treatment methods such as the advanced oxidation process aop and nanofiltration nf reverse osmosis ro membrane technology have been proven to be effective for the removal of contaminants but most of these methods are very costly and sometimes generate secondary chemical pollutants 14 there is a need for more effective eco friendly low cost methods that will rely on readily available materials to cater for the new class of these emerging contaminants 15 adsorption remains the most suitable technique because of the simplicity of the design its low cost and being efficient in the removal of pollutants but the choice of a suitable adsorbent is a major determinant of the adsorption efficiency 16 biochar has a highly porous structure large specific surface area rich in surface functional groups and inorganic elements that facilitate the effective adsorption of different contaminants from water 17 hence biochar bc has been considered a promising alternative adsorbent in water treatment 18 the inherent drawbackof some pristine biochar which has low aromaticity and low sorption capacity for contaminants 19 has paved the way for the improvement of biochar by producing biochar based composites i e using biochar as the supporting material to anchor different nanomaterials biochar engineering with different nanomaterials improves its surface active sites functional groups ease of separation and new biochar based nanocomposites have shown to be promising 20 therefore this review will focus on the improvement of the natural adsorbent biochar its modification engineering process with othernanocomposites and its application on the removal of ecs a search on web of science supplementary data 1 a using the keywords ball milling and biochar composite was done covering the period 2010 2020 i e 10 years the search revealed 29 publications which were published between 2015 and 2020 of which 26 were research articles two were proceedings while one was a review article published in 2019 22 similarly science direct supplementary data 1 b was also searched using the same keywords and 52 publications were found of which only one was a recent review article june 2020 23 that focused on ball milling process for fabrication of novel biochar nanomaterials and the rest were research articles this shows that there is a need for increased research on comprehensive review articles on the ball milling method for fabrication of biochar composites when the same keywords were used on scifinder supplementary data1 c a total of 37 publications were retrieved among them 36 were research articles which focused on the ball milling process for biochar composites for different applications while only one was a review article published in december 2019 24 the review article was mainly focused on ball milling method for synthesising biochar iron bc fe composites the recent report by xiang et al 25 shows that ball milling of biochar enhances the surface properties and increases the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent for the removal of volatile organic compounds vocs more recently yuan et al 26 in their comparative study foundwet and dry ball milling processes to have significantly improvedthe specific surface area of the ball milled biochar by 200 times of the pristine biochar but no significant variation was reported between the two processes to the best of the authors knowledge only a few review articles have been published on the ball milling synthesis of biochar based nanocomposites for water treatment applications therefore there is a need to review discuss and propose the use of the ball milling process for the engineering of biochar with different composites in this review different methods for the production of biochar will be discussed several modification methods physical and chemical as well as the ball milling method will be briefly discussed and the application of biochar and biochar based nanocomposites will be reviewed and summarised thereafter the conclusion will follow as well as recommendations for further research on the removal of emerging contaminants 2 biochar biochar known for its high carbon content is obtained by thermal treatment of agricultural wastes and biomass in the absence or limited amount of oxygen usually formed ata temperature between 400 700 c 27 generally the physicochemical properties of biochar are as a function of the different types of the biomass sources thermal treatment temperature the furnace setting parameters the type of pyrolysis process involved and the rate of pyrolysis 28 initially biochar was utilised extensively in soil remediation by improving soil properties 29 until recently biochar has been a promising alternative of a low cost adsorbent for the efficient removal of various contaminants from water and wastewater 14 20 28 30 46 although there are limited similarities between activated carbon and biochar owing to their method of production the major chemical distinctive difference is that biochar possesses a higher number of functional groups than the activated carbon 47 despite minor limitations activated carbon has been used successfullyfor the removal of water pollutants the cost of producing activated carbon is higher than that for biochar due to higher energy consumption of the former 48 therefore being environmentally friendly cost effective to produce from readily available agricultural waste materials and with proven adsorption capacity biochar is an indispensable potential source of a new natural adsorbent for the removal of various contaminants from water and wastewater during water treatment 32 49 2 1 production of biochar biochar a stable carbon rich product obtained by pyrolysis of carbonaceous materials can be produced on a scale ranging from large industrial facilities to individual farms 50 a more detailed discussion on the production of biochar can be found elsewhere 51 fig 2 shows the three main products that result from the thermal treatment of biomass biogas bio oil and biochar 2 2 pyrolysis of biochar pyrolysis encompasses diverse thermal degradation of various biomass materials in the absence of oxygen in which such a process produces charcoal as the main product 52 pyrolysis is regarded as the best alternative method of treating biomass to obtain biochar not only because it can be achieved within a very short period but alsothat it can be employed in the production of other products such as syngas bio oil and biochar 53 generally the time taken for the feedstocks to be decomposed the temperature of the furnace and the heating rate and heat transfer rates in the furnace are the major factors that determine whether pyrolysis is a fast or a slow process 54 55 the summary of the four most common pyrolysis methods such as fast pyrolysis slow pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonisation and torrefaction is shown in table 1 slow pyrolysis is referred to as conventional pyrolysis and the chemical transformation of biomass from such a process is not well characterised at relatively low temperatures it always occurs at a temperature between 450 500 c when the biomass is slowly and thermally treated for longer than a few minutes and characterised by the slow effervescence of gaseous vapour from the biomass during conventional pyrolysis 56 this process is usually associated with a high yield of biochar and is environmentally friendly because it leads to the lower release of toxic gases into the ecosystem which has made it widely acceptable as eco friendly and sustainable 57 biochar produced using slow pyrolysis has been reported to be useful in soil remediation and for the sorption of various contaminants from water and wastewater 58 fast pyrolysis involves the rapid thermal treatment of biomass usually with low moisture content 10 over a very short period usually within seconds it occurs at a temperature ranging between 850 1250 c and the biochar yield produced by this process is always low 59 fast pyrolysis is popularly employed in the production of bio oil and it has also been found useful in numerous applications such as manufacturing of food additives and other chemicals 60 61 torrefaction treatment is carried out with the sole purpose of improving the physicochemical properties of biomass it is implemented in the absence of oxygen under atmospheric pressure and at a temperature of about 200 300 c 62 the torrefaction process is regarded as a mild pyrolysis because it is the process whereby hemicellulose known for its high reactivity is decomposed and its lower heating standards are maintained 63 3 modification of biochar to further improve the surface properties of biochar after pyrolysis itcan be modified generally by physical and or chemical modification over the years the chemical modification methods have remained the most universally employed methods such as the acidic alkaline modification of biochar metal salt modification or modification with oxidising reagents these methods have been reported to greatly improve the physicochemical properties of the modified biochar 64 physical modification methods are not commonly used and they involve team activation and gas purging in summary modifications with an acidic solution are reported to bring about more oxygen containing functional groups whereas alkaline modification generates more aromaticity on modified biochar 65 to improve the adsorption efficiency of biochar many researchers have employed different modification methods such as biochar impregnated with magnetic iron nanoparticles which has been reported as effective in the adsorption of arsenic v from solution with ease of separation after usage 66 the metal oxide modification was reported to increase the electrical conductivity of the modified biochar composites 67 virtually all modification and incorporation methods involved in producing engineered biochar with nanomaterials and other carbon composites have depended solely on the use of chemicals for modification activation and functioning aside from the fact that it is a costly method the high chances of re introduction of toxic waste from the chemicals used isa cause for concern not much attention has been focused as yet on the use of physical modification methods for producing engineered biochar with improved physicochemical and surface properties 68 mechanochemistry also known as mechanical chemistry is a method of mixing two or more solids or solid liquid under the influence of mechanical force without the use of chemicals 69 3 1 acidic modification of biochar the acidic modification involves treatment of biochar after pyrolysis with acidic solutions such as hydrochloric acid phosphoric acid oxalic acid nitric acid and citric acid this process changes the surface properties of biochar to aid their sorption capabilities of organic and inorganic contaminants from water and wastewater 28 it has been reported that the corrosive nature of h3po4 alters the elemental composition functional groups as well as the surface area which enhances the adsorptive capacity of the adsorbent for the removal of pb2 and cd2 70 the authors also found that the concentration of the acidic solution used in the modification can greatly alter the surface area characteristics of the biochar whichincreased significantly from 58 75 88 35 m2 g after treatment with 1 m hydrochloric acid as confirmed by bet surface analysis when 2 of sulphuric acid was used for the modification of biochar derived from rice straw a small reduction in the surface area from 71 35 56 9 m2 g was observed 71 the corrosive nature of the acid and concentration can either increase or reduce the surface area of the acid modified biochar as reported by ahsan et al 72 the h2so4 acid modified tea leaves biochar was successfully used as an adsorbent for the removal of sulfamethoxazole and bisphenol a supplementary data 2 it is therefore important to optimise both the type and concentration of the acid to establishthe conditions that will increase functional groups such as carboxyl groups as well as the specific surface area 73 3 2 alkaline modification of biochar the alkaline modification involves the use of a basic solution to change the structure of biochar before or after pyrolysis most basic solutions that were reported for this modification are sodium hydroxide naoh and potassium hydroxide koh solution for example biochar treated with 2 m potassium hydroxide 74 increases the adsorption of as v contaminant from 24 49 to 30 98 mg g which represents an increase of 79 compared to that of the pristine biochar this phenomenon was attributed to the improvement of the specific surface area of the modified biochar 75 potassium hydroxide koh was reportedly used for the activation of sewage sludge in the koh sludge ratio of 1 1 which significantly enhanced the surface area to1900 m2 g 76 3 3 steam activation the steam activation method is one of the most prominent physical methods of biochar modification that is usually employed to enhance porosity specific surface area and aids the removal of impurities on the surface such as ash organic matter and products of incomplete combustion this process involves subjecting pyrolysed biochar to incomplete gasification in the presence of steam as an activating agent which leads to the disintegration of some structure of the material and forms crystalline carbon the main mechanism of steam activation is breaking the vapour that produces oxygen which then reacts with free carbon on the surface of the materials to form co and h2 see eq 1 the hydrogen released in the process then reacts and combines with carbon to produce a weakly bound carbon hydrogen complex see eq 2 further oxidation of the surface continues to produce co2 and hydrogen gas h2 77 1 c h2o co h2 2 2c h2 2ch 3 co h2o co2 h2 continuous repetition of this process increases the surface area owing to the opening of the pores embedded in the carbon structure 78 wang et al 79 reported the steam activation of biochar sbc at 500 c for 45 min which showed promising results for the effective removal of tetracycline tc and cu2 the highest sorption uptake of pb2 195 mg g was reported for steam activated canola straw based biochar compared to the uptake of non steam activated canola and wheat straw based biochar with 108 mg g and 109 mg g respectively 80 an investigation by rajapaksha et al 81 also confirmed the enhancement of the sorption capacity of steam activated biochar of sicyos angulatusl with a 53 increase in sorption efficiencies compared to non activated biochar derived using the same operating condition however shim et al 82 suggested that steam activation of biochar may not be appropriate for effective sorption and reduction of toxicity of copper this process was reported to induce toxicity which may be due to an increase in aromaticity imposed by steam activation 3 4 modification of biochar with nanomaterials engineering of biochar with nanomaterials could lead to the formation of remarkable biochar based nanocomposites which would have combined advantages of both materials 20 production of biochar based nanocomposites overcomes the drawbacksof limited adsorption of pollutants from an aqueous solution when usingpristine biochar 19 biochar based nanocomposites can be produced mainly by the following two methods 1 incorporating nano metal or their hydroxide 2 pre treatment of biomass or post treatment of the pyrolysed biochar with the metal salt 3 4 1 biochar based nanocomposites combining the advantages of nanomaterials with the availability of many functional groups in pyrolysed biochar such as hydroxyl oh carboxyl cooh groups and amino acids can lead to an improvement in the biochar nanocomposite characteristics these functional groups play a significant role in the application of biochar especially in the area of water purification for the removal of contaminants moreover the inherent large specific surface area which is a result of both the nanomaterial and the biochar characteristics makes the nanocomposites more efficient researchers have investigated the incorporation of nanomaterials into biochar and found that this process enhanced its physicochemical properties the findings brought about a breakthrough to inherent limitations in the use of pristine biochar thereby addressing the challenges of application of biochar for water and wastewater purification 31 83 86 however concerns have been expressed about the stability of these biochar based nanocomposites after usage as some of the nanomaterials incorporated in the matrix could leach out into treated water if not tethered properly to overcome these drawbacks the uses of magnetic biochar nanocomposites have been explored this approach could allow the easy separation of the magnetic nanocomposite even with an ordinary magnet with the added advantage of recycling the nanocomposites after use it was reported that the magnetite biochar nanocomposite synthesised by pre treatment of biomass with fecl3 composites possessed outstanding ferromagnetism properties which made the composite capable of adsorbing arsenic contaminants 87 development of biochar embedded with carbon nanotubes was also reported the combination of the high surface area of biochar and the cnts made it possible for cnt biochar composites to have a very high surface area of 359 m2 g and higher contaminant sorption efficiency a similar result was observed when wheat straw biomass waste was pre treated with graphene through a slow pyrolysis method and the graphene coated on the surface of the biochar improved the surface characteristics additional functional groups were introduced and excellent adsorption of phenanthrene and mercury contaminants was reported compared with the low sorption properties shown by the pristine biochar due to the above mentioned breakthrough the attention of researchers was drawn to the use of functionalised biochar based magnetic nanocomposites 88 3 4 2 biochar based nanocomposites from metal oxides or metal salts functionalising biochar with metal oxides or metal salts could significantly improve its adsorption capacity catalytic and magnetic properties the development of metal oxide salt biochar nanocomposites became imperative to improve the adsorption capacity for some target contaminants such as anionic dyes as these compounds are not well absorbed owing to the negatively charged surface of pristine biochar 89 metal oxides or salts could be utilised in the synthesis of the metal biochar composite to improve the catalytic properties of the material for the persulfate activation process 90 the most common metals used in metal oxide salt biochar nanocomposites are iron manganese magnesium and aluminium 20 investigation showed that the adsorption capacity of rice husk derived biochar was improved significantly for the removal of as iii and as v when it was coated with iron fe iii 91 liang et al 92 also reported an enhancement in the removal of the heavy metals pb ii and cd ii from aqueous solution when swine derived biochar was modified with mno2 tan et al 18 classified biochar based nanocomposites into three categories as shown in supplementary data 3 the formation of metal oxide hydroxide biochar nanoparticles is shown in supplementary data 3 a where steps 1 and 2 focus on the pre treatment of biomass with metal oxides or salts before pyrolysis while step 3 shows the post treatment by direct incorporation of metal oxides or salts after pyrolysis 18 3 4 3 magnetic biochar composites to enhance the recycleability of biochar modified with iron oxides salts which increased its magnetic properties this allows for the separation of biochar from the water using an ordinary magnet after treatment of wastewater which is usually difficult to achieve due to the small size of biochar an increase in magnetic properties and ease of separation of the adsorbent after usage was reported when marine microalgae biochar was modified with fe3o4 the high adsorption capacity of up to 382 mg g at 30 c for the removal of acid orange 7 from the water was reported 93 similarly enhancement of the catalytic property was observed when zero valent iron nanoparticles nzvi were used for the modification of rice husks biochar for the effective removal of trichloroethylene tce with adegradation efficiency of 94 4 94 supplementary data 3 b shows method 1 which is the pre treatment of the material using iron ions to form the magnetic biochar composite method 2 describes the chemical co precipitation of iron ions onto the biochar to form magnetic composite 18 a summary of the various research studies on the application of magnetic composites for the removal of inorganic and organic contaminants is shown in supplementary data 4 3 4 4 biochar based functionalised nanoparticles owing to the great advantages offered by nanomaterials nanotechnology is now being explored as a possible solution in the treatment of wastewater the remarkable properties of materials in the nano range 1 10 9 include large surface area and their outstanding ability to react with a vast number of other substances due to these exceptional characteristics coupled with the ease of separation after usage nanomaterials are regarded as good adsorbents in the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants from contaminated water 109 115 the pollutant removal efficiencies of nanomaterials can be greatly enhanced by modifying these materials with a range of chemical solutions metal and metal oxides and with other synthesised and natural materials to improve their sorption ability 116 therefore incorporation of nanomaterials such as graphene carbon nanotubes chitosan and zns nanocrystals into adsorbent surface architecture could bring about an affordable composite with higher sorption efficiencies for various contaminants this modification combines the many advantages of biochar and the properties of functionalised nanomaterials 20 in supplementary data 3 c method 1 indicates the pre coating of biomass with the functionalised nanoparticles before pyrolysis to form biochar based nanocomposites while method 2 describes the direct impregnation of the material with the nanoparticles after pyrolysis table 2 summarises the various research studies on the application of biochar based nanocomposites 4 application of biochar in the removal of contaminants extensive research has been conducted on biochar and modified biochar which demonstrates the effective removal of both organic and inorganic contaminants moreover it has been shown that there is a need for more research focuses on improvements in production and modification of biochar for continuous and sustainable application for water and wastewater treatment processes 4 1 biochar application in the removal of inorganic pollutants accumulation of inorganic pollutants in water bodies and the waste sludge has become a serious health issue the heavy metals as cd cr cu hg pb and zn 130 are known for their persistence in the ecosystem they are very reactive even at low concentration and they can accumulate easily in food web thereby becoming potential health risk to humans and aquatic organisms removal of these heavy metals is challenging because of their high solubility 131 all biochar feedstock sources have been proven to be effective in the removal of heavy metal ions although with different sorption capacities biochar derived from rice husk was reported to be effective in the removal of heavy metals in the contaminated water although researchers have shown that biochar derived from organic manure was more effective in adsorption of pb cu zn and cd than biochar derived from other feedstocks 132 similarly biochar obtained from mealworm pyrolysed at 600 c was reported to show excellent adsorption of toxic heavy metals pb ii cd ii cu ii zn ii and cr iii the biochar was reported to have the highest adsorption efficiencies for all these five heavy metal ions the langmuir adsorption isotherm model best described the adsorption process 133 4 1 1 influence of biochar properties on sorption mechanism of inorganic contaminant many mechanisms have been proposed for the sorption of various contaminants using biochar as an adsorbent 34 89 134 145 supplementary data 5 the schematic representation of the major mechanisms for the adsorption of inorganic contaminants by biochar is shown in supplementary data 6 multiple adsorption mechanisms for soil remediation were recently reviewed and it was reported that the adsorption of inorganic contaminants by biochar does not always take place through a single adsorption mechanism rather it is a combination of several adsorption mechanisms the adsorption capacity of biochar for inorganic contaminants was reported to be influenced by the properties of the biomass feedstock used and the pyrolysis conditions three main mechanisms are proposed for the adsorption of inorganic contaminants namely 1 chemical adsorption 2 physical adsorption 3 precipitation and 4 ion exchange 64 these four processes are briefly summarised below 4 1 1 1 chemical adsorption chemisorption many studies have reported that chemical sorption is the type of adsorption that occurs when functional groups such as carboxylic phenolic and hydroxylic groups present at the surface of biochar exchange negatively charged ions with positively charged cationic contaminants 146 148 however different conditions in the production of biochar and the types of biomass feedstocks are also a determinant for the adsorption capacity of the material for example the moderate production temperature of about 350 400 c would lead to a high sorption capacity of biochar 149 whereas low sorption capacity is a result of high temperatures this effect might be as a result of the destruction of the surface functional groups such as oxygen containing functional groups which are easily destroyed at elevated temperatures 146 4 1 1 2 physical adsorption physisorption physical adsorption results from the electrostatic and van der waals forces between the many free moving electrons that are associated with aromatic functional groups on the surface of the derived biochar which eventually leads to non covalent interaction with cc aromatic bonds 150 4 1 1 3 precipitation precipitation or co precipitation is regarded as the main mechanism of adsorption of inorganic pollutants especially metal cations by biochar and its composites it results in the formation of a solid on the surface of the adsorbent biochar or in the solvent during the adsorption process it has been reported that alkali modified biochar obtained by thermal treatment of hemicellulose and cellulose possesses high yield when the temperature is around 300 c 151 such biochar obtained from the same heat treatment conditions enhances the effectiveness of precipitation of inorganic pollutants in different forms of insoluble precipitates 151 the co precipitation effectiveness of biochars obtained from plants and animal feedstocks have been attributed availability of active site on the surface of biochar or electrostatic interactions between cationic species and negatively charged functional groups on biochar s surface 152 4 1 1 4 ion exchange the exchange of ions is an efficient method to separate heavy metals from wastewater it is a reversible chemical reaction in which the elimination of heavy metals is carried out by replacing the resin ions for those in the wastewater different ions of a similar charge in solids are replaced in ion exchange by ions of positive charges cations and negative charges anions from the solvent aqueous solution the ion exchanger involves permanently known opposite charge type functional groups 153 the binding surface sites of biochar can easily allow the adsorption of cationic contaminant to be separated by an ion exchange mechanism the adsorption mechanism of the cations cu2 ag and biochar in an aqueous solution was investigated and a decrease in ph of the solution was noted during the reaction this confirmed the exchange of ions between both acidic functional groups of biochar and the ions of the other species in the solution during the reaction 154 4 2 application of biochar in the removal of organic pollutants several researchers have reported the removal of various organic contaminants using biochar such as 4 nitrotoluene 162 rhodamine b rhb dye 163 17β estradiol e2 164 methylene blue 165 sulfamethoxazole 166 and bisphenol a bpa and sulfamethoxazole 167 the various adsorption capacity of different biochars in the removal of organic pollutants are summarised in table 3 4 2 1 effect of biochar properties on the mechanisms of adsorption of organic contaminants the adsorption mechanism of organic contaminants on biochar is also not a single mechanism but involves a combination of several adsorption mechanisms such as ion exchange interaction electrostatic interaction pore filling and hydrophobic interaction the different adsorption mechanisms for organic contaminants by biochar are summarised in supplementary data 7 5 ball milling of biochar ball milling is a simple non equilibrium solid state process that utilises the opportunity of the dynamic energy of moving balls in the machine to grind break and produce a new improved surface by continuously mixing and grinding the input materials 186 188 it is a highly efficient and cost effective technique for biochar modification 189 ball milling is becoming an emerging method for the synthesis of nanomaterials and is being recognised as a low cost method for enhancing the physicochemical properties of pristine biochar as shown in fig 4 the process reduces the grain size of the materials and greatly improves the surface characteristics of newly synthesised materials 190 191 acidic modification alkaline modification chemical pre treatment steam activation and ball milling are popular conventional methods for biochar modification among all these methods the ball milling method is now considered a green technology for the modification of pristine biochar 192 5 1 mechanism of ball milling ball milling is a mechanical chemical process mcp which utilises mechanical energy to induce chemical and structural changes on materials it has been shown that mechanical energy activation of chemical reactions can lead to many fascinating applications 194 for a grinding ball at the upper point of the grinding chamber the critical rotational speed is determined by assuming that the centrifugal force is equal to the gravity acting on the grinding body it does not consider the influence of force fig 3 b which shows the cohesion between the grinding ball and the inner wall of the chamber the boundary condition for its separation from the wall and its beginning to decline can be written as 4 mg ncosα f c c o s α f c s i n α where n is the support reaction force that is maximal when the grinding body passes the bottom point of the reactor and minimal in its top point fc is the centrifugal force the main principle of ball milling is as follows in a cylinder rotating around its central axis many grinding balls and the material being grounded are loaded the balls continue pushing and grinding the material due to the impact of contact between the cylinder walls and the milling balls in the ball milling process the main type of mechanical impact depends on rotation speed fig 3c e the grinding bodies roll over at slow rotational speeds and the main mechanism of mechanical movement is abrasion fig 3c the grinding bodies are separated from the wall at the highest point of trajectory and dropped as the rotational speed is raised fig 3d the grinding bodies are spread around the walls and roll as the rotational speed is further increased allowing the raw material to undergo abrasion again but with a lower efficiency fig 3e 195 the ball milling process results in the reduction of the size of particles and improve the specific surface area ssa adding new active edge sites to enhance the ability of adsorption of the ball milled materials 196 5 2 application of ball milled biochar the concept of utilising ball milled biochar for contaminant sorption is new and to the best of the authors knowledge only limited research has been reported on the application of this method it has been reported that thiol modified biochar chemical impregnation showed a removal efficiency of 175 6 mg g for hg2 and 58 0 mg g for ch3hg while ball milled biochar showed a removal efficiency of 320 1 mg g for hg2 and 104 9 mg g for ch3hg this represented an increase of 54 86 for hg2 and 55 29 for ch3hg respectively when pristine and ball milled biochar was used to remove ch3hg the removal efficiency was 8 21 and 105 7 mg g respectively the observed higher removal efficiency of ch3hg was due to the improved large surface area and the enhanced negatively charged surface after the ball milling process 197 in a similar study four different bcs modified using the ball milling process showed high specific surface area pore sizes pore and micropore volumes compared to the unmodified non ball milled these modified materials resulted in high efficiency in the removal of reactive dye and co2 198 a similar behaviour was observed when ball milled sugarcane based biochar was compared with unmodified biochar in the removal of methylene blue 199 from the results it was observed that the ball milled biochar hadenhanced surface properties and more oxygen containing functional groups the methylene blue removal efficiency of 354 mg g was reported for the ball milled sugarcane based biochar as compared with 17 2 mg g for the unmodified biochar 199 furthermore the effect of ball milling on the sorption capacity of biochar was studied by zhanget al 200 for removal of galaxolide hhcb from aqueous solution with ball milled biochar bm biochar the adsorption capacity of 330 746 and 609 2098 mg kg 1 of hhcb was observed for raw biochar and ball milled biochar respectively the increase in sorption capacity of the ball milled biochar could be due to the increase in the inner and outer pore of the surface of the biochar in 2017 naghdi et al 192 reported a green approach for biochar modification which resulted in ball milled magnetic biochar fe3o4 biochar based nanocomposite with increased adsorption capacity for the removal of carbamazepine from water an enhanced sorption efficiency of ball milled biochar for hg2 and tetracycline pollutants has been reported as shown schematically in the fig 5 recently xiao et al 201 reported improvements in the physicochemical properties of micro nano sized ball milled biochar based composites derived from cow waste bone produced at 600 c for the removal of the following heavy metals pb ii cd ii and cu ii ball milling coupled with elevated pyrolysis temperature resulted in the synthesis of micro nano engineered sized and high surface area biochar composites ball milled nano biochar nbc with the surface area of 28 m2 g showed higher sorption capacities of 922 7 46 520 and 83 mg g for the removal of cd ii chromium cr vi oxytetracycline otc and glyphosate gl respectively 202 thus future research studies should follow a pragmatic approach and pay attention to this low cost eco friendly and simple modification comparison of adsorption capacity between un ball milled biochar ubmb and ball milled biochar bmb for various contaminants are also summarised in table 4 5 3 application of ball milled biochar nanocomposite incorporating nanomaterials in a highly porous structurally stable surface active biochar provides unique nanocomposites that consolidate the well known benefits of both materials the outstanding abilities of these nanocomposites for contaminant adsorption have attracted the attention of the scientific community 85 specifically immobilization of nano sized materials on the surface of biochar is a research subject of scientific importance it can increase its surface area and increase its high affinity adsorption sites thermal stability and or cation exchange capability by integrating functional nanoparticles into the biochar recently wan et al 209 enumerated methods of enhancing the integration of nanoparticles into biochar other studies have identified multiple methods of incorporation that significantly improve the production of engineered biochar as an adsorbent for a broad range of trace metals 83 metalloids 210 dyes 88 and nutrients such as phosphate and nitrate 211 in the study by wang et al it is reported that in all the applications evaluated engineered biochar with immobilized nanoparticles gave better results than raw biochar 212 ball milled engineered biochar vermiculite nanocomposite showed a high adsorption capacity for as v from the solution than the pristine biochar 209 the characterization of these adsorbents revealed that a greater surface area pore volume and significant improvements in crystallinity cation activation and improved functional groups in the nanocomposite enhanced as v adsorption in another research the matrix of iron sulfide and biochar was used to successfully synthesize magnetic biochar nanocomposite fes bc by mechanical ball milling the resultant nanocomposite was used in the presence of persulfate for the oxidative degradation of tetracycline tc 213 the characterization results indicated that it is possible to synthesize fes bc which has small particle size the ball milled fes bc also demonstrated adequate ferromagnetism the maximum percentage removal recorded was 87 4 at optimum conditions li et al reported the synthesis of magnetic nano biochar from wheat straw and fecl2 fecl3 using impregnation pyrolysis integrated procedure 214 the synthesised pristine magnetic biochar pmbc at different temperature was then ball milled to enhance the surface characteristics of the nano biochar the ball milled magnetic biochar bmbc showed high oxygen content on the surface of the nano biochar treated at different temperature than the corresponding pmbc moreover ball milling effectively increased the surface area of the magnetic nano biochar which resulted in effective removal 99 of tetracycline tc and hg ii in another study ball milling was used to prepare two ultrafine magnetic biochar fe3o4 and activated carbon ac fe3o4 hybrid materials targeted for removal by adsorption and mechanochemical degradation of pharmaceutical compounds 215 both hybrid adsorbents prepared after 2 h of ball milling exhibited high removal efficiency of 62 7 mg g for cbz and 94 2 mg g for tc carbonaceous magnetic adsorbents were synthesised by ball milling biochar bc and activated carbon ac with fe3o4 nanoparticles for the removal of methylene blue from water 216 from the results it is observed that ball milling with magnetite not only improved the surface properties of the carbonaceous adsorbents especially bc but also introduced magnetic properties through mechanical extrusion furthermore ball mill extrusion increased the methylene blue adsorption capacity of bc by 14 fold magnetic ball milled bc had even greater methylene blue adsorption capacity which was 27 fold greater than non ball milled bc the maximum removal capacity of the magnetic ball milled bc mbm bc was 500 5 mg g which is impressive removal efficiency as compared to ball milled biochar adsorbent 218 mg g the high removal efficiency of mbm bc was attributed to its increased surface area opened pore structure functional groups and aromatic cc bonds which promoted π π and electrostatic interactions 216 xiao et al reported the successful synthesis of ball milled graphitic carbon nitride g c 3 n 4 biochar for simultaneous adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of enrofloxacine efa and total organic carbon toc 217 in their study g c 3 n 4 was obtained by a thermal poly condensation reaction of melamine at 550 c the g c 3 n 4 biochar composites were synthesised by ball milling biochar and g c 3 n 4 together the adsorption and photocatalytic degradation of efa and toc showed that all the g c 3 n 4 biochar composites displayed higher adsorption and photocatalytic degradation to efa than that of pure g c 3 n 4 the 50 g c 3 n 4 biochar showed best removal efficiency of 45 2 and 81 1 of efa 10 mg l under darkness and light conditions with a dosage of 1 mg ml while g c 3 n 4 alone were 19 0 and 27 3 respectively moreover the highest total organic carbon toc removal efficiency 65 9 was observed using the ball milled 50 g c 3 n 4 biochar nanocomposite in the study reported by zheng et al it is confirmed that ball milling is a promising method of synthesising usable biochar nanocomposite where the method of ball milling was used in the fabrication of dual functional mgo biochar nanocomposite 218 the characterization of the biochar nanocomposite obtained shows reduced size nanoscale and mesoporous structure with mgo nanoparticles evenly distributed on the surface of the biochar at low adsorbent dosages of 1 0 g l and 0 2 g l respectively adsorption experiment resulted in 62 9 percent removal of phosphate and 87 5 percent removal of methylene blue 218 6 conclusions this review focused on the main methods of pyrolysis andmodificationof biochar for its application as an adsorbent for water treatment overall ball milled biochars and biochar nanocomposites have been demonstrated as promising materials for environmental remediation however based on the information gap identified such as the application of physical synthesis method ball milling and the merits of combining biochar with different nanomaterials some recommendations are given herewith future research studies should consider the ball milling of biochar 1 the improved properties of these ball milled biochars were investigated and reported to have improved sorption capacities of various biochars particularly pristine biochar that suffers from low aromaticity 2 green synthesis of nanoparticles should be exploredin future research forthe formation of biochar based nanocomposites to reduce the risk of cross contamination due to the chemicals being used in the preparation of the nanoparticles for drinking and wastewater treatment 3 most of the modifications and applications of biochar have been done at laboratory scale therefore future applications should be extended to the industrial scale 4 the use of ball milled biochar for the removal of both inorganic and organic contaminants is still in the early stages of development and further research is required for abroad understanding of the concept behind the ball milling of biochar 5 agglomeration potential of ball milled biochar is still being debated because biochars are mostly obtained from agricultural waste woods that contain plentiful lignocellulose the lignin does act as a binder during the ball milling process therefore it could increase the agglomeration potential which is one of the major problems of materials in nano scales further research needs to be done on the potential agglomeration of ball milled biochar especially biochar from other feedstock sources from plant wastes declaration of
