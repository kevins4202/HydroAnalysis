3905,the formation of goaf in coal mines changes the original hydrological processes this study investigated the influence mechanism of goaf on surface runoff and constructed a model for predicting hydrological processes in mining areas with goaf for this purpose the control basin of jingle hydrology station in shanxi province which has experienced severe coal mining damage was taken as the research area first based on field investigation indoor simulation experiments of runoff generation and confluence mechanism in goaf were designed then according to the experimental results the runoff mechanism and water balance change in goaf were analyzed runoff generation and confluence mechanism in goaf were parameterized and introduced into a hydrological model to simulate floods and the water balance equation of goaf was introduced into the two parameter monthly water balance model mwbm to simulate annual runoff finally with 1951 2017 as the study period 1990 was taken as the reference time for the appearance of goaf by introducing generalized parameters to recalculate 12 flood processes after 1990 the qualification rate of the simulation results increased from 0 to 66 67 by introducing the goaf water balance equation into mwbm to simulate the runoff process after 1990 the qualification rate of the simulation results of runoff and runoff peak flow increased from 22 22 to 55 56 the introduction of parameters and water balance equation effectively improved the simulation accuracy of the model for predicting floods and annual runoff after large scale coal mining keywords

production safety arenas lago et al 2013 arenas lago et al 2014 cerqueira et al 2011 cerqueira et al 2012 catchment runoff is an important form of natural water and an important component of hydrological processes however under the influence of climate change and human activities the amount of runoff has significantly declined in many river basins destouni et al 2013 ning et al 2016 which has significantly affected the water cycle ecosystems regional economies and so on in particular runoff in areas with coal deposits faces additional risks from coal mining during which cracks may develop in the roof of the mines the development of water conducting fracture zones in coal mining areas changes the hydrogeological conditions around the mines in many areas the formation of surface water is closely related to the hydraulic connection between surface water and ground water in goaf fig 1 duarte et al 2019 xu et al 2020 therefore a deep understanding of the goaf runoff mechanism is necessary to accurately predict hydrological processes in coal mining areas gredilla et al 2017 gredilla et al 2019 gasparotto et al 2018 at present some studies have investigated the impact of coal mining on runoff processes table 1 summarizes existing studies on the impact of coal mining on runoff liang et al 2013 li et al 2016 guo et al 2016 ping et al 2017 wu and dong 2018 guo et al 2019 luan et al 2020 relevant studies have shown that coal mining significantly affects river runoff resulting in the reduction of river runoff and research methods regarding river runoff influenced by coal mining are mainly based on the following approach first rainfall runoff is divided into two or more periods using a hydrological model with different main factors affecting runoff in each period then the main period of coal mining influencing runoff is determined finally by comparing changes in runoff before and after large scale coal mining the influence of coal mining on runoff is quantitatively analyzed most studies considered a time scale of months or years rarely considering the impact of coal mining on short duration flood processes moreover research on the influence mechanism of coal mining damage on surface runoff processes are lacking and a suitable hydrological model of the special underlying surface of goaf needs to be further developed shanxi province of china is endowed with unique coal resources with a coal bearing area of 6 2 104 km2 accounting for 39 5 of the land area of the province liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b in particular the control basin of jingle hydrology station in shanxi province has experienced serious deterioration due to coal mining for accurate prediction of hydrological processes in shanxi province under the condition of coal mining a deep understanding of the runoff mechanism in mined out areas is very necessary considering the abovementioned issues this study investigated the influence mechanism of goaf on surface runoff and predicted hydrological processes taking the control basin of jingle hydrology station as the study area the main objectives are as follows 1 based on field investigation data conduct laboratory experiments to analyze the influence mechanism of goaf on surface runoff considering the process of runoff generation and confluence and the change of water balance 2 parameterize runoff generation and confluence mechanism in goaf and construct a hydrological model of goaf for flood forecasting 3 introduced the variation of water balance in goaf into annual runoff simulation and predict annual runoff using a monthly water balance model 2 study area and data jingle hydrology station is located in the upper reaches of the main stream of fenhe river which is the second largest tributary of the yellow river and the largest river in shanxi province zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b the basin area under control is 2799 km2 and 18 coal mines with mining rights are distributed in the study area fig 2 the coal seam is distributed along the east and west sides of fenhe river fig 2 shows the geographical location and distribution of coal mines in the study area in this study rainfall and runoff processes in the control basin from 1951 to 2017 were taken as the basic data fig 3 3 experimental study on the runoff mechanism 3 1 field investigation the soil texture and damage degree of goaf in the control basin were investigated to obtain reference for experimental design three representative coal mines from upstream to downstream were selected as the field investigation objects and statistics of the trend extension length average width average depth and area of damaged land in each mining area were prepared taking one of the coal mines as an example the development of fractures is shown in fig 4 and table 2 the comprehensive research results showed that the fracture ratio of goaf in the control basin usually ranges between 0 and 2 in practice the depth of facture development widely varies and can can be generally divided into two categories one type is developed on the surface without a conducting water barrier while the other type is connected directly to goaf by a conducting water barrier 3 2 laboratory simulation experiment according to the investigation results of soil texture types and fissure development in the basin the soil texture type designed in this experiment is malan loess and two groups of experimental schemes were designed for the ground surface fissure rate 0 i e no fissure control group and 1 with corresponding fissure areas of 0 m2 and 0 02 m2 respectively four rectangular planks were designed to be embedded into the soil to simulate surface fissures under both conditions two planks were 30 cm high and two were 50 cm all with a width of 2 5 cm and a length of 40 cm the two 30 cm high planks simulated shallow fissures not leading to the goaf whereas the two 50 cm high planks simulated deep fissures leading to the goaf according to the characteristics of rainstorm intensity within the control basin of jingle hydrology station the rainfall intensity of the runoff experiment was designed to be 30 mm h and the upstream discharge of the river confluence experiment was designed to be 120 l h overall six groups of experiments were designed for runoff generation and confluence as shown in table3 the experimental system is shown in fig 5 presenting four parts 3 3 experimental results and analysis 3 3 1 soil moisture content for experimental groups s 0 s t 1 and s n 1 changes in the volumetric water content vwc of soil are shown figs 6 8 the figures show that the changes in vwc and the advancement of the wetting front in the first second and third layers of s t 1 and s n 1 are consistent when the wetting front around the fracture was pushed to the fourth layer of soil the advancement of the wetting front around the fracture in s n 1 and s 0 was consistent but the wetting front around the fracture in s t 1 advanced faster this suggests that the deeper the fracture the greater the depth of influence on the process of soil water infiltration to further compare the variation law of vwc before and after fracture generation the soil vwc in different groups of experiments at the same time was compared as shown in fig 9 at 60 min the soil in the first layer did not reach the field water capacity but the soil around the fissure in the second layer was supplied with water at 90 min and 120 min the soil around the fissure in the second layer did not reach the field water capacity but the soil around the fissure in the third layer received water supply this indicates that fissure generation accelerates the rate of downward water migration in soil and changes the traditional process of soil water infiltration at 150 min and 180 min the wetting front advanced to the third layer of soil at the location of the fissure when the third layer of soil does not reach the field water capacity in the case that fissure development does not reach the goaf s n 1 the soil in the fourth layer does not receive water supply however when the fissure leads to the goaf s t 1 the fourth layer of soil receives water supply further demonstrating that the deeper the fissure development the deeper the influence on the water infiltration process from the comparison diagram of soil water at 180 min the vwc in the s n 1 and s t 1 groups is significantly higher than that in the s 0 group indicating that the emergence of fissures promoted rainfall recharge of the vadose zone 3 3 2 runoff generation for the experiment of runoff generation with rainfall duration of 3 h changes in surface runoff interflow and subsurface runoff under different fissure development conditions are shown in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 a surface runoff was generated after 1 5 h under different fissure development conditions within 150 min surface runoff declined under both fracture development conditions which had a similar degree of impact on surface runoff the analysis of vwc change suggests that this was because more water was supplied to the deep soil during the rainfall process at 180 min surface runoff under the condition of the s n 1 group reached the same level as that of the s 0 group approximately 8 l 30 min but under the condition of the s t 1 group surface runoff did not increase and stabilized at approximately 2 l 30 min therefore the mechanism of the decrease in surface runoff by fissures leading to the goaf can be ascertained to be different from that of fissures not reaching the goaf as channels of rapid leakage fissures leading to the goaf promote the recharge of underground water by surface runoff during the whole flow generation process regarding interflow fig 10 bc it appeared in the first layer at 90 min in the s n 1 and s 0 groups but it appeared in the first layer at 120 min in the s t 1 group accordingly fissures leading to the goaf can be ascertained to delay the appearance of the interflow in the s n 1 and s 0 groups interflow in the first layer stabilized approximately 1 5 l at 150 min and 180 min respectively in contrast with the fissure reaching the goaf interflow remained steady at approximately 0 3 l 30 min indicating that the change mechanism of the interflow in goaf differs between fissures reaching and not reaching the goaf for fissures not reaching the goaf water supply around the fractures increases but with continuous replenishment exceeding the affected depth the fractures no longer affect the interflow in contrast for fissures reaching the goaf as a channel of rapid leakage the fissure allows free water which should flow laterally under the action of the lateral component of gravity to preferentially supply to the underground water flow reducing the interflow throughout the process as shown in fig 10 d underground runoff was not generated during the 3 h rainfall in the s n 1 and s 0 groups but it was generated at 90 min of rainfall in the s t 1 group and the contribution of rainfall to runoff increased with the passage of time the correlation between the reduction of surface runoff reduction of interflow and underground runoff was analyzed for 120 min of rainfall in the s 0 s n 1 and s t 1 groups the results are shown in the table 4 the sum of surface runoff reduction and interflow reduction in each period was close to the amount of groundwater runoff therefore to the development of fissures reaching the goaf can be ascertained to significantly increase the amount of water replenishing groundwater runoff during rainfall there are two sources of supply 1 during the whole runoff process surface runoff replenishes groundwater runoff 2 free water in the soil is supplied to the groundwater runoff preferentially through the fissure 3 3 3 confluence the measured river flow and groundwater flow in the c 0 c t 1 and c n 1 groups at an upstream inflow of 120 l h at different times are shown in fig 11 the flow rate exhibited significant differences under different experiment conditions in the c n 1 group the flow rate was maintained at approximately 10 l 5 min after a flow rate reduction for 30 min basically consistent with the c 0 group however in the c t 1 group the flow rate was maintained at approximately 5 5 l 5 min after a reduction for 20 min moreover the underground water flow developed and groundwater flow was maintained at approximately 4 2 l 5 min after the river flow stabilized which indicates that the development of the fissure to the underground goaf facilitates rapid seepage of river flow and supplies it to the underground goaf in the whole confluence process of the river thus reducing river flow 3 4 parameterization of experimental results as hydrologic simulation is a sequential process parameters need to be simulated and the parameters should be stable against variations in time considering this requirement surface runoff reduction in surface runoff decrement rate of surface runoff interflow reduction of interflow decrement rate of interflow confluence reduction of confluence and decrement rate of confluence were used as indicators in this study the variability of each indicator with time was indicated with standard deviation sd and the results are shown in table 5 the calculation method of the decrement rate dr is as follows 3 1 dr y y y where y is the index data of no fissure control group y is the index data of fissure control group the calculation method standard deviation sd is as follows 3 2 sd m m n where m is sample value the m is the average value of sample n is the sample size the decrement rate of surface runoff interflow and confluence were the most stable parameters against time therefore when conducting goaf surface runoff simulation the decrement rate of surface runoff interflow and confluence were taken as the parameters for introducing into the model combined with the analysis of the influence of fracture development on runoff components in this study the following parameters were introduced to represent the influence of special underlay in goaf on the runoff process decrement rate of surface runoff before crest value α when cracks do not reach the underground goaf they become water storage gaps and rapid infiltration channels which affect the rainfall runoff production process in the early rainfall period and lead to the reduction of surface runoff when the cracks become saturated with water and the soil at the depth of the cracks are fully replenished the effects disappear α is used to represent the proportion of reduced surface runoff before reaching the crest value reduced rate of surface runoff β cracks reaching the underground mined out area will become channels of rapid infiltration for surface runoff resulting in the reduction of surface runoff β represents the proportion of reduced surface runoff attributable to fissures reaching the goaf to the total surface runoff detention time of interflow γ cracks reaching the underground goaf will prioritize water supply to the deep soil and prolong the outflow time of soil γ represents the delay time of the interflow attributable to fissures reaching the goaf decrement rate of interflow δ cracks reaching the underground goaf will become channels for rapid supply of interflow to groundwater flow resulting in the reduction of interflow δ represents the proportion of reduced interflow attributable to fissures reaching the goaf to the total interflow decrement rate of river flow before crest value ε cracks not reaching the underground goaf become water storage gaps and rapid infiltration channels which lead to the reduction of river flow runoff when the cracks become saturated with water and the soil at the depth of the cracks are fully replenished the effects disappear ε indicates the proportion of reduced river flow at the early stage of the confluence reduced rate of river flow ζ cracks reaching the underground goaf will become rapid infiltration channels for river flow resulting in continuous reduction of river flow ζ represents the reduction effect of fissures reaching the goaf on river flow during the whole course of river confluence according to the experimental results the reference value range of each parameter is given as shown in table 6 3 5 introduced parameters 3 5 1 slope production and confluence parameters 1 surface runoff parameters let the surface runoff δ r 0 function be f δ r 0 r 0 i i 1 2 3 n and f δ r 0 reaches the maximum value when i m that is r 0 m max f δ r 0 the function of surface runoff δ r 0 α obtained by introducing parameter α is 3 3 f δ r 0 α 1 α r 0 i i 1 2 3 m r 0 i i m 1 m 2 n the function of surface runoff δ r 0 β obtained by introducing parameter β is f δ r 0 β 1 β r 0 i i 1 2 3 n 3 4 then the surface runoff δ r 0 α β of goaf with the special underlying surface under the joint action of parameters α and β can be written as 3 5 f δ r 0 α β 1 α 1 β r 0 i i 1 2 3 m 1 β r 0 i i m 1 m 2 n 2 interflow parameters let the function of interflow δ r s be f δ r s r s i i 1 2 3 n then the function of interflow δ r s γ obtained by introducing parameter γ is 3 6 f δ r s γ 0 i 1 2 3 γ r s i γ i γ 1 γ 2 n the function of interflow δ r s δ obtained by introducing parameter δ is 3 7 f δ r s δ 1 δ r s i i 1 2 3 n then the interflow of goaf δ r s γ δ with the special underlying surface under the joint action of parameters γ and δ can be written as 3 8 f δ r s γ δ 0 i 1 2 3 γ 1 δ r s i γ i γ 1 γ 2 n 3 5 2 river confluence parameters let the river flow δ q function be f δ q q i i 1 2 3 n and f δ q reaches the maximum value when i m that is q m max f δ q the function of surface runoff δ q ε obtained by introducing parameter ε is 3 9 f δ q ε 1 ε q i i 1 2 3 m q i i m 1 m 2 n the function of river flow δ q ζ obtained by introducing parameter ζ is 3 10 f δ q ζ 1 ζ q i i 1 2 3 n then the river flow f δ q ε ζ of goaf with the special underlying surface under the joint action of parameters ε and ζ can be written as 3 11 f δ q ε ζ 1 ε 1 ζ q i i 1 2 3 m 1 ζ q i i m 1 m 2 n 3 6 change in water balance the calculation of rainfall runoff in a watershed is a water balance problem if a basin is considered as a system rainfall is the input to the system whereas evapotranspiration and export flow are its outputs the water balance equation is as follows 3 12 p s r e where s is water storage for the watershed p is rainfall r is runoff and e is evaporation analyzing the experimental data the water balance equation under experimental conditions was constructed under the experimental conditions as the rainfall duration is short evaporation can be considered to be 0 the results are shown in table 7 in the s 0 and s n 1 experimental groups the water quantity appears to be basically balanced with a small difference between the input and output water in the basin between 0 001 m3 and 0 001 m3 accounting for only 0 4 of the input rainfall for experimental groups s 0 and s n 1 the water volume can be considered to be balanced however for the s t 1 experimental group the difference between the input and output water in the basin became larger after 90 min of rainfall reaching 0 01 which accounts for 31 67 of the input rainfall therefore the water quantity is unbalanced in the s t 1 experimental group the groundwater flow in goaf was considered as the output of the system and the water balance was re calculated table 8 considering goaf groundwater as the output of the system the difference between the input and output water in the basin became narrow after 90 min of rainfall reaching only 0 01 which accounts for 3 of the input rainfall therefore the water is balanced according to the experimental results when calculating the water balance in goaf it is necessary to consider goaf groundwater as the output of the system and reconstruct the water balance equation 3 13 p s r e g where g is goaf groundwater from the results of the analysis of the runoff mechanism of goaf goaf groundwater originated from surface runoff and interflow through crack leakage from underground mined out areas for flood processes the decrement rate of surface runoff changes over time in the most stable and the annual runoff process is the superposition of the floods therefore for annual runoff simulation a certain reduction ratio can be considered to obtain the goaf underground flow 3 14 g 1 x r where x is the reduction coefficient representing the proportion of the water leakage to the goaf in the surface runoff it is dimensionless and its value ranges between 0 and 1 4 runoff simulation 4 1 division of coal mining influence period in the control basin of jingle hydrology station coal mining is one of the significant human activities since 1990 the number of coal mines has increased gradually and coal production has been booming accordingly based on daily rainfall and runoff data covering 1959 2017 statistical analysis of the correlation coefficient of rainfall and runoff was performed and the research period was divided into 1959 1990 and 1991 2017 considering the outbreak of large scale coal mining fig 13 the correlation coefficient of rainfall and runoff in the control basin decreased by 0 0052 annually from 1951 to 2017 by 0 0002 annually from 1951 to 1990 and by 0 0082 annually from 1991 to 2017 after the large scale coal mining in 1990 the correlation of rainfall and runoff in the control basin decreased significantly therefore the year 1990 can be used to demarcate the impact period of coal mining 4 2 accuracy evaluation index of simulation results in this study the flood simulation results were evaluated using the peak discharge error δ q runoff depth δ p difference in the appearance of peak flood δ h and correlation coefficient dc as evaluation indicators taking 20 of the measured peak discharge as the permissible error eq of flood peak forecast 20 of the measured runoff depth was set as the allowable runoff depth forecast error ep if the ep value was greater than 20 mm it was set at 20 mm and if the value was less than 3 mm it was set at 3 mm taking 3 h as the permissible error of peak time δt the permissible absolute value of dc was set at less than 0 5 the runoff simulation results were evaluated using the runoff volume error δ r runoff peak flow error δ r m and dc as evaluation indicators taking 20 of the measured runoff volume as the permissible error er of runoff forecast 20 of the measured runoff peak flow was set as the allowable error er m and the permissible absolute value of dc was set at less than 0 5 the specific calculation formula is as follows δ q q s q 0 e q q 0 20 where q s represents simulated flow m3 s q

province was used for establishing the two scheme hydrological model ren et al 2018 the two schemes are shown in fig 12 firstly a hydrological simulation was carried out without considering goaf scheme 1 then the runoff process was simulated considering goaf scheme 2 finally the rationality of the model was evaluated 4 3 2 comparison of model simulation results for model validation 25 extreme flood events in the control basin from 1950 to 2017 were selected firstly scheme 1 was adopted to conduct hydrological simulation of the 25 flood processes and the simulation results were evaluated for accuracy table 9 for 13 floods before 1990 the results show that the qualification rate of simulated floods is 76 92 the qualification rate of simulated flood peak flow is 92 31 the qualification rate of simulated peak show time is 100 the qualification rate of simulated runoff depth is 100 and simulations of 11 floods exhibited dc values reaching 0 5 the results of the simulation of 12 floods after 1990 were poor and could not meet the requirements of the specifications of water situation prediction considering the influence of the special undersurface in goaf on the confluence process scheme 2 was applied and generalized parameters were introduced to recalculate flood processes after 1990 and the results are shown in table 10 and fig 14 after introducing goaf parameters the qualification rate of the simulation results of the 12 floods increased from 0 to 66 67 the qualification rate of simulated flood peak flow increased from 0 to 75 00 the qualification rate of simulated peak appearance time increased from 50 00 to 91 67 and the number of floods with a dc value of 0 5 increased from 0 to 9 the introduction of goaf parameters after large scale coal mining after 1990 effectively improved the flood simulation accuracy 4 4 annual runoff simulation 4 4 1 establishment of runoff simulation model the wanjiazhai yellow river diversion project is located at the source of fenhe river in the control basin of jingle hydrology station after 2008 it began large scale diversion of water table 11 as a result runoff in jingle hydrology station increased significantly after 2008 and the distribution of annual discharge became unclear therefore in this study the period from 1991 to 2008 was selected as the research period after coal mining the two parameter monthly water balance model mwbm was used for runoff simulation in goaf xiong and guo 1999 firstly runoff simulation without considering goaf was carried out then the goaf water balance equation and parameter x were introduced into mwbm to simulate the runoff process after the appearance of goaf finally the results were analyzed 4 4 2 comparison of model simulation results for the 40 years between 1951 and 1990 the simulation results of runoff obtained using mwbm are shown in table 12 the qualification rates of simulated runoff volume and runoff peak flow were all 65 and the dc values of 34 runoff processes reached 0 5 for the 18 years between 1991 and 2008 the simulation results of runoff obtained using mwbm are shown in table 13 the qualification rates of simulated runoff volume and runoff peak flow were all 22 22 and 15 runoff processes exhibited dc values reaching 0 5 overall the runoff simulation results were poor considering the influence of the special undersurface in goaf on the confluence process the goaf water balance equation and parameter x were introduced into mwbm to simulate the runoff process after 1990 the most accurate simulation results were obtained with an x value of 0 2 as shown in table 14 and fig 15 the qualification rates of the simulation results of runoff and runoff peak flow increased from 22 22 to 55 56 and the number of flood processes with a dc value of 0 5 was 15 the introduction of goaf parameters after large scale coal mining after 1990 effectively improved the runoff simulation accuracy 5 conclusions and suggestion during coal mining the upper strata may move fissures may develop and new underground water storage space goaf may appear changing the original hydrological processes through field investigation combined with laboratory experiment and hydrological simulation the following important conclusions were obtained in this study 1 for surface runoff when surface fissures are shallow the fissures mainly affect the early stage of surface runoff in the goaf and reduce surface runoff when deeper fissures develop and reach the goaf the fissures reduce surface runoff throughout the process for interflow fissures reaching the goaf will prolong the outflow of interflow and reduce the interflow throughout the process for underground runoff fissures reaching the goaf significantly increase the amount of water replenishing groundwater runoff 2 by introducing generalized model parameters to the hydrological model of the special underlying surface of goaf the simulation accuracy of the hydrological model could be effectively improved taking the control basin of the jingle hydrology station as an example for 12 flood processes after the appearance of goaf by introducing the generalized model parameters into the hydrological model 9 of the 12 floods were found to be qualified and the accuracy was thus significantly improved 3 the appearance of goaf changed the original water balance process and the underground water flow needs to be considered as the output of the system by introducing the goaf water balance equation and parameter x into mwbm to simulate the runoff process after 1990 the qualification rate of the simulation results of runoff and runoff peak flow was increased from 22 22 to 55 56 significantly improving the accuracy nevertheless due to the limited time and experimental conditions this study has some limitations that need to be addressed further 1 the experimental device designed in this study is an indoor physical model large differences exist between the actual loading and actual conditions combining the results of this study the next step could be to carry out field test in order to compare and analyze the actual runoff generation and confluence processes 2 based on the results of this study in future research dynamic model parameter calibration can be carried out by combining ground observation and satellite remote sensing observation data and fully taking into account the influence of vegetation coverage and other factors funding this research was funded by fund projects national natural science foundation of

3905,the formation of goaf in coal mines changes the original hydrological processes this study investigated the influence mechanism of goaf on surface runoff and constructed a model for predicting hydrological processes in mining areas with goaf for this purpose the control basin of jingle hydrology station in shanxi province which has experienced severe coal mining damage was taken as the research area first based on field investigation indoor simulation experiments of runoff generation and confluence mechanism in goaf were designed then according to the experimental results the runoff mechanism and water balance change in goaf were analyzed runoff generation and confluence mechanism in goaf were parameterized and introduced into a hydrological model to simulate floods and the water balance equation of goaf was introduced into the two parameter monthly water balance model mwbm to simulate annual runoff finally with 1951 2017 as the study period 1990 was taken as the reference time for the appearance of goaf by introducing generalized parameters to recalculate 12 flood processes after 1990 the qualification rate of the simulation results increased from 0 to 66 67 by introducing the goaf water balance equation into mwbm to simulate the runoff process after 1990 the qualification rate of the simulation results of runoff and runoff peak flow increased from 22 22 to 55 56 the introduction of parameters and water balance equation effectively improved the simulation accuracy of the model for predicting floods and annual runoff after large scale coal mining keywords

production safety arenas lago et al 2013 arenas lago et al 2014 cerqueira et al 2011 cerqueira et al 2012 catchment runoff is an important form of natural water and an important component of hydrological processes however under the influence of climate change and human activities the amount of runoff has significantly declined in many river basins destouni et al 2013 ning et al 2016 which has significantly affected the water cycle ecosystems regional economies and so on in particular runoff in areas with coal deposits faces additional risks from coal mining during which cracks may develop in the roof of the mines the development of water conducting fracture zones in coal mining areas changes the hydrogeological conditions around the mines in many areas the formation of surface water is closely related to the hydraulic connection between surface water and ground water in goaf fig 1 duarte et al 2019 xu et al 2020 therefore a deep understanding of the goaf runoff mechanism is necessary to accurately predict hydrological processes in coal mining areas gredilla et al 2017 gredilla et al 2019 gasparotto et al 2018 at present some studies have investigated the impact of coal mining on runoff processes table 1 summarizes existing studies on the impact of coal mining on runoff liang et al 2013 li et al 2016 guo et al 2016 ping et al 2017 wu and dong 2018 guo et al 2019 luan et al 2020 relevant studies have shown that coal mining significantly affects river runoff resulting in the reduction of river runoff and research methods regarding river runoff influenced by coal mining are mainly based on the following approach first rainfall runoff is divided into two or more periods using a hydrological model with different main factors affecting runoff in each period then the main period of coal mining influencing runoff is determined finally by comparing changes in runoff before and after large scale coal mining the influence of coal mining on runoff is quantitatively analyzed most studies considered a time scale of months or years rarely considering the impact of coal mining on short duration flood processes moreover research on the influence mechanism of coal mining damage on surface runoff processes are lacking and a suitable hydrological model of the special underlying surface of goaf needs to be further developed shanxi province of china is endowed with unique coal resources with a coal bearing area of 6 2 104 km2 accounting for 39 5 of the land area of the province liu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b in particular the control basin of jingle hydrology station in shanxi province has experienced serious deterioration due to coal mining for accurate prediction of hydrological processes in shanxi province under the condition of coal mining a deep understanding of the runoff mechanism in mined out areas is very necessary considering the abovementioned issues this study investigated the influence mechanism of goaf on surface runoff and predicted hydrological processes taking the control basin of jingle hydrology station as the study area the main objectives are as follows 1 based on field investigation data conduct laboratory experiments to analyze the influence mechanism of goaf on surface runoff considering the process of runoff generation and confluence and the change of water balance 2 parameterize runoff generation and confluence mechanism in goaf and construct a hydrological model of goaf for flood forecasting 3 introduced the variation of water balance in goaf into annual runoff simulation and predict annual runoff using a monthly water balance model 2 study area and data jingle hydrology station is located in the upper reaches of the main stream of fenhe river which is the second largest tributary of the yellow river and the largest river in shanxi province zhang et al 2020a zhang et al 2020b the basin area under control is 2799 km2 and 18 coal mines with mining rights are distributed in the study area fig 2 the coal seam is distributed along the east and west sides of fenhe river fig 2 shows the geographical location and distribution of coal mines in the study area in this study rainfall and runoff processes in the control basin from 1951 to 2017 were taken as the basic data fig 3 3 experimental study on the runoff mechanism 3 1 field investigation the soil texture and damage degree of goaf in the control basin were investigated to obtain reference for experimental design three representative coal mines from upstream to downstream were selected as the field investigation objects and statistics of the trend extension length average width average depth and area of damaged land in each mining area were prepared taking one of the coal mines as an example the development of fractures is shown in fig 4 and table 2 the comprehensive research results showed that the fracture ratio of goaf in the control basin usually ranges between 0 and 2 in practice the depth of facture development widely varies and can can be generally divided into two categories one type is developed on the surface without a conducting water barrier while the other type is connected directly to goaf by a conducting water barrier 3 2 laboratory simulation experiment according to the investigation results of soil texture types and fissure development in the basin the soil texture type designed in this experiment is malan loess and two groups of experimental schemes were designed for the ground surface fissure rate 0 i e no fissure control group and 1 with corresponding fissure areas of 0 m2 and 0 02 m2 respectively four rectangular planks were designed to be embedded into the soil to simulate surface fissures under both conditions two planks were 30 cm high and two were 50 cm all with a width of 2 5 cm and a length of 40 cm the two 30 cm high planks simulated shallow fissures not leading to the goaf whereas the two 50 cm high planks simulated deep fissures leading to the goaf according to the characteristics of rainstorm intensity within the control basin of jingle hydrology station the rainfall intensity of the runoff experiment was designed to be 30 mm h and the upstream discharge of the river confluence experiment was designed to be 120 l h overall six groups of experiments were designed for runoff generation and confluence as shown in table3 the experimental system is shown in fig 5 presenting four parts 3 3 experimental results and analysis 3 3 1 soil moisture content for experimental groups s 0 s t 1 and s n 1 changes in the volumetric water content vwc of soil are shown figs 6 8 the figures show that the changes in vwc and the advancement of the wetting front in the first second and third layers of s t 1 and s n 1 are consistent when the wetting front around the fracture was pushed to the fourth layer of soil the advancement of the wetting front around the fracture in s n 1 and s 0 was consistent but the wetting front around the fracture in s t 1 advanced faster this suggests that the deeper the fracture the greater the depth of influence on the process of soil water infiltration to further compare the variation law of vwc before and after fracture generation the soil vwc in different groups of experiments at the same time was compared as shown in fig 9 at 60 min the soil in the first layer did not reach the field water capacity but the soil around the fissure in the second layer was supplied with water at 90 min and 120 min the soil around the fissure in the second layer did not reach the field water capacity but the soil around the fissure in the third layer received water supply this indicates that fissure generation accelerates the rate of downward water migration in soil and changes the traditional process of soil water infiltration at 150 min and 180 min the wetting front advanced to the third layer of soil at the location of the fissure when the third layer of soil does not reach the field water capacity in the case that fissure development does not reach the goaf s n 1 the soil in the fourth layer does not receive water supply however when the fissure leads to the goaf s t 1 the fourth layer of soil receives water supply further demonstrating that the deeper the fissure development the deeper the influence on the water infiltration process from the comparison diagram of soil water at 180 min the vwc in the s n 1 and s t 1 groups is significantly higher than that in the s 0 group indicating that the emergence of fissures promoted rainfall recharge of the vadose zone 3 3 2 runoff generation for the experiment of runoff generation with rainfall duration of 3 h changes in surface runoff interflow and subsurface runoff under different fissure development conditions are shown in fig 10 as shown in fig 10 a surface runoff was generated after 1 5 h under different fissure development conditions within 150 min surface runoff declined under both fracture development conditions which had a similar degree of impact on surface runoff the analysis of vwc change suggests that this was because more water was supplied to the deep soil during the rainfall process at 180 min surface runoff under the condition of the s n 1 group reached the same level as that of the s 0 group approximately 8 l 30 min but under the condition of the s t 1 group surface runoff did not increase and stabilized at approximately 2 l 30 min therefore the mechanism of the decrease in surface runoff by fissures leading to the goaf can be ascertained to be different from that of fissures not reaching the goaf as channels of rapid leakage fissures leading to the goaf promote the recharge of underground water by surface runoff during the whole flow generation process regarding interflow fig 10 bc it appeared in the first layer at 90 min in the s n 1 and s 0 groups but it appeared in the first layer at 120 min in the s t 1 group accordingly fissures leading to the goaf can be ascertained to delay the appearance of the interflow in the s n 1 and s 0 groups interflow in the first layer stabilized approximately 1 5 l at 150 min and 180 min respectively in contrast with the fissure reaching the goaf interflow remained steady at approximately 0 3 l 30 min indicating that the change mechanism of the interflow in goaf differs between fissures reaching and not reaching the goaf for fissures not reaching the goaf water supply around the fractures increases but with continuous replenishment exceeding the affected depth the fractures no longer affect the interflow in contrast for fissures reaching the goaf as a channel of rapid leakage the fissure allows free water which should flow laterally under the action of the lateral component of gravity to preferentially supply to the underground water flow reducing the interflow throughout the process as shown in fig 10 d underground runoff was not generated during the 3 h rainfall in the s n 1 and s 0 groups but it was generated at 90 min of rainfall in the s t 1 group and the contribution of rainfall to runoff increased with the passage of time the correlation between the reduction of surface runoff reduction of interflow and underground runoff was analyzed for 120 min of rainfall in the s 0 s n 1 and s t 1 groups the results are shown in the table 4 the sum of surface runoff reduction and interflow reduction in each period was close to the amount of groundwater runoff therefore to the development of fissures reaching the goaf can be ascertained to significantly increase the amount of water replenishing groundwater runoff during rainfall there are two sources of supply 1 during the whole runoff process surface runoff replenishes groundwater runoff 2 free water in the soil is supplied to the groundwater runoff preferentially through the fissure 3 3 3 confluence the measured river flow and groundwater flow in the c 0 c t 1 and c n 1 groups at an upstream inflow of 120 l h at different times are shown in fig 11 the flow rate exhibited significant differences under different experiment conditions in the c n 1 group the flow rate was maintained at approximately 10 l 5 min after a flow rate reduction for 30 min basically consistent with the c 0 group however in the c t 1 group the flow rate was maintained at approximately 5 5 l 5 min after a reduction for 20 min moreover the underground water flow developed and groundwater flow was maintained at approximately 4 2 l 5 min after the river flow stabilized which indicates that the development of the fissure to the underground goaf facilitates rapid seepage of river flow and supplies it to the underground goaf in the whole confluence process of the river thus reducing river flow 3 4 parameterization of experimental results as hydrologic simulation is a sequential process parameters need to be simulated and the parameters should be stable against variations in time considering this requirement surface runoff reduction in surface runoff decrement rate of surface runoff interflow reduction of interflow decrement rate of interflow confluence reduction of confluence and decrement rate of confluence were used as indicators in this study the variability of each indicator with time was indicated with standard deviation sd and the results are shown in table 5 the calculation method of the decrement rate dr is as follows 3 1 dr y y y where y is the index data of no fissure control group y is the index data of fissure control group the calculation method standard deviation sd is as follows 3 2 sd m m n where m is sample value the m is the average value of sample n is the sample size the decrement rate of surface runoff interflow and confluence were the most stable parameters against time therefore when conducting goaf surface runoff simulation the decrement rate of surface runoff interflow and confluence were taken as the parameters for introducing into the model combined with the analysis of the influence of fracture development on runoff components in this study the following parameters were introduced to represent the influence of special underlay in goaf on the runoff process decrement rate of surface runoff before crest value α when cracks do not reach the underground goaf they become water storage gaps and rapid infiltration channels which affect the rainfall runoff production process in the early rainfall period and lead to the reduction of surface runoff when the cracks become saturated with water and the soil at the depth of the cracks are fully replenished the effects disappear α is used to represent the proportion of reduced surface runoff before reaching the crest value reduced rate of surface runoff β cracks reaching the underground mined out area will become channels of rapid infiltration for surface runoff resulting in the reduction of surface runoff β represents the proportion of reduced surface runoff attributable to fissures reaching the goaf to the total surface runoff detention time of interflow γ cracks reaching the underground goaf will prioritize water supply to the deep soil and prolong the outflow time of soil γ represents the delay time of the interflow attributable to fissures reaching the goaf decrement rate of interflow δ cracks reaching the underground goaf will become channels for rapid supply of interflow to groundwater flow resulting in the reduction of interflow δ represents the proportion of reduced interflow attributable to fissures reaching the goaf to the total interflow decrement rate of river flow before crest value ε cracks not reaching the underground goaf become water storage gaps and rapid infiltration channels which lead to the reduction of river flow runoff when the cracks become saturated with water and the soil at the depth of the cracks are fully replenished the effects disappear ε indicates the proportion of reduced river flow at the early stage of the confluence reduced rate of river flow ζ cracks reaching the underground goaf will become rapid infiltration channels for river flow resulting in continuous reduction of river flow ζ represents the reduction effect of fissures reaching the goaf on river flow during the whole course of river confluence according to the experimental results the reference value range of each parameter is given as shown in table 6 3 5 introduced parameters 3 5 1 slope production and confluence parameters 1 surface runoff parameters let the surface runoff δ r 0 function be f δ r 0 r 0 i i 1 2 3 n and f δ r 0 reaches the maximum value when i m that is r 0 m max f δ r 0 the function of surface runoff δ r 0 α obtained by introducing parameter α is 3 3 f δ r 0 α 1 α r 0 i i 1 2 3 m r 0 i i m 1 m 2 n the function of surface runoff δ r 0 β obtained by introducing parameter β is f δ r 0 β 1 β r 0 i i 1 2 3 n 3 4 then the surface runoff δ r 0 α β of goaf with the special underlying surface under the joint action of parameters α and β can be written as 3 5 f δ r 0 α β 1 α 1 β r 0 i i 1 2 3 m 1 β r 0 i i m 1 m 2 n 2 interflow parameters let the function of interflow δ r s be f δ r s r s i i 1 2 3 n then the function of interflow δ r s γ obtained by introducing parameter γ is 3 6 f δ r s γ 0 i 1 2 3 γ r s i γ i γ 1 γ 2 n the function of interflow δ r s δ obtained by introducing parameter δ is 3 7 f δ r s δ 1 δ r s i i 1 2 3 n then the interflow of goaf δ r s γ δ with the special underlying surface under the joint action of parameters γ and δ can be written as 3 8 f δ r s γ δ 0 i 1 2 3 γ 1 δ r s i γ i γ 1 γ 2 n 3 5 2 river confluence parameters let the river flow δ q function be f δ q q i i 1 2 3 n and f δ q reaches the maximum value when i m that is q m max f δ q the function of surface runoff δ q ε obtained by introducing parameter ε is 3 9 f δ q

underlying surface under the joint action of parameters ε and ζ can be written as 3 11 f δ q ε ζ 1 ε 1 ζ q i i 1 2 3 m 1 ζ q i i m 1 m 2 n 3 6 change in water balance the calculation of rainfall runoff in a watershed is a water balance problem if a basin is considered as a system rainfall is the input to the system whereas evapotranspiration and export flow are its outputs the water balance equation is as follows 3 12 p s r e where s is water storage for the watershed p is rainfall r is runoff and e is evaporation analyzing the experimental data the water balance equation under experimental conditions was constructed under the experimental conditions as the rainfall duration is short evaporation can be considered to be 0 the results are shown in table 7 in the s 0 and s n 1 experimental groups the water quantity appears to be basically balanced with a small difference between the input and output water in the basin between 0 001 m3 and 0 001 m3 accounting for only 0 4 of the input rainfall for experimental groups s 0 and s n 1 the water volume can be considered to be balanced however for the s t 1 experimental group the difference between the input and output water in the basin became larger after 90 min of rainfall reaching 0 01 which accounts for 31 67 of the input rainfall therefore the water quantity is unbalanced in the s t 1 experimental group the groundwater flow in goaf was considered as the output of the system and the water balance was re calculated table 8 considering goaf groundwater as the output of the system the difference between the input and output water in the basin became narrow after 90 min of rainfall reaching only 0 01 which accounts for 3 of the input rainfall therefore the water is balanced according to the experimental results when calculating the water balance in goaf it is necessary to consider goaf groundwater as the output of the system and reconstruct the water balance equation 3 13 p s r e g where g is goaf groundwater from the results of the analysis of the runoff mechanism of goaf goaf groundwater originated from surface runoff and interflow through crack leakage from underground mined out areas for flood processes the decrement rate of surface runoff changes over time in the most stable and the annual runoff process is the superposition of the floods therefore for annual runoff simulation a certain reduction ratio can be considered to obtain the goaf underground flow 3 14 g 1 x r where x is the reduction coefficient representing the proportion of the water leakage to the goaf in the surface runoff it is dimensionless and its value ranges between 0 and 1 4 runoff simulation 4 1 division of coal mining influence period in the control basin of jingle hydrology station coal mining is one of the significant human activities since 1990 the number of coal mines has increased gradually and coal production has been booming accordingly based on daily rainfall and runoff data covering 1959 2017 statistical analysis of the correlation coefficient of rainfall and runoff was performed and the research period was divided into 1959 1990 and 1991 2017 considering the outbreak of large scale coal mining fig 13 the correlation coefficient of rainfall and runoff in the control basin decreased by 0 0052 annually from 1951 to 2017 by 0 0002 annually from 1951 to 1990 and by 0 0082 annually from 1991 to 2017 after the large scale coal mining in 1990 the correlation of rainfall and runoff in the control basin decreased significantly therefore the year 1990 can be used to demarcate the impact period of coal mining 4 2 accuracy evaluation index of simulation results in this study the flood simulation results were evaluated using the peak discharge error δ q runoff depth δ p difference in the appearance of peak flood δ h and correlation coefficient dc as evaluation indicators taking 20 of the measured peak discharge as the permissible error eq of flood peak forecast 20 of the measured runoff depth was set as the allowable runoff depth forecast error ep if the ep value was greater than 20 mm it was set at 20 mm and if the value was less than 3 mm it was set at 3 mm taking 3 h as the permissible error of peak time δt the permissible absolute value of dc was set at less than 0 5 the runoff simulation results were evaluated using the runoff volume error δ r runoff peak flow error δ r m and dc as evaluation indicators taking 20 of the measured runoff volume as the permissible error er of runoff forecast 20 of the measured runoff peak flow was set as the allowable error er m and the permissible absolute value of dc was set at less than 0 5 the specific calculation formula is as follows δ q q s q 0 e q q 0 20 where q s represents simulated flow m3 s q

province was used for establishing the two scheme hydrological model ren et al 2018 the two schemes are shown in fig 12 firstly a hydrological simulation was carried out without considering goaf scheme 1 then the runoff process was simulated considering goaf scheme 2 finally the rationality of the model was evaluated 4 3 2 comparison of model simulation results for model validation 25 extreme flood events in the control basin from 1950 to 2017 were selected firstly scheme 1 was adopted to conduct hydrological simulation of the 25 flood processes and the simulation results were evaluated for accuracy table 9 for 13 floods before 1990 the results show that the qualification rate of simulated floods is 76 92 the qualification rate of simulated flood peak flow is 92 31 the qualification rate of simulated peak show time is 100 the qualification rate of simulated runoff depth is 100 and simulations of 11 floods exhibited dc values reaching 0 5 the results of the simulation of 12 floods after 1990 were poor and could not meet the requirements of the specifications of water situation prediction considering the influence of the special undersurface in goaf on the confluence process scheme 2 was applied and generalized parameters were introduced to recalculate flood processes after 1990 and the results are shown in table 10 and fig 14 after introducing goaf parameters the qualification rate of the simulation results of the 12 floods increased from 0 to 66 67 the qualification rate of simulated flood peak flow increased from 0 to 75 00 the qualification rate of simulated peak appearance time increased from 50 00 to 91 67 and the number of floods with a dc value of 0 5 increased from 0 to 9 the introduction of goaf parameters after large scale coal mining after 1990 effectively improved the flood simulation accuracy 4 4 annual runoff simulation 4 4 1 establishment of runoff simulation model the wanjiazhai yellow river diversion project is located at the source of fenhe river in the control basin of jingle hydrology station after 2008 it began large scale diversion of water table 11 as a result runoff in jingle hydrology station increased significantly after 2008 and the distribution of annual discharge became unclear therefore in this study the period from 1991 to 2008 was selected as the research period after coal mining the two parameter monthly water balance model mwbm was used for runoff simulation in goaf xiong and guo 1999 firstly runoff simulation without considering goaf was carried out then the goaf water balance equation and parameter x were introduced into mwbm to simulate the runoff process after the appearance of goaf finally the results were analyzed 4 4 2 comparison of model simulation results for the 40 years between 1951 and 1990 the simulation results of runoff obtained using mwbm are shown in table 12 the qualification rates of simulated runoff volume and runoff peak flow were all 65 and the dc values of 34 runoff processes reached 0 5 for the 18 years between 1991 and 2008 the simulation results of runoff obtained using mwbm are shown in table 13 the qualification rates of simulated runoff volume and runoff peak flow were all 22 22 and 15 runoff processes exhibited dc values reaching 0 5 overall the runoff simulation results were poor considering the influence of the special undersurface in goaf on the confluence process the goaf water balance equation and parameter x were introduced into mwbm to simulate the runoff process after 1990 the most accurate simulation results were obtained with an x value of 0 2 as shown in table 14 and fig 15 the qualification rates of the simulation results of runoff and runoff peak flow increased from 22 22 to 55 56 and the number of flood processes with a dc value of 0 5 was 15 the introduction of goaf parameters after large scale coal mining after 1990 effectively improved the runoff simulation accuracy 5 conclusions and suggestion during coal mining the upper strata may move fissures may develop and new underground water storage space goaf may appear changing the original hydrological processes through field investigation combined with laboratory experiment and hydrological simulation the following important conclusions were obtained in this study 1 for surface runoff when surface fissures are shallow the fissures mainly affect the early stage of surface runoff in the goaf and reduce surface runoff when deeper fissures develop and reach the goaf the fissures reduce surface runoff throughout the process for interflow fissures reaching the goaf will prolong the outflow of interflow and reduce the interflow throughout the process for underground runoff fissures reaching the goaf significantly increase the amount of water replenishing groundwater runoff 2 by introducing generalized model parameters to the hydrological model of the special underlying surface of goaf the simulation accuracy of the hydrological model could be effectively improved taking the control basin of the jingle hydrology station as an example for 12 flood processes after the appearance of goaf by introducing the generalized model parameters into the hydrological model 9 of the 12 floods were found to be qualified and the accuracy was thus significantly improved 3 the appearance of goaf changed the original water balance process and the underground water flow needs to be considered as the output of the system by introducing the goaf water balance equation and parameter x into mwbm to simulate the runoff process after 1990 the qualification rate of the simulation results of runoff and runoff peak flow was increased from 22 22 to 55 56 significantly improving the accuracy nevertheless due to the limited time and experimental conditions this study has some limitations that need to be addressed further 1 the experimental device designed in this study is an indoor physical model large differences exist between the actual loading and actual conditions combining the results of this study the next step could be to carry out field test in order to compare and analyze the actual runoff generation and confluence processes 2 based on the results of this study in future research dynamic model parameter calibration can be carried out by combining ground observation and satellite remote sensing observation data and fully taking into account the influence of vegetation coverage and other factors funding this research was funded by fund projects national natural science foundation of

3906,accurate prediction of reference crop evapotranspiration et0 is important for regional water resources management and optimal design of agricultural irrigation system in this study three hybrid models pso elm ga elm and abc elm integrating the extreme learning machine model elm with three biological heuristic algorithms i e pso ga and abc were proposed for predicting daily et0 based on daily meteorological data from 2000 to 2019 at twelve representative stations in different climatic zones of china the performances of the three hybrid elm models were further compared with the standalone elm model and three empirical models hargreaves priestley talor and makkink models the results showed that the hybrid elm models r 2 0 973 0 999 all performed better than the standalone elm model r 2 0 955 0 989 in four climatic regions in china the estimation accuracy of the empirical models was relatively lower with r2 of 0 822 0 887 and rmse of 0 381 1 951 mm d the r 2 values of pso elm ga elm and abc elm models were 0 993 0 986 and 0 981 and the rmse values were 0 266 mm d 0 306 mm d and 0 404 mm d respectively indicating that the pso elm model had the best performance when setting tmax tmin and rh as the model inputs the pso elm model presented better performance in the temperate continental zone tcz subtropical monsoon region smz and temperate monsoon zone tmz climate zones with r 2 of 0 892 0866 and 0 870 and rmse of 0 773 mm d 0 597 mm d and 0 832 mm d respectively the pso elm model also performed in the mountain plateau region mpz when only tmax and tmin data were available with r2 of 0 808 and rmse of 0 651 mm d all the three biological heuristic algorithms effectively improved the performance of the elm model particularly the pso elm was recommended as a promising model realizing the high precision estimation of daily et0 with fewer meteorological parameters in different climatic zones of china keywords reference crop evapotranspiration et0 extreme learning machine elm genetic algorithm ga artificial bee colony abc particle swarm optimization algorithm pso hybrid model 1 introduction reference crop evapotranspiration et0 mainly includes soil surface evaporation and vegetation transpiration which is an important index for farmland precision irrigation decision making irrigation system optimization and regional water resources management wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b yan et al 2019 ferreira et al 2019 wu et al 2019a wu et al 2019b accurate estimation of et0 is of great significance for real time accurate irrigation decision making and improvement of irrigation water efficiency model development feng et al 2017a zhang et al 2018 the penman monteith p m model proposed by fao in 1998 considering both thermodynamics and dynamics has been widely used as the standard model for et0 estimation in different regions of the world allen et al 1998 however the calculation of the p m model needs diverse meteorological parameters such as maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity and net radiation fan et al 2016 which greatly limits its global application feng et al 2017b the et0 models are roughly divided into four categories aerodynamic based models albrecht brockamp wenner harbeck etc temperature based models baier robertson hamon romanenko and hargreaves etc radiation based models priestley taylor markkink and jensen haise etc and hybrid models penman monteith wright jensen rijtema etc de bruin and lablans 1998 feng et al 2018 priestley and taylor 1972 the radiation based and temperature based models with fewer parameter inputs are relatively more commonly used to estimate et0 among the radiation based models the hargreaves hs model is often used to estimate et0 because of its simple structure and high accuracy of prediction luo et al 2014 almorox et al 2015 feng et al 2016 evaluated 11 empirical et0 models and found that the prediction accuracy of hargreaves priestley taylor and markkink models were higher tabari et al 2012 compared the performances of priestley taylor markkink jensen haise and sch models to estimate et0 and it suggests that the priestley taylor model performed best sixteen empirical et0 models were evaluated by djaman et al 2015 and the results showed that all those models overestimated or underestimated et0 therefore it is necessary to develop new models to accurately estimate et0 in the absence of meteorological data in recent decades with the rapid development of computer technology and artificial intelligence researchers began to apply classical extreme learning machine elm and deep learning dl in hydrology and meteorology dou and yang 2018 fan et al 2019a c feng et al 2019a kalteh 2016 previous studies have also showed that artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm extreme learning machine elm and random forest rf were able to accurately predict et0 gao et al 2021 gong et al 2021 and machine learning models presented better performance than empirical models szegedy et al 2013 kalteh 2016 karandish and šimůnek 2016 wen et al 2015 used support vector machine svm and empirical hargreaves priestley taylor models for evaluating the computational accuracy of et0 it could be concluded that the performance of svm was better than that of empirical models previous studies also showed that artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm extreme learning machine elm and random forest rf were able to accurately predict et0 and machine learning models presented better performance than empirical models szegedy et al 2013 kalteh et al 2016 karandish et al 2016 in addition the structures of support vector machine svm and random forest rf model were relatively simpler but could not capture time information fan et al 2018a fan et al 2018b saggi and jain 2019 abdullah et al 2015 evaluated the extreme learning machine elm model for et0 estimation the results showed that the elm model had excellent performance in et0 modeling to a large extent the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models depend on the internal model parameters the model parameters must be determined in real time to effectively improve the accuracy of machine learning simulation the model calibration methods are mainly based on grid search and gradient descent algorithms bui et al 2020 lee et al 2020 kao et al 2020 however the calculation process of these algorithms is more complex and prone to local convergence in contrast the biological heuristic algorithms have been proved to be more accurate and efficient which can provide the global optimal solution for the optimization problem the combination of biological heuristic algorithms and machine learning models can reduce the optimal solution of the optimization problem as well as improve the computing speed and the performance of the model biological heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga yin et al 2017 particle swarm optimization pso petković et al 2016 and artificial bee colony abc ozkan et al 2011 syed et al 2020 can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning models for estimating et0 fahimi et al 2017 yan et al 2019 based on the measured data of pan evaporation ghorbani et al 2018b proposed a multi layer perceptron fast fold algorithm hybrid model mlp ffa to predict daily evaporation it was found that the hybrid mlp ffa model performed better than the classical multi layer perceptron mlp model shamshirband et al 2015 combined the artificial neural network ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis models with the cuckoo search optimization algorithm csa to predict monthly et0 in serbia it was found that the csa algorithm was able to effectively improve the prediction accuracy of the anfis model

demonstrated that the accuracy of the hybrid anfis ffa model was higher than that of the original anfis model as an effective machine learning model extreme learning machine elm can accurately predict et0 however further studies need to be conducted to explore the elm model based on kernel function nevertheless the kernel function still has some limitations on parameter optimization huang 2014 wu et al 2020 in this study the biological heuristic algorithms were coupled with the elm model which could effectively solve the limitations of the model parameters therefore the main purposes of this

into five climatic zones namely the mountain plateau region mpz temperate continental zone tcz temperate monsoon zone tmz subtropical monsoon region smz and tropical monsoon region tpmz in addition considering the feasibility of land area and data tropical monsoon region tpmz can be incorporated into subtropical monsoon region smz for research and analysis fan et al 2016 wu et al 2019a wu et al

crop evapotranspiration estimation 2 3 1 fao 56 penman monteith model the penman monteith model recommended by fao has been widely used to estimate daily et0 in many previous studies therefore et0

layer neural network model compared with the traditional bp neural network model or support vector machine the hidden layer parameters of the elm model are randomly selected which needs no subsequent adjustment operation and has faster learning efficiency in addition the performance is better than the traditional neural network model feng et al 2019b 2020 the elm model is mainly composed of the input layer meteorological variables the hidden layer neurons and the output layer et0 as shown in fig 2 an improved elm model algorithm huang et al 2014a was proposed by combining traditional elm with kernel function and introducing optimization parameters in order to further improve the learning ability and stability of the model the elm model based on kernel function maps the input samples from the input space to the high dimensional hidden layer feature space and different kernel function mappings are random huang et al 2019 assuming there is a data set z i t i z i r d t i r m i 1 n where n is the real sequence d is the input dimension m is the output dimension and the specific expression of the elm function is shown in eq 7 7 f z i 1 l β i h i z w i b i h z β where l is the number of hidden layer nodes β β 1 β 2 β l is the weight vector connecting the hidden layer and the output layer and ω and b are the parameters hi z wi bi is the output of the i hidden node relative to the input node z the goal of the elm model is to minimize the error of the training cycle while minimizing the output weight such as eq 8 huang et al 2019 8 min β 1 2 β 2 c 2 i 1 n ε i 2 9 h i z i β t i ε i i 1 2 n where c is a normalized parameter which is used to weight between the output weight and the training error according to kkt s theorem training elm is equivalent to solving dual optimization problems the specific expression is shown eq 9 10 l dlem 1 2 β 2 c 2 i 1 n ε i 2 i 1 n j 1 m α i j h i z i β j t i j ε i j when the training sample size is large the eq 10 can be obtained 11 f z h z h t i c h h t 1 t if h z is unknown and is an implicit function according to the mercer condition huang et al 2006 it can be applied into elm to define a kernel matrix for elm as shown in eq 11 12 k elm h h t k elmi j h z i h z j k z i z j by substituting eqs 10 and 11 into eq 7 the kernel function of the output function is obtained as shown in eq 12 13 f x k z z 1 k z z n t i c h h t 1 t when the kernel function model is complex the k z is unknown which is usually calculated based on the radial basis function the specific expression is shown in the eq 13 14 k z z j exp γ z z j 2 2 σ 2 where c and γ are two parameters of elm model which usually have no physical meaning three biological heuristic algorithms are used to optimize the optimal parameters of elm the optimization process is shown in fig 3 2 5 intelligent optimization algorithms 2 5 1 genetic algorithm genetic algorithm ga was proposed by holland et al 1975 to find the optimal solution by simulating the process of biological evolution genetic algorithm starts from a population that optimizes the potential solution of the problem a population is composed of many genes and each individual is an entity with chromosome characteristics the mapping from appearance to genotype must be carried out from the beginning after population initialization better and better approximate solutions are produced according to the principle of survival of the fittest which makes the solutions be close to the objective function in each generation according to individual fitness crossover and mutation are based on the theory of natural genetics and a new population created represents a new solution this process will ensure that offspring populations are more adaptable than previous generations the optimal individual in the last generation is regarded as the approximate optimal solution of the optimization problem for more details on genetic algorithms see holland 1975 2 5 2 particle swarm optimization algorithm particle swarm optimization pso is an optimization algorithm based on population foraging proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 each bird is a particle and the whole bird swarm forms a particle swarm in the particle swarm optimization algorithm each particle is a potential solution to the problem and corresponds to the fitness value determined by the fitness function in addition each particle has a velocity which determines the direction and distance of the particle s motion in the multi dimensional search space and the speed is affected by the particle s inertia in each iteration the particle swarm optimization algorithm updates its speed and position through a single extremum pbest and a global extremum gbest nedic et al 2014 the optimal solution is obtained by jumping out of the iteration after the predetermined conditions are satisfied for more details on pso see huang and he 2018 2 5 3 artificial bee colony abc artificial bee colony abc was proposed by karaboga and basturk 2008 based on the foraging behavior of honeybees honeybees are divided into three types by simulating the honey collection mechanism of actual honeybees collecting bees observing bees and scouting bees it is assumed that the solution space of the problem are d dimensional and the number of collecting bees and observation bees is both sn besides the number of observation bees is equal to the number of honey sources the position of each honey source represents a possible solution the nectar amount of the honey source correlates with the fitness of the corresponding solution and the honeybee correlates with the honey source the honeybee corresponding to the i honey source looks for a new honey source according to the eq 14 15 x id x id φ id x id x kd where i 1 2 sn d 1 2 d φ id is a random number on the interval 1 1 k i the abc algorithm compares the newly generated possible solution x i x i 1 x i 2 x id with the original solution x i x i 1 x i 2 x id and uses a greedy selection strategy to retain the better solution each observation bee selects a honey source according to probability as shown in eq 15 16 p i f i t i j 1 sn f i t i where f i t i is the fitness value of the possible solution xi for the selected honey source the observation bee searches for a new possible solution according to the probability formula if the fitness value of a honey source is not improved within a given step the honey source will be discarded when all honeybees and observation bees search the complete space while the corresponding honey source becomes a scout bee the scout bee searches for a new possible solution based on eq 16 17 x id x d min γ x d max x d min the interval of γ in the equation is the random numbers of 0 1 x d min and x d max are the lower and upper bounds of the d dimension for more details on abc see syed et al 2020 2 6 performance evaluation four statistical indexes were used to evaluate the accuracy of models day et0 simulation fan et

higher the prediction accuracy is however the lower the rmse nrmse and mae are the better the model performance is the global performance index gpi was used to evaluate the comprehensive accuracy performance of each model in order to avoid the difference between individual indicators which is expressed as follows 22 gpi j 1 4 î j y j y ij where the index α j of r 2 is equal to 1 and all other indicators α j are equal to 1 yj is the median of the scale value of index j and yij is the scale value of index j of model i the higher the gpi value is the higher the accuracy of the model is 3

the least accuracy was obtained by the three empirical models h s p t and makkink with r 2 rmse nrmse mae and gpi of 0 835 0 866 0 435 1 951 mm d 27 084 55 006 1 006 4 533 mm d and 3 858 1 818 respectively as shown in table 5 the estimation accuracy of the three hybrid elm models ga elm abc elm and pso elm was also the highest in tmz in the training and testing phases with r 2 rmse nrmse mae and gpi ranging 0 974 0 999 0 046 0 963 mm d 14 382 24 512 0 123 0 944 mm d and 0 623 2 381 respectively the values of r 2 rmse nrmse mae and gpi of the standalone elm model were 0 972 0 979 0 372 0 736 mm d 21 981 33 301 0 338 0 996 mm d and 0 338 0 996 respectively the empirical models h s p t and makkink showed the least accuracy in et0 estimation with r 2 rmse nrmse mae and gpi of 0 832 0 858 0 722 1 372 mm d 30 846 63 498 0 410 2 313 mm d and 3 787 1 040 respectively it can be concluded form table 6 that the estimation accuracy of the three hybrid elm models was the best in smz with r2 rmse nrmse mae and gpi of 0 957 0 998 0 121 0 430 mm d 5 036 21 754 mm d 0 113 0 350 mm d and 0 041 2 733 respectively followed by the standalone elm model r2 rmse nrmse mae and gpi ranging 0 954 0

243 mm d 36 218 61 065 mm d 1 218 6 065 mm d and 3 685 1 956 respectively it can be seen from tables 3 6 that the estimation accuracy of pso elm model was the best followed by the ga elm model and the abc elm model and the elm model performed less accurate with r2 of 0 991 0 983 0 979 and 0 968 rmse of 0 253 mm d 0 287 mm d 0 337 mm d and 0 377 mm d nrmse of 13 193 15 844 16 585 and 22 387 mae of 0

least accurate in different climatic zones in china among the hybrid models the accuracy of the pso elm model was the highest followed by ga elm and abc elm models fig 4 shows the degree of fitting between the daily et0 values estimated by the hybrid elm models and the p m model at the representative stations in different climatic zones of china as can be seen from fig 4 compared with the hybrid elm models the prediction results of the standalone elm model were underestimated in different climatic zones the estimated results at urumqi harbin beijing and wuhan showed larger underestimations which were mainly affected by meteorological factors such as temperature humidity wind speed thick clouds and air pollution meanwhile the hybrid elm models were able to overcome the influence of the environment on meteorological data in the process of et0 simulation and the biological heuristic algorithms could improve the simulation accuracy of the elm model in an all round way fig 4 shows that the pso elm model had the highest accuracy followed by the ga elm and abc elm models among the hybrid models fig 5 shows the fitting degree of the simulated values of the three empirical models p t h s and makkink models with et0 obtained by p m model in different climatic zones in china as can be seen from fig 5 the p t and h s models generally overestimated et0 in the four climatic zones of china except that underestimated et0 at jiuzhi which was mainly due to the influence of the climatic conditions of the station the average annual temperature of the station was 1 79 c with the wind speed at the height of 2 m of 1 11 m s the annual relative humidity of 72 84 and the annual rainfall of 758 04 mm these factors inhibited the evapotranspiration of the station the overestimation or underestimation of makkink model was significant in different climatic zones of china which mainly depended on solar radiation affected by latitude sunshine hours air pollution and other factors from the analysis of the model structures as is shown in fig 6 taylor chart with the two dimensional spatial dimension was applied to visualize the performance of p m three hybrid models pso elm abc elm and ga elm and elm model and three empirical models p t h s and makkink for estimating et0 in different climatic zones of china results demonstrated that the daily et0 values simulated by the hybrid models pso elm ga elm and abc elm were closer to the reference position at each site and the pso elm and ga elm models were the closest indicating that they had better accuracy than standalone elm and empirical models this study was aimed to evaluate the et0 estimation performance of different models with limited meteorological parameter inputs in different climatic zones pso elm model was used to simulate daily et0 under eight m1 m8 meteorological parameter input combinations with m1 containing rs m2 containing u2 m3 containing rh m4 containing tmax m5 containing tmin m6 containing tmax and tmin m7 containing tmax tmin and rh m8 containing tmax tmin rh and u2 table 7 shows the statistical performance of the pso elm model for estimating daily et0 under the eight input combinations in different climatic zones tcz mpz tmz and smz of china the input combination m8 presented the highest accuracy in tcz smz mpz and tmz with r2 of 0 938 0 886 0 846 and 0 917 rmse of 0 539 mm d 0 512 mm d 0 508 mm d and 0 536 mm d gpi of 0 643 1 635 0 748 and 1 332 respectively under the input combination of tmax tmin and rh m7 the simulation accuracy in tcz smz and tmz had also reached a great level with r2 of 0 892 0 866 and 0 870 rmse of 0 773 mm d 0 597 mm d and 0 832 mm d gpi of 0 086 1 342 and 0 571 respectively the estimation accuracy was higher in mpz when only tmax tmin data m6 were available with r 2 of 0 808 rmse of 0 651 mm d gpi of 0 176 which could reflect the evapotranspiration of different climate zones under the single parameter input combinations the simulation accuracy of m1 was higher in tcz with r2 of 0 866 rmse of 0 790 mm d gpi of 0 042 the simulation accuracy of m4 was higher in mpz smz and tmz with r2 of 0 755 0 763 and 0 731 rmse of 0 632 mm d 0 748 mm d and 0 949 mm d gpi of 0 161 0 722 and 0 110 respectively therefore under the conditions with fewer meteorological element inputs using tmax tmin and rh as the input variables could more accurately reflect the evapotranspiration of different climatic zones in china and the input cost was the lowest 4 discussion 4 1 the simulation accuracy of elm models was higher than that of empirical models in different climates it was found in this study that daily et0 simulation accuracy of extreme learning machine was higher than that of empirical models it is mainly because the et0 simulation process is a complex nonlinear regression process that takes many factors into account the empirical models have the characteristics of regional differences which greatly limits the scope of model application however the extreme learning machine has high accuracy in dealing with the nonlinear relationship between dependent variables and independent variables which can effectively capture time information and has the advantages of good stability strong robustness and fast computational speed wu et al 2019a wu et al 2019b kisi 2015 wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b abdullah et al 2015 used the elm model to simulate the daily et0 in iraqi and proved its superiority over the back propagation ffbp model it showed that the elm model had higher computational speed and good scope of application gocic et al 2016 applied elm hargreaves priestley taylor and turc models with the meteorological data from 1980 to 2010 to predict monthly et0 at two weather stations in serbia the accuracy of monthly et0 predicted by the elm model was better than that of empirical models feng et al 2016 compared the calculation accuracy of elm back propagation neural network gann based on genetic algorithm wavelet neural network wnn and empirical models for predicting daily et0 in southwest china the results demonstrated that the elm and gann models had higher prediction accuracy than that of wnn and empirical models feng et al 2017c used meteorological data to predict daily et0 in the sichuan basin based on elm and generalized regression neural network grnn indicating that daily et0 estimated by the elm model was more accurate than that simulated by the grnn model hargreaves model and calibrated hargreaves models in this study daily et0 estimation of extreme learning machine presented better performance than empirical models in different climatic zones 4 2 the accuracy of elm simulation was significantly improved by biological heuristic algorithms in this study it was found that integrating biological heuristic algorithms pso ga abc with elm effectively improved the simulation accuracy of the elm model it is known that the accuracy of et0 estimated by extreme learning machine mainly depends on the internal kernel function which is complex in structure and needs to be determined in real time while the biological heuristic algorithms have strong global convergence ability in the case of limited meteorological data the particle swarm optimization algorithm pso coupled with elm model was used to predict et0 in northwest china by zhu et al 2020 and it proved that the hybrid elm model had high simulation accuracy yin et al 2017b developed a hybrid svm ga model suitable for et0 prediction in arid areas of china the results showed that the simulation accuracy of the new model was greatly improved with rmse and r2 values of 0 138 mm d and 0 995 respectively the accuracy of the new model was about 10 higher than that of the original svm model under the complete input of meteorological variables petković et al 2016 used particle swarm optimization algorithm coupled with the rbf model to predict et0 in serbia it was found that the simulation accuracy of the optimized rbf model was higher with rmse and r2 value of 0 05 mm d and 0 97 respectively however some scholars believed that the optimization algorithms could not improve the performance of the model compared with the traditional methods the main reason was when the biological heuristic algorithms were coupled with the machine learning models it would fall into the local optimal solution compared with the original model the accuracy was not significantly improved this study showed that pso and ga algorithms had better ability in optimizing the parameters of the elm model and the simulation accuracy of pso elm and ga elm was closer to previous studies 4 3 the pso elm model realized the accurate et0 estimation with fewer parameter inputs the input type of meteorological parameters plays an important role in the simulation of daily et0 it was found in this study that the daily et0 values simulated by the pso elm model were more consistent with the calculated values of fao 56 pm model in different climatic zones in china when tmax tmin rh u2 rs were used as the input factors when tmax tmin rh were the input factors this hybrid method could also obtain satisfying results in areas where meteorological variables such as wind speed relative humidity and global solar radiation were unavailable and only data of air temperature could be easily obtained the et0 values estimated by the pso elm model were still acceptable in different climatic zones feng et al 2017a selected the southwest humid area as the study area and set tmax and tmin as the input variables to estimate et0 based on random forest rf and the generalized regression neural network grnn model it was found that the et0 estimating of these models had high accuracy and could provide important data support for regional water resources management these results showed that for the et0 estimation global solar radiation was a more important parameter than temperature in tcz of china opposite to other climatic zones which were consistent with the previous studies tabari et al 2012 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 it was concluded that the pso elm model could accurately estimate et0 with fewer meteorological element inputs however the contributions of different meteorological parameters to estimate et0 varied in different climatic conditions 5 conclusions based on three biological heuristic algorithms pso ga and abc to optimize elm model pso elm ga elm and abc elm models were proposed to improve the daily et0 estimation accuracy of the elm model and compared their performances with standalone elm and three empirical models hargreaves priestley talor and makkink models in four different climatic zones of china the main conclusions are as follows 1 hybrid elm models pso elm ga elm and abc elm were proposed for estimating et0 in different climate zones of china among them the prediction accuracy of pso elm model was the best followed by ga elm and abc elm models with r2 of 0 994 0 981 and 0 978 in tcz r2 of 0 993 0 988 and 0 985 in mpz r2 of 0 990 0 983 and 0 979 in smz and r2 of 0 983 0 978 and 0 977 in tmz respectively 2 the hybrid elm models performed better than the standalone elm model while the empirical models were the least accurate among the three types of models in tcz mpz tmz and smz the r2 values of hybrid elm models were 0 973 0 994 0 981 0 996 0 974 0 998 and 0 977 0 998 respectively while r2 values of standalone elm model was 0 966 0 974 0 955 0 989 0 972 0 973 and 0 957 0 966 respectively the r2 of empirical models were 0 821 0 889 0 835 0 866 0 835 0 858 and 0 831 0 869 respectively 3 due to different input factors and main driving factors of the region the pso elm model performed the best in estimating et0 in tcz smz and tmz climatic zones when only setting tmax tmin and rh as input parameters with r2 of 0 892 0 866 and 0 870 respectively and it showed the best performance in the mpz climatic zones when only setting tmax and tmin as input parameters with r2 of 0 808 credit authorship contribution statement zongjun wu formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing ningbo cui supervision funding acquisition project

0 955 0 989 in four climatic regions in china the estimation accuracy of the empirical models was relatively lower with r2 of 0 822 0 887 and rmse of 0 381 1 951 mm d the r 2 values of pso elm ga elm and abc elm models were 0 993 0 986 and 0 981 and the rmse values were 0 266 mm d 0 306 mm d and 0 404 mm d respectively indicating that the pso elm model had the best performance when setting tmax tmin and rh as the model inputs the pso elm model presented better performance in the temperate continental zone tcz subtropical monsoon region smz and temperate monsoon zone tmz climate zones with r

with r2 of 0 808 and rmse of 0 651 mm d all the three biological heuristic algorithms effectively improved the performance of the elm model particularly the pso elm was recommended as a promising

machine elm genetic algorithm ga artificial bee colony abc particle swarm optimization algorithm pso hybrid model 1 introduction reference crop evapotranspiration et0 mainly includes soil surface evaporation and vegetation transpiration which is an important index for farmland precision irrigation decision making irrigation system optimization and regional water resources management wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b yan et al 2019 ferreira et al 2019 wu et al 2019a wu et al 2019b accurate estimation of et0 is of great significance for real time accurate irrigation decision making and improvement of irrigation water efficiency model development feng et al 2017a zhang et al 2018 the penman monteith p m model proposed by fao in 1998 considering both thermodynamics and dynamics has been widely used as the standard model for et0 estimation in different regions of the world allen et al 1998 however the calculation of the p m model needs diverse meteorological parameters such as maximum and minimum temperatures wind speed relative humidity and net radiation fan et al 2016 which greatly limits its global application feng et al 2017b the et0 models are roughly divided into four categories aerodynamic based models albrecht brockamp wenner harbeck etc temperature based models baier robertson hamon romanenko and hargreaves etc radiation based models priestley taylor markkink and jensen haise etc and hybrid models penman monteith wright jensen rijtema etc de bruin and lablans 1998 feng et al 2018 priestley and taylor 1972 the radiation based and temperature based models with fewer parameter inputs are relatively more commonly used to estimate et0 among the radiation based models the hargreaves hs model is often used to estimate et0 because of its simple structure and high accuracy of prediction luo et al 2014 almorox et al 2015 feng et al 2016 evaluated 11 empirical et0 models and found that the prediction accuracy of hargreaves priestley taylor and markkink models were higher tabari et al 2012 compared the performances of priestley taylor markkink jensen haise and sch models to estimate et0 and it suggests that the priestley taylor model performed best sixteen empirical et0 models were evaluated by djaman et al 2015 and the results showed that all those models overestimated or underestimated et0 therefore it is necessary to develop new models to accurately estimate et0 in the absence of meteorological data in recent decades with the rapid development of computer technology and artificial intelligence researchers began to apply classical extreme learning machine elm and deep learning dl in hydrology and meteorology dou and yang 2018 fan et al 2019a c feng et al 2019a kalteh 2016 previous studies have also showed that artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm extreme learning machine elm and random forest rf were able to accurately predict et0 gao et al 2021 gong et al 2021 and machine learning models presented better performance than empirical models szegedy et al 2013 kalteh 2016 karandish and šimůnek 2016 wen et al 2015 used support vector machine svm and empirical hargreaves priestley taylor models for evaluating the computational accuracy of et0 it could be concluded that the performance of svm was better than that of empirical models previous studies also showed that artificial neural network ann support vector machine svm extreme learning machine elm and random forest rf were able to accurately predict et0 and machine learning models presented better performance than empirical models szegedy et al 2013 kalteh et al 2016 karandish et al 2016 in addition the structures of support vector machine svm and random forest rf model were relatively simpler but could not capture time information fan et al 2018a fan et al 2018b saggi and jain 2019 abdullah et al 2015 evaluated the extreme learning machine elm model for et0 estimation the results showed that the elm model had excellent performance in et0 modeling to a large extent the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models depend on the internal model parameters the model parameters must be determined in real time to effectively improve the accuracy of machine learning simulation the model calibration methods are mainly based on grid search and gradient descent algorithms bui et al 2020 lee et al 2020 kao et al 2020 however the calculation process of these algorithms is more complex and prone to local convergence in contrast the biological heuristic algorithms have been proved to be more accurate and efficient which can provide the global optimal solution for the optimization problem the combination of biological heuristic algorithms and machine learning models can reduce the optimal solution of the optimization problem as well as improve the computing speed and the performance of the model biological heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm ga yin et al 2017 particle swarm optimization pso petković et al 2016 and artificial bee colony abc ozkan et al 2011 syed et al 2020 can significantly improve the prediction accuracy of machine learning models for estimating et0 fahimi et al 2017 yan et al 2019 based on the measured data of pan evaporation ghorbani et al 2018b proposed a multi layer perceptron fast fold algorithm hybrid model mlp ffa to predict daily evaporation it was found that the hybrid mlp ffa model performed better than the classical multi layer perceptron mlp model shamshirband et al 2015 combined the artificial neural network ann and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis models with the cuckoo search optimization algorithm csa to predict monthly et0 in serbia it was found that the csa algorithm was able to effectively improve the prediction accuracy of the anfis model yin et al 2017 combined support vector machine svm with the genetic algorithm ga to predict daily et0 in the semi arid mountain area which proved the superiority of support vector machine genetic algorithm svm ga for predicting et0 tao et al 2018 proposed adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis based on fast fold algorithm ffa for daily et0 prediction in burkina faso the result demonstrated that the accuracy of the hybrid anfis ffa model was higher than that of the original anfis model as an effective machine learning model extreme learning machine elm can accurately predict et0 however further studies need to be conducted to explore the elm model based on kernel function nevertheless the kernel function still has some limitations on parameter optimization huang 2014 wu et al 2020 in this study the biological heuristic algorithms were coupled with the elm model which could effectively solve the limitations of the model parameters therefore the main purposes of this study were as follows 1 to evaluate the accuracy of three biological heuristic algorithms ga pso and abc for optimizing the elm model in daily et0 estimation in different climatic zones of china 2 to compare the performances of three hybrid elm models standalone elm model and threes empirical models for et0 estimation with limited meteorological parameters 3 to recommend the optimal machine learning model and parameter input combination for estimating et0 in different climatic zones of china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area according to the climate difference china can be divided into five climatic zones namely the mountain plateau region mpz temperate continental zone tcz temperate monsoon zone tmz subtropical monsoon region smz and tropical monsoon region tpmz in addition considering the feasibility of land area and data tropical monsoon region tpmz can be incorporated into subtropical monsoon region smz for research and analysis fan et al 2016 wu et al 2019a wu et al 2019b tcz mpz tmz and smz are defined as arid semi arid semi humid and humid regions respectively twelve representative meteorological stations were selected across different climatic zones of china

each station are described in table 1 and the data set for model training and testing phase are shown in table 2 the missing data accounted for about 1 9 of the total data which were made up by the interpolation method and the empirical models were calculated using the data from 2010 to 2019 the input data of machine learning models were the same tmax tmin u2 rh and rs 2 3 models for reference crop evapotranspiration estimation 2 3 1 fao 56 penman monteith model the penman monteith model recommended by fao has been widely used to estimate daily et0 in many previous studies therefore et0 values estimated by the p m model were selected as the targets for the calibration and evaluation of proposed models in this study li et al 2012 kisi 2015 fan et al 2016 the specific expression is shown in eq 1 1 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t mean 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where et0 is reference evapotranspiration mm d r n is net radiation mj m2 d g is soil heat flux density mj m2 d tmean is

evapotranspiration estimation model hargreaves samani based on maximum and minimum temperatures and surface radiation data as shown in eq 2 2 et 0 0 0023 t mean 17 8 t max t min 0 5 r a where tmean tmax and tmin are the average maximum and minimum temperature c r a is the surface radiation mj m2 d and the calculation process is shown in eq 3 3 r a 24 60 π g sc d r ω s sin φ sin δ cos φ cos δ sin

is the sunset angle rad based on air temperature and solar radiation data the priestley talor and makkink models were proposed which are expressed as eqs 4 and 5 4 et 0 1 26 δ δ γ r n g 5 et 0 0 61 δ δ γ r s 0 12 the explanations of δ γ and r n are the same as those in eq 1 g is assumed to be 0 allen et al 1998 r s is calculated by eq 6 6 r s a s b s n n r a where n is the actual sunshine hours h n is the maximum possible sunshine hours h a s and b s are regression constants 2 4 extreme learning machine elm extreme learning machine elm was developed by huang et al 2006 which is a single hidden layer neural network model compared with the traditional bp neural network model or support vector machine the hidden layer parameters of the elm model are randomly selected which needs no subsequent adjustment operation and has faster learning efficiency in addition the performance is better than the traditional neural network model feng et al 2019b 2020 the elm model is mainly composed of the input layer meteorological variables the hidden layer neurons and the output layer et0 as shown in fig 2 an improved elm model algorithm huang et al 2014a was proposed by combining traditional elm with kernel function and introducing optimization parameters in order to further improve the learning ability and stability of the model the elm model based on kernel function maps the input samples from the input space to the high dimensional hidden layer feature space and different kernel function mappings are random huang et al 2019 assuming there is a data set z i t i z i r d t i r m i 1 n where n is the real sequence d is the input dimension m is the output dimension and the specific expression of the elm function is shown in eq 7 7 f z i 1 l β i h i z w i b i h z β where l is the number of hidden layer nodes β β 1 β 2 β l is the weight vector connecting the hidden layer and the output layer and ω and b are the parameters hi z wi bi is the output of the i hidden node relative to the input node z the goal of the elm model is to minimize the error of the training cycle while minimizing the output weight such as eq 8 huang et al 2019 8 min β 1 2 β 2 c 2 i 1 n ε i 2 9 h i z i β t i ε i i 1 2 n where c is a normalized parameter which is used to weight between the output weight and the training error according to kkt s theorem training elm is equivalent to solving dual optimization problems the specific expression is shown eq 9 10 l dlem 1 2 β 2 c 2 i 1 n ε i 2 i 1 n j 1 m α i j h i z i β j t i j ε i j when the training sample size is large the eq 10 can be obtained 11 f z h z h t i c h h t 1 t if h z is unknown and is an implicit function according to the mercer condition huang et al 2006 it can be applied into elm to define a kernel matrix for elm as shown in eq 11 12 k elm h h t k elmi j h z i h z j k z i z j by substituting eqs 10 and 11 into eq 7 the kernel function of the output function is obtained as shown in eq 12 13 f x k z z 1 k z z n t i c h h t 1 t when the kernel function model is complex the k z is unknown which is usually calculated based on the radial basis function the specific expression is shown in the eq 13 14 k z z j exp γ z z j 2 2 σ 2 where c and γ are two parameters of elm model which usually have no physical meaning three biological heuristic algorithms are used to optimize the optimal parameters of elm the optimization process is shown in fig 3 2 5 intelligent optimization algorithms 2 5 1 genetic algorithm genetic algorithm ga was proposed by holland et al 1975 to find the optimal solution by simulating the process of biological evolution genetic algorithm starts from a population that optimizes the potential solution of the problem a population is composed of many genes and each individual is an entity with chromosome characteristics the mapping from appearance to genotype must be carried out from the beginning after population initialization better and better approximate solutions are produced according to the principle of survival of the fittest which makes the solutions be close to the objective function in each generation according to individual fitness crossover and mutation are based on the theory of natural genetics and a new population created represents a new solution this process will ensure that offspring populations are more adaptable than previous generations the optimal individual in the last generation is regarded as the approximate optimal solution of the optimization problem for more details on genetic algorithms see holland 1975 2 5 2 particle swarm optimization algorithm particle swarm optimization pso is an optimization algorithm based on population foraging proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 each bird is a particle and the whole bird swarm forms a particle swarm in the particle swarm optimization algorithm each particle is a potential solution to the problem and corresponds to the fitness value determined by the fitness function in addition each particle has a velocity which determines the direction and distance of the particle s motion in the multi dimensional search space and the speed is affected by the particle s inertia in each iteration the particle swarm optimization algorithm updates its speed and position through a single extremum pbest and a global extremum gbest nedic et al 2014 the optimal solution is obtained by jumping out of the iteration after the predetermined conditions are satisfied for more details on pso see huang and he 2018 2 5 3 artificial bee colony abc artificial bee colony abc was proposed by karaboga and basturk 2008 based on the foraging behavior of honeybees honeybees are divided into three types by simulating the honey collection mechanism of actual honeybees collecting bees observing bees and scouting bees it is assumed that the solution space of the problem are d dimensional and the number of collecting bees and observation bees is both sn besides the number of observation bees is equal to the number of honey sources the position of each honey source represents a possible solution the nectar amount of the honey source correlates with the fitness of the corresponding solution and the honeybee correlates with the honey source the honeybee corresponding to the i honey source looks for a new honey source according to the eq 14 15 x id x id φ id x id x kd where i 1 2 sn d 1 2 d φ id is a random number on the interval 1 1 k i the abc algorithm compares the newly generated possible solution x i x i 1 x i 2 x id with the original solution x i x i 1 x i 2 x id and uses a greedy selection strategy to retain the better solution each observation bee selects a honey source according to probability as shown in eq 15 16 p i f i t i j 1 sn f i t i where f i t i is the fitness value of the possible solution xi for the selected honey source the observation bee searches for a new possible solution according to the probability formula if the fitness value of a honey source is not improved within a given step the honey source will be discarded when all honeybees and observation bees search the complete space while the corresponding honey source becomes a scout bee the scout bee searches for a new possible solution based on eq 16 17 x id x d min γ x d max x d min the interval of γ in the equation is the random numbers of 0 1 x d min and x d max are the lower and upper bounds of the d dimension for more details on abc see syed et al 2020 2 6 performance evaluation four statistical indexes were used to evaluate the accuracy of models day et0 simulation fan et

higher the prediction accuracy is however the lower the rmse nrmse and mae are the better the model performance is the global performance index gpi was used to evaluate the comprehensive accuracy performance of each model in order to avoid the difference between individual indicators which is expressed as follows 22 gpi j 1 4 î j y j y ij where the index α j of r 2 is equal to 1 and all other indicators α j are equal to 1 yj is the median of the scale value of index j and yij is the scale value of index j of model i the higher the gpi value is the higher the accuracy of the model is 3

the least accuracy was obtained by the three empirical models h s p t and makkink with r 2 rmse nrmse mae and gpi of 0 835 0 866 0 435 1 951 mm d 27 084 55 006 1 006 4 533 mm d and 3 858 1 818 respectively as shown in table 5 the estimation accuracy of the three hybrid elm models ga elm abc elm and pso elm was also the highest in tmz in the training and testing phases with r 2 rmse nrmse mae and gpi ranging 0 974 0 999 0 046 0 963 mm d 14 382 24 512 0 123 0 944 mm d and 0 623 2 381 respectively the values of r 2 rmse nrmse mae and gpi of the standalone elm model were 0 972 0 979 0 372 0 736 mm d 21 981 33 301 0 338 0 996 mm d and 0 338 0 996 respectively the empirical models h s p t and makkink showed the least accuracy in et0 estimation with r 2 rmse nrmse mae and gpi of 0 832 0 858 0 722 1 372 mm d 30 846 63 498 0 410 2 313 mm d and 3 787 1 040 respectively it can be concluded form table 6 that the estimation accuracy of the three hybrid elm models was the best in smz with

243 mm d 36 218 61 065 mm d 1 218 6 065 mm d and 3 685 1 956 respectively it can be seen from tables 3 6 that the estimation accuracy of pso elm model was the best followed by the ga elm model and the abc elm model and the elm model performed less accurate with r2 of 0 991 0 983 0 979 and 0 968 rmse of 0 253 mm d 0 287 mm d 0 337 mm d and 0 377 mm d nrmse of 13 193 15 844 16 585 and 22 387 mae of 0

between the daily et0 values estimated by the hybrid elm models and the p m model at the representative stations in different climatic zones of china as can be seen from fig 4 compared with the hybrid elm models the prediction results of the standalone elm model were underestimated in different climatic zones the estimated results at urumqi harbin beijing and wuhan showed larger underestimations which were mainly affected by meteorological factors such as temperature humidity wind speed thick clouds and air pollution meanwhile the hybrid elm models were able to overcome the influence of the environment on meteorological data in the process of et0 simulation and the biological heuristic algorithms could improve the simulation accuracy of the elm model in an all round way fig 4 shows that the pso elm model had the highest accuracy followed by the ga elm and abc elm models among the hybrid models fig 5 shows the fitting degree of the simulated values of the three empirical models p t h s and makkink models with et0 obtained by p m model in different climatic zones in china as can be seen from fig 5 the p t and h s models generally overestimated et0 in the four climatic zones of china except that underestimated et0 at jiuzhi which was mainly due to the influence of the climatic conditions of the station the average annual temperature of the station was 1 79 c with the wind speed at the height of 2 m of 1 11 m s the annual relative humidity of 72 84 and the annual rainfall of 758 04 mm these factors inhibited the evapotranspiration of the station the overestimation or underestimation of makkink model was significant in different climatic zones of china which mainly depended on solar radiation affected by latitude sunshine hours air pollution and other factors from the analysis of the model structures as is shown in fig 6 taylor chart with the two dimensional spatial dimension was applied to visualize the performance of p m three hybrid models pso elm abc elm and ga elm and elm model and three empirical models p t h s and makkink for estimating et0 in different climatic zones of china results demonstrated that the daily et0 values simulated by the hybrid models pso elm ga elm and abc elm were closer to the reference position at each site and the pso elm and ga elm models were the closest indicating that they had better accuracy than standalone elm and empirical models this study was aimed to evaluate the et0 estimation performance of different models with limited meteorological parameter inputs in different climatic zones pso elm model was used to simulate daily et0 under eight m1 m8 meteorological parameter input combinations with m1 containing rs m2 containing u2 m3 containing rh m4 containing tmax m5 containing tmin m6 containing tmax and tmin m7 containing tmax tmin and rh m8 containing tmax tmin rh and u2 table 7 shows the statistical performance of the pso elm model for estimating daily et0 under the eight input combinations in different climatic zones tcz mpz tmz and smz of china the input combination m8 presented the highest accuracy in tcz smz mpz and tmz with r2 of 0 938 0 886 0 846 and 0 917 rmse of 0 539 mm d 0 512 mm d 0 508 mm d and 0 536 mm d gpi of 0 643 1 635 0 748 and 1 332 respectively under the input combination of tmax tmin and rh m7 the simulation accuracy in tcz smz and tmz had also reached a great level with r2 of 0 892 0 866 and 0 870 rmse of 0 773 mm d 0 597 mm d and 0 832 mm d gpi of 0 086 1 342 and 0 571 respectively the estimation accuracy was higher in mpz when only tmax tmin data m6 were available with r 2 of 0 808 rmse of 0 651 mm d gpi of 0 176 which could reflect the evapotranspiration of different climate zones under the single parameter input combinations the simulation accuracy of m1 was higher in tcz with r2 of 0 866 rmse of 0 790 mm d gpi of 0 042 the simulation accuracy of m4 was higher in mpz smz and tmz with r2 of 0 755 0 763 and 0 731 rmse of 0 632 mm d 0 748 mm d and 0 949 mm d gpi of 0 161 0 722 and 0 110 respectively therefore under the conditions with fewer meteorological element inputs using tmax tmin and rh as the input variables could more accurately reflect the evapotranspiration of different climatic zones in china and the input cost was the lowest 4 discussion 4 1 the simulation accuracy of elm models was higher than that of empirical models in different climates it was found in this study that daily et0 simulation accuracy of extreme learning machine was higher than that of empirical models it is mainly because the et0 simulation process is a complex nonlinear regression process that takes many factors into account the empirical models have the characteristics of regional differences which greatly limits the scope of model application however the extreme learning machine has high accuracy in dealing with the nonlinear relationship between dependent variables and independent variables which can effectively capture time information and has the advantages of good stability strong robustness and fast computational speed wu et al 2019a wu et al 2019b kisi 2015 wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b abdullah et al 2015 used the elm model to simulate the daily et0 in iraqi and proved its superiority over the back propagation ffbp model it showed that the elm model had higher computational speed and good scope of application gocic et al 2016 applied elm hargreaves priestley taylor and turc models with the meteorological data from 1980 to 2010 to predict monthly et0 at two weather stations in serbia the accuracy of monthly et0 predicted by the elm model was better than that of empirical models feng et al 2016 compared the calculation accuracy of elm back propagation neural network gann based on genetic algorithm wavelet neural network wnn and empirical models for predicting daily et0 in southwest china the results demonstrated that the elm and gann models had higher prediction accuracy than that of wnn and empirical models feng et al 2017c used meteorological data to predict daily et0 in the sichuan basin based on elm and generalized regression neural network grnn indicating that daily et0 estimated by the elm model was more accurate than that simulated by the grnn model hargreaves model and calibrated hargreaves models in this study daily et0 estimation of extreme learning machine presented better performance than empirical models in different climatic zones 4 2 the accuracy of elm simulation was significantly improved by biological heuristic algorithms in this study it was found that integrating biological heuristic algorithms pso ga abc with elm effectively improved the simulation accuracy of the elm model it is known that the accuracy of et0 estimated by extreme learning machine mainly depends on the internal kernel function which is complex in structure and needs to be determined in real time while the biological heuristic algorithms have strong global convergence ability in the case of limited meteorological data the particle swarm optimization algorithm pso coupled with elm model was used to predict et0 in northwest china by zhu et al 2020 and it proved that the hybrid elm model had high simulation accuracy yin et al 2017b developed a hybrid svm ga model suitable for et0 prediction in arid areas of china the results showed that the simulation accuracy of the new model was greatly improved with rmse and r2 values of 0 138 mm d and 0 995 respectively the accuracy of the new model was about 10 higher than that of the original svm model under the complete input of meteorological variables petković et al 2016 used particle swarm optimization algorithm coupled with the rbf model to predict et0 in serbia it was found that the simulation accuracy of the optimized rbf model was higher with rmse and r2 value of 0 05 mm d and 0 97 respectively however some scholars believed that the optimization algorithms could not improve the performance of the model compared with the traditional methods the main reason was when the biological heuristic algorithms were coupled with the machine learning models it would fall into the local optimal solution compared with the original model the accuracy was not significantly improved this study showed that pso and ga algorithms had better ability in optimizing the parameters of the elm model and the simulation accuracy of pso elm and ga elm was closer to previous studies 4 3 the pso elm model realized the accurate et0 estimation with fewer parameter inputs the input type of meteorological parameters plays an important role in the simulation of daily et0 it was found in this study that the daily et0 values simulated by the pso elm model were more consistent with the calculated values of fao 56 pm model in different climatic zones in china when tmax tmin rh u2 rs were used as the input factors when tmax tmin rh were the input factors this hybrid method could also obtain satisfying results in areas where meteorological variables such as wind speed relative humidity and global solar radiation were unavailable and only data of air temperature could be easily obtained the et0 values estimated by the pso elm model were still acceptable in different climatic zones feng et al 2017a selected the southwest humid area as the study area and set tmax and tmin as the input variables to estimate et0 based on random forest rf and the generalized regression neural network grnn model it was found that the et0 estimating of these models had high accuracy and could provide important data support for regional water resources management these results showed that for the et0 estimation global solar radiation was a more important parameter than temperature in tcz of china opposite to other climatic zones which were consistent with the previous studies tabari et al 2012 antonopoulos and antonopoulos 2017 it was concluded that the pso elm model could accurately estimate et0 with fewer meteorological element inputs however the contributions of different meteorological parameters to estimate et0 varied in different climatic conditions 5 conclusions based on three biological heuristic algorithms pso ga and abc to optimize elm model pso elm ga elm and abc elm models were proposed to improve the daily et0 estimation accuracy of the elm model and compared their performances with standalone elm and three empirical models hargreaves priestley talor and makkink models in four different climatic zones of china the main conclusions are as follows 1 hybrid elm models pso elm ga elm and abc elm were proposed for estimating et0 in different climate zones of china among them the prediction accuracy of pso elm model was the best followed by ga elm and abc elm models with r2 of 0 994 0 981 and 0 978 in tcz r2 of 0 993 0 988 and 0 985 in mpz r2 of 0 990 0 983 and 0 979 in smz and r2 of 0 983 0 978 and 0 977 in tmz respectively 2 the hybrid elm models performed better than the standalone elm model while the empirical models were the least accurate among the three types of models in tcz mpz tmz and smz the r2 values of hybrid elm models were 0 973 0 994 0 981 0 996 0 974 0 998 and 0 977 0 998 respectively while r2 values of standalone elm model was 0 966 0 974 0 955 0 989 0 972 0 973 and 0 957 0 966 respectively the r2 of empirical models were 0 821 0 889 0 835 0 866 0 835 0 858 and 0 831 0 869 respectively 3 due to different input factors and main driving factors of the region the pso elm model performed the best in estimating et0 in tcz smz and tmz climatic zones when only setting tmax tmin and rh as input parameters with r2 of 0 892 0 866 and 0 870 respectively and it showed the best performance in the mpz climatic zones when only setting tmax and tmin as input parameters with r2 of 0 808 credit authorship contribution statement zongjun wu formal analysis writing original draft writing review editing ningbo cui supervision funding acquisition project

3907,springs are important source of fresh water for many regions of the world most mathematical models simulating spring discharge are linear and non linear reservoir based models that are simple and easy to use they however suffer from oversimplification and a lack of physical processes that limit their applicability the goal of this work is to present process based analytical model of discharge variation of multiple springs associated with a rectangular fractured aquifer subjected to arbitrary recharge the solution is obtained via laplace and fourier transformations along with the superposition principle and image well method for a constant flux point sink then the constant head point sink solution representing a single spring is obtained from the constant flux point sink solution finally the constant head point sink solution is extended to simulate the multiple constant head sinks or springs utilizing the principle of superposition and matrix solution the solution

basha 2020 to predict the spring discharge or to estimate the hydraulic and geometric parameters of the aquifers associated with springs an appropriate process based mathematical model and high quality data are needed the most well known model simulating the falling limb of spring hydrograph is the one presented by maillet 1905 although the linear reservoir model implying a linear relationship between the hydraulic head in the reservoir and its outflow was considered in developing this equation the key features of groundwater flow like darcy s law was neglected instead an empirical exponential function is considered to describe the falling limb where the discharge of spring is decreasing over time of the spring discharge by maillet 1905 the nonlinear power relationship between the storage and discharge was considered by coutagne 1948 mangin 1975 however proposed a hyperbolic function for the early time and exponential function for the late time recession of the spring discharge samani and ebrahimi 1996 added the flow rate or infiltration formula that was calculated utilizing the coutagne 1948 model to the mangin 1975 model to simulate the infiltration from the unsaturated or epikarst zone this makes their model more analytical in the sense that an infiltration equation is provided than that of mangin 1975 however samani and ebrahimi 1996 did not provide any further information on the aquifer than mangin 1975 furthermore the infiltration in the model of samani and ebrahimi 1996 never reaches zero so it has to be stopped artificially dewandel et al 2003 for more information on these models the reader may consult the following review papers basha 2020 fiorillo 2014 linear reservoirs of single and double porosity with single or multiple outlets were considered by hosseini and ataie ashtiani 2017 three parallel reservoirs of base flow intermediate flow and quick flow have been considered by hosseini et al 2017 to simulate the springe discharge all above mentioned works neglected the horizontal flow in the reservoir s thus these models are unable to accurately estimate the aquifer parameters especially when the horizontal component of flow is significant dewandel et al 2003 furthermore the reservoir based models e g maillet 1905 underestimates the dynamic volume of the aquifer storage dewandel et al 2003 which is the volume of drainable water over the elevation of a spring of concern the physically based recession flow solutions may be used to simulate the falling limb of the spring hydrograph and simple geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer were assumed in most of these models basha 2020 approximate solution of the groundwater flow equation boussinesq 1877 and nonlinear groundwater flow equation boussinesq 1904 were utilized to obtain aquifer recession flow instead of using temporal variation of discharge brutsaert and nieber 1977 suggested to utilize derivative of discharge with respect to time versus discharge curve they presented expressions for discharge derivative and discharge according to single reservoir and boussinesq s models they showed that single reservoir model is inadequate to describe the full range of recession flow using drought flow of six river basins this method was extended by troch et al 1993 to estimate hydraulic conductivity and depth to impervious layer using the base flow data they considered a rectangular homogeneous unconfined aquifer under the dupuit assumptions utilizing the method that is presented by troch et al 1993 one can estimate the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the average saturated thickness of the aquifer the method of troch et al 1993 was examined by szilagyi et al 1998 using a synthetic recession flow data generated by a numerical model they considered an aquifer with complex geometry gently sloping impervious layer and spatially variable hydraulic conductivity their work indicated that increasing the complexity of the aquifer did not affect the estimation of hydraulic conductivity and mean saturated thickness of the aquifer using the method suggested by troch et al 1993 hogarth et al 2014 extended the discharge derivative versus discharge curve for sloping aquifers to model the sloping aquifer they presented an approximation of the boussinesq s equation they explored the influences of the aquifer slope on the time derivative of the discharge the method suggested by brutsaert and nieber 1977 however was not applicable to significantly heterogenous aquifers rupp and selker 2006 biswal and nagesh kumar 2014 showed that degree of recharge and spatial variation of the rainfall cause deviation from recession flow suggested by brutsaert and nieber 1977 they showed that the amount of recharge and the recharge distribution affected the time derivate of discharge with a different manner a careful examination shows that the above mentioned works only concerned single porosity aquifers while double porosity fractured aquifer has never been considered the double porosity fractured aquifer considers two co existing continuums of fractures and rock matrix and the fracture continuum has a high permeability but low specific storage while the rock matrix continuum has a low permeability but high specific storage furthermore flow between rock matrix blocks is prohibited but flow between rock matrix blocks and fractures is permitted this is different from the double permeability fractured aquifer model in which flow between rock matrix blocks as well as flow between rock matrix blocks and fractures are both permitted kovács et al 2005 used a heat conduction model that is analogue to groundwater flow along with conduit flow to simulate the discharge of spring in karstic aquifers constant rate recharge was considered by kovács and perrochet 2008 the variable rate arbitrary recharge function and three dimensional fractured aquifer is not considered in the works of kovács et al 2005 and kovács and perrochet 2008 furthermore these two studies did not consider discharge variation of multiple springs the aim of this research is obtaining discharge variation of multiple springs associated with a three dimensional unconfined double porosity fractured aquifer with arbitrary areal recharge generally using analytical models to estimate discharge variations of springs may be better choices comparing to numerical ones as stated by hwang and lu 2007 numerical models are not time and cost efficient to estimate inflow to tunnels that are similar to discharge of springs from a groundwater hydraulic viewpoint the presented model better represents the fractured aquifer depleted by a spring than the boussinesq based model which neglects the vertical flow and the reservoir based models which consider a linear or non linear relationship between the average hydraulic head in the reservoir and its outflow thus neglect the horizontal flow for the single spring case furthermore the linear and non linear reservoir based models have several other issues that will be resolved in this study for instance linear and non linear reservoir based models cannot satisfactorily address some aspects of spring hydrograph like convex recession a peculiar increase in the slope of discharge time curve long time after the end of recharge schmidt et al 2014 their parameters e g recession coefficient do not have clear hydraulic and geometric interpretation for a real world aquifer they cannot simulate the effects of arbitrary areal recharge on discharge of springs they cannot be utilized to simulate discharge variations and dynamic reservoir volume of multiple springs the readers are referred to the following papers for details maillet 1905 coutagne 1948 mangin 1975 samani and ebrahimi 1996 these issues are addressed in this work the presented solution can be utilized to predict the discharge variation of multiple springs due to rainfall to calculate the dynamic reservoir volume of the springs to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer that is depleted by spring s as stated by hill and tiedeman 2006 hydraulic conductivity that is estimated utilizing flow data e g discharge variation of springs is more accurate comparing to that estimated using drawdown data collected during a pumping test furthermore estimation of the hydraulic parameters of aquifers using spring discharge data can be considered as a cost efficient and environmental friendly alternative to the method of pumping test where the spring discharge data exist 2 conceptual and mathematical models fig 1 is the schematic representation of the fractured unconfined rectangular aquifer with a spring the origin of the coordinate system is located at the base of the fractured unconfined aquifer at the left hand side of the aquifer as illustrated in fig 1 the z axis is positive upward the initial depth of the fractured unconfined aquifer is d and its horizontal extent along the x axis is l x and along y axis is l y the depth of the spring from the initial water table is z s an arbitrary areal recharge is imposed at the water table the double porosity approach barenblatt et al 1960 is adopted to simulate the fractured aquifer in this approach the aquifer domain consists of two interconnected overlapping continuums with different porosity and hydraulic conductivity moench 1984 one continuum is matrix block with low hydraulic conductivity and high porosity and the other continuum is fracture network with high hydraulic conductivity and low porosity the governing equations and boundary conditions are written for the fractured network continuum the matrix block continuum is served as an internal finite source sink of water utilization of this approach to simulate the flow in fractured aquifer is quite common moench 1984 park and zhan 2003 sedghi et al 2018 the use of the rectangular aquifer is based on the following considerations first in certain geological settings this type of aquifer has been reported to be associated with spring discharge for instance a conceptual model of a rectangular aquifer was considered by kovács et al 2005 for a karstic aquifer with an spring associated with it most of karstic spring in iran are associated with anticline reservoir ashjari and raeisi 2006 that can be treated as rectangular or strip shaped aquifers rectangular aquifers were also considered to calculate the aquifer recession flow before szilagyi et al 1998 as another example the ophiolite hard rock aquifer of the wadi khafifah sultanate of oman were simulated with a rectangular aquifer with no flow lateral boundaries dewandel et al 2003 second the simple rectangular shape makes the analytical approach amendable third the rectangular aquifer can be simplified to several other commonly studied aquifers for instance if both l x and l y are sufficiently large then the aquifer extends infinitely in the lateral directions which is the case investigated in most classical groundwater flow theories bear 1972 1979 this can be simulated by eliminating the image wells image springs from our model if l x is finite but l y is infinite then the aquifer becomes a strip type bounded by two parallel boundaries this type of aquifer is commonly seen in basin and range province of us in which a valley filled aquifer is bounded by two parallel mountains belcher et al 2017 fetter 2000 the strip aquifer is also seen when the aquifer is bounded by two parallel streams or canals batista et al 2012 nagheli et al 2020 sedghi and zhan 2019 fourth for an arbitrary shape of boundary numerical simulations should be used instead of the analytical approach here however as mentioned before up to present there is no study about the spring discharge in a double porosity fractured aquifer thus the numerical simulation results cannot be benchmarked against any analytical or semi analytical solutions which are not available without the benchmark it is impossible to access the numerical errors associated with the numerical simulation based on these considerations the analytical approach based on the rectangular aquifer is necessary and innovative for advancement of research on spring discharge in a double porosity fractured aquifer in this study the spring is treated as a constant drawdown variable flux point sink this can be done by obtaining constant flux point sink solution first the point sink solution is utilized to acquire the discharge variations of the spring later the three dimensional 3d governing equation of drawdown in the vicinity of a point sink source in the double porosity fractured unconfined aquifer is 1 k hf 2 s f x 2 k hf 2 s f y 2 k zf 2 s f z 2 γ s sf s f t q s t δ x x s δ y y s δ z z s where k hf and k zf are horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities of the fracture domain respectively lt 1 s f is drawdown in the fracture domain l s sf is specific storage of the fracture domain l 1 q s t is the rate of pumping for a point sink source l3t 1 that will be used to derive the drawdown for a spring later where sink is for pumping and source is for injection δ is dirac delta function x s y s z s is the point sink source location and t is time since start of pumping t γ is the inter porosity flux term between the fracture domain and the rock matrix defined as

the thickness of slab matrix blocks l z is the distance from the center of slab matrix blocks and the subscript m refers to the matrix blocks hereinafter all the symbols have been listed in notation the flow in the spherical matrix block is governed by the following partial differential equation deruyck et al 1982 3 k m r 2 r r 2 s m r s sm s m t where ssm is the specific storage of the rock matrix the inter porosity flux can also be calculated using a slab instead of spherical matrix block conceptual model the flow in the slab matrix block is governed by the following partial differential equation deruyck et al 1982 4 k m 2 s m z 2 s sm s m t the initial and boundary conditions for the matrix blocks are respectively 5 s m r 0 0 6 s m r m t s f for the spherical matrix blocks and 7 s m z 0 0 8 s m h m 2 t s f for the slab matrix blocks it should be noted that eq 1 is presented for the drawdown due to a time dependent point sink one can fix the drawdown in the vicinity of the point sink and solve the equation for time dependent sink q t which is done in this work eq 1 is solved subject to the following initial and boundary conditions the initial condition is 9 s x y z 0 0 the zero gradient or no flux boundary conditions are considered for the boundaries of rectangular aquifer domain as 10 s x x 0 0 11 s x x l x 0 12 s y y 0 0 13 s y y l y 0 the linearized free surface boundary condition for an instantaneously drainable water table is neuman 1974 sedghi and zhan 2020 14 k zf s f z z d s yf s f t z d r t where s yf is the specific yield of the fractures and r t is the arbitrary time varying areal recharge the no flow boundary condition at the bottom of the aquifer is 15 s f z z 0 0 3 point source sink solution dimensionless form of eq 1 with respect to dimensionless forms of the initial and boundary conditions of eqs 9 and 14 15 considering the laterally infinite extent aquifer can be solved in laplace domain following the same

series of ω n are obtained by solving the following equation using a root finding algorithm like newton raphson ω n sin ω n p σ cos ω n 0 and the following terms are related to the inter porosity flow deruyck et al 1982 19 γ sp 3 k m r md k hs 2 ω coth p ω r md 1 r md 20 γ sl 2 k m h md k hs 2 ω tanh p ω h md 2 it should be noted that eq 19 is obtained by solving the dimensionless form of eq 3 with respect to the initial and boundary condition of eqs 5 and 6 and inserting the result in the dimensionless form of eq 2 while eq 20 is obtained by solving the dimensionless form of eq 4 with respect to the initial and boundary condition of eqs 7 and 8 and inserting the result in dimensionless form of eq 2 deruyck et al 1982 sedghi and zhan 2021 to implement eqs 10 13 the image well method is considered chan 1976 this should be done in laplace domain as the point source is variable rate constant head e g spring murdoch and franco 1994 it should be noted that the image well and superposition in the time domain is usually used for the 2nd kind of source i e when the injection or pumping rate is prescribed not for the 1st kind of source i e when the head is prescribed this is due to the fact that the constant head boundary condition in the image well violates the assumption of the constant head boundary condition in the real well as the cone of depression of the image well expands over time and reaches to the real well murdoch and franco 1994 the image well method for prescribed head source however can be utilized in laplace domain murdoch and franco 1994 as the temporal changes are freeze there from the mathematical viewpoint as the unknown source function and impulse response are under the convolutional integral for the variable flux source in time domain the source function cannot be obtained unless its form is approximately assumed murdoch and franco 1994 in laplace domain however the convolutional integral is transformed into the multiplication of source function and impulse response thus the laplace domain source function can be obtained for a model of single or multiple variable flux sources the principle of superposition is also utilized to consider the arbitrary areal recharge see appendix a as 21 s fd q sd p 2 π n 1 cos ω n z d cos ω n z sd 0 25 0 5 sin 2 ω n ω n i 0 j 0 k 0 p ω n 2 γ sp x d x left d i 2 y d y down d j 2 k 0 p ω n 2 γ

sedghi and zhan 2020 with the term related to inter porosity flow γ sp or γ sl can be used as in the last right hand side term of eq 21 appendix b 4 discharge solution of the multiple springs setting

pressure there eq 26 can be solved for q sd p for the single spring case for multiple spring however eq 26 should be written for multiple springs and solved for their discharge following the same procedure as in sedghi and zhan 2020 the following matrix should be solved for the discharge of multiple springs 27 f s 1 1 f s 1 2 f s 1 n f s 2 1 f s 2 2 f s 2 n f sn 1 f sn 2 f sn n q s d 1 p q s d

m and s s d m is the constant drawdown in the spring m and it is calculated as 1 z sd to solve the system of linear equations in eq 27 the coefficient matrix left hand side matrix is calculated using eq 28 the first term of the right hand side matrix s s d m is calculated based on the depth of the m th spring from the initial water table as 1 z s d m the second term of the right hand side matrix is calculated based on the depth of the m th spring z s d m among other known parameters the only unknown of eq 27 is discharge of springs q s d 1 p q s d 2 p q s d 3 p q s d m p that can be obtained using backslash operator in matlab or matrix solution subroutine in fortran libraries it should be noted that for the case in which some of springs are dried the row of the matrix related to that springs should be removed from the matrix 5 results and discussion the laplace domain matrix of eq 27 is solved to calculate the time domain discharge of multi springs utilizing the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm it should be noted that the negative value of discharge is possible in solving the matrix of eq 27 when the drawdown of the aquifer becomes higher than that of the constant head point source when this occurs the spring s change to a constant head injection point which is certainly not reasonable from a practical viewpoint in practice the spring s becomes dry in this condition to implement this in our solution our program checks the value of the calculated spring discharge in each dimensionless time if it is less than zero the row belongs to that spring is eliminated from the matrix of eq 27 and the discharge is recalculated for that time the default parameter values given in table 2 are utilized to prepare figures these parameters correspond to fractured limestone singhal and gupta 2010 todd and mays 2005 it should be noted that the radius of the matrix blocks is 1 m that represent the jointed rock mass in section 5 1 results of the proposed model is compared to the solution presented by sedghi and zhan 2021 the recharge is eliminated from the solution i e r d p 0 in eq 27 as it is not considered in the solution of sedghi and zhan 2021 in sections 5 2 to 5 4 two cases are considered case 1 in which the second right hand side term of the matrix of eq 27 that represents the recharge is eliminated and the model shows the discharge of spring due to falling of water table from the initial location case 2 in which the first right hand side term of the matrix of eq 27 that represents the influences of the initial condition is eliminated and the model shows the discharge of spring due to the areal recharge the discharge of spring is sum of discharges of case 1 and case 2 these terms are separated to better discuss the hydraulic behavior of the aquifer depleted by spring s in section 5 5 eq 27 with all right hand side terms are utilized to calculate the spring depletion volume of the aquifer 5 1 comparison with sedghi and zhan 2021 in this section we compare our solution for single spring to a line source solution of sedghi and zhan 2021 fig 2 the tunnel is compared to the spring in this section as both of them are constant head variable discharge sinks however they are different in their length in fact springs are zero length tunnels thus it is expected that by decreasing the length of tunnel its discharge variations converge to that of spring we want to show this in fig 2 we eliminate the second right hand side term of matrix of eq 27 that represent the areal recharge thus the figure shows the discharge variation due to falling of water table from its initial position as shown in this figure decreasing the length of tunnel decreases its inflow and reduces its deviation from the discharge variation of the spring this occurs during the early and intermediate time during the late time however the discharge of spring significantly decreases due to the influences of the lateral no flow boundaries furthermore the temporal variation of inflow to the longer tunnel is more significant comparing to the shorter one as the longer tunnel deplete more water from the aquifer and posing more significant stress to the aquifer excluding the late time discharge data the discharge variation of spring is less than that of tunnels for the same reason in addition comparing tunnels and springs installed in single porosity black lines and double porosity blue lines aquifers reveals that the influences of the inter porosity flow on discharge of the tunnel is more marked comparing to the discharge of the spring reflecting the phenomenon that the inflow to tunnel is more sensitive to hydraulic parameters of matrix blocks 5 2 effects of the geometric parameters in this section the influences of the extent of the aquifer and location of the spring on its discharge variation are explored to test the influences of the aquifer extent on the discharge variation of the spring due to falling of water table from its initial position fig 3 is constructed different aquifer length along the x axis of 500 m 1000 m 1500 m and 2000 m are considered the figure reveals that during the late time decreasing the length of the aquifer reduces the discharge of the spring from the dimensional viewpoint the influence of the extent of aquifer on discharge variation of the spring starts at the time of about 46 29 days after the start of recession considering the default parameters values table 2 the slope of the dimensionless discharge dimensionless time curve significantly increases during the late time this is due to the expansion of the cone of the depression of the spring to the lateral no flow boundaries the increase of the slope of the recession curve during the late time long time after the end of the recharge period is also reported in some case studies bagheri et al 2016 kalantari and rouhi 2019 lauber et al 2014 nassery et al 2014 and is called convex recession schmidt et al 2014 modeled the convex recession considering a mature karstic aquifer with well developed conduit flow their model however is not applicable in other types of aquifers schmidt et al 2014 also only considered the case in which the convex recession occurs long after recharge period thus ruling out the influences of the conduit restricted flow in addition limited capacity overflow spring smart 1983 upgradient reservoir of water bonacci 1993 and flow regime transition bailly comte et al 2010 theorem which is equivalent to inter porosity flow in pumping test in fractured aquifers can explain the early and intermediate time convex recession but not the late time convex recession in fact the linear or nonlinear reservoir based models cannot simulate late time convex recession as they neglect the horizontal flow and therefore horizontal expansion of the cone of the depression of the spring other conditions also may cause convex recession which will be discussed in section 5 3 fig 4 shows the effects of the extent of the aquifer on the discharge of spring due to the areal recharge the constant areal recharge of 4 3 cm day starts at the dimensionless time of 10 and ends at the dimensionless time of 10 5 which correspond to 40 s and 4 6 days respectively the same aquifer length along the x axis l x as in fig 3 is considered inspecting the figure reveals that the aquifer length does not affect the peak of the discharge for dimensions of aquifer that are considered in this work that occurs at the dimensionless time of t d 10 5 at the dimensionless discharge of about 0 0055 that corresponds to 4 6 days and 0 55 lit s respectively this is the same for all springs as they capture the same amount of recharge after that starting from the dimensionless time of t d 10 6 46 29 days considering the default parameters values springs in aquifers with smaller l x have lower discharge as the lateral no flow boundaries start to limit the extent of the capture area of the spring this also increase the slope of dimensionless discharge dimensionless time curve during the late time the slope of the falling limb of discharge curve of the spring is by far less than the rising limb it takes very long time to diminish the influence of the recharge from the discharge variation of the spring this is reported in case studies on spring hydrograph recession curve before schmidt et al 2014 the effects of the location of the spring on its discharge variation due to falling of water table from its initial position is illustrated in fig 5 three spring locations of x s 10 y s 10 x s 10 y s 500 and x s 10 y s 1000 are considered as depicted in the figure the spring near the lower left hand corner in our case and near all corners in general has the lowest discharge during the intermediate and late time due to the effects of two no flow boundaries at the right angle on the expansion of the cone of the depression of the spring the effects of the location of the spring on its discharge variation due to recharge is shown in fig 6 as illustrated in the figure the springs near the corners of the aquifer have lower discharges due to areal recharge for the same reason as in fig 5 the maximum discharge is about 0 02 lit s considering the default parameters values table 2 and the definition of the dimensionless discharge table 1 5 3 interaction of multiple springs to demonstrate the influences of the discharge of multiple springs fig 7 is constructed four springs with the location given in the figure are considered each spring in the multiple spring aquifer is compared with the single spring aquifer to show how springs affect each other s discharge variations due to falling of water table from its initial position as depicted in the figure the upper springs have lower discharges due to the lower gradient toward them comparing the single and multiple spring cases reveals that the discharge is reduced for multiple spring cases during the intermediate and late time when the cones of the depression of different springs interfere with each other this also increases the slope of late time spring recession showing another reason for the late time convex recession generally interference of the cone of depression of the spring with another sink of water like another spring as in our case pumping well seepage face or outflow boundary cause the late time convex recession that may lead to drying of the spring neglecting this late time convex recession lead to overestimation of the spring drying time as is usually the case when the linear reservoir based models e g maillet 1905 are utilized dewandel et al 2003 furthermore comparing the hydrograph of deep spring z sd 0 5 for single and multiple springs cases show that two curves are re converged during the late time when the upper spring z sd 0 7 are dried with sharp slopes to show the effects of the areal recharge on discharge of multiple springs fig 8 is prepared the figure shows that increasing the depth of spring increases the discharge of spring due to the recharge this is due to the fact that the deeper springs capture more areal recharge the figure also shows that discharge of spring in a multiple spring system is lower than that of the single spring system as expected the interference of cone of the depression reduces the discharge of springs due to the areal recharge about 10 to 30 in our case 5 4 effects of hydraulic parameters of the matrix blocks to show the influences of the specific storage of the matrix block on the discharge variation of the springs due to falling of water table from its initial position fig 9 is constructed multiple springs are considered the figure shows that increasing the specific storage of the matrix blocks increases the early time discharge of springs as more water is provided by the matrix block and depleted by the spring this is more significant for the springs with greater depths from the initial water table as more matrix blocks are contributed to their discharge fig 9 also reveals that during the late time when the lateral no flow boundaries significantly reduce the discharge of springs discharge is increased by increasing the specific storage of the matrix blocks this is because the lateral no flow boundaries cannot provide water to springs when the cone of depression of the springs reaches the lateral boundaries thus more water is depleted from the matrix block instead the hydraulic conductivity and radius of matrix blocks do not significantly affect the discharge of springs and the figures of the influences of these parameters are not shown to illustrate the influences of the specific storage of the block matrix on the amount of increase of the discharge of the springs due to the recharge fig 10 is constructed this figure shows that increasing the specific storage of the matrix blocks decreases the discharge due to areal recharge this is because matrix block with a higher specific storage absorbs more water during the recharge period and this reduces the groundwater mound due to recharge as the spring is a constant head sink decreasing the groundwater mound decreases the hydraulic gradient toward it and therefore reduces the discharge of spring overall figs 9 and 10 show that the specific storage of the matrix blocks act as a buffer to the discharge of the springs it increases the discharge of springs due to falling of water table from its initial position and decreases the discharge of spring due to the areal recharge 5 5 spring depletion volume dynamic reservoir volume the following equation can be used to calculate the cumulative depletion volume of the spring 29 s d v t d 0 t d q s τ d τ where sdv is the cumulative spring depletion volume l3 the laplace domain counterpart of eq 29 is sedghi and zhan 2020 30 sdv p 1 p q s p k hf d 2 p q sd p the spring depletion volume as a function of time is calculated and depicted in fig 11 as shown in the figure increasing the elevation of the spring reduces the depletion volume as the discharge of spring is decreased by increasing its elevation furthermore the spring depletion volume curve becomes stabilized during the intermediate shallow springs or late time deep springs at the value that is an estimate of the dynamic reservoir volume of the spring as a matter of fact the dynamic reservoir volume spring depletion volume of a single spring in a finite aquifer with no flow lateral boundary is simply the volume of drainable water over the elevation of that spring however for multiple spring aquifer as in our case the dynamic volume of each spring should be calculated utilizing the presented model due to the interaction of the cone of depression of the springs 5 6 aquifer parameter estimation the presented model can be utilized to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer utilizing the discharge data of the spring s for single spring in a laterally extensive aquifer the temporal discharge variation due to falling of water table from its initial position is negligible fig 2 thus the discharge of spring is sum of constant base flow and discharge due to the rainfall that is obtained from eq 27 for single spring and neglection of the first right hand side term for multiple springs the initial condition should be considered i e all terms of eq 27 should be used because it will affect the discharge during the late time when the cone of depression of springs interfere or expand to lateral no flow boundaries figs 2 and 7 in these cases different starting time may be tested to match the pre rainfall simulated and observed spring discharge data it is recommended that the presented model coupled with a parameter estimation code to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer utilizing the discharge data of the spring s in this case one can estimate hydraulic parameters of the aquifer their sensitivity to discharge and their confidence interval furthermore one can set the recharge as an unknown parameter and estimate the effective recharge to the aquifer it should be noted that increasing the number of discharge observation increases the accuracy of the estimated parameters and reduces the chance of model non uniqueness the estimated parameters can be verified by comparing the discharge data collected during a different year with different rainfall to the simulated discharge using the estimated hydraulic parameters 6 limitations there are number of limitations associated with this work they are listed below 1 the aquifer is considered to be rectangular with a uniform thickness removing appropriate image wells change the aquifer to strip shaped or infinite extent other aquifer shapes cannot be modeled using the presented solution 2 the double porosity approach is considered to model the drawdown distribution in the aquifer by eliminating the inter porosity flow term however one can use the presented solution for single porosity aquifers 3 the hydraulic conductivity of matrix blocks is homogeneous and isotropic 4 the hydraulic conductivity of fracture network is homogeneous and anisotropic the method presented in this work cannot be extended to the case with zonation of hydraulic parameters as the constant head point should be selected near the spring the mentioned analytical approach suffers from gibbs phenomenon that should be handled mathematically where the gibbs phenomenon refers to instability of the infinite series arising from the fourier transform near its boundaries or jumps e g spring gottlieb and shu 1997 5 the darcian flow is considered in the fractured network thus the presented solution is not applicable to karstic aquifer with well developed secondary porosity and non darcian conduit flow 6 springs are the only outflow of the aquifer in the cases that are presented in this work the presented solution can be easily modified to simulate the seepage face evaluate the effects of pumping well s on spring s discharge to change the no flow lateral boundary s to constant head ones that simulate rivers 7 summary and conclusion the semi analytical solution of discharge variation of multi spring depleting a rectangular double porosity aquifer with an arbitrary areal recharge is presented the image well method in laplace space is utilized to obtain the solution the solution is obtained for a single spring system and then expanded to a multiple spring system the following results are drawn from the solution 1 decreasing the dimension of the aquifer reduces the late time discharge of the spring for the single spring case the dimension of the aquifer does not affect the peak of the discharge as all springs capture the same amount of recharge during the early time for the multiple spring case however the interference of the cone of depression reduces the peak of discharge provided that the springs are close enough 2 springs in aquifers with a smaller aquifer size have lower discharge as the lateral no flow boundaries start to limit the extent of the capture area of the spring springs near corners of the aquifer has the lower discharge during the intermediate and late time because of two no flow boundaries at the right angle on the expansion of the cone of the depression of the spring effects of areal recharge on the discharge of these springs are also less marked 3 interaction of multiple springs reduces the late time discharge of springs furthermore for a multiple spring aquifer the dynamic volume of each spring should be calculated utilizing the presented model due to the interaction of the cone of depression of the springs 4 the slope of the dimensionless discharge dimensionless time curve significantly increases during the late time which is named the convex recession and it is due to the expansion of the cone of depression of a spring to lateral no flow boundaries or interaction of multiple springs among other causes 5 the specific storage of the matrix blocks act as a buffer to the discharge of the springs it increases the discharge of springs due to falling of water table from its initial position and decreases the discharge of spring due to the areal recharge 6 the hydraulic conductivity and radius of matrix blocks do not significantly affect the discharge of springs 7 decreasing the depth of the spring from the initial water table reduces the depletion volume as the discharge of spring is decreased by decreasing its depth 8 the discharge data of spring can be used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer for single spring in a laterally extensive aquifer the temporal discharge variation due to falling of water table from its initial position is negligible thus the discharge of spring is sum of constant base flow and discharge due to the rainfall for multiple springs the initial condition should be considered because it will affect the discharge during the late time when the cone of depression of springs interfere or expand to lateral no flow boundaries subscript d represents the dimensionless parameter subscript k and m represent the location of constant head point of spring and spring itself respectively and overbar represents the laplace domain parameter these are used where appropriate credit authorship contribution statement mohammad m sedghi conceptualization methodology software writing original

3907,springs are important source of fresh water for many regions of the world most mathematical models simulating spring discharge are linear and non linear reservoir based models that are simple and easy to use they however suffer from oversimplification and a lack of physical processes that limit their applicability the goal of this work is to present process based analytical model of discharge variation of multiple springs associated with a rectangular fractured aquifer subjected to arbitrary recharge the solution is obtained via laplace and fourier transformations along with the superposition principle and image well method for a constant flux point sink then the constant head point sink solution representing a single spring is obtained from the constant flux point sink solution finally the constant head point sink solution is extended to simulate the multiple constant head sinks or springs utilizing the principle of superposition and matrix solution the solution considers the vertical anisotropy of fractures the inter porosity flow between fractures and matrix blocks and the instantaneous gravity drainage of the water table the results of this study are

basha 2020 to predict the spring discharge or to estimate the hydraulic and geometric parameters of the aquifers associated with springs an appropriate process based mathematical model and high quality data are needed the most well known model simulating the falling limb of spring hydrograph is the one presented by maillet 1905 although the linear reservoir model implying a linear relationship between the hydraulic head in the reservoir and its outflow was considered in developing this equation the key features of groundwater flow like darcy s law was neglected instead an empirical exponential function is considered to describe the falling limb where the discharge of spring is decreasing over time of the spring discharge by maillet 1905 the nonlinear power relationship between the storage and discharge was considered by coutagne 1948 mangin 1975 however proposed a hyperbolic function for the early time and exponential function for the late time recession of the spring discharge samani and ebrahimi 1996 added the flow rate or infiltration formula that was calculated utilizing the coutagne 1948 model to the mangin 1975 model to simulate the infiltration from the unsaturated or epikarst zone this makes their model more analytical in the sense that an infiltration equation is provided than that of mangin 1975 however samani and ebrahimi 1996 did not provide any further information on the aquifer than mangin 1975 furthermore the infiltration in the model of samani and ebrahimi 1996 never reaches zero so it has to be stopped artificially dewandel et al 2003 for more information on these models the reader may consult the following review papers basha 2020 fiorillo 2014 linear reservoirs of single and double porosity with single or multiple outlets were considered by hosseini and ataie ashtiani 2017 three parallel reservoirs of base flow intermediate flow and quick flow have been considered by hosseini et al 2017 to simulate the springe discharge all above mentioned works neglected the horizontal flow in the reservoir s thus these models are unable to accurately estimate the aquifer parameters especially when the horizontal component of flow is significant dewandel et al 2003 furthermore the reservoir based models e g maillet 1905 underestimates the dynamic volume of the aquifer storage dewandel et al 2003 which is the volume of drainable water over the elevation of a spring of concern the physically based recession flow solutions may be used to simulate the falling limb of the spring hydrograph and simple geometric and hydraulic characteristics of the aquifer were assumed in most of these models basha 2020 approximate solution of the groundwater flow equation boussinesq 1877 and nonlinear groundwater flow equation boussinesq 1904 were utilized to obtain aquifer recession flow instead of using temporal variation of discharge brutsaert and nieber 1977 suggested to utilize derivative of discharge with respect to time versus discharge curve they presented expressions for discharge derivative and discharge according to single reservoir and boussinesq s models they showed that single reservoir model is inadequate to describe the full range of recession flow using drought flow of six river basins this method was extended by troch et al 1993 to estimate hydraulic conductivity and depth to impervious layer using the base flow data they considered a rectangular homogeneous unconfined aquifer under the dupuit assumptions utilizing the method that is presented by troch et al 1993 one can estimate the horizontal hydraulic conductivity and the average saturated thickness of the aquifer the method of troch et al 1993 was examined by szilagyi et al 1998 using a synthetic recession flow data generated by a numerical model they considered an aquifer with complex geometry gently sloping impervious layer and spatially variable hydraulic conductivity their work indicated that increasing the complexity of the aquifer did not affect the estimation of hydraulic conductivity and mean saturated thickness of the aquifer using the method suggested by troch et al 1993 hogarth et al 2014 extended the discharge derivative versus discharge curve for sloping aquifers to model the sloping aquifer they presented an approximation of the boussinesq s equation they explored the influences of the aquifer slope on the time derivative of the discharge the method suggested by brutsaert and nieber 1977 however was not applicable to significantly heterogenous aquifers rupp and selker 2006 biswal and nagesh kumar 2014 showed that degree of recharge and spatial variation of the rainfall cause deviation from recession flow suggested by brutsaert and nieber 1977 they showed that the amount of recharge and the recharge distribution affected the time derivate of discharge with a different manner a careful examination shows that the above mentioned works only concerned single porosity aquifers while double porosity fractured aquifer has never been considered the double porosity fractured aquifer considers two co existing continuums of fractures and rock matrix and the fracture continuum has a high permeability but low specific storage while the rock matrix continuum has a low permeability but high specific storage furthermore flow between rock matrix blocks is prohibited but flow between rock matrix blocks and fractures is permitted this is different from the double permeability fractured aquifer model in which flow between rock matrix blocks as well as flow between rock matrix blocks and fractures are both permitted kovács et al 2005 used a heat conduction model that is analogue to groundwater flow along with conduit flow to simulate the discharge of spring in karstic aquifers constant rate recharge was considered by kovács and perrochet 2008 the variable rate arbitrary recharge function and three dimensional fractured aquifer is not considered in the works of kovács et al 2005 and kovács and perrochet 2008 furthermore these two studies did not consider discharge variation of multiple springs the aim of this research is obtaining discharge variation of multiple springs associated with a three dimensional unconfined double porosity fractured aquifer with arbitrary areal recharge generally using analytical models to estimate discharge variations of springs may be better choices comparing to numerical ones as stated by hwang and lu 2007 numerical models are not time and cost efficient to estimate inflow to tunnels that are similar to discharge of springs from a groundwater hydraulic viewpoint the presented model better represents the fractured aquifer depleted by a spring than the boussinesq based model which neglects the vertical flow and the reservoir based models which consider a linear or non linear relationship between the average hydraulic head in the reservoir and its outflow thus neglect the horizontal flow for the single spring case furthermore the linear and non linear reservoir based models have several other issues that will be resolved in this study for instance linear and non linear reservoir based models cannot satisfactorily address some aspects of spring hydrograph like convex recession a peculiar increase in the slope of discharge time curve long time after the end of recharge schmidt et al 2014 their parameters e g recession coefficient do not have clear hydraulic and geometric interpretation for a real world aquifer they cannot simulate the effects of arbitrary areal recharge on discharge of springs they cannot be utilized to simulate discharge variations and dynamic reservoir volume of multiple springs the readers are referred to the following papers for details maillet 1905 coutagne 1948 mangin 1975 samani and ebrahimi 1996 these issues are addressed in this work the presented solution can be utilized to predict the discharge variation of multiple springs due to rainfall to calculate the dynamic reservoir volume of the springs to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer that is depleted by spring s as stated by hill and tiedeman 2006 hydraulic conductivity that is estimated utilizing flow data e g discharge variation of springs is more accurate comparing to that estimated using drawdown data collected during a pumping test furthermore estimation of the hydraulic parameters of aquifers using spring discharge data can be considered as a cost efficient and environmental friendly alternative to the method of pumping test where the spring discharge data exist 2 conceptual and mathematical models fig 1 is the schematic representation of the fractured unconfined rectangular aquifer with a spring the origin of the coordinate system is located at the base of the fractured unconfined aquifer at the left hand side of the aquifer as illustrated in fig 1 the z axis is positive upward the initial depth of the fractured unconfined aquifer is d and its horizontal extent along the x axis is l x and along y axis is l y the depth of the spring from the initial water table is z s an arbitrary areal recharge is imposed at the water table the double porosity approach barenblatt et al 1960 is adopted to simulate the fractured aquifer in this approach the aquifer domain consists of two interconnected overlapping continuums with different porosity and hydraulic conductivity moench 1984 one continuum is matrix block with low hydraulic conductivity and high porosity and the other continuum is fracture network with high hydraulic conductivity and low porosity the governing equations and boundary conditions are written for the fractured network continuum the matrix block continuum is served as an internal finite source sink of water utilization of this approach to simulate the flow in fractured aquifer is quite common moench 1984 park and zhan 2003 sedghi et al 2018 the use of the rectangular aquifer is based on the following considerations first in certain geological settings this type of aquifer has been reported to be associated with spring discharge for instance a conceptual model of a rectangular aquifer was considered by kovács et al 2005 for a karstic aquifer with an spring associated with it most of karstic spring in iran are associated with anticline reservoir ashjari and raeisi 2006 that can be treated as rectangular or strip shaped aquifers rectangular aquifers were also considered to calculate the aquifer recession flow before szilagyi et al 1998 as another example the ophiolite hard rock aquifer of the wadi khafifah sultanate of oman were simulated with a rectangular aquifer with no flow lateral boundaries dewandel et al 2003 second the simple rectangular shape makes the analytical approach amendable third the rectangular aquifer can be simplified to several other commonly studied aquifers for instance if both l x and l y are sufficiently large then the aquifer extends infinitely in the lateral directions which is the case investigated in most classical groundwater flow theories bear 1972 1979 this can be simulated by eliminating the image wells image springs from our model if l x is finite but l y is infinite then the aquifer becomes a strip type bounded by two parallel boundaries this type of aquifer is commonly seen in basin and range province of us in which a valley filled aquifer is bounded by two parallel mountains belcher et al 2017 fetter 2000 the strip aquifer is also seen when the aquifer is bounded by two parallel streams or canals batista et al 2012 nagheli et al 2020 sedghi and zhan 2019 fourth for an arbitrary shape of boundary numerical simulations should be used instead of the analytical approach here however as mentioned before up to present there is no study about the spring discharge in a double porosity fractured aquifer thus the numerical simulation results cannot be benchmarked against any analytical or semi analytical solutions which are not available without the benchmark it is impossible to access the numerical errors associated with the numerical simulation based on these considerations the analytical approach based on the rectangular aquifer is necessary and innovative for advancement of research on spring discharge in a double porosity fractured aquifer in this study the spring is treated as a constant drawdown variable flux point sink this can be done by obtaining constant flux point sink solution first the point sink solution is utilized to acquire the discharge variations of the spring later the three dimensional 3d governing equation of drawdown in the vicinity of a point sink source in the double porosity fractured unconfined aquifer is 1 k hf 2 s f x 2 k hf 2 s f y 2 k zf 2 s f z 2 γ s sf s f t q s t δ x x s δ

considered chan 1976 this should be done in laplace domain as the point source is variable rate constant head e g spring murdoch and franco 1994 it should be noted that the image well and superposition in the time domain is usually used for the 2nd kind of source i e when the injection or pumping rate is prescribed not for the 1st kind of source i e when the head is prescribed this is due to the fact that the constant head boundary condition in the image well violates the assumption of the constant head boundary condition in the real well as the cone of depression of the image well expands over time and reaches to the real well murdoch and franco 1994 the image well method for prescribed head source however can be utilized in laplace domain murdoch and franco 1994 as the temporal changes are freeze there from the mathematical viewpoint as the unknown source function and impulse response are under the convolutional integral for the variable flux source in time domain the source function cannot be obtained unless its form is approximately assumed murdoch and franco 1994 in laplace domain however the convolutional integral is transformed into the multiplication of source function and impulse response thus the laplace domain source function can be obtained for a model of single or multiple variable flux sources the principle of superposition is also utilized to consider the arbitrary areal recharge see appendix a as 21 s fd q sd p 2 π n 1 cos ω n z d cos ω n z sd 0 25 0 5 sin 2 ω n ω n i 0 j 0 k 0 p ω n 2 γ sp x d x left d i 2 y d y down d j 2 k 0 p ω n 2 γ

sedghi and zhan 2020 with the term related to inter porosity flow γ sp or γ sl can be used as in the last right hand side term of eq 21 appendix b 4 discharge solution of the multiple springs setting

pressure there eq 26 can be solved for q sd p for the single spring case for multiple spring however eq 26 should be written for multiple springs and solved for their discharge following the same procedure as in sedghi and zhan 2020 the following matrix should be solved for the discharge of multiple springs 27 f s 1 1 f s 1 2 f s 1 n f s 2 1 f s 2 2 f s 2 n f sn 1 f sn 2 f sn n q s d 1 p q s d

using backslash operator in matlab or matrix solution subroutine in fortran libraries it should be noted that for the case in which some of springs are dried the row of the matrix related to that springs should be removed from the matrix 5 results and discussion the laplace domain matrix of eq 27 is solved to calculate the time domain discharge of multi springs utilizing the de hoog et al 1982 algorithm it should be noted that the negative value of discharge is possible in solving the matrix of eq 27 when the drawdown of the aquifer becomes higher than that of the constant head point source when this occurs the spring s change to a constant head injection point which is certainly not reasonable from a practical viewpoint in practice the spring s becomes dry in this condition to implement this in our solution our program checks the value of the calculated spring discharge in each dimensionless time if it is less than zero the row belongs to that spring is eliminated from the matrix of eq 27 and the discharge is recalculated for that time the default parameter values given in table 2 are utilized to prepare figures these parameters correspond to fractured limestone singhal and gupta 2010 todd and mays 2005 it should be noted that the radius of the matrix blocks is 1 m that represent the jointed rock mass in section 5 1 results of the proposed model is compared to the solution presented by sedghi and zhan 2021 the recharge is eliminated from the solution i e r d p 0 in eq 27 as it is not considered in the solution of sedghi and zhan 2021 in sections 5 2 to 5 4 two cases are considered case 1 in which the second right hand side term of the matrix of eq 27 that represents the recharge is eliminated and the model shows the discharge of spring due to falling of water table from the initial location case 2 in which the first right hand side term of the matrix of eq 27 that represents the influences of the initial condition is eliminated and the model shows the discharge of spring due to the areal recharge the discharge of spring is sum of discharges of case 1 and case 2 these terms are separated to better discuss the hydraulic behavior of the aquifer depleted by spring s in section 5 5 eq 27 with all right hand side terms are utilized to calculate the spring depletion volume of the aquifer 5 1 comparison with sedghi and zhan 2021 in this section we compare our solution for single spring to a line source solution of sedghi and zhan 2021 fig 2 the tunnel is compared to the spring in this section as both of them are constant head variable discharge sinks however they are different in their length in fact springs are zero length tunnels thus it is expected that by decreasing the length of tunnel its discharge variations converge to that of spring we want to show this in fig 2 we eliminate the second right hand side term of matrix of eq 27 that represent the areal recharge thus the figure shows the discharge variation due to falling of water table from its initial position as shown in this figure decreasing the length of tunnel decreases its inflow and reduces its deviation from the discharge variation of the spring this occurs during the early and intermediate time during the late time however the discharge of spring significantly decreases due to the influences of the lateral no flow boundaries furthermore the temporal variation of inflow to the longer tunnel is more significant comparing to the shorter one as the longer tunnel deplete more water from the aquifer and posing more significant stress to the aquifer excluding the late time discharge data the discharge variation of spring is less than that of tunnels for the same reason in addition comparing tunnels and springs installed in single porosity black lines and double porosity blue lines aquifers reveals that the influences of the inter porosity flow on discharge of the tunnel is more marked comparing to the discharge of the spring reflecting the phenomenon that the inflow to tunnel is more sensitive to hydraulic parameters of matrix blocks 5 2 effects of the geometric parameters in this section the influences of the extent of the aquifer and location of the spring on its discharge variation are explored to test the influences of the aquifer extent on the discharge variation of the spring due to falling of water table from its initial position fig 3 is constructed different aquifer length along the x axis of 500 m 1000 m 1500 m and 2000 m are considered the figure reveals that during the late time decreasing the length of the aquifer reduces the discharge of the spring from the dimensional viewpoint the influence of the extent of aquifer on discharge variation of the spring starts at the time of about 46 29 days after the start of recession considering the default parameters values table 2 the slope of the dimensionless discharge dimensionless time curve significantly increases during the late time this is due to the expansion of the cone of the depression of the spring to the lateral no flow boundaries the increase of the slope of the recession curve during the late time long time after the end of the recharge period is also reported in some case studies bagheri et al 2016 kalantari and rouhi 2019 lauber et al 2014 nassery et al 2014 and is called convex recession schmidt et al 2014 modeled the convex recession considering a mature karstic aquifer with well developed conduit flow their model however is not applicable in other types of aquifers schmidt et al 2014 also only considered the case in which the convex recession occurs long after recharge period thus ruling out the influences of the conduit restricted flow in addition limited capacity overflow spring smart 1983 upgradient reservoir of water bonacci 1993 and flow regime transition bailly comte et al 2010 theorem which is equivalent to inter porosity flow in pumping test in fractured aquifers can explain the early and intermediate time convex recession but not the late time convex recession in fact the linear or nonlinear reservoir based models cannot simulate late time convex recession as they neglect the horizontal flow and therefore horizontal expansion of the cone of the depression of the spring other conditions also may cause convex recession which will be discussed in section 5 3 fig 4 shows the effects of the extent of the aquifer on the discharge of spring due to the areal recharge the constant areal recharge of 4 3 cm day starts at the dimensionless time of 10 and ends at the dimensionless time of 10 5 which correspond to 40 s and 4 6 days respectively the same aquifer length along the x axis l x as in fig 3 is considered inspecting the figure reveals that the aquifer length does not affect the peak of the discharge for dimensions of aquifer that are considered in this work that occurs at the dimensionless time of t d 10 5 at the dimensionless discharge of about 0 0055 that corresponds to 4 6 days and 0 55 lit s respectively this is the same for all springs as they capture the same amount of recharge after that starting from the dimensionless time of t d 10 6 46 29 days considering the default parameters values springs in aquifers with smaller l x have lower discharge as the lateral no flow boundaries start to limit the extent of the capture area of the spring this also increase the slope of dimensionless discharge dimensionless time curve during the late time the slope of the falling limb of discharge curve of the spring is by far less than the rising limb it takes very long time to diminish the influence of the recharge from the discharge variation of the spring this is reported in case studies on spring hydrograph recession curve before schmidt et al 2014 the effects of the location of the spring on its discharge variation due to falling of water table from its initial position is illustrated in fig 5 three spring locations of x s 10 y s 10 x s 10 y s 500 and x s 10 y s 1000 are considered as depicted in the figure the spring near the lower left hand corner in our case and near all corners in general has the lowest discharge during the intermediate and late time due to the effects of two no flow boundaries at the right angle on the expansion of the cone of the depression of the spring the effects of the location of the spring on its discharge variation due to recharge is shown in fig 6 as illustrated in the figure the springs near the corners of the aquifer have lower discharges due to areal recharge for the same reason as in fig 5 the maximum discharge is about 0 02 lit s considering the default parameters values table 2 and the definition of the dimensionless discharge table 1 5 3 interaction of multiple springs to demonstrate the influences of the discharge of multiple springs fig 7 is constructed four springs with the location given in the figure are considered each spring in the multiple spring aquifer is compared with the single spring aquifer to show how springs affect each other s discharge variations due to falling of water table from its initial position as depicted in the figure the upper springs have lower discharges due to the lower gradient toward them comparing the single and multiple spring cases reveals that the discharge is reduced for multiple spring cases during the intermediate and late time when the cones of the depression of different springs interfere with each other this also increases the slope of late time spring recession showing another reason for the late time convex recession generally interference of the cone of depression of the spring with another sink of water like another spring as in our case pumping well seepage face or outflow boundary cause the late time convex recession that may lead to drying of the spring neglecting this late time convex recession lead to overestimation of the spring drying time as is usually the case when the linear reservoir based models e g maillet 1905 are utilized dewandel et al 2003 furthermore comparing the hydrograph of deep spring z sd 0 5 for single and multiple springs cases show that two curves are re converged during the late time when the upper spring z sd 0 7 are dried with sharp slopes to show the effects of the areal recharge on discharge of multiple springs fig 8 is prepared the figure shows that increasing the depth of spring increases the discharge of spring due to the recharge this is due to the fact that the deeper springs capture more areal recharge the figure also shows that discharge of spring in a multiple spring system is lower than that of the single spring system as expected the interference of cone of the depression reduces the discharge of springs due to the areal recharge about 10 to 30 in our case 5 4 effects of hydraulic parameters of the matrix blocks to show the influences of the specific storage of the matrix block on the discharge variation of the springs due to falling of water table from its initial position fig 9 is constructed multiple springs are considered the figure shows that increasing the specific storage of the matrix blocks increases the early time discharge of springs as more water is provided by the matrix block and depleted by the spring this is more significant for the springs with greater depths from the initial water table as more matrix blocks are contributed to their discharge fig 9 also reveals that during the late time when the lateral no flow boundaries significantly reduce the discharge of springs discharge is increased by increasing the specific storage of the matrix blocks this is because the lateral no flow boundaries cannot provide water to springs when the cone of depression of the springs reaches the lateral boundaries thus more water is depleted from the matrix block instead the hydraulic conductivity and radius of matrix blocks do not significantly affect the discharge of springs and the figures of the influences of these parameters are not shown to illustrate the influences of the specific storage of the block matrix on the amount of increase of the discharge of the springs due to the recharge fig 10 is constructed this figure shows that increasing the specific storage of the matrix blocks decreases the discharge due to areal recharge this is because matrix block with a higher specific storage absorbs more water during the recharge period and this reduces the groundwater mound due to recharge as the spring is a constant head sink decreasing the groundwater mound decreases the hydraulic gradient toward it and therefore reduces the discharge of spring overall figs 9 and 10 show that the specific storage of the matrix blocks act as a buffer to the discharge of the springs it increases the discharge of springs due to falling of water table from its initial position and decreases the discharge of spring due to the areal recharge 5 5 spring depletion volume dynamic reservoir volume the following equation can be used to calculate the cumulative depletion volume of the spring 29 s d v t d 0 t d q s τ d τ where sdv is the cumulative spring depletion volume l3 the laplace domain counterpart of eq 29 is sedghi and zhan 2020 30 sdv p 1 p q s p k hf d 2 p q sd p the spring depletion volume as a function of time is calculated and depicted in fig 11 as shown in the figure increasing the elevation of the spring reduces the depletion volume as the discharge of spring is decreased by increasing its elevation furthermore the spring depletion volume curve becomes stabilized during the intermediate shallow springs or late time deep springs at the value that is an estimate of the dynamic reservoir volume of the spring as a matter of fact the dynamic reservoir volume spring depletion volume of a single spring in a finite aquifer with no flow lateral boundary is simply the volume of drainable water over the elevation of that spring however for multiple spring aquifer as in our case the dynamic volume of each spring should be calculated utilizing the presented model due to the interaction of the cone of depression of the springs 5 6 aquifer parameter estimation the presented model can be utilized to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the fractured aquifer utilizing the discharge data of the spring s for single spring in a laterally extensive aquifer the temporal discharge variation due to falling of water table from its initial position is negligible fig 2 thus the discharge of spring is sum of constant base flow and discharge due to the rainfall that is obtained from eq 27 for single spring and neglection of the first right hand side term for multiple springs the initial condition should be considered i e all terms of eq 27 should be used because it will affect the discharge during the late time when the cone of depression of springs interfere or expand to lateral no flow boundaries figs 2 and 7 in these cases different starting time may be tested to match the pre rainfall simulated and observed spring discharge data it is recommended that the presented model coupled with a parameter estimation code to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer utilizing the discharge data of the spring s in this case one can estimate hydraulic parameters of the aquifer their sensitivity to discharge and their confidence interval furthermore one can set the recharge as an unknown parameter and estimate the effective recharge to the aquifer it should be noted that increasing the number of discharge observation increases the accuracy of the estimated parameters and reduces the chance of model non uniqueness the estimated parameters can be verified by comparing the discharge data collected during a different year with different rainfall to the simulated discharge using the estimated hydraulic parameters 6 limitations there are number of limitations associated with this work they are listed below 1 the aquifer is considered to be rectangular with a uniform thickness removing appropriate image wells change the aquifer to strip shaped or infinite extent other aquifer shapes cannot be modeled using the presented solution 2 the double porosity approach is considered to model the drawdown distribution in the aquifer by eliminating the inter porosity flow term however one can use the presented solution for single porosity aquifers 3 the hydraulic conductivity of matrix blocks is homogeneous and isotropic 4 the hydraulic conductivity of fracture network is homogeneous and anisotropic the method presented in this work cannot be extended to the case with zonation of hydraulic parameters as the constant head point should be selected near the spring the mentioned analytical approach suffers from gibbs phenomenon that should be handled mathematically where the gibbs phenomenon refers to instability of the infinite series arising from the fourier transform near its boundaries or jumps e g spring gottlieb and shu 1997 5 the darcian flow is considered in the fractured network thus the presented solution is not applicable to karstic aquifer with well developed secondary porosity and non darcian conduit flow 6 springs are the only outflow of the aquifer in the cases that are presented in this work the presented solution can be easily modified to simulate the seepage face evaluate the effects of pumping well s on spring s discharge to change the no flow lateral boundary s to constant head ones that simulate rivers 7 summary and conclusion the semi analytical solution of discharge variation of multi spring depleting a rectangular double porosity aquifer with an arbitrary areal recharge is presented the image well method in laplace space is utilized to obtain the solution the solution is obtained for a single spring system and then expanded to a multiple spring system the following results are drawn from the solution 1 decreasing the dimension of the aquifer reduces the late time discharge of the spring for the single spring case the dimension of the aquifer does not affect the peak of the discharge as all springs capture the same amount of recharge during the early time for the multiple spring case however the interference of the cone of depression reduces the peak of discharge provided that the springs are close enough 2 springs in aquifers with a smaller aquifer size have lower discharge as the lateral no flow boundaries start to limit the extent of the capture area of the spring springs near corners of the aquifer has the lower discharge during the intermediate and late time because of two no flow boundaries at the right angle on the expansion of the cone of the depression of the spring effects of areal recharge on the discharge of these springs are also less marked 3 interaction of multiple springs reduces the late time discharge of springs furthermore for a multiple spring aquifer the dynamic volume of each spring should be calculated utilizing the presented model due to the interaction of the cone of depression of the springs 4 the slope of the dimensionless discharge dimensionless time curve significantly increases during the late time which is named the convex recession and it is due to the expansion of the cone of depression of a spring to lateral no flow boundaries or interaction of multiple springs among other causes 5 the specific storage of the matrix blocks act as a buffer to the discharge of the springs it increases the discharge of springs due to falling of water table from its initial position and decreases the discharge of spring due to the areal recharge 6 the hydraulic conductivity and radius of matrix blocks do not significantly affect the discharge of springs 7 decreasing the depth of the spring from the initial water table reduces the depletion volume as the discharge of spring is decreased by decreasing its depth 8 the discharge data of spring can be used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer for single spring in a laterally extensive aquifer the temporal discharge variation due to falling of water table from its initial position is negligible thus the discharge of spring is sum of constant base flow and discharge due to the rainfall for multiple springs the initial condition should be considered because it will affect the discharge during the late time when the cone of depression of springs interfere or expand to lateral no flow boundaries subscript d represents the dimensionless parameter subscript k and m represent the location of constant head point of spring and spring itself respectively and overbar represents the laplace domain parameter these are used where appropriate credit authorship contribution statement mohammad m sedghi conceptualization methodology software writing original

3908,water sensitive urban design is an integral part of flood risk management based on computational modelling we investigated the influence of various urban forms on flooding severity at the level of an urban block and for the case of long duration urban flooding the upstream flow depths downstream discharge partition and flow exchange through the urban forms were examined the results indicate that one urban characteristic has an overwhelming influence on the flow variables the conveyance porosity in the main flow direction is by far more influential than the conveyance porosity in the normal direction or the number of streets such anisotropic effect was not pointed in recent similar studies and it hints at practical guidelines for sustainable urban planning in practice moreover the computational model was verified against laboratory observations which constitute a novel valuable dataset for the validation of other urban flooding models keywords urban flooding urban forms flood

et al 2019 the impacts of urban flooding are rising as a result of rapid urbanization and more frequent extreme rainfall events chen et al 2015 muis et al 2015 yin et al 2015 this trend puts urban flood risk modelling and management as a global priority guo et al 2020 nkwunonwo et al 2020 rosenzweig et al 2021 experience has shown that effectively mitigating urban flood risk is only possible if the scope of urban flood risk management is extended well beyond traditional approaches such as upgrade of flood defenses and urban drainage systems la loggia et al 2020 rosenberger et al 2021 among other aspects concepts such as water sensitive urban planning or sponge cities are increasingly considered as an integral part of urban flood risk management qin 2020 yin et al 2021 löwe et al 2017 suggest that flood resilient urban planning may be economically more efficient than upgrading the drainage system in a context of uncertain future climate similarly based on multiple urbanization scenarios at the regional level mustafa et al 2018 pointed out that future flood risk will be strongly influenced by spatial planning policies the arrangement of buildings is a major component of urban planning the resulting urban forms affect not only flood vulnerability but also flood hazard indeed the layout of buildings in floodplains alters the flow paths leandro et al 2016 so that flood hazard is changed both in magnitude and in terms of spatial distribution upstream depths and downstream discharges lin et al 2020 showcased the importance of geometric parameters characterizing the arrangement of buildings on pluvial flooding hotspots in a real world urban district shenzhen china hence the influence of urban forms on flooding is an important aspect of flood resilient urban design yin et al 2021 1 2 existing experimental and numerical studies on urban forms urban flooding was extensively studied over the last few years teng et al 2017 mignot et al 2019 tesema and abebe 2020 but the influence of urban forms on flooding has received relatively little attention table 1 lists existing computational and experimental studies dedicated to the impacts of variations in the arrangement of buildings on flow patterns as detailed below the most widely investigated parameters include building density cea et al 2010 huang et al 2014 guillén et al 2017 dong et al 2021 street or building orientation herbich and shulits 1964 soares frazão and zech 2008 velickovic et al 2017 street width tomiczek et al 2016 velickovic et al 2017 and building positioning aligned vs staggered testa et al 2007 cea et al 2010 goseberg 2013 isidoro et al 2013 based on an outdoor scale model of a river valley in which a dam break induced flood wave was simulated testa et al 2007 performed pointwise measurements of flow depth evolution for two distinct building arrangements aligned and staggered buildings in a laboratory setup operated with steady inflow velickovic et al 2017 investigated the distribution of flow depths for five arrangements of buildings which differed by the orientation of the streets with respect to the direction of approaching flow and by the street widths huang et al 2014 measured flow depths in a series of laboratory experiments involving building arrangements characterized by seven different building coverage ratios in these three studies no other flow variable than flow depth was analyzed tomiczek et al 2016 investigated the influence of the spacing between buildings on turbulence and hydrodynamic loads on buildings during a tsunami wave submersion recently laboratory observations by dong et al 2021 suggested a lower influence of the building arrangement compared to the effect of urban drainage in the case of a dam break wave however the setup was limited to a single street and only two values of building density were tested two experimental studies investigated the influence of building arrangements on pluvial flooding cea et al 2010 tested eight different building arrangements and measured the runoff hydrograph at the outlet of the urban area their analysis focused on the validation of two computational models isidoro et al 2013 considered a fixed building density but they varied the rooftop connectivity a substantial influence on runoff hydrographs was observed with reductions in peak discharges of the runoff hydrograph when the building rooftops are more clustered overall in all previous experimental studies the velocity fields and discharge partitions within the built area were not comprehensively investigated moreover the number of tested configurations remained generally limited which restrains the possibility of reaching conclusive results of broad interest particularly no experimental study so far performed a systematic analysis of relatively complex urban forms involving street intersections of several types a limited number of studies used computational modelling to bring insights into the influence of urban forms on flooding for a case study in melbourne australia löwe et al 2017 estimated future flood risk under various scenarios of urban development and rain intensities they highlighted that water sensitive urban design appears as effective as other flood adaption strategies e g rainwater harvesting tanks or increase of the pipe network capacity for reducing flood hazard however the so called water sensitive urban design of löwe et al 2017 shows essentially a lower building coverage i e more multi storey apartment buildings while subtler effects of urban forms on flooding mechanisms were not investigated based on computations involving 2 000 synthetic arrangements of buildings bruwier et al 2018 analyzed the sensitivity of flow depths with respect to nine urban geometric parameters typical street length width and curvature building coverage etc for the case of river flooding their main findings suggest i a dominating influence of the district level conveyance porosity ratio of voids in a cross sectional area over the whole area and ii that more fragmented urban forms i e larger and more numerous spaces in between buildings tend to reduce flooding severity based on the outcomes of bruwier et al 2018 mustafa et al 2020 demonstrated a procedure for the automatic design of flood sensitive urban layouts by combining an optimization algorithm an efficient hydraulic model and procedural modelling for the parameterized generation of urban layouts bruwier et al 2020 extended the analysis to the case of pluvial flooding showing that in this particular case urban density building coverage is a suitable explanatory variable for predicting the influence of building arrangement on flow depth water storage and runoff hydrograph these computational studies showcase the substantial influence of urban characteristics on flow variables during urban flooding but they involve specific flow patterns in complex urban layouts for which neither field nor laboratory validation data exist moreover comprehensive research involving thousands of urban forms bruwier et al 2018 2020 allowed deriving statistical regressions between urban parameters and flood danger but the flow patterns were too complex to enable direct physical interpretation and a sound understanding of the flow processes at stake therefore we aim here at conducting a more in depth systematic analysis of a limited number of geometric parameters under more controlled flow conditions i e simpler settings 1 3 objective in the present research we combine computational modelling and laboratory experiments to study the influence of urban forms on flow characteristics over a building block i e the area encompassed between four intersecting streets the experimental tests allow detailed validation of the computational model based on a restricted number of representative urban configurations while the computations enable a more systematic assessment of the influence of urban forms on flow processes a series of nineteen urban forms were considered they were generated by varying the arrangement of buildings as well as the number and width of minor streets inside a building block these variations either lead to a change in the conveyance porosity of the building block or to a change in the number of minor streets with the aim of disentangling the relative importance of the different effects we performed two dimensional numerical simulations for all considered urban forms and typical river flooding conditions the results obtained for five out of nineteen urban forms were verified in dedicated laboratory experiments the laboratory dataset includes pointwise flow depth measurements upstream of the urban block discharge partition at the street outlets as well as surface flow velocity measured by large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv section 2 describes the overall methodology while the validation of the computational model is detailed in section 3 the numerical results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5 and conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 data and methods our overall methodology consists of four steps i define urban forms ii for a limited number of them verify the numerical model by comparing against experimental data iii perform systematic numerical simulations to assess the influence of urban forms on the flow variables iv conclude on the influence of urban forms on flow variables the considered urban forms are introduced in section 2 1 and the flooding scenario in section 2 2 together with the examined flow variables the numerical model is briefly presented in section 2 3 while section 2 4 provides a description of the laboratory experiments 2 1 urban forms to assess the influence of urban forms on flow characteristics we considered a part of a synthetic urban district as shown in fig 1 it involves two main streets along one direction and two main streets in the normal direction forming four crossroads with three or four branches the width of the main streets is noted b and was kept constant various urban forms were defined inside the central rectangular area surrounded by the four main streets the size of this area is ly 6 4 b along direction x and lx 2 4 b along direction y these values are plausible and they correspond to the dimensions of the laboratory setup used for validating the numerical model section 2 4 2 1 1 independent parameters four independent dimensionless parameters were used to define the urban forms considered in the rectangular central area nx and ny the number of minor streets aligned along directions x and y the conveyance porosities ψx bx nx lx and ψy by ny ly where bx and by denote the widths of the minor streets all minor streets aligned along one direction were assumed of identical width the value of bx and by can then be computed from the values selected for the four independent parameters nx ny ψx ψy similarly the storage porosity ϕ of the central area is not another independent parameter as it can be evaluated as a function of ψx and ψy 1 ϕ 1 1 ψ x 1 ψ y ψ x ψ y ψ x ψ y the motivation for selecting parameters nx ny ψx and ψy to control the considered urban forms results from a trade off between realism of the generated urban forms and simplicity of the analyses as such the present research complements previous studies e g bruwier et al 2018 2020 which account for a broader range of urban parameters such as street curvature and orientation but lead to a level of complexity in the generated urban forms which makes impossible to unveil direct causative relationships between each urban parameter and the flow characteristics 2 1 2 reference configuration one urban form was selected as a reference and all other urban forms were obtained by changing a single independent parameter nx ny ψx or ψy while keeping the three others unchanged the urban form represented in fig 1 corresponds to the reference configuration it includes one minor street along direction x nx 1 and two minor streets along direction y ny 2 in this configuration the width of all minor streets was set to half the width of the main streets bx by b 2 the conveyance porosities ψx and ψy are 0 21 and 0 16 respectively although arbitrary to some extent the reference configuration was selected for its plausibility considering the extent and aspect ratio of the central area and a realistic ratio between the widths of the main streets and the minor streets 2 1 3 systematic variations of the independent parameters fig 2 displays the set of urban forms obtained by starting from the reference configuration and varying one independent parameter at a time the corresponding parameters are given in table 2 the numbers of minor streets nx and ny were varied systematically between 0 and 4 six different values between 0 and 0 63 were considered for the conveyance porosity ψx and six others for ψy between 0 and 0 47 two additional extreme configurations were included in the analysis one with a closed central area co and one with an open space in the central area ce 2 2 flooding scenario the flow depth is prescribed as the downstream boundary condition at each street outlet and the inflow discharge is prescribed as the upstream boundary condition at each street inlet to simplify the definition of the considered flooding scenario the downstream flow depth h0 is set equal at the three street outlets and the inflow discharge qin is also set to the same value at the three inlets therefore a flooding scenario is here entirely defined by one downstream flow depth and one inflow discharge the focus was set on urban flooding conditions representative of floodplains of lowland rivers to determine a plausible inflow discharge qin we introduced a characteristic froude number f defined based on the input data i e the flow depth h 0 0 outlet the inflow discharge qin and the width b of the main streets 2 f q in b h 0 g h 0 this represents the froude number which would be observed at the street outlets if the outflow discharge was distributed uniformly between the three outlets as it is at the inlets by assuming a value for f the inflow discharge qin at each inlet can be determined here the flow was assumed relatively slow with a characteristic froude number f of 0 2 consistent with typical values observed in floodplains of lowland rivers 2 3 numerical model for all configurations displayed in fig 2 numerical simulations were carried out with the same computational model and procedure as presented by li et al 2020 based on a finite volume technique the model solves the 2d shallow water equations on a cartesian grid with a depth averaged k ε turbulence model erpicum et al 2009 the bed shear stress is estimated by darcy weisbach formula a steady inflow discharge was prescribed at each inlet and equal flow depths were prescribed at the outlets the mesh spacing was set so that the grid includes 40computational cells over the width of the main streets results of mesh sensitivity analysis are displayed in supplement figure s1 some computed flow fields show small periodic fluctuations with a period considerably longer than the computational time step although their amplitude is extremely small below 1 for discharge and even smaller for flow depths the displayed results were time averaged over a duration sufficiently long compared to the period of the fluctuations this is further detailed in li et al 2020 2 4 laboratory experiments 2 4 1 experimental setup laboratory experiments were performed to validate the computational model the tests were conducted in the laboratory of engineering hydraulics at the university of liège belgium the experimental setup represents the urban configuration shown in fig 1 and is exactly the same as detailed by li et al 2021 except for the urban forms the bottom is flat and made of smooth pvc plates the roughness height ks is estimated at 5 10 5 m the side walls are vertical and made of 0 3 m high plexiglass plates the width of all streets is b 0 2 m representing a prototype street width of 10 m by applying a horizontal scale factor eh of 50 eh lp lm with lp and lm representing horizontal dimensions at prototype and model scale respectively the building blocks placed in the central part of the models are made of smooth plexiglass plates of 0 15 m in height the flow in the physical model is steady and water is recirculated in a closed loop system involving a bottom tank of 2 4 m3 in all tests the inflow discharge was set at the same value in each inlet flow depths at the downstream end of the streets were regulated with adjustable weirs and they were set at the same value at the three outlets 2 4 2 downscaling of flooding scenario downscaling the prototype scale flooding scenario defined in section 2 2 to the scale of the laboratory setup consists in determining the values of the flow depth to be prescribed experimentally at the street outlets and the discharge to be prescribed at the street inlets in the laboratory model scaling the flow depth from prototype conditions to the laboratory setup is performed by defining a vertical scale factor ev ev hp hm with hp and hm representing vertical dimensions at prototype and model scale respectively in urban flooding the horizontal dimensions street width and length 10 103 m are way larger than the vertical ones flow depth 10 1 1 m therefore opting for a vertical scale factor ev equal to the horizontal one eh leads generally to a too low reynolds number in the scale model leading to spurious effects due to water viscosity as well as particularly low flow depth and hence high relative measurements errors and spurious effects of surface tension consequently opting for a geometrically distorted scale model offers several benefits higher reynolds number lower relative measurement errors as detailed by li et al 2019 and li et al 2020 here we selected a vertical scale factor ev 5 which corresponds to a geometric distortion ratio d eh ev of 10 considering the flow depth at street outlet at the prototype scale be 0 5 m this leads to a flow depth prescribed at the model street outlets equal to h0 0 1 m to achieve similarity between the physical model and the prototype the characteristic froude number f was kept the same in the scale model as in the prototype this enables determining the inflow discharge qin at each street inlet in the scale model with eh 50 and ev 5 3 q in f b h 0 g h 0 3 96 l s the effect of model geometric distortion is further discussed in section 5 3 2 4 3 measurement techniques the three inflow discharges were monitored independently by three electromagnetic flowmeters simens mag 5100 w with an accuracy of 0 5 upstream flow depths were measured with ultrasonic sensors microsonic mic 35 iu tc with an accuracy of 1 mm to evaluate the partition of the outflow discharge between the streets the flow at each outlet was collected in a straight horizontal measurement channel width of 0 2 m and length of 1 5 m equipped with a 90 triangular sharp crested weir the outflow discharge in each measurement channel was estimated by means of calibrated rating curves based on the hydraulic head in the measurement channels as described by li et al 2021 to account for periodic fluctuations in the measured flow depths the signal from each ultrasonic sensor was recorded for a duration of 120 s at a frequency of 100 hz this enables characterizing both the time averaged value and the standard deviation of flow depths all measurements were repeated twice to ensure reproducibility of the results figure s2 in supplement the uncertainties affecting the measurement of the outflow discharge at each street outlet were discussed in detail by li et al 2021 they are in the range 0 5 1 5 surface velocity was measured by means of large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv which is a non intrusive and widely applied technique for field and laboratory measurements muste et al 2008 2014 peltier et al 2014 naves et al 2019 here a commercial camera lumix gh4 resolution of 1920 1080 pixels and recording rate of 25fps was placed 2 m above the laboratory model sawdust with a diameter ranging between 1 mm and 3 mm was used as a tracer its light color contrasts well with the pvc model bottom based on a convergence test figure s7 in supplement the duration of each video was fixed at 60 s i e 1500 images as detailed in supplement figure s4 to s6 the experimental model was covered by combining movies recorded from several viewpoints this enables minimizing hidden areas and increases the spatial resolution to 1 mm pixel the recorded image sequences were processed with software fudaa lspiv le coz et al 2014 which was extensively applied in the field zhu and lipeme kouyi 2019 and laboratory studies legout et al 2012 mejia morales et al 2021 three main steps were followed step 1 a 3 d orthorectification of the images was applied based on 10 to 20 ground reference points grp positioned at three different elevations z 0 m z 0 15 m and z 0 3 m see yellow points in fig 3 step 2 the surface velocity was calculated by tracking the path of particles in a predefined interrogation area ia over a selected search area sa as detailed by legout et al 2012 the considered ia extended over 20 pixels i e 0 02 m 0 02 m legout et al 2012 the size of the sa along each direction was adjusted as a function of the estimated magnitude of the maximum velocity along the respective directions the spacing interval of the points where the velocity was calculated is 0 01 m leading to 20 measurement points along the width of the main streets step 3 surface velocity fields were post processed by fudaa lspiv to filter out anomalous values based on thresholds applied on the velocity components the surface velocity close to the sidewalls of the model was deemed unreliable because the tracers were slowed down at the contact with the sidewall therefore computed surface velocities in a narrow strip of 1 cm along the sidewalls were discarded 3 assessment of the computational model the computational model was first assessed by comparison against laboratory experiments comparisons focus first on the flow depths measured upstream of each street points a b c and on the outflow discharge at each outlet section 3 1 next similarities and differences between the computed depth averaged flow velocity and the measured surface flow velocity are also discussed section 3 2 3 1 inlet flow depths and partition of outlet discharges for the five measured configurations ce co ref px5 and py5 fig 2 and table 2 the computed and observed upstream flow depths are shown in fig 4 a the standard deviations of measured and simulated flow depths among the different configurations are of the order of 0 7 mm and 0 001 mm respectively the difference between computed and observed values reaches a maximum of 1 mm which is the best possible agreement given the experimental uncertainties 1mm the quality of the agreement does not differ significantly from one geometric configuration to the other in three of the tested configurations co ref and py5 the portion of the total discharge reaching each of the three street outlets noted qr varies in a relatively narrow range when the geometric configuration is changed between 28 5 and 30 5 at outlet 1 between 22 5 and 25 at outlet 2 and between 46 5 and 47 5 at outlet 3 fig 4b outlet3 collects the highest portion of water as it is connected to inlets a and b by a single straight street outlet2 drains the lowest amount of water because it is the most distant from the inlets for all configurations except ce the transfer of water in the west east direction evaluated as q 2 q 3 is four times higher than the transfer in the north south direction evaluated as q 1 q 2 qin in configuration ce this ratio is close to two in configurationpx5 the portion of the flow reaching outlet2 28 is substantially higher than in configurationsco ref or py5 at the expense of outlet1 24 5 compared to 29 30 for the three other configurations this results from the high conveyance porosity ψx of px5 leading to more water originating from inlets a and b to be conveyed towards outlet2 in these four configurations co ref py5 and px5 the difference between computed and observed portions of discharge at the street outlets remains below 2 percentage points pp as can be seen in figure s3 in supplement as for the inlet flow depths this difference is comparable to the uncertainty affecting the experimental estimation of the outflow discharges section 2 4 as a result the obtained agreement between computational and experimental results is again the best possible given the accuracy of the laboratory setup in configuration ce i e open space in the central area the partition of the outflow discharge between outlets 2 and 3 differs considerably from that observed in the four other configurations the highest portion of outflow discharge is collected at outlet2 which is the outlet receiving the least water in configurationsco ce and py5 fig 4b in configurationce the absence of obstacles in the central area enables a strong flow crossing this area diagonally from inletsa and b towards outlet2 the computational model succeeds in capturing this change in the partition of the outflow discharge but it tends to slightly overestimate the measured discharge increase at outlet2 and decrease at outlet 3 figure s3 the difference between computed and observed portions of outflow discharge reaches 4 pp overall for most urban configurations the differences between the numerical predictions and the experimental observations do not exceed the experimental accuracy both for the flow depths at the street inlets and for the discharge partition between the street outlets only in configuration ce the difference between the computed and observed portions of outflow discharge reaches up to 4 pp which is higher than the experimental uncertainty this aspect is further discussed below based on the velocity fields 3 2 flow velocity fig 5 shows the measured surface velocity the computed depth averaged velocity as well as the difference between these two quantities the difference is normalized by a reference velocity 0 2 m s defined as the velocity which would be observed at the street outlets if the outflow discharge was distributed evenly between the three outlets since the observed and computed quantities do not correspond to the same flow variable surface vs depth averaged velocity there is no reason to expect a perfect agreement between the two indeed 3d flow structures downstream of street intersections are known to induce deviations between surface and depth averaged velocities li and zeng 2010 mignot et al 2013 nonetheless a high degree of dis similarity between the two quantities may hint at a low high overall level of confidence in the numerical predictions and may help with interpreting the dis agreement between observed and computed flow depths at street inlets and flow partition at street outlets in general the patterns of computed depth averaged velocity are found very similar to the patterns of observed surface velocity fig 5 in particular in the inlet sections the difference between the two does not exceed 5 i e 0 01 m s this may be considered as a partial validation of the accuracy of our lspiv technique similarly the computed depth averaged velocities and the observed surface velocities in the contraction zones immediately downstream of the street intersections are also very close this is shown in figure s9 in supplement which displays the cross sectional velocity profiles at x 0 8 m and x 1 m corresponding to the contraction zone for street b3 fig 1 further downstream i e for x 1 4 m the differences between the velocity profiles tend to grow suggesting that the recirculation lengths in the measured surface velocity and the computed depth averaged velocity differ downstream of the contraction zones the computed flow shows a more concentrated wall jet than in the observations leading to local differences between computations and observations of the order of 30 of the reference velocity fig 5 and figure s9 in supplement it is possible that such differences stem from the different physical natures of the observed and computed flow variables i e difference between surface and depth averaged velocities downstream of street intersection el kadi abderrezzak et al 2011 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2009 li and zeng 2010 mignot et al 2013 among others luo et al 2018 and li and zeng 2010 found a larger flow velocity close to the bottom than at the surface downstream of crossroads which is consistent with a higher depth averaged velocity than the surface velocity as obtained here the cumulative distribution function cdf of the differences between computed depth averaged velocity and observed surface velocity is displayed in fig 6 for configurations co ref and py5 the magnitude of the difference between the two quantities is in the range 10 10 over 60 of the flow domain and in the range 30 30 over 90 of the flow domain in configurations px5 and ce the cdf reveals stronger deviations as shown in fig 5 for configuration px5 the shape of the jet in the central part of the block differs between the observations and the computations in the former case the jet reattaches first against the obstacles located in the southern part of the central area and at mid length it reattaches to the obstacles located in the northern part in contrast in the simulations the jet remains reattached to the southern obstacles we consider as unlikely that this difference results from an actual deviation between depth averaged and surface velocities but it hints more likely at a limitation of the 2d computational model for configuration ce the jet in the observed surface velocity field shows more dispersion than in the computations and the observed large recirculation is more active in the observations than in the computations fig 5c the higher simulated velocity field close to outlet 2 is consistent with the overestimation of the outflow discharge at outlet 2 fig 4b again these differences are more likely to point at a limitation of the 2d model when applied to a wide open area than to reflect a real deviation between surface and depth averaged velocity fields 3 3 flow in the minor streets fig 7 provides a close look at the measured and computed flow fields in the minor streets for configurations ref px5 and py5 empty arrows in fig 7 indicate the direction of net exchange between the minor and main streets for the experiments we determined this direction based on the visualization of the tracers motion in the recorded videos the net flow exchange direction of numerical results is determined with the sign positive negative of exchange discharges see details in figure s12 in supplement in most cases the net exchange flow direction and the pattern of flow recirculation agree between the computations and the observations substantial differences occur in two cases i minor streets in which the net flow exchange is very small and therefore difficult to detect based on the tracers motion and ii in configurationpx5 for which the main jet trajectory is inaccurately represented in the computations as a consequence the rotation of small recirculations in the eastern minor streets is reversed in the numerical predictions compared to the observations overall computed depth averaged velocity and observed surface velocity are very similar particularly in the inlet sections as well as in the vena contracta in contrast downstream of contraction zones the computed jet remains more concentrated at the sidewall than in the observations also in two configurations px5 and ce the trajectories of jets are not accurately captured by the computations in the next section we present a systematic assessment of the influence of urban forms on flow variables while keeping in mind the possible limitations of the computational model 4 results based on computations we detail here the influence of urban forms on the upstream flow depths the discharge partition at the outlets and the exchange discharge between the central area and the adjacent main streets the upstream flow depths and discharge partition at the outlets were selected for their ability to unveil upstream downstream impacts of a particular urban form indeed the flow depths at the inlets reflect the influence of the tested urban forms on the severity of flooding further upstream while the discharge partition indicates how the tested urban forms may affect the distribution of flooding hazard further downstream finally the magnitude of the exchange discharge between the central area and the main streets reveals information on the local flow processes within the considered urban block note that figure s10 in supplement displays the computed velocity fields for all tested configurations 4 1 upstream flow depths and discharge partition for all tested configurations fig 8 shows the variation of the inlet flow depths and outlet discharge partitions compared to the results obtained in the reference configuration 4 δ h i h i h ref h ref and δ q r i q r i q r r e f where subscript i refers to a particular urban form subscript ref refers to the reference configuration h denotes the flow depth at a particular street inlet a b or c and qr the fraction of the total outflow discharge which is drained by a particular outlet 1 2 or 3 overall fig 8a reveals that varying the urban forms does not change significantly the upstream flow depths max 1 this results from the relatively low froude number considered here in contrast the discharge partition at the street outlets is more sensitive to changes in the urban form particularly at outlet 2 where it may vary by up to 6 pp compared to the reference configuration fig 8b 4 1 1 effect of varying the number of minor streets when the number nx of minor streets along x is varied from 1 to 4 the conveyance porosities ψx and ψy being kept constant the outflow discharge at outlet 2 decreases monotonously and vice versa at outlet 1 this reflects a higher flow resistance across the urban form along the x direction as nx is increased hence impeding the transfer of water from west to east towards outlet2 this is consistent with an increase in flow resistance when a flow path of a given total width becomes fragmented into several narrower paths leading to a larger total wetted perimeter for the same total cross sectional area ψx being constant the results obtained with the highest number of minor streets nx4 are close to those of the extreme case co which involves an impermeable central area fig 8b when the number ny of minor streets along direction y is varied the partition of the outflow discharge is barely affected indeed flow recirculations occupy a large portion of those minor streets as depicted in fig 5 and fig 7 hence irrespective of their number the minor streets along y tend not to convey a significant amount of flow for all tested configurations except ce fig 5 also shows a considerable flow momentum in the main street linking inlet b to outlet 3 this tends to impede the deviation of water towards the minor streets aligned along direction y chen et al 2018 showcased a similar effect in a synthetic network of streets where the main streets were shown to act as flow separators inhibiting flow exchanges with minor streets on their sides the anisotropic geometry and boundary conditions considered here lead to a greater transfer of water from west to east than from north to south and thus contrasting influences of nx and ny the anisotropy of the setup is also the reason why the results of configurations co and ce which appear as two extremes from a geometrical perspective do not provide an envelope of the results obtained with the other configurations in fig 8b 4 1 2 effect of varying the conveyance porosities when the conveyance porosity ψx is varied the partition of the outflow discharge is strongly modified see configurations px0 to px5 in fig 8b the range of the variation reaches up to 8 pp at outlet 2 which corresponds to an increase by one third of the outflow discharge at this outlet when ψx is varied from 0 px0 to 0 63 px5 conversely the outflow at outlet 1 is reduced by 7 pp for the same change in ψx as for nx modifying ψx influences directly the resistance to the dominating flow transfer i e along the west east direction this transfer increases as ψx increases in contrast changes in the conveyance porosity ψy py1 to py5 have a milder influence on the outflow discharge partition the ranges of variation are 3 to 5 times smaller than in the case of variations in ψx with an opposite tendency west east transfers decrease as ψy increases 4 1 3 comparison with experimental results fig 8 also displays the experimental results for the configurations tested in the lab ce co ref px5 and py5 the variations in flow depths at the inlets show some disagreements between the computations and the observations e g for configurations co px5 and py5 but these effects lie all in the range of uncertainty of the experimental observations for the outflow discharges the computations and the observations lead in all cases to the same direction of change with regards to the reference in configuration co the predicted and measured values of the change at all street outlets are even in perfect agreement as shown by the corresponding symbols being perfectly aligned in fig 8b for configurations px5 and py5 some differences are observed between experimental and numerical results but they fall all in the range of the experimental uncertainties 1 to 2 pp 4 2 exchange discharge with the central area in addition to the flow depth at the street inlets and the discharge partition at the street outlets we also examined the exchange discharges qe between the main streets and the central area that contains the minor streets normalized by the total inflow discharge this quantity represents the portion of the inflow discharge that is conveyed through the minor streets it enables assessing the contribution of the central area to the overall flow conveyance depending on the urban form to evaluate the exchange discharge qe we summed up the integrals over the street width of the computed depth averaged velocity profiles at each inlet of a minor street considering only those with flow entering the central area qe in or only those with flow leaving the central area qe out owing to mass conservation qe in qe out qe details of the computation are given in figure s12 in supplement unfortunately the experiments do not give access to this information since the observed surface velocity field is not sufficient to precisely infer the flow discharge in each street for each urban configuration involving minor streets fig 9 shows the inlet and outlet exchange discharges qe in and qe out and it highlights the contribution of each face west north east south of the central area to the total exchange discharge qe in or qe out in all configurations except those in the group px qe varies in a very narrow range between 8 and 11 of the total inflow discharge in contrast when the conveyance porosity ψx increases the exchange discharge increases dramatically by up to two orders of magnitude in configuration px0 qe represents 0 2 of the total inflow discharge while it reaches 18 of the inflow discharge in configurationpx5 ψx 0 63 this result explains to a great extent why the partition of outflow discharge is far more influenced by ψx than it is by the three other parameters nx ny and ψy irrespective of the urban configuration water flowing through the central area enters mainly through the west face fig 9a it flows towards the east face and to a lesser extent towards the south and north faces fig 9b the partition of the exchange discharge qe out between these three faces is strongly dependent on the urban configuration except for the group ny while qe increases monotonously when the conveyance porosity ψx increases the evolution of qe with the other parameters nx ny and ψy is slightly non monotonous due to several mechanisms when the number of minor street nx increases the portion of the exchange flow entering the west face remains virtually constant while the portion entering the east face evolves non monotonously leading to a non monotonous evolution of the total exchange discharge moreover when nx is increased above2 the discharge leaving the central area through the east face decreases indicating a higher resistance faced by the flow passing through the urban form from west to east this is consistent with the variation of the discharge partition with nx when ψy is varied from 0 08 to 0 47 the exchange discharges through the north and south faces are hardly modified fig 9b since the minor streets aligned along y axis are mostly occupied by large flow recirculations fig 10 the computed flow fields in the minor streets are presented in figure s17 in supplement for all the configurations 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with bruwier et al 2018 although the building coverage or storage porosity of an urban district is certainly an important characteristic of urban forms bruwier et al 2018 emphasized the stronger influence of the district scale conveyance porosity compared to the storage porosity on the examined flow variables particularly the upstream flow depths in the case of long duration riverine flooding or runoff from upstream catchment the present results are in agreement with bruwier et al 2018 conclusions in particular the storage porosity ϕ indicated in the last column of table 2 alone does not enable predicting the direction nor the magnitude of the trends in the flow variables of interest as demonstrated in fig 11 hence although the building coverage as used also by dong et al 2021 appears as a correct predictor of flow variables when the source of water is the rain falling over the considered urban area löwe et al 2017 bruwier et al 2020 this parameter is not suitable when the water originates from riverine flooding or runoff volumes drained from further upstream of the considered urban area our results point out the contrasting influence of the conveyance porosities ψx and ψy the former affects directly the direction in which the strongest flow transfer occurs so that it has a considerably stronger effect on the flow variables particularly the partition of the outflow discharge fig 8b this aspect could be highlighted here because our setup is non isotropic in the sense that the overall flow transfer along the north south direction differs from the transfer in the west east direction in contrast bruwier et al 2018 were unable to draw attention to these directional effects since their setup was isotropic as regards the boundary conditions and the outer geometry of the tested urban forms another key point of bruwier et al 2018 work was that more fragmented urban forms i e shorter street length and larger building side back tend to reduce the flooding severity upstream of the considered urban area however it was not clear whether the concept of fragmentation refers to a number of voids such as our parameters nx and ny or the actual portion of a cross sectional available for flow conveyance similarly to ψx and ψy indeed bruwier et al 2018 did not analyze the influence of modifying the number of streets while keeping the conveyance porosity constant their urban forms were generated randomly so that several parameters varied simultaneously in contrast based on our systematic approach we have been able to disentangle the overwhelming influence of the conveyance porosity compared to that of the number of streets in a particular direction fig 8 5 2 effect of bottom and sidewall roughness similarly to li et al 2020 all computational results presented in section 4 were obtained by considering smooth bottom and side walls the roughness height was assumed equal to ks 5 10 5 m to assess the influence of this assumption on the results a series of computations was repeated with a considerably larger value for the roughness height ks 10 3 m considering a vertical scale factor ev 5 section 2 4 this value of ks corresponds to 5 mm at the prototype scale which is a plausible value for typical material encountered in real world urban districts these additional computations were carried out for configurations px1 ref px2 px3 px4 and px5 which lead to the strongest variations in the flow characteristics the flow depths computed with ks 10 3 m are systematically higher than those computed with ks 5 10 5 but the differences do not exceed 0 5 mm figure s22a similarly the differences in the discharge partition for both roughness values are very small below 1p p figure s22b besides the variation of these two flow characteristics with the urban form fig 12 a b remains consistent with those obtained for the lower value of roughness fig 8a b finally the roughness doesn t seem to have any substantial influence on the exchange discharge qe nor on its directional distribution as can be inferred by comparing fig 12c d with fig 9 this enables concluding that the findings presented in section 4 are not altered when the value of the roughness height is varied 5 3 extrapolation to the prototype scale additional computations were performed to evaluate the validity of extrapolating to the real world the findings obtained based on a reduced scale model of urban flooding when setting these computations both the district geometry and the hydraulic boundary conditions were upscaled to the prototype scale in line with section 2 4 the focus was set on the series of configurations px1 ref px2 px3 px4 px5 which shows the highest influence on the flow characteristics fig 8 and fig 9 a roughness height ks 0 005 m was assumed as shown in figure s18 in supplement the results remain very similar between the computations conducted for the reduced scale model and those at prototype scale both the flow depths at the inlets and the discharge partitions at the outlets are consistent irrespective of the scale at all inlets and outlets the direction of change of these flow variables with ψx is not altered and although not identical the magnitudes of the variations are also similar at both scales e g 1p p difference in terms of discharge partition the same observations apply for the exchange discharges qe in and qe out in the five tested configurations figure s19 although the flow direction is reversed in some of the minor streets but this corresponds to tiny contributions to the total exchange discharge figure s20 at prototype scale for all values of ψx the flow enters the central area through the north and west sides and leaves this area through the south and east sides figure s21 whereas at the reduced scale the flow direction in some of the minor streets varies with ψx this difference results from the change in the flow aspect ratio between the reduced scale model and the prototype scale but it does not undermine the conclusions of the present study since the discharge flowing through these minor streets contributes little to the overall exchange flow 5 4 limitations of the study this study contains some limitations first only a part of a synthetic street network was analyzed together with a limited number of urban forms although the considered geometry was selected so that it includes a variety of crossroad types and building patterns it is certainly not representative of all settings possibly encountered in real world urban fabrics this may limit the extrapolations of our findings to other practical situations conversely the selected geometry together with the hydraulic boundary conditions has the merit of highlighting the non isotropic behavior of asymmetrical urban districts another limitation stems from the fixed hydraulic boundary conditions considered throughout the study as detailed in section 2 2 it was chosen representative of typical long duration flooding conditions in floodplains of lowland rivers nonetheless we believe that most conclusions would remain unchanged if the hydraulic boundary conditions were varied particularly the ranking of the urban forms in terms of their influence on the flow variables for instance increasing the inflow discharge would mainly magnify the magnitude of the influence of the urban characteristics on the flow variables but it would certainly not reverse the trends this effect was shown by arrault et al 2016 based on a laboratory model of an urban district in which the inflow discharge was varied over one order of magnitude the scaling chosen for the laboratory experiments involving a geometric distortion of 10 section 2 4 could also be questioned note that compared to the case of a geometrically undistorted model the geometric distortion enables obtaining a reynolds number in the laboratory model closer to that at prototype scale at the expense of altering the aspect ratio of the flow sections it also reduces the relative importance of measurement uncertainties li et al 2020 quantified the effects of varying the geometric distortion for the case of configuration co fig 13 a b here we repeated a similar analysis for the reference configuration ref while the laboratory observations used in section 3 were all based on a geometric distortion of 10 we repeated the measurements and computations with six other values of d ranging between 1 6 and 12 5 fig 13c d in both configurations co and ref the results are barely affected by the distortion ratio provided that this ratio remains above 5 only for d 5 a substantial influence of d is observed due to a magnified effect of flow resistance as the geometric distortion and hence the flow depths are reduced this leads to variations by up to 5 of the inlet flow depths and by 10 pp of the outlet discharge moreover the computational model captures reliably the influence of geometric distortion on the results irrespective of the particular urban configuration co or ref 6 conclusion based on experimental and computational modelling we analyzed how flow variables flow depths discharge partition and velocity field in urban flooding are influenced by a particular set of urban forms the considered urban forms consist of a regular network of orthogonal streets they are characterized by four parameters which were systematically varied the most striking result of the study is the overwhelming influence of just a single parameter the conveyance porosity along the direction of dominating flow compared to the three others conveyance porosity in the normal direction as well as the numbers of streets along each direction this result stems from the anisotropy of the considered geometric and hydraulic setting in which water transfer along one direction west east is roughly four times stronger than along the normal direction north south this effect was not revealed in similar recent studies e g bruwier et al 2018 which considered more isotropic geometric and hydraulic boundary conditions it suggests also that in the tested configurations the building coverage or building density which is isotropic is not a suitable predictor of the effect of urbanization on flooding from a practical perspective this finding suggests that when a preferential flow direction can be identified new developments altering the conveyance porosity along this direction should be scrutinized with great care this effect should act as a constraint in the design of new developments in floodplains vice versa the limited influence of the conveyance porosity and the number of streets along the direction normal to the main flow offer an opportunity for new developments which do not increase flooding severity and may safely be constructed provided they are flood proof themselves moreover the relatively high conveyance porosity along the main flow direction should be ensured based on a limited number of flow paths e g few wide streets and not multiple narrower streets as our analyses highlight that fragmenting a flow path into several ones by increasing nx increases the flow resistance detailed comparisons between laboratory observations and computational results are another key outcome of the present study it reveals the ability of a 2d computational model to capture the most typical flow features of urban flooding in a street network in contrast more substantial deviations were pointed out between computations and observations in configurations ce and px5 which involve an open area for engineering practitioners this result hints at the need for a critical assessment of computational predictions when open areas such as large squares are modelled in 2d furthermore the experimental dataset collected here may prove valuable for the validation of other urban flood models such as porosity models ferrari et al 2019 varra et al 2019 ferrari and viero 2020 in a broad range of urban settings although the geometry and hydraulic boundary conditions considered here were selected to represent a variety of urban flooding conditions e g various crossroads with three or four branches while remaining sufficiently generic they are certainly not representative of all urbanistic configurations which may arise in real world urban areas dottori et al 2013 therefore the present study should be complemented by the analysis of many more urban configurations and hydraulic scenarios by means of a stochastic framework as well as the study of real world cases and data e g paquier et al 2020 including steeper terrain slopes and shorter flooding durations el kadi abderrezzak et al 2009 similarly further research is needed on the interplay between urban design and other flow controlling factors in urban flooding such as surcharging urban drainage martins et al 2018 rubinato et al 2018 beg et al 2020 flow intrusion into buildings mignot et al 2020 green infrastructures rosenberger et al 2021 the relative importance of these processes should be examined not only in light of the flow characteristics but also in terms of induced damage dottori et al 2016 molinari et al 2020 finally novel methods such as 3d virtual environments

3908,water sensitive urban design is an integral part of flood risk management based on computational modelling we investigated the influence of various urban forms on flooding severity at the level of an urban block and for the case of long duration urban flooding the upstream flow depths downstream discharge partition and flow exchange through the urban forms were examined the results indicate that one urban characteristic has an overwhelming influence on the flow variables the conveyance porosity in the main flow direction is by far more influential than the conveyance porosity in the normal direction or the number of streets such anisotropic effect was not pointed in recent similar studies and it hints at practical guidelines for sustainable urban planning in practice moreover the computational model was verified against laboratory observations which constitute a novel valuable dataset for the validation of other urban flooding models keywords urban flooding urban forms flood resilience laboratory model numerical modelling 1 introduction 1 1 need for flood resilient urban design worldwide urban flooding causes huge economic losses and a high number of fatalities kreibich et al 2019 the impacts of urban flooding are rising as a result of rapid urbanization and more frequent extreme rainfall events chen et al 2015 muis et al 2015 yin et al 2015 this trend puts urban flood risk modelling and management as a global priority guo et al 2020 nkwunonwo et al 2020 rosenzweig et al 2021 experience has shown that effectively mitigating urban flood risk is only possible if the scope of urban flood risk management is extended well beyond traditional approaches such as upgrade of flood defenses and urban drainage systems la loggia et al 2020 rosenberger et al 2021 among other aspects concepts such as water sensitive urban planning or sponge cities are increasingly considered as an integral part of urban flood risk management qin 2020 yin et al 2021 löwe et al 2017 suggest that flood resilient urban planning may be economically more efficient than upgrading the drainage system in a context of uncertain future climate similarly based on multiple urbanization scenarios at the regional level mustafa et al 2018 pointed out that future flood risk will be strongly influenced by spatial planning policies the arrangement of buildings is a major component of urban planning the resulting urban forms affect not only flood vulnerability but also flood hazard indeed the layout of buildings in floodplains alters the flow paths leandro et al 2016 so that flood hazard is changed both in magnitude and in terms of spatial distribution upstream depths and downstream discharges lin et al 2020 showcased the importance of geometric parameters characterizing the arrangement of buildings on pluvial flooding hotspots in a real world urban district shenzhen china hence the influence of urban forms on flooding is an important aspect of flood resilient urban design yin et al 2021 1 2 existing experimental and numerical studies on urban forms urban flooding was extensively studied over the last few years teng et al 2017 mignot et al 2019 tesema and abebe 2020 but the influence of urban forms on flooding has received relatively little attention table 1 lists existing computational and experimental studies dedicated to the impacts of variations in the arrangement of buildings on flow patterns as detailed below the most widely investigated parameters include building density cea et al 2010 huang et al 2014 guillén et al 2017 dong et al 2021 street or building orientation herbich and shulits 1964 soares frazão and zech 2008 velickovic et al 2017 street width tomiczek et al 2016 velickovic et al 2017 and building positioning aligned vs staggered testa et al 2007 cea et al 2010 goseberg 2013 isidoro et al 2013 based on an outdoor scale model of a river valley in which a dam break induced flood wave was simulated testa et al 2007 performed pointwise measurements of flow depth evolution for two distinct building arrangements aligned and staggered buildings in a laboratory setup operated with steady inflow velickovic et al 2017 investigated the distribution of flow depths for five arrangements of buildings which differed by the orientation of the streets with respect to the direction of approaching flow and by the street widths huang et al 2014 measured flow depths in a series of laboratory experiments involving building arrangements characterized by seven different building coverage ratios in these three studies no other flow variable than flow depth was analyzed tomiczek et al 2016 investigated the influence of the spacing between buildings on turbulence and hydrodynamic loads on buildings during a tsunami wave submersion recently laboratory observations by dong et al 2021 suggested a lower influence of the building arrangement compared to the effect of urban drainage in the case of a dam break wave however the setup was limited to a single street and only two values of building density were tested two experimental studies investigated the influence of building arrangements on pluvial flooding cea et al 2010 tested eight different building arrangements and measured the runoff hydrograph at the outlet of the urban area their analysis focused on the validation of two computational models isidoro et al 2013 considered a fixed building density but they varied the rooftop connectivity a substantial influence on runoff hydrographs was observed with reductions in peak discharges of the runoff hydrograph when the building rooftops are more clustered overall in all previous experimental studies the velocity fields and discharge partitions within the built area were not comprehensively investigated moreover the number of tested configurations remained generally limited which restrains the possibility of reaching conclusive results of broad interest particularly no experimental study so far performed a systematic analysis of relatively complex urban forms involving street intersections of several types a limited number of studies used computational modelling to bring insights into the influence of urban forms on flooding for a case study in melbourne australia löwe et al 2017 estimated future flood risk under various scenarios of urban development and rain intensities they highlighted that water sensitive urban design appears as effective as other flood adaption strategies e g rainwater harvesting tanks or increase of the pipe network capacity for reducing flood hazard however the so called water sensitive urban design of löwe et al 2017 shows essentially a lower building coverage i e more multi storey apartment buildings while subtler effects of urban forms on flooding mechanisms were not investigated based on computations involving 2 000 synthetic arrangements of buildings bruwier et al 2018 analyzed the sensitivity of flow depths with respect to nine urban geometric parameters typical street length width and curvature building coverage etc for the case of river flooding their main findings suggest i a dominating influence of the district level conveyance porosity ratio of voids in a cross sectional area over the whole area and ii that more fragmented urban forms i e larger and more numerous spaces in between buildings tend to reduce flooding severity based on the outcomes of bruwier et al 2018 mustafa et al 2020 demonstrated a procedure for the automatic design of flood sensitive urban layouts by combining an optimization algorithm an efficient hydraulic model and procedural modelling for the parameterized generation of urban layouts bruwier et al 2020 extended the analysis to the case of pluvial flooding showing that in this particular case urban density building coverage is a suitable explanatory variable for predicting the influence of building arrangement on flow depth water storage and runoff hydrograph these computational studies showcase the substantial influence of urban characteristics on flow variables during urban flooding but they involve specific flow patterns in complex urban layouts for which neither field nor laboratory validation data exist moreover comprehensive research involving thousands of urban forms bruwier et al 2018 2020 allowed deriving statistical regressions between urban parameters and flood danger but the flow patterns were too complex to enable direct physical interpretation and a sound understanding of the flow processes at stake therefore we aim here at conducting a more in depth systematic analysis of a limited number of geometric parameters under more controlled flow conditions i e simpler settings 1 3 objective in the present research we combine computational modelling and laboratory experiments to study the influence of urban forms on flow characteristics over a building block i e the area encompassed between four intersecting streets the experimental tests allow detailed validation of the computational model based on a restricted number of representative urban configurations while the computations enable a more systematic assessment of the influence of urban forms on flow processes a series of nineteen urban forms were considered they were generated by varying the arrangement of buildings as well as the number and width of minor streets inside a building block these variations either lead to a change in the conveyance porosity of the building block or to a change in the number of minor streets with the aim of disentangling the relative importance of the different effects we performed two dimensional numerical simulations for all considered urban forms and typical river flooding conditions the results obtained for five out of nineteen urban forms were verified in dedicated laboratory experiments the laboratory dataset includes pointwise flow depth measurements upstream of the urban block discharge partition at the street outlets as well as surface flow velocity measured by large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv section 2 describes the overall methodology while the validation of the computational model is detailed in section 3 the numerical results are presented in section 4 and discussed in section 5 and conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 data and methods our overall methodology consists of four steps i define urban forms ii for a limited number of them verify the numerical model by comparing against experimental data iii perform systematic numerical simulations to assess the influence of urban forms on the flow variables iv conclude on the influence of urban forms on flow variables the considered urban forms are introduced in section 2 1 and the flooding scenario in section 2 2 together with the examined flow variables the numerical model is briefly presented in section 2 3 while section 2 4 provides a description of the laboratory experiments 2 1 urban forms to assess the influence of urban forms on flow characteristics we considered a part of a synthetic urban district as shown in fig 1 it involves two main streets along one direction and two main streets in the normal direction forming four crossroads with three or four branches the width of the main streets is noted b and was kept constant various urban forms were defined inside the central rectangular area surrounded by the four main streets the size of this area is ly 6 4 b along direction x and lx 2 4 b along direction y these values are plausible and they correspond to the dimensions of the laboratory setup used for validating the numerical model section 2 4 2 1 1 independent parameters four independent dimensionless parameters were used to define the urban forms considered in the rectangular central area nx and ny the number of minor streets aligned along directions x and y the conveyance porosities ψx bx nx lx and ψy by ny ly where bx and by denote the widths of the minor streets all minor streets aligned along one direction were assumed of identical width the value of bx and by can then be computed from the values selected for the four independent parameters nx ny ψx ψy similarly the storage porosity ϕ of the central area is not another independent parameter as it can be evaluated as a function of ψx and ψy 1 ϕ 1 1 ψ x 1 ψ y ψ x ψ y ψ x ψ y the motivation for selecting parameters nx ny ψx and ψy to control the considered urban forms results from a trade off between realism of the generated urban forms and simplicity of the analyses as such the present research complements previous studies e g bruwier et al 2018 2020 which account for a broader range of urban parameters such as street curvature and orientation but lead to a level of complexity in the generated urban forms which makes impossible to unveil direct causative relationships between each urban parameter and the flow characteristics 2 1 2 reference configuration one urban form was selected as a reference and all other urban forms were obtained by changing a single independent parameter nx ny ψx or ψy while keeping the three others unchanged the urban form represented in fig 1 corresponds to the reference configuration it includes one minor street along direction x nx 1 and two minor streets along direction y ny 2 in this configuration the width of all minor streets was set to half the width of the main streets bx by b 2 the conveyance porosities ψx and ψy are 0 21 and 0 16 respectively although arbitrary to some extent the reference configuration was selected for its plausibility considering the extent and aspect ratio of the central area and a realistic ratio between the widths of the main streets and the minor streets 2 1 3 systematic variations of the independent parameters fig 2 displays the set of urban forms obtained by starting from the reference configuration and varying one independent parameter at a time the corresponding parameters are given in table 2 the numbers of minor streets nx and ny were varied systematically between 0 and 4 six different values between 0 and 0 63 were considered for the conveyance porosity ψx and six others for ψy between 0 and 0 47 two additional extreme configurations were included in the analysis one with a closed central area co and one with an open space in the central area ce 2 2 flooding scenario the flow depth is prescribed as the downstream boundary condition at each street outlet and the inflow discharge is prescribed as the upstream boundary condition at each street inlet to simplify the definition of the considered flooding scenario the downstream flow depth h0 is set equal at the three street outlets and the inflow discharge qin is also set to the same value at the three inlets therefore a flooding scenario is here entirely defined by one downstream flow depth and one inflow discharge the focus was set on urban flooding conditions representative of floodplains of lowland rivers to determine a plausible inflow discharge qin we introduced a characteristic froude number f defined based on the input data i e the flow depth h 0 0 outlet the inflow discharge qin and the width b of the main streets 2 f q in b h 0 g h 0 this represents the froude number which would be observed at the street outlets if the outflow discharge was distributed uniformly between the three outlets as it is at the inlets by assuming a value for f the inflow discharge qin at each inlet can be determined here the flow was assumed relatively slow with a characteristic froude number f of 0 2 consistent with typical values observed in floodplains of lowland rivers 2 3 numerical model for all configurations displayed in fig 2 numerical simulations were carried out with the same computational model and procedure as presented by li et al 2020 based on a finite volume technique the model solves the 2d shallow water equations on a cartesian grid with a depth averaged k ε turbulence model erpicum et al 2009 the bed shear stress is estimated by darcy weisbach formula a steady inflow discharge was prescribed at each inlet and equal flow depths were prescribed at the outlets the mesh spacing was set so that the grid includes 40computational cells over the width of the main streets results of mesh sensitivity analysis are displayed in supplement figure s1 some computed flow fields show small periodic fluctuations with a period considerably longer than the computational time step although their amplitude is extremely small below 1 for discharge and even smaller for flow depths the displayed results were time averaged over a duration sufficiently long compared to the period of the fluctuations this is further detailed in li et al 2020 2 4 laboratory experiments 2 4 1 experimental setup laboratory experiments were performed to validate the computational model the tests were conducted in the laboratory of engineering hydraulics at the university of liège belgium the experimental setup represents the urban configuration shown in fig 1 and is exactly the same as detailed by li et al 2021 except for the urban forms the bottom is flat and made of smooth pvc plates the roughness height ks is estimated at 5 10 5 m the side walls are vertical and made of 0 3 m high plexiglass plates the width of all streets is b 0 2 m representing a prototype street width of 10 m by applying a horizontal scale factor eh of 50 eh lp lm with lp and lm representing horizontal dimensions at prototype and model scale respectively the building blocks placed in the central part of the models are made of smooth plexiglass plates of 0 15 m in height the flow in the physical model is steady and water is recirculated in a closed loop system involving a bottom tank of 2 4 m3 in all tests the inflow discharge was set at the same value in each inlet flow depths at the downstream end of the streets were regulated with adjustable weirs and they were set at the same value at the three outlets 2 4 2 downscaling of flooding scenario downscaling the prototype scale flooding scenario defined in section 2 2 to the scale of the laboratory setup consists in determining the values of the flow depth to be prescribed experimentally at the street outlets and the discharge to be prescribed at the street inlets in the laboratory model scaling the flow depth from prototype conditions to the laboratory setup is performed by defining a vertical scale factor ev ev hp hm with hp and hm representing vertical dimensions at prototype and model scale respectively in urban flooding the horizontal dimensions street width and length 10 103 m are way larger than the vertical ones flow depth 10 1 1 m therefore opting for a vertical scale factor ev equal to the horizontal one eh leads generally to a too low reynolds number in the scale model leading to spurious effects due to water viscosity as well as particularly low flow depth and hence high relative measurements errors and spurious effects of surface tension consequently opting for a geometrically distorted scale model offers several benefits higher reynolds number lower relative measurement errors as detailed by li et al 2019 and li et al 2020 here we selected a vertical scale factor ev 5 which corresponds to a geometric distortion ratio d eh ev of 10 considering the flow depth at street outlet at the prototype scale be 0 5 m this leads to a flow depth prescribed at the model street outlets equal to h0 0 1 m to achieve similarity between the physical model and the prototype the characteristic froude number f was kept the same in the scale model as in the prototype this enables determining the inflow discharge qin at each street inlet in the scale model with eh 50 and ev 5 3 q in f b h 0 g h 0 3 96 l s the effect of model geometric distortion is further discussed in section 5 3 2 4 3 measurement techniques the three inflow discharges were monitored independently by three electromagnetic flowmeters simens mag 5100 w with an accuracy of 0 5 upstream flow depths were measured with ultrasonic sensors microsonic mic 35 iu tc with an accuracy of 1 mm to evaluate the partition of the outflow discharge between the streets the flow at each outlet was collected in a straight horizontal measurement channel width of 0 2 m and length of 1 5 m equipped with a 90 triangular sharp crested weir the outflow discharge in each measurement channel was estimated by means of calibrated rating curves based on the hydraulic head in the measurement channels as described by li et al 2021 to account for periodic fluctuations in the measured flow depths the signal from each ultrasonic sensor was recorded for a duration of 120 s at a frequency of 100 hz this enables characterizing both the time averaged value and the standard deviation of flow depths all measurements were repeated twice to ensure reproducibility of the results figure s2 in supplement the uncertainties affecting the measurement of the outflow discharge at each street outlet were discussed in detail by li et al 2021 they are in the range 0 5 1 5 surface velocity was measured by means of large scale particle image velocimetry lspiv which is a non intrusive and widely applied technique for field and laboratory measurements muste et al 2008 2014 peltier et al 2014 naves et al 2019 here a commercial camera lumix gh4 resolution of 1920 1080 pixels and recording rate of 25fps was placed 2 m above the laboratory model sawdust with a diameter ranging between 1 mm and 3 mm was used as a tracer its light color contrasts well with the pvc model bottom based on a convergence test figure s7 in supplement the duration of each video was fixed at 60 s i e 1500 images as detailed in supplement figure s4 to s6 the experimental model was covered by combining movies recorded from several viewpoints this enables minimizing hidden areas and increases the spatial resolution to 1 mm pixel the recorded image sequences were processed with software fudaa lspiv le coz et al 2014 which was extensively applied in the field zhu and lipeme kouyi 2019 and laboratory studies legout et al 2012 mejia morales et al 2021 three main steps were followed step 1 a 3 d orthorectification of the images was applied based on 10 to 20 ground reference points grp positioned at three different elevations z 0 m z 0 15 m and z 0 3 m see yellow points in fig 3 step 2 the surface velocity was calculated by tracking the path of particles in a predefined interrogation area ia over a selected search area sa as detailed by legout et al 2012 the considered ia extended over 20 pixels i e 0 02 m 0 02 m legout et al 2012 the size of the sa along each direction was adjusted as a function of the estimated magnitude of the maximum velocity along the respective directions the spacing interval of the points where the velocity was calculated is 0 01 m leading to 20 measurement points along the width of the main streets step 3 surface velocity fields were post processed by fudaa lspiv to filter out anomalous values based on thresholds applied on the velocity components the surface velocity close to the sidewalls of the model was deemed unreliable because the tracers were slowed down at the contact with the sidewall therefore computed surface velocities in a narrow strip of 1 cm along the sidewalls were discarded 3 assessment of the computational model the computational model was first assessed by comparison against laboratory experiments comparisons focus first on the flow depths measured upstream of each street points a b c and on the outflow discharge at each outlet section 3 1 next similarities and differences between the computed depth averaged flow velocity and the measured surface flow velocity are also discussed section 3 2 3 1 inlet flow depths and partition of outlet discharges for the five measured configurations ce co ref px5 and py5 fig 2 and table 2 the computed and observed upstream flow depths are shown in fig 4 a the standard deviations of measured and simulated flow depths among the different configurations are of the order of 0 7 mm and 0 001 mm respectively the difference between computed and observed values reaches a maximum of 1 mm which is the best possible agreement given the experimental uncertainties 1mm the quality of the agreement does not differ significantly from one geometric configuration to the other in three of the tested configurations co ref and py5 the portion of the total discharge reaching each of the three street outlets noted qr varies in a relatively narrow range when the geometric configuration is changed between 28 5 and 30 5 at outlet 1 between 22 5 and 25 at outlet 2 and between 46 5 and 47 5 at outlet 3 fig 4b outlet3 collects the highest portion of water as it is connected to inlets a and b by a single straight street outlet2 drains the lowest amount of water because it is the most distant from the inlets for all configurations except ce the transfer of water in the west east direction evaluated as q 2 q 3 is four times higher than the transfer in the north south direction evaluated as q 1 q 2 qin in configuration ce this ratio is close to two in configurationpx5 the portion of the flow reaching outlet2 28 is substantially higher than in configurationsco ref or py5 at the expense of outlet1 24 5 compared to 29 30 for the three other configurations this results from the high conveyance porosity ψx of px5 leading to more water originating from inlets a and b to be conveyed towards outlet2 in these four configurations co ref py5 and px5 the difference between computed and observed portions of discharge at the street outlets remains below 2 percentage points pp as can be seen in figure s3 in supplement as for the inlet flow depths this difference is comparable to the uncertainty affecting the experimental estimation of the outflow discharges section 2 4 as a result the obtained agreement between computational and experimental results is again the best possible given the accuracy of the laboratory setup in configuration ce i e open space in the central area the partition of the outflow discharge between outlets 2 and 3 differs considerably from that observed in the four other configurations the highest portion of outflow discharge is collected at outlet2 which is the outlet receiving the least water in configurationsco ce and py5 fig 4b in configurationce the absence of obstacles in the central area enables a strong flow crossing this area diagonally from inletsa and b towards outlet2 the computational model succeeds in capturing this change in the partition of the outflow discharge but it tends to slightly overestimate the measured discharge increase at outlet2 and decrease at outlet 3 figure s3 the difference between computed and observed portions of outflow discharge reaches 4 pp overall for most urban configurations the differences between the numerical predictions and the experimental observations do not exceed the experimental accuracy both for the flow depths at the street inlets and for the discharge partition between the street outlets only in configuration ce the difference between the computed and observed portions of outflow discharge reaches up to 4 pp which is higher than the experimental uncertainty this aspect is further discussed below based on the velocity fields 3 2 flow velocity fig 5 shows the measured surface velocity the computed depth averaged velocity as well as the difference between these two quantities the difference is normalized by a reference velocity 0 2 m s defined as the velocity which would be observed at the street outlets if the outflow discharge was distributed evenly between the three outlets since the observed and computed quantities do not correspond to the same flow variable surface vs depth averaged velocity there is no reason to expect a perfect agreement between the two indeed 3d flow structures downstream of street intersections are known to induce deviations between surface and depth averaged velocities li and zeng 2010 mignot et al 2013 nonetheless a high degree of dis similarity between the two quantities may hint at a low high overall level of confidence in the numerical predictions and may help with interpreting the dis agreement between observed and computed flow depths at street inlets and flow partition at street outlets in general the patterns of computed depth averaged velocity are found very similar to the patterns of observed surface velocity fig 5 in particular in the inlet sections the difference between the two does not exceed 5 i e 0 01 m s this may be considered as a partial validation of the accuracy of our lspiv technique similarly the computed depth averaged velocities and the observed surface velocities in the contraction zones immediately downstream of the street intersections are also very close this is shown in figure s9 in supplement which displays the cross sectional velocity profiles at x 0 8 m and x 1 m corresponding to the contraction zone for street b3 fig 1 further downstream i e for x 1 4 m the differences between the velocity profiles tend to grow suggesting that the recirculation lengths in the measured surface velocity and the computed depth averaged velocity differ downstream of the contraction zones the computed flow shows a more concentrated wall jet than in the observations leading to local differences between computations and observations of the order of 30 of the reference velocity fig 5 and figure s9 in supplement it is possible that such differences stem from the different physical natures of the observed and computed flow variables i e difference between surface and depth averaged velocities downstream of street intersection el kadi abderrezzak et al 2011 el kadi abderrezzak and paquier 2009 li and zeng 2010 mignot et al 2013 among others luo et al 2018 and li and zeng 2010 found a larger flow velocity close to the bottom than at the surface downstream of crossroads which is consistent with a higher depth averaged velocity than the surface velocity as obtained here the cumulative distribution function cdf of the differences between computed depth averaged velocity and observed surface velocity is displayed in fig 6 for configurations co ref and py5 the magnitude of the difference between the two quantities is in the range 10 10 over 60 of the flow domain and in the range 30 30 over 90 of the flow domain in configurations px5 and ce the cdf reveals stronger deviations as shown in fig 5 for configuration px5 the shape of the jet in the central part of the block differs between the observations and the computations in the former case the jet reattaches first against the obstacles located in the southern part of the central area and at mid length it reattaches to the obstacles located in the northern part in contrast in the simulations the jet remains reattached to the southern obstacles we consider as unlikely that this difference results from an actual deviation between depth averaged and surface velocities but it hints more likely at a limitation of the 2d computational model for configuration ce the jet in the observed surface velocity field shows more dispersion than in the computations and the observed large recirculation is more active in the observations than in the computations fig 5c the higher simulated velocity field close to outlet 2 is consistent with the overestimation of the outflow discharge at outlet 2 fig 4b again these differences are more likely to point at a limitation of the 2d model when applied to a wide open area than to reflect a real deviation between surface and depth averaged velocity fields 3 3 flow in the minor streets fig 7 provides a close look at the measured and computed flow fields in the minor streets for configurations ref px5 and py5 empty arrows in fig 7 indicate the direction of net exchange between the minor and main streets for the experiments we determined this direction based on the visualization of the tracers motion in the recorded videos the net flow exchange direction of numerical results is determined with the sign positive negative of exchange discharges see details in figure s12 in supplement in most cases the net exchange flow direction and the pattern of flow recirculation agree between the computations and the observations substantial differences occur in two cases i minor streets in which the net flow exchange is very small and therefore difficult to detect based on the tracers motion and ii in configurationpx5 for which the main jet trajectory is inaccurately represented in the computations as a consequence the rotation of small recirculations in the eastern minor streets is reversed in the numerical predictions compared to the observations overall computed depth averaged velocity and observed surface velocity are very similar particularly in the inlet sections as well as in the vena contracta in contrast downstream of contraction zones the computed jet remains more concentrated at the sidewall than in the observations also in two configurations px5 and ce the trajectories of jets are not accurately captured by the computations in the next section we present a systematic assessment of the influence of urban forms on flow variables while keeping in mind the possible limitations of the computational model 4 results based on computations we detail here the influence of urban forms on the upstream flow depths the discharge partition at the outlets and the exchange discharge between the central area and the adjacent main streets the upstream flow depths and discharge partition at the outlets were selected for their ability to unveil upstream downstream impacts of a particular urban form indeed the flow depths at the inlets reflect the influence of the tested urban forms on the severity of flooding further upstream while the discharge partition indicates how the tested urban forms may affect the distribution of flooding hazard further downstream finally the magnitude of the exchange discharge between the central area and the main streets reveals information on the local flow processes within the considered urban block note that figure s10 in supplement displays the computed velocity fields for all tested configurations 4 1 upstream flow depths and discharge partition for all tested configurations fig 8 shows the variation of the inlet flow depths and outlet discharge partitions compared to the results obtained in the reference configuration 4 δ h i h i h ref h ref and δ q r i q r i q r r e f where subscript i refers to a particular urban form subscript ref refers to the reference configuration h denotes the flow depth at a particular street inlet a b or c and qr the fraction of the total outflow discharge which is drained by a particular outlet 1 2 or 3 overall fig 8a reveals that varying the urban forms does not change significantly the upstream flow depths max 1 this results from the relatively low froude number considered here in contrast the discharge partition at the street outlets is more sensitive to changes in the urban form particularly at outlet 2 where it may vary by up to 6 pp compared to the reference configuration fig 8b 4 1 1 effect of varying the number of minor streets when the number nx of minor streets along x is varied from 1 to 4 the conveyance porosities ψx and ψy being kept constant the outflow discharge at outlet 2 decreases monotonously and vice versa at outlet 1 this reflects a higher flow resistance across the urban form along the x direction as nx is increased hence impeding the transfer of water from west to east towards outlet2 this is consistent with an increase in flow resistance when a flow path of a given total width becomes fragmented into several narrower paths leading to a larger total wetted perimeter for the same total cross sectional area ψx being constant the results obtained with the highest number of minor streets nx4 are close to those of the extreme case co which involves an impermeable central area fig 8b when the number ny of minor streets along direction y is varied the partition of the outflow discharge is barely affected indeed flow recirculations occupy a large portion of those minor streets as depicted in fig 5 and fig 7 hence irrespective of their number the minor streets along y tend not to convey a significant amount of flow for all tested configurations except ce fig 5 also shows a considerable flow momentum in the main street linking inlet b to outlet 3 this tends to impede the deviation of water towards the minor streets aligned along direction y chen et al 2018 showcased a similar effect in a synthetic network of streets where the main streets were shown to act as flow separators inhibiting flow exchanges with minor streets on their sides the anisotropic geometry and boundary conditions considered here lead to a greater transfer of water from west to east than from north to south and thus contrasting influences of nx and ny the anisotropy of the setup is also the reason why the results of configurations co and ce which appear as two extremes from a geometrical perspective do not provide an envelope of the results obtained with the other configurations in fig 8b 4 1 2 effect of varying the conveyance porosities when the conveyance porosity ψx is varied the partition of the outflow discharge is strongly modified see configurations px0 to px5 in fig 8b the range of the variation reaches up to 8 pp at outlet 2 which corresponds to an increase by one third of the outflow discharge at this outlet when ψx is varied from 0 px0 to 0 63 px5 conversely the outflow at outlet 1 is reduced by 7 pp for the same change in ψx as for nx modifying ψx influences directly the resistance to the dominating flow transfer i e along the west east direction this transfer increases as ψx increases in contrast changes in the conveyance porosity ψy py1 to py5 have a milder influence on the outflow discharge partition the ranges of variation are 3 to 5 times smaller than in the case of variations in ψx with an opposite tendency west east transfers decrease as ψy increases 4 1 3 comparison with experimental results fig 8 also displays the experimental results for the configurations tested in the lab ce co ref px5 and py5 the variations in flow depths at the inlets show some disagreements between the computations and the observations e g for configurations co px5 and py5 but these effects lie all in the range of uncertainty of the experimental observations for the outflow discharges the computations and the observations lead in all cases to the same direction of change with regards to the reference in configuration co the predicted and measured values of the change at all street outlets are even in perfect agreement as shown by the corresponding symbols being perfectly aligned in fig 8b for configurations px5 and py5 some differences are observed between experimental and numerical results but they fall all in the range of the experimental uncertainties 1 to 2 pp 4 2 exchange discharge with the central area in addition to the flow depth at the street inlets and the discharge partition at the street outlets we also examined the exchange discharges qe between the main streets and the central area that contains the minor streets normalized by the total inflow discharge this quantity represents the portion of the inflow discharge that is conveyed through the minor streets it enables assessing the contribution of the central area to the overall flow conveyance depending on the urban form to evaluate the exchange discharge qe we summed up the integrals over the street width of the computed depth averaged velocity profiles at each inlet of a minor street considering only those with flow entering the central area qe in or only those with flow leaving the central area qe out owing to mass conservation qe in qe out qe details of the computation are given in figure s12 in supplement unfortunately the experiments do not give access to this information since the observed surface velocity field is not sufficient to precisely infer the flow discharge in each street for each urban configuration involving minor streets fig 9 shows the inlet and outlet exchange discharges qe in and qe out and it highlights the contribution of each face west north east south of the central area to the total exchange discharge qe in or qe out in all configurations except those in the group px qe varies in a very narrow range between 8 and 11 of the total inflow discharge in contrast when the conveyance porosity ψx increases the exchange discharge increases dramatically by up to two orders of magnitude in configuration px0 qe represents 0 2 of the total inflow discharge while it reaches 18 of the inflow discharge in configurationpx5 ψx 0 63 this result explains to a great extent why the partition of outflow discharge is far more influenced by ψx than it is by the three other parameters nx ny and ψy irrespective of the urban configuration water flowing through the central area enters mainly through the west face fig 9a it flows towards the east face and to a lesser extent towards the south and north faces fig 9b the partition of the exchange discharge qe out between these three faces is strongly dependent on the urban configuration except for the group ny while qe increases monotonously when the conveyance porosity ψx increases the evolution of qe with the other parameters nx ny and ψy is slightly non monotonous due to several mechanisms when the number of minor street nx increases the portion of the exchange flow entering the west face remains virtually constant while the portion entering the east face evolves non monotonously leading to a non monotonous evolution of the total exchange discharge moreover when nx is increased above2 the discharge leaving the central area through the east face decreases indicating a higher resistance faced by the flow passing through the urban form from west to east this is consistent with the variation of the discharge partition with nx when ψy is varied from 0 08 to 0 47 the exchange discharges through the north and south faces are hardly modified fig 9b since the minor streets aligned along y axis are mostly occupied by large flow recirculations fig 10 the computed flow fields in the minor streets are presented in figure s17 in supplement for all the configurations 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with bruwier et al 2018 although the building coverage or storage porosity of an urban district is certainly an important characteristic of urban forms bruwier et al 2018 emphasized the stronger influence of the district scale conveyance porosity compared to the storage porosity on the examined flow variables particularly the upstream flow depths in the case of long duration riverine flooding or runoff from upstream catchment the present results are in agreement with bruwier et al 2018 conclusions in particular the storage porosity ϕ indicated in the last column of table 2 alone does not enable predicting the direction nor the magnitude of the trends in the flow variables of interest as demonstrated in fig 11 hence although the building coverage as used also by dong et al 2021 appears as a correct predictor of flow variables when the source of water is the rain falling over the considered urban area löwe et al 2017 bruwier et al 2020 this parameter is not suitable when the water originates from riverine flooding or runoff volumes drained from further upstream of the considered urban area our results point out the contrasting influence of the conveyance porosities ψx and ψy the former affects directly the direction in which the strongest flow transfer occurs so that it has a considerably stronger effect on the flow variables particularly the partition of the outflow discharge fig 8b this aspect could be highlighted here because our setup is non isotropic in the sense that the overall flow transfer along the north south direction differs from the transfer in the west east direction in contrast bruwier et al 2018 were unable to draw attention to these directional effects since their setup was isotropic as regards the boundary conditions and the outer geometry of the tested urban forms another key point of bruwier et al 2018 work was that more fragmented urban forms i e shorter street length and larger building side back tend to reduce the flooding severity upstream of the considered urban area however it was not clear whether the concept of fragmentation refers to a number of voids such as our parameters nx and ny or the actual portion of a cross sectional available for flow conveyance similarly to ψx and ψy indeed bruwier et al 2018 did not analyze the influence of modifying the number of streets while keeping the conveyance porosity constant their urban forms were generated randomly so that several parameters varied simultaneously in contrast based on our systematic approach we have been able to disentangle the overwhelming influence of the conveyance porosity compared to that of the number of streets in a particular direction fig 8 5 2 effect of bottom and sidewall roughness similarly to li et al 2020 all computational results presented in section 4 were obtained by considering smooth bottom and side walls the roughness height was assumed equal to ks 5 10 5 m to assess the influence of this assumption on the results a series of computations was repeated with a considerably larger value for the roughness height ks 10 3 m considering a vertical scale factor ev 5 section 2 4 this value of ks corresponds to 5 mm at the prototype scale which is a plausible value for typical material encountered in real world urban districts these additional computations were carried out for configurations px1 ref px2 px3 px4 and px5 which lead to the strongest variations in the flow characteristics the flow depths computed with ks 10 3 m are systematically higher than those computed with ks 5 10 5 but the differences do not exceed 0 5 mm figure s22a similarly the differences in the discharge partition for both roughness values are very small below 1p p figure s22b besides the variation of these two flow characteristics with the urban form fig 12 a b remains consistent with those obtained for the lower value of roughness fig 8a b finally the roughness doesn t seem to have any substantial influence on the exchange discharge qe nor on its directional distribution as can be inferred by comparing fig 12c d with fig 9 this enables concluding that the findings presented in section 4 are not altered when the value of the roughness height is varied 5 3 extrapolation to the prototype scale additional computations were performed to evaluate the validity of extrapolating to the real world the findings obtained based on a reduced scale model of urban flooding when setting these computations both the district geometry and the hydraulic boundary conditions were upscaled to the prototype scale in line with section 2 4 the focus was set on the series of configurations px1 ref px2 px3 px4 px5 which shows the highest influence on the flow characteristics fig 8 and fig 9 a roughness height ks 0 005 m was assumed as shown in figure s18 in supplement the results remain very similar between the computations conducted for the reduced scale model and those at prototype scale both the flow depths at the inlets and the discharge partitions at the outlets are consistent irrespective of the scale at all inlets and outlets the direction of change of these flow variables with ψx is not altered and although not identical the magnitudes of the variations are also similar at both scales e g 1p p difference in terms of discharge partition the same observations apply for the exchange discharges qe in and qe out in the five tested configurations figure s19 although the flow direction is reversed in some of the minor streets but this corresponds to tiny contributions to the total exchange discharge figure s20 at prototype scale for all values of ψx the flow enters the central area through the north and west sides and leaves this area through the south and east sides figure s21 whereas at the reduced scale the flow direction in some of the minor streets varies with ψx this difference results from the change in the flow aspect ratio between the reduced scale model and the prototype scale but it does not undermine the conclusions of the present study since the discharge flowing through these minor streets contributes little to the overall exchange flow 5 4 limitations of the study this study contains some limitations first only a part of a synthetic street network was analyzed together with a limited number of urban forms although the considered geometry was selected so that it includes a variety of crossroad types and building patterns it is certainly not representative of all settings possibly encountered in real world urban fabrics this may limit the extrapolations of our findings to other practical situations conversely the selected geometry together with the hydraulic boundary conditions has the merit of highlighting the non isotropic behavior of asymmetrical urban districts another limitation stems from the fixed hydraulic boundary conditions considered throughout the study as detailed in section 2 2 it was chosen representative of typical long duration flooding conditions in floodplains of lowland rivers nonetheless we believe that most conclusions would remain unchanged if the hydraulic boundary conditions were varied particularly the ranking of the urban forms in terms of their influence on the flow variables for instance increasing the inflow discharge would mainly magnify the magnitude of the influence of the urban characteristics on the flow variables but it would certainly not reverse the trends this effect was shown by arrault et al 2016 based on a laboratory model of an urban district in which the inflow discharge was varied over one order of magnitude the scaling chosen for the laboratory experiments involving a geometric distortion of 10 section 2 4 could also be questioned note that compared to the case of a geometrically undistorted model the geometric distortion enables obtaining a reynolds number in the laboratory model closer to that at prototype scale at the expense of altering the aspect ratio of the flow sections it also reduces the relative importance of measurement uncertainties li et al 2020 quantified the effects of varying the geometric distortion for the case of configuration co fig 13 a b here we repeated a similar analysis for the reference configuration ref while the laboratory observations used in section 3 were all based on a geometric distortion of 10 we repeated the measurements and computations with six other values of d ranging between 1 6 and 12 5 fig 13c d in both configurations co and ref the results are barely affected by the distortion ratio provided that this ratio remains above 5 only for d 5 a substantial influence of d is observed due to a magnified effect of flow resistance as the geometric distortion and hence the flow depths are reduced this leads to variations by up to 5 of the inlet flow depths and by 10 pp of the outlet discharge moreover the computational model captures reliably the influence of geometric distortion on the results irrespective of the particular urban configuration co or ref 6 conclusion based on experimental and computational modelling we analyzed how flow variables flow depths discharge partition and velocity field in urban flooding are influenced by a particular set of urban forms the considered urban forms consist of a regular network of orthogonal streets they are characterized by four parameters which were systematically varied the most striking result of the study is the overwhelming influence of just a single parameter the conveyance porosity along the direction of dominating flow compared to the three others conveyance porosity in the normal direction as well as the numbers of streets along each direction this result stems from the anisotropy of the considered geometric and hydraulic setting in which water transfer along one direction west east is roughly four times stronger than along the normal direction north south this effect was not revealed in similar recent studies e g bruwier et al 2018 which considered more isotropic geometric and hydraulic boundary conditions it suggests also that in the tested configurations the building coverage or building density which is isotropic is not a suitable predictor of the effect of urbanization on flooding from a practical perspective this finding suggests that when a preferential flow direction can be identified new developments altering the conveyance porosity along this direction should be scrutinized with great care this effect should act as a constraint in the design of new developments in floodplains vice versa the limited influence of the conveyance porosity and the number of streets along the direction normal to the main flow offer an opportunity for new developments which do not increase flooding severity and may safely be constructed provided they are flood proof themselves moreover the relatively high conveyance porosity along the main flow direction should be ensured based on a limited number of flow paths e g few wide streets and not multiple narrower streets as our analyses highlight that fragmenting a flow path into several ones by increasing nx increases the flow resistance detailed comparisons between laboratory observations and computational results are another key outcome of the present study it reveals the ability of a 2d computational model to capture the most typical flow features of urban flooding in a street network in contrast more substantial deviations were pointed out between computations and observations in configurations ce and px5 which involve an open area for engineering practitioners this result hints at the need for a critical assessment of computational predictions when open areas such as large squares are modelled in 2d furthermore the experimental dataset collected here may prove valuable for the validation of other urban flood models such as porosity models ferrari et al 2019 varra et al 2019 ferrari and viero 2020 in a broad range of urban settings although the geometry and hydraulic boundary conditions considered here were selected to represent a variety of urban flooding conditions e g various crossroads with three or four branches while remaining sufficiently generic they are certainly not representative of all urbanistic configurations which may arise in real world urban areas dottori et al 2013 therefore the present study should be complemented by the analysis of many more urban configurations and hydraulic scenarios by means of a stochastic framework as well as the study of real world cases and data e g paquier et al 2020 including steeper terrain slopes and shorter flooding durations el kadi abderrezzak et al 2009 similarly further research is needed on the interplay between urban design and other flow controlling factors in urban flooding such as surcharging urban drainage martins et al 2018 rubinato et al 2018 beg et al 2020 flow intrusion into buildings mignot et al 2020 green infrastructures rosenberger et al 2021 the relative importance of these processes should be examined not only in light of the flow characteristics but also in terms of induced damage dottori et al 2016 molinari et al 2020 finally novel methods such as 3d virtual environments

3909,this study investigates the influence of biochar amendment on the water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat of compacted soils focusing on its potential application in bioengineered structures physical properties water retention characteristics and kunsat of two different soils such as silty sand and pure sand and amended with 5 and 10 w w biochar made from mesquite

biochar contributed to the improved water retention while the altered pore size distribution and porosity of the soils due to biochar amendment increased the tortuosity of the water flow path and hence reduced the kunsat based on the findings biochar amended soil is proposed to be used in bioengineered structures that could promote the growth of vegetation and improve the performance keywords

arid and semi arid regions severely affects the growth and development of crop and non crop species agaba et al 2010 saha et al 2020 the lower water retention in soil excess surface runoff and improper management of water resources lead to the drought stress condition in soil the amendment of soil with additives or the addition of soil conditioner is considered to be as one of the best management practices by the researchers as it can improve water retention water infiltration and drainage aeration and pore structure of the soil hargreaves et al 2008 bhattacharyya et al 2012 liu et al 2013 abbas et al 2018 however the amendment of biochar in soil gained popularity over other amendments lime fiber cement etc due to its environmentally friendliness in terms of carbon sequestration resistance to microbial degradation trapping environmental pollutant e g antibiotics heavy metals and many other beneficial aspects sohi 2012 iqbal et al 2015 lim et al 2016 hussain et al 2020b yang et al 2020 bioengineered structures such as landfill cover bioengineered slopes and embankment green roof etc are comprised of soil and vegetation where vegetation provides an additional stability to the structures hussain et al 2020a comparatively the construction of bioengineered structures preferably in the arid and semi arid region could be subjected to drought stress that in turn could affect the growth and development of the vegetation in addition soil in these structures is often compacted for achieving structural stability and subjects to prolong drying due to low irrigation frequency gco 2000 garg et al 2015 conversely biochar as soil amendment in these structures could manage the effect of drought since the soil in an arid or semi arid region mostly remains in partially saturated or unsaturated condition the soil water retention characteristics or curve swrc and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat could better represent the water stress or drought stress in soil hence it is important to study the effect of biochar on the properties of partially saturated soils especially swrc and kunsat the influence of biochar on the swrc of relatively loose agricultural soil was extensively investigated by the past researchers abel et al 2013 lei and zhang 2013 moragues saitua et al 2017 paetsch et al 2018 while a few studies were also reported for the swrc of compacted biochar amended soil wong et al 2017 bordoloi et al 2018 ni et al 2018 however the effect of biochar on the kunsat of soil was rarely reported the amendment of biochar in coarse grained soil could improve the water retention busscher et al 2010 basso et al 2013 while it may or may not influence the water retention of fine grained soil lei and zhang 2013 wong et al 2017 suliman et al 2017 reported an increased water retention of sandy soil amended with 2 w w biochar produced from pine wood poplar wood and pine bark and pyrolysed at 350 c and 600 c chen et al 2018 reported higher water retention of sandy soil amended with wheat straw biochar whereas major et al 2012 mentioned no significant change in the water retention of clayey soil after biochar amendment wanniarachchi et al 2019 reported a decrease of kunsat in loose agricultural loam sand due to biochar amendment villagra mendoza and horn 2018 mentioned an increased kunsat in sand and no change in silty loam soil after biochar amendment when the kunsat was measured for a lower 50 kpa suction range as the soil in bioengineered structures is compacted compared to loose agricultural soil for achieving structural stability and subjected to large suction due to prolong drying the effects of biochar on kunsat and water retention of compacted soil need to be investigated for potential application in bioengineered structures the kunsat is represented by soil hydraulic conductivity function shcf which is the relationship between soil hydraulic conductivity and soil suction or water content leung et al 2016 the shcf could be directly measured by the instantaneous profile method ipm watson 1966 the ipm is a typical transient state testing method which measures shcf close to that obtained by a steady state method however in a relatively shorter test duration fredlund et al 2012 the technique is based on the mass continuity to evaluate the instantaneous profiles of water flow rate and hydraulic head under an assumed one dimensional 1d water flow condition watson 1966 meerdink et al 1996 measured the shcf of silty clay and red clay by applying the ipm similarly ng and leung 2012 measured shcf of compacted silty clay by employing ipm in a stress controlled soil column apparatus however in these studies bare soil i e soil without biochar amendment was considered the objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of biochar on the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics of compacted soils for potential application in bioengineered structures soil columns were prepared by compacting soil amended with 5 and 10 w w biochar and produced from mesquite at 500 c for monitoring the matric suction and volumetric water content profiles 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar biochar for the present study was produced by the greenfield eco pvt ltd the feedstock of hardwood of mesquite prosopis juliflora was pyrolysed at 500 c for a period of 45 min mesquite is a fast growing invasive weed and abundantly available for pyrolysis the biochar obtained from the vendor had larger size particles that were crushed into smaller size particles using a mechanical grinder the image of the biochar is highlighted in fig 1 the elemental composition of the biochar was determined by combustion technique bird et al 2017 the ash content and the cation exchange capacity cec were measured by ammonium acetate method thomas 1982 and the method described in astm e1755 01 2007 the contact angle of wetting was measured by sessile drop method as described in jeffery et al 2015 the water absorption capacity of the biochar was measured according to the procedure described in hussain et al 2021 the functional groups present in the biochar were identified by the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir test using fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer iraffinity 1 shimadzu japan the ph and electrical conductivity ec of the biochar were determined with a sample to water ratio of 1 10 using an electrode connected to ph meter and electrical conductivity meter jindo et al 2014 the specific surface area ssa of the biochar was determined by a bet surface area analyser autosorb iq mp quantachrome florida according to brunauer et al 1938 surface morphology of the biochar was studied by capturing field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem images magnification 100x to 20kx using a sigma 300 zeiss variable pressure field emission scanning electron microscope operated with 2 10 kv accelerating voltage the intra porosity of the biochar was measured by a conventional helium gas porosimeter as described in pal et al 2018 and hussain et al 2021 the properties of the biochar are presented in table 1 2 2 soil soils for the present study were collected from inside the campus of indian institute of technology iit guwahati and the river bed of brahmaputra river located in the north eastern province of india 26 19 n 91 69 e these are the dominant soils that are used for construction activity in the region dead roots stones gravel and any other impurities in the soils were manually removed thereafter characterised for physicochemical properties such as consistency limits grain size distribution gsd dry density ph ec cec specific gravity and ssa based on the standard procedure prescribed by astm standard astm c128 15 astm d422 63 07 astm d698 12 astm d854 10 d4318 10 astm d4972 18 the images of the soils are presented in fig 1 the properties of the soils are listed in table 2 2 3 test procedure 2 3 1 preparation of soil column the test setup used in the present study is presented in fig 2 a b pvc moulds of size 250 mm diameter and 500 mm length with base plate were fabricated for preparing compacted soil column although the soil hydraulic properties are scale dependent the mould dimension was selected to maintain one dimensional flow conditions six numbers of holes were drilled in the diagonal direction of the mould at a depth of 150 250 and 350 mm from the base of the mould for accommodating suction and moisture content sensors holes were also drilled to allow water to flow in and excess water to flow out for biochar amended soil the soil and biochar at 5 and 10 w w were dry mixed in an aluminium pan the 5 and 10 w w were corresponded to 12 and 25 for silty sand and 17 and 35 for pure sand by volume thereafter water corresponds to 90 of the maximum dry density 0 9mdd obtained from the standard proctor test compaction curve was added mixed uniformly and incubated for a period of 24 h by sealing inside a desiccator for moisture equilibration standard proctor test is a dynamic test where samples are compacted in three equal layers in a standard steel mould of volume 1000 cm3 under the impact 25 times per layer of a hammer of weight 2 5 kg and free fall of 30 cm the dynamic compaction proctor of biochar amended soil caused the crushing of biochar particles made up of softwood le et al 2020 however static compaction and biochar produced from hardwood present study have lesser chance of particles crushing the mixture was then statically compacted at a dry density equal to 0 9mdd in three layers up to a height of 410 mm from the base of the mould using soil compression testing machine aimil india and applying a vertical force of 47 50 kn for pure sand the mixture was statically compacted at a dry density equal to 0 9mdd obtained from the relative density test before compacting the soil columns a drainage layer of 50 mm thick with gravel was placed at the bottom of the mould for uniform distribution of water entering into the soil the selection of compaction density of 0 9mdd and the corresponding water content was based on the compaction criteria adopted for many geotechnical and geo environmental structures reported in the literature gco 2000 li et al 2016 amendment rates of 5 and 10 were selected based on the preliminary investigations conducted for the biochar considered beyond 10 the uniformity of the soil biochar mixing was found to be lost due to the accumulation of biochar the sensors for monitoring suction and moisture content were installed while compacting the soil column the sensors are described in the next section below perspex plate 10 mm thick one with perforated holes and another without holes were placed on the top of the compacted soil surface and the mould respectively and the buffer supports were placed in between the plates for minimizing the evaporation of water from the soil and controlling any volume change or swelling of soil during wetting 2 3 2 monitoring of suction moisture content and establishment of soil water retention curve swrc the matric suction ψm was monitored using teros 21 sensors while the volumetric water content θ was monitored using ec 5 volumetric water content sensors meter group inc 2019 usa the ec 5 sensor could measure volumetric water content in the range of 0 to 100 with an error of 3 and the teros 21 sensor could measure the matric suction in the range of 9 to 105 kpa with an error of 10 these sensors were placed at 60 160 and 260 mm from the surface of the compacted soil during compaction of the soil soil biochar mixture as shown in fig 2a however before installation soil specific bare and biochar amended soil calibration for the moisture sensors was performed and the changes found were incorporated in the calculation of moisture content for minimizing any variation or error in reading the selection of spacing of 100 mm between two sensors was based on the influence zone of the moisture sensors which is approx 25 mm radial distance for easy passage of the sensors during installation the holes in the pvc were drilled slightly larger diameter than the lateral dimension of the sensors after installation of the sensors the gaps between the sensor body and the pvc mould were filled with commercially available sealant material anabond glue fig 2b for preventing any possible leakage of water during experimentation in total twelve numbers of columns i e two columns for each treatment of bare 0 5 and 10 biochar amended silty sand and pure sand were tested all the compacted soil columns were placed in a transparent roofed house fig 2b maintained at the atmospheric condition and protected from natural precipitation the average relative humidity and temperature were observed to be 57 5 and 26 1 c for measuring the drying swrc all the soil columns were initially irrigated with water using a controlled head mariotte bottle with a flow rate of 100 ml min until the suction read by the teros 21 sensor reached a minimum value of around 9 kpa minimum range of the sensor or near saturation the water flow was from bottom to upward therefore the minimum suction was reached first by the bottom sensor then the middle and top sensors i e all the three sensors maintained the minimum suction at the start the full saturation was ensured by the repeated appearance of the minimum suction thereafter all the saturated soil columns were undergone continuous drying until the suction reached a nearly constant peak value similarly for wetting swrc all the dried soil columns were subjected to a bottom to up saturation using a controlled head mariotte bottle with a flow rate of 100 ml min until the suction reached a minimum value of around 9 kpa or near saturation the teros 21 and ec 5 sensors were connected to the em 50 data loggers for continuous monitoring of suction and moisture content at an interval of 10 min initially thereafter varied up to 1 h the monitoring was continued for almost seven month the suction and volumetric water content data obtained from the data loggers were plotted and fitted to van genuchten 1980 model by least square method using retc software van genuchten et al 1991 as given below 1 θ 1 1 α h n m θ s θ r θ r where θ m3 m3 is the volumetric water content at any suction α m 1 is the shape parameter of the swrc h m is the suction head n is the shape parameter m 1 1 n is also the shape parameter θs m3 m3 is the saturated volumetric water content and θr m3 m3 is the residual volumetric water content the corresponding fitting parameters with uncertainties were obtained at 95 confidence interval further the suction in the swrc was converted to equivalent pore radius r by using modified kelvin capillary equation fredlund et al 2012 as given below 2 r 0 0146 ψ where r cm is the equivalent pore radius and ψ kpa is the matric suction the plant available water content pawc was calculated from the field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp based on the literature colman 1947 jamison and kroth 1958 cassel and nielsen 1986 the fc is considered as 10 kpa for pure sand and 33 kpa for silty sand the pwp is considered to be 1500 kpa feddes et al 1978 the difference in water content at 1500 kpa and 10 kpa for pure sand or 33 kpa for silty sand is reported as pawc 2 3 3 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat in the present study the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat was derived from 8208 in total numbers of suction and moisture content data points using instantaneous profile method ipm according to the procedure reported by leung et al 2016 arbitrary profiles of the water content and hydraulic head are highlighted in fig 3 the kunsat was estimated with the help of eqs 3 6 as follows 3 k z avg t avg v δ t i z 2 t avg i z 1 t avg 4 i z avg t avg 1 2 h 1 t 1 h 2 t 1 z 1 t 1 z 2 t 1 h 1 t 2 h 2 t 2 z 1 t 2 z 2 t 2 where k z avg t avg is

the change in water volume v1 was calculated as follows 5 v 1 θ 1 t 2 θ 1 t 1 θ 2 t 2 θ 2 t 1 2 d z where θ i e θ1 θ2 θ3 is the volumetric water content in m3 m3 and dz is the spacing between two sensors in m similarly v2 was calculated the hydraulic gradient at any sensor depth i e i1 i2 i3 was calculated as follows 6 i z t avg 1 2 h t 1 z t 1 h t 2 z t 2 finally the kunsat was calculated from eq 3 by putting the values obtained from eqs 5 and 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of the soil and biochar the soils are classified as silty sand sm uscs astm d2487 11 and poorly graded sand uniformity coefficient cu value of 1 35 and coefficient of gradation cc value of 0 87 the biochar exhibited considerably higher carbon c content due to pyrolysis action table 1 fig 1 b shows the shape of the biochar particles angular shape with no or negligible elongated and flaky particles was observed in biochar the silty sand and pure sand had angular and rounded shape particles respectively fig 1 c d presents the fesem images and the ftir spectra of soils and biochar the honeycombed structure of biochar due to presence of intra pores 5 µm is clearly visible from fig 1 c whereas there are no intra pores observed in the soils the intra pores in biochar led to the lower specific gravity and higher ssa and water absorption capacity of the biochar compared to the soils table 1 and table 2 the transmittance peaks obtained from the ftir analysis are highlighted in fig 1 d the broad peaks at web numbers 3433 3472 3445 cm 1 in biochar and the soils are corresponding to the intermolecular or intramolecular hydroxyl oh stretching the hydroxyl oh group forms hydrogen bond and attracts water molecules i e hydrophilicity van der spoel et al 2006 the peak at 2924 cm 1 in the biochar is due to the aliphatic c h bond of alkanes das and sarmah 2015 the peaks at 1384 1270 and 875 cm 1 are attributed to the ch3 alkanes c o stretch carboxylic acid and asymmetric bending of calcite groups angalaeeswari and kamaludeen 2017 whereas the peak at 1594 cm 1 in biochar is attributed to the stretching of aromatic ring c c kumar et al 2019 comparatively peak at 2359 cm 1 in the soils is due to c o symmetric group while peaks at 1634 1636 cm 1 represent the c o stretching guharay et al 2019 the c o is primarily the ionisablecarboxyl groupsand associated with hydrophilicity gray et al 2014 peaks at 1012 911 and 777 cm 1 are confirming the si o quartz stretching and si o bending in the soils gnanasaravanan and rajkumar 2013 3 2 effect of biochar on the physical properties of the soils the atterberg limits specific gravity and the compaction characteristics of the bare and biochar amended soil are presented in table 3 the atterberg limits i e the liquid limit ll plastic limit pl and shrinkage limit sl of the soils were observed to be increased when biochar of 5 and 10 w w was amended the higher relative to soil water absorption capacity of biochar table 1 and table 2 due to presence of intra pores and functional groups increased the water absorption capacity of the soil after amendment suliman et al 2017 nakhli and imhoff 2020 thereby increased the atterberg limits the water absorption capacity is the amount of water absorbed in pores within the material particles with respect to the dry mass of the material when the material is in water submerged condition astm c128 15 the specific gravity of the soils decreased when biochar 5 and 10 was amended table 3 this could be attributed to the replacement of heavy higher specific gravity soil particles with the lighter and porous biochar particles of allowing higher air entrapment reddy et al 2015 further the amendment of 5 to 10 biochar decreased the maximum dry density mdd of the soils while increased the optimum moisture content omc of the silty sand table 3 the lower specific gravity and internal porous structure of biochar increased the porosity and entrapment of air in soil liu et al 2017 after amendment which led to the lower compressibility reddy et al 2015 during compaction and hence reduced dry density conversely the higher water absorption capacity of the biochar table 1 compared to soil table 2 contributed to the increased omc guo et al 2014 fig 4 highlights the gsd curves of the bare and biochar amended silty sand and pure sand the amendment of 5 and 10 biochar in both the soils shifted the gsd curves downward with respect to the bare soil which indicates an increased number of larger size particles in amended soil compared to the bare soil and larger size particles could form larger size inter pores after compaction 3 3 effect of biochar on suction and water content response the variation of suction and volumetric water content of bare and biochar amended silty sand and pure sand with time for the middle row of sensors are presented in fig 5 a h for the sake of brevity the figure of other two rows of sensors i e the bottom and top row of sensors are not presented here further there was no significant change observed between the data of duplicated columns hence the data of single column set was presented which sufficed the purpose of comparison among the biochar treatment i e 0 5 and 10 fig 5 a b and fig 5 e f show the variation of suction with time for bare and biochar amended silty sand and pure sand under drying and wetting condition in drying process a suction of around 9 kpa was observed to be maintained for 150 200 h in fig 5 a and 5 e which ensures the saturated state of the soils thereafter suction increased with time and reached a peak value in the range of 5000 10000 kpa due to evaporation of water from pores by the capillary action in silty sand a longer duration compared to pure sand was taken to reach the peak which could be attributed to the uniform pore size distribution of silty sand formed by the presence of particles of all sizes the uniform pore size distribution of silty sand allowed water to evaporate slowly compared to the non uniform pore size distribution of pure sand leading to a longer duration to reach the peak in a same duration of time the peak suction was observed to be higher in bare soil compared with the biochar amended soils which ensures the higher water evaporation in bare soil and higher water retention in biochar amended soils similarly for a particular duration of time the pure sand both bare and amended showed a higher suction compared with silty sand due to the lower water retention capacity of pure sand in wetting process the suction observed to decrease with time and reached the minimum value of around 9 kpa first in bare soil and then in biochar amended soil fig 5 b and fig 5 f it ensures the higher hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate in bare soil compared to the biochar amended soil in general a suction value of 1500 kpa is considered as permanent wilting point pwp feddes et al 1978 the time required to reach the pwp is termed as the wilting time of the plant under water stress condition saha et al 2020 the amendment of the biochar in soils extend the time prolonged of wilting i e the bare silty sand reached the pwp within 1500 h and the 10 biochar amended silty sand reached that in 3000 h similarly the bare pure sand reached within 180 h while the 10 biochar amended pure sand reached in 210 h thus the biochar amendment slowed down the development of drought stress in soil fig 5 c d and fig 5 g h highlight the variation of volumetric water content θ with time for bare and biochar amended silty sand and pure sand under drying and wetting condition similar to suction profile the θ was observed to be decreased with time in drying process due to evaporation of water while increased in wetting process due to absorption of water further the θ was observed to be higher in biochar amended soil 10 w w compared with the bare soil for both the type of soils and under drying and wetting process which indicates the higher water retention capacity of biochar amended soil compared to the bare soil in wetting process the increase of θ was found to be quicker in bare soil confirming the higher hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate in bare soil compared with the biochar amended soil considering the soil type the decrease of water content in drying and increase in wetting process was observed to be abrupt in pure sand due to the larger pores size and non uniform pore size distribution in pure sand compared with silty sand of showing gradual change 3 4 effect of biochar on swrc fig 6 a f highlights the swrcs of bare and biochar 5 and 10 w w amended silty sand and pure sand under drying and wetting process the fitting parameters of the swrc are presented in table 4 the effect of biochar on swrcs is discussed with respect to the swrc parameters such as saturated water content θs air entry value aev n and residual water content θr that defines the water retention characteristics of the soil and also the pawc which controls the irrigation frequency and drought process it is clear from the data presented in table 4 that the θs of the silty sand and pure sand increased from 35 to 46 and 41 to 50 under drying process and 33 to 43 and 40 to 51 under wetting process respectively after amendment of 10 biochar the magnitude of θs was observed to be higher in pure sand compared to silty sand under both bare and amended state and the rate of increment in θs due to biochar amendment was observed to be higher in silty sand compared to pure sand the amendment of biochar showed no comparable change in the air entry value aev of the soils as a bare minimum difference physically may not be significant between the data of bare and biochar amended soil could be observed from table 4 the change in n due to biochar amendment was observed to be inconsistent in the silty sand while it decreased significantly from 1 76 to 1 34 under drying and 2 01 to 1 42 under wetting process in pure sand after 10 biochar amendment the magnitude of n was observed to be higher in pure sand compared to the silty sand the amendment of biochar increased the residual water content θr of the silty sand from 7 to 16 under drying and 9 to 17 under wetting process similarly the θr increased from 1 to 5 under drying and 2 to 6 under wetting in pure sand respectively among the soil type tested the rate of increment in θr due to biochar amendment was observed to be higher in pure sand the pawc of the silty sand and pure sand was observed to be increased from 9 to 13 and 32 to 35 under drying process and 5 to 8 and 32 to 36 under wetting process after amendment of biochar the biochar driven increase in pawc was found to be higher in silty sand further larger magnitudes of pawc in pure sand compared to silty sand could be seen from table 4 the amendment of biochar increased the total porosity of the soils table 3 the total porosity was theoretically calculated from the measured specific gravity and compaction density of the bare and biochar amended soil the increased porosity of soil due to biochar amendment was also reported by hussain et al 2021 and nakhli et al 2021 total porosity comprised of inter porosity by inter pores and intra porosity by intra pores the higher total porosity in biochar amended soil was attributed to the decreased dry density of the soils after biochar amendment table 3 the dry density of the soils changed with the biochar amendment rate due to which the initial compaction density was different among the soil columns and hence the total porosity the intra pores in biochar fig 1c added the intra porosity 1 8 after amending to soil and increased the soil ssa as it is evident from the higher water absorption capacity of biochar compared to the soils table 1 and table 2 the amendment of biochar increased the numbers of larger sized particles in gsd shifted below fig 4 that have generated larger size or more numbers of inter pores compared to the bare soil after compaction and hence increased the inter porosity table 3 the increased total porosity with larger ssa table 1 and the presence of surface functional groups fig 1d especially oh and c o groups allowed larger quantity of water to be stored and hence the higher θs since porosity is equivalent to the θs the larger magnitude of θs in pure sand compared to the silty sand was attributed to the lower initial compaction density of pure sand under both bare and amended state table 3 which led to the higher total porosity and hence the θs the observed higher improvement in θs of silty sand over pure sand was due to the higher increase of inter porosity by the formation of larger size or more numbers of inter pores in silty sand after biochar amendment table 3 the amendment rates of biochar were maintained same for both the soils ideally the intra porosity should remain same the silty sand consists of considerably higher 49 fines content compared to the pure sand 1 6 and thus have the chance to form larger size inter pores after biochar amendment table 2 the shape parameter n represents the transition zone of the swrc and is basically related to the pore size distribution of the soil the decrease of n after biochar amendment was attributed to the reduced pore size in biochar amended soil compared to the bare soil as in fig 6 for a particular water content in transition zone the pore size in biochar amended soil is smaller flattened curves and in the range of 1 µm 10 µm fig 6 which indicates the direct addition of smaller size intra pores 5 µm fig 1c and the settlement of smaller soil or biochar particles in the inter pores or reformation of inter pores after biochar amendment and thus reduced pores size in biochar amended soil abel et al 2013 andrenelli et al 2016 the larger size inter pores and non uniform pore size distribution of pure sand due to presence of single sized particles relative to the silty sand of all particles size ranges table 2 caused the steeper slope or larger magnitude of n in pure sand compared to the silty sand the amendment of biochar in pure sand decreased the inter pores size i e formed smaller sized inter pores and modified the pore size distribution towards uniformity which led the n to change larger extend in pure sand compared to silty sand of relatively uniform pore size distribution sun and lu 2014 reported an increased total porosity with reorganization of pore size into small and larger sizes in silty clay due to biochar amendment similarly wong et al 2018 mentioned a changed pore size distribution of kaolin clay from dominant 0 05 0 06 μm pores to 0 1 4 μm pores i e the pore size increased due to biochar amendment the parameter n physically represents the desaturation rate under drying and re saturation rate under wetting of soil thus the decreased n value due to biochar amendment could delay the drying and wetting process of the soil the increase of θr in biochar amended soils was attributed to the smaller size residual pores fig 6 which could be inter pores or intra pores that have retained water at larger suction due to their smaller size or diameter however intra pores are the smaller one mostly nanoscale to hold water at large suction the smaller sized pores held water tightly due to strong capillary action fredlund et al 2012 and resisted the water evaporation thus higher water retention the bare pure sand showed lower θr compared to the silty sand table 4 due to their large pores size however the amendment of biochar decreased the pores size higher extend in pure sand compared to the silty sand which led to the higher θr in biochar amended pure sand compared to silty sand i e the efficacy of biochar in improving θr was observed to be higher in pure sand the higher pawc in biochar amended soil indicates the higher stored water for vegetation to readily use during drought state the vegetation has strong influence in bioengineered structures in terms of improving structural stability through root reinforcement and hydrological process hussain et al 2020a the higher quantity of readily available water in soil after biochar amendment would help the plants to survive the drought stress and ultimately maintain the stability the difference was observed in the swrc parameters due to drying and wetting process table 4 clearly the effect of hysteresis could be observed in both the soils with or without biochar amendment fig 6a f the hysteresis loop is observed to be wider in silty sand compared to the pure sand the change in soil structure due to particular rearrangement or ink bottle effects volume change entrapment of air and alteration in wetting characteristics contact angle during drying wetting led to the hysteresis in the swrc fredlund et al 2012 although the swelling of samples during wetting was restrained by the confinement a small volume change due to shrinkage during drying could be possible in silty sand with clay and silt fraction since the samples of silty sand were prepared with an addition of initial moisture content however the shrinkage was expected to be negligible due to the absence of higher swelling clay minerals and the presence of confinement the shrinkage along with the change in pore size distribution due to particular rearrangement by the dying and followed by wetting led to the wider hysteresis loop in silty sand relative to the pure sand in pure sand only particular rearrangement during wetting caused the hysteresis and the absence of shrinkage swelling led to the lower hysteresis effect compared with silty sand thus the increased water retention in biochar amended soil that has been characterised by the fitting parameters could be beneficial for the growth of vegetation in bioengineered structures due to the reduced irrigation demand and reduced effect of drought stress 3 5 effect of biochar on hydraulic conductivity function fig 7 a h highlights the variation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat with suction i e the hydraulic conductivity function for bare and biochar 5 and 10 w w amended silty sand and pure sand under drying and wetting condition the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of bare and biochar amended silty sand and pure sand is also presented in figure for reference the kunsat was observed to be reached the maximum near to ksat at around 9 kpa fig 7 in drying state the kunsat decreased in both the soils with the increase of suction fig 7 a b e f the magnitude of kunsat was recorded as low as 10 12 m sec in the present study however literature meerdink et al 1996 li et al 2009 uzoma et al 2011 reported kunsat value lower than 10 12 m sec the magnitude of kunsat varies soil to soil and depends on the range of suction measured i e at large suction the kunsat could be very low further according to the error propagation rule the error in the measured suction will propagate to the kunsat values as follows 7 u k unsat k unsat u ψ ψ 2 where ukunsat is the uncertainty in the kunsat uψ is the uncertainty in the suction and ψ is the measured suction respectively however the calculation of kunsat is not based on the single ψ measurement i e for a single kunsat value two different ψ values at different points or sensors are used and the effect of which two different ψ can not be assessed from the error propagation rule eq 7 the increase of suction allows more air bubbles to entrap in soil these entrapped air bubbles block the hydraulic flow path thereby increased the tortuosity of water flow paths and decreased the kunsat further the amendment of biochar decreased the kunsat in both the soils under drying and wetting condition and the rate of decrement in kunsat was observed to be higher with the higher biochar amendment rate fig 7 the amendment of the biochar in soils reorganized the pore structure or pore size distribution of the soils by adding smaller size intra pores and possibly reforming smaller size inter pores as observed by sun and lu 2014 for silty clay which led to the increased tortuosity or tortuous flow path and hence reduced kunsat sun et al 2015 and blanco canqui 2017 reported an increased tortuosity in sandy soil after biochar amendment that affects the water flow path the lower kunsat of biochar amended soil compared to the bare soil was also justified from the delayed wetting and drying of biochar amended soil compared to bare soil observed from the suction and volumetric water content responses presented in fig 5 a h a steep change in kunsat with suction could be observed in silty sand fig 7 a d relative to pure sand fig 7 e h under drying and wetting condition that ensures the uniform and smaller pores size in silty sand compared to the pure sand thereby a small change in suction or pore water led to the sharp change in the kunsat differences could be observed in the hydraulic conductivity function of the soils under drying and wetting process i e at any suction the magnitude of kunsat in drying state fig 7 a b e f was always higher than that of the wetting state fig 7 c d g h in addition the effect of hysteresis was observed to be more pronounced in lower suction range compared to the large suction range the lower volumetric water content along the wetting path due to the change in pore structure contact angle and the entrapment of air during drying and wetting process led to the lesser hydraulic flow path and hence the lower kunsat in wetting process the influence of the changed pore structure or capillarity was more strong at lower suction range compared to the large suction that it has caused the higher hysteresis effect at lower suction range hillel 1998 al mahbashi et al 2018 the deviation of wetting path kunsat from the drying path hysteresis was observed to be more in silty sand compared to the pure sand and attributed to the higher change in pore structure due to particular rearrangement in silty sand of containing fines clay and silt the fine grained soil generally undergoes higher structural changes or particular rearrangement due to their mineralic action al mahbashi et al 2018 considering the soil type tested the pure sand always including drying and wetting process exhibited a higher hydraulic conductivity kunsat or ksat over silty sand due to their highly porous structure that provides larger passage for water to flow there was no comparable variation observed in kunsat in different location or between three rows of sensors i e k1 and k2 in fig 7a h in a same soil column under either of drying or wetting conditions which ensured the maintenance of uniform soil compaction along the depth 4 conclusions the influence of biochar amendment on the water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of compacted soils for potential application in bioengineered structures was investigated and presented in this study 1 d column study using ipm technique was carried out in compacted silty sand and pure sand amended with 5 and 10 biochar produced from mesquite the following conclusion can be drawn 1 the amendment of biochar changed the physical properties of the soils i e increased the atterberg limits by 6 26 and decreased the specific gravity and dry density by 6 8 and 8 15 the internal porous structure of biochar intra pores caused the change in the soil properties after amendment 2 water retention characterised by the swrc parameters was observed to be increased by on an average 30 150 in both silty sand and pure sand due to the biochar amendment hydraulic hysteresis was observed in water retention of the both bare and biochar amended soils due to drying wetting process the altered pore size distribution and porosity of the soils after biochar amendment and the surface functional groups in biochar contributed to the changed water retention 3 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat of the soils was found to be decreased by on an average one two order of magnitude after biochar amendment and the hysteresis similar to that in water retention was also observed the alteration of pore size distribution of the soils after biochar amendment made the water flow path more tortuous and hence reduced the kunsat the increased water retention and decreased kunsat in biochar amended soils resulting in higher quantity of available water for plants and lower percolation and evaporation loss from soils these potentially would help in the growth of vegetation in bioengineered structures in arid or semi arid region by reducing the effect of drought

3909,this study investigates the influence of biochar amendment on the water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat of compacted soils focusing on its potential application in bioengineered structures physical properties water retention characteristics and kunsat of two different soils such as silty sand and pure sand and amended with 5 and 10 w w biochar made from mesquite were measured with the help of instantaneous profile method ipm the water retention capacity of the biochar amended soil was characterised by plotting soil water retention curve swrc and estimating the saturated volumetric water content θs residual water content θr shape parameter n and plant available water content pawc the results revealed that the amendment of biochar in the soils increased the θs by 20 30 θr 60 370 and pawc 7 60 and decreased the n by 5 18 and kunsat one two order the microstructural observation showed that the hydrophilic surface functional groups and intra pores in biochar contributed to the improved water retention while the altered pore size distribution and porosity of the soils due to biochar amendment increased the tortuosity of the water flow path and hence reduced the kunsat based on the findings biochar amended soil is proposed to be used in bioengineered structures that could promote the growth of vegetation and improve the performance keywords

arid and semi arid regions severely affects the growth and development of crop and non crop species agaba et al 2010 saha et al 2020 the lower water retention in soil excess surface runoff and improper management of water resources lead to the drought stress condition in soil the amendment of soil with additives or the addition of soil conditioner is considered to be as one of the best management practices by the researchers as it can improve water retention water infiltration and drainage aeration and pore structure of the soil hargreaves et al 2008 bhattacharyya et al 2012 liu et al 2013 abbas et al 2018 however the amendment of biochar in soil gained popularity over other amendments lime fiber cement etc due to its environmentally friendliness in terms of carbon sequestration resistance to microbial degradation trapping environmental pollutant e g antibiotics heavy metals and many other beneficial aspects sohi 2012 iqbal et al 2015 lim et al 2016 hussain et al 2020b yang et al 2020 bioengineered structures such as landfill cover bioengineered slopes and embankment green roof etc are comprised of soil and vegetation where vegetation provides an additional stability to the structures hussain et al 2020a comparatively the construction of bioengineered structures preferably in the arid and semi arid region could be subjected to drought stress that in turn could affect the growth and development of the vegetation in addition soil in these structures is often compacted for achieving structural stability and subjects to prolong drying due to low irrigation frequency gco 2000 garg et al 2015 conversely biochar as soil amendment in these structures could manage the effect of drought since the soil in an arid or semi arid region mostly remains in partially saturated or unsaturated condition the soil water retention characteristics or curve swrc and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat could better represent the water stress or drought stress in soil hence it is important to study the effect of biochar on the properties of partially saturated soils especially swrc and kunsat the influence of biochar on the swrc of relatively loose agricultural soil was extensively investigated by the past researchers abel et al 2013 lei and zhang 2013 moragues saitua et al 2017 paetsch et al 2018 while a few studies were also reported for the swrc of compacted biochar amended soil wong et al 2017 bordoloi et al 2018 ni et al 2018 however the effect of biochar on the kunsat of soil was rarely reported the amendment of biochar in coarse grained soil could improve the water retention busscher et al 2010 basso et al 2013 while it may or may not influence the water retention of fine grained soil lei and zhang 2013 wong et al 2017 suliman et al 2017 reported an increased water retention of sandy soil amended with 2 w w biochar produced from pine wood poplar wood and pine bark and pyrolysed at 350 c and 600 c chen et al 2018 reported higher water retention of sandy soil amended with wheat straw biochar whereas major et al 2012 mentioned no significant change in the water retention of clayey soil after biochar amendment wanniarachchi et al 2019 reported a decrease of kunsat in loose agricultural loam sand due to biochar amendment villagra mendoza and horn 2018 mentioned an increased kunsat in sand and no change in silty loam soil after biochar amendment when the kunsat was measured for a lower 50 kpa suction range as the soil in bioengineered structures is compacted compared to loose agricultural soil for achieving structural stability and subjected to large suction due to prolong drying the effects of biochar on kunsat and water retention of compacted soil need to be investigated for potential application in bioengineered structures the kunsat is represented by soil hydraulic conductivity function shcf which is the relationship between soil hydraulic conductivity and soil suction or water content leung et al 2016 the shcf could be directly measured by the instantaneous profile method ipm watson 1966 the ipm is a typical transient state testing method which measures shcf close to that obtained by a steady state method however in a relatively shorter test duration fredlund et al 2012 the technique is based on the mass continuity to evaluate the instantaneous profiles of water flow rate and hydraulic head under an assumed one dimensional 1d water flow condition watson 1966 meerdink et al 1996 measured the shcf of silty clay and red clay by applying the ipm similarly ng and leung 2012 measured shcf of compacted silty clay by employing ipm in a stress controlled soil column apparatus however in these studies bare soil i e soil without biochar amendment was considered the objective of the present study is to investigate the effect of biochar on the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water retention characteristics of compacted soils for potential application in bioengineered structures soil columns were prepared by compacting soil amended with 5 and 10 w w biochar and produced from mesquite at 500 c for monitoring the matric suction and volumetric water content profiles 2 materials and methods 2 1 biochar biochar for the present study was produced by the greenfield eco pvt ltd the feedstock of hardwood of mesquite prosopis juliflora was pyrolysed at 500 c for a period of 45 min mesquite is a fast growing invasive weed and abundantly available for pyrolysis the biochar obtained from the vendor had larger size particles that were crushed into smaller size particles using a mechanical grinder the image of the biochar is highlighted in fig 1 the elemental composition of the biochar was determined by combustion technique bird et al 2017 the ash content and the cation exchange capacity cec were measured by ammonium acetate method thomas 1982 and the method described in astm e1755 01 2007 the contact angle of wetting was measured by sessile drop method as described in jeffery et al 2015 the water absorption capacity of the biochar was measured according to the procedure described in hussain et al 2021 the functional groups present in the biochar were identified by the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir test using fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer iraffinity 1 shimadzu japan the ph and electrical conductivity ec of the biochar were determined with a sample to water ratio of 1 10 using an electrode connected to ph meter and electrical conductivity meter jindo et al 2014 the specific surface area ssa of the biochar was determined by a bet surface area analyser autosorb iq mp quantachrome florida according to brunauer et al 1938 surface morphology of the biochar was studied by capturing field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem images magnification 100x to 20kx using a sigma 300 zeiss variable pressure field emission scanning electron microscope operated with 2 10 kv accelerating voltage the intra porosity of the biochar was measured by a conventional helium gas porosimeter as described in pal et al 2018 and hussain et al 2021 the properties of the biochar are presented in table 1 2 2 soil soils for the present study were collected from inside the campus of indian institute of technology iit guwahati and the river bed of brahmaputra river located in the north eastern province of india 26 19 n 91 69 e these are the dominant soils that are used for construction activity in the region dead roots stones gravel and any other impurities in the soils were manually removed thereafter characterised for physicochemical properties such as consistency limits grain size distribution gsd dry density ph ec cec specific gravity and ssa based on the standard procedure prescribed by astm standard astm c128 15 astm d422 63 07 astm d698 12 astm d854 10 d4318 10 astm d4972 18 the images of the soils are presented in fig 1 the properties of the soils are listed in table 2 2 3 test procedure 2 3 1 preparation of soil column the test setup used in the present study is presented in fig 2 a b pvc moulds of size 250 mm diameter and 500 mm length with base plate were fabricated for preparing compacted soil column although the soil hydraulic properties are scale dependent the mould dimension was selected to maintain one dimensional flow conditions six numbers of holes were drilled in the diagonal direction of the mould at a depth of 150 250 and 350 mm from the base of the mould for accommodating suction and moisture content sensors holes were also drilled to allow water to flow in and excess water to flow out for biochar amended soil the soil and biochar at 5 and 10 w w were dry mixed in an aluminium pan the 5 and 10 w w were corresponded to 12 and 25 for silty sand and 17 and 35 for pure sand by volume thereafter water corresponds to 90 of the maximum dry density 0 9mdd obtained from the standard proctor test compaction curve was added mixed uniformly and incubated for a period of 24 h by sealing inside a desiccator for moisture equilibration standard proctor test is a dynamic test where samples are compacted in three equal layers in a standard steel mould of volume 1000 cm3 under the impact 25 times per layer of a hammer of weight 2 5 kg and free fall of 30 cm the dynamic compaction proctor of biochar amended soil caused the crushing of biochar particles made up of softwood le et al 2020 however static compaction and biochar produced from hardwood present study have lesser chance of particles crushing the mixture was then statically compacted at a dry density equal to 0 9mdd in three layers up to a height of 410 mm from the base of the mould using soil compression testing machine aimil india and applying a vertical force of 47 50 kn for pure sand the mixture was statically compacted at a dry density equal to 0 9mdd obtained from the relative density test before compacting the soil columns a drainage layer of 50 mm thick with gravel was placed at the bottom of the mould for uniform distribution of water entering into the soil the selection of compaction density of 0 9mdd and the corresponding water content was based on the compaction criteria adopted for many geotechnical and geo environmental structures reported in the literature gco 2000 li et al 2016 amendment rates of 5 and 10 were selected based on the preliminary investigations conducted for the biochar considered beyond 10 the uniformity of the soil biochar mixing was found to be lost due to the accumulation of biochar the sensors for monitoring suction and moisture content were installed while compacting the soil column the sensors are described in the next section below perspex plate 10 mm thick one with perforated holes and another without holes were placed on the top of the compacted soil surface and the mould respectively and the buffer supports were placed in between the plates for minimizing the evaporation of water from the soil and controlling any volume change or swelling of soil during wetting 2 3 2 monitoring of suction moisture content and establishment of soil water retention curve swrc the matric suction ψm was monitored using teros 21 sensors while the volumetric water content θ was monitored using ec 5 volumetric water content sensors meter group inc 2019 usa the ec 5 sensor could measure volumetric water content in the range of 0 to 100 with an error of 3 and the teros 21 sensor could measure the matric suction in the range of 9 to 105 kpa with an error of 10 these sensors were placed at 60 160 and 260 mm from the surface of the compacted soil during compaction of the soil soil biochar mixture as shown in fig 2a however before installation soil specific bare and biochar amended soil calibration for the moisture sensors was performed and the changes found were incorporated in the calculation of moisture content for minimizing any variation or error in reading the selection of spacing of 100 mm between two sensors was based on the influence zone of the moisture sensors which is approx 25 mm radial distance for easy passage of the sensors during installation the holes in the pvc were drilled slightly larger diameter than the lateral dimension of the sensors after installation of the sensors the gaps between the sensor body and the pvc mould were filled with commercially available sealant material anabond glue fig 2b for preventing any possible leakage of water during experimentation in total twelve numbers of columns i e two columns for each treatment of bare 0 5 and 10 biochar amended silty sand and pure sand were tested all the compacted soil columns were placed in a transparent roofed house fig 2b maintained at the atmospheric condition and protected from natural precipitation the average relative humidity and temperature were observed to be 57 5 and 26 1 c for measuring the drying swrc all the soil columns were initially irrigated with water using a controlled head mariotte bottle with a flow rate of 100 ml min until the suction read by the teros 21 sensor reached a minimum value of around 9 kpa minimum range of the sensor or near saturation the water flow was from bottom to upward therefore the minimum suction was reached first by the bottom sensor then the middle and top sensors i e all the three sensors maintained the minimum suction at the start the full saturation was ensured by the repeated appearance of the minimum suction thereafter all the saturated soil columns were undergone continuous drying until the suction reached a nearly constant peak value similarly for wetting swrc all the dried soil columns were subjected to a bottom to up saturation using a controlled head mariotte bottle with a flow rate of 100 ml min until the suction reached a minimum value of around 9 kpa or near saturation the teros 21 and ec 5 sensors were connected to the em 50 data loggers for continuous monitoring of suction and moisture content at an interval of 10 min initially thereafter varied up to 1 h the monitoring was continued for almost seven month the suction and volumetric water content data obtained from the data loggers were plotted and fitted to van genuchten 1980 model by least square method using retc software van genuchten et al 1991 as given below 1 θ 1 1 α h n m θ s θ r θ r where θ m3 m3 is the volumetric water content at any suction α m 1 is the shape parameter of the swrc h m is the suction head n is the shape parameter m 1 1 n is also the shape parameter θs m3 m3 is the saturated volumetric water content and θr m3 m3 is the residual volumetric water content the corresponding fitting parameters with uncertainties were obtained at 95 confidence interval further the suction in the swrc was converted to equivalent pore radius r by using modified kelvin capillary equation fredlund et al 2012 as given below 2 r 0 0146 ψ where r cm is the equivalent pore radius and ψ kpa is the matric suction the plant available water content pawc was calculated from the field capacity fc and permanent wilting point pwp based on the literature colman 1947 jamison and kroth 1958 cassel and nielsen 1986 the fc is considered as 10 kpa for pure sand and 33 kpa for silty sand the pwp is considered to be 1500 kpa feddes et al 1978 the difference in water content at 1500 kpa and 10 kpa for pure sand or 33 kpa for silty sand is reported as pawc 2 3 3 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat in the present study the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat was derived from 8208 in total numbers of suction and moisture content data points using instantaneous profile method ipm according to the procedure reported by leung et al 2016 arbitrary profiles of the water content and hydraulic head are highlighted in fig 3 the kunsat was estimated with the help of eqs 3 6 as follows 3 k z avg t avg v δ t i z 2 t avg i z 1 t avg 4 i z avg t avg 1 2 h 1 t 1 h 2 t 1 z 1 t 1 z 2 t 1 h 1 t 2 h 2 t 2 z 1 t 2 z 2 t 2 where k z avg t avg is

the change in water volume v1 was calculated as follows 5 v 1 θ 1 t 2 θ 1 t 1 θ 2 t 2 θ 2 t 1 2 d z where θ i e θ1 θ2 θ3 is the volumetric water content in m3 m3 and dz is the spacing between two sensors in m similarly v2 was calculated the hydraulic gradient at any sensor depth i e i1 i2 i3 was calculated as follows 6 i z t avg 1 2 h t 1 z t 1 h t 2 z t 2 finally the kunsat was calculated from eq 3 by putting the values obtained from eqs 5 and 6 3 results and discussion 3 1 properties of the soil and biochar the soils are classified as silty sand sm uscs astm d2487 11 and poorly graded sand uniformity coefficient cu value of 1 35 and coefficient of gradation cc value of 0 87 the biochar exhibited considerably higher carbon c content due to pyrolysis action table 1 fig 1 b shows the shape of the biochar particles angular shape with no or negligible elongated and flaky particles was observed in biochar the silty sand and pure sand had angular and rounded shape particles respectively fig 1 c d presents the fesem images and the ftir spectra of soils and biochar the honeycombed structure of biochar due to presence of intra pores 5 µm is clearly visible from fig 1 c whereas there are no intra pores observed in the soils the intra pores in biochar led to the lower specific gravity and higher ssa and water absorption capacity of the biochar compared to the soils table 1 and table 2 the transmittance peaks obtained from the ftir analysis are highlighted in fig 1 d the broad peaks at web numbers 3433 3472 3445 cm 1 in biochar and the soils are corresponding to the intermolecular or intramolecular hydroxyl oh stretching the hydroxyl oh group forms hydrogen bond and attracts water molecules i e hydrophilicity van der spoel et al 2006 the peak at 2924 cm 1 in the biochar is due to the aliphatic c h bond of alkanes das and sarmah 2015 the peaks at 1384 1270 and 875 cm 1 are attributed to the ch3 alkanes c o stretch carboxylic acid and asymmetric bending of calcite groups angalaeeswari and kamaludeen 2017 whereas the peak at 1594 cm 1 in biochar is attributed to the stretching of aromatic ring c c kumar et al 2019 comparatively peak at 2359 cm 1 in the soils is due to c o symmetric group while peaks at 1634 1636 cm 1 represent the c o stretching guharay et al 2019 the c o is primarily the ionisablecarboxyl groupsand associated with hydrophilicity gray et al 2014 peaks at 1012 911 and 777 cm 1 are confirming the si o quartz stretching and si o bending in the soils gnanasaravanan and rajkumar 2013 3 2 effect of biochar on the physical properties of the soils the atterberg limits specific gravity and the compaction characteristics of the bare and biochar amended soil are presented in table 3 the atterberg limits i e the liquid limit ll plastic limit pl and shrinkage limit sl of the soils were observed to be increased when biochar of 5 and 10 w w was amended the higher relative to soil water absorption capacity of biochar table 1 and table 2 due to presence of intra pores and functional groups increased the water absorption capacity of the soil after amendment suliman et al 2017 nakhli and imhoff 2020 thereby increased the atterberg limits the water absorption capacity is the amount of water absorbed in pores within the material particles with respect to the dry mass of the material when the material is in water submerged condition astm c128 15 the specific gravity of the soils decreased when biochar 5 and 10 was amended table 3 this could be attributed to the replacement of heavy higher specific gravity soil particles with the lighter and porous biochar particles of allowing higher air entrapment reddy et al 2015 further the amendment of 5 to 10 biochar decreased the maximum dry density mdd of the soils while increased the optimum moisture content omc of the silty sand table 3 the lower specific gravity and internal porous structure of biochar increased the porosity and entrapment of air in soil liu et al 2017 after amendment which led to the lower compressibility reddy et al 2015 during compaction and hence reduced dry density conversely the higher water absorption capacity of the biochar table 1 compared to soil table 2 contributed to the increased omc guo et al 2014 fig 4 highlights the gsd curves of the bare and biochar amended silty sand and pure sand the amendment of 5 and 10 biochar in both the soils shifted the gsd curves downward with respect to the bare soil which indicates an increased number of larger size particles in amended soil compared to the bare soil and larger size particles could form larger size inter pores after compaction 3 3 effect of biochar on suction and water content response the variation of suction and volumetric water content of bare and biochar amended silty sand and pure sand with time for the middle row of sensors are presented in fig 5 a h for the sake of brevity the figure of other two rows of sensors i e the bottom and top row of sensors are not presented here further there was no significant change observed between the data of duplicated columns hence the data of single column set was presented which sufficed the purpose of comparison among the biochar treatment i e 0 5 and 10 fig 5 a b and fig 5 e f show the variation of suction with time for bare and biochar amended silty sand and pure sand under drying and wetting condition in drying process a suction of around 9 kpa was observed to be maintained for 150 200 h in fig 5 a and 5 e which ensures the saturated state of the soils thereafter suction increased with time and reached a peak value in the range of 5000 10000 kpa due to evaporation of water from pores by the capillary action in silty sand a longer duration compared to pure sand was taken to reach the peak which could be attributed to the uniform pore size distribution of silty sand formed by the presence of particles of all sizes the uniform pore size distribution of silty sand allowed water to evaporate slowly compared to the non uniform pore size distribution of pure sand leading to a longer duration to reach the peak in a same duration of time the peak suction was observed to be higher in bare soil compared with the biochar amended soils which ensures the higher water evaporation in bare soil and higher water retention in biochar amended soils similarly for a particular duration of time the pure sand both bare and amended showed a higher suction compared with silty sand due to the lower water retention capacity of pure sand in wetting process the suction observed to decrease with time and reached the minimum value of around 9 kpa first in bare soil and then in biochar amended soil fig 5 b and fig 5 f it ensures the higher hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate in bare soil compared to the biochar amended soil in general a suction value of 1500 kpa is considered as permanent wilting point pwp feddes et al 1978 the time required to reach the pwp is termed as the wilting time of the plant under water stress condition saha et al 2020 the amendment of the biochar in soils extend the time prolonged of wilting i e the bare silty sand reached the pwp within 1500 h and the 10 biochar amended silty sand reached that in 3000 h similarly the bare pure sand reached within 180 h while the 10 biochar amended pure sand reached in 210 h thus the biochar amendment slowed down the development of drought stress in soil fig 5 c d and fig 5 g h highlight the variation of volumetric water content θ with time for bare and biochar amended silty sand and pure sand under drying and wetting condition similar to suction profile the θ was observed to be decreased with time in drying process due to evaporation of water while increased in wetting process due to absorption of water further the θ was observed to be higher in biochar amended soil 10 w w compared with the bare soil for both the type of soils and under drying and wetting process which indicates the higher water retention capacity of biochar amended soil compared to the bare soil in wetting process the increase of θ was found to be quicker in bare soil confirming the higher hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate in bare soil compared with the biochar amended soil considering the soil type the decrease of water content in drying and increase in wetting process was observed to be abrupt in pure sand due to the larger pores size and non uniform pore size distribution in pure sand compared with silty sand of showing gradual change 3 4 effect of biochar on swrc fig 6 a f highlights the swrcs of bare and biochar 5 and 10 w w amended silty sand and pure sand under drying and wetting process the fitting parameters of the swrc are presented in table 4 the effect of biochar on swrcs is discussed with respect to the swrc parameters such as saturated water content θs air entry value aev n and residual water content θr that defines the water retention characteristics of the soil and also the pawc which controls the irrigation frequency and drought process it is clear from the data presented in table 4 that the θs of the silty sand and pure sand increased from 35 to 46 and 41 to 50 under drying process and 33 to 43 and 40 to 51 under wetting process respectively after amendment of 10 biochar the magnitude of θs was observed to be higher in pure sand compared to silty sand under both bare and amended state and the rate of increment in θs due to biochar amendment was observed to be higher in silty sand compared to pure sand the amendment of biochar showed no comparable change in the air entry value aev of the soils as a bare minimum difference physically may not be significant between the data of bare and biochar amended soil could be observed from table 4 the change in n due to biochar amendment was observed to be inconsistent in the silty sand while it decreased significantly from 1 76 to 1 34 under drying and 2 01 to 1 42 under wetting process in pure sand after 10 biochar amendment the magnitude of n was observed to be higher in pure sand compared to the silty sand the amendment of biochar increased the residual water content θr of the silty sand from 7 to 16 under drying and 9 to 17 under wetting process similarly the θr increased from 1 to 5 under drying and 2 to 6 under wetting in pure sand respectively among the soil type tested the rate of increment in θr due to biochar amendment was observed to be higher in pure sand the pawc of the silty sand and pure sand was observed to be increased from 9 to 13 and 32 to 35 under drying process and 5 to 8 and 32 to 36 under wetting process after amendment of biochar the biochar driven increase in pawc was found to be higher in silty sand further larger magnitudes of pawc in pure sand compared to silty sand could be seen from table 4 the amendment of biochar increased the total porosity of the soils table 3 the total porosity was theoretically calculated from the measured specific gravity and compaction density of the bare and biochar amended soil the increased porosity of soil due to biochar amendment was also reported by hussain et al 2021 and nakhli et al 2021 total porosity comprised of inter porosity by inter pores and intra porosity by intra pores the higher total porosity in biochar amended soil was attributed to the decreased dry density of the soils after biochar amendment table 3 the dry density of the soils changed with the biochar amendment rate due to which the initial compaction density was different among the soil columns and hence the total porosity the intra pores in biochar fig 1c added the intra porosity 1 8 after amending to soil and increased the soil ssa as it is evident from the higher water absorption capacity of biochar compared to the soils table 1 and table 2 the amendment of biochar increased the numbers of larger sized particles in gsd shifted below fig 4 that have generated larger size or more numbers of inter pores compared to the bare soil after compaction and hence increased the inter porosity table 3 the increased total porosity with larger ssa table 1 and the presence of surface functional groups fig 1d especially oh and c o groups allowed larger quantity of water to be stored and hence the higher θs since porosity is equivalent to the θs the larger magnitude of θs in pure sand compared to the silty sand was attributed to the lower initial compaction density of pure sand under both bare and amended state table 3 which led to the higher total porosity and hence the θs the observed higher improvement in θs of silty sand over pure sand was due to the higher increase of inter porosity by the formation of larger size or more numbers of inter pores in silty sand after biochar amendment table 3 the amendment rates of biochar were maintained same for both the soils ideally the intra porosity should remain same the silty sand consists of considerably higher 49 fines content compared to the pure sand 1 6 and thus have the chance to form larger size inter pores after biochar amendment table 2 the shape parameter n represents the transition zone of the swrc and is basically related to the pore size distribution of the soil the decrease of n after biochar amendment was attributed to the reduced pore size in biochar amended soil compared to the bare soil as in fig 6 for a particular water content in transition zone the pore size in biochar amended soil is smaller flattened curves and in the range of 1 µm 10 µm fig 6 which indicates the direct addition of smaller size intra pores 5 µm fig 1c and the settlement of smaller soil or biochar particles in the inter pores or reformation of inter pores after biochar amendment and thus reduced pores size in biochar amended soil abel et al 2013 andrenelli et al 2016 the larger size inter pores and non uniform pore size distribution of pure sand due to presence of single sized particles relative to the silty sand of all particles size ranges table 2 caused the steeper slope or larger magnitude of n in pure sand compared to the silty sand the amendment of biochar in pure sand decreased the inter pores size i e formed smaller sized inter pores and modified the pore size distribution towards uniformity which led the n to change larger extend in pure sand compared to silty sand of relatively uniform pore size distribution sun and lu 2014 reported an increased total porosity with reorganization of pore size into small and larger sizes in silty clay due to biochar amendment similarly wong et al 2018 mentioned a changed pore size distribution of kaolin clay from dominant 0 05 0 06 μm pores to 0 1 4 μm pores i e the pore size increased due to biochar amendment the parameter n physically represents the desaturation rate under drying and re saturation rate under wetting of soil thus the decreased n value due to biochar amendment could delay the drying and wetting process of the soil the increase of θr in biochar amended soils was attributed to the smaller size residual pores fig 6 which could be inter pores or intra pores that have retained water at larger suction due to their smaller size or diameter however intra pores are the smaller one mostly nanoscale to hold water at large suction the smaller sized pores held water tightly due to strong capillary action fredlund et al 2012 and resisted the water evaporation thus higher water retention the bare pure sand showed lower θr compared to the silty sand table 4 due to their large pores size however the amendment of biochar decreased the pores size higher extend in pure sand compared to the silty sand which led to the higher θr in biochar amended pure sand compared to silty sand i e the efficacy of biochar in improving θr was observed to be higher in pure sand the higher pawc in biochar amended soil indicates the higher stored water for vegetation to readily use during drought state the vegetation has strong influence in bioengineered structures in terms of improving structural stability through root reinforcement and hydrological process hussain et al 2020a the higher quantity of readily available water in soil after biochar amendment would help the plants to survive the drought stress and ultimately maintain the stability the difference was observed in the swrc parameters due to drying and wetting process table 4 clearly the effect of hysteresis could be observed in both the soils with or without biochar amendment fig 6a f the hysteresis loop is observed to be wider in silty sand compared to the pure sand the change in soil structure due to particular rearrangement or ink bottle effects volume change entrapment of air and alteration in wetting characteristics contact angle during drying wetting led to the hysteresis in the swrc fredlund et al 2012 although the swelling of samples during wetting was restrained by the confinement a small volume change due to shrinkage during drying could be possible in silty sand with clay and silt fraction since the samples of silty sand were prepared with an addition of initial moisture content however the shrinkage was expected to be negligible due to the absence of higher swelling clay minerals and the presence of confinement the shrinkage along with the change in pore size distribution due to particular rearrangement by the dying and followed by wetting led to the wider hysteresis loop in silty sand relative to the pure sand in pure sand only particular rearrangement during wetting caused the hysteresis and the absence of shrinkage swelling led to the lower hysteresis effect compared with silty sand thus the increased water retention in biochar amended soil that has been characterised by the fitting parameters could be beneficial for the growth of vegetation in bioengineered structures due to the reduced irrigation demand and reduced effect of drought stress 3 5 effect of biochar on hydraulic conductivity function fig 7 a h highlights the variation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat with suction i e the hydraulic conductivity function for bare and biochar 5 and 10 w w amended silty sand and pure sand under drying and wetting condition the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of bare and biochar amended silty sand and pure sand is also presented in figure for reference the kunsat was observed to be reached the maximum near to ksat at around 9 kpa fig 7 in drying state the kunsat decreased in both the soils with the increase of suction fig 7 a b e f the magnitude of kunsat was recorded as low as 10 12 m sec in the present study however literature meerdink et al 1996 li et al 2009 uzoma et al 2011 reported kunsat value lower than 10 12 m sec the magnitude of kunsat varies soil to soil and depends on the range of suction measured i e at large suction the kunsat could be very low further according to the error propagation rule the error in the measured suction will propagate to the kunsat values as follows 7 u k unsat k unsat u ψ ψ 2 where ukunsat is the uncertainty in the kunsat uψ is the uncertainty in the suction and ψ is the measured suction respectively however the calculation of kunsat is not based on the single ψ measurement i e for a single kunsat value two different ψ values at different points or sensors are used and the effect of which two different ψ can not be assessed from the error propagation rule eq 7 the increase of suction allows more air bubbles to entrap in soil these entrapped air bubbles block the hydraulic flow path thereby increased the tortuosity of water flow paths and decreased the kunsat further the amendment of biochar decreased the kunsat in both the soils under drying and wetting condition and the rate of decrement in kunsat was observed to be higher with the higher biochar amendment rate fig 7 the amendment of the biochar in soils reorganized the pore structure or pore size distribution of the soils by adding smaller size intra pores and possibly reforming smaller size inter pores as observed by sun and lu 2014 for silty clay which led to the increased tortuosity or tortuous flow path and hence reduced kunsat sun et al 2015 and blanco canqui 2017 reported an increased tortuosity in sandy soil after biochar amendment that affects the water flow path the lower kunsat of biochar amended soil compared to the bare soil was also justified from the delayed wetting and drying of biochar amended soil compared to bare soil observed from the suction and volumetric water content responses presented in fig 5 a h a steep change in kunsat with suction could be observed in silty sand fig 7 a d relative to pure sand fig 7 e h under drying and wetting condition that ensures the uniform and smaller pores size in silty sand compared to the pure sand thereby a small change in suction or pore water led to the sharp change in the kunsat differences could be observed in the hydraulic conductivity function of the soils under drying and wetting process i e at any suction the magnitude of kunsat in drying state fig 7 a b e f was always higher than that of the wetting state fig 7 c d g h in addition the effect of hysteresis was observed to be more pronounced in lower suction range compared to the large suction range the lower volumetric water content along the wetting path due to the change in pore structure contact angle and the entrapment of air during drying and wetting process led to the lesser hydraulic flow path and hence the lower kunsat in wetting process the influence of the changed pore structure or capillarity was more strong at lower suction range compared to the large suction that it has caused the higher hysteresis effect at lower suction range hillel 1998 al mahbashi et al 2018 the deviation of wetting path kunsat from the drying path hysteresis was observed to be more in silty sand compared to the pure sand and attributed to the higher change in pore structure due to particular rearrangement in silty sand of containing fines clay and silt the fine grained soil generally undergoes higher structural changes or particular rearrangement due to their mineralic action al mahbashi et al 2018 considering the soil type tested the pure sand always including drying and wetting process exhibited a higher hydraulic conductivity kunsat or ksat over silty sand due to their highly porous structure that provides larger passage for water to flow there was no comparable variation observed in kunsat in different location or between three rows of sensors i e k1 and k2 in fig 7a h in a same soil column under either of drying or wetting conditions which ensured the maintenance of uniform soil compaction along the depth 4 conclusions the influence of biochar amendment on the water retention and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of compacted soils for potential application in bioengineered structures was investigated and presented in this study 1 d column study using ipm technique was carried out in compacted silty sand and pure sand amended with 5 and 10 biochar produced from mesquite the following conclusion can be drawn 1 the amendment of biochar changed the physical properties of the soils i e increased the atterberg limits by 6 26 and decreased the specific gravity and dry density by 6 8 and 8 15 the internal porous structure of biochar intra pores caused the change in the soil properties after amendment 2 water retention characterised by the swrc parameters was observed to be increased by on an average 30 150 in both silty sand and pure sand due to the biochar amendment hydraulic hysteresis was observed in water retention of the both bare and biochar amended soils due to drying wetting process the altered pore size distribution and porosity of the soils after biochar amendment and the surface functional groups in biochar contributed to the changed water retention 3 the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity kunsat of the soils was found to be decreased by on an average one two order of magnitude after biochar amendment and the hysteresis similar to that in water retention was also observed the alteration of pore size distribution of the soils after biochar amendment made the water flow path more tortuous and hence reduced the kunsat the increased water retention and decreased kunsat in biochar amended soils resulting in higher quantity of available water for plants and lower percolation and evaporation loss from soils these potentially would help in the growth of vegetation in bioengineered structures in arid or semi arid region by reducing the effect of drought stress and the demand of irrigation the findings of the present study suggests the application of biochar amended soils in bioengineered structures however further field scale studies are needed to better understand the soil biochar hydraulic interaction in addition the particles size of biochar affects the porosity i e the effect of biochar particles size on the water retention and kunsat of soils need to be considered credit authorship contribution statement rojimul hussain conceptualization methodology investigation data curation writing original draft k ravi supervision writing review
