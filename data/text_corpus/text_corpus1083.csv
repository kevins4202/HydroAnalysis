5415,anthropogenic activities affect the water bodies and result in a drastic reduction of river water quality wq the development of a reliable intelligent model for evaluating the suitability of water remains a challenging task facing hydro environmental engineers the current study is investigated the applicability of extreme gradient boosting xgb and genetic programming gp in obtaining feature importance and then abstracted input variables were imposed into the predictive model the extreme learning machine elm for the prediction of water quality index wqi the stand alone modeling schema is compared with the proposed hybrid models where the optimum variables are supplied into the gp xgb linear regression lr stepwise linear regression swlr and elm models the wq data is obtained from the department of environment doe malaysia and results are evaluated in terms of determination coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse the results demonstrated that the hybrid gpelm and xgbelm models outperformed the standalone gp xgb and elm models for the prediction of wqi at kinta river basin a comparison of the hybrid models showed that the predictive skill of gpelm rmse 3 441 training and rmse 3 484 testing over xgbelm improving the accuracy by decreasing the values of rmse by 5 and 9 for training and testing respectively with regards to xgbelm rmse 3 606 training and rmse 3 816 testing although regressions are often proposed as reference models lr and swlr when combined with computational intelligence they still provide satisfactory results in this study the proposed hybrid gpelm and xgbelm models have improved the prediction accuracy with minimum number of input variables and can therefore serve as reliable predictive tools for wqi at kinta river basin keywords water quality index watershed management extreme gradient boosting genetic programming extreme learning machine kinta river 1 introduction the continuous reduction in wq remained a top global concern especially in terms of industrial agricultural and domestic utilization several factors including geological weather hydrological industrial source such as textile laundry and pharmaceutical etc and natural phenomena physical processes have adverse effect on the quality of water abba and elkiran 2017 ke et al 2015 in literature water pollution is described as presence of detrimental substance s in water to the level that causes problems to living organisms therefore monitoring water features to ensure the quality of is of paramount importance mahmoodabadi and rezaei arshad 2018 wq can be considered as set of chemical physical and biological properties of water that can be utilized in forecasting the water quality sharma and kansal 2011 wq helps in determining the chemicals concentration in the water thus assessment of wq can be describe as the analysis chemical physical and biological properties of water in the literature several studies have been carried out in the area of water quality singh 2017 following this wqi provide a single parameter describing the water quality reducing the huge number of parameters to a simpler expression thereby making the monitoring and interpretation wq effortless gazzaz et al 2012 however wq is dependent on the ecosystem as well as human usages such as industrial pollution sewage and wastewater and both international and national agencies are committed to pollution control and wq analysis bharti 2011 factually there is no single variable can express the wq efficiently the wq is normally determined by measuring multiple wq parameters hameed et al 2017 for this purpose large amount of data is collected by the monitoring team which must be easily interpretable for decision makers and the general public in in this regard numerous wqis have been developed which are defined based on wq criteria and important parameters bharti 2011 wqi is a widely used measure in different parts of the world to solve problems of data management and to evaluate the successes as well as failures of management strategies for improving water quality while numerous indices are used in summarizing wq data to an understandable format wqi is derived from numerous water characterization parameters to signifies water quality level abbasi 2002 in essence general approach to computing wqi involve passing numerous water quality parameters into computable functions and logical expressions that rates the wellbeing of a water body with a solitary number castilla herná 2014 the computed value is then rated from very bad to excellent based on existing rating scale which is understandable in ascertaining wq by non technical water managers political decision makers and the general public abbasi 2002 over the decades various wqi have been defined globally these wqi help to represent the overall wq in that particular area efficiently including the united state national sanitation foundation wqi nsfwqi horton 1965 bharti 2011 the canadian council of ministers of the environment wqi ccmewqi sharma 2002 khan et al 2004 the british columbia water quality index bcwqi and oregon wqi owqi debels et al 2005 these indices are based on a comparison of the wq parameters to regulatory standards and give a single value to the water quality of a source abba et al 2019 despite the several paradigms that can be used to assess the quality of water malaysian department of environments doe approved the use of a unified water quality indices in 1974 for analysis and ranking the level of contamination and pollution of malaysian rivers this recommended adaptation of wqi is called the doe wqi and served as method of choice for calculating the wq index of local malaysian rivers gazzaz et al 2012 yaseen et al 2018a b c doe wqi gives a standard wq guidelines use to classify the wq of malaysian local rivers to five categories depending on their appropriateness for different usage including irrigation domestic supplies and fish culture water supply recreational use livestock drinking the application used for computing the water quality in malaysia is almost same as that employed in muhammad et al 2015 gazzaz et al 2012 yaseen et al 2018a b c however the analysis and calculation of this method generally requires significant amounts of time and effort which could lead to accidental errors during the sub index computations nevertheless the method has proved to be highly effective and successful in practice based on scientific fact for detailed manual calculation of the wq sub index for malaysia refer to hameed et al 2017 gazzaz et al 2012 recent research shows that there is exponential increase in the use of artificial intelligence ai which represents an alternative attractive quick and direct computing tool for water quality modeling tiyasha et al 2020 sahoo patra 2020 gaya et al 2020 yasin and karim 2020 karim and kamsani 2020 ai has the ability to minimize the error effort and computation time bhagat et al 2019 artificial neural network ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and support vector regression svr are among the popular artificial intelligence modeling methods developed for highly complicated process and handling data nonlinearity barzegar et al 2016 however several researchers have employed different combinations of ai based models to predict the wqi wagener et al 2019 yaseen et al 2018b for example nourani et al 2013 proposed the application of an ann to monitor treated water quality the results indicated that ann has the potential to perform better than the conventional wq method emamgholizadeh et al 2014 applied ann and anfis models simultaneously to predict the wq variables of the karoon river water and the model results indicated the ann model have a better predictive ability compared to anfis based models in this regard barzegar et al 2016 investigated the performance of standalone ann and anfis and hybrid wavelet ann and wavelet anfis for the prediction of monthly averaged water salinity of aji chay river in northwest iran where the results showed that anfis performance was superior to ann hameed et al 2017 examined two different models viz radial basis function nn rbfnn and back propagation nn bpnn the results from both models shows the reliable performance with improved accuracy similarly ann model was employed to estimate the wqi at langat river basin malaysia and the outcomes was compared with the traditional multilinear regression analysis the obtained results demonstrated the effectiveness of the ann model for the prediction of wqi juahir et al 2004 gazzaz et al 2012 studied the potential of an ann model to predict the wqi in malaysia the results demonstrated that the ann model offered a reliable alternative to wqi computation and forecasting mohammadpour et al 2014 studied and compared the potential of support vector machine svm bpnn and rbfnn techniques to predict the wqi in a wetland for this purpose different wq variables at 17 monitoring points were evaluated the results showed that svm and ffbp outperformed rbf and therefore emerged as successful and reliable models for the prediction of wqi the outcomes also indicated that the methods can reliably reduce time and computational burdens more recently yaseen et al 2018a b c employed different types of ai based models to predict the wqi abba et al 2019 presented a performance comparison analysis of non linear models based on rbfnn and hammerstein weiner hw techniques and traditional linear modelling technique based on generalized linear regression glr and autoregressive integrated moving average arima for agra station of yamuna river india and kinta river in malaysia the simulation results established that the non linear models outperformed the other models based on the above literature it is evident that studies in the field of wq and wqi conducted around the world have shown the reliability of computational intelligence models tiyasha et al 2020 although there is a significant increase in the use of ai models in the field of wqi prediction yet many standalone ai models produce unsatisfactory results due to some related limitations to the identification of the appropriate input parameters or the selection of the internal models parameters particularly in applications involving very dynamic hydrological processes hence to alleviate the aforementioned shortcomings it is mandatory to develop an appropriate structure and to have a proper selection technique of the suitable variables this has been proven to be significantly influential in the prediction ability for complex non linear processes in order to provide a reliable alternative to manual wq computation hence the objective of this study is to investigate the potential of xgb and gp in obtaining the feature importance and then the abstracted inputs are used in the predictive model i e elm for comparison purpose the proposed models are compared with the stand alone schema where the optimum combination of input variables are applied to the xgb gp elm and linear regression lr models the primary motivation behind the current study is to explore the abilities of the gp and xgb approaches for choosing the most dominant related variables in this regard hybrid models are established to increase the prediction accuracy of the non tuned data intelligent models for mimicking the river wq pattern however it is important to mention that since the development of this new algorithm to the best of the authors knowledge no research or technical literature has been published in respect of application of xgb in wqi prediction and as an essential method of input selection because of its distinctive and outstanding features this study used xgb algorithm in both input selection and wqi modelling the remaining sections of the paper are arranged as follows section 2 presents the applied methodology for single model and proposed modeling schema adopted in the study section 3 described the case study and the data description while the application of result and analysis are given in section 4 and the paper ends with a conclusion in section 5 2 applied methodology 2 1 extreme gradient boosting xgb the xgb algorithm has lately been dominating supervised machine learning applications such as regression and classification pradhan and sameen 2020 it is an improvement of the gradient boosting technique introduced by friedman 2001 it possesses the salient features of gradient tree boosting methods such as computational efficiency high processing ability and learning speed it uses a more precise approximation to find the best decision tree model to achieve a higher speed and better performance it is generally more than ten times faster than the conventional gradient boosting technique chen and guestrin 2016 xgb is an ensemble technique like random forests this algorithm is attributed to the set of classification and regression trees cart as it differs from decision tree dt in that each of the leaves has a real score that helps in richer interpretation that beyond the classification which is the case in dt in cart a single tree is used which is incapable and weak to some extent hence an ensemble of multiple trees is proposed hadi et al 2019 xiong et al 2007 however although xgb has been implemented in a wide range of applications for example stream flow hadi et al 2019 yu et al 2020 shear strength zhang et al 2020 and heat transfer qian et al 2020 the use of the algorithm in wqi prediction in general and as a reliable means of input parameter selection with wavelet remain unexplored in the literature for this purpose and given the excellent features of this algorithm it is used in this work for both the modelling and input selection processes the ensemble of k trees for xi i e wq variables inputs dataset to forecast yi i e wqi target can be expressed mathematically see eq 1 1 y k 1 k f k x i f k f where f k is a function in a set of all likely function in carts f the set of these functions optimization is the major objective of this function as presented in eq 2 chen et al 2019 is 2 o b j θ i 1 n l y i y i i 1 t ω f i where l is the regularization function used to avoid overfitting and ω is the training loss function a unary function is considered during the training as it is difficult to train with all the functions simultaneously f i hence representing the prediction value at step t as y i t leads to chen et al 2019 3 y i t k 1 t f k x i y i t 1 f t x i upon substituting the forecasted values given by eq 3 the tree that minimizes the objective function eq 4 is added to accomplish the performance of each iteration considering mean squared error as the loss function the cost function can be expressed as chen et al 2015 4 obj t i 1 n y i y i t 1 f t x i 2 i 1 t ω f i which can also be in the form of eq 5 chen et al 2015 5 obj t i 1 n 2 y i t 1 y i f t x i f t x i 2 ω f t c o n s t a n t mostly a second order taylor s expansion is used due to the fact that logistic functions have a tendency of becoming complicated as expressed in eq 6 chen et al 2015 6 obj t i 1 n l y i y i t 1 g i f t x i 1 2 h i f t x i 2 ω f t c o n s t a n t where g i y i t 1 l y i y i t 1 and h i y i t 1 2 l y i y i t 1 the tree can be described by f t x w q x while the regularization function is expressed in eq 7 7 ω f γ t 1 2 λ j 1 t w j 2 therein t is the total number of trees and q represents the scores on the leaves that is used to assign the function of every data point to corresponding leaf by eliminating the constants from eq 7 the objective function can be rewritten as in eq 8 8 obj t i 1 n g i w q x i 1 2 h i w q x i 2 γ t 1 2 λ j 1 t w j 2 j 1 t i i i g i w j 1 2 i i i h i λ w j 2 γ t where i i i q x i j refers to the jth leaf data index defining g j i i i g i and h j i i i h i one can write the objective function as in eq 9 9 obj t j 1 t g j w j 1 2 h j λ w j 2 γ t hence for any tree structure q x the performance can be obtained by using the best w j and objective functions see eq 10 and 11 respectively 10 w j g j h j λ 11 obj 1 2 j 1 t g j h j λ γ t moreover eq 12 is employed for optimization of the both the score gain and the tree in splitting a leaf into two 12 gain 1 2 g l 2 h l λ g r 2 h r λ g l g r 2 h l h r λ γ in eq 12 r and l indicate the score on new right and left leaves on the original leaves and the regularization terms if a branch gain is less such branch is dropped from the tree this algorithm is employed in obtaining the feature importance 2 2 extreme learning machine elm the elm is a novel ffnn with a single hidden layer it was first introduced and named by huang et al 2006 elm was invented to eliminate the over fitting and sluggish training speed issues attributed to the classical ffnn algorithms in this method a special least square solution based on the moore penrose inverse function is used to obtain the weights between the output layer and the hidden layer while the bias of the hidden neurons and the weight between the hidden layer and the input layer are randomly initialized yaseen et al 2016 the randomly initialized hidden neurons remain fixed elm can efficiently achieve a globally optimal solution because of its universal approximation abilities huang et al 2006 huang et al 2015 in recent years several researchers have used the elm method in many areas of hydrological modelling owing to its robustness and high precision in streamflow prediction as in yaseen et al 2019 the elm model was developed using a training data set x 1 y 1 x t y t in this context the input vector denoted as x 1 x 2 x t are defined as the wq variables and the output vector y 1 y 2 y t represents the observed wqi mathematically for n training sets t 1 2 n where x t r d and y t r an slfn with h hidden nodes is given by huang et al 2006 as in eq 13 13 i 1 h b i g i α i x t β i z t where i is index of the hidden layer node α i and β i represent the weight and bias of the randomized layers and d indicates the number of inputs similarly b r h g α β x and z z t r are the predicted weights of the output layer hidden layer neurons activation function and model output respectively the sigmoid function is found to be the best activation function for this study yaseen et al 2020 see eq 14 14 g x 1 1 e x p x linear activation function is employed in output layer as illustrated in eq 15 for elm models the error can be reduced to zero by selecting the appropriate number of hidden neurons randomized hidden layer biases β and input layer weights α hence the weights of output layer may be found as huang et al 2006 15 t 1 n z t y t 0 system of linear equations is used to find the value of b for any given input output training samples is expressed in eq 16 16 y g b where g is expressed in eq 17 17 g α β x g x 1 g x n g 1 α 1 x 1 β 1 g l w h x 1 β h g 1 α n x n β 1 g l w h x n β f n h and b is expressed in eq 18 18 b b 1 t b h t h 1 and y is expressed in eq 19 19 y y 1 t y n t n 1 where g denotes the output of the hidden layer b can be estimated using moore penrose inverse function by inverting the hidden layer matrix see eq 20 20 b g y lastly the estimated y which represent the predicted wqi for this study can be obtained as in eq 21 21 y i 1 h b i g i α i x t β i 2 3 genetic programming gp gp is one of the state of the art machine learning algorithms that works on the basis of darwinian s evolution theory igwe and pillay 2014 gp varies from traditional regression techniques as it simply involves the determination of numerical coefficients for a function with a pre specified structure olyaie et al 2017 on the one hand gp optimizes both the parameters and structure of an input output map contrary to neural networks nns user tuning is not required in developing gp based models danandeh mehr et al 2013 in the gp technique solutions are denoted as evolutionary parsing trees where the primary population is randomly generated however successive generations are obtained with the help of basic genetic operators crossover mutation and selection reproduction peirovi minaee et al 2019 gp has been effectively implemented to solve several problems in the fields of image processing feedback control systems electronic circuits computer vision and data classification amongst others 2 4 linear regression lr the traditional lr can be categorized into simple regression which is used to estimate a single predictor and a single criterion variable and multiple regression which involves the estimations of more than one predictor but still with a single criterion variable for this study multiple regression analysis is used which is also called multilinear regression analysis according to chen and liu 2015 the multilinear regression model is the most widely used type of linear regression and involves an analysis whereby each value from the independent variables is related to a dependent variable value the lr used in this study can be expressed as in eq 22 22 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b i x i where x 1 is the value of the ith predictor b 0 is the regression constant and b i is the coefficient of the ith predictor 2 5 step wise linear regression swlr regression analysis appeared to be the frequently used exploratory approach in citing dependencies between the two categories of variables i e dependent and independent while expressing dependencies between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables it is paramount to find the optimum set of the variables that provide best prediction accuracy with respect to the dependent variable yasar et al 2012 according to çevik 2007 described the stepwise regression as a forward selection process which select the optimum set of independent variables through addition or deletion of the variable variables with the greatest influence on the residual sum of squares swlr follows stepwise refinement of the variable s by rechecking the importance of previously added variables based on their partial sum of squares when the partial sum of squares for any recently added variable s does not satisfy a base rule to remain in the models the selection strategy is changed to deletion state and that variables are discarded gradually until every remaining variable meet the base rule yasar et al 2012 the concept of stepwise could be established using multiple linear regression as expressed in eq 22 all the independent variables x i are entered into the regression equation one by one in accordance with their influence on the dependent variable y when each independent variable is entered a series of t tests are conducted for selected variables one by one in order to retain the statistically significant independent variables wu et al 2020 zhang and chang 2016 the process of entering or removing an independent variable from the regression equation e g eq 22 is a step of the stepwise regression it also performs the significance test using the f test at each step if it is passed the t test results of each variable in the equation are checked until the p value is less than 0 10 this process is repeated until no significant independent variables are entered into or removed from the regression equation from there an optimized regression equation could be obtained lachniet and patterson 2006 2 6 proposed modeling schema the main objective of the study is to find a tool for selecting inputs to improve the prediction of the wqi therefore the schema of the study is to use gp and xgb as a nonlinear selection tool in addition to using them as the main model or prediction model afterwards the selected inputs are to be entered into elm and lr to assess their performance and compare them with the standalone models gp xgb elm and lr in detail the methodology of the study is that the data was firstly normalized by using the following equation see eq 23 23 n x x m i n x max x m i n x where nx is the normalized value x is the original value and x is all the values of the variable the normalized variables were entered directly into the used techniques gp xgb elm lr and swlr and this schema was called the standalone schema secondly another schema is proposed based on the advantages of the gp and xgb models in obtaining the feature importance and that schema is used to select only the most important features which contribute in the prediction of the wqi and impose them into elm and lr a visualization of the methodology is shown in fig 1 these two schemas are compared in order to obtain the advantage of selecting the inputs and the ability of gp and xgb in selecting the inputs several parameters need to be considered in the modeling process in each of the used techniques the gp model was run many times to find the best parameters and particularly the best tree length and depth the best mutation probability generation population size was found to be 15 1000 and 1000 respectively after fixing these parameters tree length and depth were also tuned by trial and error for the xgb grid tuning was used to obtain the best values of several parameters such as maximum tree depth eta and gamma in the elm technique 1 to 150 hidden neuron numbers were used and the best is obtained by an algorithm that compares determination coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse of each one and the best performed hidden neuron was chosen three evaluation measurements metrics were used namely r2 and rmse mean absolute percentage error mape ehteram et al 2020 khosravi et al 2019 see eqs 24 26 24 r 2 1 i 1 n wqi obs i wqi pred i 2 i 1 n wqi obs i wqi obs 2 25 rmse i 1 n wqi prd i 2 n 26 mape 1 n i 1 n wqi obsi wqi comi wqi obsi where n wqi wqi obsi and wqi predi are data number observed wqi average value of the observed wqi and predicted wqi value respectively 3 case study and data description river kinta span an area of about 2500 km2 and a length of about 100 km within kinta district it supports farming activities residential areas and industries fig 2 across its three subdivisions i e upstream undulating and downstream on the other hand stations 2pk34 and 2pk25 are the center of the river at the upstream there are stations 2pk22 2pk24 and stations 2pk55 and 2pk19 are the downstream kinta river is largely utilized for forestry and recreation along the upstream the densely populated ipoh city is located at the center of the river characterized by commercial and industrial activities kinta river dam constructed in the year 2000 with an attempt to raise the supply of perak by around 25 is the most important and second most important source of water to ipoh and perak respectively it has a daily production capacity of 639 000 m3 which is expected to be sufficient for kinta valley until 2020 ghani et al 2007 gazzaz et al 2012 according to doe malaysia 120 of the 189 rivers are monitored and controlled four decades ago wqi was the recommended water pollution assessment and ranking index by the doe along the rivers based on an approach named opinion poll wqi op wqi for calculating the water quality index of the local rivers doe estimates showed that 44 5 are clean rivers 48 4 are slightly polluted and 7 1 are polluted nonetheless rainfall as the main source of water contribute 96 water supply to all kinds of surface water bodies i e channels rivers impoundment and reservoirs ghani et al 2007 gazzaz et al 2012 the measured water quality data was obtained from doe malaysia for 12 years period between 2002 and 2013 with 301 instances the data was recorded from several monitoring stations located on the kinta river malaysia the wq parameters are ss do bod cod temperature temp total solids ts ph and wqi from the complete data 75 is used for training while 25 is set for testing the models the statistical description of the data is given in table 1 despite there are other important wq parameters but the available parameters selected for the purposed of this research were considered as the one of the most dominants parameters in the determination of wqi as confirmed by other several studies such as muhammad et al 2015 gazzaz et al 2012 yaseen et al 2018a b c in addition selecting these parameters was based on the non linear input variables selection approach which is according the most sensitive to the target variables it should note that another feasible alternative could also be used with regards to selection approach however the proposed modeling schema could also be applicable in modeling other important parameters from table 1 the terms xmin xmax xm xmean sx and csx denote minimum maximum median mean standard deviation and skewness the wq parameters show variability trends in terms of the maximum and minimum values the wqi from 43 to 96 mg l do concentration varies from 0 28 to 9 93 mg l high values of wq parameters indicate that the kinta river receives significant non biodegradable organic matter which is due to the excessive anthropogenic activities in the recent years that significantly contribute to water pollution zhu and heddam 2019 characterized the wq of huaxi and yipin river as being polluted with do 2 9 10 and do 5 2 10 5 respectively according to elkiran et al 2019 partially treated and untreated domestic and industrial wastewaters discharged into the river could lead to low do concentration according to danandeh mehr et al 2013 and olyaie et al 2017 a very high csx can affect the performance of ai ann considerably while a low csx is more appropriate for modelling the variation pattern of the wq parameters confirms the non linear and complicated process of modeling do concentration both mean and median indicated where the centre of the data is located it can be seen in table 1 that the values of mean are slightly larger than the median this indicated the positive direction of skewness with regards to mean values according litosseliti 2010 the mean is best for un skewed data with no outliers while the median can tolerate skew and outlier s data similarly the validation of the datasets was conducted using k fold cross validation the main aim of validation is to fit the model to the given dataset to obtain a reliable and accurate prediction on the datasets for this purpose in the k fold cross validation the training and the validation datasets are independent this advantage makes this method promising with a sound foundation for optimizing the model the k fold cross validation approach has been widely implemented in various hydro environmental studies even though other feasible alternatives may also be used tsioptsias et al 2016 4 application results and analysis the accuracy of intelligent models is affected by the use of numerous inputs several inputs selection methods have been reported in hydro environmental literatures popular among them includes correlation auto correlation and principal components analysis nevertheless these methods are frequently used for input output linear relationships hadi and tombul 2018 this study employed two novel nonlinear input variables selection tools gp and xgb for choosing the most dominant related inputs to the targeted variable to improve the accuracy of the models prediction after that the appropriately selected inputs are entered into non tuned data intelligence and regression models to assess their performance in comparison with the standalone models gp xgb elm lr and swlr the period used is sufficient to ensure the profile information of the kinta river fig 3 shows further analysis to indicate the direction and strength of association between the various stations via correlation matrix for any computational intelligence techniques it is essential to assess the correlation coefficient between the wq variables the correlation coefficient indicated the association between the selected stations and illustrate the proportionality relations between the dependent and the independent variables 4 1 results of gp and gpelm this section demonstrates the results of running the gp standalone and hybrid elm gpelm model table 2 only shows several important trials to save some space according to table 2 the best performing trial was trial 2 with a tree length of 20 and a tree depth of 100 which is also very close to trial 3 in terms of performance with regard to complexity trial 3 is the best as three input variables were excluded from the model while in trial 2 only two were excluded and that reduces the complexity and due to the difference in the performance between the two trials trial 3 was chosen as the overall best the relevance in terms of importance of the features for the trials is also extracted and not only for the best model but in order to get the full image of the importance and prove the real importance of these features table 3 shows the obtained results according to table 2 trial 3 with a combination of do bod ts and cod has the highest performance accuracy in terms of model complexity regarding the performance accuracy of the trials 2 and 3 trial 2 outperformed trial 3 with slight increment in goodness of fit for both training and testing phases furthermore the direct comparison of the trials clearly demonstrated that trial 2 to trial 6 achieved the best prediction skills and hence emerged as reliable combinations for the prediction of wqi at kinta river a goodness of fit criteria value equal 1 signifies a perfect estimation but generally a model with goodness of fit 0 7 is acceptable shukla et al 2008 it is evident from table 2 that r2 values of trial 2 6 in this study 0 7 the variables are sorted according to the mean of their relevance importance after determining the importance of the inputs from the best model of the gp shown in the table 4 only these variables are entered into the elm in the same order of their importance table 4 shows that the importance is not proportional to the correlation for example bod has a higher correlation with wqi than ts while the opposite is correct in terms of the importance as ts has higher importance than bod ph also has a higher correlation than cod ph is not even entered in the prediction of the wqi as its importance is 0 this is due to the fact that the correlation is a linear index that only explains the linear relation between the dependent and independent variables while in reality the relation between them is not linear the degree of importance of the inputs of both xgb and gp schemas is presented in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that temp ph and ss have zero importance according to the gp input selection approach in other words adding these variables has no or negligible impact on the prediction accuracy in the estimation of wqi although several studies such as ji et al 2017 elkiran 2018 and shi et al 2019 reported that temp and ph are among the significant wq variables they are considered to be insignificant when using evolutionary input selection approach in this study the results of the gpelm model in which only the selected variables are entered into the elm model are shown in table 5 and the best gp and elm models results are also listed in order to compare them according to table 5 the gpelm has higher performance and the training and test subsets are very close while there is a significant difference between them in the gp model and this could be due to the tree nature of the gp model which leads to overfitting a visual comparison between the three computational intelligence techniques shows the accurate performances in terms of rmse and r2 it can be vividly seen that integrating gp with the elm model exhibits the highest performance in the prediction of wqi also the numerical results indicated that for the forecasting of wqi at kinta river gpelm with r2 0 908 and rmse 3 484 values in the testing phase was demonstrated to have excellent prediction skills in comparison to gp and elm and therefore emerged as a reliable model fig 5 a c present the scatter and time series plots for the observed vs predicted wqi in the testing phase it is clear from the figure that the best predictive model is gpelm in which the prediction array was closer with the observed wqi another quantitative investigation of the results with reference to r2 and rmse in the testing phase depicted that the gpelm model increased by r2 21 and r2 56 and decreased by rmse 16 and rmse 9 compared to gp and elm models during the testing stage respectively 4 2 results of xgb and xgbelm xgb was tuned for finding the best parameter by using grid tuning several parameters were tuned in which multiple models were created and to save space only the important trials are listed in table 6 xgb hyper tuning techniques were implemented in order to achieve the optimum values of these parameters that lead to the best results from table 6 trial 3 was chosen as the best trial with its parameters as it has the highest r2 0 877 for the test subset and has the lowest rmse 4 062 for training and testing subsets after choosing the best tuned model the importance matrix of the features inputs or dependent variables are also extracted as listed in table 4 the inputs after that are entered into the elm according to their order in the importance matrix as proposed by hadi et al 2019 the results showed that the use of only the first four features in the importance matrix do bod cod and ts obtains the best results and that is therefore identified as the best model the results of the best xgb and best xgbelm model are shown in table 7 although the xgb model has not received any attention in do prediction this model has proved to be effective in streamflow prediction hadi et al 2019 according to the presented results xgb combinations do bod cod and ts demonstrated the prediction skill with r2 0 933 and rmse 3 036 for training phase and r2 0 877 and rmse 4 062 for testing phase the predictability performance of xgb is therefore not surprising owing to it significant accuracy in hadi et al 2019 fig 6 a c show scatter plots between the observed and predicted values of the xgb elm and xgbelm from the figure it is clear that a closeness agreement between the observed and predicted values was attained the overall comparison of the computational intelligence techniques indicates the satisfactory performance accuracy of gp elm xgbgp and xgbelm models in both training and testing phases which can be justified by considering the correlation coefficient cc 0 7 according to legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 and zhu and heddam 2019 cc values higher than 0 70 are considered acceptable thus the results of all four models are acceptable the numerical predictive accuracy of the models was also evaluated and the outcomes showed that gpelm and xgbelm yielded the best performance accuracy compared to the other single models although gp and xgb slightly outperformed the two hybrid models in some statistical indices the hybrid models are considered the most reliable based on the agreement between training and testing phases detailed investigation for predicting wqi at kinta river reveals that the model that obtains the best accuracy in the training phase may not necessarily represent as the best model in addition the impact of various wq variables on wqi is different this leads to the conclusion that the models that benefit from both the training and testing phases such as gpelm and xgbelm are capable of capturing the highly complex and nonlinear relationship generally in hydro environmental studies there are several factors that affect the predictive accuracy of the models however potential factor affecting the accuracy in this study could certainly be the low correlation coefficient between wqi and ph temp and ss another reason could be due to the pollution increase caused by anthropogenic activities on the banks of the river which drastically reduce the accuracy of the models this statement is in line with the conclusion drawn by zhu and heddam 2019 the study conducted by ji et al 2017 also proved that there is a significant correlation between the do wq parameters except for temp the comparison of hybrid models depicted that the predictive skill of gpelm rmse 3 441 and rmse 3 484 over xgbelm rmse 3 606 and rmse 3 816 thus improving its accuracy by decreasing the values of rmse by 5 and 9 for training and testing respectively 4 3 results of linear regression linear regression was also used in this study as another model for comparison with the proposed models as a benchmark the linear regression was firstly used with all variables as inputs secondly stepwise linear regression swlr was used in order to obtain the best results by choosing only the important variables and thirdly the variables selected by the gp and xgb were entered to check the performance of the linear prediction of these variables the evaluation measurements of the three models are shown in table 8 according to the results the swlr model has the highest performance in comparison with the other models the model of gp or xgb with lr in which the inputs selected by gp and xgb is entered into the lr has the worst performance the swlr excluded ph temp and ts as they have no significance in the prediction as shown in table 9 this exclusion increased the performance of the model in comparison with the model that used all the variables as inputs in the model that used the inputs selected by gp xgb in which ss ph and temp were excluded the performance also deteriorated dramatically although all the variables were significant according to table 9 it is important to mention that the use of elm alone has a very similar performance to the lr by including all the variables but using them as the second step in the model after selecting the inputs elm increased the performance dramatically while for lr it dramatically decreased the performance this is due to several reasons the linear and non linear nature of the gp and xgb in obtaining the importance of the features which is used in the selection of the inputs the elm non linear prediction capability in comparison with the lr which is only linear and most of the non linear relationships cannot be revealed although regressions are often proposed as a reference model when combined with computational intelligence they still provide satisfactory results the performance of linear regression could be decreased for problems involving complex processes as shown in table 8 gp xgblr are inferior to the lr and swlr in terms of predicting wqi values negligible changes were observed between lr and swlr in both training and testing fig 7 a c present the scatter and time series plots lr gp xgblr and swlr for the observed and predicted values in the testing phase based on the visual examination of the predicted and observed wqi values during the testing stage the prediction made by lr and swlr are closer to the observed wqi than those made by gp xgblr further examination of the graph shows that with respect to goodness of fit r2 0 850 and statistical error rmse 0 4074 in the testing phase swlr outperformed the other two models in term of prediction skills another pertinent conclusion can be made from scatter plots obtained through lr gp xgblr and swlr in the testing phase denotes the ideal results in line 1 1 in particular the closer the data points are to this line the better the result produced by the model ji et al 2017 yaseen et al 2019 the comparison of the predictive accuracies of all the models is illustrated by using a radar chart radar charts are essential in models performance comparison because of its clarity and ability to show the tips of the variable scores in the dataset in this study radar charts are used in terms of cc for both the training and testing stages fig 8 shows the radar chart illustrating the various cc values for all the models it is observed from fig 8 that the cc values in the training and testing phases are 0 959 0 941 for gp 0 965 0 936 for xgb 0 955 0 952 for gpelm 0 951 0 953 for xgbelm 0 913 0 923 for elm 0 914 0 956 for lr 0 886 0 941 for gp xgblr and 0 914 0 956 for swlr moreover box plots were used to demonstrate how close the comparisons of all the model s predictions are between the observed and predicted wqi as shown in fig 9 the level of overall spread in the observed and forecasted values can be inferred from the various whiskers and quartiles according to the graph the spread of gpelm and xgbelm meticulously resembles the observed wqi the exploratory analysis for all the models can be better pictured through the boxplots in fig 9 boxplots are a powerful graphical representation of data that provide an overview and a statistical summary of a data set samsudin et al 2019 according to fig 8 the closest of all the models to the observed values is selected to be the best model based on the mean value the plot contained box and whisker median mean and staples the extent of the spread values between the observed and predicted models indicates that the hybrid models gpelm and xgbelm emerged as the best among all the models as ai models are used such models try to map the data by the training phase as much as they can but in the testing phase as these data are not shown to the model they behave different and that is inherited property to the ai models also for data intelligence algorithms when the testing accuracy is greater than the training accuracy there is a high chance that the model is overfitted fu et al 2020 the model can be improved by reducing the bias and variance usually the best point is when both the bias and variance is low with the acceptable small gap between the training accuracy and testing accuracy in another words consider checking the class balance in training and testing data unbalanced data may cause the model s test result to be biased towards one class there are also some interesting points considering regarding regularization methods and dropout causing this behavior but in case of fig 9a and b the box plot trends give a good indication of how the values in the data are spread out they have the advantage of taking up less space which is useful when comparing distributions between many groups or datasets samsudin et al 2019 hence the variation appeared based on the data spread but not with regards to quantitative accuracy of the models 5 conclusion the study was explored the abilities of two evolutionary nonlinear input variable selection techniques gp and xgb coupled with a non tuned data intelligent model elm for modeling the wqi in kinta river basin malaysia for this purpose different trials were evaluated and the best one was chosen as the best combination the established modeling schema of the study was to use gp and xgb as a nonlinear selection tool in addition to using them as the main model or prediction models subsequently the selected inputs are entered into elm swlr and lr to assess the performance and compare them with the standalone models namely gp xgb elm swlr and lr following observations could be made from the comparison of the result the use of the elm model with all the variables exhibit identical performance with the lr the capacity of the elm model after selecting the important features by gp and xgb methods improves the performance of the prediction dramatically the use of lr after selecting the inputs deteriorates the prediction performance stepwise lr increases the performance of the model predictability without selecting the same inputs selected by gp and xgb gp and xgb methods can be successfully used as a selection tool in selecting the inputs especially in the existence of numerous features like the use of redundant information can deteriorate the performance the overall outcomes demonstrated that for modeling the wqi in kinta river basin malaysia the proposed computational intelligence techniques proved effective and satisfactory and hence can serve as a reliable prediction approach generally the overall results of the study reveal the advantages of the gp and xgb which can be successfully used as a selection tool in selecting the input variables in a highly nonlinear complex process furthermore the results also suggest that other data intelligence models need to be adopted for further improvements in the prediction of wqi furthermore using nature inspired algorithm in the process of selecting suitable input variables provides a more informative attributes for the prediction matrix abdulwahab et al 2019 melin et al 2013 salih 2019 salih and

from the department of environment doe malaysia and results are evaluated in terms of determination coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse the results demonstrated that the hybrid gpelm and xgbelm models outperformed the standalone gp xgb and elm models for the prediction of wqi at kinta river basin a comparison of the hybrid models showed that the predictive skill of gpelm rmse 3 441

water quality index watershed management extreme gradient boosting genetic programming extreme learning machine kinta river 1 introduction the continuous reduction in wq remained a top global concern especially in terms of industrial agricultural and domestic utilization several factors including geological weather hydrological industrial source such as textile laundry and pharmaceutical etc and natural phenomena physical processes have adverse effect on the quality of water abba and elkiran 2017 ke et al 2015 in literature water pollution is described as presence of detrimental substance s in water to the level that causes problems to living organisms therefore monitoring water features to ensure the quality of is of paramount importance mahmoodabadi and rezaei arshad 2018 wq can be considered as set of chemical physical and biological properties of water that can be utilized in forecasting the water quality sharma and kansal 2011 wq helps in determining the chemicals concentration in the water thus assessment of wq can be describe as the analysis chemical physical and biological properties of water in the literature several studies have been carried out in the area of water quality singh 2017 following this wqi provide a single parameter describing the water quality reducing the huge number of parameters to a simpler expression thereby making the monitoring and interpretation wq effortless gazzaz et al 2012 however wq is dependent on the ecosystem as well as human usages such as industrial pollution sewage and wastewater and both international and national agencies are committed to pollution control and wq analysis bharti 2011 factually there is no single variable can express the wq efficiently the wq is normally determined by measuring multiple wq parameters hameed et al 2017 for this purpose large amount of data is collected by the monitoring team which must be easily interpretable for decision makers and the general public in in this regard numerous wqis have been developed which are defined based on wq criteria and important parameters bharti 2011 wqi is a widely used measure in different parts of the world to solve problems of data management and to evaluate the successes as well as failures of management strategies for improving water quality while numerous indices are used in summarizing wq data to an understandable format wqi is derived from numerous water characterization parameters to signifies water quality level abbasi 2002 in essence general approach to computing wqi involve passing numerous water quality parameters into computable functions and logical expressions that rates the wellbeing of a water body with a solitary number castilla herná 2014 the computed value is then rated from very bad to excellent based on existing rating scale which is understandable in ascertaining wq by non technical water managers political decision makers and the general public abbasi 2002 over the decades various wqi have been defined globally these wqi help to represent the overall wq in that particular area efficiently including the united state national sanitation foundation wqi nsfwqi horton 1965 bharti 2011 the canadian council of ministers of the environment wqi ccmewqi sharma 2002 khan et al 2004 the british columbia water quality index bcwqi and oregon wqi owqi debels et al 2005 these indices are based on a comparison of the wq parameters to regulatory standards and give a single value to the water quality of a source abba et al 2019 despite the several paradigms that can be used to assess the quality of water malaysian department of environments doe approved the use of a unified water quality indices in 1974 for analysis and ranking the level of contamination and pollution of malaysian rivers this recommended adaptation of wqi is called the doe wqi and served as method of choice for calculating the wq index of local malaysian rivers gazzaz et al 2012 yaseen et al 2018a b c doe wqi gives a standard wq guidelines use to classify the wq of malaysian local rivers to five categories depending on their appropriateness for different usage including irrigation domestic supplies and fish culture water supply recreational use livestock drinking the application used for computing the water quality in malaysia is almost same as that employed in muhammad et al 2015 gazzaz et al 2012 yaseen et al 2018a b c however the analysis and calculation of this method generally requires significant amounts of time and effort which could lead to accidental errors during the sub index computations nevertheless the method has proved to be highly effective and successful in practice based on scientific fact for detailed manual calculation of the wq sub index for malaysia refer to hameed et al 2017 gazzaz et al 2012 recent research shows that there is exponential increase in the use of artificial intelligence ai which represents an alternative attractive quick and direct computing tool for water quality modeling tiyasha et al 2020 sahoo patra 2020 gaya et al 2020 yasin and karim 2020 karim and kamsani 2020 ai has the ability to minimize the error effort and computation time bhagat et al 2019 artificial neural network ann adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis and support vector regression svr are among the popular artificial intelligence modeling methods developed for highly complicated process and handling data nonlinearity barzegar et al 2016 however several researchers have employed different combinations of ai based models to predict the wqi wagener et al 2019 yaseen et al 2018b for example nourani et al 2013 proposed the application of an ann to monitor treated water quality the results indicated that ann has the potential to perform better than the conventional wq method emamgholizadeh et al 2014 applied ann and anfis models simultaneously to predict the wq variables of the karoon river water and the model results indicated the ann model have a better predictive ability compared to anfis based models in this regard barzegar et al 2016 investigated the performance of standalone ann and anfis and hybrid wavelet ann and wavelet anfis for the prediction of monthly averaged water salinity of aji chay river in northwest iran where the results showed that anfis performance was superior to ann hameed et al 2017 examined two different models viz radial basis function nn rbfnn and back propagation nn bpnn the results from both models shows the reliable performance with improved accuracy similarly ann model was employed to estimate the wqi at langat river basin malaysia and the outcomes was compared with the traditional multilinear regression analysis the obtained results demonstrated the effectiveness of the ann model for the prediction of wqi juahir et al 2004 gazzaz et al 2012 studied the potential of an ann model to predict the wqi in malaysia the results demonstrated that the ann model offered a reliable alternative to wqi computation and forecasting mohammadpour et al 2014 studied and compared the potential of support vector machine svm bpnn and rbfnn techniques to predict the wqi in a wetland for this purpose different wq variables at 17 monitoring points were evaluated the results showed that svm and ffbp outperformed rbf and therefore emerged as successful and reliable models for the prediction of wqi the outcomes also indicated that the methods can reliably reduce time and computational burdens more recently yaseen et al 2018a b c employed different types of ai based models to predict the wqi abba et al 2019 presented a performance comparison analysis of non linear models based on rbfnn and hammerstein weiner hw techniques and traditional linear modelling technique based on generalized linear regression glr and autoregressive integrated moving average arima for agra station of yamuna river india and kinta river in malaysia the simulation results established that the non linear models outperformed the other models based on the above literature it is evident that studies in the field of wq and wqi conducted around the world have shown the reliability of computational intelligence models tiyasha et al 2020 although there is a significant increase in the use of ai models in the field of wqi prediction yet many standalone ai models produce unsatisfactory results due to some related limitations to the identification of the appropriate input parameters or the selection of the internal models parameters particularly in applications involving very dynamic hydrological processes hence to alleviate the aforementioned shortcomings it is mandatory to develop an appropriate structure and to have a proper selection technique of the suitable variables this has been proven to be significantly influential in the prediction ability for complex non linear processes in order to provide a reliable alternative to manual wq computation hence the objective of this study is to investigate the potential of xgb and gp in obtaining the feature importance and then the abstracted inputs are used in the predictive model i e elm for comparison purpose the proposed models are compared with the stand alone schema where the optimum combination of input variables are applied to the xgb gp elm and linear regression lr models the primary motivation behind the current study is to explore the abilities of the gp and xgb approaches for choosing the most dominant related variables in this regard hybrid models are established to increase the prediction accuracy of the non tuned data intelligent models for mimicking the river wq pattern however it is important to mention that since the development of this new algorithm to the best of the authors knowledge no research or technical literature has been published in respect of application of xgb in wqi prediction and as an essential method of input selection because of its distinctive and outstanding features this study used xgb algorithm in both input selection and wqi modelling the remaining sections of the paper are arranged as follows section 2 presents the applied methodology for single model and proposed modeling schema adopted in the study section 3 described the case study and the data description while the application of result and analysis are given in section 4 and the paper ends with a conclusion in section 5 2 applied methodology 2 1 extreme gradient boosting xgb the xgb algorithm has lately been dominating supervised machine learning applications such as regression and classification pradhan and sameen 2020 it is an improvement of the gradient boosting technique introduced by friedman 2001 it possesses the salient features of gradient tree boosting methods such as computational efficiency high processing ability and learning speed it uses a more precise approximation to find the best decision tree model to achieve a higher speed and better performance it is generally more than ten times faster than the conventional gradient boosting technique chen and guestrin 2016 xgb is an ensemble technique like random forests this algorithm is attributed to the set of classification and regression trees cart as it differs from decision tree dt in that each of the leaves has a real score that helps in richer interpretation that beyond the classification which is the case in dt in cart a single tree is used which is incapable and weak to some extent hence an ensemble of multiple trees is proposed hadi et al 2019 xiong et al 2007 however although xgb has been implemented in a wide range of applications for example stream flow hadi et al 2019 yu et al 2020 shear strength zhang et al 2020 and heat transfer qian et al 2020 the use of the algorithm in wqi prediction in general and as a reliable means of input parameter selection with wavelet remain unexplored in the literature for this purpose and given the excellent features of this algorithm it is used in this work for both the modelling and input selection processes the ensemble of k trees for xi i e wq variables inputs dataset to forecast yi i e wqi target can be expressed mathematically see eq 1 1 y k 1 k f k x i f k f where f k is a function in a set of all likely function in carts f the set of these functions optimization is the major objective of this function as presented in eq 2 chen et al 2019 is 2 o b j θ i 1 n l y i y i i 1 t ω f i where l is the regularization function used to avoid overfitting and ω is the training loss function a unary function is considered during the training as it is difficult to train with all the functions simultaneously f i hence representing the prediction value at step t as y i t leads to chen et al 2019 3 y i t k 1 t f k x i y i t 1 f t x i upon substituting the forecasted values given by eq 3 the tree that minimizes the objective function eq 4 is added to accomplish the performance of each iteration considering mean squared error as the loss function the cost function can be expressed as chen et al 2015 4 obj t i 1 n y i y i t 1 f t x i 2 i 1 t ω f i which can also be in the form of eq 5 chen et al 2015 5 obj t i 1 n 2 y i t 1 y i f t x i f t x i 2 ω f t c o n s t a n t mostly a second order taylor s expansion is used due to the fact that logistic functions have a tendency of becoming complicated as expressed in eq 6 chen et al 2015 6 obj t i 1 n l y i y i t 1 g i f t x i 1 2 h i f t x i 2 ω f t c o n s t a n t where g i y i t 1 l y i y i t 1 and h i y i t 1 2 l y i y i t 1 the tree can be described by f t x w q x while the regularization function is expressed in eq 7 7 ω f γ t 1 2 λ j 1 t w j 2 therein t is the total number of trees and q represents the scores on the leaves that is used to assign the function of every data point to corresponding leaf by eliminating the constants from eq 7 the objective function can be rewritten as in eq 8 8 obj t i 1 n g i w q x i 1 2 h i w q x i 2 γ t 1 2 λ j 1 t w j 2 j 1 t i i i g i w j 1 2 i i i h i λ w j 2 γ t where i i i q x i j refers to the jth leaf data index defining g j i i i g i and h j i i i h i one can write the objective function as in eq 9 9 obj t j 1 t g j w j 1 2 h j λ w j 2 γ t hence for any tree structure q x the performance can be obtained by using the best w j and objective functions see eq 10 and 11 respectively 10 w j g j h j λ 11 obj 1 2 j 1 t g j h j λ γ t moreover eq 12 is employed for optimization of the both the score gain and the tree in splitting a leaf into two 12 gain 1 2 g l 2 h l λ g r 2 h r λ g l g r 2 h l h r λ γ in eq 12 r and l indicate the score on new right and left leaves on the original leaves and the regularization terms if a branch gain is less such branch is dropped from the tree this algorithm is employed in obtaining the feature importance 2 2 extreme learning machine elm the elm is a novel ffnn with a single hidden layer it was first introduced and named by huang et al 2006 elm was invented to eliminate the over fitting and sluggish training speed issues attributed to the classical ffnn algorithms in this method a special least square solution based on the moore penrose inverse function is used to obtain the weights between the output layer and the hidden layer while the bias of the hidden neurons and the weight between the hidden layer and the input layer are randomly initialized yaseen et al 2016 the randomly initialized hidden neurons remain fixed elm can efficiently achieve a globally optimal solution because of its universal approximation abilities huang et al 2006 huang et al 2015 in recent years several researchers have used the elm method in many areas of hydrological modelling owing to its robustness and high precision in streamflow prediction as in yaseen et al 2019 the elm model was developed using a training data set x 1 y 1 x t y t in this context the input vector denoted as x 1 x 2 x t are defined as the wq variables and the output vector y 1 y 2 y t represents the observed wqi mathematically for n training sets t 1 2 n where x t r d and y t r an slfn with h hidden nodes is given by huang et al 2006 as in eq 13 13 i 1 h b i g i α i x t β i z t where i is index of the hidden layer node α i and β i represent the weight and bias of the randomized layers and d indicates the number of inputs similarly b r h g α β x and z z t r are the predicted weights of the output layer hidden layer neurons activation function and model output respectively the sigmoid function is found to be the best activation function for this study yaseen et al 2020 see eq 14 14 g x 1 1 e x p x linear activation function is employed in output layer as illustrated in eq 15 for elm models the error can be reduced to zero by selecting the appropriate number of hidden neurons randomized hidden layer biases β and input layer weights α hence the weights of output layer may be found as huang et al 2006 15 t 1 n z t y t 0 system of linear equations is used to find the value of b for any given input output training samples is expressed in eq 16 16 y g b where g is expressed in eq 17 17 g α β x g x 1 g x n g 1 α 1 x 1 β 1 g l w h x 1 β h g 1 α n x n β 1 g l w h x n β f n h and b is expressed in eq 18 18 b b 1 t b h t h 1 and y is expressed in eq 19 19 y y 1 t y n t n 1 where g denotes the output of the hidden layer b can be estimated using moore penrose inverse function by inverting the hidden layer matrix see eq 20 20 b g y lastly the estimated y which represent the predicted wqi for this study can be obtained as in eq 21 21 y i 1 h b i g i α i x t β i 2 3 genetic programming gp gp is one of the state of the art machine learning algorithms that works on the basis of darwinian s evolution theory igwe and pillay 2014 gp varies from traditional regression techniques as it simply involves the determination of numerical coefficients for a function with a pre specified structure olyaie et al 2017 on the one hand gp optimizes both the parameters and structure of an input output map contrary to neural networks nns user tuning is not required in developing gp based models danandeh mehr et al 2013 in the gp technique solutions are denoted as evolutionary parsing trees where the primary population is randomly generated however successive generations are obtained with the help of basic genetic operators crossover mutation and selection reproduction peirovi minaee et al 2019 gp has been effectively implemented to solve several problems in the fields of image processing feedback control systems electronic circuits computer vision and data classification amongst others 2 4 linear regression lr the traditional lr can be categorized into simple regression which is used to estimate a single predictor and a single criterion variable and multiple regression which involves the estimations of more than one predictor but still with a single criterion variable for this study multiple regression analysis is used which is also called multilinear regression analysis according to chen and liu 2015 the multilinear regression model is the most widely used type of linear regression and involves an analysis whereby each value from the independent variables is related to a dependent variable value the lr used in this study can be expressed as in eq 22 22 y b 0 b 1 x 1 b 2 x 2 b i x i where x 1 is the value of the ith predictor b 0 is the regression constant and b i is the coefficient of the ith predictor 2 5 step wise linear regression swlr regression analysis appeared to be the frequently used exploratory approach in citing dependencies between the two categories of variables i e dependent and independent while expressing dependencies between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables it is paramount to find the optimum set of the variables that provide best prediction accuracy with respect to the dependent variable yasar et al 2012 according to çevik 2007 described the stepwise regression as a forward selection process which select the optimum set of independent variables through addition or deletion of the variable variables with the greatest influence on the residual sum of squares swlr follows stepwise refinement of the variable s by rechecking the importance of previously added variables based on their partial sum of squares when the partial sum of squares for any recently added variable s does not satisfy a base rule to remain in the models the selection strategy is changed to deletion state and that variables are discarded gradually until every remaining variable meet the base rule yasar et al 2012 the concept of stepwise could be established using multiple linear regression as expressed in eq 22 all the independent variables x i are entered into the regression equation one by one in accordance with their influence on the dependent variable y when each independent variable is entered a series of t tests are conducted for selected variables one by one in order to retain the statistically significant independent variables wu et al 2020 zhang and chang 2016 the process of entering or removing an independent variable from the regression equation e g eq 22 is a step of the stepwise regression it also performs the significance test using the f test at each step if it is passed the t test results of each variable in the equation are checked until the p value is less than 0 10 this process is repeated until no significant independent variables are entered into or removed from the regression equation from there an optimized regression equation could be obtained lachniet and patterson 2006 2 6 proposed modeling schema the main objective of the study is to find a tool for selecting inputs to improve the prediction of the wqi therefore the schema of the study is to use gp and xgb as a nonlinear selection tool in addition to using them as the main model or prediction model afterwards the selected inputs are to be entered into elm and lr to assess their performance and compare them with the standalone models gp xgb elm and lr in detail the methodology of the study is that the data was firstly normalized by using the following equation see eq 23 23 n x x m i n x max x m i n x where nx is the normalized value x is the original value and x is all the values of the variable the normalized variables were entered directly into the used techniques gp xgb elm lr and swlr and this schema was called the standalone schema secondly another schema is proposed based on the advantages of the gp and xgb models in obtaining the feature importance and that schema is used to select only the most important features which contribute in the prediction of the wqi and impose them into elm and lr a visualization of the methodology is shown in fig 1 these two schemas are compared in order to obtain the advantage of selecting the inputs and the ability of gp and xgb in selecting the inputs several parameters need to be considered in the modeling process in each of the used techniques the gp model was run many times to find the best parameters and particularly the best tree length and depth the best mutation probability generation population size was found to be 15 1000 and 1000 respectively after fixing these parameters tree length and depth were also tuned by trial and error for the xgb grid tuning was used to obtain the best values of several parameters such as maximum tree depth eta and gamma in the elm technique 1 to 150 hidden neuron numbers were used and the best is obtained by an algorithm that compares determination coefficient r2 and root mean square error rmse of each one and the best performed hidden neuron was chosen three evaluation measurements metrics were used namely r2 and rmse mean absolute percentage error mape ehteram et al 2020

about 100 km within kinta district it supports farming activities residential areas and industries fig 2 across its three subdivisions i e upstream undulating and downstream on the other hand stations 2pk34 and 2pk25 are the center of the river at the upstream there are stations 2pk22 2pk24 and stations 2pk55 and 2pk19 are the downstream kinta river is largely utilized for forestry and recreation along the upstream the densely populated ipoh city is located at the center of the river characterized by commercial and industrial activities kinta river dam constructed in the year 2000 with an attempt to raise the supply of perak by around 25 is the most important and second most important source of water to ipoh and perak respectively it has a daily production capacity of 639 000 m3 which is expected to be sufficient for kinta valley until 2020 ghani et al 2007 gazzaz et al 2012 according to doe malaysia 120 of the 189 rivers are monitored and controlled four decades ago wqi was the recommended water pollution assessment and ranking index by the doe along the rivers based on an approach named opinion poll wqi op wqi for calculating the water quality index of the local rivers doe estimates showed that 44 5 are clean rivers 48 4 are slightly polluted and 7 1 are polluted nonetheless rainfall as the main source of water contribute 96 water supply to all kinds of surface water bodies i e channels rivers impoundment and reservoirs ghani et al 2007 gazzaz et al 2012 the measured water quality data was obtained from doe malaysia for 12 years period between 2002 and 2013 with 301 instances the data was recorded from several monitoring stations located on the kinta river malaysia the wq parameters are ss do bod cod temperature temp total solids ts ph and wqi from the complete data 75 is used for training while 25 is set for testing the models the statistical description of the data is given in table 1 despite there are other important wq parameters but the available parameters selected for the purposed of this research were considered as the one of the most dominants parameters in the determination of wqi as confirmed by other several studies such as muhammad et al 2015 gazzaz et al 2012 yaseen et al 2018a b c in addition selecting these parameters was based on the non linear input variables selection approach which is according the most sensitive to the target variables it should note that another feasible alternative could also be used with regards to selection approach however the proposed modeling schema could also be applicable in modeling other important parameters from table 1 the terms xmin xmax xm xmean sx and csx denote minimum maximum median mean standard deviation and skewness the wq parameters show variability trends in terms of the maximum and minimum values the wqi from 43 to 96 mg l do concentration varies from 0 28 to 9 93 mg l high values of wq parameters indicate that the kinta river receives significant non biodegradable organic matter which is due to the excessive anthropogenic activities in the recent years that significantly contribute to water pollution zhu and heddam 2019 characterized the wq of huaxi and yipin river as being polluted with do 2 9 10 and do 5 2 10 5 respectively according to elkiran et al 2019 partially treated and untreated domestic and industrial wastewaters discharged into the river could lead to low do concentration according to danandeh mehr et al 2013 and olyaie et al 2017 a very high csx can affect the performance of ai ann considerably while a low csx is more appropriate for modelling the variation pattern of the wq parameters confirms the non linear and complicated process of modeling do concentration both mean and median indicated where the centre of the data is located it can be seen in table 1 that the values of mean are slightly larger than the median this indicated the positive direction of skewness with regards to mean values according litosseliti 2010 the mean is best for un skewed data with no outliers while the median can tolerate skew and outlier s data similarly the validation of the datasets was conducted using k fold cross validation the main aim of validation is to fit the model to the given dataset to obtain a reliable and accurate prediction on the datasets for this purpose in the k fold cross validation the training and the validation datasets are independent this advantage makes this method promising with a sound foundation for optimizing the model the k fold cross validation approach has been widely implemented in various hydro environmental studies even though other feasible alternatives may also be used tsioptsias et al 2016 4 application results and analysis the accuracy of intelligent models is affected by the use of numerous inputs several inputs selection methods have been reported in hydro environmental literatures popular among them includes correlation auto correlation and principal components analysis nevertheless these methods are frequently used for input output linear relationships hadi and tombul 2018 this study employed two novel nonlinear input variables selection tools gp and xgb for choosing the most dominant related inputs to the targeted variable to improve the accuracy of the models prediction after that the appropriately selected inputs are entered into non tuned data intelligence and regression models to assess their performance in comparison with the standalone models gp xgb elm lr and swlr the period used is sufficient to ensure the profile information of the kinta river fig 3 shows further analysis to indicate the direction and strength of association between the various stations via correlation matrix for any computational intelligence techniques it is essential to assess the correlation coefficient between the wq variables the correlation coefficient indicated the association between the selected stations and illustrate the proportionality relations between the dependent and the independent variables 4 1 results of gp and gpelm this section demonstrates the results of running the gp standalone and hybrid elm gpelm model table 2 only shows several important trials to save some space according to table 2 the best performing trial was trial 2 with a tree length of 20 and a tree depth of 100 which is also very close to trial 3 in terms of performance with regard to complexity trial 3 is the best as three input variables were excluded from the model while in trial 2 only two were excluded and that reduces the complexity and due to the difference in the performance between the two trials trial 3 was chosen as the overall best the relevance in terms of importance of the features for the trials is also extracted and not only for the best model but in order to get the full image of the importance and prove the real importance of these features table 3 shows the obtained results according to table 2 trial 3 with a combination of do bod ts and cod has the highest performance accuracy in terms of model complexity regarding the performance accuracy of the trials 2 and 3 trial 2 outperformed trial 3 with slight increment in goodness of fit for both training and testing phases furthermore the direct comparison of the trials clearly demonstrated that trial 2 to trial 6 achieved the best prediction skills and hence emerged as reliable combinations for the prediction of wqi at kinta river a goodness of fit criteria value equal 1 signifies a perfect estimation but generally a model with goodness of fit 0 7 is acceptable shukla et al 2008 it is evident from table 2 that r2 values of trial 2 6 in this study 0 7 the variables are sorted according to the mean of their relevance importance after determining the importance of the inputs from the best model of the gp shown in the table 4 only these variables are entered into the elm in the same order of their importance table 4 shows that the importance is not proportional to the correlation for example bod has a higher correlation with wqi than ts while the opposite is correct in terms of the importance as ts has higher importance than bod ph also has a higher correlation than cod ph is not even entered in the prediction of the wqi as its importance is 0 this is due to the fact that the correlation is a linear index that only explains the linear relation between the dependent and independent variables while in reality the relation between them is not linear the degree of importance of the inputs of both xgb and gp schemas is presented in fig 4 it can be seen from fig 4 that temp ph and ss have zero importance according to the gp input selection approach in other words adding these variables has no or negligible impact on the prediction accuracy in the estimation of wqi although several studies such as ji et al 2017 elkiran 2018 and shi et al 2019 reported that temp and ph are among the significant wq variables they are considered to be insignificant when using evolutionary input selection approach in this study the results of the gpelm model in which only the selected variables are entered into the elm model are shown in table 5 and the best gp and elm models results are also listed in order to compare them according to table 5 the gpelm has higher performance and the training and test subsets are very close while there is a significant difference between them in the gp model and this could be due to the tree nature of the gp model which leads to overfitting a visual comparison between the three computational intelligence techniques shows the accurate performances in terms of rmse and r2 it can be vividly seen that integrating gp with the elm model exhibits the highest performance in the prediction of wqi also the numerical results indicated that for the forecasting of wqi at kinta river gpelm with r2 0 908 and rmse 3 484 values in the testing phase was demonstrated to have excellent prediction skills in comparison to gp and elm and therefore emerged as a reliable model fig 5 a c present the scatter and time series plots for the observed vs predicted wqi in the testing phase it is clear from the figure that the best predictive model is gpelm in which the prediction array was closer with the observed wqi another quantitative investigation of the results with reference to r2 and rmse in the testing phase depicted that the gpelm model increased by r2 21 and r2 56 and decreased by rmse 16 and rmse 9 compared to gp and elm models during the testing stage respectively 4 2 results of xgb and xgbelm xgb was tuned for finding the best parameter by using grid tuning several parameters were tuned in which multiple models were created and to save space only the important trials are listed in table 6 xgb hyper tuning techniques were implemented in order to achieve the optimum values of these parameters that lead to the best results from table 6 trial 3 was chosen as the best trial with its parameters as it has the highest r2 0 877 for the test subset and has the lowest rmse 4 062 for training and testing subsets after choosing the best tuned model the importance matrix of the features inputs or dependent variables are also extracted as listed in table 4 the inputs after that are entered into the elm according to their order in the importance matrix as proposed by hadi et al 2019 the results showed that the use of only the first four features in the importance matrix do bod cod and ts obtains the best results and that is therefore identified as the best model the results of the best xgb and best xgbelm model are shown in table 7 although the xgb model has not received any attention in do prediction this model has proved to be effective in streamflow prediction hadi et al 2019 according to the presented results xgb combinations do bod cod and ts demonstrated the prediction skill with r2 0 933 and rmse 3 036 for training phase and r2 0 877 and rmse 4 062 for testing phase the predictability performance of xgb is therefore not surprising owing to it significant accuracy in hadi et al 2019 fig 6 a c show scatter plots between the observed and predicted values of the xgb elm and xgbelm from the figure it is clear that a closeness agreement between the observed and predicted values was attained the overall comparison of the computational intelligence techniques indicates the satisfactory performance accuracy of gp elm xgbgp and xgbelm models in both training and testing phases which can be justified by considering the correlation coefficient cc 0 7 according to legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 and zhu and heddam 2019 cc values higher than 0 70 are considered acceptable thus the results of all four models are acceptable the numerical predictive accuracy of the models was also evaluated and the outcomes showed that gpelm and xgbelm yielded the best performance accuracy compared to the other single models although gp and xgb slightly outperformed the two hybrid models in some statistical indices the hybrid models are considered the most reliable based on the agreement between training and testing phases detailed investigation for predicting wqi at kinta river reveals that the model that obtains the best accuracy in the training phase may not necessarily represent as the best model in addition the impact of various wq variables on wqi is different this leads to the conclusion that the models that benefit from both the training and testing phases such as gpelm and xgbelm are capable of capturing the highly complex and nonlinear relationship generally in hydro environmental studies there are several factors that affect the predictive accuracy of the models however potential factor affecting the accuracy in this study could certainly be the low correlation coefficient between wqi and ph temp and ss another reason could be due to the pollution increase caused by anthropogenic activities on the banks of the river which drastically reduce the accuracy of the models this statement is in line with the conclusion drawn by zhu and heddam 2019 the study conducted by ji et al 2017 also proved that there is a significant correlation between the do wq parameters except for temp the comparison of hybrid models depicted that the predictive skill of gpelm rmse 3 441 and rmse 3 484 over xgbelm rmse 3 606 and rmse 3 816 thus improving its accuracy by decreasing the values of rmse by 5 and 9 for training and testing respectively 4 3 results of linear regression linear regression was also used in this study as another model for comparison with the proposed models as a benchmark the linear regression was firstly used with all variables as inputs secondly stepwise linear regression swlr was used in order to obtain the best results by choosing only the important variables and thirdly the variables selected by the gp and xgb were entered to check the performance of the linear prediction of these variables the evaluation measurements of the three models are shown in table 8 according to the results the swlr model has the highest performance in comparison with the other models the model of gp or xgb with lr in which the inputs selected by gp and xgb is entered into the lr has the worst performance the swlr excluded ph temp and ts as they have no significance in the prediction as shown in table 9 this exclusion increased the performance of the model in comparison with the model that used all the variables as inputs in the model that used the inputs selected by gp xgb in which ss ph and temp were excluded the performance also deteriorated dramatically although all the variables were significant according to table 9 it is important to mention that the use of elm alone has a very similar performance to the lr by including all the variables but using them as the second step in the model after selecting the inputs elm increased the performance dramatically while for lr it dramatically decreased the performance this is due to several reasons the linear and non linear nature of the gp and xgb in obtaining the importance of the features which is used in the selection of the inputs the elm non linear prediction capability in comparison with the lr which is only linear and most of the non linear relationships cannot be revealed although regressions are often proposed as a reference model when combined with computational intelligence they still provide satisfactory results the performance of linear regression could be decreased for problems involving complex processes as shown in table 8 gp xgblr are inferior to the lr and swlr in terms of predicting wqi values negligible changes were observed between lr and swlr in both training and testing fig 7 a c present the scatter and time series plots lr gp xgblr and swlr for the observed and predicted values in the testing phase based on the visual examination of the predicted and observed wqi values during the testing stage the prediction made by lr and swlr are closer to the observed wqi than those made by gp xgblr further examination of the graph shows that with respect to goodness of fit r2 0 850 and statistical error rmse 0 4074 in the testing phase swlr outperformed the other two models in term of prediction skills another pertinent conclusion can be made from scatter plots obtained through lr gp xgblr and swlr in the testing phase denotes the ideal results in line 1 1 in particular the closer the data points are to this line the better the result produced by the model ji et al 2017 yaseen et al 2019 the comparison of the predictive accuracies of all the models is illustrated by using a radar chart radar charts are essential in models performance comparison because of its clarity and ability to show the tips of the variable scores in the dataset in this study radar charts are used in terms of cc for both the training and testing stages fig 8 shows the radar chart illustrating the various cc values for all the models it is observed from fig 8 that the cc values in the training and testing phases are 0 959 0 941 for gp 0 965 0 936 for xgb 0 955 0 952 for gpelm 0 951 0 953 for xgbelm 0 913 0 923 for elm 0 914 0 956 for lr 0 886 0 941 for gp xgblr and 0 914 0 956 for swlr moreover box plots were used to demonstrate how close the comparisons of all the model s predictions are between the observed and predicted wqi as shown in fig 9 the level of overall spread in the observed and forecasted values can be inferred from the various whiskers and quartiles according to the graph the spread of gpelm and xgbelm meticulously resembles the observed wqi the exploratory analysis for all the models can be better pictured through the boxplots in fig 9 boxplots are a powerful graphical representation of data that provide an overview and a statistical summary of a data set samsudin et al 2019 according to fig 8 the closest of all the models to the observed values is selected to be the best model based on the mean value the plot contained box and whisker median mean and staples the extent of the spread values between the observed and predicted models indicates that the hybrid models gpelm and xgbelm emerged as the best among all the models as ai models are used such models try to map the data by the training phase as much as they can but in the testing phase as these data are not shown to the model they behave different and that is inherited property to the ai models also for data intelligence algorithms when the testing accuracy is greater than the training accuracy there is a high chance that the model is overfitted fu et al 2020 the model can be improved by reducing the bias and variance usually the best point is when both the bias and variance is low with the acceptable small gap between the training accuracy and testing accuracy in another words consider checking the class balance in training and testing data unbalanced data may cause the model s test result to be biased towards one class there are also some interesting points considering regarding regularization methods and dropout causing this behavior but in case of fig 9a and b the box plot trends give a good indication of how the values in the data are spread out they have the advantage of taking up less space which is useful when comparing distributions between many groups or datasets samsudin et al 2019 hence the variation appeared based on the data spread but not with regards to quantitative accuracy of the models 5 conclusion the study was explored the abilities of two evolutionary nonlinear input variable selection techniques gp and xgb coupled with a non tuned data intelligent model elm for modeling the wqi in kinta river basin malaysia for this purpose different trials were evaluated and the best one was chosen as the best combination the established modeling schema of the study was to use gp and xgb as a nonlinear selection tool in addition to using them as the main model or prediction models subsequently the selected inputs are entered into elm swlr and lr to assess the performance and compare them with the standalone models namely gp xgb elm swlr and lr following observations could be made from the comparison of the result the use of the elm model with all the variables exhibit identical performance with the lr the capacity of the elm model after selecting the important features by gp and xgb methods improves the performance of the prediction dramatically the use of lr after selecting the inputs deteriorates the prediction performance stepwise lr increases the performance of the model predictability without selecting the same inputs selected by gp and xgb gp and xgb methods can be successfully used as a selection tool in selecting the inputs especially in the existence of numerous features like the use of redundant information can deteriorate the performance the overall outcomes demonstrated that for modeling the wqi in kinta river basin malaysia the proposed computational intelligence techniques proved effective and satisfactory and hence can serve as a reliable prediction approach generally the overall results of the study reveal the advantages of the gp and xgb which can be successfully used as a selection tool in selecting the input variables in a highly nonlinear complex process furthermore the results also suggest that other data intelligence models need to be adopted for further improvements in the prediction of wqi furthermore using nature inspired algorithm in the process of selecting suitable input variables provides a more informative attributes for the prediction matrix abdulwahab et al 2019 melin et al 2013 salih 2019 salih and

5416,the flow duration curve fdc is widely used for river management operations such as hydropower percentile flows of the fdc express the percent of time a flow is equaled or exceeded and often need to be predicted for ungauged basins regression models are commonly used to predict percentile flows however a major challenge of this approach is selecting basin characteristics to serve as independent variables the number of basin characteristics precludes an analysis of all possible models thus a subset of models are typically evaluated using an automated regression procedure like stepwise regression or the more exhaustive branch and bound approach the latter was used as a baseline approach in this study and was compared to six other less commonly used methods from the field of variable feature selection the performance of all seven approaches was evaluated based on percentile flow regression models developed for a large sample of 918 basins in the united states the baseline regression procedure only outperformed principal component analysis the only method that did not use the percentile flows to select variables of the variable selection methods that used the percentile flows the regression procedure performed the worst this suggests that regression procedures should not be the first choice among variable selection methods for developing percentile flow regression models variables selected based on knowledge of the fdc performed nearly as well as the best overall data based method i e random forests random forests and other methods that performed well emphasized the influence of geology on percentile flows a geologic variable i e baseflow index had the largest effect on predictive performance all of the models suffered from large predictive error and future work should apply a regional approach that groups similar basins to predict percentile flows keywords flow duration curve ungauged basin regression variable selection united states 1 introduction the flow duration curve fdc is a widely used tool for managing rivers the percent of time a flow is equaled or exceeded i e percentile flow is a component of the fdc that supplies essential information for river applications such as hydropower wastewater treatment and water abstractions vogel and fennessey 1995 however gauged flow data is normally not available to calculate percentile flows in this case methods are used to transfer percentile flows from gauged basins to ungauged basins regression models are a simple and common method to predict percentile flows see the united states us geological survey streamstats application summarized in ries et al 2017 the method is founded on the idea that climatic and physical basin characteristics influence the fdc and therefore can be used as independent variables in percentile flow regression models a major challenge of this method is selecting independent variables among many possible basin characteristics the number of basin characteristics has grown due to advances in geographic information systems and remote sensing a database in the us called geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii gages ii has over 300 basin characteristics falcone 2011 studies to predict percentile flows and other streamflow statistics have used 251 different basin characteristics as independent variables ssegane et al 2012 given the number of independent variables it is not possible to evaluate all models formed from every combination of variables a study using only 40 independent variables surpasses a trillion possible models i e 240 1 for this reason many studies evaluate a subset of models using automated regression procedures e g eash and barnes 2017 hsu and huang 2017 painter et al 2017 despite their frequent use automated regression procedures are widely criticized in the field of statistics see copas 1983 flom and cassell 2007 harrell 2001 for criticisms automated regression procedures are known to produce biased model parameters and as a result often underperform on new data in model validation alternative approaches do not use regression and select variables according to 1 knowledge of the dependent variable or 2 data based methods from the field of feature selection 1 1 knowledge based variable selection knowledge based variable selection uses a conceptual understanding of the dependent variable to select independent variables a conceptual understanding can be developed based on the literature although this can be subjective a small number of carefully selected independent variables is recommended for regression modeling see harrell 2001 among others a similar recommendation for ungauged basin model development suggests that independent variables should be carefully selected to reflect the processes that influence streamflow castellarin et al 2013 in doing so models may be less specific to a particular dataset and more transferable to ungauged basins the fdc has a strong physical underpinning vogel and fennessey 1995 geographic variation of the fdc is tied to the water balance yaeger et al 2012 topographic setting ye et al 2012 and geology cheng et al 2012 of a region a modeling study yokoo and sivapalan 2011 decomposed the fdc into 1 high flows contributed by surface runoff during storm events with a loss factor for infiltration 2 average flows reflecting long term storage conditions influenced by climate and geology and 3 low flows supplied by groundwater in the dry season subject to evapotranspiration losses this information can be used to select independent variables associated with the fdc 1 2 data based variable selection data based variable selection methods are developed in the field of feature selection to reduce large datasets for modeling purposes feature selection can be broadly categorized into methods that 1 control for redundant cross correlated independent variables and 2 select a subset of variables based on a specified relation to the dependent variable the former treats cross correlated independent variables multicollinearity to address possible model instability on new data dormann et al 2013 treating multicollinearity can involve deriving new latent variables that reduce cross correlation or screening variables based on cross correlation a disadvantage of these methods is that they do not use information from the dependent variable in addition multicollinearity may not be a concern for predictions harrell 2001 if the model data represents systematic relations between variables that also occur in new data e g snowfall varies with elevation a subset of independent variables can be selected based on a mathematical relation to the dependent variable the mathematical relation may express the independent variable s explanatory power or probabilistic association with the dependent variable a variable s explanatory power is evaluated according to its effect on model performance models are evaluated by excluding one variable at a time breiman 2001 or a training algorithm can be used to screen variables that do not contribute to model performance koza 1994 these methods are however prone to including irrelevant variables due to simpson s 1951 paradox a condition in which a relevant variable becomes irrelevant in the presence of another variable methods that evaluate probabilistic relations to the dependent variable are effective at filtering irrelevant independent variables pearl 2014 probabilistic relations are evaluated based on the conditional probability that an observed outcome flow changes in the presence of another set of variables e g the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration changes the probability of observing a particular flow the present study compares a typical automated regression procedure to six other less widely used variable selection methods on a large sample of 918 basins for more generalizable results the objectives of this study were to 1 develop regression models to predict percentile flows for ungauged basins in the us and 2 evaluate the performance of different variable selection methods for developing the regression models other modeling approaches such as artificial neural networks may be applied to predict percentile flows however these approaches also require variable selection the choice of a modeling approach is unlikely to change the relative performance of different variable selection methods therefore regression models were applied here as a simple and widely used approach the study addresses the following research question how should independent variables be selected for the regression modeling of fdc percentile flows a hypothesis is that a small number of carefully selected independent variables may perform similar to evaluating many independent variables in a data based approach because multicollinearity is common among independent variables kroll and song 2013 and the fdc can be decomposed into only three distinct physical components yokoo and sivapalan 2011 2 methods 2 1 basins the study used 918 basins in the gages ii database falcone 2011 classified as near natural with little development each basin had to have 30 years of continuous daily streamflow record to calculate percentile flows see the next section the basins were split into 734 calibration basins and 184 validation basins fig 1 meeting a recommendation that model validation should be conducted with at least 100 samples harrell 2001 validation basins were selected at random within groups based on köppen climate classes peel et al 2007 three major rock types reed and bush 2005 and drainage area the result facilitated a proxy basin test klemeš 1986 in which the calibration and validation basins had similar physiographic conditions table 1 a cross validation approach in which small samples of the data are iteratively excluded from model development could have been applied but was not required given the large calibration and validation sample sizes which generally produce stable results harrell 2001 the calibration and validation samples share similar statistical distributions which should suppress the effect of multicollinearity on predictions harrell 2001 2 2 percentile flows percentile flows were calculated using 30 years of daily streamflow data to generate stable streamflow statistics for different time periods kennard et al 2010 the weibull plotting position was used to calculate the probability of a flow being equaled or exceeded as follows 1 p r n 1 100 where p is the exceedance probability of a flow with rank r in decreasing order among n flow observations other equations may be used to calculate the exceedance probability but are known to generate similar results for large records of n 100 sadegh et al 2016 a total of 13 percentile flows were calculated at intervals of ten percent from q 10 q 90 extreme high flows q 1 and q 5 and extreme low flows q 95 and q 99 each percentile flow was normalized divided by the mean of nonzero flows to compare basins with different flow magnitudes hope and bart 2011 2 3 independent variables the independent variables are described in table 2 a review of the literature on fdc prediction and data covering the contiguous us was conducted to select a representative array of independent variables including climatic topographic land cover soil and geologic basin characteristics climatic characteristics were derived from monthly data during the same time periods as the streamflow data except for daily precipitation variables which used a 30 year time period from 1981 to 2010 because daily data was not available for all streamflow time periods the time period of 1981 2010 was used because it overlapped with streamflow data from the most basins the percent of precipitation delivered as snow is a gages ii variable calculated using long term data from 1901 to 2000 forest cover was used to summarize land cover due to cross correlation among land cover classes and the noted effect of forest cover on the fdc brown et al 2013 geology was represented using the baseflow index i e the percent of streamflow from groundwater a strong indicator of basin geology price 2011 useful for predicting the fdc in prior studies see castellarin et al 2013 eash and barnes 2017 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the baseflow index was calculated using streamflow data at gauged locations and interpolated into a grid for ungauged streamflow predictions wolock 2003 both non transformed and natural log transformed independent variables were used in variable selection methods independent variables were converted to z scores i e number of standard deviations from the mean for variable selection methods sensitive to variables on different scales i e principal component analysis symbolic regression and bayesian networks 2 4 variable selection methods the independent variables were selected for percentile flow regression models using a number of methods a summary of each method follows with references that cover the method in more depth because methods may select a different number of variables each method was applied in a way that supplied the top five variables the different methods could then be compared for constructing percentile flow regression models again in the interest of comparing variable selection methods regression models were not developed for sub regions as in some other studies see tsakiris et al 2011 for example 2 4 1 automated regression procedure an automated regression procedure served as the baseline approach commonly used in percentile flow regression modeling studies a branch and bound procedure was used in lieu of stepwise regression because it conducts a more exhaustive search of all possible models to do so the branch and bound procedure applies the logic that adding an independent variable should improve the fit of the model if a variable is added and model fit is not improved then the branch of models including that variable is eliminated see miller 2002 for a more in depth review model fit was evaluated using the sum of squared residuals error a number of other objective functions could be used but the sum of squared residuals was applied as it forms an unbiased estimate of error variance and reflects the overall fit of the model an increase in the sum of squared residuals signaled that a branch of models could be eliminated models were also eliminated based on multicollinearity measured using the condition number belsley et al 2004 a condition number 30 was used to eliminate models dormann et al 2013 candidate models were ranked using the adjusted coefficient of determination adjusted r 2 to compare models with a different number of independent variables other metrics like the akaike information criterion can be used to compare models of different complexity but are not based solely on how well the model fits the calibration data therefore models ranked here based on adjusted r 2 were in order from best to worst fit the five most frequently used independent variables in the top ten regression models were used in the final percentile flow regression model 2 4 2 hydrologic understanding hydrologic understanding of the fdc was used to select a small number of independent variables based on the conceptual model that the fdc can be decomposed into high average and low flows yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the selection process is of course subjective and arguments may be made for different independent variables however the variables chosen here are based on readily accessible data for the contiguous us and a common understanding of the fdc high flows are the product of storms related to total precipitation over the course of a year map storm runoff is moderated by infiltration soil porosity the slope of the basin influences the magnitude and duration of high flows average flows are associated with basin storage conditions influenced by the balance between map and pet and geology bfi low flows in the dry season are generated by baseflow subject to evaporative losses together the conceptual model of different flows was used to select the following independent variables from table 2 map pet slope soil porosity and bfi 2 4 3 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca transforms the independent variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components pcs see kroll and song 2013 for a more in depth explanation of pca each pc explains a percent of the variance in the original data the natural log transformed independent variables produced pcs that explained more variance in the data than pcs based on the non transformed variables the first five pcs based on the log transformed variables explained 76 of the variance in the data and were used for the percentile flow regression models 2 4 4 correlation analysis a correlation analysis was performed to screen cross correlated variables cross correlation was assessed using pearson s and spearman s coefficients a coefficient 0 7 was used to identify cross correlated groups of variables dormann et al 2013 a univariate regression with each percentile flow was conducted to rank both the non transformed and natural log transformed independent variables the variable with the largest r 2 in a cross correlated group was ranked alongside the uncorrelated variables the top five variables were then used for the percentile flow regression models 2 4 5 random forests random forests are regression trees which apply rules e g map 1000 mm to split the data samples basins into progressively smaller groups the smallest groups terminal nodes are averaged to generate predictions see breiman 2001 for a more in depth review the regression trees were developed using random subsets of the basins and evaluated for predictive performance using the out of bag samples not used to develop the regression trees the out of bag error decreased until about 100 regression trees which was the number of trees used in the analysis terminal nodes of the regression trees included five basins or less than 1 of the basins because the size of the terminal nodes has little effect on predictions if a small percentage of the data is used svetnik et al 2003 the number of independent variables evaluated at each split in the regression tree was determined based on an analysis of all values i e 1 22 on all percentile flows i e q 1 q 99 the analysis revealed little difference between the values and a commonly used rule of thumb i e one third of the total number of independent variables rounded down to the nearest whole number the number of variables evaluated at each split was seven independent variables were ranked according to the out of bag error each variable was randomly permuted effectively removing that variable from the predictions a larger increase in the out of bag error quantified as mean squared error indicated a more important variable which received a higher ranking the top five independent variables were based on average rankings from 1000 random forests because rankings can change from one random forest run to the next and an ensemble approach like this is advised saeys et al 2008 natural log transformed independent variables were evaluated for the top five variables the form of the variable that generated a larger r 2 was used in the final percentile flow regression model 2 4 6 symbolic regression symbolic regression evaluates regression models based on a genetic program which simulates the evolution of a population see koza 1994 for a review of the genetic programming process an initial set of independent variables and mathematical operators were presented to the program the operators were limited to addition subtraction and natural log for consistency with the other variable selection methods the variables and operators were combined to generate an initial population of regression models the root mean squared error was used to evaluate the models a model with less error was more likely to pass on attributes to the next generation of models the evolution of the models was influenced by four parameters 1 the number of models in the first generation 2 the number of models in each subsequent generation 3 the number of completely new models generated for each generation and 4 the probability that models with less error were combined to form new models the parameters were set using a sequential parameter optimization procedure defined in bartz beielstein and zaefferer 2012 the final generation of models was ranked according to adjusted r 2 the top ten models were used as in the automated regression procedure to identify the five most frequently used independent variables which were then used in the final percentile flow regression model 2 4 7 bayesian networks bayesian networks assess probabilistic relations to the dependent variable to do so a markov blanket is computed to identify the independent variables that make the dependent variable statistically independent of other variables see aliferis et al 2010 for an explanation of this process a subset of variables explained the probability of observing a particular flow and other variables that had no effect on the flow s probability were eliminated variables can be eliminated either by developing part of the bayesian network around the dependent variable or directly evaluating the conditional probability of the dependent variable the latter approach was applied using hiton markov blanket aliferis et al 2003 but ultimately discarded because it eliminated few independent variables the bayesian network was developed around the dependent variable using a local causal discovery algorithm described in mani and cooper 1999 because the approach selected more than five independent variables the bayesian network was developed five times excluding 20 of the basins each time as in a k fold cross validation the independent variables were ranked based on the number of times that they were selected by the bayesian networks the form of the top five variables i e non transformed or natural log transformed that generated a larger r 2 was used in the final percentile flow regression model 2 5 regression model evaluation regression models used the top five independent variables as follows 2 l n q i 1 β 0 β 1 x 1 β 5 x 5 where the natural log transformation was used to model skewed percentile flows q i a constant of one was added to the percentile flows to calculate the natural log of zero flows β 0 β 1 β 5 are the model coefficients and x 1 x 2 x 5 are the non transformed or natural log transformed independent variables the regression models were assessed for multicollinearity and predictive performance multicollinearity was assessed using the condition number belsley et al 2004 to evaluate the redundancy of independent variables selected by the different variable selection methods predictive performance was assessed using the 184 validation basins withheld from regression model development the difference between observed and predicted percentile flows was evaluated using r 2 nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency and relative error calculated as the absolute difference between observed and predicted values divided by the observed value plus one to accommodate zero flows 3 results the results compare the following variable selection methods abbreviations in parentheses automated regression procedure baseline knowledge based variable selection expert principal component analysis pca correlation analysis corr random forests rf symbolic regression sr and bayesian networks bn 3 1 multicollinearity multicollinearity was not assessed to screen the final percentile flow regression models because it is generally not a concern given large representative samples harrell 2001 and did not impair predictive performance as shown in the next section instead multicollinearity is evaluated here to assess the variable selection method s ability to select non redundant independent variables a larger condition number indicates that the variable selection method chose more redundant variables table 3 the three methods that controlled for multicollinearity baseline pca and corr had the smallest condition numbers pca effectively eliminated multicollinearity by using uncorrelated pcs derived from the independent variables the baseline regression procedure had the second least multicollinearity because it rejected models with a condition number 30 this did however result in few models 18 having multiple independent variables and only three independent variables were used in the largest models accounting for less than 1 of the models the final percentile flow regression models could have a condition number 30 because rather than use fewer variables than other variable selection methods the baseline regression procedure selected the five most frequently used independent variables in high performing models the correlation analysis corr was the least effective of methods that treated multicollinearity because pairwise correlation values failed to account for multicollinearity in the regression models the methods that did not control for multicollinearity expert rf sr and bn had the largest condition numbers table 3 symbolic regression sr and bayesian networks bn had similar levels of multicollinearity although bayesian networks can exclude variables with similar information aliferis et al 2010 variables selected based on hydrologic understanding of the fdc expert experienced multicollinearity due to correlation between pet and bfi pearson correlation coefficient 0 58 and spearman correlation coefficient 0 63 but neither variable was screened to evaluate a purely knowledge based variable selection method random forests had the greatest multicollinearity possibly because the process of evaluating one variable at a time can assign similar rankings to cross correlated variables breiman 2001 and highly ranked variables with the greatest predictive power were cross correlated 3 2 predictive performance predictive performance was quantified using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for each percentile flow fig 2 similar patterns in performance were observed for r 2 and relative error values and are not shown here performance i e nse peaked at the flow equaled or exceeded 20 of the time q 20 and steadily declined for lower flows from q 30 q 99 extreme high flows q 01 and q 05 had the lowest performance the variable selection methods had different levels of predictive performance fig 2 the baseline regression procedure consistently had the second worst performance see flows from q 20 q 99 pca had the worst performance except for q 01 likely because it was the only method that did not use information from the dependent variables the baseline regression procedure and pca performed the worst despite controlling for multicollinearity this indicates the calibration basins were representative of the validation basins and multicollinearity did not impair predictions as in a proxy basin test klemeš 1986 the best performance was achieved mostly by methods other than the baseline regression procedure fig 2 random forests rf symbolic regression sr and bayesian networks bn each had the best performance on three different percentile flows random forests performed best where performance peaked at q 20 and q 30 indicating it was most effective at distinguishing between more influential independent variables average flows from q 40 q 60 were predicted best by symbolic regression which notably used fewer than five variables to predict q 50 and q 60 showing that many of the independent variables were redundant or did not have useful information the same can be said for lower flows from q 70 q 99 for which symbolic regression used only two independent variables but had only slightly lower performance than the best methods i e less than 16 difference from the maximum nse values the lowest flows from q 90 q 99 had a large fraction of zero flows 14 bayesian networks predicted these flows best perhaps because it was most effective at predicting zero flows and able to identify a certain set of conditions e g low baseflow and high evapotranspiration associated with the probability of observing a zero flow finally variables selected based on hydrologic understanding of the fdc expert performed best for q 01 and had nse values within 12 of the best methods on average therefore five carefully selected independent variables were almost as effective as more complex data based methods that had access to 22 independent variables the overall performance of the different variable selection methods is summarized as the sum of relative error in table 4 and largely confirms prior results the worst performance i e largest relative error belonged to pca other than pca the baseline regression procedure did not perform better than any other method the simple approach of selecting variables based on hydrologic understanding expert performed similar to three other data based methods corr sr and bn and had 8 more relative error than random forests rf which minimized relative error the most these results indicate hydrologic understanding is a critical step in predicting the fdc as suggested in castellarin et al 2013 3 3 selected independent variables independent variables selected for a sample of high q 10 average q 50 and low q 90 percentile flow regression models are shown in table 5 similar variables were chosen for other high average and low flows not shown some variables were chosen frequently regardless of flow see aridity bfi and forest these variables were related to the overall shape of the fdc whereas other variables were only related to certain flows see map percent snow and poorly drained mean annual precipitation map was frequently used for high and average percentile flow regression models as these flows are fed by rainfall events and accumulated precipitation over the course of a year yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the percent of precipitation delivered as snow percent snow was often used for high percentile flow regression models possibly due to the contribution of spring snowmelt to high flows in alpine rivers ye et al 2012 the percent of a basin covered in poorly drained soils poorly drained was a common independent variable in low percentile flow regression models poorly drained soils may reduce groundwater supplies for low flows in the dry season cheng et al 2012 the repeated use of independent variables both for different flows and across different variable selection methods indicates once again that many independent variables were either redundant or not useful topographic variables like mean slope were absent from many regression models and not generally useful for predicting percentile flows the variable selection methods had some notable differences in the variables that they chose for the percentile flow regression models table 5 most notably bfi was not used in the baseline regression models but was used in at least 12 of 13 percentile flow regression models formulated by the other variable selection methods this helps explain the poor performance of the baseline regression procedure for many of the percentile flows see fig 2 the baseline regression procedure rejected models that used bfi due to multicollinearity whereas other variable selection methods did not screen for multicollinearity bfi elevated multicollinearity because it is related to other climatic topographic land cover and soil variables price 2011 despite this bfi was a critical variable for raising predictive performance in validation although topographic variables were not generally useful for predicting percentile flows they were useful in specific instances symbolic regression sr was the only method that used mean aspect aspect and mean elevation elev to predict q 50 and q 60 and performed the best on these percentile flows see fig 2 both of these variables aspect and elev are likely related to other long term water balance and climatic conditions associated with average flows ye et al 2012 bayesian networks bn performed best on low flows from q 90 q 99 see fig 2 and unlike other methods used mean daily temperature mean temp and mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet both of which have been tied to low flows in previous work see kroll et al 2004 pumo et al 2013 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 4 discussion multicollinearity was prominent among independent variables see table 3 this is a well documented problem in studies that use a variety of climatic and physical basin characteristics to predict flows see eash and barnes 2017 kroll et al 2004 kroll and song 2013 the problem occurs because climatic and physical characteristics co evolve over time e g poorly developed soils in arid basins and are therefore interdependent hrachowitz et al 2013 multicollinearity is less of a problem for model predictions given a large diverse sample kroll and song 2013 as in this study however if interpreting model coefficients is a priority then an alternative form of regression like partial least squares may be preferred regression procedures screen models for multicollinearity using arbitrary thresholds like a condition number 30 dormann et al 2013 this is an uncertain process since different statistics like the determinant of the correlation matrix or variance inflation factor can be used to screen models and these statistics may be sensitive to the dataset snee and marquardt 1984 in this case the condition number was relaxed to 40 to illustrate the uncertainty in setting the multicollinearity threshold after relaxing the threshold baseline regression models began to use the critical variable of bfi and model performance improved the question of how to treat multicollinearity in regression models for predicting flow is an active area of research kroll and song 2013 and should be investigated for percentile flows using a wide variety of models and multicollinearity statistics as in dormann et al 2013 predictive performance for the different percentile flows see fig 2 followed patterns from previous studies except for the decline in performance for high flows see hashmi and shamseldin 2014 hope and bart 2012 hsu and huang 2017 like these studies predictive performance decreased for lower percentile flows this is common due to the complex non linear processes that govern low flows hope and bart 2011 furthermore independent variables may not adequately represent subsurface properties that influence low flows kroll et al 2004 this study used bfi and several soil variables to represent subsurface properties both bfi and poorly drained soils poorly drained were important variables for predicting low flows see table 5 similar variables related to the storage of a basin should be emphasized in future low flow studies the low flows in this study had zero flows which may require specialized modeling approaches as in hope and bart 2011 the decline in performance for high flows q 01 and q 05 was uncharacteristic of previous studies and may be due to the large variance in floods across the contiguous us prior studies like ssegane et al 2012 have had more success in predicting high flows at a regional scale dividing the contiguous us into flood regions as in regional flood frequency analysis burn 1990 may improve the prediction of high flows identifying homogenous regions i e similar basins reduces the variability of high flows and generally improves the accuracy of predictions burn 1990 however this approach was not applied here because the focus of the study was on comparing variable selection methods and not on grouping basins for regional predictions overall the regression models in this study explained about half of the variance in percentile flows whereas prior studies have explained about three quarters of the variance see hope and bart 2012 hsu and huang 2017 ssegane et al 2012 again the difference may be due to the scale of this study variable selection method comparisons revealed that conventional approaches like a baseline regression procedure and pca did not perform as well as alternative methods see table 4 pca has not improved predictions in previous studies see kroll and song 2013 ssegane et al 2012 and should only be used if controlling for multicollinearity is a priority a baseline regression procedure has performed similarly to bayesian networks in a previous study ssegane et al 2012 but the same study found that bayesian networks more consistently chose the correct independent variables of a known model and therefore more accurately represent a system this can lead to improved percentile flow predictions which was the case when comparing bayesian networks to the baseline regression procedure in this study the best method varied from percentile flow to percentile flow see fig 2 a result that substantiates the recommendation to use a combination of variable selection methods ssegane et al 2012 percentile flow predictions may also be improved through the use of an ensemble e g model averaging approach waseem et al 2015 a small number of independent variables were repeatedly selected for percentile flow regression models see aridity bfi and forest in table 5 aridity i e the ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration to mean annual precipitation is a measure of the long term water balance generally related to storm runoff i e high percentile flows rossi et al 2016 and groundwater storage conditions istanbulluoglu et al 2012 that influence average and low percentile flows yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the percent of streamflow from groundwater bfi is indirectly related to high percentile flows as an indicator of infiltration i e a loss factor for storm runoff yokoo and sivapalan 2011 and directly affects average and low percentile flows cheng et al 2012 bfi describes subsurface drainage and other variables that describe groundwater storage e g aquifer thickness and groundwater discharge e g a baseflow recession constant available as interpolated grids like bfi may help predict percentile flows forest coverage forest moderates high to low percentile flows via interception and evapotranspiration pumo et al 2013 yaeger et al 2012 vegetation indices that convey similar information like leaf area index may improve percentile flow predictions in future studies independent variables selected based on hydrologic understanding of the fdc could be improved based on independent variables frequently used in percentile flow regression models see previous paragraph and predictive performance across the percentile flows see fig 2 frequently used variables i e aridity bfi and forest could be used to replace map and pet combined in aridity and slope not a frequently used variable the other two variables could target high and low percentile flows that had lower predictive performance variables for low percentile flows like poorly drained soils aquifer thickness and a baseflow recession constant have been previously discussed high percentile flows correlate strongly to variables that describe maximum precipitation such as maximum daily precipitation times the fraction of days without precipitation cheng et al 2012 a revised set of independent variables based on hydrologic understanding of the fdc is aridity bfi forest a variable that describes subsurface drainage e g poorly drained soils and a variable that describes maximum precipitation e g maximum daily precipitation times the fraction of days without precipitation 5 conclusions variable selection methods to develop percentile flow regression models were compared for a large sample of 918 basins in the united states because of the large sample multicollinearity i e cross correlation between independent variables was not a problem for predictive performance on the 184 validation basins withheld from model development instead high levels of multicollinearity indicate that many commonly used independent variables such as an array of different climatic variables are redundant treating multicollinearity using a regression diagnostic i e the condition number and principal components was problematic for an automated regression procedure and pca both of which had the worst overall performance of variable selection methods other variable selection methods performed better because they used bfi a highly important albeit cross correlated independent variable the best overall method i e random forests only performed marginally better than variables selected based on hydrologic understanding of the fdc which indicates at the very least the initial set of independent variables should be explicitly linked to hydrologic processes that influence the fdc the best predictive performance did not belong to any one method for the various percentile flows suggesting that using a combination of variable selection methods either to rank variables or develop ensemble models could enhance percentile flow regression models predictive performance declined for high and low percentile flows independent variables specifically targeting these flows such as variables that characterize storm runoff and basin storage should be developed in future work homogenous regions that reduce the variance in percentile flows should also be developed to further advance percentile flow regression models for the contiguous us the study was limited to the context of developing regression models however future work may leverage large datasets such as in this study to use more adaptable model forms from the field of soft computing emphasis of this research thus far has been on streamflow forecasting see yaseen et al 2019 for example but now with access to large basin databases machine learning models

5416,the flow duration curve fdc is widely used for river management operations such as hydropower percentile flows of the fdc express the percent of time a flow is equaled or exceeded and often need to be predicted for ungauged basins regression models are commonly used to predict percentile flows however a major challenge of this approach is selecting basin characteristics to serve as independent variables the number of basin characteristics precludes an analysis of all possible models thus a subset of models are typically evaluated using an automated regression procedure like stepwise regression or the more exhaustive branch and bound approach the latter was used as a baseline approach in this study and was compared to six other less commonly used methods from the field of variable feature selection the performance of all seven approaches was evaluated based on percentile flow regression models developed for a large sample of 918 basins in the united states the baseline regression procedure only outperformed principal component analysis the only method that did not use the percentile flows to select variables of the variable selection methods that used the percentile flows the regression procedure performed the worst this suggests that regression procedures should not be the first choice among variable selection methods for developing percentile flow regression models variables selected based on knowledge of the fdc performed nearly as well as the best overall data based method i e random forests random forests and other methods that performed well emphasized the influence of geology on percentile flows a geologic variable i e baseflow index had the largest effect on predictive performance all of the models suffered from large predictive error and future work should apply a regional approach that groups similar basins to predict percentile flows keywords flow duration curve ungauged basin regression variable selection united states 1 introduction the flow duration curve fdc is a widely used tool for managing rivers the percent of time a flow is equaled or exceeded i e percentile flow is a component of the fdc that supplies essential information for river applications such as hydropower wastewater treatment and water abstractions vogel and fennessey 1995 however gauged flow data is normally not available to calculate percentile flows in this case methods are used to transfer percentile flows from gauged basins to ungauged basins regression models are a simple and common method to predict percentile flows see the united states us geological survey streamstats application summarized in ries et al 2017 the method is founded on the idea that climatic and physical basin characteristics influence the fdc and therefore can be used as independent variables in percentile flow regression models a major challenge of this method is selecting independent variables among many possible basin characteristics the number of basin characteristics has grown due to advances in geographic information systems and remote sensing a database in the us called geospatial attributes of gages for evaluating streamflow version ii gages ii has over 300 basin characteristics falcone 2011 studies to predict percentile flows and other streamflow statistics have used 251 different basin characteristics as independent variables ssegane et al 2012 given the number of independent variables it is not possible to evaluate all models formed from every combination of variables a study using only 40 independent variables surpasses a trillion possible models i e 240 1 for this reason many studies evaluate a subset of models using automated regression procedures e g eash and barnes 2017 hsu and huang 2017 painter et al 2017 despite their frequent use automated regression procedures are widely criticized in the field of statistics see copas 1983 flom and cassell 2007 harrell 2001 for criticisms automated regression procedures are known to produce biased model parameters and as a result often underperform on new data in model validation alternative approaches do not use regression and select variables according to 1 knowledge of the dependent variable or 2 data based methods from the field of feature selection 1 1 knowledge based variable selection knowledge based variable selection uses a conceptual understanding of the dependent variable to select independent variables a conceptual understanding can be developed based on the literature although this can be subjective a small number of carefully selected independent variables is recommended for regression modeling see harrell 2001 among others a similar recommendation for ungauged basin model development suggests that independent variables should be carefully selected to reflect the processes that influence streamflow castellarin et al 2013 in doing so models may be less specific to a particular dataset and more transferable to ungauged basins the fdc has a strong physical underpinning vogel and fennessey 1995 geographic variation of the fdc is tied to the water balance yaeger et al 2012 topographic setting ye et al 2012 and geology cheng et al 2012 of a region a modeling study yokoo and sivapalan 2011 decomposed the fdc into 1 high flows contributed by surface runoff during storm events with a loss factor for infiltration 2 average flows reflecting long term storage conditions influenced by climate and geology and 3 low flows supplied by groundwater in the dry season subject to evapotranspiration losses this information can be used to select independent variables associated with the fdc 1 2 data based variable selection data based variable selection methods are developed in the field of feature selection to reduce large datasets for modeling purposes feature selection can be broadly categorized into methods that 1 control for redundant cross correlated independent variables and 2 select a subset of variables based on a specified relation to the dependent variable the former treats cross correlated independent variables multicollinearity to address possible model instability on new data dormann et al 2013 treating multicollinearity can involve deriving new latent variables that reduce cross correlation or screening variables based on cross correlation a disadvantage of these methods is that they do not use information from the dependent variable in addition multicollinearity may not be a concern for predictions harrell 2001 if the model data represents systematic relations between variables that also occur in new data e g snowfall varies with elevation a subset of independent variables can be selected based on a mathematical relation to the dependent variable the mathematical relation may express the independent variable s explanatory power or probabilistic association with the dependent variable a variable s explanatory power is evaluated according to its effect on model performance models are evaluated by excluding one variable at a time breiman 2001 or a training algorithm can be used to screen variables that do not contribute to model performance koza 1994 these methods are however prone to including irrelevant variables due to simpson s 1951 paradox a condition in which a relevant variable becomes irrelevant in the presence of another variable methods that evaluate probabilistic relations to the dependent variable are effective at filtering irrelevant independent variables pearl 2014 probabilistic relations are evaluated based on the conditional probability that an observed outcome flow changes in the presence of another set of variables e g the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration changes the probability of observing a particular flow the present study compares a typical automated regression procedure to six other less widely used variable selection methods on a large sample of 918 basins for more generalizable results the objectives of this study were to 1 develop regression models to predict percentile flows for ungauged basins in the us and 2 evaluate the performance of different variable selection methods for developing the regression models other modeling approaches such as artificial neural networks may be applied to predict percentile flows however these approaches also require variable selection the choice of a modeling approach is unlikely to change the relative performance of different variable selection methods therefore regression models were applied here as a simple and widely used approach the study addresses the following research question how should independent variables be selected for the regression modeling of fdc percentile flows a hypothesis is that a small number of carefully selected independent variables may perform similar to evaluating many independent variables in a data based approach because multicollinearity is common among independent variables kroll and song 2013 and the fdc can be decomposed into only three distinct physical components yokoo and sivapalan 2011 2 methods 2 1 basins the study used 918 basins in the gages ii database falcone 2011 classified as near natural with little development each basin had to have 30 years of continuous daily streamflow record to calculate percentile flows see the next section the basins were split into 734 calibration basins and 184 validation basins fig 1 meeting a recommendation that model validation should be conducted with at least 100 samples harrell 2001 validation basins were selected at random within groups based on köppen climate classes peel et al 2007 three major rock types reed and bush 2005 and drainage area the result facilitated a proxy basin test klemeš 1986 in which the calibration and validation basins had similar physiographic conditions table 1 a cross validation approach in which small samples of the data are iteratively excluded from model development could have been applied but was not required given the large calibration and validation sample sizes which generally produce stable results harrell 2001 the calibration and validation samples share similar statistical distributions which should suppress the effect of multicollinearity on predictions harrell 2001 2 2 percentile flows percentile flows were calculated using 30 years of daily streamflow data to generate stable streamflow statistics for different time periods kennard et al 2010 the weibull plotting position was used to calculate the probability of a flow being equaled or exceeded as follows 1 p r n 1 100 where p is the exceedance probability of a flow with rank r in decreasing order among n flow observations other equations may be used to calculate the exceedance probability but are known to generate similar results for large records of n 100 sadegh et al 2016 a total of 13 percentile flows were calculated at intervals of ten percent from q 10 q 90 extreme high flows q 1 and q 5 and extreme low flows q 95 and q 99 each percentile flow was normalized divided by the mean of nonzero flows to compare basins with different flow magnitudes hope and bart 2011 2 3 independent variables the independent variables are described in table 2 a review of the literature on fdc prediction and data covering the contiguous us was conducted to select a representative array of independent variables including climatic topographic land cover soil and geologic basin characteristics climatic characteristics were derived from monthly data during the same time periods as the streamflow data except for daily precipitation variables which used a 30 year time period from 1981 to 2010 because daily data was not available for all streamflow time periods the time period of 1981 2010 was used because it overlapped with streamflow data from the most basins the percent of precipitation delivered as snow is a gages ii variable calculated using long term data from 1901 to 2000 forest cover was used to summarize land cover due to cross correlation among land cover classes and the noted effect of forest cover on the fdc brown et al 2013 geology was represented using the baseflow index i e the percent of streamflow from groundwater a strong indicator of basin geology price 2011 useful for predicting the fdc in prior studies see castellarin et al 2013 eash and barnes 2017 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the baseflow index was calculated using streamflow data at gauged locations and interpolated into a grid for ungauged streamflow predictions wolock 2003 both non transformed and natural log transformed independent variables were used in variable selection methods independent variables were converted to z scores i e number of standard deviations from the mean for variable selection methods sensitive to variables on different scales i e principal component analysis symbolic regression and bayesian networks 2 4 variable selection methods the independent variables were selected for percentile flow regression models using a number of methods a summary of each method follows with references that cover the method in more depth because methods may select a different number of variables each method was applied in a way that supplied the top five variables the different methods could then be compared for constructing percentile flow regression models again in the interest of comparing variable selection methods regression models were not developed for sub regions as in some other studies see tsakiris et al 2011 for example 2 4 1 automated regression procedure an automated regression procedure served as the baseline approach commonly used in percentile flow regression modeling studies a branch and bound procedure was used in lieu of stepwise regression because it conducts a more exhaustive search of all possible models to do so the branch and bound procedure applies the logic that adding an independent variable should improve the fit of the model if a variable is added and model fit is not improved then the branch of models including that variable is eliminated see miller 2002 for a more in depth review model fit was evaluated using the sum of squared residuals error a number of other objective functions could be used but the sum of squared residuals was applied as it forms an unbiased estimate of error variance and reflects the overall fit of the model an increase in the sum of squared residuals signaled that a branch of models could be eliminated models were also eliminated based on multicollinearity measured using the condition number belsley et al 2004 a condition number 30 was used to eliminate models dormann et al 2013 candidate models were ranked using the adjusted coefficient of determination adjusted r 2 to compare models with a different number of independent variables other metrics like the akaike information criterion can be used to compare models of different complexity but are not based solely on how well the model fits the calibration data therefore models ranked here based on adjusted r 2 were in order from best to worst fit the five most frequently used independent variables in the top ten regression models were used in the final percentile flow regression model 2 4 2 hydrologic understanding hydrologic understanding of the fdc was used to select a small number of independent variables based on the conceptual model that the fdc can be decomposed into high average and low flows yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the selection process is of course subjective and arguments may be made for different independent variables however the variables chosen here are based on readily accessible data for the contiguous us and a common understanding of the fdc high flows are the product of storms related to total precipitation over the course of a year map storm runoff is moderated by infiltration soil porosity the slope of the basin influences the magnitude and duration of high flows average flows are associated with basin storage conditions influenced by the balance between map and pet and geology bfi low flows in the dry season are generated by baseflow subject to evaporative losses together the conceptual model of different flows was used to select the following independent variables from table 2 map pet slope soil porosity and bfi 2 4 3 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca transforms the independent variables into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components pcs see kroll and song 2013 for a more in depth explanation of pca each pc explains a percent of the variance in the original data the natural log transformed independent variables produced pcs that explained more variance in the data than pcs based on the non transformed variables the first five pcs based on the log transformed variables explained 76 of the variance in the data and were used for the percentile flow regression models 2 4 4 correlation analysis a correlation analysis was performed to screen cross correlated variables cross correlation was assessed using pearson s and spearman s coefficients a coefficient 0 7 was used to identify cross correlated groups of variables dormann et al 2013 a univariate regression with each percentile flow was conducted to rank both the non transformed and natural log transformed independent variables the variable with the largest r 2 in a cross correlated group was ranked alongside the uncorrelated variables the top five variables were then used for the percentile flow regression models 2 4 5 random forests random forests are regression trees which apply rules e g map 1000 mm to split the data samples basins into progressively smaller groups the smallest groups terminal nodes are averaged to generate predictions see breiman 2001 for a more in depth review the regression trees were developed using random subsets of the basins and evaluated for predictive performance using the out of bag samples not used to develop the regression trees the out of bag error decreased until about 100 regression trees which was the number of trees used in the analysis terminal nodes of the regression trees included five basins or less than 1 of the basins because the size of the terminal nodes has little effect on predictions if a small percentage of the data is used svetnik et al 2003 the number of independent variables evaluated at each split in the regression tree was determined based on an analysis of all values i e 1 22 on all percentile flows i e q 1 q 99 the analysis revealed little difference between the values and a commonly used rule of thumb i e one third of the total number of independent variables rounded down to the nearest whole number the number of variables evaluated at each split was seven independent variables were ranked according to the out of bag error each variable was randomly permuted effectively removing that variable from the predictions a larger increase in the out of bag error quantified as mean squared error indicated a more important variable which received a higher ranking the top five independent variables were based on average rankings from 1000 random forests because rankings can change from one random forest run to the next and an ensemble approach like this is advised saeys et al 2008 natural log transformed independent variables were evaluated for the top five variables the form of the variable that generated a larger r 2 was used in the final percentile flow regression model 2 4 6 symbolic regression symbolic regression evaluates regression models based on a genetic program which simulates the evolution of a population see koza 1994 for a review of the genetic programming process an initial set of independent variables and mathematical operators were presented to the program the operators were limited to addition subtraction and natural log for consistency with the other variable selection methods the variables and operators were combined to generate an initial population of regression models the root mean squared error was used to evaluate the models a model with less error was more likely to pass on attributes to the next generation of models the evolution of the models was influenced by four parameters 1 the number of models in the first generation 2 the number of models in each subsequent generation 3 the number of completely new models generated for each generation and 4 the probability that models with less error were combined to form new models the parameters were set using a sequential parameter optimization procedure defined in bartz beielstein and zaefferer 2012 the final generation of models was ranked according to adjusted r 2 the top ten models were used as in the automated regression procedure to identify the five most frequently used independent variables which were then used in the final percentile flow regression model 2 4 7 bayesian networks bayesian networks assess probabilistic relations to the dependent variable to do so a markov blanket is computed to identify the independent variables that make the dependent variable statistically independent of other variables see aliferis et al 2010 for an explanation of this process a subset of variables explained the probability of observing a particular flow and other variables that had no effect on the flow s probability were eliminated variables can be eliminated either by developing part of the bayesian network around the dependent variable or directly evaluating the conditional probability of the dependent variable the latter approach was applied using hiton markov blanket aliferis et al 2003 but ultimately discarded because it eliminated few independent variables the bayesian network was developed around the dependent variable using a local causal discovery algorithm described in mani and cooper 1999 because the approach selected more than five independent variables the bayesian network was developed five times excluding 20 of the basins each time as in a k fold cross validation the independent variables were ranked based on the number of times that they were selected by the bayesian networks the form of the top five variables i e non transformed or natural log transformed that generated a larger r 2 was used in the final percentile flow regression model 2 5 regression model evaluation regression models used the top five independent variables as follows 2 l n q i 1 β 0 β 1 x 1 β 5 x 5 where the natural log transformation was used to model skewed percentile flows q i a constant of one was added to the percentile flows to calculate the natural log of zero flows β 0 β 1 β 5 are the model coefficients and x 1 x 2 x 5 are the non transformed or natural log transformed independent variables the regression models were assessed for multicollinearity and predictive performance multicollinearity was assessed using the condition number belsley et al 2004 to evaluate the redundancy of independent variables selected by the different variable selection methods predictive performance was assessed using the 184 validation basins withheld from regression model development the difference between observed and predicted percentile flows was evaluated using r 2 nash and sutcliffe 1970 efficiency and relative error calculated as the absolute difference between observed and predicted values divided by the observed value plus one to accommodate zero flows 3 results the results compare the following variable selection methods abbreviations in parentheses automated regression procedure baseline knowledge based variable selection expert principal component analysis pca correlation analysis corr random forests rf symbolic regression sr and bayesian networks bn 3 1 multicollinearity multicollinearity was not assessed to screen the final percentile flow regression models because it is generally not a concern given large representative samples harrell 2001 and did not impair predictive performance as shown in the next section instead multicollinearity is evaluated here to assess the variable selection method s ability to select non redundant independent variables a larger condition number indicates that the variable selection method chose more redundant variables table 3 the three methods that controlled for multicollinearity baseline pca and corr had the smallest condition numbers pca effectively eliminated multicollinearity by using uncorrelated pcs derived from the independent variables the baseline regression procedure had the second least multicollinearity because it rejected models with a condition number 30 this did however result in few models 18 having multiple independent variables and only three independent variables were used in the largest models accounting for less than 1 of the models the final percentile flow regression models could have a condition number 30 because rather than use fewer variables than other variable selection methods the baseline regression procedure selected the five most frequently used independent variables in high performing models the correlation analysis corr was the least effective of methods that treated multicollinearity because pairwise correlation values failed to account for multicollinearity in the regression models the methods that did not control for multicollinearity expert rf sr and bn had the largest condition numbers table 3 symbolic regression sr and bayesian networks bn had similar levels of multicollinearity although bayesian networks can exclude variables with similar information aliferis et al 2010 variables selected based on hydrologic understanding of the fdc expert experienced multicollinearity due to correlation between pet and bfi pearson correlation coefficient 0 58 and spearman correlation coefficient 0 63 but neither variable was screened to evaluate a purely knowledge based variable selection method random forests had the greatest multicollinearity possibly because the process of evaluating one variable at a time can assign similar rankings to cross correlated variables breiman 2001 and highly ranked variables with the greatest predictive power were cross correlated 3 2 predictive performance predictive performance was quantified using the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for each percentile flow fig 2 similar patterns in performance were observed for r 2 and relative error values and are not shown here performance i e nse peaked at the flow equaled or exceeded 20 of the time q 20 and steadily declined for lower flows from q 30 q 99 extreme high flows q 01 and q 05 had the lowest performance the variable selection methods had different levels of predictive performance fig 2 the baseline regression procedure consistently had the second worst performance see flows from q 20 q 99 pca had the worst performance except for q 01 likely because it was the only method that did not use information from the dependent variables the baseline regression procedure and pca performed the worst despite controlling for multicollinearity this indicates the calibration basins were representative of the validation basins and multicollinearity did not impair predictions as in a proxy basin test klemeš 1986 the best performance was achieved mostly by methods other than the baseline regression procedure fig 2 random forests rf symbolic regression sr and bayesian networks bn each had the best performance on three different percentile flows random forests performed best where performance peaked at q 20 and q 30 indicating it was most effective at distinguishing between more influential independent variables average flows from q 40 q 60 were predicted best by symbolic regression which notably used fewer than five variables to predict q 50 and q 60 showing that many of the independent variables were redundant or did not have useful information the same can be said for lower flows from q 70 q 99 for which symbolic regression used only two independent variables but had only slightly lower performance than the best methods i e less than 16 difference from the maximum nse values the lowest flows from q 90 q 99 had a large fraction of zero flows 14 bayesian networks predicted these flows best perhaps because it was most effective at predicting zero flows and able to identify a certain set of conditions e g low baseflow and high evapotranspiration associated with the probability of observing a zero flow finally variables selected based on hydrologic understanding of the fdc expert performed best for q 01 and had nse values within 12 of the best methods on average therefore five carefully selected independent variables were almost as effective as more complex data based methods that had access to 22 independent variables the overall performance of the different variable selection methods is summarized as the sum of relative error in table 4 and largely confirms prior results the worst performance i e largest relative error belonged to pca other than pca the baseline regression procedure did not perform better than any other method the simple approach of selecting variables based on hydrologic understanding expert performed similar to three other data based methods corr sr and bn and had 8 more relative error than random forests rf which minimized relative error the most these results indicate hydrologic understanding is a critical step in predicting the fdc as suggested in castellarin et al 2013 3 3 selected independent variables independent variables selected for a sample of high q 10 average q 50 and low q 90 percentile flow regression models are shown in table 5 similar variables were chosen for other high average and low flows not shown some variables were chosen frequently regardless of flow see aridity bfi and forest these variables were related to the overall shape of the fdc whereas other variables were only related to certain flows see map percent snow and poorly drained mean annual precipitation map was frequently used for high and average percentile flow regression models as these flows are fed by rainfall events and accumulated precipitation over the course of a year yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the percent of precipitation delivered as snow percent snow was often used for high percentile flow regression models possibly due to the contribution of spring snowmelt to high flows in alpine rivers ye et al 2012 the percent of a basin covered in poorly drained soils poorly drained was a common independent variable in low percentile flow regression models poorly drained soils may reduce groundwater supplies for low flows in the dry season cheng et al 2012 the repeated use of independent variables both for different flows and across different variable selection methods indicates once again that many independent variables were either redundant or not useful topographic variables like mean slope were absent from many regression models and not generally useful for predicting percentile flows the variable selection methods had some notable differences in the variables that they chose for the percentile flow regression models table 5 most notably bfi was not used in the baseline regression models but was used in at least 12 of 13 percentile flow regression models formulated by the other variable selection methods this helps explain the poor performance of the baseline regression procedure for many of the percentile flows see fig 2 the baseline regression procedure rejected models that used bfi due to multicollinearity whereas other variable selection methods did not screen for multicollinearity bfi elevated multicollinearity because it is related to other climatic topographic land cover and soil variables price 2011 despite this bfi was a critical variable for raising predictive performance in validation although topographic variables were not generally useful for predicting percentile flows they were useful in specific instances symbolic regression sr was the only method that used mean aspect aspect and mean elevation elev to predict q 50 and q 60 and performed the best on these percentile flows see fig 2 both of these variables aspect and elev are likely related to other long term water balance and climatic conditions associated with average flows ye et al 2012 bayesian networks bn performed best on low flows from q 90 q 99 see fig 2 and unlike other methods used mean daily temperature mean temp and mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet both of which have been tied to low flows in previous work see kroll et al 2004 pumo et al 2013 yokoo and sivapalan 2011 4 discussion multicollinearity was prominent among independent variables see table 3 this is a well documented problem in studies that use a variety of climatic and physical basin characteristics to predict flows see eash and barnes 2017 kroll et al 2004 kroll and song 2013 the problem occurs because climatic and physical characteristics co evolve over time e g poorly developed soils in arid basins and are therefore interdependent hrachowitz et al 2013 multicollinearity is less of a problem for model predictions given a large diverse sample kroll and song 2013 as in this study however if interpreting model coefficients is a priority then an alternative form of regression like partial least squares may be preferred regression procedures screen models for multicollinearity using arbitrary thresholds like a condition number 30 dormann et al 2013 this is an uncertain process since different statistics like the determinant of the correlation matrix or variance inflation factor can be used to screen models and these statistics may be sensitive to the dataset snee and marquardt 1984 in this case the condition number was relaxed to 40 to illustrate the uncertainty in setting the multicollinearity threshold after relaxing the threshold baseline regression models began to use the critical variable of bfi and model performance improved the question of how to treat multicollinearity in regression models for predicting flow is an active area of research kroll and song 2013 and should be investigated for percentile flows using a wide variety of models and multicollinearity statistics as in dormann et al 2013 predictive performance for the different percentile flows see fig 2 followed patterns from previous studies except for the decline in performance for high flows see hashmi and shamseldin 2014 hope and bart 2012 hsu and huang 2017 like these studies predictive performance decreased for lower percentile flows this is common due to the complex non linear processes that govern low flows hope and bart 2011 furthermore independent variables may not adequately represent subsurface properties that influence low flows kroll et al 2004 this study used bfi and several soil variables to represent subsurface properties both bfi and poorly drained soils poorly drained were important variables for predicting low flows see table 5 similar variables related to the storage of a basin should be emphasized in future low flow studies the low flows in this study had zero flows which may require specialized modeling approaches as in hope and bart 2011 the decline in performance for high flows q 01 and q 05 was uncharacteristic of previous studies and may be due to the large variance in floods across the contiguous us prior studies like ssegane et al 2012 have had more success in predicting high flows at a regional scale dividing the contiguous us into flood regions as in regional flood frequency analysis burn 1990 may improve the prediction of high flows identifying homogenous regions i e similar basins reduces the variability of high flows and generally improves the accuracy of predictions burn 1990 however this approach was not applied here because the focus of the study was on comparing variable selection methods and not on grouping basins for regional predictions overall the regression models in this study explained about half of the variance in percentile flows whereas prior studies have explained about three quarters of the variance see hope and bart 2012 hsu and huang 2017 ssegane et al 2012 again the difference may be due to the scale of this study variable selection method comparisons revealed that conventional approaches like a baseline regression procedure and pca did not perform as well as alternative methods see table 4 pca has not improved predictions in previous studies see kroll and song 2013 ssegane et al 2012 and should only be used if controlling for multicollinearity is a priority a baseline regression procedure has performed similarly to bayesian networks in a previous study ssegane et al 2012 but the same study found that bayesian networks more consistently chose the correct independent variables of a known model and therefore more accurately represent a system this can lead to improved percentile flow predictions which was the case when comparing bayesian networks to the baseline regression procedure in this study the best method varied from percentile flow to percentile flow see fig 2 a result that substantiates the recommendation to use a combination of variable selection methods ssegane et al 2012 percentile flow predictions may also be improved through the use of an ensemble e g model averaging approach waseem et al 2015 a small number of independent variables were repeatedly selected for percentile flow regression models see aridity bfi and forest in table 5 aridity i e the ratio of mean annual potential evapotranspiration to mean annual precipitation is a measure of the long term water balance generally related to storm runoff i e high percentile flows rossi et al 2016 and groundwater storage conditions istanbulluoglu et al 2012 that influence average and low percentile flows yokoo and sivapalan 2011 the percent of streamflow from groundwater bfi is indirectly related to high percentile flows as an indicator of infiltration i e a loss factor for storm runoff yokoo and sivapalan 2011 and directly affects average and low percentile flows cheng et al 2012 bfi describes subsurface drainage and other variables that describe groundwater storage e g aquifer thickness and groundwater discharge e g a baseflow recession constant available as interpolated grids like bfi may help predict percentile flows forest coverage forest moderates high to low percentile flows via interception and evapotranspiration pumo et al 2013 yaeger et al 2012 vegetation indices that convey similar information like leaf area index may improve percentile flow predictions in future studies independent variables selected based on hydrologic understanding of the fdc could be improved based on independent variables frequently used in percentile flow regression models see previous paragraph and predictive performance across the percentile flows see fig 2 frequently used variables i e aridity bfi and forest could be used to replace map and pet combined in aridity and slope not a frequently used variable the other two variables could target high and low percentile flows that had lower predictive performance variables for low percentile flows like poorly drained soils aquifer thickness and a baseflow recession constant have been previously discussed high percentile flows correlate strongly to variables that describe maximum precipitation such as maximum daily precipitation times the fraction of days without precipitation cheng et al 2012 a revised set of independent variables based on hydrologic understanding of the fdc is aridity bfi forest a variable that describes subsurface drainage e g poorly drained soils and a variable that describes maximum precipitation e g maximum daily precipitation times the fraction of days without precipitation 5 conclusions variable selection methods to develop percentile flow regression models were compared for a large sample of 918 basins in the united states because of the large sample multicollinearity i e cross correlation between independent variables was not a problem for predictive performance on the 184 validation basins withheld from model development instead high levels of multicollinearity indicate that many commonly used independent variables such as an array of different climatic variables are redundant treating multicollinearity using a regression diagnostic i e the condition number and principal components was problematic for an automated regression procedure and pca both of which had the worst overall performance of variable selection methods other variable selection methods performed better because they used bfi a highly important albeit cross correlated independent variable the best overall method i e random forests only performed marginally better than variables selected based on hydrologic understanding of the fdc which indicates at the very least the initial set of independent variables should be explicitly linked to hydrologic processes that influence the fdc the best predictive performance did not belong to any one method for the various percentile flows suggesting that using a combination of variable selection methods either to rank variables or develop ensemble models could enhance percentile flow regression models predictive performance declined for high and low percentile flows independent variables specifically targeting these flows such as variables that characterize storm runoff and basin storage should be developed in future work homogenous regions that reduce the variance in percentile flows should also be developed to further advance percentile flow regression models for the contiguous us the study was limited to the context of developing regression models however future work may leverage large datasets such as in this study to use more adaptable model forms from the field of soft computing emphasis of this research thus far has been on streamflow forecasting see yaseen et al 2019 for example but now with access to large basin databases machine learning models

5417,in the present study we investigated water use strategies of mature stands of fagus sylvatica european beech with and without co cultivation of abies alba silver fir during a summer drought and subsequent rewetting through simulated heavy precipitation in a temperate forest in south west germany we used a combination of sap flow analysis water stable isotope labeling and a simple linear mixing model with physiological restrictions to determine whether both species were able to switch water uptake depths during drought and reverse this switch after restoration of water supply we showed that both species utilized water from relatively deep soil layers 0 5 m during the drought phase though for beech trees these contributions were not able to support the high transpiration demands in contrast the transpiration of firs remained unaffected by drought probably due to a mixture of its isohydric water use strategy and taproot system the reactions towards high intensity irrigation differed among species but also between beeches of the pure and mixed stands while beech trees in the pure stand once water uptake from the topsoil was re established used 70 of water from more shallow soil depths and were able to restore transpiration beech trees in the mixed stand obtained only 50 and transpiration decreased further firs used around 70 of the water in shallow soil layers and transpiration rates again remained unaffected these differences indicate competition between beech trees and firs in the mixed stand upon drought we conclude that drought is able to disrupt water relations in mixed temperate forested ecosystems in such a way that facilitation can turn into competition for resources like water abbreviations slm simple linear mixed model swc soil water content rwu root water uptake ψm soil matrix potential ψplantmax max measured plant water potential keywords mixed species forest drought heavy precipitation fagus sylvatica abies alba root water uptake 1 introduction mixed species forests are often related to increased productivity pretzsch et al 2013a b 2015 thereby providing higher carbon sinks ruiz benito et al 2014 higher ecological value jactel et al 2017 and reduction of drought sensibility lebourgeois et al 2013 or faster drought recovery schwarz and bauhus 2019 the functional traits enabling mixed species stands to be more resistant towards drought have often been associated with partitioning of resources such as water or nutrients forrester 2014 this niche partitioning might be a key feature when trying to adapt forested ecosystems towards increasing number of extreme events such as heat and drought ipcc 2013 therefore it is not surprising that the future performance of native tree species under a changing climate is frequently discussed and associated with the promotion of mixing tree species bmel 2014 lindner et al 2010 pretzsch et al 2014 the most abundant and dominant deciduous tree species in temperate latitudes is fagus sylvatica l european beech from here on referred to as beech described as drought sensitive fotelli et al 2003 mérian and lebourgeois 2011 particularly due to its relatively shallow rooting system extending vertically to about 1 m with a maximum rooting density between 0 1 and 0 2 m schmid and kazda 2001 therefore there is an ongoing discussion about silvicultural management concepts to stabilize this native tree species and its ecosystems one of the most common concepts is the diversification of forest stands including natural regeneration and facilitation of mixed stands morin et al 2011 pretzsch et al 2013a b toïgo et al 2015 pure and mixed stands can differ significantly in attributes and interactions within the critical zone due to the species specific capability of trees to modify their environment in this regard trees are able to alter soil microclimate aussenac 2000 amount and quality of leaf and root litter augusto et al 2002 rooting depths köstler et al 1968 schmid and kazda 2001 and thus change soil infiltration rates and water storage capacities of soils lange et al 2013 therefore various studies investigated the mixing effect of different tree species on e g soil properties paluch and gruba 2012 tree growth lebourgeois et al 2013 forest productivity pretzsch et al 2013a b and drought tolerance zang et al 2014 the summer heatwaves and droughts of 2003 and 2015 in central europe were demonstrations of the extent that climate change will likely have on forest ecosystems in the near future ciais et al 2005 ionita et al 2017 ipcc 2014 contrarily to beech trees abies alba mill silver fir from here on referred to as fir is described as relative resilient to drought due to its deep taproot system able to reach depths of up to 3 m brosinger et al 2004 köstler et al 1968 an adaption playing a key role for the melioration of drought therefore one aim of this study was to elucidate if this trait would enable firs to switch water uptake from more shallow towards deeper and presumably moister soil layers when exposed to prolonged drought and if this switch in water supply depth was constrained in beech trees without taproot system besides the predicted higher number of drought events an increased frequency of heavy precipitation events especially after prolonged droughts so called drying wetting cycles will have strong impacts on forests of temperate latitudes in the future gessler et al 2006 lindner et al 2010 the question arises how trees cope with these extreme conditions which strategies do they favor and is there evidence for a universal approach of different tree species while reaction and adaption strategies of tree water use to drought are generally well studied e g david et al 2013 brunner et al 2015 brinkmann et al 2016 there are only few field studies on responses of tree water use to drying wetting cycles e g volkmann et al 2016 volkmann et al 2016 investigated the response of juvenile quercus petraea and juvenile fagus sylvatica l to drought with subsequent precipitation using stable isotopes as a tracer in the precipitate they found that the juvenile deciduous trees were able to switch water uptake between soil depths and are able to take up large amounts of event water fast as a second aim of the present study we wanted to elucidate if this ability was still present in mature beech and fir trees and could compensate for the reduced water supply during extended drought to address these aims we comparatively analyzed water relations of mature beech trees in monospecific stands and in stands mixed with fir in the black forest south west germany due to its major importance for forests in this region covering approximately 45 of the forest area kändler and cullman 2016 hereby we compared water uptake and sap flow rates of beech and fir trees under simulated drought conditions experiment 1 and subsequent simulated heavy precipitation experiment 2 within the vegetation period of 2017 drought conditions were simulated by excluding precipitation for three months using rain shelters during the dry down phase we a characterized water uptake by roots and the transpiration fluxes of trees and b determined if both tree species i e beech and fir are able to utilize water from deep soil layers using water stable isotopes to simulate precipitation after drought we irrigated pure and mixed stands of beech with water enriched in deuterium and compared the isotopic composition of xylem sap with soil water as previously described by volkmann et al 2016 furthermore we investigated the effect of fir on beech trees by comparing beech trees in pure and mixed stands regarding the amount of event water uptake response time and soil infiltration patterns in addition to using stable water isotopes as a tracer in soil and xylem we used sap flow as a proxy for transpiration to link isotope data with xylem sap fluxes 2 materials and

two hour interval between 07 00am 09 00 pm n 9 per tree afterwards sampling was conducted twice per week taking only a single measurement per day and tree until the 20th july 2 2 2 irrigation labelling experiment 2 to investigate the response in water uptake patterns upon precipitation after drought we chose a two step irrigation event one of 40 mm with 1600 δd deuterium oxide sigma aldrich chemistry st louis usa on 18th august within 4 h and the other one ten days later as an event of 60 mm without labeling natural abundance signature of δd was 64 within 6 h we chose this approach to retain clearly distinguishable deuterium signatures within the soil to ensure even water distribution over the whole plot area lawn sprinklers were used and periodically changed in position during the first five days after the first irrigation event xylem sap n 3 beeches and firs in the mixed stand respectively and n 5 beeches in the pure beech stand was sampled at two hour intervals between 09 00am 07 00 pm subsequently sampling was conducted once or twice per week taking only a single measurement per tree and day to monitor water movement from the soil surface to deeper soil layers soil n 3 per soil depth and suction cups n 7 per soil depth were sampled daily until august 23rd and afterwards on a four day basis see section 2 2 3 2 2 3 soil water and plant water sampling all water isotopic signatures were measured with a wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectrometer picarro l2130i santa clara usa from here on referred to as picarro isotope values are expressed in δ notation in per mill given in eq 1 1 δ 2 h o r δ 18 o r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample is the ratio 2h 1h or 18o 16o of the less abundant to the more abundant isotope of the sample and rstandard the ratio 2h 1h or 18o 16o in a standard respectively injection numbers were adjusted to the expected deuterium concentrations of the sample i e samples expected to be enriched we increased the injection number to 8 in the high throughput mode and the first five measurements were discarded per 105 samples 17 laboratory standards were analyzed and calibrated against vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water slap standard light antarctic precipitation and gisp greenland ice sheet precipitation water standards iaea vienna austria data correction was conducted using chemcorrecttm picarro 2010 flags indicating contamination were checked and excluded from further analysis samples thought to contain organic compounds xylem sap suction cup samples were filtered through sterile pes polyethersulfone syringe filters 0 45 µm carl roth gmbh co kg karlsruhe germany prior to measuring to determine tracer throughput and root water uptake rwu soil water and xylem sap of selected trees was sampled for isotope analysis branches were harvested by tree climbers from the sun crowns of the individual trees to collect branch xylem sap bark and phloem were peeled off and water was extracted using a scholander pressure chamber scholander 1966 as previously described rennenberg et al 1996 this method has previously been used to extract xylem water from branches and was favored over cryogenic extraction due to likely lower organic contamination geißler et al 2019 the authors also did not find differences in the isotopic composition between samples extracted with the pressure chamber and vacuum extraction furthermore to compare the physiological performance and water status of trees the water potential of harvested branches ψplant was measured with the same instrument sampling was conducted from july until october 2017 during two field campaigns 6th 28th july and 17th august 11th october representing the time frames of the two experiments to collect soil water two different methods were used and compared destructive soil sampling with subsequent cryogenic extraction from here on referred to as soil extraction and water extracted from the soil matrix via suction cups sk20 and sks20 meter group munich germany at a vacuum of approx 0 8 bar potential differences due to methodological artifacts are likely to be in a magnitude up to 3 and 0 9 for δd and δ18o respectively thoma et al 2018 and are therefor likely irrelevant during the precipitation and deep soil layer experiment as the applied label was so strongly enriched 1600 and 6000 δd respectively furthermore during the deep label experiment only deep water sources obtained by the suction cups were potential sources for plant water uptake as the upper soil layers could be physiologically excluded as potential sources in total 48 suction cups were installed on the plots at five different depths 0 2 0 3 0 5 1 2 and 1 7 m in march 2017 destructive soil sampling was conducted with a soil corer between 0 and 0 25 m depth at intervals of 0 05 m to get a higher resolution of the tracer distribution in the upper soil layers n 3 per plot soil samples were frozen and subsequently extracted using a custom built cryogenic vacuum extraction line dubbert et al 2013 the extraction time was 90 min at 95 c under a vacuum of 0 8 mbar and complete extraction was assessed by weighing extracted samples after extraction and again after drying at 105 c for 48 h thereby assessing the leftover water content in the samples in all cases the extraction was complete precipitation was collected with a rainwater collector installed 5 m above ground within the stand to obtain throughfall water signatures note this rain collector was not used to measure precipitation amount furthermore groundwater was sampled from a water spring 200 m downhill of the sampled stands at the foot of the slope 2 2 4 sap flow measurements sap flow sensors sfm1 type ict international pty ltd armidale australia based on the heat ratio method hrm were installed in june 2017 and xylem flow was measured at a resolution of 15 min from june to november 2017 the measurement principle is described in burgess et al 2000 2001 briefly two temperature sensors are fixed into the trees sapwood 5 mm above and below a line heater releasing a heat pulse every 15 min the heat pulse expansion ratio recorded after the pulse release is proportional to the heat pulse velocity vh cm h 1 as suggested in marshall 1958 raw data treatment and correction was conducted as described in pfautsch et al 2010 from raw sap velocities we calculated hourly and daily xylem sap flow per individual tree by incorporating sapwood depth bark width and wood density as well as corrections for probe misalignment i e correction for zero baseline offsets described in magh et al 2019 finally we averaged sap velocities over pure beech and mixed beech fir plots also as previously described in magh et al 2019 a power out caused the loss of the sap flow rates for firs in the control group which were assessed by comparing the flow rates of the same trees to their previous year flow rates which did not differ see magh et al 2019 2 3 statistics differences in δd signatures of xylem sap and ψplant between plant species or associations were tested with the unpaired wilcoxon signed rank test w and spearman s rank correlation ρ the same tests were conducted for δd signature of soil water swc and ψm two hour mean values of meteorological data swc and ψm were calculated to allow comparisons of data with xylem sap and ψplant differences between these parameters were considered significant when p 0 05 we used general additive models gam to detect differences in the time course of xylem sap isotopic signatures between species and association data were transformed using a boxcox transformation to achieve normal distribution of residuals based on changes in sampling intensity and intervals of xylem sap collection values were standardized by using a single value per sampling day wood 2017a b 2011 residual tracer water from the first experiment was detected in the xylem sap of two out of three firs just before the start of the second experiment we standardized these data with the xylem sap signatures of the fir not revealing any tracer signature for plotting purposes only therefore the absolute difference between the first measurement point on august 17th of the two firs indicating tracer use and the one that did not was subtracted from every measurement point thereafter these corrected data were used for plotting purposes and for detecting time course differences of xylem δd signatures gam model but not for the calculation of the rwu depths for which we used the original xylem signature data to calculate rwu depths we used an simple linear mixing slm model within a bayesian framework parnell et al 2013 2010 in r simmr package by parnell 2019 the input for this model required data for mixtures i e isotopic signatures of the xylem sap the sources i e the soil depth isotopic signature and the sources standard deviation we additionally defined two model restrictions to ensure physiological suitability of the mixing model i we calculated the water travel time using the trees height m and sap velocity m h 1 resulting in a tree specific time lag d between transpiration and rwu enabling us to use the soil water isotopic signature of the respective day derived from the respective time lag and ii we defined the lowest most negative ψplant as the maximum water potential at which the specific tree would be able to extract water from the soil ψplantmax if ψm ψplantmax we excluded the corresponding soil depth from contributing we did not sample soil water deeper than 0 25 m on the pure beech plot but would like to include modeled rwu depths for the pure beech stand in this manuscript therefore we used the seven soil water replica e g soil depth 0 5 m was sampled 7x by suction cups over the plot for each depth obtained via suction cups in the mixed stand exhibiting a very homogeneous pattern thus we used the differences in the upper soil layers between the mixed and the pure stand over time to correct the infiltration of tracer beneath the pure stand and used these corrected data as input for the rwu we are aware that these input data might not reflect water relations at the time of measurement at full certainty due to possible heterogeneity in infiltration patterns into the soil caused by the ability of trees to alter soil properties paluch and gruba 2012 nevertheless we would like to include the data as modeled rwu depths for the pure beech stand all statistics and plots were conducted and created in r r core team 2017 3 results meteorological conditions from july until the beginning of november were characterized by strongly fluctuating tair which was overall 2 25 c warmer compared to the long term average for this period dwd elzach fissnacht 30 year long term average 1981 2010 in july 2017 precipitation was considerably higher compared to the long term average δ 62 mm the first field campaign from 6th 20th july was characterized by constantly changing weather conditions with tair fluctuations of up to 10 c within five days and convective precipitation events up to 25 mm in 2 h fig 1 also the second sampling campaign from mid august to the end of october was characterized by strong differences in tair fig 1 from the installation of the rain shelters until the beginning of the first experiment in july the swc declined strongly reaching lowest states at the end of july that were maintained until the first tracer irrigation event in mid august fig 2 a in accordance with swc ψm decreased during the first experiment starting on 6th july fig 2b neither swc nor ψm correlated with rainfall during times of roof coverage data not shown confirming that rain exclusion was mostly successful as indicated in fig 2a two precipitation events caused the rain shelters to leak and allowed water to infiltrate the soil beneath however we were able to fix the rain shelters contemporarily preventing water from reaching soil layers deeper than 15 cm fig 2a 3 1 deep soil layer labelling first experiment the rain shelters protected the soil from precipitation for a period of approx three months after one and a half months we measured soil water and xylem sap signatures prior to the introduction of tracer to obtain the natural abundance water signatures of trees and soil in the stands the results are summarized in table s1 beech trees revealed the tendency towards slightly more depleted xylem sap signatures mean sd 52 5 3 3 δd 7 6 0 7 δ18o n 8 respectively than firs mean sd 50 8 1 7 δd 7 0 5 δ18o n 9 respectively before the tracer application soil water signatures before tracer application ranged from 33 to 61 δd and from 4 7 to 9 δ18o indicating the natural variability within the ecosystem table s2 on july 6th we introduced 300l of deuterated water 6000 δd into the sheltered mixed beech fir stand at a depth of 1 7 m for a period of 14 days we obtained soil water and xylem sap over a daily course for the first four days and every third day thereafter during that time we did not recover any tracer signal in the xylem sap nor in soil depth lower than 1 2 m except one suction cup installed in 1 2 m at 1 7 m depth we recovered water signatures between 25 δd on july 10th four days after tracer application and 212 on the 20th we thus found the data obtained during the first experiment suitable to characterize the natural abundance water signatures within the mixed beech fir forest stand during the dry down phase prior to the labeling experiment fig 3 water from more shallow soil depths tended to plot slightly below the lmwl while deeper soil water signatures plotted closer to the water obtained from a close by well groundwater fig 3 xylem sap of beeches and firs also revealed signatures deviating from the lmwl with an offset indicating slightly more enriched water signatures on average welsh two sample t test p value 2 2 9 for firs table 1 the intersection point fig 3 of both species xylem sap signatures with the lmwl was closest to the deeper soil waters i e 1 2 m and deep water at the intersection ψplant varied greatly over the daily course 0 5 to 2 5 mpa for individual trees table s3 ψplantmax for beeches was 2mpa during the time of experiment 1 and 2 1 mpa for firs we correlated ψplant ψm and soil moisture with tair and vpd fig s1 over the time course of the experiment ψplant from both species correlated negatively with tair and vpd revealing higher closer to 0 water potentials at times were vpd and tair was low fig s1 we also observed weak negative correlations of ψplant with ψm and soil moisture in the shallow soil layers fig s1 to calculate rwu using an slm model we built physiological restrictions based on ψplantmax and ψm to prevent soil depth from contributing to rwu if their ψm was lower than the ψplantmax additionally we implemented a travel time lag see statistics section to account for the time it takes the water to get transported from the uptake site to the site where xylem sap signatures were measured this time lag during the first experiment was approx 10d in beeches and 19d in firs thus we were only able to calculate rwu contributions to transpiration once during the first experiment table 2 differences in proportions of rwu between depth and species were not significant due to high standard deviations nevertheless the main uptake depth of firs was located at 0 5 m while beeches took up water from 0 5 and 1 2 m almost in equal share sap flow followed a typical daily course increasing during the day and decreasing at night but additionally revealed low flow rates at times where vpd was low fig s2 sap flow was reduced in beech trees of the mixed stands in the drought treatment by half compared to the control while for firs such an effect was not observed fig s2 we did not observe an impact of the tracer we introduced on the 6th 7th july on xylem sap flow as flow rates continued with the same diurnal pattern as before the tracer application 3 2 irrigation labelling 2nd experiment we used deuterated water 1600 δd to irrigate the mixed beech fir and pure beech stands for the first time after three month of rain exclusion on august 18th again we sampled trees over a daily course every two hours from 9am to 7 pm for five days afterwards every fourth to sixth day for 1 5 months soil water was obtained at the same interval but once per day two of the firs that were part of the first experiment revealed enriched xylem sap signatures before the beginning of the 2nd experiment and were thus standardized for plotting purposes in fig 4 see 2 3 see table s4 for the original data in the four days after irrigation none of the investigated trees did reveal a sign of tracer water in the xylem sap fig 4 beech trees in pure and mixed stands revealed enriched sap signatures 30 to 320 δd eight days after the first irrigation the response of firs was even more delayed as we did not observe changes in xylem sap signatures until 12d after irrigation we measured the highest mean tracer signatures in the xylem sap of beeches 12 pure 155 δd and 16 mixed 207 δd days after tracer application respectively in firs the maximum tracer concentration was measured after 22 days 196 δd thereafter tracer concentrations steadily declined reaching 57 and 92 δd for the xylem sap of beeches in the pure and mixed stand respectively when we stopped measurements at the beginning of leaf senescence on october 11th fig 4 in the xylem sap of firs we then still found high signatures of 124 δd differences in response time for both stands and species were statistically significant p 0 001 w furthermore differences were confirmed with gams in particular the delayed reaction of firs p 0 001 for stands and species with a general cross validation of 0 5 scale estimates of 0 5 and explained deviance of 90 we observed that water in the more shallow soil layers 0 05 to 0 15 m depth infiltrated quickly within the first two weeks reaching an enriched level around 0 δd until the end of the experiment fig s3 soil layers at greater depths tended to reveal signs of tracer either instantaneously or within one day after irrigation fig s3 e g 0 25 m vs 1 7 m maximum tracer concentrations were reached within the first two days after irrigation at all investigated soil depths with a subsequent decline mostly following an exponential or power function only for the 1 7 m depth tracer concentrations did not decrease until september 4th and remained at a higher level compared to the other soil depths fig s3 upper panel when comparing the soil infiltration patterns for the upper 0 25 m upper soil layers in the pure beech with the mixed beech fir stand in the pure stand no signs of tracer water were observed in depths 0 05 0 1 m four days after irrigation at the same time we observed that the litter layer of the pure beech stand was considerably thicker compared to the mixed beech fir stand in the mixed stand the infiltration was instantaneous at all soil depth investigated fig 5 for all soil depths please check fig s3 additionally the concentrations found in the first four days in the upper soil layers of the mixed stand were on average 100 δd higher compared to the pure stand p 0 05 for the upper soil layers of 0 05 and 0 1 m we observed that unlike in the three soil layers below the tracer concentration increased after the initial irrigation event in both pure and mixed stands fig 5 during the irrigation experiment ψplant varied at the same extend as during the first experiment 0 5 and 2 3 mpa over the daily course table s5 soil ψm indicated severe dry out of the shallow soil layers as the values ranged around 6mpa the day before the first irrigation event fig 2b as before we correlated ψplant ψm and soil moisture with each other and tair as well as vpd but this time we analyzed data separately for pure and mixed stands figs s4 and s5 respectively for the pure beech stand we found that ψplant correlated positively amongst each other and negatively with vpd and tair fig s4 three of five beeches correlated negatively with ψm in 0 2 and 0 3 m soil depth ψplant correlated positively with soil moisture of deeper but not or negatively with more shallow soil layers fig s4 in the mixed stand negative correlations of ψplant of beech trees with each other as well as with tair and vpd were even more pronounced fig s5 we did not observe strong correlations of ψplant with ψm but positive correlations of ψplant with soil moisture in the shallow soil layers though weak fig s5 a wilcoxon signed rank test confirmed significant higher more negative ψplant of beeches in the pure vs the mixed stand p 0 01 table s5 from ψplantmax 2 2 mpa for beeches in the pure stand and 2 3 mpa for beeches and firs in the mixed stand and ψm we built restrictions into the slm model calculating the rwu during and after the irrigation experiment we included a time lag calculated for each tree and averaged for the pure and the mixed beech stand as well as for firs in the mixed stand beeches in the pure stand took 17 beeches in the mixed stand 14 and firs in the mixed stand 22 days before water reached the tree crowns table s6 includes the sap velocities of grouped trees and the average travel times from june to october the calculated travel times fit the observed highest xylem sap signatures tracer peak well for beeches and firs in the mixed stand i e tracer peak mixed beech 16d after irrigation vs calculated travel time 17d tracer peak firs 21d after irrigation vs calculated travel time 21d while for beeches in the pure stand the calculated travel time was 2 days longer than the tracer peak i e tracer peak 11d after irrigation vs calculated travel time 13d table s6 fig 6 summarizes the water contributions of different soil depths to the treeś transpiration during the time course of the 2nd experiment water from deeper up to 1 2 m soil layers depicts the highest contribution in the first days after the first irrigation while for beeches in the mixed stand this holds true until the 9th for beeches in the pure stand until the 11th day after irrigation for firs more shallow 0 5 m and higher soil layers did not contribute until the 26th day after the first irrigation fig 6 hence neither species is tapping event water immediately also the response times of beeches and firs and the amount of soil water from deeper soil layers clearly differ between beeches and firs the contribution of water from 1 2 m averages at 60 for beeches in the pure stand when water uptake from more shallow soil layers is restricted while for firs contributions of deep water and water from 1 7 m clearly dominate water uptake fig 6 for beeches in the mixed stand the pattern is less clear as contributions from either source i e deep water 1 7 or 1 2 m dominate the 17 days after the first irrigation i e until 03th september the switch back to water contributions from more shallow soil layers took firs the longest however then the contributions of shallow and deeper soil layers reached a ratio of approx 60 40 i e 60 shallow and 40 deeper soil layer contribution and did not vary much thereafter beeches in the pure stand gradually shifted back to water uptake from more shallow soil layers with soil depths down to 0 5 m contributed 60 and more on average fig 6 in the mixed beech stand the water uptake switchback to more shallow soil layers went gradually but deeper soil layers kept on contributing large amounts so that shallower soil layers contributed to a maximum of 50 to the water uptake fig 6 sap flow rates differed between treatment and control stands with the drought treatment reducing the flow rates of beech trees in the mixed stands by half fig s6 the first simulated precipitation event did not have an immediate effect on the sap flow rates in neither of the beech trees on the tenth day after the first irrigation sap flow in the pure beech stand exposed to drought reached the same level as the control stand for beech trees in the mixed stand exposed to drought we also observed an increase in sap flow relative to the control but not as pronounced as in the pure stand fig s6 sap flow rates of firs did not change toward neither the first nor the second simulated precipitation event generally sap flow rates decreased steadily from mid august until october irrespective of treatment fig s6 4 discussion in the present study we investigated water use strategies of mature stands of fagus sylvatica with and without co cultivation of abies alba during a simulated summer drought and subsequent simulated heavy precipitation in a temperate forest in south west germany to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate root water uptake in a mature temperate forest ecosystem subjected to drying wetting cycles we showed that both species used water from deep soil layers during drought experiment 1 though for beeches the contribution of deep soil layers to water supply was not able to support the transpiration demand the transpiration of firs remained unaffected by drought probably due to a mixture of an isohydric water use strategy and the taproot system the reactions towards high intensity irrigation differed among species but also between beeches of the pure and mixed stands indicating competition between beech trees and firs in the mixed stand experiment 2 4 1 including restrictions into the slm model increases its physiological relevance the incorporation of a travel time lag for water transport within the tree resulted in different soil water input depth for the slm model used to calculate rwu depths berry et al 2018 sprenger et al 2019 consequently the rwu revealed different results of water uptake from the soil commonly slm models are applied using programs such as mixsir moore and semmens 2008 siar parnell et al 2010 and simmr parnell 2016 these models even though providing consistent statistical grounds lack mechanistic insight and do not reflect underlying processes affecting source contributions ogle et al 2014 2004 hence we a priori filtered data based on the treeś sap velocity thereby introducing a tree specific time lag which resulted in more delayed response for firs compared to beeches in accordance with generally higher transport rates and thus turnover times in deciduous trees than in conifers meinzer et al 2005 in a study of meinzer et al 2006 the authors fed d2o directly into the transpiration stream and calculated tracer velocities from the arrival of tracer at the transpiration site when compared to sap velocities the authors found that sap velocities severely underestimated the transport velocity in our study we related the tracer peak in the xylem sap to the highest tracer concentration in the soil when accounting for the calculated water travel time using sap velocities in beeches and firs of the mixed stand we argue that the mean sap velocity depicts the mean time it takes for most of a precipitate to get transported through the sapwood and reach the transpiration site thus it provides valuable information when predicting water travel times through forested ecosystems nevertheless we are aware that the sap velocity integrates over different vessel tracheid diameters and wood densities early vs latewood so that tracer water can be transported via preferential flow and partially reach transpiration sites earlier meinzer et al 2006 in order to identify potential water sources correctly we additionally restricted soil water uptake by roots when ψm ψplantmax i e changing the prior information for the model input lobet et al 2014 rothfuss and javaux 2017 this approach was chosen to adapt the model input data for the feasible range trees can extract water from the soil it restricted shallow soil layers down to 0 5 m from contributing to transpiration during the drought treatment and at the beginning of the irrigation experiment thereby enlarging the contributions of deep roots when shallow soil water availability is low ellsworth and sternberg 2015 as has been previously observed for beech trees by brinkmann et al 2018 and allen et al 2019 but not for firs 4 2 beech trees and firs use water from deeper soil layers during drought soil water uptake depths are linked to rooting patterns and active root areas ogle et al 2004 beech trees are reported to have most of their root biomass in the uppermost 30 cm of the soil and generally root down to 1 m schmid and kazda 2001 while firs preferably root between 20 and 80 cm soil depth potępa et al 2018 we were able to show that the source water for shallow soil layers and xylem sap is not the same during drought to this end isotopic signatures of shallow soil layers probably reflect precipitation signatures in combination with evaporative fractionation due to rain exclusion isotope signatures of water in xylem sap rather reflect the mixture of water from mostly deep soil layers as supported by modeling rwu depths hence both species were able to take up water from deeper soil layers during drought indicating high plasticity of water uptake patterns the use of water from deeper soil layers has previously been observed for mature beech trees in switzerland allen et al 2019 brinkmann et al 2019 where soil moisture decreased in the uppermost soil layers and beech was able to switch water uptake to deeper soil layers generally it is a well established pattern in arid semiarid regions or regions subjected to seasonal droughts bréda et al 1995 dawson and pate 1996 eggemeyer et al 2008 garnier et al 1986 markewitz et al 2010 to gradually shift water uptake downward when the upper soil dries out under these conditions roots growing deeper into the soil ensure overnight recovery of the treeś water potential equilibrium bréda et al 1995 thereby supporting tree transpiration in times of low swc and high vpd however even though beech trees were able to switch their water uptake to deeper soil layers drought severely reduced their sap flow rates indicating that water uptake from deep soil layers was not able to support their transpiration demand brinkmann et al 2016 magh et al 2019 firs on the other hand were affected marginally by drought as their transpiration rates remained fairly constant we account this to i the taproot system of firs indicating a higher plasticity in water uptake depth of firs compared to beech trees and ii the more isohydric strategy of firs to safe water during times of low soil moisture bréda et al 2006 camarero et al 2015 4 3 beeches transpire water from shallow soil layers faster than firs upon irrigation beeches in the pure stand recovered transpiration to the rates of the control group supporting the observation that transpiration will be reduced under stress conditions e g hanson todd and amthor 2001 and that the recovery of water use by beeches subjected to drought can be complete kunz et al 2016 sánchez gómez et al 2013 tognetti et al 1995 kunz et al 2016 studied responses of beech seedlings to drought and subsequent rewetting and found rates of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis to recover fully within three days another study found full recovery in beech seedlings only after 48 days sánchez gómez et al 2013 in a study with mature beech trees dietrich and kahmen 2019 found that even small drought intermitting rainfall events were able to increase sap flow rates indicating that recovery from drought can be instantaneous our data suggest that 11 days are required for full recovery of sap flow rates at the field site studied as indicated by the tracer peak in the xylem sap water additionally a constant fine root turnover strategy in beech trees as observed by mainiero and kazda 2006 supports the faster response of water transport by beech trees to precipitation after drought unaffected sap flow rates of firs in response to the irrigation could be attributed to the aforementioned isohydric water use strategy in combination with a sufficient water supply by the taproot system lower hydraulic conductivity of the xylem tissues of firs is a likely explanation for the delayed observation of tracer water in the xylem sap dietrich and kahmen 2019 meidner and sheriff 1976 a delayed response of deeper rooted species toward precipitation after drought has also previously been reported by volkmann et al 2016 in investigations with oak seedlings the authors attributed this finding to an inactivation of the topsoil fine root system a strategy previously reported for juniperus and pinus eggemeyer et al 2008 and three evergreen conifers yang et al 2015 here lower hydraulic conductivity of the xylem tissue is conceivable to explain the delayed response to the irrigation after drought the advantages of this process are associated with wider hydraulic safety margins making conifers generally less prone to drought induced cavitation but come at the cost of carbon gain carnicer et al 2013 choat et al 2012 4 4 water in mixed beech fir stands is subject to competition water transport of beech trees in the mixed stands was apparently not able to recover from drought as sap flow rates remained reduced by half after the irrigation until the end of our experiment while beech trees in the pure stand once water uptake from the topsoil was re established used around 70 of water from more shallow soil depths beech trees in the mixed stand obtained only 50 whereas firs used around 70 of the water in shallow soil layers also we found beeches in the mixed stands revealing significantly lower ψplant than those in the mixed stand these observation and the inability of beeches in the mixed stand to recover sap flow rates upon irrigation after drought to levels of the control is surprising since beech is considered to be a very competitive species above longuetaud et al 2013 and belowground rewald and leuschner 2009 at high and low productivity sites toïgo et al 2015 it seems though that drought can constrain this competitiveness of beech trees in mixed stands with fir so that beeches were not able to recover when water supply was restored these observations indicate higher interspecific competition within the mixed stand than the aforementioned intraspecific competition of beech in the pure stand since stand densities were similar between the pure and mixed stand and can therefore be excluded as a potential cause of water relief in the pure stand one possible explanation for this competition situation could be the aforementioned wider hydraulic safety margin of the conifer avoiding the drought stress and therefore avoiding drought induced cavitation carnicer et al 2013 choat et al 2012 while beeches as angiosperms are found to be more susceptible towards drought induced cavitation brodribb et al 2012 which in turn reduces their hydraulic conductivity explaining the inability to regain high transpiration rates in the mixed stands in the pure beech stand the thicker litter layer might have prevented soil moisture from crossing a critical threshold explaining why beeches here did regain high rates of transpiration this indication of competition of beech and fir for water resources seems to contradict previous findings suggesting facilitative effects of fir on beech magh et al 2018a however the study of magh et al 2018 was conducted in a year without drought using an approach that integrated water relations during leaf lifetime thus drought might be able to turn long term facilitative effects of fir on beech into competition when water supply gets limited 5 conclusion during times of drought both beech and fir trees reveal high water use plasticity shifting their water uptake depth toward deeper and moister soil layers while this shift is sufficient to support firs transpiration demand the water demand is still not met in beech trees either in mixed or pure stands underlining its drought sensitivity betsch et al 2011 leuschner et al 2001 leuzinger et al 2005 once water supply had been restored beeches in monospecific stands were able to recover both water uptake from shallow soil layers and sap flow rates while in the mixed stand beeches competed unsuccessfully with fir for water as indicated by still reduced sap flow rates and inconsistent rwu patterns thus the facilitative effect of silver fir on water relations of beech trees as has been proposed in earlier studies magh et al 2018a rehschuh et al 2019 was likely disrupted by drought and turned into competition for water resources projecting this finding into a climate change exposed future suggests a very careful consideration

5417,in the present study we investigated water use strategies of mature stands of fagus sylvatica european beech with and without co cultivation of abies alba silver fir during a summer drought and subsequent rewetting through simulated heavy precipitation in a temperate forest in south west germany we used a combination of sap flow analysis water stable isotope labeling and a simple linear mixing model with physiological restrictions to determine whether both species were able to switch water uptake depths during drought and reverse this switch after restoration of water supply we showed that both species utilized water from relatively deep soil layers 0 5 m during the drought phase though for beech trees these contributions were not able to support the high transpiration demands in contrast the transpiration of firs remained unaffected by drought probably due to a mixture of its isohydric water use strategy and taproot system the reactions towards high intensity irrigation differed among species but also between beeches of the pure and mixed stands while beech trees in the pure stand once water uptake from the topsoil was re established used 70 of water from more shallow soil depths and were able to restore transpiration beech trees in the mixed stand obtained only 50 and transpiration decreased further firs used around 70 of the water in shallow soil layers and transpiration rates again remained unaffected these differences indicate competition between beech trees and firs in the mixed stand upon drought we conclude that drought is able to disrupt water relations in mixed temperate forested ecosystems in such a way that facilitation can turn into competition for resources like water abbreviations slm simple linear mixed model swc soil water

uptake 1 introduction mixed species forests are often related to increased productivity pretzsch et al 2013a b 2015 thereby providing higher carbon sinks ruiz benito et al 2014 higher ecological value jactel et al 2017 and reduction of drought sensibility lebourgeois et al 2013 or faster drought recovery schwarz and bauhus 2019 the functional traits enabling mixed species stands to be more resistant towards drought have often been associated with partitioning of resources such as water or nutrients forrester 2014 this niche partitioning might be a key feature when trying to adapt forested ecosystems towards increasing number of extreme events such as heat and drought ipcc 2013 therefore it is not surprising that the future performance of native tree species under a changing climate is frequently discussed and associated with the promotion of mixing tree species bmel 2014 lindner et al 2010 pretzsch et al 2014 the most abundant and dominant deciduous tree species in temperate latitudes is fagus sylvatica l european beech from here on referred to as beech described as drought sensitive fotelli et al 2003 mérian and lebourgeois 2011 particularly due to its relatively shallow rooting system extending vertically to about 1 m with a maximum rooting density between 0 1 and 0 2 m schmid and kazda 2001 therefore there is an ongoing discussion about silvicultural management concepts to stabilize this native tree species and its ecosystems one of the most common concepts is the diversification of forest stands including natural regeneration and facilitation of mixed stands morin et al 2011 pretzsch et al 2013a b toïgo et al 2015 pure and mixed stands can differ significantly in attributes and interactions within the critical zone due to the species specific capability of trees to modify their environment in this regard trees are able to alter soil microclimate aussenac 2000 amount and quality of leaf and root litter augusto et al 2002 rooting depths köstler et al 1968 schmid and kazda 2001 and thus change soil infiltration rates and water storage capacities of soils lange et al 2013 therefore various studies investigated the mixing effect of different tree species on e g soil properties paluch and gruba 2012 tree growth lebourgeois et al 2013 forest productivity pretzsch et al 2013a b and drought tolerance zang et al 2014 the summer heatwaves and droughts of 2003 and 2015 in central europe were demonstrations of the extent that climate change will likely have on forest ecosystems in the near future ciais et al 2005 ionita et al 2017 ipcc 2014 contrarily to beech trees abies alba mill silver fir from here on referred to as fir is described as relative resilient to drought due to its deep taproot system able to reach depths of up to 3 m brosinger et al 2004 köstler et al 1968 an adaption playing a key role for the melioration of drought therefore one aim of this study was to elucidate if this trait would enable firs to switch water uptake from more shallow towards deeper and presumably moister soil layers when exposed to prolonged drought and if this switch in water supply depth was constrained in beech trees without taproot system besides the predicted higher number of drought events an increased frequency of heavy precipitation events especially after prolonged droughts so called drying wetting cycles will have strong impacts on forests of temperate latitudes in the future gessler et al 2006 lindner et al 2010 the question arises how trees cope with these extreme conditions which strategies do they favor and is there evidence for a universal approach of different tree species while reaction and adaption strategies of tree water use to drought are generally well studied e g david et al 2013 brunner et al 2015 brinkmann et al 2016 there are only few field studies on responses of tree water use to drying wetting cycles e g volkmann et al 2016 volkmann et al 2016 investigated the response of juvenile quercus petraea and juvenile fagus sylvatica l to drought with subsequent precipitation using stable isotopes as a tracer in the precipitate they found that the juvenile deciduous trees were able to switch water uptake between soil depths and are able to take up large amounts of event water fast as a second aim of the present study we wanted to elucidate if this ability was still present in mature beech and fir trees and could compensate for the reduced water supply during extended drought to address these aims we comparatively analyzed water relations of mature beech trees in monospecific stands and in stands mixed with fir in the black forest south west germany due to its major importance for forests in this region covering approximately 45 of the forest area kändler and cullman 2016 hereby we compared water uptake and sap flow rates of beech and fir trees under simulated drought conditions experiment 1 and subsequent simulated heavy precipitation experiment 2 within the vegetation period of 2017 drought conditions were simulated by excluding precipitation for three months using rain shelters during the dry down phase we a characterized water uptake by roots and the transpiration fluxes of trees and b determined if both tree species i e beech and fir are able to utilize water from deep soil layers using water stable isotopes to simulate precipitation after drought we irrigated pure and mixed stands of beech with water enriched in deuterium and compared the isotopic composition of xylem sap with soil water as previously described by volkmann et al 2016 furthermore we investigated the effect of fir on beech trees by comparing beech trees in pure and mixed stands regarding the amount of event water uptake response time and soil infiltration patterns in addition to using stable water isotopes as a tracer in soil and xylem we used sap flow as a proxy for transpiration to link isotope data with xylem sap fluxes 2 materials and methods 2 1 field site and environmental data experiments were conducted at the freiamt fieldsite on the foothills of the black forest in south west germany described in detail by magh et al 2018b briefly the site is characterized by a temperate climate with an annual average air temperature tair of 9 5 c and an average precipitation of 1 110 mm a dwd elzach fissnacht 30 year long term average 1981 2010 the forest is defined as a beech conifer association with beech being the dominant species 70 beech 15 fir 15 larch trees studied were between 20 and 25 m high at an average age of 50 60 years no grass or shrub layer was detected during the study period which is in accordance with long term observations personal communication forstamt emmedingen 04 10 2017 the soil is about 1 m deep

roots have been observed to occur below the fragipan commencing soil at 1 m depth soil texture is defined as sandy loam which implements moderate water availability for plants world reference base for soil resources iuss 2015 meteorological parameters such as tair precipitation and relative humidity rh were retrieved continuously from a meteorological station of enbw freiamt which was installed in vicinity 600 m to the stand vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from tair and rh using the magnus equation alduchov and eskridge 1996 2 2 experimental setup to simulate drought in the stands rain shelters were installed on 22nd may 2017 in order to minimize disturbance with regard to solar radiation tair and soil atmosphere gas exchange rain shelters were built from transparent foil polydress 150 µm rkw se frankenthal germany they were installed around selected trees in 1 5 1 7 m height and tightened around the stems using cable ties and duct tape to prevent stem flow from reaching the ground volumetric water content of the soil swc was measured continuously in five different depths 0 1 0 15 0 25 0 5 0 8 m gs1 and 5tm meter group munich germany at six spots within the

munich germany calibrated with gravimetric water content measurements and an estimation of a water retention curve din iso 11274 for the particular soil at the field site to obtain a comprehensive picture of the water relation at the field sites we conducted two different experiments each time using water stable isotopes as a tracer both experiments were conducted at the same plots and are described below but since soil water and plant water sampling was conducted in the same way for both experimental parts it is described at the end of this section 2 2 1 deep soil layer labeling experiment 1 to determine shifts in water uptake depths during the dry down phase enriched tracer water was introduced at 1 7 m eleven holes were drilled around the tree stems and stabilized using plastic pipes overall 300 l tracer water with a concentration of 6000 δd deuterium oxide sigma aldrich chemistry st louis usa were poured into the pipes down to 1 7 m depth between july 6th and july 7th water application was conducted every two hours with one liter per pipe to prevent flooding during the first five days after tracer application xylem sap n 3 beeches and n 3 firs was sampled at a two hour interval between 07 00am 09 00 pm n 9 per tree afterwards sampling was conducted twice per week taking only a single measurement per day and tree until the 20th july 2 2 2 irrigation labelling experiment 2 to investigate the response in water uptake patterns upon precipitation after drought we chose a two step irrigation event one of 40 mm with 1600 δd deuterium oxide sigma aldrich chemistry st louis usa on 18th august within 4 h and the other one ten days later as an event of 60 mm without labeling natural abundance signature of δd was 64 within 6 h we chose this approach to retain clearly distinguishable deuterium signatures within the soil to ensure even water distribution over the whole plot area lawn sprinklers were used and periodically changed in position during the first five days after the first irrigation event xylem sap n 3 beeches and firs in the mixed stand respectively and n 5 beeches in the pure beech stand was sampled at two hour intervals between 09 00am 07 00 pm subsequently sampling was conducted once or twice per week taking only a single measurement per tree and day to monitor water movement from the soil surface to deeper soil layers soil n 3 per soil depth and suction cups n 7 per soil depth were sampled daily until august 23rd and afterwards on a four day basis see section 2 2 3 2 2 3 soil water and plant water sampling all water isotopic signatures were measured with a wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectrometer picarro l2130i santa clara usa from here on referred to as picarro isotope values are expressed in δ notation in per mill given in eq 1 1 δ 2 h o r δ 18 o r sample r standard 1 1000 where rsample is the ratio 2h 1h or 18o 16o of the less abundant to the more abundant isotope of the sample and rstandard the ratio 2h 1h or 18o 16o in a standard respectively injection numbers were adjusted to the expected deuterium concentrations of the sample i e samples expected to be enriched we increased the injection number to 8 in the high throughput mode and the first five measurements were discarded per 105 samples 17 laboratory standards were analyzed and calibrated against vsmow vienna standard mean ocean water slap standard light antarctic precipitation and gisp greenland ice sheet precipitation water standards iaea vienna austria data correction was conducted using chemcorrecttm picarro 2010 flags indicating contamination were checked and excluded from further analysis samples thought to contain organic compounds xylem sap suction cup samples were filtered through sterile pes polyethersulfone syringe filters 0 45 µm carl roth gmbh co kg karlsruhe germany prior to measuring to determine tracer throughput and root water uptake rwu soil water and xylem sap of selected trees was sampled for isotope analysis branches were harvested by tree climbers from the sun crowns of the individual trees to collect branch xylem sap bark and phloem were peeled off and water was extracted using a scholander pressure chamber scholander 1966 as previously described rennenberg et al 1996 this method has previously been used to extract xylem water from branches and was favored over cryogenic extraction due to likely lower organic contamination geißler et al 2019 the authors also did not find differences in the isotopic composition between samples extracted with the pressure chamber and vacuum extraction furthermore to compare the physiological performance and water status of trees the water potential of harvested branches ψplant was measured with the same instrument sampling was conducted from july until october 2017 during two field campaigns 6th 28th july and 17th august 11th october representing the time frames of the two experiments to collect soil water two different methods were used and compared destructive soil sampling with subsequent cryogenic extraction from here on referred to as soil extraction and water extracted from the soil matrix via suction cups sk20 and sks20 meter group munich germany at a vacuum of approx 0 8 bar potential differences due to methodological artifacts are likely to be in a magnitude up to 3 and 0 9 for δd and δ18o respectively thoma et al 2018 and are therefor likely irrelevant during the precipitation and deep soil layer experiment as the applied label was so strongly enriched 1600 and 6000 δd respectively furthermore during the deep label experiment only deep water sources obtained by the suction cups were potential sources for plant water uptake as the upper soil layers could be physiologically excluded as potential sources in total 48 suction cups were installed on the plots at five different depths 0 2 0 3 0 5 1 2 and 1 7 m in march 2017 destructive soil sampling was conducted with a soil corer between 0 and 0 25 m depth at intervals of 0 05 m to get a higher resolution of the tracer distribution in the upper soil layers n 3 per plot soil samples were frozen and subsequently extracted using a custom built cryogenic vacuum extraction line dubbert et al 2013 the extraction time was 90 min at 95 c under a vacuum of 0 8 mbar and complete extraction was assessed by weighing extracted samples after extraction and again after drying at 105 c for 48 h thereby assessing the leftover water content in the samples in all cases the extraction was complete precipitation was collected with a rainwater collector installed 5 m above ground within the stand to obtain throughfall water signatures note this rain collector was not used to measure precipitation amount furthermore groundwater was sampled from a water spring 200 m downhill of the sampled stands at the foot of the slope 2 2 4 sap flow measurements sap flow sensors sfm1 type ict international pty ltd armidale australia based on the heat ratio method hrm were installed in june 2017 and xylem flow was measured at a resolution of 15 min from june to november 2017 the measurement principle is described in burgess et al 2000 2001 briefly two temperature sensors are fixed into the trees sapwood 5 mm above and below a line heater releasing a heat pulse every 15 min the heat pulse expansion ratio recorded after the pulse release is proportional to the heat pulse velocity vh cm h 1 as suggested in marshall 1958 raw data treatment and correction was conducted as described in pfautsch et al 2010 from raw sap velocities we calculated hourly and daily xylem sap flow per individual tree by incorporating sapwood depth bark width and wood density as well as corrections for probe misalignment i e correction for zero baseline offsets described in magh et al 2019 finally we averaged sap velocities over pure beech and mixed beech fir plots also as previously described in magh et al 2019 a power out caused the loss of the sap flow rates for firs in the control group which were assessed by comparing the flow rates of the same trees to their previous year flow rates which did not differ see magh et al 2019 2 3 statistics differences in δd signatures of xylem sap and ψplant between plant species or associations were tested with the unpaired wilcoxon signed rank test w and spearman s rank correlation ρ the same tests were conducted for δd signature of soil water swc and ψm two hour mean values of meteorological data swc and ψm were calculated to allow comparisons of data with xylem sap and ψplant differences between these parameters were considered significant when p 0 05 we used general additive models gam to detect differences in the time course of xylem sap isotopic signatures between species and association data were transformed using a boxcox transformation to achieve normal distribution of residuals based on changes in sampling intensity and intervals of xylem sap collection values were standardized by using a single value per sampling day wood 2017a b 2011 residual tracer water from the first experiment was detected in the xylem sap of two out of three firs just before the start of the second experiment we standardized these data with the xylem sap signatures of the fir not revealing any tracer signature for plotting purposes only therefore the absolute difference between the first measurement point on august 17th of the two firs indicating tracer use and the one that did not was subtracted from every measurement point thereafter these corrected data were used for plotting purposes and for detecting time course differences of xylem δd signatures gam model but not for the calculation of the rwu depths for which we used the original xylem signature data to calculate rwu depths we used an simple linear mixing slm model within a bayesian framework parnell et al 2013 2010 in r simmr package by parnell 2019 the input for this model required data for mixtures i e isotopic signatures of the xylem sap the sources i e the soil depth isotopic signature and the sources standard deviation we additionally defined two model restrictions to ensure physiological suitability of the mixing model i we calculated the water travel time using the trees height m and sap velocity m h 1 resulting in a tree specific time lag d between transpiration and rwu enabling us to use the soil water isotopic signature of the respective day derived from the respective time lag and ii we defined the lowest most negative ψplant as the maximum water potential at which the specific tree would be able to extract water from the soil ψplantmax if ψm ψplantmax we excluded the corresponding soil depth from contributing we did not sample soil water deeper than 0 25 m on the pure beech plot but would like to include modeled rwu depths for the pure beech stand in this manuscript therefore we used the seven soil water replica e g soil depth 0 5 m was sampled 7x by suction cups over the plot for each depth obtained via suction cups in the mixed stand exhibiting a very homogeneous pattern thus we used the differences in the upper soil layers between the mixed and the pure stand over time to correct the infiltration of tracer beneath the pure stand and used these corrected data as input for the rwu we are aware that these input data might not reflect water relations at the time of measurement at full certainty due to possible heterogeneity in infiltration patterns into the soil caused by the ability of trees to alter soil properties paluch and gruba 2012 nevertheless we would like to include the data as modeled rwu depths for the pure beech stand all statistics and plots were conducted and created in r r core team 2017 3 results meteorological conditions from july until the beginning of november were characterized by strongly fluctuating tair which was overall 2 25 c warmer compared to the long term average for this period dwd elzach fissnacht 30 year long term average 1981 2010 in july 2017 precipitation was considerably higher compared to the long term average δ 62 mm the first field campaign from 6th 20th july was characterized by constantly changing weather conditions with tair fluctuations of up to 10 c within five days and convective precipitation events up to 25 mm in 2 h fig 1 also the second sampling campaign from mid august to the end of october was characterized by strong differences in tair fig 1 from the installation of the rain shelters until the beginning of the first experiment in july the swc declined strongly reaching lowest states at the end of july that were maintained until the first tracer irrigation event in mid august fig 2 a in accordance with swc ψm decreased during the first experiment starting on 6th july fig 2b neither swc nor ψm correlated with rainfall during times of roof coverage data not shown confirming that rain exclusion was mostly successful as indicated in fig 2a two precipitation events caused the rain shelters to leak and allowed water to infiltrate the soil beneath however we were able to fix the rain shelters contemporarily preventing water from reaching soil layers deeper than 15 cm fig 2a 3 1 deep soil layer labelling first experiment the rain shelters protected the soil from precipitation for a period of approx three months after one and a half months we measured soil water and xylem sap signatures prior to the introduction of tracer to obtain the natural abundance water signatures of trees and soil in the stands the results are summarized in table s1 beech trees revealed the tendency towards slightly more depleted xylem sap signatures mean sd 52 5 3 3 δd 7 6 0 7 δ18o n 8 respectively than firs mean sd 50 8 1 7 δd 7 0 5 δ18o n 9 respectively before the tracer application soil water signatures before tracer application ranged from 33 to 61 δd and from 4 7 to 9 δ18o indicating the natural variability within the ecosystem table s2 on july 6th we introduced 300l of deuterated water 6000 δd into the sheltered mixed beech fir stand at a depth of 1 7 m for a period of 14 days we obtained soil water and xylem sap over a daily course for the first four days and every third day thereafter during that time we did not recover any tracer signal in the xylem sap nor in soil depth lower than 1 2 m except one suction cup installed in 1 2 m at 1 7 m depth we recovered water signatures between 25 δd on july 10th four days after tracer application and 212 on the 20th we thus found the data obtained during the first experiment suitable to characterize the natural abundance water signatures within the mixed beech fir forest stand during the dry down phase prior to the labeling experiment fig 3 water from more shallow soil depths tended to plot slightly below the lmwl while deeper soil water signatures plotted closer to the water obtained from a close by well groundwater fig 3 xylem sap of beeches and firs also revealed signatures deviating from the lmwl with an offset indicating slightly more enriched water signatures on average welsh two sample t test p value 2 2 9 for firs table 1 the intersection point fig 3 of both species xylem sap signatures with the lmwl was closest to the deeper soil waters i e 1 2 m and deep water at the intersection ψplant varied greatly over the daily course 0 5 to 2 5 mpa for individual trees table s3 ψplantmax for beeches was 2mpa during the time of experiment 1 and 2 1 mpa for firs we correlated ψplant ψm and soil moisture with tair and vpd fig s1 over the time course of the experiment ψplant from both species correlated negatively with tair and vpd revealing higher closer to 0 water potentials at times were vpd and tair was low fig s1 we also observed weak negative correlations of ψplant with ψm and soil moisture in the shallow soil layers fig s1 to calculate rwu using an slm model we built physiological restrictions based on ψplantmax and ψm to prevent soil depth from contributing to rwu if their ψm was lower than the ψplantmax additionally we implemented a travel time lag see statistics section to account for the time it takes the water to get transported from the uptake site to the site where xylem sap signatures were measured this time lag during the first experiment was approx 10d in beeches and 19d in firs thus we were only able to calculate rwu contributions to transpiration once during the first experiment table 2 differences in proportions of rwu between depth and species were not significant due to high standard deviations nevertheless the main uptake depth of firs was located at 0 5 m while beeches took up water from 0 5 and 1 2 m almost in equal share sap flow followed a typical daily course increasing during the day and decreasing at night but additionally revealed low flow rates at times where vpd was low fig s2 sap flow was reduced in beech trees of the mixed stands in the drought treatment by half compared to the control while for firs such an effect was not observed fig s2 we did not observe an impact of the tracer we introduced on the 6th 7th july on xylem sap flow as flow rates continued with the same diurnal pattern as before the tracer application 3 2 irrigation labelling 2nd experiment we used deuterated water 1600 δd to irrigate the mixed beech fir and pure beech stands for the first time after three month of rain exclusion on august 18th again we sampled trees over a daily course every two hours from 9am to 7 pm for five days afterwards every fourth to sixth day for 1 5 months soil water was obtained at the same interval but once per day two of the firs that were part of the first experiment revealed enriched xylem sap signatures before the beginning of the 2nd experiment and were thus standardized for plotting purposes in fig 4 see 2 3 see table s4 for the original data in the four days after irrigation none of the investigated trees did reveal a sign of tracer water in the xylem sap fig 4 beech trees in pure and mixed stands revealed enriched sap signatures 30 to 320 δd eight days after the first irrigation the response of firs was even more delayed as we did not observe changes in xylem sap signatures until 12d after irrigation we measured the highest mean tracer signatures in the xylem sap of beeches 12 pure 155 δd and 16 mixed 207 δd days after tracer application respectively in firs the maximum tracer concentration was measured after 22 days 196 δd thereafter tracer concentrations steadily declined reaching 57 and 92 δd for the xylem sap of beeches in the pure and mixed stand respectively when we stopped measurements at the beginning of leaf senescence on october 11th fig 4 in the xylem sap of firs we then still found high signatures of 124 δd differences in response time for both stands and species were statistically significant p 0 001 w furthermore differences were confirmed with gams in particular the delayed reaction of firs p 0 001 for stands and species with a general cross validation of 0 5 scale estimates of 0 5 and explained deviance of 90 we observed that water in the more shallow soil layers 0 05 to 0 15 m depth infiltrated quickly within the first two weeks reaching an enriched level around 0 δd until the end of the experiment fig s3 soil layers at greater depths tended to reveal signs of tracer either instantaneously or within one day after irrigation fig s3 e g 0 25 m vs 1 7 m maximum tracer concentrations were reached within the first two days after irrigation at all investigated soil depths with a subsequent decline mostly following an exponential or power function only for the 1 7 m depth tracer concentrations did not decrease until september 4th and remained at a higher level compared to the other soil depths fig s3 upper panel when comparing the soil infiltration patterns for the upper 0 25 m upper soil layers in the pure beech with the mixed beech fir stand in the pure stand no signs of tracer water were observed in depths 0 05 0 1 m four days after irrigation at the same time we observed that the litter layer of the pure beech stand was considerably thicker compared to the mixed beech fir stand in the mixed stand the infiltration was instantaneous at all soil depth investigated fig 5 for all soil depths please check fig s3 additionally the concentrations found in the first four days in the upper soil layers of the mixed stand were on average 100 δd higher compared to the pure stand p 0 05 for the upper soil layers of 0 05 and 0 1 m we observed that unlike in the three soil layers below the tracer concentration increased after the initial irrigation event in both pure and mixed stands fig 5 during the irrigation experiment ψplant varied at the same extend as during the first experiment 0 5 and 2 3 mpa over the daily course table s5 soil ψm indicated severe dry out of the shallow soil layers as the values ranged around 6mpa the day before the first irrigation event fig 2b as before we correlated ψplant ψm and soil moisture with each other and tair as well as vpd but this time we analyzed data separately for pure and mixed stands figs s4 and s5 respectively for the pure beech stand we found that ψplant correlated positively amongst each other and negatively with vpd and tair fig s4 three of five beeches correlated negatively with ψm in 0 2 and 0 3 m soil depth ψplant correlated positively with soil moisture of deeper but not or negatively with more shallow soil layers fig s4 in the mixed stand negative correlations of ψplant of beech trees with each other as well as with tair and vpd were even more pronounced fig s5 we did not observe strong correlations of ψplant with ψm but positive correlations of ψplant with soil moisture in the shallow soil layers though weak fig s5 a wilcoxon signed rank test confirmed significant higher more negative ψplant of beeches in the pure vs the mixed stand p 0 01 table s5 from ψplantmax 2 2 mpa for beeches in the pure stand and 2 3 mpa for beeches and firs in the mixed stand and ψm we built restrictions into the slm model calculating the rwu during and after the irrigation experiment we included a time lag calculated for each tree and averaged for the pure and the mixed beech stand as well as for firs in the mixed stand beeches in the pure stand took 17 beeches in the mixed stand 14 and firs in the mixed stand 22 days before water reached the tree crowns table s6 includes the sap velocities of grouped trees and the average travel times from june to october the calculated travel times fit the observed highest xylem sap signatures tracer peak well for beeches and firs in the mixed stand i e tracer peak mixed beech 16d after irrigation vs calculated travel time 17d tracer peak firs 21d after irrigation vs calculated travel time 21d while for beeches in the pure stand the calculated travel time was 2 days longer than the tracer peak i e tracer peak 11d after irrigation vs calculated travel time 13d table s6 fig 6 summarizes the water contributions of different soil depths to the treeś transpiration during the time course of the 2nd experiment water from deeper up to 1 2 m soil layers depicts the highest contribution in the first days after the first irrigation while for beeches in the mixed stand this holds true until the 9th for beeches in the pure stand until the 11th day after irrigation for firs more shallow 0 5 m and higher soil layers did not contribute until the 26th day after the first irrigation fig 6 hence neither species is tapping event water immediately also the response times of beeches and firs and the amount of soil water from deeper soil layers clearly differ between beeches and firs the contribution of water from 1 2 m averages at 60 for beeches in the pure stand when water uptake from more shallow soil layers is restricted while for firs contributions of deep water and water from 1 7 m clearly dominate water uptake fig 6 for beeches in the mixed stand the pattern is less clear as contributions from either source i e deep water 1 7 or 1 2 m dominate the 17 days after the first irrigation i e until 03th september the switch back to water contributions from more shallow soil layers took firs the longest however then the contributions of shallow and deeper soil layers reached a ratio of approx 60 40 i e 60 shallow and 40 deeper soil layer contribution and did not vary much thereafter beeches in the pure stand gradually shifted back to water uptake from more shallow soil layers with soil depths down to 0 5 m contributed 60 and more on average fig 6 in the mixed beech stand the water uptake switchback to more shallow soil layers went gradually but deeper soil layers kept on contributing large amounts so that shallower soil layers contributed to a maximum of 50 to the water uptake fig 6 sap flow rates differed between treatment and control stands with the drought treatment reducing the flow rates of beech trees in the mixed stands by half fig s6 the first simulated precipitation event did not have an immediate effect on the sap flow rates in neither of the beech trees on the tenth day after the first irrigation sap flow in the pure beech stand exposed to drought reached the same level as the control stand for beech trees in the mixed stand exposed to drought we also observed an increase in sap flow relative to the control but not as pronounced as in the pure stand fig s6 sap flow rates of firs did not change toward neither the first nor the second simulated precipitation event generally sap flow rates decreased steadily from mid august until october irrespective of treatment fig s6 4 discussion in the present study we investigated water use strategies of mature stands of fagus sylvatica with and without co cultivation of abies alba during a simulated summer drought and subsequent simulated heavy precipitation in a temperate forest in south west germany to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate root water uptake in a mature temperate forest ecosystem subjected to drying wetting cycles we showed that both species used water from deep soil layers during drought experiment 1 though for beeches the contribution of deep soil layers to water supply was not able to support the transpiration demand the transpiration of firs remained unaffected by drought probably due to a mixture of an isohydric water use strategy and the taproot system the reactions towards high intensity irrigation differed among species but also between beeches of the pure and mixed stands indicating competition between beech trees and firs in the mixed stand experiment 2 4 1 including restrictions into the slm model increases its physiological relevance the incorporation of a travel time lag for water transport within the tree resulted in different soil water input depth for the slm model used to calculate rwu depths berry et al 2018 sprenger et al 2019 consequently the rwu revealed different results of water uptake from the soil commonly slm models are applied using programs such as mixsir moore and semmens 2008 siar parnell et al 2010 and simmr parnell 2016 these models even though providing consistent statistical grounds lack mechanistic insight and do not reflect underlying processes affecting source contributions ogle et al 2014 2004 hence we a priori filtered data based on the treeś sap velocity thereby introducing a tree specific time lag which resulted in more delayed response for firs compared to beeches in accordance with generally higher transport rates and thus turnover times in deciduous trees than in conifers meinzer et al 2005 in a study of meinzer et al 2006 the authors fed d2o directly into the transpiration stream and calculated tracer velocities from the arrival of tracer at the transpiration site when compared to sap velocities the authors found that sap velocities severely underestimated the transport velocity in our study we related the tracer peak in the xylem sap to the highest tracer concentration in the soil when accounting for the calculated water travel time using sap velocities in beeches and firs of the mixed stand we argue that the mean sap velocity depicts the mean time it takes for most of a precipitate to get transported through the sapwood and reach the transpiration site thus it provides valuable information when predicting water travel times through forested ecosystems nevertheless we are aware that the sap velocity integrates over different vessel tracheid diameters and wood densities early vs latewood so that tracer water can be transported via preferential flow and partially reach transpiration sites earlier meinzer et al 2006 in order to identify potential water sources correctly we additionally restricted soil water uptake by roots when ψm ψplantmax i e changing the prior information for the model input lobet et al 2014 rothfuss and javaux 2017 this approach was chosen to adapt the model input data for the feasible range trees can extract water from the soil it restricted shallow soil layers down to 0 5 m from contributing to transpiration during the drought treatment and at the beginning of the irrigation experiment thereby enlarging the contributions of deep roots when shallow soil water availability is low ellsworth and sternberg 2015 as has been previously observed for beech trees by brinkmann et al 2018 and allen et al 2019 but not for firs 4 2 beech trees and firs use water from deeper soil layers during drought soil water uptake depths are linked to rooting patterns and active root areas ogle et al 2004 beech trees are reported to have most of their root biomass in the uppermost 30 cm of the soil and generally root down to 1 m schmid and kazda 2001 while firs preferably root between 20 and 80 cm soil depth potępa et al 2018 we were able to show that the source water for shallow soil layers and xylem sap is not the same during drought to this end isotopic signatures of shallow soil layers probably reflect precipitation signatures in combination with evaporative fractionation due to rain exclusion isotope signatures of water in xylem sap rather reflect the mixture of water from mostly deep soil layers as supported by modeling rwu depths hence both species were able to take up water from deeper soil layers during drought indicating high plasticity of water uptake patterns the use of water from deeper soil layers has previously been observed for mature beech trees in switzerland allen et al 2019 brinkmann et al 2019 where soil moisture decreased in the uppermost soil layers and beech was able to switch water uptake to deeper soil layers generally it is a well established pattern in arid semiarid regions or regions subjected to seasonal droughts bréda et al 1995 dawson and pate 1996 eggemeyer et al 2008 garnier et al 1986 markewitz et al 2010 to gradually shift water uptake downward when the upper soil dries out under these conditions roots growing deeper into the soil ensure overnight recovery of the treeś water potential equilibrium bréda et al 1995 thereby supporting tree transpiration in times of low swc and high vpd however even though beech trees were able to switch their water uptake to deeper soil layers drought severely reduced their sap flow rates indicating that water uptake from deep soil layers was not able to support their transpiration demand brinkmann et al 2016 magh et al 2019 firs on the other hand were affected marginally by drought as their transpiration rates remained fairly constant we account this to i the taproot system of firs indicating a higher plasticity in water uptake depth of firs compared to beech trees and ii the more isohydric strategy of firs to safe water during times of low soil moisture bréda et al 2006 camarero et al 2015 4 3 beeches transpire water from shallow soil layers faster than firs upon irrigation beeches in the pure stand recovered transpiration to the rates of the control group supporting the observation that transpiration will be reduced under stress conditions e g hanson todd and amthor 2001 and that the recovery of water use by beeches subjected to drought can be complete kunz et al 2016 sánchez gómez et al 2013 tognetti et al 1995 kunz et al 2016 studied responses of beech seedlings to drought and subsequent rewetting and found rates of stomatal conductance and photosynthesis to recover fully within three days another study found full recovery in beech seedlings only after 48 days sánchez gómez et al 2013 in a study with mature beech trees dietrich and kahmen 2019 found that even small drought intermitting rainfall events were able to increase sap flow rates indicating that recovery from drought can be instantaneous our data suggest that 11 days are required for full recovery of sap flow rates at the field site studied as indicated by the tracer peak in the xylem sap water additionally a constant fine root turnover strategy in beech trees as observed by mainiero and kazda 2006 supports the faster response of water transport by beech trees to precipitation after drought unaffected sap flow rates of firs in response to the irrigation could be attributed to the aforementioned isohydric water use strategy in combination with a sufficient water supply by the taproot system lower hydraulic conductivity of the xylem tissues of firs is a likely explanation for the delayed observation of tracer water in the xylem sap dietrich and kahmen 2019 meidner and sheriff 1976 a delayed response of deeper rooted species toward precipitation after drought has also previously been reported by volkmann et al 2016 in investigations with oak seedlings the authors attributed this finding to an inactivation of the topsoil fine root system a strategy previously reported for juniperus and pinus eggemeyer et al 2008 and three evergreen conifers yang et al 2015 here lower hydraulic conductivity of the xylem tissue is conceivable to explain the delayed response to the irrigation after drought the advantages of this process are associated with wider hydraulic safety margins making conifers generally less prone to drought induced cavitation but come at the cost of carbon gain carnicer et al 2013 choat et al 2012 4 4 water in mixed beech fir stands is subject to competition water transport of beech trees in the mixed stands was apparently not able to recover from drought as sap flow rates remained reduced by half after the irrigation until the end of our experiment while beech trees in the pure stand once water uptake from the topsoil was re established used around 70 of water from more shallow soil depths beech trees in the mixed stand obtained only 50 whereas firs used around 70 of the water in shallow soil layers also we found beeches in the mixed stands revealing significantly lower ψplant than those in the mixed stand these observation and the inability of beeches in the mixed stand to recover sap flow rates upon irrigation after drought to levels of the control is surprising since beech is considered to be a very competitive species above longuetaud et al 2013 and belowground rewald and leuschner 2009 at high and low productivity sites toïgo et al 2015 it seems though that drought can constrain this competitiveness of beech trees in mixed stands with fir so that beeches were not able to recover when water supply was restored these observations indicate higher interspecific competition within the mixed stand than the aforementioned intraspecific competition of beech in the pure stand since stand densities were similar between the pure and mixed stand and can therefore be excluded as a potential cause of water relief in the pure stand one possible explanation for this competition situation could be the aforementioned wider hydraulic safety margin of the conifer avoiding the drought stress and therefore avoiding drought induced cavitation carnicer et al 2013 choat et al 2012 while beeches as angiosperms are found to be more susceptible towards drought induced cavitation brodribb et al 2012 which in turn reduces their hydraulic conductivity explaining the inability to regain high transpiration rates in the mixed stands in the pure beech stand the thicker litter layer might have prevented soil moisture from crossing a critical threshold explaining why beeches here did regain high rates of transpiration this indication of competition of beech and fir for water resources seems to contradict previous findings suggesting facilitative effects of fir on beech magh et al 2018a however the study of magh et al 2018 was conducted in a year without drought using an approach that integrated water relations during leaf lifetime thus drought might be able to turn long term facilitative effects of fir on beech into competition when water supply gets limited 5 conclusion during times of drought both beech and fir trees reveal high water use plasticity shifting their water uptake depth toward deeper and moister soil layers while this shift is sufficient to support firs transpiration demand the water demand is still not met in beech trees either in mixed or pure stands underlining its drought sensitivity betsch et al 2011 leuschner et al 2001 leuzinger et al 2005 once water supply had been restored beeches in monospecific stands were able to recover both water uptake from shallow soil layers and sap flow rates while in the mixed stand beeches competed unsuccessfully with fir for water as indicated by still reduced sap flow rates and inconsistent rwu patterns thus the facilitative effect of silver fir on water relations of beech trees as has been proposed in earlier studies magh et al 2018a rehschuh et al 2019 was likely disrupted by drought and turned into competition for water resources projecting this finding into a climate change exposed future suggests a very careful consideration

5418,the continuous warming observed in recent decades as a result of climate change is posing significant threats to the environment particularly for freshwater ecosystems therefore it is highly important to predict the impact of this phenomenon on habitat suitability however such prediction requires the use of an integrated framework in which different parameters can be incorporated while 1d modelling has been commonly used in river habit suitability simulations most 1d mathematical models either do not provide enough information for the area along the rivers or do not consider the impact of river basin management on the river flow characteristics this study seeks to develop such an integrated framework is in which water temperature and hydrologic hydraulic parameters are jointly applied to simulate habitat suitability the modeling setup is based on a combination of the soil and water assessment tool swat and international river interface cooperative iric models and due to the importance of the water temperature the water temperature module in swat was modified to examine the effectiveness of this method kikuchi basin is selected as the case study and two different general circulation models namely hadgem2 es and micro5 under two representative concentration pathways are applied to evaluate river habitat suitability under climate change conditions the results showed a reduction in the river flows water depths and velocities that have slightly positive effects on the habitat suitability of the kikuchi river however this reduction causes some parts of the river to become dry so that some of the habitats may disappear as a result of climate change moreover it is shown that the downstream section of the kikuchi river is more vulnerable to climate change therefore migration of fishes to its upstream section is predicted finally the proposed methodology is strongly recommended for use in modeling of other regions suffering water scarcity keywords swat nays2dh solver evatrip solver iric software habitat suitability water temperature kikuchi river 1 introduction climate change has substantial effects on river systems and consequently on their habitat suitability for aquatic fauna inoue and berg 2017 lin et al 2015 shen et al 2018 yu et al 2018 investigation of such effects are crucial for 1 predicting the future habitat suitability of aquatic species spurgeon et al 2019 2 the successful restoration of the physical diversity and biodiversity to maintain ecological flows li et al 2015 and 3 implementation of relevant strategies for adaption steen et al 2010 to simulate habitat suitability it is important to consider different indicators and habitat characteristics however many of these are affected by the changes in the hydrological and hydraulic properties of streamflows woodward et al 2010 that are characterized by a large number of parameters the simulation of such diverse indicators requires the use of integrated models the soil and water assessment tool swat model is a very well known open source model that has been frequently applied in climate change studies rezaei zaman et al 2016 lee et al 2017 chatterjee et al 2018 swat has also been applied in conjunction with different environmental models such as the iha indicators of hydrologic alteration model abouabdillah et al 2010 mittal et al 2016 morid et al 2016 kiesel et al 2019 to investigate the impact of climate change on habitat suitability the water temperature is another important environmental factor that impacts biota because of its effect on the nutrient cycling in riverine systems pletterbauer et al 2018 therefore this variable must also be considerd in the assessment of the impact of climate change on the habitat suitability swat can also be used to perform water temperature modeling although currently such modeling is based on the air temperature only and needs to be improved for this purpose ficklin et al 2012 modified the default water temperature equation in swat by adding more elements such as surface runoff snowmelt and groundwater inflow volume and temperature a similar approach was implemented by vancompernolle et al 2019 to investigate whether for a species living in a habitat with the particular hydrologic and water temperature conditions within a watershed these conditions can be considered to be predictive of the species geographic presence in addition to the hydrological characteristics the distribution of the habitat types is expected to be affected by the hydraulic conditions and morphology of the river kiesel et al 2019 over the last three decades researchers have investigated the cause and effect relationships between the natural and human made changes and the stream health and habitat suitability in riverine ecosystems the international river interface cooperative iric is a software package used to simulate habitat suitability considering the changes in the hydraulic parameters of rivers radinger et al 2017 and has a range of relevant capabilities including 17 solvers shimizu and nelson 2007 nones 2019 applied iric using the diversity habitat simulation dhabsim solver to simulate the hydrodynamics of the river po in italy to evaluate its habitat conditions considering climate change and anthropogenic pressure the results showed that an extreme and long lasting reduction of the flow discharge that threatens the overall biological status of the river is expected among the different solvers implemented in the iric software the evaluation tools for river environmental planning evatrip is a unique solver that evaluates the necessity of protecting the riverbank and fish habitat this solver is mostly based on the phabsim method for the evaluation of the habitat suitability index hsi oishi et al 2016 then after determining the composite suitability index the amount of the weighted usable area wua can be calculated here each cell area should be multiplied by the respective composite suitability factor ahmadi nedushan et al 2006 wua reflects the surface area in square meters that can potentially be used in each step in the life cycle of a fish species regina et al 2016 building on the previous works this study seeks to develop an integrated basin river framework for the hydrological and hydraulic analyses of habitat suitability for this purpose a hybrid approach consisting of swat models coupled with iric as a 2d flow model is used the swat model simulations are performed in two phases and include land and water i e the catchment area and its channel networks therefore the simulations can obtain most of the necessary information regarding the discharge features with respect to the changes resulting from human activities or climate change however the model uses a one dimensional 1d mathematical model for river routing and does not provide enough information along the rivers e g mapping inundation extent rai et al 2018 to address this limitation the model is linked to iric a 2d river flow model in addition to its integration of several parameters the most important features of this hybrid system for evaluation of habitat suitability are 1 simulation of a variety of hydrological and hydraulic indicators and their interactions 2 addition of new modules or modification of the existing modules for more accurate simulations of the important processes such as water temperature that need to be considered under climate change condition to examine the developed method and the suggested modeling system kikuchi basin is selected as the case study in this work 2 method and materials 2 1 study area the kikuchi river fig 1 flows through the northern part of the kumamoto prefecture in kyushu island japan the basin extends from 130 0 20 131 0 49 e longitude to 32 51 44 33 10 8 n latitude and has an area of 995 km2 ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2011 the average annual precipitation in the case study is approximately 2300 mm and the average temperature is 15 c japan meteorological agency 2016 the river has been the base for many human activities as well as 34 fish species ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2011 the basin contains several important national parks and rich ecology the river forms the foundation of the region s social economic and cultural resources ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2011 morid et al 2019 showed how the basin s climate variables and runoff are expected to vary under climate change conditions they reported more extreme hydrological events including more frequent extreme low flows and high flow pulses therefore the impacts of these changes on the habitat suitability of the kikuchi river have to be investigated in more detail to assess such impacts it is important to choose a proper target aquatic fauna species generally the target species is dominant endangered protected or commercially valuable and should be able to reflect the current and future status of the river s ecosystem im et al 2018 in this study zacco platypus and zacco temminckii which are dominant species in the kikuchi river were chosen as the target fish species they were also considered in different environmental assessment studies that considered the habitat suitability ynagawa et al 2007 kwon et al 2015 choi and choi 2018 nakagawa 2019 2 2 data within and around the study area there are eight meteorological stations that measure meteorological parameters including air temperature and rainfall japan meteorological agency 2016 and five hydrological stations that measure the discharge of the kikuchi river ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2016 all of these meteorological stations have historical data collected over 31 years from 1986 to 2016 except the masuki station which has 14 years of observed data the hydrological stations also have 30 years of observed historical data except the tamana station 1986 2012 and yamaga station 1990 2015 there are also seven water temperature stations with less than two years of data 6 2015 8 2016 whose data were used to calibrate and validate the modified water temperature formula in the swat model fig 1 shows all stations that were used in this study 2 3 reagent fauna as previously mentioned two fish spices were selected for this study as the representative suitability index of the kikuchi river zacco platypus from the family of the pale chub is a fish species native of the japanese rivers and streams well known as oikawa in japan this kind of fish can grow at temperatures of up to 20 c however they usually grow at temperatures of up to 13 c its diet consists of zooplankton and adults tend to live in rivers that have a rapid flow and avoid stagnant and deep waters they prefer to live at the bottom of rivers which is where their food source is located their spawning period is from may to august when they put eggs with a diameter of 30 50 cm at the bottom of the gravel after 4 days larvae whose length is about 7 2 mm but if they can be alive more and not to be hunted their length would reach 14 mm in this time they prefer living in a water depth of 5 15 cm with slow water flow and be on the surface near the banks at the juvenile stage they have a strong tendency to go upstream where water depth is about 1 m kawabe et al 1989 zacco temminckii kawamustu is a subfamily of the oikawa and has a length of 15 cm they live in the upstream and middle stream sections where the water velocity is low the spawning season is may to august when they gather in a shallow area and lay eggs and cover them with sand and gravel at the bottom of the river kawabe et al 1989 2 4 modeling setup the modeling setup of this study and its integrated framework are shown in fig 2 the first stage involves obtaining the general circulation model gcm data and pre processing in the next step the swat model is calibrated to simulate watershed hydrology for the baseline and future periods then the impact of hydrological changes along with water temperature on the river s hydraulic parameters as well as its habitat suitability on the target fish is evaluated using the iric model the next sections provide more details about the framework 2 4 1 general circulation model the gcm models data are published by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc among the many gcms introduced in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 the hadgem2 es and micro5 data are used here to predict future meteorological data there are four different representative concentration pathways rcp namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 and rcp8 5 hadgem2 es is one of the cmip5 s models published by the met office hadley centre and the micro5 was developed by the japan agency for marine earth science and technology atmosphere and ocean research institute lawrence livermore national security 2018 these two models are selected owing to their relatively high resolution less than 1 8 in longitude and latitude moreover they are well established models for the prediction of future climates in asia and japan kudo et al 2017 nukazawa et al 2018 the baseline period for this study was1986 2016 and 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 are the future climate evaluation periods to downscale the gcms we applied the long ashton research station weather generator lars wg method which is a popular statistical downscaling model to simulate weather data at a single site under current and future climate conditions based on the spell length approach hashmi et al 2011 hassan et al 2014 furthermore it s suitability for the simulation of extreme events and daily values across diverse climate conditions has been proven iizumi et al 2012 the climate variables used by the lars wg are the daily precipitations in millimeter maximum and minimum temperature in celsius and solar radiation hassan et al 2014 which were applied to calibrate and validate the model after calibration the modified data were used for generating realistic climate data stochastically corresponding to the present and future climate scenario dibike and coulibaly 2005 2 4 2 hydrological model swat is a process based continuous hydrological model which divides each sub basin into smaller hydrological response units hrus i e it is a semi distributed model neitsch et al 2002 the main components of the model which are also required for this study include climate hydrology water temperature land management and channel routine neitsch et al 2011 the calibration of the model is crucial for this the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 algorithm was used via the swat cup software furthermore the gcm downscaled data were used as input for the model to simulate future streamflows 2 4 3 water temperature climate change causes the increase in the water temperature of rivers kędra and wiejaczka 2018 therefore it might affect the population and distribution of species in aquatic environments inoue and berg 2017 the swat simulates the water temperature using the following equation neitsch et al 2011 1 t water 5 0 0 75 t air where twater and t air are the average daily water and air temperatures c respectively however given the importance of this variable and its impact on habitat suitability we modified the swat source code and added the methodology proposed by ficklin et al 2012 this considers the impacts of air temperature snowmelt surface runoff and groundwater on water temperature through the following steps 1 local water temperature the temperature and local water contribution within the sub basin are estimated considering the volumes and temperatures of snowmelt surface groundwater and lateral inflow volumes to the stream reach within the local basin 2 initial stream temperature the temperature and inflow volume from the upstream sub basins are estimated the stream temperature before the effects of air temperature is calculated as a weighted average of the contributions within the sub basin and from the upstream sub basins 3 final stream temperature the heat transfer at the air water interface during the streamflow travel time in the sub basin is calculated therefore the final stream temperature is simulated by adding a change to the initial stream temperature in the sub basin fig 3 shows these steps and more detail on the water temperature modification in swat which is also available in ficklin et al 2012 2 4 4 iric in this study two solvers of the iric software were used to calculate the hsi for the two target fish species this software has a good resolution for tracking any change in the riverbed in other words this model creates a virtual grid on the river to simplify the evaluation of the river condition the output of the nays2dh solver which includes the water velocity and depth in the iric software was used as the input of the evatrip solver this solver takes two main steps to evaluate habitat suitability in each cell of the river grid first it calculates the physical index of discharge depth and river channel coefficients next it evaluates a fitness index si with a value between 0 and 1 based on the distribution condition or the observed data indicating the degree of selection of the physical index fig 5 oishi et al 2016 it is worth noting that the sis of the river characteristics water velocity and water depth were achieved from the iric sample data for oikawa and kawamatsu fish moreover the results of the study of choi and choi 2018 on water temperature si were used to calculate the hsi for our target fish as follows 2 hsi s i v s i d s i tw where each si represents the suitability index of habitat variables including velocity depth and flow temperature the interpolation method is also as follows fig 4 oishi et al 2016 if h k h i j h k 1 t h e n s i i j s i k s i k 1 s i k h k 1 h k h i j h k where k is the number of a certain point in the data and h k is value of hydraulic variable such as water depth and si k is suitability index for the point of k using a linear interpolation it is possible to have hsi for each cells of river grid after determining the hsi via the evatrip the wua was obtained by summing all products of the area of each mesh cell and their hsi values in the gis environment 3 wua n i hsi i a i here hsii and ai are the hsi value and surface area of the cell i respectively this parameter was computed within reach at a specific discharge as follows fig 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 generation of future climate scenarios assessing the impact of climate change on the meteorological parameters in the kikuchi basin was our first step to evaluate habitat suitability the results of the gcms show that the basin s mean annual precipitation reduces to 2100 mm for the first future period 2021 2040 under the two gcms while it is approximately 2300 mm in the baseline period 1986 2016 fig 6 however the results are different for the two following periods under hadgem2 es the annual rainfall is expected to increase by 70 and 50 mm in 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 respectively however decreases of approximately 200 and 50 mm are predicted in 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 respectively by the micro5 as shown in fig 7 the general variation of monthly rainfall patterns is the same except in september and october such uncertainties in gcms for kyushu island were also reported by kudo et al 2017 both models predicted that the basin s average annual air temperature will increase from approximately 15 c in the baseline period to 18 4 c rcp4 5 and 19 7 c rcp8 5 under hadgem2 es and micro5 respectively more details about the impacts of climate change on the kikuchi basin are available in morid et al 2019 3 2 hydrological simulations the model was calibrated using data from 1986 to 2010 and was validated by comparing the simulated and measured streamflow data from 2011 to 2015 fig 8 the swat model uses many parameters to simulate river discharge so the most sensitive parameters were selected based on the results of a sensitivity analysis the calibration parameters for the hydrological simulation and some of their best values following calibration are shown in table 1 three indicators including the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency and the percent bias pbias were analyzed to test the validity of the calibration ns 0 5 and r2 0 5 were considered acceptable for the streamflow simulation pbias 10 and 10 pbias 15 indicated as a very good and good performance of the model respectively moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 using the calibrated swat and the future climate data which were based on micro5 and hadgem2 es respectively under two rcps a reduction in the stream flow in the kikuchi basin from 46 m3 s in the baseline period 1986 2016 to approximately 40 m3 s under micro5 was predicted this reduction was also predicted by hadgem2 es from 2021 to 2040 however for the two future periods from 2041 to 2060 and from 2061 to 2080 the streamflow is expected to increase by 2 and 1 m3 s respectively table 2 this disagreement between the two models is due to the uncertainties in the gcms for japan the flow duration curve fdc which represents the percentages of time flow in the river q10 q20 q30 etc was obtained fig 9 to perform a more accurate estimation of future changes in extreme events the flow corresponding to q90 should be the minimum flow available for drinking water or irrigation projects the average flow i e 50 of time flow at the kikuchi river outlet is 14 m3 s which is predicted to be the same in the future the low flow corresponding to q90 which represents the base flow is 3 m3 s and is predicted to decrease by 1 m3 s by 2080 the maximum discharge observed was 113 m3 s which will increase to 130 m3 s according to hadgem2 es rcp4 5 and decrease by up to 100 m3 s according to miicro5 rcp 8 5 this information is useful to estimate the design flood which is predicted to increase under both gcms 3 3 impact of climate change on water temperature as previously stated a new module for water temperature section 1 4 3 was included in the swat model for this study then it was calibrated for each of the seven stations located in different sub basins fig 1 because the recorded time series was short the calibration period was set from july 21 2015 to june 20 2016 and the validation period was set from august 1 2016 to september 24 2016 table 3 shows different results of the water temperature simulations before and after the swat model formula modification in general when ns 0 5 and r2 0 5 pbias 10 and the root mean square error rmse is below 3 c which are acceptable as can be seen in the table before the formula modification in most of the stations the rmse is higher than 3 c and r2 is less than 0 4 however after modification the results of calibration and validation are almost satisfactory because most of the station s coefficients are in the acceptable range except for ki1 and ku4 fig 10 shows the impact of climate change on water temperatures as can be seen from the fig the water temperature is predicted to increase by up to 5 c at both the upstream y8 station and the downstream id 3 station as the suitable water temperature for our target fish is 10 22 c froese and pauly 2019 it is assumed that this rise in the water temperature upstream will not have a significant effect on habitat suitability of the target fish however it will influence future habitat conditions downstream in other words the maximum water temperature upstream will be 17 c in july in the baseline period 1986 2016 and is expected to rise to approximately 20 c in the future which is in the range suitable for the target fish in contrast the maximum water temperature downstream will be 27 c in the baseline period and is predicted to increase to up to 30 c by 2080 july is the most critical month for both oikawa and kawamutsu fish in terms of spawning and such water temperature increases will have a negative impact on their lives 3 4 impact of climate change on hydraulic parameters one of the objectives of this study is to analyze the impact of climate change on the future hydraulic parameters in the kikuchi river as shown in table 2 the highest and lowest levels of river flow are predicted by the hadgem2 es rcp4 5 and micro5 rcp8 5 in 2041 2060 respectively by using the outputs of the swat model from these two gcms the nays2dh solver in the iric software was run for three months august january and july moreover to evaluate the changes in hydraulic parameters more accurately the river was classified into three different habitat types namely pool deep water with a smooth water surface run fast water usually deeper than a riffle and riffle fast water with a shallow water surface based on jowett s methodology jowett and richardson 1989 the results showed that despite the decreasing water depth and velocity between january and july the hydraulic parameters would increase in august by 2060 fig 11 more and stronger floods are predicted which will have various effects on the ecosystem as well as the aquatic habitat suitability 3 5 habitat suitability analyzes in terms of water temperature and hydraulic parameters the previous results showed the impacts of climate change on the streamflows of the kikuchi river the highest reduction and rise were predicted by micro5 under rcp8 5 from 46 to 41 m3 s and hadgem2 es under rcp4 5 from 46 to 48 m3 s in 2041 2060 respectively next we analyzed the impact of alterations in the characteristics of river flows e g average and min max flows velocity depth on habitat suitability these evaluations were performed for august january and july because the maximum and minimum flows occur in august and january respectively the most important month for spawning is july katano et al 2000 ynagawa et al 2007 owing to the previously mentioned issues and for brevity we only present the results for the 2041 2060 period and the three critical months 3 5 1 wua for oikawa fish fig 12 shows the wua for oikawa in the selected months obtained using the integrated modeling setup described in fig 2 to show the importance of the water temperature we evaluated the wuas with and without consideration of this variable it can be seen from the fig that the highest wua values correspond to the average discharge of the river in january which is approximately 44 000 and 7000 m2 km for adult and non adult fish respectively however when the discharge of the river is at its minimum value the wua decreases to approximately 4000 and 700 800 m2 km for adult and non adult fish fig 13 also shows the distribution of hsis along the river it can be seen from fig 13 a that the decrease in the hsi in august is mostly due to the increase in water depth and velocity which affect the future wuas interestingly although the wua is expected to decrease in january for both life stages of the adult and non adult at the minimum the river flow fig 12 the hsis in these conditions are expected to increase slightly fig 13 b this is because some parts of the river will lose water decreasing the habitable space of the oikawa fish however in other parts of the river the hsi will increase because the water depth and water velocity will decrease in contrast no significant change in the hsi is observed in july fig 13 c because oikawa fish prefer low water depths and velocities august when the discharge of the river is at its average value is not a suitable month for both adult and non adult fish at the average value of discharge the wua is expected to be approximately the same as in january and july by 2060 this condition is similar for july at the minimum value of discharge on the other hand it is expected to decrease in january at low river flows this reduction is mostly due to the decrease in the area having water this means that in the future there will be some dry areas that used to have water therefore although the hsi will increase the wua will decrease for oikawa fish in this study we also assessed the wua considering the water temperature to evaluate the extent to which this parameter can affect the hsi the results for oikawa fish showed that except january which has the minimum value of discharge the wua does not change significantly when the water temperature is not considered however the evaluation performed considering the water temperature shows that this parameter has a significant effect on the habitat suitability the decrease in the habitat suitability is visible in august and july from fig 14 interestingly while when only the hydraulic parameters were considered for the wua evaluation the habitat suitability was predicted to decrease in january the habitat suitability was expected to increase in this month when the water temperature was considered 3 5 2 wua for kawamutsu fish as can be seen from fig 15 the highest and lowest values of wua for kawamutsu fish are in january for non adult fish approximately 30000 m2 km and adult fish approximately 100 m2 km respectively generally wua is expected to decrease with the age of the fish except in august when the discharge of the river is at its minimum the habitat suitability of non adult kawamutsu fish will increase in january when the average value of discharge is observed from 32 000 to 35600 m2 km however the wua is predicted to decrease with the age of the fish because low water depths and velocities become unsuitable generally the kikuchi river does not have high habitat suitability for adult kawamutsu fish in august fig 16 a while it is better for non adult fish even at the minimum discharge value approximately 3000 m2 km which is expected to decrease by 600 m2 km by 2060 the minimum value of wua is in january at the lowest level of discharge which is expected to reduce from 143 m2 km in the baseline period to 85 m2 km in 2060 fig 16 b the wua is not appropriate for adult kawamutsu in july fig 16 c and is expected to increase slightly from 305 m2 km in the baseline period to approximately 320 m2 km in the average discharge period by 2060 nevertheless the wua for non adult fish is appropriate and it is expected to be the same in the future habitat suitability condition for kawamutsu fish is not the same for adult and juvenile fish it is expected to be lower and higher in january at the average value of discharge for adult and non adult fish this is because non adult fish prefer high water depths and velocities which are not suitable for adult fish in august the wua is expected to decrease and in january hsi will increase at the minimum value of discharge by 2060 the conditions in july are not suitable for adult kawamutsu fish but they are suitable for non adult fish at the minimum value of river flow which is expected to increase slightly in the future the results related to kawamutsu fish showed that except in august in the minimum value of discharge the wua has no notable changes however as shown in fig 17 the reduction in habitat suitability in august and july is evident interestingly habitat suitability was predicted to decrease in january for adult fish when only hydraulic parameters were used in wua calculations however when considering the water temperature habitat suitability was predicted to increase in this month moreover when the water temperature was not considered the wua was predicted not to have significant changes in july while it was predicted to decrease significantly when considering the water temperature 3 5 3 wua in flood periods moreover our research showed that the water temperature has more significant effects than floods as can be seen in fig 18 the wua does not change in the flood period for both target fish when the water temperature is not considered however it decreases when the water temperature is considered it is worth noting that the water temperature is predicted to increase by up to 5 c by 2080 which can pose a threat to both target fish especially in july which is spawning time the zacco platypus s climate zone is 10 22 c froese and pauly 2019 and our result show that the water temperature will reach 30 c by 2080 the highest water temperature rise of up to 6 c occurs from november to february this increase has significant effects on both target species the hsi increases by up to 80 in january and decreases by up to 70 in july tables 4 and 5 4 conclusion the aim of this research was to develop an integrated framework for the modeling of habitat suitability for this purpose a hybrid system was applied by linking the swat and iric models additionally due to the importance of the water temperature the relevant module of swat was modified for obtain more accurate results a shortcoming of this work is the absence of a validation procedure for the interpolation method due to lack of observed information about target fish but in any case our outcomes provide useful insights on riverine ecosystem management the most important features of the system that should be considered for better policy and decisions making in environment management are as follows impact of human activities in the basins or along the rivers on the river habitat suitability simulation of the basins under different climate scenarios and their consequences for the river habitat suitability linkage of hydrological and hydraulic indicators and their interaction for better spatial and temporal evaluations of the river habitat suitability possibility of introducing new indices for the study area and research objectives this system was applied to the kikuchi river basin under climate change conditions additionally the his index that considers the river velocity depth and water temperature was applied accordingly the region s future temperature and precipitation were predicted using two different gcms namely the hadgem2 es and micro5 under two rcps the following conclusions can be drawn for this basin 1 the application of the gcms data showed relatively high uncertainties for the future precipitation in the kyushu basin both gcms predicted that the precipitation will decrease in the period from 2021 to 2040 however the gcms made different predictions for the precipitation in 2041 2060 and 2061 280 high uncertainties in the gcms predictions for japan were also reported by kudo et al 2017 2 the innovative integrated modeling setup that linked swat and iric to simulate the hydrological and hydraulic parameters and water temperatures using the method proposed by ficklin et al 2012 successfully described the spatial variation in the hsi along the kikuchi river and the wuas in the considered sub basins thus this framework can be recommended for application to other cases 3 the introduction of the water temperature evaluation was very important in this setup in the region considered in this study using the measured data obtained at seven gauging stations it was shown that using the default water temperature formula of the swat the rmse was approximately between 4 and 13 c among the stations while the rmse was between approximately 2 and 3 c when the modified formula was used 4 it was shown that climate change can alter the river flows e g changes between 6 and 2 m3 s in the annual average when using the selected gcms the river flow reduction has both advantages and disadvantages for river habitat suitability the advantage is that both of the target fish prefer low water depth velocity therefore for instance during january while the river has a low water level the hsi will slightly increase however this water depth reduction causes some parts of the river to become dry and consequently some of the habitats may disappear 5 the results showed that the water temperature affects the habitat suitability of the target fish more than the hydraulic parameters when the habitat suitability was analyzed based on the hydraulic parameters only wua decreased by up to 5 and 40 for oikawa and kawamutsu respectively by contrast when the water temperature was considered wua decreased by up to 70 for both target fish 6 it was also shown that the downstream part of the kikuchi river is more vulnerable to climate change and its water temperature can increase to 30 c in july by contrast in the upstream part the water temperature increases to approximately 20 c which is still suitable for our target fish 7 the results raise serious concerns and imply the need for the early implementation of adaptation strategies to save the river ecosystem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement we are grateful for the support of the fund for the river ecology research

5418,the continuous warming observed in recent decades as a result of climate change is posing significant threats to the environment particularly for freshwater ecosystems therefore it is highly important to predict the impact of this phenomenon on habitat suitability however such prediction requires the use of an integrated framework in which different parameters can be incorporated while 1d modelling has been commonly used in river habit suitability simulations most 1d mathematical models either do not provide enough information for the area along the rivers or do not consider the impact of river basin management on the river flow characteristics this study seeks to develop such an integrated framework is in which water temperature and hydrologic hydraulic parameters are jointly applied to simulate habitat suitability the modeling setup is based on a combination of the soil and water assessment tool swat and international river interface cooperative iric models and due to the importance of the water temperature the water temperature module in swat was modified to examine the effectiveness of this method kikuchi basin is selected as the case study and two different general circulation models namely hadgem2 es and micro5 under two representative concentration pathways are applied to evaluate river habitat suitability under climate change conditions the results showed a reduction in the river flows water depths and velocities that have slightly positive effects on the habitat suitability of the kikuchi river however this reduction causes some parts of the river to become dry so that some of the habitats may disappear as a result of climate change moreover it is shown that the downstream section of the kikuchi river is more vulnerable to climate change therefore migration of fishes to its upstream section is predicted finally the proposed methodology is strongly recommended for use in modeling of other regions suffering water scarcity keywords swat nays2dh solver evatrip solver iric software habitat suitability water temperature kikuchi river 1 introduction climate change has substantial effects on river systems and consequently on their habitat suitability for aquatic fauna inoue and berg 2017 lin et al 2015 shen et al 2018 yu et al 2018 investigation of such effects are crucial for 1 predicting the future habitat suitability of aquatic species spurgeon et al 2019 2 the successful restoration of the physical diversity and biodiversity to maintain ecological flows li et al 2015 and 3 implementation of relevant strategies for adaption steen et al 2010 to simulate habitat suitability it is important to consider different indicators and habitat characteristics however many of these are affected by the changes in the hydrological and hydraulic properties of streamflows woodward et al 2010 that are characterized by a large number of parameters the simulation of such diverse indicators requires the use of integrated models the soil and water assessment tool swat model is a very well known open source model that has been frequently applied in climate change studies rezaei zaman et al 2016 lee et al 2017 chatterjee et al 2018 swat has also been applied in conjunction with different environmental models such as the iha indicators of hydrologic alteration model abouabdillah et al 2010 mittal et al 2016 morid et al 2016 kiesel et al 2019 to investigate the impact of climate change on habitat suitability the water temperature is another important environmental factor that impacts biota because of its effect on the nutrient cycling in riverine systems pletterbauer et al 2018 therefore this variable must also be considerd in the assessment of the impact of climate change on the habitat suitability swat can also be used to perform water temperature modeling although currently such modeling is based on the air temperature only and needs to be improved for this purpose ficklin et al 2012 modified the default water temperature equation in swat by adding more elements such as surface runoff snowmelt and groundwater inflow volume and temperature a similar approach was implemented by vancompernolle et al 2019 to investigate whether for a species living in a habitat with the particular hydrologic and water temperature conditions within a watershed these conditions can be considered to be predictive of the species geographic presence in addition to the hydrological characteristics the distribution of the habitat types is expected to be affected by the hydraulic conditions and morphology of the river kiesel et al 2019 over the last three decades researchers have investigated the cause and effect relationships between the natural and human made changes and the stream health and habitat suitability in riverine ecosystems the international river interface cooperative iric is a software package used to simulate habitat suitability considering the changes in the hydraulic parameters of rivers radinger et al 2017 and has a range of relevant capabilities including 17 solvers shimizu and nelson 2007 nones 2019 applied iric using the diversity habitat simulation dhabsim solver to simulate the hydrodynamics of the river po in italy to evaluate its habitat conditions considering climate change and anthropogenic pressure the results showed that an extreme and long lasting reduction of the flow discharge that threatens the overall biological status of the river is expected among the different solvers implemented in the iric software the evaluation tools for river environmental planning evatrip is a unique solver that evaluates the necessity of protecting the riverbank and fish habitat this solver is mostly based on the phabsim method for the evaluation of the habitat suitability index hsi oishi et al 2016 then after determining the composite suitability index the amount of the weighted usable area wua can be calculated here each cell area should be multiplied by the respective composite suitability factor ahmadi nedushan et al 2006 wua reflects the surface area in square meters that can potentially be used in each step in the life cycle of a fish species regina et al 2016 building on the previous works this study seeks to develop an integrated basin river framework for the hydrological and hydraulic analyses of habitat suitability for this purpose a hybrid approach consisting of swat models coupled with iric as a 2d flow model is used the swat model simulations are performed in two phases and include land and water i e the catchment area and its channel networks therefore the simulations can obtain most of the necessary information regarding the discharge features with respect to the changes resulting from human activities or climate change however the model uses a one dimensional 1d mathematical model for river routing and does not provide enough information along the rivers e g mapping inundation extent rai et al 2018 to address this limitation the model is linked to iric a 2d river flow model in addition to its integration of several parameters the most important features of this hybrid system for evaluation of habitat suitability are 1 simulation of a variety of hydrological and hydraulic indicators and their interactions 2 addition of new modules or modification of the existing modules for more accurate simulations of the important processes such as water temperature that need to be considered under climate change condition to examine the developed method and the suggested modeling system kikuchi basin is selected as the case study in this work 2 method and materials 2 1 study area the kikuchi river fig 1 flows through the northern part of the kumamoto prefecture in kyushu island japan the basin extends from 130 0 20 131 0 49 e longitude to 32 51 44 33 10 8 n latitude and has an area of 995 km2 ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2011 the average annual precipitation in the case study is approximately 2300 mm and the average temperature is 15 c japan meteorological agency 2016 the river has been the base for many human activities as well as 34 fish species ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2011 the basin contains several important national parks and rich ecology the river forms the foundation of the region s social economic and cultural resources ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2011 morid et al 2019 showed how the basin s climate variables and runoff are expected to vary under climate change conditions they reported more extreme hydrological events including more frequent extreme low flows and high flow pulses therefore the impacts of these changes on the habitat suitability of the kikuchi river have to be investigated in more detail to assess such impacts it is important to choose a proper target aquatic fauna species generally the target species is dominant endangered protected or commercially valuable and should be able to reflect the current and future status of the river s ecosystem im et al 2018 in this study zacco platypus and zacco temminckii which are dominant species in the kikuchi river were chosen as the target fish species they were also considered in different environmental assessment studies that considered the habitat suitability ynagawa et al 2007 kwon et al 2015 choi and choi 2018 nakagawa 2019 2 2 data within and around the study area there are eight meteorological stations that measure meteorological parameters including air temperature and rainfall japan meteorological agency 2016 and five hydrological stations that measure the discharge of the kikuchi river ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2016 all of these meteorological stations have historical data collected over 31 years from 1986 to 2016 except the masuki station which has 14 years of observed data the hydrological stations also have 30 years of observed historical data except the tamana station 1986 2012 and yamaga station 1990 2015 there are also seven water temperature stations with less than two years of data 6 2015 8 2016 whose data were used to calibrate and validate the modified water temperature formula in the swat model fig 1 shows all stations that were used in this study 2 3 reagent fauna as previously mentioned two fish spices were selected for this study as the representative suitability index of the kikuchi river zacco platypus from the family of the pale chub is a fish species native of the japanese rivers and streams well known as oikawa in japan this kind of fish can grow at temperatures of up to 20 c however they usually grow at temperatures of up to 13 c its diet consists of zooplankton and adults tend to live in rivers that have a rapid flow and avoid stagnant and deep waters they prefer to live at the bottom of rivers which is where their food source is located their spawning period is from may to august when they put eggs with a diameter of 30 50 cm at the bottom of the gravel after 4 days larvae whose length is about 7 2 mm but if they can be alive more and not to be hunted their length would reach 14 mm in this time they prefer living in a water depth of 5 15 cm with slow water flow and be on the surface near the banks at the juvenile stage they have a strong tendency to go upstream where water depth is about 1 m kawabe et al 1989 zacco temminckii kawamustu is a subfamily of the oikawa and has a length of 15 cm they live in the upstream and middle stream sections where the water velocity is low the spawning season is may to august when they gather in a shallow area and lay eggs and cover them with sand and gravel at the bottom of the river kawabe et al 1989 2 4 modeling setup the modeling setup of this study and its integrated framework are shown in fig 2 the first stage involves obtaining the general circulation model gcm data and pre processing in the next step the swat model is calibrated to simulate watershed hydrology for the baseline and future periods then the impact of hydrological changes along with water temperature on the river s hydraulic parameters as well as its habitat suitability on the target fish is evaluated using the iric model the next sections provide more details about the framework 2 4 1 general circulation model the gcm models data are published by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc among the many gcms introduced in the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 the hadgem2 es and micro5 data are used here to predict future meteorological data there are four different representative concentration pathways rcp namely rcp2 6 rcp4 5 rcp6 and rcp8 5 hadgem2 es is one of the cmip5 s models published by the met office hadley centre and the micro5 was developed by the japan agency for marine earth science and technology atmosphere and ocean research institute lawrence livermore national security 2018 these two models are selected owing to their relatively high resolution less than 1 8 in longitude and latitude moreover they are well established models for the prediction of future climates in asia and japan kudo et al 2017 nukazawa et al 2018 the baseline period for this study was1986 2016 and 2021 2040 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 are the future climate evaluation periods to downscale the gcms we applied the long ashton research station weather generator lars wg method which is a popular statistical downscaling model to simulate weather data at a single site under current and future climate conditions based on the spell length approach hashmi et al 2011 hassan et al 2014 furthermore it s suitability for the simulation of extreme events and daily values across diverse climate conditions has been proven iizumi et al 2012 the climate variables used by the lars wg are the daily precipitations in millimeter maximum and minimum temperature in celsius and solar radiation hassan et al 2014 which were applied to calibrate and validate the model after calibration the modified data were used for generating realistic climate data stochastically corresponding to the present and future climate scenario dibike and coulibaly 2005 2 4 2 hydrological model swat is a process based continuous hydrological model which divides each sub basin into smaller hydrological response units hrus i e it is a semi distributed model neitsch et al 2002 the main components of the model which are also required for this study include climate hydrology water temperature land management and channel routine neitsch et al 2011 the calibration of the model is crucial for this the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi2 algorithm was used via the swat cup software furthermore the gcm downscaled data were used as input for the model to simulate future streamflows 2 4 3 water temperature climate change causes the increase in the water temperature of rivers kędra and wiejaczka 2018 therefore it might affect the population and distribution of species in aquatic environments inoue and berg 2017 the swat simulates the water temperature using the following equation neitsch et al 2011 1 t water 5 0 0 75 t air where twater and t air are the average daily water and air temperatures c respectively however given the importance of this variable and its impact on habitat suitability we modified the swat source code and added the methodology proposed by ficklin et al 2012 this considers the impacts of air temperature snowmelt surface runoff and groundwater on water temperature through the following steps 1 local water temperature the temperature and local water contribution within the sub basin are estimated considering the volumes and temperatures of snowmelt surface groundwater and lateral inflow volumes to the stream reach within the local basin 2 initial stream temperature the temperature and inflow volume from the upstream sub basins are estimated the stream temperature before the effects of air temperature is calculated as a weighted average of the contributions within the sub basin and from the upstream sub basins 3 final stream temperature the heat transfer at the air water interface during the streamflow travel time in the sub basin is calculated therefore the final stream temperature is simulated by adding a change to the initial stream temperature in the sub basin fig 3 shows these steps and more detail on the water temperature modification in swat which is also available in ficklin et al 2012 2 4 4 iric in this study two solvers of the iric software were used to calculate the hsi for the two target fish species this software has a good resolution for tracking any change in the riverbed in other words this model creates a virtual grid on the river to simplify the evaluation of the river condition the output of the nays2dh solver which includes the water velocity and depth in the iric software was used as the input of the evatrip solver this solver takes two main steps to evaluate habitat suitability in each cell of the river grid first it calculates the physical index of discharge depth and river channel coefficients next it evaluates a fitness index si with a value between 0 and 1 based on the distribution condition or the observed data indicating the degree of selection of the physical index fig 5 oishi et al 2016 it is worth noting that the sis of the river characteristics water velocity and water depth were achieved from the iric sample data for oikawa and kawamatsu fish moreover the results of the study of choi and choi 2018 on water temperature si were used to calculate the hsi for our target fish as follows 2 hsi s i v s i d s i tw where each si represents the suitability index of habitat variables including velocity depth and flow temperature the interpolation method is also as follows fig 4 oishi et al 2016 if h k h i j h k 1 t h e n s i i j s i k s i k 1 s i k h k 1 h k h i j h k where k is the number of a certain point in the data and h k is value of hydraulic variable such as water depth and si k is suitability index for the point of k using a linear interpolation it is possible to have hsi for each cells of river grid after determining the hsi via the evatrip the wua was obtained by summing all products of the area of each mesh cell and their hsi values in the gis environment 3 wua n i hsi i a i here hsii and ai are the hsi value and surface area of the cell i respectively this parameter was computed within reach at a specific discharge as follows fig 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 generation of future climate scenarios assessing the impact of climate change on the meteorological parameters in the kikuchi basin was our first step to evaluate habitat suitability the results of the gcms show that the basin s mean annual precipitation reduces to 2100 mm for the first future period 2021 2040 under the two gcms while it is approximately 2300 mm in the baseline period 1986 2016 fig 6 however the results are different for the two following periods under hadgem2 es the annual rainfall is expected to increase by 70 and 50 mm in 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 respectively however decreases of approximately 200 and 50 mm are predicted in 2041 2060 and 2061 2080 respectively by the micro5 as shown in fig 7 the general variation of monthly rainfall patterns is the same except in september and october such uncertainties in gcms for kyushu island were also reported by kudo et al 2017 both models predicted that the basin s average annual air temperature will increase from approximately 15 c in the baseline period to 18 4 c rcp4 5 and 19 7 c rcp8 5 under hadgem2 es and micro5 respectively more details about the impacts of climate change on the kikuchi basin are available in morid et al 2019 3 2 hydrological simulations the model was calibrated using data from 1986 to 2010 and was validated by comparing the simulated and measured streamflow data from 2011 to 2015 fig 8 the swat model uses many parameters to simulate river discharge so the most sensitive parameters were selected based on the results of a sensitivity analysis the calibration parameters for the hydrological simulation and some of their best values following calibration are shown in table 1 three indicators including the coefficient of determination r2 the nash sutcliffe ns efficiency and the percent bias pbias were analyzed to test the validity of the calibration ns 0 5 and r2 0 5 were considered acceptable for the streamflow simulation pbias 10 and 10 pbias 15 indicated as a very good and good performance of the model respectively moriasi et al 2007 santhi et al 2001 using the calibrated swat and the future climate data which were based on micro5 and hadgem2 es respectively under two rcps a reduction in the stream flow in the kikuchi basin from 46 m3 s in the baseline period 1986 2016 to approximately 40 m3 s under micro5 was predicted this reduction was also predicted by hadgem2 es from 2021 to 2040 however for the two future periods from 2041 to 2060 and from 2061 to 2080 the streamflow is expected to increase by 2 and 1 m3 s respectively table 2 this disagreement between the two models is due to the uncertainties in the gcms for japan the flow duration curve fdc which represents the percentages of time flow in the river q10 q20 q30 etc was obtained fig 9 to perform a more accurate estimation of future changes in extreme events the flow corresponding to q90 should be the minimum flow available for drinking water or irrigation projects the average flow i e 50 of time flow at the kikuchi river outlet is 14 m3 s which is predicted to be the same in the future the low flow corresponding to q90 which represents the base flow is 3 m3 s and is predicted to decrease by 1 m3 s by 2080 the maximum discharge observed was 113 m3 s which will increase to 130 m3 s according to hadgem2 es rcp4 5 and decrease by up to 100 m3 s according to miicro5 rcp 8 5 this information is useful to estimate the design flood which is predicted to increase under both gcms 3 3 impact of climate change on water temperature as previously stated a new module for water temperature section 1 4 3 was included in the swat model for this study then it was calibrated for each of the seven stations located in different sub basins fig 1 because the recorded time series was short the calibration period was set from july 21 2015 to june 20 2016 and the validation period was set from august 1 2016 to september 24 2016 table 3 shows different results of the water temperature simulations before and after the swat model formula modification in general when ns 0 5 and r2 0 5 pbias 10 and the root mean square error rmse is below 3 c which are acceptable as can be seen in the table before the formula modification in most of the stations the rmse is higher than 3 c and r2 is less than 0 4 however after modification the results of calibration and validation are almost satisfactory because most of the station s coefficients are in the acceptable range except for ki1 and ku4 fig 10 shows the impact of climate change on water temperatures as can be seen from the fig the water temperature is predicted to increase by up to 5 c at both the upstream y8 station and the downstream id 3 station as the suitable water temperature for our target fish is 10 22 c froese and pauly 2019 it is assumed that this rise in the water temperature upstream will not have a significant effect on habitat suitability of the target fish however it will influence future habitat conditions downstream in other words the maximum water temperature upstream will be 17 c in july in the baseline period 1986 2016 and is expected to rise to approximately 20 c in the future which is in the range suitable for the target fish in contrast the maximum water temperature downstream will be 27 c in the baseline period and is predicted to increase to up to 30 c by 2080 july is the most critical month for both oikawa and kawamutsu fish in terms of spawning and such water temperature increases will have a negative impact on their lives 3 4 impact of climate change on hydraulic parameters one of the objectives of this study is to analyze the impact of climate change on the future hydraulic parameters in the kikuchi river as shown in table 2 the highest and lowest levels of river flow are predicted by the hadgem2 es rcp4 5 and micro5 rcp8 5 in 2041 2060 respectively by using the outputs of the swat model from these two gcms the nays2dh solver in the iric software was run for three months august january and july moreover to evaluate the changes in hydraulic parameters more accurately the river was classified into three different habitat types namely pool deep water with a smooth water surface run fast water usually deeper than a riffle and riffle fast water with a shallow water surface based on jowett s methodology jowett and richardson 1989 the results showed that despite the decreasing water depth and velocity between january and july the hydraulic parameters would increase in august by 2060 fig 11 more and stronger floods are predicted which will have various effects on the ecosystem as well as the aquatic habitat suitability 3 5 habitat suitability analyzes in terms of water temperature and hydraulic parameters the previous results showed the impacts of climate change on the streamflows of the kikuchi river the highest reduction and rise were predicted by micro5 under rcp8 5 from 46 to 41 m3 s and hadgem2 es under rcp4 5 from 46 to 48 m3 s in 2041 2060 respectively next we analyzed the impact of alterations in the characteristics of river flows e g average and min max flows velocity depth on habitat suitability these evaluations were performed for august january and july because the maximum and minimum flows occur in august and january respectively the most important month for spawning is july katano et al 2000 ynagawa et al 2007 owing to the previously mentioned issues and for brevity we only present the results for the 2041 2060 period and the three critical months 3 5 1 wua for oikawa fish fig 12 shows the wua for oikawa in the selected months obtained using the integrated modeling setup described in fig 2 to show the importance of the water temperature we evaluated the wuas with and without consideration of this variable it can be seen from the fig that the highest wua values correspond to the average discharge of the river in january which is approximately 44 000 and 7000 m2 km for adult and non adult fish respectively however when the discharge of the river is at its minimum value the wua decreases to approximately 4000 and 700 800 m2 km for adult and non adult fish fig 13 also shows the distribution of hsis along the river it can be seen from fig 13 a that the decrease in the hsi in august is mostly due to the increase in water depth and velocity which affect the future wuas interestingly although the wua is expected to decrease in january for both life stages of the adult and non adult at the minimum the river flow fig 12 the hsis in these conditions are expected to increase slightly fig 13 b this is because some parts of the river will lose water decreasing the habitable space of the oikawa fish however in other parts of the river the hsi will increase because the water depth and water velocity will decrease in contrast no significant change in the hsi is observed in july fig 13 c because oikawa fish prefer low water depths and velocities august when the discharge of the river is at its average value is not a suitable month for both adult and non adult fish at the average value of discharge the wua is expected to be approximately the same as in january and july by 2060 this condition is similar for july at the minimum value of discharge on the other hand it is expected to decrease in january at low river flows this reduction is mostly due to the decrease in the area having water this means that in the future there will be some dry areas that used to have water therefore although the hsi will increase the wua will decrease for oikawa fish in this study we also assessed the wua considering the water temperature to evaluate the extent to which this parameter can affect the hsi the results for oikawa fish showed that except january which has the minimum value of discharge the wua does not change significantly when the water temperature is not considered however the evaluation performed considering the water temperature shows that this parameter has a significant effect on the habitat suitability the decrease in the habitat suitability is visible in august and july from fig 14 interestingly while when only the hydraulic parameters were considered for the wua evaluation the habitat suitability was predicted to decrease in january the habitat suitability was expected to increase in this month when the water temperature was considered 3 5 2 wua for kawamutsu fish as can be seen from fig 15 the highest and lowest values of wua for kawamutsu fish are in january for non adult fish approximately 30000 m2 km and adult fish approximately 100 m2 km respectively generally wua is expected to decrease with the age of the fish except in august when the discharge of the river is at its minimum the habitat suitability of non adult kawamutsu fish will increase in january when the average value of discharge is observed from 32 000 to 35600 m2 km however the wua is predicted to decrease with the age of the fish because low water depths and velocities become unsuitable generally the kikuchi river does not have high habitat suitability for adult kawamutsu fish in august fig 16 a while it is better for non adult fish even at the minimum discharge value approximately 3000 m2 km which is expected to decrease by 600 m2 km by 2060 the minimum value of wua is in january at the lowest level of discharge which is expected to reduce from 143 m2 km in the baseline period to 85 m2 km in 2060 fig 16 b the wua is not appropriate for adult kawamutsu in july fig 16 c and is expected to increase slightly from 305 m2 km in the baseline period to approximately 320 m2 km in the average discharge period by 2060 nevertheless the wua for non adult fish is appropriate and it is expected to be the same in the future habitat suitability condition for kawamutsu fish is not the same for adult and juvenile fish it is expected to be lower and higher in january at the average value of discharge for adult and non adult fish this is because non adult fish prefer high water depths and velocities which are not suitable for adult fish in august the wua is expected to decrease and in january hsi will increase at the minimum value of discharge by 2060 the conditions in july are not suitable for adult kawamutsu fish but they are suitable for non adult fish at the minimum value of river flow which is expected to increase slightly in the future the results related to kawamutsu fish showed that except in august in the minimum value of discharge the wua has no notable changes however as shown in fig 17 the reduction in habitat suitability in august and july is evident interestingly habitat suitability was predicted to decrease in january for adult fish when only hydraulic parameters were used in wua calculations however when considering the water temperature habitat suitability was predicted to increase in this month moreover when the water temperature was not considered the wua was predicted not to have significant changes in july while it was predicted to decrease significantly when considering the water temperature 3 5 3 wua in flood periods moreover our research showed that the water temperature has more significant effects than floods as can be seen in fig 18 the wua does not change in the flood period for both target fish when the water temperature is not considered however it decreases when the water temperature is considered it is worth noting that the water temperature is predicted to increase by up to 5 c by 2080 which can pose a threat to both target fish especially in july which is spawning time the zacco platypus s climate zone is 10 22 c froese and pauly 2019 and our result show that the water temperature will reach 30 c by 2080 the highest water temperature rise of up to 6 c occurs from november to february this increase has significant effects on both target species the hsi increases by up to 80 in january and decreases by up to 70 in july tables 4 and 5 4 conclusion the aim of this research was to develop an integrated framework for the modeling of habitat suitability for this purpose a hybrid system was applied by linking the swat and iric models additionally due to the importance of the water temperature the relevant module of swat was modified for obtain more accurate results a shortcoming of this work is the absence of a validation procedure for the interpolation method due to lack of observed information about target fish but in any case our outcomes provide useful insights on riverine ecosystem management the most important features of the system that should be considered for better policy and decisions making in environment management are as follows impact of human activities in the basins or along the rivers on the river habitat suitability simulation of the basins under different climate scenarios and their consequences for the river habitat suitability linkage of hydrological and hydraulic indicators and their interaction for better spatial and temporal evaluations of the river habitat suitability possibility of introducing new indices for the study area and research objectives this system was applied to the kikuchi river basin under climate change conditions additionally the his index that considers the river velocity depth and water temperature was applied accordingly the region s future temperature and precipitation were predicted using two different gcms namely the hadgem2 es and micro5 under two rcps the following conclusions can be drawn for this basin 1 the application of the gcms data showed relatively high uncertainties for the future precipitation in the kyushu basin both gcms predicted that the precipitation will decrease in the period from 2021 to 2040 however the gcms made different predictions for the precipitation in 2041 2060 and 2061 280 high uncertainties in the gcms predictions for japan were also reported by kudo et al 2017 2 the innovative integrated modeling setup that linked swat and iric to simulate the hydrological and hydraulic parameters and water temperatures using the method proposed by ficklin et al 2012 successfully described the spatial variation in the hsi along the kikuchi river and the wuas in the considered sub basins thus this framework can be recommended for application to other cases 3 the introduction of the water temperature evaluation was very important in this setup in the region considered in this study using the measured data obtained at seven gauging stations it was shown that using the default water temperature formula of the swat the rmse was approximately between 4 and 13 c among the stations while the rmse was between approximately 2 and 3 c when the modified formula was used 4 it was shown that climate change can alter the river flows e g changes between 6 and 2 m3 s in the annual average when using the selected gcms the river flow reduction has both advantages and disadvantages for river habitat suitability the advantage is that both of the target fish prefer low water depth velocity therefore for instance during january while the river has a low water level the hsi will slightly increase however this water depth reduction causes some parts of the river to become dry and consequently some of the habitats may disappear 5 the results showed that the water temperature affects the habitat suitability of the target fish more than the hydraulic parameters when the habitat suitability was analyzed based on the hydraulic parameters only wua decreased by up to 5 and 40 for oikawa and kawamutsu respectively by contrast when the water temperature was considered wua decreased by up to 70 for both target fish 6 it was also shown that the downstream part of the kikuchi river is more vulnerable to climate change and its water temperature can increase to 30 c in july by contrast in the upstream part the water temperature increases to approximately 20 c which is still suitable for our target fish 7 the results raise serious concerns and imply the need for the early implementation of adaptation strategies to save the river ecosystem declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgement we are grateful for the support of the fund for the river ecology research

5419,in headwater catchment the calibration of hydrological models is complex due to the scarcity of data in mountainous areas here an innovative methodology is developed to condition hydrological model parameters by using magnetic resonance sounding mrs measurements in combination with stream flow rate data mrs has the specificity in the various geophysical imaging techniques of being mainly sensitive to the vertical distribution of water content among the subsurface in a way very similar to hydraulic head observations these local distributions of water content may serve as information in a hydrological model to pattern subsurface flow by seeking model parameters simulations are run with different sets of parameters of a hydrological model each simulation provides as an output a 4 d map 3 d spatial plus time of the vertical water content distributions over the whole catchment and their fluctuations over time this output is then used to simulate the mrs signal that would be produced by the estimated water content the simulated mrs signal is compared to measured mrs data to determine which hydrological simulations which model parameters are close to observations the approach is applied on a hard rock headwater catchment housing a very shallow and thin aquifer where an mrs survey covers the whole studied site hydraulic parameters of an integrated hydrological model of the catchment are spatially distributed by zones with uniform values the prior delineation of the zones being guided by pedological studies as mrs measurements supply local but spatially distributed information the method conditions the various zones on their parameter values in a much better way than the classical in headwater catchments measure of the stream flow rate at the outlet of the system finally hydrological simulation and time dependent mrs forward calculations can help identifying possible locations for mrs stations to monitor the transient behavior of the hydrological state of the catchment keywords hydrological model parameters geophysics magnetic resonance sounding headwater catchment hard rock aquifer 1 introduction headwater catchments are widely used for water supply services and therefore represent essential reservoirs for water resources management winter 2007 blumstock et al 2016 the evolution of groundwater storage in such systems in response to climatic forcing is also of great importance as it controls the amount of water and elements released to the downstream part of rivers supports ecosystem services and strongly impacts the amplitude of streamflow during low flow and high flow periods rinderer et al 2014 blumstock et al 2016 water circulation in such environments is complex as it is shaped by the strong heterogeneity of the subsurface medium and lacks homogenization usually brought by large scale systems beven et al 1988 ameli et al 2016 chorover et al 2017 kim et al 2017 riebe et al 2017 dwivedi et al 2019 in the context of hard rock geology the spatial variability of the hydraulic properties from the superficial soils to the deeper bedrock substantially impacts the hydrological catchment response to rainfall banks et al 2009 gannon et al 2014 diek et al 2014 mcmillan and srinivasan 2015 welch and allen 2014 singh et al 2018 moreover the interfaces between the different subsurface compartments i e soil saprolite fractured bedrock and fresh bedrock might be of complex geometry influencing groundwater flow paths and the associated transit and residence times of water koch et al 2009 kosugi et al 2011 welch and allen 2014 gabrielli et al 2012 rempe and dietrich 2014 comte et al 2019 characterizing the heterogeneity of the hydraulic parameters in the subsurface and the geometry of the subsurface layers is still a challenge in hydrology salve et al 2012 koïta et al 2017 comte et al 2019 a proper characterization is nonetheless critical to reduce equifinality issues when using models that describe the water cycle at the catchment scale this is especially true for headwater catchments because these systems likely conceal a strong variability in terms of soil properties topographic interfaces and lithology indeed geochemical data analyses using tracer data highlighted the heterogeneity of the reservoirs supplying mountainous streams koch et al 2017 kim et al 2017 wymore et al 2017 modeling the streamflow at the outlet of a catchment was also shown to render non unique solutions due to the aggregated nature of the data convoluting the effects of various local behaviors and heterogeneities over the whole system ebel and loague 2006 calibrating a model by relying upon streamflow data only is known to be inefficient or at least highly uncertain the classical hydrogeological strategy that consists of fitting piezometric data from open boreholes remains arduous to set up in mountainous contexts where the field is hardly accessible to drilling works in addition piezometric data provide limited information regarding headwater catchments which means that only the local position of the water table is given when very shallow and thin aquifers would be better documented by measurements of the water content evolution with depth alternative strategies are needed to properly constrain hydrological models able to produce reliable simulations of the transient response of headwater catchments and thus improve our current understanding of streamflow generation processes in such environments weill et al 2019 the use of geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity seismic tomography or ground penetrating radar provides insights into the structure of subsurface systems and allows for defining zones of different properties including the thickness of hydraulically active layers koch et al 2009 befus et al 2011 cassidy et al 2014 holbrook et al 2014 parsekian et al 2015 soulsby et al 2016 olyphant et al 2016 orlando et al 2016 koïta et al 2017 flinchum et al 2018a time lapse experiments also inform on the processes driving the water circulation along hillslopes or in a catchment cassiani et al 2009 angermann et al 2017 jackisch et al 2017 scaini et al 2018 hübner et al 2017 kotikian et al 2019 in the first step the images of geophysical properties provide qualitative information on the subsurface structures or on the active dynamic processes in the second step petrophysical relationships allow a deeper interpretation of geophysical information by rendering a quantitative estimate of hydraulic parameters such as porosity tureson 2006 mota and monteiro santos 2010 holbrook et al 2014 rehman et al 2016 flinchum et al 2018b comte et al 2019 water content daily et al 1992 turesson 2006 mota and monteiro santos 2010 or sometimes hydraulic conductivity values chen et al 2001 slater 2007 léger et al 2014 gottschalk et al 2017 some developments of coupled inversions between geophysical data and hydrological models help to cope with the uncertainties stemming from deterministic inversions converting geophysical signals into images of the subsurface properties for example coupled inversions allow for by passing the effects of a degrading resolution of the geophysical image with depth or a smoothing effect related to the regularization applied to address the non unicity of the solutions hinnell et al 2010 binley et al 2015 however coupled inversions still require the use of empirically estimated petrophysical relationships whose application remains risky at a catchment scale in fact the petrophysical relationships may vary spatially as they rest on links between hydraulic and geophysical properties that are specific to a given site the scale investigated and the geological settings of the studied domain christensen et al 2016 magnetic resonance soundings mrs provide data that are directly sensitive to the subsurface water content without resorting to any variable petrophysical law legchenko et al 2004 costabel and günther 2014 the acquisition of such data is non invasive and supplies information concerning both the saturated and unsaturated zones of the subsurface mazzilli et al 2016 mrs measurements offer a direct estimate of the aquifer s free water content from which the effective porosity is deduced when the thickness of water bearing layers is provided by other data they also allow for evaluating indirectly the hydraulic conductivity via calibrations from pumping tests legchenko et al 2004 or sampling analysis mohnke and yaramanci 2008 an mrs survey performed on a network of stations strategically designed offers the opportunity to obtain direct insights on the spatial distribution of hydraulic variables at the catchment scale even if the system shows a strong spatial heterogeneity in terms of lithology or mineralogy furthermore mrs measurements integrate the subsurface water content over plugs depending on the geometry of the acquisition device but they are usually of a few tens of meters in lateral and vertical extension legchenko et al 2004 such sizes are comparable to the classical mesh resolution a few tens of m of hydrological models for small catchments 1 10 km2 thus more easily rendering the integration of mrs data into a modeling task to date most studies based on mrs data are devoted to systems where the thickness of the saprolite and the weathered bedrock are of a few tens of meters legchenko et al 2006 descloitres et al 2008 francés et al 2014 vouillamoz et al 2014 2015 koïta et al 2018 sites affected by ice age footprints show much thinner saprolite and weathered bedrock layers with thicknesses of a few meters due to intense erosion processes fichter et al 1998b sailhac et al 2009 comte et al 2019 despite the difficulty of probing the very shallow subsurface the combination of mrs data with other geophysical methods is very fruitful for revealing information on the saprolite and weathered rock hydraulic properties wyns et al 2004 baltassat et al 2005 sailhac et al 2009 comte et al 2019 in most of the previous studies reported by the literature mrs data are classically inverted to estimate the medium porosity and its hydraulic conductivity this information is later used as a prior guess in hydrological models at the hillslope or the catchment scale lubczynski and gurwin 2005 boucher et al 2012 comte et al 2019 nevertheless equifinality issues arise in the reconstruction process of the vertical distribution of water content and layer thicknesses that should condition the hydrological model costabel and günther 2014 this downside is emphasized when hydraulic conductivity estimates rest on empirical relationships that might spatially vary over the catchment nonetheless the coupling of mrs data with hydrogeological models is a powerful strategy to tackle non unicity issues as reported by a few studies to model pumping tests herckenrath et al 2012 vilhelmsen et al 2014 the capillary fringe costabel and günther 2014 the evaporation in the first centimeters of soils merz et al 2018 or the water movement in variably saturated media legchenko et al 2020 in this study an alternative methodology is proposed the idea is to turn upside down the classical formalism described previously and use mrs measurements as posterior information to constrain the subsurface parameters of the hydrological model instead of determining a prior spatial distribution of the hydraulic properties and the aquifer geometry from mrs the data are used as a calibration observation in the hydrological model as would be classical streamflow measurements or piezometric data the water content simulated by the hydrological model for a given set of model parameters is used to compute the resulting mrs signals that are then compared to the measured data the quality of fitting between mrs simulations and data then serves as the trigger to change in a monte carlo approach the set of hydrological parameters as a proof of concept this methodology is applied to the strengbach catchment a mountainous catchment belonging to the french network of critical zone observatories pierret et al 2018 the model used in the study is an integrated hydrological model i e a model that couples surface and subsurface flow processes called nihm normally integrated hydrological model pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 jeannot et al 2018 both streamflow and mrs data are employed to define a set of parameters allowing for describing both the hydrological response at the outlet and the local evolution of subsurface water content identified by mrs measurements the quality of the optimal set of parameters is then assessed using a long term streamflow chronicle the paper is organized as follows section 2 is dedicated to the presentation of the mrs method and the computation of mrs signals from water content estimates section 3 details the hydrological modeling strategy with emphasis on the assumptions that ground the nihm model and the way the water content is estimated in section 4 the field application of the proposed methodology is described the results are presented and discussed in the last section of the paper 2 mrs method 2 1 principle and implementation mrs is a geophysical method directly sensitive to the quantity of water molecules present in the subsurface mrs is conducted by recording the response of energized nuclei of hydrogen atoms only contained in water molecules in the absence of hydrocarbon to do so an alternating current is injected at fixed pulse moments and larmor frequency in wire loops of decametric size placed on the ground surface the pulse moment corresponds to the product of the injected current intensity by the pulse duration and the larmor frequency represents the precessing frequency of the hydrogen nuclear spins and depends on the local geomagnetic field legchenko and valla 2002 then the excited spins of the hydrogens nuclei are forced to tilt away from their equilibrium state after the energizing pulse is switched off spins relax back to their initial state the nuclei of hydrogen atoms reemit the accumulated energy producing an electromagnetic signal legchenko et al 2004 the same wire loops can be used to measure the temporal variation of the voltage induced by the electromagnetic response the recorded signal oscillates at larmor frequency and decays at a characteristic relaxation time t 2 z which depends on the pore space characteristics the mrs noise amplitude is generally evaluated by recording environmental noise over a duration similar to the mrs recording time with the same loop but before the mrs exciting pulse is emitted the overall measuring protocol described just above is called free induction decay fid in the specific cases where the subsurface medium has significant magnetic properties the fid signal can be perturbed but protocols called spin echo can be used by injecting a second electromagnetic pulse shushakov and fomenko 2004 legchenko et al 2010 grunewald et al 2014 the mrs measured signal is all the more sensitive to the deeper part of the subsurface that the loop is wider or the injected pulse is stronger the classical strategy is to fix the dimension of the loop such as it corresponds to the maximum sounded depth contemplated measurements are then repeated with different pulses of higher energy to progressively increase the depth sounded in the subsurface legchenko 2002 classically an inversion is then performed to reconstruct the vertical distribution of the water content θ z and the relaxation time t 2 z a higher subsurface water content induces a stronger amplitude of the measured signal with the consequence that media characterized by a very small water content are susceptible to show low signal to noise ratios most mrs equipment used for aquifer characterization is only sensitive to free water which can move under gravity driven forces but is not able to detect bound water as for example inter layer water molecules in clay minerals boucher et al 2011 large values of t 2 z indicate a coarse material while smaller values correspond to a fine grained material t 2 is related to the transversal relaxation time of the mrs signal t 2 by 1 t 2 1 t 2 μ δ b 0 2 where μ is the gyromagnetic ratio for protons and δ b 0 the magnetic gradient at the pore scale t 2 reflects directly the pore space characteristics because 1 t 2 ρ 2 s pore v pore kleinberg et al 1994 kenyon 1997 with ρ 2 being the surface relaxivity i e the property of the surface of the rocks to enhance relaxation and s pore and v pore corresponding to the inner surface and the volume of the pores respectively empirical but also more sophisticated models are able to link the mrs response of rocks to their permeability and saturation falzone and keating 2016 dlugosch et al 2013 however reliable values of t 2 are required for estimating the rock permeability or the pores characteristics vouillamoz et al 2012 2 2 mrs model assuming a vertical distribution of the water content θ z and a mono exponential relaxation characteristic time t 2 z the mrs envelop v q t decaying with time t for a pulse moment q can be written as legchenko and valla 2002 1 v q t z κ q z θ z exp t t 2 z dz the 1 d time invariant kernel function κ q z of the mrs vertical sensitivity is conditioned by the geomagnetic field amplitude and the larmor frequency the electrical resistivity distribution the geometry of the acquisition system i e the shape and the size of the injecting collecting wire loop the amplitude of the injected pulse current q the distribution of the subsurface layers in which θ z and t 2 z are provided the use of the mrs signal envelop integrated along the recording time is particularly relevant when the measured signal to noise ratio is weak because of a small water content or a strong environmental noise the signal to noise ratio of the integrated mrs signal is increased by averaging real and imaginary parts of the signal in the same envelope while avoiding vast loss of information from eq 1 the integrated signal a est q of the estimated mrs signal over time writes 2 a est q z k q z θ z t 2 z exp t s t 2 z exp t e t 2 z d z with t s the acquisition start time and t e the end of the acquisition time the fit quality between the estimated and measured mrs signals i e the objective function can then be expressed by comparing a est q with the measured signal area a mes q which error is estimated by the measured noise area a noise q a mes q and a noise q that are also integrated values over time are both computed using the trapezium rule on the raw measurements 2 3 mrs model parameterization in this study we propose to use mrs data as a posterior information to condition a hydrological model simulating water flows at the catchment scale the water content vertical distribution θ z at the locations of mrs station is supplied by one of the hydrological model outputs as described in the following section the fact remains that the vertical distribution of the variable t 2 z should be prescribed to solve eq 2 those values are determined via a simple least square technique we limited at two the number of sought t 2 z values to reduce equifinality issues associated with an excessive number of parameters to do so the raw mrs measurements are post processed by seeking for each pulse q the best model w q t for the envelope of the signal measured over time as 3 w q t a app q exp t t 2 app q where a app and t 2 app respectively correspond to the apparent amplitude and the apparent relaxation terms of the raw signal measured in the field examples of the estimation of a app and t 2 app to fit the signals acquired for the different pulses applied at the mrs stations are shown in lesparre et al submitted data also available at http hplus ore fr en lesparre et al 2020 joh data the aim of this fit is simply to get an insight on the t 2 med median t 2 app q values for each station t 2 med being used later as a prior estimate of the t 2 z that shapes the simulated mrs signal eq 2 assuming that t 2 z is relatively homogeneous over depth its prior value is set to t 2 med and its variation range is bounded by 0 2 t 2 med and 5 t 2 med the t 2 med estimated for the different stations are summarized in table 1 in lesparre et al submitted the t 2 med estimate is an apparent value which does not reflect the t 2 z of the subsurface therefore no interpretation is made on the t 2 med values 3 hydrological model 3 1 the normally integrated hydrological model nihm nihm is physically based and spatially distributed hydrological model to describe and couple the flow processes occurring in the surface and subsurface compartments of a catchment from local to regional scales pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 jeannot et al 2018 the model describes flows in the subsurface in a 1 d stream network and over the 2 d land surface only 1 d routing via the stream network and subsurface flow are presented below since diffuse 2 d surface run off or exfiltration from the subsurface have never been evidenced at the strengbach catchment the absence of surface run off is associated with the presence of sandy soils that favor rapid infiltration pierret et al 2018 even over steep slopes that usually trigger run off nihm belongs to the so called simplified low dimensional models mainly because the full 3 d richards equation for flow in the subsurface is integrated along a direction perpendicular to the substratum with the idea to treat the subsurface compartment as a single two dimensional layer to this end flow within the 3 d subsurface domain is modeled through a 2 d equation while hydraulic parameters are defined in several layers the variation of the hydraulic parameters over depth is then taken into account when performing the flow integration perpendicularly to the substratum via mean integral parameters over the saturated and unsaturated thicknesses of the subsurface this technique drastically reduces the meshing effort the required memory space and the computational cost while preserving the physics especially for systems with a contrasted topography as in the strengbach catchment the description of flow in the 1 d stream network is based on a 1 d formulation of the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equations that neglects inertial effects over very short periods 100 s eventually occurring in surface routed flow the set of equations that are solved can be written as 4 θ i h t s h h t x y t θ x y h q w 5 l r h r t x k p x h r z r l r γ 1 d with θ i h z w z s θ z d z s h s s sat h t h θ k sat h z w z s k θ z d z k sat lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor and s s sat l 1 is the specific storage capacity in the saturated zone both are averaged along the integration direction z l θ is the water content k lt 1 is the tensor of hydraulic conductivity h l is the hydraulic head or the capillary head in the subsurface q w lt 1 is a source sink term that accounts for both injection withdraw in the system and interactions with the 1 d river network and z w z s l are the local coordinates along the direction z normal to substratum of the water table and land surface respectively h r l is the water depth in the river network z r l is the elevation of the river bed l r l is the wetted width in the river k p l3t 1 is a conduction term that depends on geometrical parameters of the network the manning roughness coefficient and the surface water depth h r and γ 1 d lt 1 is a source sink term accounting for the stream network interactions with the subsurface for the application to the strengbach catchment we consider that the hydraulic conductivity tensors k and k sat are isotropic so they are reduced to the scalar values k and k sat respectively interactions coupling between the surface and subsurface compartments rely upon a first order approximation setting the exchanged water fluxes between the compartments as proportional to the head difference between the compartments the equations are solved together using a fully implicit approach and advanced numerical schemes a full description of the model and of the numerical techniques is available in jeannot et al 2018 various comparisons and bench tests weill et al 2017 jeannot et al 2018 showed that simplifications brought by nihm in the flow processes did not jeopardize accurate applications to complex hydrosystems jeannot et al 2019 3 2 water content estimate nihm calculates the water pressure expressed in height of fluid above a given elevation ψ l in each element of the catchment model and at each observation time from ψ the van genuchten 1980 equations can provide the vertical distribution of the water content θ z which is then used for the mrs signal estimates compared with observations for each hydrologic simulation nihm can supply outputs in the form of 4 d maps of water content 3 d spatial plus time as nihm is characterized by a two dimensional integrated subsurface compartment the three dimensional reconstruction of the water content in the subsurface needs a few explanations for the sake of simplicity but without loss of generality it is dealt hereafter with a horizontal aquifer where the vertical direction z is that of the normal to substratum direction of integration employed by nihm in nihm the hypothesis is that subsurface flow is mainly parallel to the substratum which implies that for darcian flow there will be an instantaneous hydrostatic equilibrium along the z direction with the hydraulic head gradient component h z 0 for an incompressible fluid at hydrostatic equilibrium and with very small fluid velocity i e neglecting kinetic energy of the fluid the bernoulli s theorem states that at any elevation z p above a prescribed reference between the substratum z b and the surface z s along the vertical direction z h ψ p z p where ψ p corresponds to the water pressure at the elevation z p the null gradient h z 0 assumes that h is uniform over z at the value of the saturated water table elevation z w therefore ψ p z w z p which renders positive values in the saturated zone z b z p z w and negative values in the unsaturated zone z w z p z s it is worth noting that nihm can calculate hydraulic heads h z w beneath the substratum z b in that case the aquifer is completely unsaturated along z but the calculation of ψ still applies in the same vein for hydraulic heads h z w above the surface z s the system is always saturated locally along the direction z exfiltration from the subsurface through the surface occurs and ψ is always positive along z knowing the values ψ z at any elevation z the van genuchten 1980 equations provide the vertical distribution of the water content in the form 6 θ z θ s θ r 1 α ψ z n m θ r if ψ 0 θ s if ψ 0 where θ is the effective saturation θ s is the saturated water content and θ r is the residual water content α is a parameter related to the mean pore size l 1 n is a parameter reflecting the uniformity of the pore size distribution and m is a parameter defined by m 1 1 n mualem 1976 the notation in eq 6 overlooks the eventual variability over the direction z of all parameters e g θ s z 4 overall methodology 4 1 workflow a flowchart

a loop with the re assignment of the nihm parameters within the defined zones of the catchment until reaching fair fits of both mrs and flow rate data 4 2 fitting criteria for the calibration process nihm simulations are run over an eight month period from october 1 2012 to may 31 2013 the first four months are used to warm up the simulations rendering them independent of eventually flawed initial conditions while the remaining four months allow for the calibration of nihm with simulated mrs data and flow rate at the outlet compared with the corresponding observations the evaluation of the flow rate fit quality is computed using the kling gupta efficiency kge the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the root mean square error rmse criteria defined as 7 kge r 1 2 η 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the

populated with spruces mainly piceas abies l 80 and beeches fagus sylvatica l 20 the watershed covers approximately 0 8 km2 of surface area in which the elevation ranges between 883 and 1146 masl heavily incised slopes pattern the topography with an average slope of 15 but locally reaching up to 30 fig 2 two main hillsides compose the catchment displaying distinct meteorological and topographic parameters related to their respective orientation the south eastern hillside is mainly north exposed with weaker slopes and it is usually colder more humid and rainier than the south exposed north western hillside the bedrock of the catchment is mainly composed of hercynian granite poor in calcium 315 7millionyr micro granite and gneiss also outcrop locally along the southern and northern hillsides respectively el gh mari 1995 above the bedrock soils are approximately 1 m thick with a coarsely grained texture sandy and rich in gravel fichter et al 1998a the thickness of the granitic saprolite heavily weathered rock is estimated to vary between 1 and 9 m with a southern hillside presumably having a thicker weathered layer compared with the northern side el gh mari 1995 however the shallow subsurface of the northern hillside exhibits a higher macroporosity compared with the southern hillside a denser network of fissures fractures is indeed expected as granites on the northern slope have been altered by hydrothermal circulations that occurred 180 my ago fichter et al 1998b a delimitation of pedologic zones has been drawn from a structural study of the slope incision complemented by the analysis of 44 soil profiles covering the whole catchment and by field observations of geomorphological and geological features fig 2 acrisols cover the crests and the slopes of the catchment with podzols also present along the slopes colluviums cover the flat zone at the spring of the main stream while the area encompassing the stream outlet is covered by gleysoils i e a wetland soil almost permanently water saturated surrounding that gleysoil zone the soil is of ranker type narrow corridors of brown earths occur where the slopes are steep and the water saturation potential is high fig 2 5 2 hydrological and meteorological data the strengbach catchment has been monitored since 1986 by the observatoire hydro géochimique de l environnement ohge http ohge unistra fr cnrs university of strasbourg the hydro meteorological data sets collected during the last 30 years provide a unique material for studying the hydrological functioning of small mountainous headwater catchments pierret et al 2018 they allow for evaluating the impact of climate change on various hydrological and vegetation processes and discussing issues related to sustainability of water resources in forested mountainous environments beaulieu et al 2016 two meteorological stations one located on the northern crest and the other close to the stream outlet of the catchment monitor the rainfall temperature and relative humidity the upper station also monitors the global radiation wind speed and snow cover thickness seven additional rain gauges render information on the variability of the rainfall spatial distribution the average precipitation over the catchment is estimated from the value measured at the northern crest and then multiplied by a corrective factor determined by analyzing the relationships between the rain gauges spatially distributed over the catchment viville et al 1993 pierret et al 2019 the evapotranspiration is estimated as being the atmospheric demand evaluated by the penman formula 1948 an h flume continuously gauges the stream discharge at the outlet fig 2 other flumes are placed along the main stream or along secondary tributaries and are used to collect intermittent local data fortnightly among those the razs standing for ruisseau en amont de la zone saturée ie upstream the saturated zone flume monitored the discharge continuously during a few months for a temporary experiment in 1996 fig 2 nine boreholes were drilled in 2012 and 2013 with a depth varying between 15 and 120 m mainly for sampling rock cores these boreholes are deep enough to intercept a few fractures in the bedrock which renders the water levels monitored in these open boreholes unable to reflect hydraulic pressure heads in the active shallow porous aquifer of the catchment the local climate is of temperate oceanic mountainous type the analysis of ohge data in the 2007 2016 period shows a mean annual temperature of 6 c with mean monthly temperatures varying between 2 c and 14 5 c the average raw precipitation amounts to 1340 mm yr 1 intermittent snowfall occurs during two to four months in a year with inter annual variations from 1136 to 1594 mm yr 1 the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated at 588 mm yr 1 with values ranging between 544 and 637 mm yr 1 the strengbach catchment collects different sources and streamlets and the mean flow rate at the outlet of the main stream is 666 mm yr 1 with inter annual variations between 584 and 904 mm yr 1 to close the water budget the volumes extracted for the water supply of the aubure village should also be accounted for as they represent approximately 14 of the total annual volume exiting the system by the stream this annual average withdraw for water supply is 92 mm yr 1 and varies between 72 and 133 mm yr 1 5 3 mrs measurements using the mono channel mrs system numisplus device from iris instruments we performed 32 mrs measurements two campaigns in april and may 2013 investigated 23 sites eight shaped loops were used as previous tests and showed the ability of such a geometry to reduce the ambient noise boucher et al 2015 the eight shaped loops were made of two squares each being of 37 5or 40 m on each side depending on the available cables thus the maximum sounded depth was of about 40 m and the information on the water content vertical distribution collected in the datasets was expected to be relatively coarse indeed no information was available about the groundwater circulation at the time the mrs measurements were carried out therefore the strategy was simply to record soundings able to provide an overall information on the water content distribution with noises measured before the acquisition and not synchronously interpretation methods using remote but synchronous noise measurements were inapplicable dalgaard et al 2012 however eight shaped loops with 200 to 300 stacks were used and some recent tests in the field with a multi channel mrs system did not show any improvement thus the eight shaped loop strategy remained the most efficient in this specific catchment compared with filtering based on remote noise measurements acquisition protocols corresponding to either free induction decay fid or spin echo se signals were collected depending on the station indeed the occurrence of magnetic minerals associated with past hydrothermal activity on the northern slope allowed some se recordings in this part nevertheless we decided to use only fid signals in this study because of their higher amplitude and their availability at all mrs stations finally only 16data sets stations were kept covering fairly well the southern part of the catchment while only a few stations remained useful on the northern hillside fig 3 in addition for the selected data sets only measurements performed with the weaker injected pulses q 2000 a ms were kept because the signals of higher pulse moments were not sensitive enough to the shallow distribution of the water content data processing was done with the samovar 11x4 software a package developed at the institut de recherche pour le développement ird france as mentioned in section 2 the measured signal was strongly affected by environmental noise mainly because the mrs signal amplitude was weak with a maximum amplitude of about 50nv for our study site characteristics after a time out of 40 ms the acquisitions were recorded with a sampling rate of 2 ms last between 205 and 466 ms however to compute a mes q we applied the time integration only over the first 162 ms after the time out of the recording because the final measurements showed strong fluctuations due to the exponential decrease of the signal that was rapidly vanishing over time and much more sensitive to the ambient noises at long acquisition times a previous analysis of the mrs measurements rendered a qualitative depiction of the subsurface water volume distribution in the catchment boucher et al 2015 pierret et al 2018 the map of the water volume concealed in the weathered layer of the system shows some variability strongly correlated with the pedologic zonation fig 2 the gneissic and clayed rock materials of the northern crest might prohibit the detection of subsurface water by mrs measurements boucher et al 2015 on the northern hillside the shallow subsurface is made of fissured fractured granites altered by intense past hydrothermal circulations there the estimated water volume is intermediate and might feed perennial flow overtime boucher et al 2015 the southern hillside which is less altered fichter et al 1998b shows smaller water content with a drier vadose zone less prone to infiltration finally the water content is higher underneath the wetland in the downstream part of the catchment and under the flat colluvium zone which would be the thickest porous subarea of the catchment boucher et al 2015 5 4 parameters set up given the catchment characteristics in this study the 2 d mesh used for the subsurface flow computation in nihm is refined close to the streams to model accurately the surface and subsurface coupling fig 3 the mesh is also refined close to the mrs stations to provide accurate information on the subsurface water content distribution the 2 d mesh is made of 10 249 triangular elements delineated between 5260 nodes the 1 d stream network is extended upward to the actual stream path to form the water routing associated with the logging roads since they behave intermittently as brooks the 1 d mesh is drawn by 828 segments joining 821 nodes specifically for the application to the strengbach catchment nihm was parameterized by following a delineation in zones derived from the pedological map figs 2 and 3 hydraulic parameters within each zone are uniform and the characteristics of these zones are reported in table1 the acrisols of weathered slopes that present similar pedologic characteristics in orange in fig 2 are distinguished according to their location on either the northern or the southern hillsides of the catchment indeed those two hillsides are distinguished in terms of thickness and porosity of aquifer layers because of their different level of alteration fichter et al 1998b the regions corresponding to the narrow corridors of brown earth in green in fig 2 are overlooked the water content is extracted from the nihm 3 d maps in the vicinity of each mrs station at the time the mrs data were acquired the water content values are extracted inside a vertical cylinder of 40 m diameter centered on each mrs station then the water content are averaged to build a 1 d model of water content θ z varying with the depth z below ground level from this θ z model the mrs signal is computed as described in section 2 before being compared with field measurements the exploration of the mrs data sensitivity was limited to two main parameters of nihm the aquifer thickness normal to the topographic surface and the porosity which is considered as equivalent to the saturated water content θ s several exploratory calculations were performed to estimate the volume of the aquifer required to simulate the outlet flow rate dynamic of this very reactive catchment for example a thin single layer aquifer with a uniform porosity of 8 is able to reproduce the outlet flow rate fairly well the thickness of the single layer can vary over space between 2 and 8 m and more than 20 single layer models evenly fit the outlet flow rate with a kge 0 88 a nse 0 87 and a rmse 6 96 l s 1 these examples illustrate the equifinality issue encountered when only the outlet flow rate is available by contrast the single layer models fail to correctly reproduce the mrs data in particular station 22 shows a χ 2 10 irrespective of the parameter values when representing the subsurface with a single layer fig 4 a the mrs measurements are in fact very sensitive to the contrast in water content between a thin one meter or so very superficial strongly altered zone of soil and beneath a deeper layer showing a porosity strongly decreasing with depth corresponding to the saprolite thus in each zone of the catchment we sought the thickness and the porosity for a two layer model as depicted in fig 5 the superficial layer represents the soil that might be relatively thin but with higher porosity than the underlying saprolite susceptible to be thicker but with smaller porosity fig 5 this type of geometry for the shallow subsurface has often been evoked in other mountainous hard rock sites befus et al 2011 holbrook et al 2014 2019 orlando et al 2016 flinchum et al 2018a the other parameters of nihm reported in table 2 were prescribed as uniform values over the whole catchment except for the k sat parameter all the other parameters in table2 do not have a strong effect on the model outputs the values of α and n parameters in the van genuchten model are chosen close to that discussed in a hydrological modeling inter comparison performed by maxwell et al 2014 the k sat value is fixed to limit the space of parameters to explore as already mentioned nihm outputs render an estimate of the water content in all the active layers constituting the aquifer from the surface to the bedrock however some water could be present below the soil and saprolite layers the active aquifer of the catchment inducing a signal recorded in the mrs raw data for example water in the weathered bedrock could be detected by mrs even if this water contributes to neither the very transient superficial hydrology nor the stream flow rate with this in mind we choose to allow some degree of freedom to the fit of mrs data by considering the eventual existence of water content in various layers beneath the shallow aquifer modeled by nihm the bottom limit of this deeper medium is set to 30 m below the ground surface and the deeper medium is divided into 6 layers between the bottom of the nihm aquifer and the lower limit fig 5 θ z in the threeshallower layers of the weathered bedrock might range between 0 and 0 005 while the threedeeper layers θ z might range between 0 and 0 03 the first three layers in the weathered bedrock with very small water content help both the mrs estimates and the hydrological modeling to clearly delineate the interface between the active shallow aquifer and the weathered bedrock the three deeper layers in the weathered bedrock with higher but still small water content help to retrieve water concealed in depth as evidenced by the first analysis of the mrs datasets boucher et al 2015 as nihm only provides estimates of the water content θ z in the shallow aquifer the values of θ z in the six underlying bedrock layers are unknown those values are sought during the least square inversion in the step 5 of the workflow that also looks for two values of t 2 z one assigned to the shallow aquifer modeled by nihm and the other to the six layers of the weathered bedrock fig 5 mrs data reflect the state of local water content in the subsurface but for systems flowing rapidly such as the hillslopes of the catchment this local state might also depend on the water circulation in regions located upward and downward from the acquisition point in other words the water locally stored beneath the mrs stations depends on the hydraulic properties of the upward and downward regions as an example stations 5 and 9 are shown to be sensitive to the hydrodynamic parameters of the zones located upward therefore when seeking the model parameters in nihm to fit mrs data the search is first carried out for the contributing regions represented by the crests and the upper parts of the hillsides then the parameters are explored downward toward the valley draining the whole catchment this procedure is intended to progressively fit the whole mrs data set together with the outlet flow rate of the stream in the valley 6 results and discussion 6 1 hydrogeophysical data fit an example of the set of parameters fairly well fitting the mrs data and the outlet flow is given in table3 presently no complementary geophysical data are available to validate this set of parameters loggings from six boreholes confirm the observed tendency of a soil thickness relatively homogeneous around 1 m while the saprolite thickness is more susceptible to vary with higher values in zone 2 other sets of parameters with values close to those presented in table 3 could also reproduce this data set however an mrs data set with a reduced noise level and a higher sensitivity to the shallow medium is required to perform a quantitative study of the parameters set confidence interval as discussed below the resulting porosity values might seem low in both the soil and saprolite layers sometimes with values as low as 0 1 in the soil and 0 02 in the saprolite table 3 it is worth noting that they correspond to an average value of the porosity in each layer moreover they reflect the effective porosity since the hydrological model only takes into account the porosity that enables water circulation this is consistent with the mrs signal that is mostly influenced by the water contained in the effective porosity the quality of fitting between data and simulations is reported for each mrs station 0 5 χ 2 2 5 fig 4b and for the outlet flow rate kge 0 86 rmse 6 08 l s 1 nse 0 91 fig 6 a longer period is shown in fig 6 compared to the one used for calibration tests of nihm february 1 2013 to may 31 2013 the idea is to show the forcing variations until the beginning of september 2013 because it is also discussed below of synthetic tests conducted to estimate the mrs signal until that date simulations with the same set of parameters were also run a over a few months during spring 1996 when the stream flow rate was also monitored continuously at the razs station fig 3 and b between the beginning of september 2008 and the end of august 2016 such simulations show a fair agreement with field flow rate measurements as a kge value of 0 7 is estimated at razs and at the outlet for the 1996 period for the 2008 2016 simulation the kge is 0 84 the porous space available for subsurface flow circulation corresponding to the selected set of parameters is illustrated in fig 7 mapping the porous volume in the subsurface per unit of surface area of the aquifer this quantity is simply estimated by multiplying the thicknesses of the subsurface layers by their corresponding porosity θ s the state of the water content at the date of the first mrs acquisition the 12th of april 2013 is mapped in fig 8 the water volume at that time is strongly patterned by the porous space available fig 7 the boundaries of the zones dividing the catchment fig 3 are emphasized by strong variations of the concealed water volume because of the abrupt variations of the aquifer thicknesses zone 2 which is located upstream from the main springs shows a high water volume despite its lower porous space compared with zones 1 and 3 this observation can be explained by its small slope allowing the area to better store water than an area of steep slopes where water flows rapidly under gravity driven forces a disparity is observed between the northern and southern slopes of the catchment as witnessed by zones 4 and 5 despite their similar available porous space the southern slope zone4 shows a slightly higher water volume here again this can be explained by the steeper slopes of zone5 that favor downward drainage the water content estimated by nihm beneath each mrs station is strongly patterned by the zone in which the station is located fig 9 all mrs stations within a given zone respond similarly in terms of the water content modeled by nihm with the exception of station 8 which appears as an outlier in zone 4 close to the boundaries of zones 2 3 and 4 except for stations 9 and 14 fitting the whole mrs data set requires the presence of water in depth in the weathered bedrock to reproduce the measurements fig 9 although the inversion lacks constraints to quantitatively evaluate the corresponding amount of water present in depth we infer the presence of water in the weathered bedrock beneath the active shallow aquifer it should be noted that deep water is not necessary to reproduce the amplitude and the variability of the outlet flow rate the mrs data are in general explained by nihm simulations fig 4b and 10 and despite the low water content and the noise level the method provides constraints on the nihm parameters for example two layers with contrasting thickness and porosity must compose the shallow aquifer to reproduce the mrs signal together with the outlet flow rate mrs data also provide an insight into the spatial distribution of parameters thanks to the local but spatially distributed nature of the measurements now it has been confirmed that the active aquifer is very superficial another set up of mrs measurements could be useful to improve the parameter estimates it is noteworthy that mrs data in the form they have been collected are of limited resolution in the shallow subsurface in the absence of hydrological modeling when mrs data were collected in 2013 the medium was sounded over several tens of meters in depth as is classically performed for a first acquisition in unconstrained aquifers synchronous noise measurements using a remote loop could also help to reduce the noise level dalgaard et al 2012 finally mrs data are not free from equifinality issues when seeking the porosity and the thickness of the watered layers thus complementary information about the aquifer thickness and porosity are required to better constrain these parameters the knowledge of the subsurface seismic velocity variations at the scale of the catchment could help in constraining the porosity distribution and hence the aquifer thickness diversity flinchum et al 2018b similarly we did not attempt to interpret the t 2 z values obtained in this study see table 2 in lesparre et al submitted as it is very likely that they might be non unique therefore we do not consider that the various estimated values t 2 z could also reflect the spatial variations of the hydraulic conductivities in the catchment again measurements adapted for superficial soundings and complementary information on the catchment structure would enable qualitative and quantitative interpretations of the t 2 z values although mrs is an acknowledged method for estimating the hydraulic conductivity k legchenko et al 2004 mohnke and yaramanci 2008 we deliberately focused the exploration of parameters to the restricted set of aquifer thickness and porosity the direct computation of k from mrs is based on the mrs decay time distribution legchenko et al 2004 mohnke and yaramanci 2008 as stated above the quality of the data used in our study is not good enough for providing reliable estimates of the mrs decay time and thus of k another way to seek k could have been to add the parameter to the list of sought parameters to further reduce the mrs χ 2 while keeping a fair fit of the flow rate data however χ 2 values are already good and adding a sought parameter would have added under determination to the calibration of the hydrological model here again the acquisition of data with a higher signal to noise ratio and the use of complementary geophysical data are ideas to constrain k values 6 2 synthetic time lapse exploration as discussed above mrs data provide information constraining the calibration of the nihm model by checking the compatibility of the water content estimated by the hydrological model against the mrs measurements in turn the calibrated model helps reveal fruitful information on the locations where mrs measurements might monitor dynamic processes of water content fluctuations at the scale of a rain event or at a seasonal scale as an example nihm is run over the period extending from january 2013 to the end september 2013 and the simulated water content can be analyzed to check the sensitivity of mrs data to the water storage fluctuations we assume that no storage fluctuations occur in the weathered bedrock beneath the shallow modeled aquifer and we do not add the contribution of water in that layers in any case fixing a constant over time and positive water content value in the weathered bedrock would only generate a uniform shift of the mrs signal amplitude compared with the signal estimated when assuming that the weathered zone is dry the mrs signal errors used below correspond to those estimated from the measurements such errors give an insight into the mrs capacity to detect changes in water content a first focus analyzes the strong rain event that occurred between thejanuary 31 and february 10 2013 then a seasonal analysis is attempted by comparing the water content at the end of this rainy event with three snapshots separated by one month in the flow rate recession period of july to september 2013 conspicuously for an mrs station located along a hillslope station 4 figs 11 and 12 a d the rain event does not generate significant variations of the integrated mrs signal over time compared to the mrs error level in fact the steep slopes of the catchment are conducive to very rapid downward draining prohibiting large water storage along the hillslopes seasonal reductions of water inlets between winter and summer only induce a slight reduction of the water content in the deeper part of the aquifer fig 12 a the mrs signal should catch such variations because they span ranges slightly wider than the noise level fig 12 d that being said mrs measurements still need to be carried out in the winter right after a rain event to confirm or not the dynamic of such seasonal behaviors which are evidenced here by modeling only on the other hand a station located in zone 2 above the storage region and upward from the spring of the main stream station 22 fig 11 b e shows strong water content fluctuations within the short period of a rain event calculations for two days after any intense rainfall show a rise in subsurface water content producing mrs signal variations well above the mrs error level even better the mrs signal evolution over time is significant enough to monitor the water content dynamics with measurements acquired every second day as illustrated in fig 11 e seasonal fluctuations of the water content also generate a meaningful disparity in the mrs signal between winter and summer however we note that the drainage remains relatively fast meaning that during the summer recession period the mean water content fluctuations generate close mrs signals but are still distinguishable finally a station placed close to the outlet station 9 fig 11 c f in the small wetland zone along the stream is barely sensitive to water content variations related to a strong rain event however the mrs signal is more sensitive to seasonal fluctuations and even shows a significant decrease during the recession period fig 12 c f such simulations of mrs signals based on simulated water content in the subsurface have to be confirmed with repeated mrs measurements at the very least those types of calculations highlight the benefit of hydrogeological models to design relevant spatio temporal duplication of mrs experiments that are particularly cumbersome to set up 7 conclusions we show here the great potential of mrs data to constrain a hydrological model in the context of a two layer shallow aquifer with contrasted properties and thicknesses mrs data provide information directly sensitive to water content with no need for any petrophysical relationships thus the interpretation of the mrs signal is free of any perturbation related to observed lithological or mineralogical variations moreover the information contained in an mrs survey provides a powerful tool to locally constrain the hydraulic parameters while covering the whole catchment the methodology set up here requires neither calibration from core samples nor hydraulic tests as the water content estimated by the hydrological model is directly inserted to estimate the mrs signal compared to the measured one the capacity of mrs to monitor the dynamics of water content fluctuations is also suggested at the rain event and at the seasonal scale the synthetic tests performed underline that the locations of mrs stations should be strategically chosen beforehand because headwater catchments with steep slopes show highly varying water content dynamics with the location in the system for instance the mrs temporal variations might be null in some regions for example along the slopes or in the wetland by contrast flat areas located near upstream springs might be conducive to stronger hydrodynamic signals and subsequent significant mrs signal variations over time the acquisition of mrs data sets focusing on the first meters of the subsurface would allow for improving the methodology to delimit the variation ranges of the hydraulic parameter values and their probability density within a bayesian framework that being said specific protocols of acquisition have first to be settled to properly address the issues associated with the low signal to noise ratio of mrs measurements when sounding the shallow subsurface then the strategy employed in this study and post conditioning a hydrological model via mrs data could be inserted in a coupled inversion scheme by fitting the mrs signals to determine the hydrological model parameters at the scale of the catchment in this perspective the hydrological model nihm would probably be a suited tool because of its relative rapidity in simulating flow over the various compartments of a catchment however simulations are still too long for running the high number of models required by monte carlo approaches an adapted design of the inversion scheme is thus required and the use of the adjoint state in an inversion procedure of the descent type could become a first pioneering approach to the conditioning of an integrated hydrological model on the basis of mrs measurements together with stream flow rate data ackerer et al 2014 delay et al 2017 credit authorship contribution statement nolwenn lesparre conceptualization

5419,in headwater catchment the calibration of hydrological models is complex due to the scarcity of data in mountainous areas here an innovative methodology is developed to condition hydrological model parameters by using magnetic resonance sounding mrs measurements in combination with stream flow rate data mrs has the specificity in the various geophysical imaging techniques of being mainly sensitive to the vertical distribution of water content among the subsurface in a way very similar to hydraulic head observations these local distributions of water content may serve as information in a hydrological model to pattern subsurface flow by seeking model parameters simulations are run with different sets of parameters of a hydrological model each simulation provides as an output a 4 d map 3 d spatial plus time of the vertical water content distributions over the whole catchment and their fluctuations over time this output is then used to simulate the mrs signal that would be produced by the estimated water content the simulated mrs signal is compared to measured mrs data to determine which hydrological simulations which model parameters are close to observations the approach is applied on a hard rock headwater catchment housing a very shallow and thin aquifer where an mrs survey covers the whole studied site hydraulic parameters of an integrated hydrological model of the catchment are spatially distributed by zones with uniform values the prior delineation of the zones being guided by pedological studies as mrs measurements supply local but spatially distributed information the method conditions the various zones on their parameter values in a much better way than the classical in headwater catchments measure of the stream flow rate at the outlet of the system finally hydrological simulation and time dependent mrs forward calculations can help identifying possible locations for mrs stations to monitor the transient behavior of the hydrological state of the catchment keywords hydrological model parameters geophysics magnetic resonance sounding headwater catchment hard rock aquifer 1 introduction headwater catchments are widely used for water supply services and therefore represent essential reservoirs for water resources management winter 2007 blumstock et al 2016 the evolution of groundwater storage in such systems in response to climatic forcing is also of great importance as it controls the amount of water and elements released to the downstream part of rivers supports ecosystem services and strongly impacts the amplitude of streamflow during low flow and high flow periods rinderer et al 2014 blumstock et al 2016 water circulation in such environments is complex as it is shaped by the strong heterogeneity of the subsurface medium and lacks homogenization usually brought by large scale systems beven et al 1988 ameli et al 2016 chorover et al 2017 kim et al 2017 riebe et al 2017 dwivedi et al 2019 in the context of hard rock geology the spatial variability of the hydraulic properties from the superficial soils to the deeper bedrock substantially impacts the hydrological catchment response to rainfall

saprolite fractured bedrock and fresh bedrock might be of complex geometry influencing groundwater flow paths and the associated transit and residence times of water koch et al 2009 kosugi et al 2011 welch and allen 2014 gabrielli et al 2012 rempe and dietrich 2014 comte et al 2019 characterizing the heterogeneity of the hydraulic parameters in the subsurface and the geometry of the subsurface layers is still a challenge in hydrology salve et al 2012 koïta et al 2017 comte et al 2019 a proper characterization is nonetheless critical to reduce equifinality issues when using models that describe the water cycle at the catchment scale this is especially true for headwater catchments because these systems likely conceal a strong variability in terms of soil properties topographic interfaces and lithology indeed geochemical data analyses using tracer data highlighted the heterogeneity of the reservoirs supplying mountainous streams koch et al 2017 kim et al 2017 wymore et al 2017 modeling the streamflow at the outlet of a catchment was also shown to render non unique solutions due to the aggregated nature of the data convoluting the effects of various local behaviors and heterogeneities over the whole system ebel and loague 2006 calibrating a model by relying upon streamflow data only is known to be inefficient or at least highly uncertain the classical hydrogeological strategy that consists of fitting piezometric data from open boreholes remains arduous to set up in mountainous contexts where the field is hardly accessible to drilling works in addition piezometric data provide limited information regarding headwater catchments which means that only the local position of the water table is given when very shallow and thin aquifers would be better documented by measurements of the water content evolution with depth alternative strategies are needed to properly constrain hydrological models able to produce reliable simulations of the transient response of headwater catchments and thus improve our current understanding of streamflow generation processes in such environments weill et al 2019 the use of geophysical methods such as electrical resistivity seismic tomography or ground penetrating radar provides insights into the structure of subsurface systems and allows for defining zones of different properties including the thickness of hydraulically active layers koch et al 2009 befus et al 2011 cassidy et al 2014 holbrook et al 2014 parsekian et al 2015 soulsby et al 2016 olyphant et al 2016 orlando et al 2016 koïta et al 2017 flinchum et al 2018a time lapse experiments also inform on the processes driving the water circulation along hillslopes or in a catchment cassiani et al 2009 angermann et al 2017 jackisch et al 2017 scaini et al 2018 hübner et al 2017 kotikian et al 2019 in the first step the images of geophysical properties provide qualitative information on the subsurface structures or on the active dynamic processes in the second step petrophysical relationships allow a deeper interpretation of geophysical information by rendering a quantitative estimate of hydraulic parameters such as porosity tureson 2006 mota and monteiro santos 2010 holbrook et al 2014 rehman et al 2016 flinchum et al 2018b comte et al 2019 water content daily et al 1992 turesson 2006 mota and monteiro santos 2010 or sometimes hydraulic conductivity values chen et al 2001 slater 2007 léger et al 2014 gottschalk et al 2017 some developments of coupled inversions between geophysical data and hydrological models help to cope with the uncertainties stemming from deterministic inversions converting geophysical signals into images of the subsurface properties for example coupled inversions allow for by passing the effects of a degrading resolution of the geophysical image with depth or a smoothing effect related to the regularization applied to address the non unicity of the solutions hinnell et al 2010 binley et al 2015 however coupled inversions still require the use of empirically estimated petrophysical relationships whose application remains risky at a catchment scale in fact the petrophysical relationships may vary spatially as they rest on links between hydraulic and geophysical properties that are specific to a given site the scale investigated and the geological settings of the studied domain christensen et al 2016 magnetic resonance soundings mrs provide data that are directly sensitive to the subsurface water content without resorting to any variable petrophysical law legchenko et al 2004 costabel and günther 2014 the acquisition of such data is non invasive and supplies information concerning both the saturated and unsaturated zones of the subsurface mazzilli et al 2016 mrs measurements offer a direct estimate of the aquifer s free water content from which the effective porosity is deduced when the thickness of water bearing layers is provided by other data they also allow for evaluating indirectly the hydraulic conductivity via calibrations from pumping tests legchenko et al 2004 or sampling analysis mohnke and yaramanci 2008 an mrs survey performed on a network of stations strategically designed offers the opportunity to obtain direct insights on the spatial distribution of hydraulic variables at the catchment scale even if the system shows a strong spatial heterogeneity in terms of lithology or mineralogy furthermore mrs measurements integrate the subsurface water content over plugs depending on the geometry of the acquisition device but they are usually of a few tens of meters in lateral and vertical extension legchenko et al 2004 such sizes are comparable to the classical mesh resolution a few tens of m of hydrological models for small catchments 1 10 km2 thus more easily rendering the integration of mrs data into a modeling task to date most studies based on mrs data are devoted to systems where the thickness of the saprolite and the weathered bedrock are of a few tens of meters legchenko et al 2006 descloitres et al 2008 francés et al 2014 vouillamoz et al 2014 2015 koïta et al 2018 sites affected by ice age footprints show much thinner saprolite and weathered bedrock layers with thicknesses of a few meters due to intense erosion processes fichter et al 1998b sailhac et al 2009 comte et al 2019 despite the difficulty of probing the very shallow subsurface the combination of mrs data with other geophysical methods is very fruitful for revealing information on the saprolite and weathered rock hydraulic properties wyns et al 2004 baltassat et al 2005 sailhac et al 2009 comte et al 2019 in most of the previous studies reported by the literature mrs data are classically inverted to estimate the medium porosity and its hydraulic conductivity this information is later used as a prior guess in hydrological models at the hillslope or the catchment scale lubczynski and gurwin 2005 boucher et al 2012 comte et al 2019 nevertheless equifinality issues arise in the reconstruction process of the vertical distribution of water content and layer thicknesses that should condition the hydrological model costabel and günther 2014 this downside is emphasized when hydraulic conductivity estimates rest on empirical relationships that might spatially vary over the catchment nonetheless the coupling of mrs data with hydrogeological models is a powerful strategy to tackle non unicity issues as reported by a few studies to model pumping tests herckenrath et al 2012 vilhelmsen et al 2014 the capillary fringe costabel and günther 2014 the evaporation in the first centimeters of soils merz et al 2018 or the water movement in variably saturated media legchenko et al 2020 in this study an alternative methodology is proposed the idea is to turn upside down the classical formalism described previously and use mrs measurements as posterior information to constrain the subsurface parameters of the hydrological model instead of determining a prior spatial distribution of the hydraulic properties and the aquifer geometry from mrs the data are used as a calibration observation in the hydrological model as would be classical streamflow measurements or piezometric data the water content simulated by the hydrological model for a given set of model parameters is used to compute the resulting mrs signals that are then compared to the measured data the quality of fitting between mrs simulations and data then serves as the trigger to change in a monte carlo approach the set of hydrological parameters as a proof of concept this methodology is applied to the strengbach catchment a mountainous catchment belonging to the french network of critical zone observatories pierret et al 2018 the model used in the study is an integrated hydrological model i e a model that couples surface and subsurface flow processes called nihm normally integrated hydrological model pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 jeannot et al 2018 both streamflow and mrs data are employed to define a set of parameters allowing for describing both the hydrological response at the outlet and the local evolution of subsurface water content identified by mrs measurements the quality of the optimal set of parameters is then assessed using a long term streamflow chronicle the paper is organized as follows section 2 is dedicated to the presentation of the mrs method and the computation of mrs signals from water content estimates section 3 details the hydrological modeling strategy with emphasis on the assumptions that ground the nihm model and the way the water content is estimated in section 4 the field application of the proposed methodology is described the results are presented and discussed in the last section of the paper 2 mrs method 2 1 principle and implementation mrs is a geophysical method directly sensitive to the quantity of water molecules present in the subsurface mrs is conducted by recording the response of energized nuclei of hydrogen atoms only contained in water molecules in the absence of hydrocarbon to do so an alternating current is injected at fixed pulse moments and larmor frequency in wire loops of decametric size placed on the ground surface the pulse moment corresponds to the product of the injected current intensity by the pulse duration and the larmor frequency represents the precessing frequency of the hydrogen nuclear spins and depends on the local geomagnetic field legchenko and valla 2002 then the excited spins of the hydrogens nuclei are forced to tilt away from their equilibrium state after the energizing pulse is switched off spins relax back to their initial state the nuclei of hydrogen atoms reemit the accumulated energy producing an electromagnetic signal legchenko et al 2004 the same wire loops can be used to measure the temporal variation of the voltage induced by the electromagnetic response the recorded signal oscillates at larmor frequency and decays at a characteristic relaxation time t 2 z which depends on the pore space characteristics the mrs noise amplitude is generally evaluated by recording environmental noise over a duration similar to the mrs recording time with the same loop but before the mrs exciting pulse is emitted the overall measuring protocol described just above is called free induction decay fid in the specific cases where the subsurface medium has significant magnetic properties the fid signal can be perturbed but protocols called spin echo can be used by injecting a second electromagnetic pulse shushakov and fomenko 2004 legchenko et al 2010 grunewald et al 2014 the mrs measured signal is all the more sensitive to the deeper part of the subsurface that the loop is wider or the injected pulse is stronger the classical strategy is to fix the dimension of the loop such as it corresponds to the maximum sounded depth contemplated measurements are then repeated with different pulses of higher energy to progressively increase the depth sounded in the subsurface legchenko 2002 classically an inversion is then performed to reconstruct the vertical distribution of the water content θ z and the relaxation time t 2 z a higher subsurface water content induces a stronger amplitude of the measured signal with the consequence that media characterized by a very small water content are susceptible to show low signal to noise ratios most mrs equipment used for aquifer characterization is only sensitive to free water which can move under gravity driven forces but is not able to detect bound water as for example inter layer water molecules in clay minerals boucher et al 2011 large values of t 2 z indicate a coarse material while smaller values correspond to a fine grained material t 2 is related to the transversal relaxation time of the mrs signal t 2 by 1 t 2 1 t 2 μ δ b 0 2 where μ is the gyromagnetic ratio for protons and δ b 0 the magnetic gradient at the pore scale t 2 reflects directly the pore space characteristics because 1 t 2 ρ 2 s pore v pore kleinberg et al 1994 kenyon 1997 with ρ 2 being the surface relaxivity i e the property of the surface of the rocks to enhance relaxation and s pore and v pore corresponding to the inner surface and the volume of the pores respectively empirical but also more sophisticated models are able to link the mrs response of rocks to their permeability and saturation falzone and keating 2016 dlugosch et al 2013 however reliable values of t 2 are required for estimating the rock permeability or the pores characteristics vouillamoz et al 2012 2 2 mrs model assuming a vertical distribution of the water content θ z and a mono exponential relaxation characteristic time t 2 z the mrs envelop v q t decaying with time t for a pulse moment q can be written as legchenko and valla 2002 1 v q t z κ q z θ z exp t t 2 z dz the 1 d time invariant kernel function κ q z of the mrs vertical sensitivity is conditioned by the geomagnetic field amplitude and the larmor frequency the electrical resistivity distribution the geometry of the acquisition system i e the shape and the size of the injecting collecting wire loop the amplitude of the injected pulse current q the distribution of the subsurface layers in which θ z and t 2 z are provided the use of the mrs signal envelop integrated along the recording time is particularly relevant when the measured signal to noise ratio is weak because of a small water content or a strong environmental noise the signal to noise ratio of the integrated mrs signal is increased by averaging real and imaginary parts of the signal in the same envelope while avoiding vast loss of information from eq 1 the integrated signal a est q of the estimated mrs signal over time writes 2 a est q z k q z θ z t 2 z exp t s t 2 z exp t e t 2 z d z with t s the acquisition start time and t e the end of the acquisition time the fit quality between the estimated and measured mrs signals i e the objective function can then be expressed by comparing a est q with the measured signal area a mes q which error is estimated by the measured noise area a noise q a mes q and a noise q that are also integrated values over time are both computed using the trapezium rule on the raw measurements 2 3 mrs model parameterization in this study we propose to use mrs data as a posterior information to condition a hydrological model simulating water flows at the catchment scale the water content vertical distribution θ z at the locations of mrs station is supplied by one of the hydrological model outputs as described in the following section the fact remains that the vertical distribution of the variable t 2 z should be prescribed to solve eq 2 those values are determined via a simple least square technique we limited at two the number of sought t 2 z values to reduce equifinality issues associated with an excessive number of parameters to do so the raw mrs measurements are post processed by seeking for each pulse q the best model w q t for the envelope of the signal measured over time as 3 w q t a app q exp t t 2 app q where a app and t 2 app respectively correspond to the apparent amplitude and the apparent relaxation terms of the raw signal measured in the field examples of the estimation of a app and t 2 app to fit the signals acquired for the different pulses applied at the mrs stations are shown in lesparre et al submitted data also available at http hplus ore fr en lesparre et al 2020 joh data the aim of this fit is simply to get an insight on the t 2 med median t 2 app q values for each station t 2 med being used later as a prior estimate of the t 2 z that shapes the simulated mrs signal eq 2 assuming that t 2 z is relatively homogeneous over depth its prior value is set to t 2 med and its variation range is bounded by 0 2 t 2 med and 5 t 2 med the t 2 med estimated for the different stations are summarized in table 1 in lesparre et al submitted the t 2 med estimate is an apparent value which does not reflect the t 2 z of the subsurface therefore no interpretation is made on the t 2 med values 3 hydrological model 3 1 the normally integrated hydrological model nihm nihm is physically based and spatially distributed hydrological model to describe and couple the flow processes occurring in the surface and subsurface compartments of a catchment from local to regional scales pan et al 2015 weill et al 2017 jeannot et al 2018 the model describes flows in the subsurface in a 1 d stream network and over the 2 d land surface only 1 d routing via the stream network and subsurface flow are presented below since diffuse 2 d surface run off or exfiltration from the subsurface have never been evidenced at the strengbach catchment the absence of surface run off is associated with the presence of sandy soils that favor rapid infiltration pierret et al 2018 even over steep slopes that usually trigger run off nihm belongs to the so called simplified low dimensional models mainly because the full 3 d richards equation for flow in the subsurface is integrated along a direction perpendicular to the substratum with the idea to treat the subsurface compartment as a single two dimensional layer to this end flow within the 3 d subsurface domain is modeled through a 2 d equation while hydraulic parameters are defined in several layers the variation of the hydraulic parameters over depth is then taken into account when performing the flow integration perpendicularly to the substratum via mean integral parameters over the saturated and unsaturated thicknesses of the subsurface this technique drastically reduces the meshing effort the required memory space and the computational cost while preserving the physics especially for systems with a contrasted topography as in the strengbach catchment the description of flow in the 1 d stream network is based on a 1 d formulation of the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equations that neglects inertial effects over very short periods 100 s eventually occurring in surface routed flow the set of equations that are solved can be written as 4 θ i h t s h h t x y t θ x y h q w 5 l r h r t x k p x h r z r l r γ 1 d with θ i h z w z s θ z d z s h s s sat h t h θ k sat h z w z s k θ z d z k sat lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity tensor and s s sat l 1 is the specific storage capacity in the saturated zone both are averaged along the integration direction z l θ is the water content k lt 1 is the tensor of hydraulic conductivity h l is the hydraulic head or the capillary head in the subsurface q w lt 1 is a source sink term that accounts for both injection withdraw in the system and interactions with the 1 d river network and z w z s l are the local coordinates along the direction z normal to substratum of the water table and land surface respectively h r l is the water depth in the river network z r l is the elevation of the river bed l r l is the wetted width in the river k p l3t 1 is a conduction term that depends on geometrical parameters of the network the manning roughness coefficient and the surface water depth h r and γ 1 d lt 1 is a source sink term accounting for the stream network interactions with the subsurface for the application to the strengbach catchment we consider that the hydraulic conductivity tensors k and k sat are isotropic so they are reduced to the scalar values k and k sat respectively interactions coupling between the surface and subsurface compartments rely upon a first order approximation setting the exchanged water fluxes between the compartments as proportional to the head difference between the compartments the equations are solved together using a fully implicit approach and advanced numerical schemes a full description of the model and of the numerical techniques is available in jeannot et al 2018 various comparisons and bench tests weill et al 2017 jeannot et al 2018 showed that simplifications brought by nihm in the flow processes did not jeopardize accurate applications to complex hydrosystems jeannot et al 2019 3 2 water content estimate nihm calculates the water pressure expressed in height of fluid above a given elevation ψ l in each element of the catchment model and at each observation time from ψ the van genuchten 1980 equations can provide the vertical distribution of the water content θ z which is then used for the mrs signal estimates compared with observations for each hydrologic simulation nihm can supply outputs in the form of 4 d maps of water content 3 d spatial plus time as nihm is characterized by a two dimensional integrated subsurface compartment the three dimensional reconstruction of the water content in the subsurface needs a few explanations for the sake of simplicity but without loss of generality it is dealt hereafter with a horizontal aquifer where the vertical direction z is that of the normal to substratum direction of integration employed by nihm in nihm the hypothesis is that subsurface flow is mainly parallel to the substratum which implies that for darcian flow there will be an instantaneous hydrostatic equilibrium along the z direction with the hydraulic head gradient component h z 0 for an incompressible fluid at hydrostatic equilibrium and with very small fluid velocity i e neglecting kinetic energy of the fluid the bernoulli s theorem states that at any elevation z p above a prescribed reference between the substratum z b and the surface z s along the vertical direction z h ψ p z p where ψ p corresponds to the water pressure at the elevation z p the null gradient h z 0 assumes that h is uniform over z at the value of the saturated water table elevation z w therefore ψ p z w z p which renders positive values in the saturated zone z b z p z w and negative values in the unsaturated zone z w z p z s it is worth noting that nihm can calculate hydraulic heads h z w beneath the substratum z b in that case the aquifer is completely unsaturated along z but the calculation of ψ still applies in the same vein for hydraulic heads h z w above the surface z s the system is always saturated locally along the direction z exfiltration from the subsurface through the surface occurs and ψ is always positive along z knowing the values ψ z at any elevation z the van genuchten 1980 equations provide the vertical distribution of the water content in the form 6 θ z θ s θ r 1 α ψ z n m θ r if ψ 0 θ s if ψ 0 where θ is the effective saturation θ s is the saturated water content and θ r is the residual water content α is a parameter related to the mean pore size l 1 n is a parameter reflecting the uniformity of the pore size distribution and m is a parameter defined by m 1 1 n mualem 1976 the notation in eq 6 overlooks the eventual variability over the direction z of all parameters e g θ s z 4 overall methodology 4 1 workflow a flowchart

genuchten model 1980 5 assignment of the water contents θ z from a nihm simulation to the mrs forward model eq 2 and search of the relaxation times t 2 z by a least square fitting of the mrs simulated signals onto the mrs data 6 evaluation of the fit quality for both mrs simulated signals and nihm simulated flow rates with their equivalent in terms of observed data the steps 2 to 6 are inserted in a loop with the re assignment of the nihm parameters within the defined zones of the catchment until reaching fair fits of both mrs and flow rate data 4 2 fitting criteria for the calibration process nihm simulations are run over an eight month period from october 1 2012 to may 31 2013 the first four months are used to warm up the simulations rendering them independent of eventually flawed initial conditions while the remaining four months allow for the calibration of nihm with simulated mrs data and flow rate at the outlet compared with the corresponding observations the evaluation of the flow rate fit quality is computed using the kling gupta efficiency kge the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the root mean square error rmse criteria defined as 7 kge r 1 2 η 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the correlation coefficient between the simulated and observed discharges η is the ratio between the mean simulated and mean observed discharges and β is the ratio between the standard deviations of the simulated and observed discharges 8 nse 1 i 1 n q s t i q o t i 2 t 1 n q o t i q o 2 where q s t i and q o t i are respectively the simulated and observed discharge at time t i q o is the average of

populated with spruces mainly piceas abies l 80 and beeches fagus sylvatica l 20 the watershed covers approximately 0 8 km2 of surface area in which the elevation ranges between 883 and 1146 masl heavily incised slopes pattern the topography with an average slope of 15 but locally reaching up to 30 fig 2 two main hillsides compose the catchment displaying distinct meteorological and topographic parameters related to their respective orientation the south eastern hillside is mainly north exposed with weaker slopes and it is usually colder more humid and rainier than the south exposed north western hillside the bedrock of the catchment is mainly composed of hercynian granite poor in calcium 315 7millionyr micro granite and gneiss also outcrop locally along the southern and northern hillsides respectively el gh mari 1995 above the bedrock soils are approximately 1 m thick with a coarsely grained texture sandy and rich in gravel fichter et al 1998a the thickness of the granitic saprolite heavily weathered rock is estimated to vary between 1 and 9 m with a southern hillside presumably having a thicker weathered layer compared with the northern side el gh mari 1995 however the shallow subsurface of the northern hillside exhibits a higher macroporosity compared with the southern hillside a denser network of fissures fractures is indeed expected as granites on the northern slope have been altered by hydrothermal circulations that occurred 180 my ago fichter et al 1998b a delimitation of pedologic zones has been drawn from a structural study of the slope incision complemented by the analysis of 44 soil profiles covering the whole catchment and by field observations of geomorphological and geological features fig 2 acrisols cover the crests and the slopes of the catchment with podzols also present along the slopes colluviums cover the flat zone at the spring of the main stream while the area encompassing the stream outlet is covered by gleysoils i e a wetland soil almost permanently water saturated surrounding that gleysoil zone the soil is of ranker type narrow corridors of brown earths occur where the slopes are steep and the water saturation potential is high fig 2 5 2 hydrological and meteorological data the strengbach catchment has been monitored since 1986 by the observatoire hydro géochimique de l environnement ohge http ohge unistra fr cnrs university of strasbourg the hydro meteorological data sets collected during the last 30 years provide a unique material for studying the hydrological functioning of small mountainous headwater catchments pierret et al 2018 they allow for evaluating the impact of climate change on various hydrological and vegetation processes and discussing issues related to sustainability of water resources in forested mountainous environments beaulieu et al 2016 two meteorological stations one located on the northern crest and the other close to the stream outlet of the catchment monitor the rainfall temperature and relative humidity the upper station also monitors the global radiation wind speed and snow cover thickness seven additional rain gauges render information on the variability of the rainfall spatial distribution the average precipitation over the catchment is estimated from the value measured at the northern crest and then multiplied by a corrective factor determined by analyzing the relationships between the rain gauges spatially distributed over the catchment viville et al 1993 pierret et al 2019 the evapotranspiration is estimated as being the atmospheric demand evaluated by the penman formula 1948 an h flume continuously gauges the stream discharge at the outlet fig 2 other flumes are placed along the main stream or along secondary tributaries and are used to collect intermittent local data fortnightly among those the razs standing for ruisseau en amont de la zone saturée ie upstream the saturated zone flume monitored the discharge continuously during a few months for a temporary experiment in 1996 fig 2 nine boreholes were drilled in 2012 and 2013 with a depth varying between 15 and 120 m mainly for sampling rock cores these boreholes are deep enough to intercept a few fractures in the bedrock which renders the water levels monitored in these open boreholes unable to reflect hydraulic pressure heads in the active shallow porous aquifer of the catchment the local climate is of temperate oceanic mountainous type the analysis of ohge data in the 2007 2016 period shows a mean annual temperature of 6 c with mean monthly temperatures varying between 2 c and 14 5 c the average raw precipitation amounts to 1340 mm yr 1 intermittent snowfall occurs during two to four months in a year with inter annual variations from 1136 to 1594 mm yr 1 the mean annual potential evapotranspiration is estimated at 588 mm yr 1 with values ranging between 544 and 637 mm yr 1 the strengbach catchment collects different sources and streamlets and the mean flow rate at the outlet of the main stream is 666 mm yr 1 with inter annual variations between 584 and 904 mm yr 1 to close the water budget the volumes extracted for the water supply of the aubure village should also be accounted for as they represent approximately 14 of the total annual volume exiting the system by the stream this annual average withdraw for water supply is 92 mm yr 1 and varies between 72 and 133 mm yr 1 5 3 mrs measurements using the mono channel mrs system numisplus device from iris instruments we performed 32 mrs measurements two campaigns in april and may 2013 investigated 23 sites eight shaped loops were used as previous tests and showed the ability of such a geometry to reduce the ambient noise boucher et al 2015 the eight shaped loops were made of two squares each being of 37 5or 40 m on each side depending on the available cables thus the maximum sounded depth was of about 40 m and the information on the water content vertical distribution collected in the datasets was expected to be relatively coarse indeed no information was available about the groundwater circulation at the time the mrs measurements were carried out therefore the strategy was simply to record soundings able to provide an overall information on the water content distribution with noises measured before the acquisition and not synchronously interpretation methods using remote but synchronous noise measurements were inapplicable dalgaard et al 2012 however eight shaped loops with 200 to 300 stacks were used and some recent tests in the field with a multi channel mrs system did not show any improvement thus the eight shaped loop strategy remained the most efficient in this specific catchment compared with filtering based on remote noise measurements acquisition protocols corresponding to either free induction decay fid or spin echo se signals were collected depending on the station indeed the occurrence of magnetic minerals associated with past hydrothermal activity on the northern slope allowed some se recordings in this part nevertheless we decided to use only fid signals in this study because of their higher amplitude and their availability at all mrs stations finally only 16data sets stations were kept covering fairly well the southern part of the catchment while only a few stations remained useful on the northern hillside fig 3 in addition for the selected data sets only measurements performed with the weaker injected pulses q 2000 a ms were kept because the signals of higher pulse moments were not sensitive enough to the shallow distribution of the water content data processing was done with the samovar 11x4 software a package developed at the institut de recherche pour le développement ird france as mentioned in section 2 the measured signal was strongly affected by environmental noise mainly because the mrs signal amplitude was weak with a maximum amplitude of about 50nv for our study site characteristics after a time out of 40 ms the acquisitions were recorded with a sampling rate of 2 ms last between 205 and 466 ms however to compute a mes q we applied the time integration only over the first 162 ms after the time out of the recording because the final measurements showed strong fluctuations due to the exponential decrease of the signal that was rapidly vanishing over time and much more sensitive to the ambient noises at long acquisition times a previous analysis of the mrs measurements rendered a qualitative depiction of the subsurface water volume distribution in the catchment boucher et al 2015 pierret et al 2018 the map of the water volume concealed in the weathered layer of the system shows some variability strongly correlated with the pedologic zonation fig 2 the gneissic and clayed rock materials of the northern crest might prohibit the detection of subsurface water by mrs measurements boucher et al 2015 on the northern hillside the shallow subsurface is made of fissured fractured granites altered by intense past hydrothermal circulations there the estimated water volume is intermediate and might feed perennial flow overtime boucher et al 2015 the southern hillside which is less altered fichter et al 1998b shows smaller water content with a drier vadose zone less prone to infiltration finally the water content is higher underneath the wetland in the downstream part of the catchment and under the flat colluvium zone which would be the thickest porous subarea of the catchment boucher et al 2015 5 4 parameters set up given the catchment characteristics in this study the 2 d mesh used for the subsurface flow computation in nihm is refined close to the streams to model accurately the surface and subsurface coupling fig 3 the mesh is also refined close to the mrs stations to provide accurate information on the subsurface water content distribution the 2 d mesh is made of 10 249 triangular elements delineated between 5260 nodes the 1 d stream network is extended upward to the actual stream path to form the water routing associated with the logging roads since they behave intermittently as brooks the 1 d mesh is drawn by 828 segments joining 821 nodes specifically for the application to the strengbach catchment nihm was parameterized by following a delineation in zones derived from the pedological map figs 2 and 3 hydraulic parameters within each zone are uniform and the characteristics of these zones are reported in table1 the acrisols of weathered slopes that present similar pedologic characteristics in orange in fig 2 are distinguished according to their location on either the northern or the southern hillsides of the catchment indeed those two hillsides are distinguished in terms of thickness and porosity of aquifer layers because of their different level of alteration fichter et al 1998b the regions corresponding to the narrow corridors of brown earth in green in fig 2 are overlooked the water content is extracted from the nihm 3 d maps in the vicinity of each mrs station at the time the mrs data were acquired the water content values are extracted inside a vertical cylinder of 40 m diameter centered on each mrs station then the water content are averaged to build a 1 d model of water content θ z varying with the depth z below ground level from this θ z model the mrs signal is computed as described in section 2 before being compared with field measurements the exploration of the mrs data sensitivity was limited to two main parameters of nihm the aquifer thickness normal to the topographic surface and the porosity which is considered as equivalent to the saturated water content θ s several exploratory calculations were performed to estimate the volume of the aquifer required to simulate the outlet flow rate dynamic of this very reactive catchment for example a thin single layer aquifer with a uniform porosity of 8 is able to reproduce the outlet flow rate fairly well the thickness of the single layer can vary over space between 2 and 8 m and more than 20 single layer models evenly fit the outlet flow rate with a kge 0 88 a nse 0 87 and a rmse 6 96 l s 1 these examples illustrate the equifinality issue encountered when only the outlet flow rate is available by contrast the single layer models fail to correctly reproduce the mrs data in particular station 22 shows a χ 2 10 irrespective of the parameter values when representing the subsurface with a single layer fig 4 a the mrs measurements are in fact very sensitive to the contrast in water content between a thin one meter or so very superficial strongly altered zone of soil and beneath a deeper layer showing a porosity strongly decreasing with depth corresponding to the saprolite thus in each zone of the catchment we sought the thickness and the porosity for a two layer model as depicted in fig 5 the superficial layer represents the soil that might be relatively thin but with higher porosity than the underlying saprolite susceptible to be thicker but with smaller porosity fig 5 this type of geometry for the shallow subsurface has often been evoked in other mountainous hard rock sites befus et al 2011 holbrook et al 2014 2019 orlando et al 2016 flinchum et al 2018a the other parameters of nihm reported in table 2 were prescribed as uniform values over the whole catchment except for the k sat parameter all the other parameters in table2 do not have a strong effect on the model outputs the values of α and n parameters in the van genuchten model are chosen close to that discussed in a hydrological modeling inter comparison performed by maxwell et al 2014 the k sat value is fixed to limit the space of parameters to explore as already mentioned nihm outputs render an estimate of the water content in all the active layers constituting the aquifer from the surface to the bedrock however some water could be present below the soil and saprolite layers the active aquifer of the catchment inducing a signal recorded in the mrs raw data for example water in the weathered bedrock could be detected by mrs even if this water contributes to neither the very transient superficial hydrology nor the stream flow rate with this in mind we choose to allow some degree of freedom to the fit of mrs data by considering the eventual existence of water content in various layers beneath the shallow aquifer modeled by nihm the bottom limit of this deeper medium is set to 30 m below the ground surface and the deeper medium is divided into 6 layers between the bottom of the nihm aquifer and the lower limit fig 5 θ z in the threeshallower layers of the weathered bedrock might range between 0 and 0 005 while the threedeeper layers θ z might range between 0 and 0 03 the first three layers in the weathered bedrock with very small water content help both the mrs estimates and the hydrological modeling to clearly delineate the interface between the active shallow aquifer and the weathered bedrock the three deeper layers in the weathered bedrock with higher but still small water content help to retrieve water concealed in depth as evidenced by the first analysis of the mrs datasets boucher et al 2015 as nihm only provides estimates of the water content θ z in the shallow aquifer the values of θ z in the six underlying bedrock layers are unknown those values are sought during the least square inversion in the step 5 of the workflow that also looks for two values of t 2 z one assigned to the shallow aquifer modeled by nihm and the other to the six layers of the weathered bedrock fig 5 mrs data reflect the state of local water content in the subsurface but for systems flowing rapidly such as the hillslopes of the catchment this local state might also depend on the water circulation in regions located upward and downward from the acquisition point in other words the water locally stored beneath the mrs stations depends on the hydraulic properties of the upward and downward regions as an example stations 5 and 9 are shown to be sensitive to the hydrodynamic parameters of the zones located upward therefore when seeking the model parameters in nihm to fit mrs data the search is first carried out for the contributing regions represented by the crests and the upper parts of the hillsides then the parameters are explored downward toward the valley draining the whole catchment this procedure is intended to progressively fit the whole mrs data set together with the outlet flow rate of the stream in the valley 6 results and discussion 6 1 hydrogeophysical data fit an example of the set of parameters fairly well fitting the mrs data and the outlet flow is given in table3 presently no complementary geophysical data are available to validate this set of parameters loggings from six boreholes confirm the observed tendency of a soil thickness relatively homogeneous around 1 m while the saprolite thickness is more susceptible to vary with higher values in zone 2 other sets of parameters with values close to those presented in table 3 could also reproduce this data set however an mrs data set with a reduced noise level and a higher sensitivity to the shallow medium is required to perform a quantitative study of the parameters set confidence interval as discussed below the resulting porosity values might seem low in both the soil and saprolite layers sometimes with values as low as 0 1 in the soil and 0 02 in the saprolite table 3 it is worth noting that they correspond to an average value of the porosity in each layer moreover they reflect the effective porosity since the hydrological model only takes into account the porosity that enables water circulation this is consistent with the mrs signal that is mostly influenced by the water contained in the effective porosity the quality of fitting between data and simulations is reported for each mrs station 0 5 χ 2 2 5 fig 4b and for the outlet flow rate kge 0 86 rmse 6 08 l s 1 nse 0 91 fig 6 a longer period is shown in fig 6 compared to the one used for calibration tests of nihm february 1 2013 to may 31 2013 the idea is to show the forcing variations until the beginning of september 2013 because it is also discussed below of synthetic tests conducted to estimate the mrs signal until that date simulations with the same set of parameters were also run a over a few months during spring 1996 when the stream flow rate was also monitored continuously at the razs station fig 3 and b between the beginning of september 2008 and the end of august 2016 such simulations show a fair agreement with field flow rate measurements as a kge value of 0 7 is estimated at razs and at the outlet for the 1996 period for the 2008 2016 simulation the kge is 0 84 the porous space available for subsurface flow circulation corresponding to the selected set of parameters is illustrated in fig 7 mapping the porous volume in the subsurface per unit of surface area of the aquifer this quantity is simply estimated by multiplying the thicknesses of the subsurface layers by their corresponding porosity θ s the state of the water content at the date of the first mrs acquisition the 12th of april 2013 is mapped in fig 8 the water volume at that time is strongly patterned by the porous space available fig 7 the boundaries of the zones dividing the catchment fig 3 are emphasized by strong variations of the concealed water volume because of the abrupt variations of the aquifer thicknesses zone 2 which is located upstream from the main springs shows a high water volume despite its lower porous space compared with zones 1 and 3 this observation can be explained by its small slope allowing the area to better store water than an area of steep slopes where water flows rapidly under gravity driven forces a disparity is observed between the northern and southern slopes of the catchment as witnessed by zones 4 and 5 despite their similar available porous space the southern slope zone4 shows a slightly higher water volume here again this can be explained by the steeper slopes of zone5 that favor downward drainage the water content estimated by nihm beneath each mrs station is strongly patterned by the zone in which the station is located fig 9 all mrs stations within a given zone respond similarly in terms of the water content modeled by nihm with the exception of station 8 which appears as an outlier in zone 4 close to the boundaries of zones 2 3 and 4 except for stations 9 and 14 fitting the whole mrs data set requires the presence of water in depth in the weathered bedrock to reproduce the measurements fig 9 although the inversion lacks constraints to quantitatively evaluate the corresponding amount of water present in depth we infer the presence of water in the weathered bedrock beneath the active shallow aquifer it should be noted that deep water is not necessary to reproduce the amplitude and the variability of the outlet flow rate the mrs data are in general explained by nihm simulations fig 4b and 10 and despite the low water content and the noise level the method provides constraints on the nihm parameters for example two layers with contrasting thickness and porosity must compose the shallow aquifer to reproduce the mrs signal together with the outlet flow rate mrs data also provide an insight into the spatial distribution of parameters thanks to the local but spatially distributed nature of the measurements now it has been confirmed that the active aquifer is very superficial another set up of mrs measurements could be useful to improve the parameter estimates it is noteworthy that mrs data in the form they have been collected are of limited resolution in the shallow subsurface in the absence of hydrological modeling when mrs data were collected in 2013 the medium was sounded over several tens of meters in depth as is classically performed for a first acquisition in unconstrained aquifers synchronous noise measurements using a remote loop could also help to reduce the noise level dalgaard et al 2012 finally mrs data are not free from equifinality issues when seeking the porosity and the thickness of the watered layers thus complementary information about the aquifer thickness and porosity are required to better constrain these parameters the knowledge of the subsurface seismic velocity variations at the scale of the catchment could help in constraining the porosity distribution and hence the aquifer thickness diversity flinchum et al 2018b similarly we did not attempt to interpret the t 2 z values obtained in this study see table 2 in lesparre et al submitted as it is very likely that they might be non unique therefore we do not consider that the various estimated values t 2 z could also reflect the spatial variations of the hydraulic conductivities in the catchment again measurements adapted for superficial soundings and complementary information on the catchment structure would enable qualitative and quantitative interpretations of the t 2 z values although mrs is an acknowledged method for estimating the hydraulic conductivity k legchenko et al 2004 mohnke and yaramanci 2008 we deliberately focused the exploration of parameters to the restricted set of aquifer thickness and porosity the direct computation of k from mrs is based on the mrs decay time distribution legchenko et al 2004 mohnke and yaramanci 2008 as stated above the quality of the data used in our study is not good enough for providing reliable estimates of the mrs decay time and thus of k another way to seek k could have been to add the parameter to the list of sought parameters to further reduce the mrs χ 2 while keeping a fair fit of the flow rate data however χ 2 values are already good and adding a sought parameter would have added under determination to the calibration of the hydrological model here again the acquisition of data with a higher signal to noise ratio and the use of complementary geophysical data are ideas to constrain k values 6 2 synthetic time lapse exploration as discussed above mrs data provide information constraining the calibration of the nihm model by checking the compatibility of the water content estimated by the hydrological model against the mrs measurements in turn the calibrated model helps reveal fruitful information on the locations where mrs measurements might monitor dynamic processes of water content fluctuations at the scale of a rain event or at a seasonal scale as an example nihm is run over the period extending from january 2013 to the end september 2013 and the simulated water content can be analyzed to check the sensitivity of mrs data to the water storage fluctuations we assume that no storage fluctuations occur in the weathered bedrock beneath the shallow modeled aquifer and we do not add the contribution of water in that layers in any case fixing a constant over time and positive water content value in the weathered bedrock would only generate a uniform shift of the mrs signal amplitude compared with the signal estimated when assuming that the weathered zone is dry the mrs signal errors used below correspond to those estimated from the measurements such errors give an insight into the mrs capacity to detect changes in water content a first focus analyzes the strong rain event that occurred between thejanuary 31 and february 10 2013 then a seasonal analysis is attempted by comparing the water content at the end of this rainy event with three snapshots separated by one month in the flow rate recession period of july to september 2013 conspicuously for an mrs station located along a hillslope station 4 figs 11 and 12 a d the rain event does not generate significant variations of the integrated mrs signal over time compared to the mrs error level in fact the steep slopes of the catchment are conducive to very rapid downward draining prohibiting large water storage along the hillslopes seasonal reductions of water inlets between winter and summer only induce a slight reduction of the water content in the deeper part of the aquifer fig 12 a the mrs signal should catch such variations because they span ranges slightly wider than the noise level fig 12 d that being said mrs measurements still need to be carried out in the winter right after a rain event to confirm or not the dynamic of such seasonal behaviors which are evidenced here by modeling only on the other hand a station located in zone 2 above the storage region and upward from the spring of the main stream station 22 fig 11 b e shows strong water content fluctuations within the short period of a rain event calculations for two days after any intense rainfall show a rise in subsurface water content producing mrs signal variations well above the mrs error level even better the mrs signal evolution over time is significant enough to monitor the water content dynamics with measurements acquired every second day as illustrated in fig 11 e seasonal fluctuations of the water content also generate a meaningful disparity in the mrs signal between winter and summer however we note that the drainage remains relatively fast meaning that during the summer recession period the mean water content fluctuations generate close mrs signals but are still distinguishable finally a station placed close to the outlet station 9 fig 11 c f in the small wetland zone along the stream is barely sensitive to water content variations related to a strong rain event however the mrs signal is more sensitive to seasonal fluctuations and even shows a significant decrease during the recession period fig 12 c f such simulations of mrs signals based on simulated water content in the subsurface have to be confirmed with repeated mrs measurements at the very least those types of calculations highlight the benefit of hydrogeological models to design relevant spatio temporal duplication of mrs experiments that are particularly cumbersome to set up 7 conclusions we show here the great potential of mrs data to constrain a hydrological model in the context of a two layer shallow aquifer with contrasted properties and thicknesses mrs data provide information directly sensitive to water content with no need for any petrophysical relationships thus the interpretation of the mrs signal is free of any perturbation related to observed lithological or mineralogical variations moreover the information contained in an mrs survey provides a powerful tool to locally constrain the hydraulic parameters while covering the whole catchment the methodology set up here requires neither calibration from core samples nor hydraulic tests as the water content estimated by the hydrological model is directly inserted to estimate the mrs signal compared to the measured one the capacity of mrs to monitor the dynamics of water content fluctuations is also suggested at the rain event and at the seasonal scale the synthetic tests performed underline that the locations of mrs stations should be strategically chosen beforehand because headwater catchments with steep slopes show highly varying water content dynamics with the location in the system for instance the mrs temporal variations might be null in some regions for example along the slopes or in the wetland by contrast flat areas located near upstream springs might be conducive to stronger hydrodynamic signals and subsequent significant mrs signal variations over time the acquisition of mrs data sets focusing on the first meters of the subsurface would allow for improving the methodology to delimit the variation ranges of the hydraulic parameter values and their probability density within a bayesian framework that being said specific protocols of acquisition have first to be settled to properly address the issues associated with the low signal to noise ratio of mrs measurements when sounding the shallow subsurface then the strategy employed in this study and post conditioning a hydrological model via mrs data could be inserted in a coupled inversion scheme by fitting the mrs signals to determine the hydrological model parameters at the scale of the catchment in this perspective the hydrological model nihm would probably be a suited tool because of its relative rapidity in simulating flow over the various compartments of a catchment however simulations are still too long for running the high number of models required by monte carlo approaches an adapted design of the inversion scheme is thus required and the use of the adjoint state in an inversion procedure of the descent type could become a first pioneering approach to the conditioning of an integrated hydrological model on the basis of mrs measurements together with stream flow rate data ackerer et al 2014 delay et al 2017 credit authorship contribution statement nolwenn lesparre conceptualization
