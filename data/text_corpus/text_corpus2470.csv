12350,the physio chemical properties of water play an important role on the efficiency of a process selection of materials and the lifetime of conduits used to carry the fluid used either in industries or for irrigation a study was undertaken to assess the quality of groundwaters in the dholera geothermal field the groundwater samples were collected from shallow geothermal wells located at different places in dholera district samples were collected from nine geothermal wells and tested for ph total dissolved salts tds na k ca 2 mg 2 f hco3 cl and so4 2 and their distribution was observed using spatial distribution contours piper plot ternary plot and various other diagrams were used to analyse the water for manifold direct and indirect uses from the results it was concluded that even though the water cannot be used for irrigation purpose various utilization strategies focusing on exploitation methods for geothermal energy revolving around industrial applications agriculture and space heating and cooling and power generation by geothermal resources have been devised for geothermal water of dholera region in this paper graphical abstract fx1 abbreviations dmic

developed as a smart city under the delhi mumbai industrial corridor dmic project with the aim of developing dholera as a smart city the industrial activity is connoted to triple over the next five years spurting the demand for water one of the most basic necessities for any industry to flourish moreover demand of electric power is implied to skyrocket dholera is one of the most water scarce areas in gujarat with just 260 m3 surface water resources per capita state environmental report 2016 the surface water comes from four west flowing rivers namely sukhbhadar lilka bhogavo and keri which flow into the gulf of khambhat and transverse through the dsir area fig 2 however neither of the mentioned rivers are perennial i e they remain dry for about nine months of the year nor do they provide significant supply and are full of silt the current water needs of dholera like that of most of gujarat are satiated by water supply from the narmada canal the water demand for the proposed dsir will be 947 million litres per day mld out of which residential and industrial water demand will be 298 and 491 mld respectively a portion of this industrial grade water is proposed to be procured from treated waste water by ahmedabad municipal corporation amc and water from narmada canal is proposed to fulfill the irrigation water demand for the dsir building a canal to dholera requires a lot of investment about rs 4500 crore 694 million dollars officials have made it clear that water for industrial and domestic use for dholera sir is not available and all of the narmada water has already been allocated to other areas of gujarat with the problem of scarce surface water resources and limited freshwater supply from the narmada canal need arises for exploitation of groundwater found in aquifers lying below the surface in this region by doing so salty groundwaters of dholera region may be used as a proxy for fresh water thus resulting in lower consumption of fresh water for applications where salty water can be used dsir 2013 alongside increased water demand electricity demand will inflate the requirement in residential industrial recreational sports entertainment strategic infrastructure roads public facility zones and tourism purposes the power demand for the smart city to be developed at dholera is calculated to be around 750 mw srivastava et al 2015 and the decision of utilizing renewable energy for the production of the same seems to be the better option dholera sits over a low enthalpy geothermal reservoir which is characterized by high gravity reading and presence of many hot water wells and geothermal hot water springs shah et al 2017 this could be utilized in a number of ways in industries and other purposes the most important of which is through the use of gshp systems for geothermal space heating and cooling vaidya et al 2015 which would decrease electricity demand another avenue for exploitation includes producing electric power using organic rankine cycle sircar et al 2017 thus it becomes necessary to investigate water chemistry and distribution of various ions and trace metals in and around dholera region for determining if it can be discreetly utilized without any ill effects to the health of consumers or equipments using water this was the impetus behind selecting dholera for studying the geochemistry of water and devising the strategies for exploitation this paper has furthermore analyzed the suitability for the use of groundwater for irrigational purpose aquaculture and various other direct applications wilcox diagram piper plot spatial distribution of various ions and trace elements and scatter analysis have been employed to characterise the water moreover multivariate statistical analysis such as cluster analysis and dendrogram interpretation has also been carried out to better understand the water quality it allowed the identification of possible factors that influence water system and offered valuable inputs for reliable management of water resources as well as instant solution to pollution problems vega et al 1998 lee et al 2001 adams et al 2001 wunderlin et al 2001 reghunath et al 2002 simeonov et al 2003 shrestha and kazama 2006 in present study multivariate statistical analysis has been applied to characterize and evaluate groundwater quality for potential applications helena et al 2000 singh et al 2004 2005 2 methods 2 1 study area the present study area is located in the ahmedabad district of gujarat state the dholera geothermal field an ancient port city in the gulf of khambhat fig 1 lies 30 km south west of the dhandhuka village in the ahmedabad district and is around 60 km to the north of the city of bhavnagar dholera is in proximity to the coast it is surrounded by water faces on three sides namely on the east face by gulf of khambhat on the north side by bavaliari creek and on the southern side by sonaria creek aghil et al 2014 the dholera special investment region dsir will be a major new industrial hub located on a greenfield site about 100 km south of ahmedabad and about 130 km from gandhinagar the project is the first investment region to be designated under the proposed delhi mumbai industrial corridor project dmic a joint indian and japanese government initiative to create a linear zone of industrial development nodes along a dedicated freight corridor dfc shah et al 2018 dholera thermal springs are located along the margin of saurashtra peninsula and lie in the vicinity of western marginal fault of cambay basin as shown in fig 1 the saurashtra peninsula is one of the three conspicuous physiographic divisions of the gujarat state and lies between 20 30 n to 22 30 n latitude and 69 00 e to 72 30 e longitude the saurashtra peninsula is located along the north western margin of the indian shield occurs as a horst block between the three intersecting rift namely kachchh cambay and narmada biswas 1987 cambay basin rests on the deccan trap which lies at a depth of 500 600 m quaternary alluvial deposits of a thickness up to 100 m occur by the side of the basin sircar et al 2015 villages here show an easterly trend in elevation changes wherein the low lying plain falls gradually from the 8 m contour on the western boundary to 4 m in the east the area is marked by the presence of old mud flats flood plains and salt flat areas the soil in this region mainly consists of alternate layers of gravels fine to coarse grained sand and clay chemically the soil is loamy mixed montmorillonitic calcareous and mostly saline the subsurface lithology of the area is mostly sand dominant consisting of alternating layers of coarse and fine sand 2 2 field investigations sampling and analyses field investigation and groundwater sampling were carried out on 9 bore wells these wells had depths ranging from 200 m to 280 m and were fully screened the aquifers from which water samples were taken were in quaternary alluvial deposits and not in the crystalline rock the terrain profile of the study area is flat and low lying and is in the delta region of five rivers namely sukhbhadar lilka utavali padaliyo and keri geologically the area occupies quaternary soils deposited in the subsiding area adjacent to the cambay basin of a thickness of about 100 m over the tertiary sediments resting on deccan traps at a depth of about 500 600 m the general slope of the ground is from the west to the east in the investigation area the study area falls under the western basin margin fault of the cambay basin the geomorphology shows most of the area with the presence of salt and old mud flats with saline ground water levels representative water samples from the drilled wells were collected for the laboratory analysis there were three samples collected from each water source raw untreated sample for determination of ph and conductivity filtered untreated sample for determining anionic concentrations an acidified sample with nitric acid reduced to ph 2 for determination of cationic concentrations samples from all the 9 wells were collected after pumping out for 15 min to prevent non representative sample and polluted water the parameter such as temperature electric conductivity ec and ph were measured in the field immediately after sampling using a multiparameter series meter preservation of samples was critical in order to reduce the rate of any biological or chemical reactions the bottles were rinsed using groundwater to be sampled and were stored in the acid washed bottles also the samples were filtered on site using a acetate cellulose filter paper having pore size of 0 45 µm after collecting the samples these were evaluated in our laboratory where all the chemical analyses were carried out in order to obtain concentration values standard apha methods were used to determine the concentration of chloride sulphate fluoride calcium magnesium hco3 boron arsenic iron magnesium silica lead and nickle apha et al 2012 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms has been used for the analysis of strontium caesium rubidium barium to determine the sodium and potassium content flame photometric and edta method was used armijo 2012 2 3 understanding the hydrogeochemical processes hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater can also be indicative of its origin and history of the migration path of the meteoric water groundwater contains dissolved minerals from the soil layers through which it is passed the water bodies are continuously subjected to a dynamic state of change with respect to lithological characteristics and geo climatic conditions the chemical characteristics of the water results from hydro geochemical processes of precipitations of solids minerals reduction and oxidation compounds solutions or evolution of gases sorption or ion exchange and mixing of different waters assessment of the hydro chemical characteristics of water and aquifer hydraulic properties is important for groundwater planning and management in the study area generally the movement of groundwater along its migration paths in the subsurface increases the concentration of the chemical species domenico and schwartz 1998 freeze and cherry 1979 as we know that the criteria used to characterize water for a particular purpose using a particular plot would not suffice in explaining the suitability of the standard for other uses hence in order to obtain better results only combined chemistry of all the ions rather than individual or paired ionic character is considered therefore methods proposed by piper gibbs stiff etc have been used in this paper to understand the water chemistry of dholera geothermal system furthermore the analytical data were imported into the arcgis software and ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighted technique was used for interpolation and mapping chang 2012 adnan and iqbal 2014 the techniques provide an unbiased prediction with minimum variance and interpolation errors munna et al 2015 such values can be mapped to generate error surfaces which inform about the reliability of the estimation 3 results and interpretation 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics figs 3 and 4 show the spatial distribution of physico chemical parameters such as ph tds ec na cl ca2 mg2 f k and hco3 ph usually has no direct impact on consumers it is one of the most important operational water quality parameter with the optimum ph required often being in the range of 6 5 9 5 who world health organization 2004 who 2011 total dissolved solids tds is a parameter related to electrical conductivity the significance of ec and tds lies in their impact on the corrosivity potential of a groundwater samples and in their impact on the solvency of somewhat dissolvable compounds for example caco3 fig 3 show the spatial distribution for values of tds cl na and ec from the spatial distribution diagrams of na cl ec and tds it can clearly be deduced that distribution of ec is in consequence of na and cl concentrations moreover the spread of tds is also in consequence of na and cl thus na and cl are the ions dominating among salts constituting total dissolved salt amount the salinity hazard is one of the most important parameters that can be harmful for crop fertility ec can be considered as the salinity hazard based on ayers and westcott 1985 groundwater can be classified as excellent if ec values are less than 700 µmho cm and good if the ec ranges between 700 and 3000 µmho cm if ec exceeds 3000 µmho cm it will be harmful for crop productivity as fig 3 c indicates all sampes of this study can be termed as harmful for irrigation values of ec ranges mostly from 6200 to 8000 µmho cm and values of na and cl ions ranges from 1100 to 1500 mg l and 2400 3000 mg l respectively fig 3 a and b spatial distribution shows all places with higher concentration which could be dangerous for irrigation and industrial purposes the high chloride may be attributed to industrial domestic wastes leaching from upper soil layers in dry climates and natural geochemical activities in the area tds values of groundwater for drinking water should lie between acceptable to permissible limit 500 2000 mg l average tds value in the study area is approximately 4200 mg l fig 3 d high tds values can be attributed to the intrusion of sea water from the gulf of khambhat which is very near to study area as shown in fig 1 furthermore this may be attributed to waterlogging conditions prevailing in this region due to physiographic depression goyal et al 2006 excessive amount of tds affects the plants and soil texture as higher salt concentration in irrigation water will create more osmotic pressure outside not allowing the water to reach the leaves and stems of plants selvam et al 2013 high level of tds may be aesthetically unsatisfactory for domestic purpose fig 4 a shows the spatial distribution of ph of groundwater in the area of study the ph value of drinking water is an important parameter that determines whether the water is acidic or alkaline in nature a number of minerals and organic matter interact with each other resulting in increase or decrease of ph values tiwari et al 2017 the ph of water samples ranges from 6 6 to 7 3 with average of about 7 1 water is of neutral nature potassium ions are ranging from 21 to 75 mg l with an average of 31 mg l fig 4 b bicarbonates shows variation from 140 to 190 mg l with an average of 165 mg l fig 4 c bicarbonates over 100 mg l are sufficient enough to cause concern and that near or above 200 mg l may pose potential hazards as higher carbonates causes calcium to precipitate resulting in comparative increase in sodium ion concentration carbonate concentration in the study area is too high for drinking and irrigation purpose until processed fig 4 d shows distribution of magnesium ion concentration which varies from 45 to 310 mg l with average of 150 mg l the maximum permissible limit for mg2 ions as per indian standards is 100 mg l for drinking purposes making water unhealthy for drinking unless processed water with this concentration of magnesium is not likely to pose any problem for industrial use or direct use of water fig 4 e is showing distribution of fluoride ion which ranges from 0 07 to 1 16 mg l with most of the samples falling in the range of desired limit of fluoride concentration i e 1 0 mg l flourid is known to be beneficial to human health if taken in limited quantity permissible limit is 1 5 mg l for using water in drinking purpose calcium ion concentration varies in between 100 and 300 mg l fig 4 f permissible limit for ca2 ion in water for drinking is 200 mg l but desired limit is 75 mg l so considering the concentration of calcium ions also it is not desirable to use in drinking purposes who 2004 2011 from the point of view for industrial usage permissible limit of ca2 in water for industry use is 500 mg l as per indian standards making no issues for water to be used in industrial purposes if striped bass trout salmon or red drum culture is being considered free calcium concentrations in the 40 100 mg l range 100 250 mg l as caco3 hardness are more desirable table 1 compares the limits for the parameters of water to be used in industries as per indian standards with the parameters of the water sample collected from study area except tds and clevery parameter falls within the permissible limit 3 2 water quality characterization 3 2 1 hydrochemical facies graphical representation of groundwater major dissolved constituents major cations and major anions helps in understanding its hydrochemical evolution grouping and areal distribution in the present study piper trilinear diagram stiff diagram and gibbs plot were constructed to evaluate variation in hydrochemical facies piper plots are the graphical representation of relative abundance of cations and anions individually and also the combined representation as a whole of major cations and anions piper 1994 plot has been used to understand the hydrogeochemistry of the water and process involved with it the facies are a function of lithology solution kinetics and flow patterns of the aquifer and recognizable parts of different characters belonging to any genetically related system the relationship between different water bodies and processes influencing their chemical composition was investigated through the use of major ion concentrations versus cl concentration because chlorine is the good indicator for mixing phenomena along the groundwater flowpath it comes in contact with various materials and other fluids which affect its quality this water quality depends upon various factors such as topography nature of bedrock soil atmosphere and air precipitation ravikumar et al 2015 the ternary plot at bottom left of piper plot shows relative abundance of cations sodium calcium magnesium and potassium in this case hydrogeochemical facies such as ca 2 mg 2 cl so4 2 can help us to understand the chemical character of water ravikumar et al 2015 the plot clearly shows how the samples are rich in na and k high na concentration in water samples could pose major problem in the form of corrosion in pipes bottom right ternary plot of piper plot shows relative proportions of anions so4 2 sulphur fluoride and co3 2 in our case water is rich in chloride as compared to other anions however from both ternary diagrams it is inferred that water is high in na and cl the compositional change has been found to be similar as the cation exchange reactions that take place when saltwater intrusion occurs jeen et al 2001 richter and kreitler 1993 most of the groundwater samples indicated a chemical composition dominated by sodium and chloride ions which usually specifies a strong seawater influence pulido leboeuf 2004 chidambaram et al 2017 fig 5 the stiff diagram is also used for investigation of cations and anion dominance at different locations sample wise composition is also shown by stif diagram which is in common cations and anions with concentration represented in electrical equivalents cations are represented on the left side and anions are displayed on the right side of the middle axis stiff 1951 from the stiff diagram it is evident that all the samples have high salinity mean ec 6670 μs cm fig 6 the concentration orders observed for cations and anions are na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 f the cation composition is dominated by na and ca2 while the anionic composition varies from dominantly cl to hco3 and so4 2 according to gibbs 1970 rivers may have an assemblage of dissolved loads that reflect dominant effects of precipitation rock weathering or evaporation in dry regions all water samples from different wells are mainly located on the upper right of the diagram with na na ca2 ratio greater than 0 7 and high tds between 1260 and 5676 mg l which showed that the groundwater chemistry was not only controlled by rock weathering and or rainwater composition but almost by mixing of saline water or evaporation crystallization the grey shaded area as proposed by gibbs 1970 reflects rock weathering dominance rwd values below the shaded area were proposed to represent atmospheric precipitation dominance apd and tds values above the shaded area are dominated by evaporation crystallization dominance ecd fig 7 a 3 2 2 suitability for irrigation wilcox s diagram is adopted for the classification of geothermal water for local irrigation wherein the ec is plotted against na wilcox 1948 for irrigation purposes u s salinity laboratory has classified water on the basis of ec and na concentration into five different categories as shown in fig 7 d according to wilcox diagram relating sodium percentage and total concentrations indicates that sampes from the study area are unsuitable for irrigation simeonova et al 2003 the agricultural yields are generally very low in the lands irrigated the water of unsuitable category due tothe presence of excess sodium salts this causes osmotic effects on soil plant system high salinity problems are encountered where irrigation activity is in poor drainage agricultural soils and also where water logging allows the water table to rise close to the root zone of plants causing accumulation of sodium salts in the soil solution through capillary rise following surface evaporation liu et al 2012 high amount of unwanted cations can destroy the soil structure due to the de flocculation dispersion of clay particles process hosseinifard and aminiyan 2015 according to the sodium concentration and specific conductance the suitability of the water samples varies from doubtful region to non suitable region fig 7 d only one of the samples falls in the doubtful region but water from all well stations is not conventionally useable for irrigation thus this can be utilized for other applications like fish farming and farming of salinity tolerant potatoes yaycili and alikamanoğlu 2012 from wilcox analysis it is evident that gw2 well is showing behaviour contrasting from other wells the reason for which might be its location in the vicinity of lake bhim talav which causes flushing of groundwater by fresh water consequently diluting the ionic concentration and thus reducing the salinity the series plot verifies this fact and so it is inferred that it can be developed because of low ec and relatively low cation abundance fig 7 b the sodium adsorption ratio sar is a dimensionless parameter used to evaluate the sodium hazard in relation to calcium and magnesium concentrations sappa et al 2014 this parameter is used as an index to evaluate groundwater suitability for the irrigation purposes in the study area ayers and westcot 1994 shaki and adeloye 2006 thus the suitability of the hot water springs and groundwater samples was evaluated by calculating the sar using the following equation richards 1954 1 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 there is a significant relationship between sodium adsorption ratio of irrigation water and the extent to which sodium is absorbed by the soils nishanthiny et al 2010 if water used for irrigation is high in sodium and low in calcium content then exchangeable calcium in soil may replace sodium by base exchange reaction in water nagaraju et al 2016 this can destroy the soil structure owing to dispersion of the clay particles the sar values in the study area range from 22 5 to 32 with an average of 30 none of the water samples show an sar below the value of 12 fig 7 c thus the fact that the groundwater from study area is not suitable for irrigation purpose has been verified again kelly 1951 had suggested that the sodium problem in irrigation water could be very conveniently identified on the basis of the values of kelly s ratio kelley 1963 suggested that kr for irrigation water should not exceed one kr 1 the kelly s ration of more than one demonstrates an abundance of sodium in groundwater ravikumar et al 2011 kurdi and eslamkish 2017 also based on the equation depletion of ca or mg can lead to an excess level of kelly s index hence waters with a kelly s index more than 1 are unsuitable kelly s ratio is calculated for our study area which ranges from 1 3 to 7 5 table 6 the locations in the study area that have the value of kelly s ratio greater than 1 are unfit for irrigation kelly 1963 2 kr na ca 2 mg 2 3 2 3 impact of water quality for industrial applications in direct or indirect geothermal applications there is gradual reduction in temperature this results in simultaneously decreasing salt solubility which leads to formation of scales on the inner wall of equipment used scale is less conductive so this decreases the heat flux through the walls of equipment leading to decrease in efficiency and overheating ultimately leading to failure of equipment krishnamurthy et al 2014 thus geochemical analysis helps in taking precaution regarding scale formation issue this has to be kept in mind while selecting material for different parts of orc like condenser vaporizer and turbine according to working temperature and pressure conditions selecting the material to be used is a very critical task especially for turbine body and different sections like for transition section column pipe diffuser bowl inlet bell impeller shaft shaft sleeve and wear rings bolting 3 3 hydrodynamic model the following paragraph illustrates the fluid flow model postulated for the present study one of the most important elements of a geothermal reservoir is the cap rock which prevents cold ground water from invading into the high temperature reservoir at depths shallower than 200 m clay altered minerals may be present they are formed at temperature ranging approximately 55 60 c during the drilling of the shallow exploratory wells and such lithologies were detected in the drill cores therefore it is considered that the formation at depths shallower than 400 m acts as a cap rock for the geothermal system that exist in dholera as the clay alterations can be considered impermeable fig 8 depicts that the parental fluid ascends through the high permeable zones developed along the faults which characterize this region the high resistivity rock exists at the deep sub surface while the geothermal source exists in deep regions with manifestations at shallow depths due to circulation aided by convection cells we postulate that both are connected through fault systems certain confidences in these models are provided by the results from the acquired mt survey results sahajpal et al 2015 the main direction of movement at the central section of the acquired profiles appears to be vertical with very limited lateral movement the faults identified are normal in nature the ascending hot fluid yields convective circulation systems beneath the cap rock the fluid reaching shallower part may be from a two phase or vapour dominated reservoir furthermore meteoric water from the recharge area descends through sub vertical channels such as permeable faults or sub vertical intrusive body contacts to a deep heat exchange high temperature zone the resulting mixing converts the meteoric water to high temperature nacl enriched parent geothermal fluid through heat and chemical exchange basically the parent geothermal fluid of geothermal systems has two components meteoric water and magmatic fluid deep level magmatic fluid contributes contents like hcl hf so2 h2o h2s gases which convert to dominant nacl form due to interaction with the host rocks in the subsurface these fluids may in part become trapped below brittle plastic boundaries of intrusions in the form of quartz poly phase nacl inclusions the fluids then ascend through high permeability zones geothermal reservoirs and finally discharge at the earth surface in the form of hot springs flows from recharge to discharge areas are driven by pressure and fluid density differences forced and free convection kiryukhin et al 2002 4 statistical analysis 4 1 bivariate plots the bivariate plots reveal considerable variability in the relationships among different hydrogeochemical parameters at the nine different sites bhattacharya et al 2009 on the bivariate plot of na normalized ca2 versus na normalized hco3 and mg2 fig 9 groundwater samples falls in between the region of evaporite dissolution and silicate weathering evaporites are the rock formed as precipitates by evaporation of saline water evaporites mostly contain halite anhydrite and gypsum thus high na ion concentration in ground water of studied area might be result of dissolution of evaporites combined with mixing of sea water or evaporites are mainly constituted of halites i e nacl biswas et al 2012 by plotting bivariate plots for hco3 and so4 2 corrected ca2 and mg2 to remove the effect of ca2 and mg2 from carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering against cl corrected na to exclude effect of evaporite dissolution fig 10 a aquifer with active cation exchange between na and ca2 and mg2 will show the slope of line equal to 1 i e y x but the slope of best fit linear equation of studied water samples gives slope of 0 1 which shows the water chemistry is not significantly controlled by cation exchange moreover if the water is entirely from meteoric origin ratio of cl to na should be 1 i e the samples should fall on y x line of cl versus na plot but from both the plots it can be seen that water samples are enriched in cl with cl to na ratio greater than 1 for all samples fig 10 b enrichment of cl ion in groundwater might be result of dissolution of chloride containing mineral like chlorapatite or the source may be anthropogenic origin like agricultural and domestic waste water fertilizers water from septic tanks etc bhattacharya et al 2006 4 2 multivariate analyses multivariate statistical techniques have been extensively used to facilitate the solution of environmental problems and suggest evidence for the understanding of some natural and anthropogenic processes selvakumar et al 2017 correlation analysis ca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca have been broadly used as unbiased methods in the analysis of water quality data for drawing meaningful information box et al 1978 chapman 1996 shrivastava and patil 2002 singh et al 2005 pearson s correlation matrices pearson 1896 were used to find relationships between two or more variables and two sets of data bajpayee et al 2012 it is a simplified statistical tool to show the degree of dependency of one variable to another the correlation coefficients of various water quality parameters were calculated and the values of the correlation coefficients are given in table 3 the pearson correlation coefficient is rxy is calculated by using the formula as given patil and patil 2010 jothivenkatachalam et al 2010 kumar and sinha 2010 based on the value of pearson coefficient r the correlation between two parameters plotted on a xy scatter diagram can be termed as a positive or negative das and nag 2015 according to the pearson s correlation samples showing r 0 7 are considered to be strongly correlated whereas r in the range of 0 45 0 7 shows moderate correlation at a significance level strong positive correlations exist between cl and na r 0 98 cl and k r 0 90 and ca2 and mg2 r 0 9812 also tds has a statistically positive correlation with ec r 0 9808 and had a negative correlation with ph r 0 2851 at 0 05 levels ec has positive correlation with tds na k and cl ec indicates that these ions tend to increase in concentration as the salinity of the water increases the salinization of the groundwater can be expected to result from the ionic concentrations increasing due to both evaporation of recharge water and to the effects of interactions between the groundwater and the geological formations everitt et al 2011 in this statistical analysis many correlations are found to be moderate to weak which might be owing to sea water intrusion from the gulf of khambhat and so its direct use for drinking and irrigation is not possible in correlation matrices table dark green and red coloured boxed indicate good correlations while the light coloured boxes represent that weak to moderate correlation is present shanmugasundharam et al 2017 4 3 dendrogram hca hierarchical cluster analysis analysis or dendrogram representation is used for grouping water samples by similar monitoring sites in their chemical composition the multiple water quality parameters can be clustered based on their dependency routroy et al 2013 the sampling locations can be clustered based on chemical similarity in samples collected from various sites in the study area singh et al 2005 shreshtha and kazama 2006 dendrograms are the pictorial representation techniques which classify data with high homogeneity within the cluster group and heterogeneity between the different clusters horizontal axis shows the dissimilarity or improper correlation in the group of data the clusters linked at height near to zero have a strong correlation or the variation of inthe data is less than the other clusters at comparatively more height as these diagrams help to link the properties or the set of properties of particular entity they are also referred to as linkage diagrams in the present study water samples have been collected from the dholera geothermal field and the dendrograms are prepared for water quality parameters fig 11 a and sampling locations fig 11 b fig 11 a shows the dendrogram linking the properties measured in the water from nine wells from the diagram it is inferred that variation in values of f and ph k and so4 2 and ca2 and mg2 are compatible with each other while the variation in the values of na cl tds and ec is comparatively much more than the variation in values of former one standard deviation of all parameters in different wells are as shown in table 2 as the concentration of f ph k so4 2 hco3 ca2 and mg2 are not found varying in the area of study so it can also be estimated to be the same for any future exploitation of groundwater in this area the major concern lies with the values of salinity owing to fluctuation of tds and ec also thus tests for salinity must be carried prior to any use and accordingly measures should be taken this also implies the variation in subsurface geology as intrusion of sea water is not same over the area resulting in high variation of na and cl fig 11 b is the dendrogram linking the wells on the basis of their properties it can be deduced that well u1 and u4 shows good linkage as do wells gw1 and gw4 while there is high variation in measured properties of water from well gw2 as compared to other wells this variation also pertains to the subsurface geology thus the linkage diagram or dendrogram helps in associating areas with similar water properties 5 water quality indices 5 1 langelier saturation index lsi langelier saturation index lsi index is the indicator for capability of water to dissolve or to precipitate the carbonates langlier 1936 lsi is basically difference in ph measured and ph at saturation with respect to calcium carbonate at particular temperature calculations for the same are as follows lsi ph phs langlier 1936 phs 9 3 a b c d where a log10 tds 1 10 0 15 b 13 12 log10 c 273 34 55 c log10 ca2 as caco3 0 4 d log10 alkalinity as caco3 it is also worth that the lsi is temperature sensitive the lsi becomes more positive as the water temperature increases this increase in temperature can cause scaling especially in cases such as geothermal waters haritash et al 2016 lsi of water samples of study area shows that as water is undersaturated with respect to concentration of calcium carbonate so it has tendency to dissolve the scales if already present from viewpoint of scale deposition water quality will not pose a problem of scaling but on contrary it will increase the direct contact of water with metal which increases or enhances corrosion based on the material of the pipe and other ions present in water the same is the case with study area water has no potential for scale formation but it could lead to high corrosion rates table 6 the interpretation of lsi index has been show in tables 4 and 5 6 results and discussions from gibbs classification piper plot stiff diagrams and wilcox plot values of na cl tds and ec are found exceptionally high from cluster analysis i e dendrogram representation and pearson correlation these parameters are the only ones found varying over the region the values of the other parameters do not deviate too much but the values pose a major concern in the use of water for drinking and irrigation purposes high tds values can be attributed to sea water from gulf of khambhat which is very near to study area as shown in fig 1 the salt concentration is too high to be used for irrigation or drinking purposes but to use it for any other direct applications like geothermal hvac or orc it must be treated so as to bring the salt concentration down to the level at which problems of salt water corrosion in the pipelines may be cut down this quality of water can find its use in flushing of toilets or can be used for seawater fish farming moreover saline water has found great use in cooling of thermoelectric power equipments and also in mining considering dholera area in particular it falls under the delhi mumbai industrial corridor fig 1 thus use of saline water from subsurface may provide the benefits of providing power by means of geothermal energy by orc and space heating and cooling system on commercial and industrial basis and also can satisfy the need of water for industries decreasing dependencies on fresh water from piper plot also it is clearly been deduced that water is rich in salts and majorly due to na and cl ions thus the need is to focus on effects and measures to be taken so as to control the concentration of na and cl higher tds leads to foaming in boilers and scale deposition excess chloride content is likely to increase corrosion rate of steel and aluminium solution to this can be use of copper galvanized steel and cast iron pipes attributing their property to high resistance to salt water corrosion but exposure over time can still cause damage thus before planning the strategies for exploitation of groundwater at dholera for industrial purpose care for controlling tds especially na and cl ions has to be taken into account surface facilities for hvac or orc by using geothermal groundwater should be designed with grade of pipes in accordance with high cl concentration water can find its great utility if desalinated at or near well before circulating through pipelines sea water fish cultivation can find its development with prevailing quality of water thus the use of groundwater of such quality for industrial purpose power generation by hot geothermal water space heating and cooling plants fish culture and water for flushing in toilets for mining will result in less dependency on fresh water 7 conclusion water quality analysis is helpful in assessment and management of water quality for various direct and indirect geothermal applications the present investigation represents the first of its type undertaken on the dholera geothermal region gujarat groundwater qualities of dholera region was studied and assessed accordingly the groundwater samples were collected from different wells located at different areas in dholera region the physical and chemical properties were evaluated to investigate geothermal water quality for direct applications and irrigation the parameters like sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage were calculated from the chemical data as per the results obtained sar and na revealed unsuitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes also based on the lsi results it can be concluded that the groundwater in this area is not suitable for industrial applications as well high na and cl concentrations ultimately result in high tds and high ec the spatial distribution of hydrochemical parameters such as tds content ec cl na and mg2 suggests seawater intrusion in the aquifer from gulf of khambhat these obtained parameters would be useful during designing and selection of material for industrial applications most of the water sample exceeds the maximum permissible limit of who standards this implies that the groundwater in dholera region cannot be utilized for drinking and irrigation purposes however the water can be utilized for irrigation and industrial applications after necessary processes such as primary and secondary treatments such as desalination as dholera is a geothermal field geothermal power can be generated in the region and subsequently supplied to the desalination activities this research will be beneficial during the upcoming large scale commercial projects under delhi mumbai industrial corridor dmic acknowledgements

developed as a smart city under the delhi mumbai industrial corridor dmic project with the aim of developing dholera as a smart city the industrial activity is connoted to triple over the next five years spurting the demand for water one of the most basic necessities for any industry to flourish moreover demand of electric power is implied to skyrocket dholera is one of the most water scarce areas in gujarat with just 260 m3 surface water resources per capita state environmental report 2016 the surface water comes from four west flowing rivers namely sukhbhadar lilka bhogavo and keri which flow into the gulf of khambhat and transverse through the dsir area fig 2 however neither of the mentioned rivers are perennial i e they remain dry for about nine months of the year nor do they provide significant supply and are full of silt the current water needs of dholera like that of most of gujarat are satiated by water supply from the narmada canal the water demand for the proposed dsir will be 947 million litres per day mld out of which residential and industrial water demand will be 298 and 491 mld respectively a portion of this industrial grade water is proposed to be procured from treated waste water by ahmedabad municipal corporation amc and water from narmada canal is proposed to fulfill the irrigation water demand for the dsir building a canal to dholera requires a lot of investment about rs 4500 crore 694 million dollars officials have made it clear that water for industrial and domestic use for dholera sir is not available and all of the narmada water has already been allocated to other areas of gujarat with the problem of scarce surface water resources and limited freshwater supply from the narmada canal need arises for exploitation of groundwater found in aquifers lying below the surface in this region by doing so salty groundwaters of dholera region may be used as a proxy for fresh water thus resulting in lower consumption of fresh water for applications where salty water can be used dsir 2013 alongside increased water demand electricity demand will inflate the requirement in residential industrial recreational sports entertainment strategic infrastructure roads public facility zones and tourism purposes the power demand for the smart city to be developed at dholera is calculated to be around 750 mw srivastava et al 2015 and the decision of utilizing renewable energy for the production of the same seems to be the better option dholera sits over a low enthalpy geothermal reservoir which is characterized by high gravity reading and presence of many hot water wells and geothermal hot water springs shah et al 2017 this could be utilized in a number of ways in industries and other purposes the most important of which is through the use of gshp systems for geothermal space heating and cooling vaidya et al 2015 which would decrease electricity demand another avenue for exploitation includes producing electric power using organic rankine cycle sircar et al 2017 thus it becomes necessary to investigate water chemistry and distribution of various ions and trace metals in and around dholera region for determining if it can be discreetly utilized without any ill effects to the health of consumers or equipments using water this was the impetus behind selecting dholera for studying the geochemistry of water and devising the strategies for exploitation this paper has furthermore analyzed the suitability for the use of groundwater for irrigational purpose aquaculture and various other direct applications wilcox diagram piper plot spatial distribution of various ions and trace elements and scatter analysis have been employed to characterise the water moreover multivariate statistical analysis such as cluster analysis and dendrogram interpretation has also been carried out to better understand the water quality it allowed the identification of possible factors that influence water system and offered valuable inputs for reliable management of water resources as well as instant solution to pollution problems vega et al 1998 lee et al 2001 adams et al 2001 wunderlin et al 2001 reghunath et al 2002 simeonov et al 2003 shrestha and kazama 2006 in present study multivariate statistical analysis has been applied to characterize and evaluate groundwater quality for potential applications helena et al 2000 singh et al 2004 2005 2 methods 2 1 study area the present study area is located in the ahmedabad district of gujarat state the dholera geothermal field an ancient port city in the gulf of khambhat fig 1 lies 30 km south west of the dhandhuka village in the ahmedabad district and is around 60 km to the north of the city of bhavnagar dholera is in proximity to the coast it is surrounded by water faces on three sides namely on the east face by gulf of khambhat on the north side by bavaliari creek and on the southern side by sonaria creek aghil et al 2014 the dholera special investment region dsir will be a major new industrial hub located on a greenfield site about 100 km south of ahmedabad and about 130 km from gandhinagar the project is the first investment region to be designated under the proposed delhi mumbai industrial corridor project dmic a joint indian and japanese government initiative to create a linear zone of industrial development nodes along a dedicated freight corridor dfc shah et al 2018 dholera thermal springs are located along the margin of saurashtra peninsula and lie in the vicinity of western marginal fault of cambay basin as shown in fig 1 the saurashtra peninsula is one of the three conspicuous physiographic divisions of the gujarat state and lies between 20 30 n to 22 30 n latitude and 69 00 e to 72 30 e longitude the saurashtra peninsula is located along the north western margin of the indian shield occurs as a horst block between the three intersecting rift namely kachchh cambay and narmada biswas 1987 cambay basin rests on the deccan trap which lies at a depth of 500 600 m quaternary alluvial deposits of a thickness up to 100 m occur by the side of the basin sircar et al 2015 villages here show an easterly trend in elevation changes wherein the low lying plain falls gradually from the 8 m contour on the western boundary to 4 m in the east the area is marked by the presence of old mud flats flood plains and salt flat areas the soil in this region mainly consists of alternate layers of gravels fine to coarse grained sand and clay chemically the soil is loamy mixed montmorillonitic calcareous and mostly saline the subsurface lithology of the area is mostly sand dominant consisting of alternating layers of coarse and fine sand 2 2 field investigations sampling and analyses field investigation and groundwater sampling were carried out on 9 bore wells these wells had depths ranging from 200 m to 280 m and were fully screened the aquifers from which water samples were taken were in quaternary alluvial deposits and not in the crystalline rock the terrain profile of the study area is flat and low lying and is in the delta region of five rivers namely sukhbhadar lilka utavali padaliyo and keri geologically the area occupies quaternary soils deposited in the subsiding area adjacent to the cambay basin of a thickness of about 100 m over the tertiary sediments resting on deccan traps at a depth of about 500 600 m the general slope of the ground is from the west to the east in the investigation area the study area falls under the western basin margin fault of the cambay basin the geomorphology shows most of the area with the presence of salt and old mud flats with saline ground water levels representative water samples from the drilled wells were collected for the laboratory analysis there were three samples collected from each water source raw untreated sample for determination of ph and conductivity filtered untreated sample for determining anionic concentrations an acidified sample with nitric acid reduced to ph 2 for determination of cationic concentrations samples from all the 9 wells were collected after pumping out for 15 min to prevent non representative sample and polluted water the parameter such as temperature electric conductivity ec and ph were measured in the field immediately after sampling using a multiparameter series meter preservation of samples was critical in order to reduce the rate of any biological or chemical reactions the bottles were rinsed using groundwater to be sampled and were stored in the acid washed bottles also the samples were filtered on site using a acetate cellulose filter paper having pore size of 0 45 µm after collecting the samples these were evaluated in our laboratory where all the chemical analyses were carried out in order to obtain concentration values standard apha methods were used to determine the concentration of chloride sulphate fluoride calcium magnesium hco3 boron arsenic iron magnesium silica lead and nickle apha et al 2012 inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy icp ms has been used for the analysis of strontium caesium rubidium barium to determine the sodium and potassium content flame photometric and edta method was used armijo 2012 2 3 understanding the hydrogeochemical processes hydrogeochemical composition of groundwater can also be indicative of its origin and history of the migration path of the meteoric water groundwater contains dissolved minerals from the soil layers through which it is passed the water bodies are continuously subjected to a dynamic state of change with respect to lithological characteristics and geo climatic conditions the chemical characteristics of the water results from hydro geochemical processes of precipitations of solids minerals reduction and oxidation compounds solutions or evolution of gases sorption or ion exchange and mixing of different waters assessment of the hydro chemical characteristics of water and aquifer hydraulic properties is important for groundwater planning and management in the study area generally the movement of groundwater along its migration paths in the subsurface increases the concentration of the chemical species domenico and schwartz 1998 freeze and cherry 1979 as we know that the criteria used to characterize water for a particular purpose using a particular plot would not suffice in explaining the suitability of the standard for other uses hence in order to obtain better results only combined chemistry of all the ions rather than individual or paired ionic character is considered therefore methods proposed by piper gibbs stiff etc have been used in this paper to understand the water chemistry of dholera geothermal system furthermore the analytical data were imported into the arcgis software and ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighted technique was used for interpolation and mapping chang 2012 adnan and iqbal 2014 the techniques provide an unbiased prediction with minimum variance and interpolation errors munna et al 2015 such values can be mapped to generate error surfaces which inform about the reliability of the estimation 3 results and interpretation 3 1 hydrochemical characteristics figs 3 and 4 show the spatial distribution of physico chemical parameters such as ph tds ec na cl ca2 mg2 f k and hco3 ph usually has no direct impact on consumers it is one of the most important operational water quality parameter with the optimum ph required often being in the range of 6 5 9 5 who world health organization 2004 who 2011 total dissolved solids tds is a parameter related to electrical conductivity the significance of ec and tds lies in their impact on the corrosivity potential of a groundwater samples and in their impact on the solvency of somewhat dissolvable compounds for example caco3 fig 3 show the spatial distribution for values of tds cl na and ec from the spatial distribution diagrams of na cl ec and tds it can clearly be deduced that distribution of ec is in consequence of na and cl concentrations moreover the spread of tds is also in consequence of na and cl thus na and cl are the ions dominating among salts constituting total dissolved salt amount the salinity hazard is one of the most important parameters that can be harmful for crop fertility ec can be considered as the salinity hazard based on ayers and westcott 1985 groundwater can be classified as excellent if ec values are less than 700 µmho cm and good if the ec ranges between 700 and 3000 µmho cm if ec exceeds 3000 µmho cm it will be harmful for crop productivity as fig 3 c indicates all sampes of this study can be termed as harmful for irrigation values of ec ranges mostly from 6200 to 8000 µmho cm and values of na and cl ions ranges from 1100 to 1500 mg l and 2400 3000 mg l respectively fig 3 a and b spatial distribution shows all places with higher concentration which could be dangerous for irrigation and industrial purposes the high chloride may be attributed to industrial domestic wastes leaching from upper soil layers in dry climates and natural geochemical activities in the area tds values of groundwater for drinking water should lie between acceptable to permissible limit 500 2000 mg l average tds value in the study area is approximately 4200 mg l fig 3 d high tds values can be attributed to the intrusion of sea water from the gulf of khambhat which is very near to study area as shown in fig 1 furthermore this may be attributed to waterlogging conditions prevailing in this region due to physiographic depression goyal et al 2006 excessive amount of tds affects the plants and soil texture as higher salt concentration in irrigation water will create more osmotic pressure outside not allowing the water to reach the leaves and stems of plants selvam et al 2013 high level of tds may be aesthetically unsatisfactory for domestic purpose fig 4 a shows the spatial distribution of ph of groundwater in the area of study the ph value of drinking water is an important parameter that determines whether the water is acidic or alkaline in nature a number of minerals and organic matter interact with each other resulting in increase or decrease of ph values tiwari et al 2017 the ph of water samples ranges from 6 6 to 7 3 with average of about 7 1 water is of neutral nature potassium ions are ranging from 21 to 75 mg l with an average of 31 mg l fig 4 b bicarbonates shows variation from 140 to 190 mg l with an average of 165 mg l fig 4 c bicarbonates over 100 mg l are sufficient enough to cause concern and that near or above 200 mg l may pose potential hazards as higher carbonates causes calcium to precipitate resulting in comparative increase in sodium ion concentration carbonate concentration in the study area is too high for drinking and irrigation purpose until processed fig 4 d shows distribution of magnesium ion concentration which varies from 45 to 310 mg l with average of 150 mg l the maximum permissible limit for mg2 ions as per indian standards is 100 mg l for drinking purposes making water unhealthy for drinking unless processed water with this concentration of magnesium is not likely to pose any problem for industrial use or direct use of water fig 4 e is showing distribution of fluoride ion which ranges from 0 07 to 1 16 mg l with most of the samples falling in the range of desired limit of fluoride concentration i e 1 0 mg l flourid is known to be beneficial to human health if taken in limited quantity permissible limit is 1 5 mg l for using water in drinking purpose calcium ion concentration varies in between 100 and 300 mg l fig 4 f permissible limit for ca2 ion in water for drinking is 200 mg l but desired limit is 75 mg l so considering the concentration of calcium ions also it is not desirable to use in drinking purposes who 2004 2011 from the point of view for industrial usage permissible limit of ca2 in water for industry use is 500 mg l as per indian standards making no issues for water to be used in industrial purposes if striped bass trout salmon or red drum culture is being considered free calcium concentrations in the 40 100 mg l range 100 250 mg l as caco3 hardness are more desirable table 1 compares the limits for the parameters of water to be used in industries as per indian standards with the parameters of the water sample collected from study area except tds and clevery parameter falls within the permissible limit 3 2 water quality characterization 3 2 1 hydrochemical facies graphical representation of groundwater major dissolved constituents major cations and major anions helps in understanding its hydrochemical evolution grouping and areal distribution in the present study piper trilinear diagram stiff diagram and gibbs plot were constructed to evaluate variation in hydrochemical facies piper plots are the graphical representation of relative abundance of cations and anions individually and also the combined representation as a whole of major cations and anions piper 1994 plot has been used to understand the hydrogeochemistry of the water and process involved with it the facies are a function of lithology solution kinetics and flow patterns of the aquifer and recognizable parts of different characters belonging to any genetically related system the relationship between different water bodies and processes influencing their chemical composition was investigated through the use of major ion concentrations versus cl concentration because chlorine is the good indicator for mixing phenomena along the groundwater flowpath it comes in contact with various materials and other fluids which affect its quality this water quality depends upon various factors such as topography nature of bedrock soil atmosphere and air precipitation ravikumar et al 2015 the ternary plot at bottom left of piper plot shows relative abundance of cations sodium calcium magnesium and potassium in this case hydrogeochemical facies such as ca 2 mg 2 cl so4 2 can help us to understand the chemical character of water ravikumar et al 2015 the plot clearly shows how the samples are rich in na and k high na concentration in water samples could pose major problem in the form of corrosion in pipes bottom right ternary plot of piper plot shows relative proportions of anions so4 2 sulphur fluoride and co3 2 in our case water is rich in chloride as compared to other anions however from both ternary diagrams it is inferred that water is high in na and cl the compositional change has been found to be similar as the cation exchange reactions that take place when saltwater intrusion occurs jeen et al 2001 richter and kreitler 1993 most of the groundwater samples indicated a chemical composition dominated by sodium and chloride ions which usually specifies a strong seawater influence pulido leboeuf 2004 chidambaram et al 2017 fig 5 the stiff diagram is also used for investigation of cations and anion dominance at different locations sample wise composition is also shown by stif diagram which is in common cations and anions with concentration represented in electrical equivalents cations are represented on the left side and anions are displayed on the right side of the middle axis stiff 1951 from the stiff diagram it is evident that all the samples have high salinity mean ec 6670 μs cm fig 6 the concentration orders observed for cations and anions are na ca2 mg2 k and cl hco3 so4 2 f the cation composition is dominated by na and ca2 while the anionic composition varies from dominantly cl to hco3 and so4 2 according to gibbs 1970 rivers may have an assemblage of dissolved loads that reflect dominant effects of precipitation rock weathering or evaporation in dry regions all water samples from different wells are mainly located on the upper right of the diagram with na na ca2 ratio greater than 0 7 and high tds between 1260 and 5676 mg l which showed that the groundwater chemistry was not only controlled by rock weathering and or rainwater composition but almost by mixing of saline water or evaporation crystallization the grey shaded area as proposed by gibbs 1970 reflects rock weathering dominance rwd values below the shaded area were proposed to represent atmospheric precipitation dominance apd and tds values above the shaded area are dominated by evaporation crystallization dominance ecd fig 7 a 3 2 2 suitability for irrigation wilcox s diagram is adopted for the classification of geothermal water for local irrigation wherein the ec is plotted against na wilcox 1948 for irrigation purposes u s salinity laboratory has classified water on the basis of ec and na concentration into five different categories as shown in fig 7 d according to wilcox diagram relating sodium percentage and total concentrations indicates that sampes from the study area are unsuitable for irrigation simeonova et al 2003 the agricultural yields are generally very low in the lands irrigated the water of unsuitable category due tothe presence of excess sodium salts this causes osmotic effects on soil plant system high salinity problems are encountered where irrigation activity is in poor drainage agricultural soils and also where water logging allows the water table to rise close to the root zone of plants causing accumulation of sodium salts in the soil solution through capillary rise following surface evaporation liu et al 2012 high amount of unwanted cations can destroy the soil structure due to the de flocculation dispersion of clay particles process hosseinifard and aminiyan 2015 according to the sodium concentration and specific conductance the suitability of the water samples varies from doubtful region to non suitable region fig 7 d only one of the samples falls in the doubtful region but water from all well stations is not conventionally useable for irrigation thus this can be utilized for other applications like fish farming and farming of salinity tolerant potatoes yaycili and alikamanoğlu 2012 from wilcox analysis it is evident that gw2 well is showing behaviour contrasting from other wells the reason for which might be its location in the vicinity of lake bhim talav which causes flushing of groundwater by fresh water consequently diluting the ionic concentration and thus reducing the salinity the series plot verifies this fact and so it is inferred that it can be developed because of low ec and relatively low cation abundance fig 7 b the sodium adsorption ratio sar is a dimensionless parameter used to evaluate the sodium hazard in relation to calcium and magnesium concentrations sappa et al 2014 this parameter is used as an index to evaluate groundwater suitability for the irrigation purposes in the study area ayers and westcot 1994 shaki and adeloye 2006 thus the suitability of the hot water springs and groundwater samples was evaluated by calculating the sar using the following equation richards 1954 1 sar na ca 2 mg 2 2 there is a significant relationship between sodium adsorption ratio of irrigation water and the extent to which sodium is absorbed by the soils nishanthiny et al 2010 if water used for irrigation is high in sodium and low in calcium content then exchangeable calcium in soil may replace sodium by base exchange reaction in water nagaraju et al 2016 this can destroy the soil structure owing to dispersion of the clay particles the sar values in the study area range from 22 5 to 32 with an average of 30 none of the water samples show an sar below the value of 12 fig 7 c thus the fact that the groundwater from study area is not suitable for irrigation purpose has been verified again kelly 1951 had suggested that the sodium problem in irrigation water could be very conveniently identified on the basis of the values of kelly s ratio kelley 1963 suggested that kr for irrigation water should not exceed one kr 1 the kelly s ration of more than one demonstrates an abundance of sodium in groundwater ravikumar et al 2011 kurdi and eslamkish 2017 also based on the equation depletion of ca or mg can lead to an excess level of kelly s index hence waters with a kelly s index more than 1 are unsuitable kelly s ratio is calculated for our study area which ranges from 1 3 to 7 5 table 6 the locations in the study area that have the value of kelly s ratio greater than 1 are unfit for irrigation kelly 1963 2 kr na ca 2 mg 2 3 2 3 impact of water quality for industrial applications in direct or indirect geothermal applications there is gradual reduction in temperature this results in simultaneously decreasing salt solubility which leads to formation of scales on the inner wall of equipment used scale is less conductive so this decreases the heat flux through the walls of equipment leading to decrease in efficiency and overheating ultimately leading to failure of equipment krishnamurthy et al 2014 thus geochemical analysis helps in taking precaution regarding scale formation issue this has to be kept in mind while selecting material for different parts of orc like condenser vaporizer and turbine according to working temperature and pressure conditions selecting the material to be used is a very critical task especially for turbine body and different sections like for transition section column pipe diffuser bowl inlet bell impeller shaft shaft sleeve and wear rings bolting 3 3 hydrodynamic model the following paragraph illustrates the fluid flow model postulated for the present study one of the most important elements of a geothermal reservoir is the cap rock which prevents cold ground water from invading into the high temperature reservoir at depths shallower than 200 m clay altered minerals may be present they are formed at temperature ranging approximately 55 60 c during the drilling of the shallow exploratory wells and such lithologies were detected in the drill cores therefore it is considered that the formation at depths shallower than 400 m acts as a cap rock for the geothermal system that exist in dholera as the clay alterations can be considered impermeable fig 8 depicts that the parental fluid ascends through the high permeable zones developed along the faults which characterize this region the high resistivity rock exists at the deep sub surface while the geothermal source exists in deep regions with manifestations at shallow depths due to circulation aided by convection cells we postulate that both are connected through fault systems certain confidences in these models are provided by the results from the acquired mt survey results sahajpal et al 2015 the main direction of movement at the central section of the acquired profiles appears to be vertical with very limited lateral movement the faults identified are normal in nature the ascending hot fluid yields convective circulation systems beneath the cap rock the fluid reaching shallower part may be from a two phase or vapour dominated reservoir furthermore meteoric water from the recharge area descends through sub vertical channels such as permeable faults or sub vertical intrusive body contacts to a deep heat exchange high temperature zone the resulting mixing converts the meteoric water to high temperature nacl enriched parent geothermal fluid through heat and chemical exchange basically the parent geothermal fluid of geothermal systems has two components meteoric water and magmatic fluid deep level magmatic fluid contributes contents like hcl hf so2 h2o h2s gases which convert to dominant nacl form due to interaction with the host rocks in the subsurface these fluids may in part become trapped below brittle plastic boundaries of intrusions in the form of quartz poly phase nacl inclusions the fluids then ascend through high permeability zones geothermal reservoirs and finally discharge at the earth surface in the form of hot springs flows from recharge to discharge areas are driven by pressure and fluid density differences forced and free convection kiryukhin et al 2002 4 statistical analysis 4 1 bivariate plots the bivariate plots reveal considerable variability in the relationships among different hydrogeochemical parameters at the nine different sites bhattacharya et al 2009 on the bivariate plot of na normalized ca2 versus na normalized hco3 and mg2 fig 9 groundwater samples falls in between the region of evaporite dissolution and silicate weathering evaporites are the rock formed as precipitates by evaporation of saline water evaporites mostly contain halite anhydrite and gypsum thus high na ion concentration in ground water of studied area might be result of dissolution of evaporites combined with mixing of sea water or evaporites are mainly constituted of halites i e nacl biswas et al 2012 by plotting bivariate plots for hco3 and so4 2 corrected ca2 and mg2 to remove the effect of ca2 and mg2 from carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering against cl corrected na to exclude effect of evaporite dissolution fig 10 a aquifer with active cation exchange between na and ca2 and mg2 will show the slope of line equal to 1 i e y x but the slope of best fit linear equation of studied water samples gives slope of 0 1 which shows the water chemistry is not significantly controlled by cation exchange moreover if the water is entirely from meteoric origin ratio of cl to na should be 1 i e the samples should fall on y x line of cl versus na plot but from both the plots it can be seen that water samples are enriched in cl with cl to na ratio greater than 1 for all samples fig 10 b enrichment of cl ion in groundwater might be result of dissolution of chloride containing mineral like chlorapatite or the source may be anthropogenic origin like agricultural and domestic waste water fertilizers water from septic tanks etc bhattacharya et al 2006 4 2 multivariate analyses multivariate statistical techniques have been extensively used to facilitate the solution of environmental problems and suggest evidence for the understanding of some natural and anthropogenic processes selvakumar et al 2017 correlation analysis ca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca have been broadly used as unbiased methods in the analysis of water quality data for drawing meaningful information box et al 1978 chapman 1996 shrivastava and patil 2002 singh et al 2005 pearson s correlation matrices pearson 1896 were used to find relationships between two or more variables and two sets of data bajpayee et al 2012 it is a simplified statistical tool to show the degree of dependency of one variable to another the correlation coefficients of various water quality parameters were calculated and the values of the correlation coefficients are given in table 3 the pearson correlation coefficient is rxy is calculated by using the formula as given patil and patil 2010 jothivenkatachalam et al 2010 kumar and sinha 2010 based on the value of pearson coefficient r the correlation between two parameters plotted on a xy scatter diagram can be termed as a positive or negative das and nag 2015 according to the pearson s correlation samples showing r 0 7 are considered to be strongly correlated whereas r in the range of 0 45 0 7 shows moderate correlation at a significance level strong positive correlations exist between cl and na r 0 98 cl and k r 0 90 and ca2 and mg2 r 0 9812 also tds has a statistically positive correlation with ec r 0 9808 and had a negative correlation with ph r 0 2851 at 0 05 levels ec has positive correlation with tds na k and cl ec indicates that these ions tend to increase in concentration as the salinity of the water increases the salinization of the groundwater can be expected to result from the ionic concentrations increasing due to both evaporation of recharge water and to the effects of interactions between the groundwater and the geological formations everitt et al 2011 in this statistical analysis many correlations are found to be moderate to weak which might be owing to sea water intrusion from the gulf of khambhat and so its direct use for drinking and irrigation is not possible in correlation matrices table dark green and red coloured boxed indicate good correlations while the light coloured boxes represent that weak to moderate correlation is present shanmugasundharam et al 2017 4 3 dendrogram hca hierarchical cluster analysis analysis or dendrogram representation is used for grouping water samples by similar monitoring sites in their chemical composition the multiple water quality parameters can be clustered based on their dependency routroy et al 2013 the sampling locations can be clustered based on chemical similarity in samples collected from various sites in the study area singh et al 2005 shreshtha and kazama 2006 dendrograms are the pictorial representation techniques which classify data with high homogeneity within the cluster group and heterogeneity between the different clusters horizontal axis shows the dissimilarity or improper correlation in the group of data the clusters linked at height near to zero have a strong correlation or the variation of inthe data is less than the other clusters at comparatively more height as these diagrams help to link the properties or the set of properties of particular entity they are also referred to as linkage diagrams in the present study water samples have been collected from the dholera geothermal field and the dendrograms are prepared for water quality parameters fig 11 a and sampling locations fig 11 b fig 11 a shows the dendrogram linking the properties measured in the water from nine wells from the diagram it is inferred that variation in values of f and ph k and so4 2 and ca2 and mg2 are compatible with each other while the variation in the values of na cl tds and ec is comparatively much more than the variation in values of former one standard deviation of all parameters in different wells are as shown in table 2 as the concentration of f ph k so4 2 hco3 ca2 and mg2 are not found varying in the area of study so it can also be estimated to be the same for any future exploitation of groundwater in this area the major concern lies with the values of salinity owing to fluctuation of tds and ec also thus tests for salinity must be carried prior to any use and accordingly measures should be taken this also implies the variation in subsurface geology as intrusion of sea water is not same over the area resulting in high variation of na and cl fig 11 b is the dendrogram linking the wells on the basis of their properties it can be deduced that well u1 and u4 shows good linkage as do wells gw1 and gw4 while there is high variation in measured properties of water from well gw2 as compared to other wells this variation also pertains to the subsurface geology thus the linkage diagram or dendrogram helps in associating areas with similar water properties 5 water quality indices 5 1 langelier saturation index lsi langelier saturation index lsi index is the indicator for capability of water to dissolve or to precipitate the carbonates langlier 1936 lsi is basically difference in ph measured and ph at saturation with respect to calcium carbonate at particular temperature calculations for the same are as follows lsi ph phs langlier 1936 phs 9 3 a b c d where a log10 tds 1 10 0 15 b 13 12 log10 c 273 34 55 c log10 ca2 as caco3 0 4 d log10 alkalinity as caco3 it is also worth that the lsi is temperature sensitive the lsi becomes more positive as the water temperature increases this increase in temperature can cause scaling especially in cases such as geothermal waters haritash et al 2016 lsi of water samples of study area shows that as water is undersaturated with respect to concentration of calcium carbonate so it has tendency to dissolve the scales if already present from viewpoint of scale deposition water quality will not pose a problem of scaling but on contrary it will increase the direct contact of water with metal which increases or enhances corrosion based on the material of the pipe and other ions present in water the same is the case with study area water has no potential for scale formation but it could lead to high corrosion rates table 6 the interpretation of lsi index has been show in tables 4 and 5 6 results and discussions from gibbs classification piper plot stiff diagrams and wilcox plot values of na cl tds and ec are found exceptionally high from cluster analysis i e dendrogram representation and pearson correlation these parameters are the only ones found varying over the region the values of the other parameters do not deviate too much but the values pose a major concern in the use of water for drinking and irrigation purposes high tds values can be attributed to sea water from gulf of khambhat which is very near to study area as shown in fig 1 the salt concentration is too high to be used for irrigation or drinking purposes but to use it for any other direct applications like geothermal hvac or orc it must be treated so as to bring the salt concentration down to the level at which problems of salt water corrosion in the pipelines may be cut down this quality of water can find its use in flushing of toilets or can be used for seawater fish farming moreover saline water has found great use in cooling of thermoelectric power equipments and also in mining considering dholera area in particular it falls under the delhi mumbai industrial corridor fig 1 thus use of saline water from subsurface may provide the benefits of providing power by means of geothermal energy by orc and space heating and cooling system on commercial and industrial basis and also can satisfy the need of water for industries decreasing dependencies on fresh water from piper plot also it is clearly been deduced that water is rich in salts and majorly due to na and cl ions thus the need is to focus on effects and measures to be taken so as to control the concentration of na and cl higher tds leads to foaming in boilers and scale deposition excess chloride content is likely to increase corrosion rate of steel and aluminium solution to this can be use of copper galvanized steel and cast iron pipes attributing their property to high resistance to salt water corrosion but exposure over time can still cause damage thus before planning the strategies for exploitation of groundwater at dholera for industrial purpose care for controlling tds especially na and cl ions has to be taken into account surface facilities for hvac or orc by using geothermal groundwater should be designed with grade of pipes in accordance with high cl concentration water can find its great utility if desalinated at or near well before circulating through pipelines sea water fish cultivation can find its development with prevailing quality of water thus the use of groundwater of such quality for industrial purpose power generation by hot geothermal water space heating and cooling plants fish culture and water for flushing in toilets for mining will result in less dependency on fresh water 7 conclusion water quality analysis is helpful in assessment and management of water quality for various direct and indirect geothermal applications the present investigation represents the first of its type undertaken on the dholera geothermal region gujarat groundwater qualities of dholera region was studied and assessed accordingly the groundwater samples were collected from different wells located at different areas in dholera region the physical and chemical properties were evaluated to investigate geothermal water quality for direct applications and irrigation the parameters like sodium adsorption ratio sar sodium percentage were calculated from the chemical data as per the results obtained sar and na revealed unsuitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes also based on the lsi results it can be concluded that the groundwater in this area is not suitable for industrial applications as well high na and cl concentrations ultimately result in high tds and high ec the spatial distribution of hydrochemical parameters such as tds content ec cl na and mg2 suggests seawater intrusion in the aquifer from gulf of khambhat these obtained parameters would be useful during designing and selection of material for industrial applications most of the water sample exceeds the maximum permissible limit of who standards this implies that the groundwater in dholera region cannot be utilized for drinking and irrigation purposes however the water can be utilized for irrigation and industrial applications after necessary processes such as primary and secondary treatments such as desalination as dholera is a geothermal field geothermal power can be generated in the region and subsequently supplied to the desalination activities this research will be beneficial during the upcoming large scale commercial projects under delhi mumbai industrial corridor dmic acknowledgements

12351,the sustainable development goals place a strong emphasis on water quality however what is the local capacity to ensure safe water availability in a low income country such as malawi where groundwater is still the primary source of drinking water for rural communities we conducted a systematic review of peer reviewed literature containing primary data on groundwater used for drinking water in northern malawi published over the period from 2006 to 2016 we also interviewed district regional and national government representatives supporting the water quality management sector the results showed that the government cannot tell if groundwater is safe for drinking in the northern region of malawi current literature provides only minimal information on groundwater quality for the assessment of human health risks and there are limited laboratory services nitrate and ph were the most commonly available data there is evidence that the following constituents need further investigation about possible human health risks antimony arsenic barium calcium chloride color cyanide cn escherichia coli and or thermotolerant coliform bacteria fluoride iron lead manganese and turbidity water quality monitoring needs to especially consider mining activities including uranium varied levels of engagement appear in that while there is some strengthens in the national government capacity as this is decentralized to districts weaknesses are most evident with no laboratories and either limited data or no data in the case of the most rural districts malawi needs to build human capacity laboratory infrastructure and a publicly available water quality database under national government regulatory oversight with real time monitoring data available to both district and national government decision makers practitioners and water users to determine groundwater quality for the assessment of possible health risks keywords developing countries groundwater malawi rural water supply water quality 1 introduction sustainable development goals sdg 3 6 and 12 place a strong emphasis on water quality united nations 2017 while integrated monitoring and guides for best practices are available un water 2017 the sdgs do not state what water quality constituents for analysis and what frequency of monitoring is needed to safeguard human health practically in a low income country the national water policy set forth by the malawi government 2005 pp 3 states that water of acceptable quality for all the needs in malawi should be made readily available and equitably accessible to all malawians what is the local capacity to ensure safe water availability in a low income country such as malawi where groundwater is still the primary source of drinking water for rural communities the absence of an open access national database of water quality results and the lack of a consistent monitoring program among water users local and national malawian government branches and practitioners make data access and transfer for decision making difficult kayser et al 2015 crane and silliman 2009 suggest for select water quality parameters using basic handheld instruments or test strips in the field at a high frequency by volunteers in rural regions of developing countries despite its lower precision and accuracy this approach may offer a better representation of the temporal and spatial conditions than higher quality analytical instrument data collected by technicians at limited sampling intervals however there have been limited efforts in malawi on effective rural water user participation in water quality monitoring the northern region of malawi covers an area of nearly 27 000 km2 and has a 2008 census population of almost 1 7 million mostly located in rural communities using groundwater for drinking water and spread over 6 districts chitipa karonga likoma mzimba nkhata bay and rumphi malawi government 2009 eidhammer 2017 notes that at the time of independence in 1964 many of the most highly educated malawians were from the north ern region educated at mission schools page 8 although interest in the quality of groundwater used for drinking water is growing globally in northern malawi there has been no systematic review of the currently available data and no determination of what constituents may pose a human health risk and need further investigation or what practical monitoring steps are needed for malawi to meet the sdgs for water quality in malawi the rural water supply is decentralized to districts acting as local governments where the water office is structured identically in each district and reports to the national ministry of agriculture irrigation and water development our work will build on other work in malawi that has looked at water quality governance kayser et al 2015 and the dynamics of power and trust between development partners in the water sector providing funding and the local government soublière and cloutier 2015 it also builds on the global discussion on monitoring requirements and practices observed for other low income countries crocker and bartram 2014 this thought leadership piece highlights the local capacity for how to ensure rural safe water availability in a low income country such as malawi by looking at what groundwater quality laboratory analysis has been done where it has been carried out indicators of possible human health risks and environmental laboratory capacity considerations the aim of our study is to better understand the capacity for rural water quality monitoring and find lessons to share and on the ground implications to inform solutions for attaining the sdgs on water quality in a resource limited environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 systematic literature review a systematic review was conducted of publicly available groundwater data published over the period from 2006 to 2016 however because the malawian government does not publish open access water quality data we only considered peer reviewed literature containing primary groundwater data google scholar and pub med were used as internet search engines keywords for the search included combinations of the following groundwater aquifer water quality well borehole malawi contamination pollution lilongwe blantyre and mzuzu we selected these keywords based on the authors experiences in the field we also searched literature known to the authors the inclusion criteria for the systematic literature review was groundwater sample results where the water may have been used as drinking water from the 6 northern districts of malawi study records were managed in microsoft excel we only used full text papers and if papers were not open access we requested a copy of the paper directly from the authors selected articles were then reviewed by the corresponding author for the origin of authorship funding source and water quality data after which the results were reviewed by all authors we did not include water quality data for urban municipal piped water systems we also did not include grey literature for consistency with accepted systematic review practices such as unpublished data from academic laboratories 2 2 key informant interviews following the systematic literature review from june to december 2017 we conducted face to face or mailed structured surveys focusing on current water quality issues and capacity based on their link to world vision northern zone rural water supply interventions interviews were conducted with local government district water officers n 6 the regional urban piped water supply system provider n 1 government laboratories n 3 located in each the northern central and southern regions and the national ministry in charge of water supply the ministry for agriculture irrigation water and development n 1 surveys were conducted in english key informant interviews with rural water users were not included 2 3 ethics ethical clearance for this study was obtained from the malawi government national commission for science and technology written consent was obtained from respondents all research tools and data are available from the corresponding author 3 results this section presents results on the national water quality guidelines for groundwater used for drinking water by rural communities where and what existing data are available for the northern region plus environmental laboratory capacity infrastructure and human capacity considerations to ensure safe water availability in malawi 3 1 what are the water quality guidelines for drinking water in malawi water quality guidelines for drinking water are set by the national government there are two drinking water quality criteria the malawi bureau of standards mbs ms 214 2013 mbs 2013 which is the drinking water specification for urban and semi urban area piped water providers and ms 733 2005 mbs 2005 which is the specification for groundwater from boreholes and shallow wells used for drinking both of these standards differ from the world health organization who 2017 guidelines while ms 214 2013 has criteria for 58 chemical and physical determinants ms 733 2005 only has criteria for 27 determinants while the who summary tables cover guideline values for 90 chemicals that are of health significance in drinking water there are also differences in the stated levels for example while the who guideline value for fluoride is 1 5 mg l in ms 214 2013 it is 0 7 mg l and in ms 733 2005 it is 6 0 mg l however for other constituents the ms 214 2013 and who criteria are the same such as that for arsenic of 0 01 mg l while ms 733 2005 for arsenic is five times this 0 05 mg l neither mbs guideline mbs 2005 2013 contains water quality criteria for uranium yet the who 2017 has guidance levels for radionuclides in drinking water and for the chemical aspects of uranium though a uranium mine was opened at kayelekera in northern malawi in 2009 nationally only ms 214 2013 includes gross alpha and beta activity this contrasts to namibia where there is also a uranium mine and a drinking water limit for uranium has been set at 1 mg l namwater 2017 during our interviews four respondents mentioned the need for uranium water quality monitoring neither of the mbs guidelines mbs 2005 2013 is available online both are only available as paper copies from mbs offices which would be difficult for rural water users to obtain we probed further into the water quality guidelines for drinking water during our interviews a national ministry representative stated if you apply the who guidelines all of our schemes would fail this was echoed by a government laboratory chemist interviewee who said if we say that it drinking water has to meet these stringent standards who guidelines then a lot of boreholes would be abandoned the interview data show that at a national level there is an awareness of water quality guidelines for groundwater used for drinking water by rural communities and of the differences between national standards mbs 2005 2013 and the guidelines of the who 2017 3 2 where and what are the groundwater data in northern malawi we initially identified 35 articles containing groundwater quality data for the assessment of health risks in malawi and determined a final set of 9 that met our criteria for northern malawi upon detailed review of the work by kanyerere et al 2012 these data were excluded from the analysis based on errors in the reported constituent units the errors were verified by the authors personal communication levy 14 december 2017 table 1 provides a summary of available groundwater data from 2006 to 2016 for northern malawi compared to the ms 733 2005 mbs 2005 and who 2017 while the maximum for a few parameters being over the guideline value is not a clear indicator of health risk nor for groundwater quality when only limited data is available it provides targeted areas that need further investigation of the 27 determinants in ms 733 2005 most 25 27 had some available data nitrate and ph were the most commonly reported data there is evidence that the following constituents need further investigation about possible human health risks antimony arsenic barium calcium chloride color cyanide cn escherichia coli and or thermotolerant coliform bacteria fluoride iron lead manganese and turbidity if n is small how can human health risks be assessed in the case of arsenic the sample size n 25 shows the maximum reported value is 0 0145 mg l which is from a single report mapoma et al 2016 with 3 of 25 samples exceeding the who guideline however this is too limited of evidence without further investigation while mapoma et al 2016 provided the raw water quality data of each sample not all authors offered this level of detail to allow review fig 1 only one 1 8 full article was published with open access for others only the abstract was accessible the journal physics and chemistry of the earth which is linked to the waternet community of practice was the most common source of data 4 8 half 4 8 of the studies had foreign author affiliations involving partnerships with chinese european and american researchers each 8 8 of the articles had multiple authors and most 7 8 had authors from more than one institution in addition data for only two rural water supply practitioners pump aid and wells for zoe were available despite there being more than 20 non governmental organizations ngo and dedicated private sector providers supporting water sanitation and hygiene in the northern region water and environmental sanitation network 2017 most of the existing groundwater data in northern malawi are from grab samples not depth discrete samples from boreholes and shallow wells in rural areas the depth at which the water samples were taken was not typically provided in the available data though whether the water source was a drilled well versus a shallow dug well was generally provided no time series monitoring data were found the largest water quality study identified holm et al 2016a had a sample count of 285 wells and was funded by the practitioner who installed the rural community pumps while all districts in our study would be considered rural no water quality data were found for likoma or chitipa districts the two most difficult and furthest districts to reach in relation to the capital city of lilongwe where the national ministry is based likoma district is in the middle of lake malawi and consists of two islands some rural water supply collaborations have tried to facilitate the creation of sector databases to share data one of these is the open access wpdx water point data exchange database https www waterpointdata org managed by a global working group of water sanitation and hygiene partners most 99 of the data for malawi in wpdx were input by six organizations another of these databases is the madzi alipo database https www madzialipo org managed by fisherman s rest malawi however the data were again primarily uploaded by a few organizations the madzi alipo database includes aspects of spare parts and maintenance and targets sharing fisherman s rest organizational data the madzi alipo database and wpdx upload data to each other which means that the data are not unique and are duplicated moreover the malawian government laboratories are not uploading data into either system and neither of these databases includes water quality data another database is the eawag groundwater assessment platform gap www gapmaps org which targets water quality results but only includes predictions for arsenic and fluoride levels in northern malawi during interviews one respondent indicated that their government laboratory does not keep a consolidated water quality database and when further probed about data sharing said that results were communicated but not necessarily all the way to the rural water user instead reports are issued depending on the sampling objective of the client such as an ngo as well there does not appear to be a practical mechanism or regulatory demand with which to share results between the government laboratory and the rural water user district respondents indicated that communities reporting unsafe water for remediation were rarely cited one district water office representative reported political problems related to water quality monitoring we have seen some councilors ward level politicians allowing people to start accessing water at a newly drilled borehole before water quality testing is done the additional gap in the linkage between the local government and ngos sharing data to the local government is evidenced by another district water office representative which reported ngos do not test water here despite our study finding water quality results from an ngo available in that district table 1 additionally some major partners in the water supply sector who require water quality monitoring as part of their rural water supply infrastructure projects have non disclosure agreements with the analytical laboratory this means additional water quality data may be available but are not being shared nor is there regulatory oversight demanding public access 3 3 laboratory infrastructure and accessibility none of the districts surveyed reported regular or systematic rural groundwater testing for water quality in the northern region of malawi based on the full mbs guidelines mbs 2005 additionally no smaller decentralized laboratories within districts were reported what water quality testing is performed is almost entirely carried out in reaction to increases in water borne diseases at health centers which requires people to get sick before the problem is realized the government laboratory in the northern region can analyze only 4 of 27 determinants from the ms 733 2005 the southern and central regions have fixed water quality laboratories that are able to do much more at 14 and 23 determinants respectively the northern region water board also has a fixed water quality laboratory no ngos or private providers in the northern region are running fixed water quality laboratories though there are academic laboratories at two universities mzuzu university and the university of livingstonia however some communities in remote districts in the northern region are over 6 h away from the central water quality laboratory in lilongwe far exceeding the holding time for microbial sample analysis likewise the transport and processing of rural water samples is expensive in addition to laboratory analysis a sample that requires 6 h of travel time to reach the central water quality laboratory may nearly cost mk50 000 usd 68 in fuel and an additional mk50 000 usd 68 per day for hiring the required 4 wheel drive vehicle suitable for the rural road network some donor organizations require testing for arsenic in the potable water supply arsenic does not impart a color or taste to water it can only be detected through chemical analysis while commercially available colorimetric test kits are relatively inexpensive and easy to use in rural communities there is unpublished personal communication with usaid may 12 2014 evidence in malawi of possible environmental interferences being common this further complicates data interpretation because the presence or absence of these environmental interferences is sometimes not known when a method is selected due to the limited publically available historical water quality data in the case of colorimetric arsenic testing sulfide may interfere positively yielding false positive test results at concentrations greater than 5 mg l s2 other interferences may include selenium antimony and tellurium personal communication with hach despite these possible interferences colorimetric arsenic analysis was the method used by one of the laboratories interviewed while distillation can be carried out to remove environmental interferences prior to arsenic analysis this is often not logistically possible when doing on site field analysis additionally spiked samples such as for arsenic are not available from local suppliers at known concentrations to determine problems with field methods none of the government laboratories in our study was climate controlled with doors and windows observed by researchers to be open at the time of the survey each of the laboratories is challenged by intermittent municipal power and water supplies one laboratory interviewed reported that when fees are charged for water quality analysis such as for support of an ngo project instead of funds being invested back into the laboratory they are deposited in the general national government account some ngos worked around this and were reported to procure the consumable supplies and then depend on the human resources and infrastructure of the government laboratories for analysis another laboratory reported that fees sometimes do not cover the materials and labor so when analytical services were provided the laboratory is operating at a loss in this case there is no incentive for government laboratories to provide fee for use services nonfunctional laboratory equipment was also repeatedly reported as a gap in both necessary parts and technical knowledge to conduct repairs 3 4 human capacity on a limited scale districts are using field kits for basic physical and chemical parameters there was a wide range of qualifications for district water development officers the personnel in charge of the rural water supply some of these personnel were working on a master s degree while in other districts they held a malawi school certificate of education msce which denotes the completion of secondary school high school when asked how rural communities are able to determine if their water is safe one district representative said this they are able but not really because water is a difficult thing if they look at it and it s clear they cannot easily determine that it s not safe but when it s turbid that s when they say this water is not good even myself if it is clear from a borehole i would say it s good if it has no smell it s good district water officer interview on 27 june 2017 such a response indicates that communities of the district cannot be expected to appreciate the intricacies of water quality none of the districts interviewed reported having volunteers within communities analyze rural water quality using field kits it was observed there was a generally low level of understanding of national and who 2017 water quality guidelines for drinking water by district water personnel interviewed while the northern region water board focuses on urban piped water supply systems and does not supply rural water services they also said that we understand there are some areas in the region where we don t have information of water quality on groundwater the representative interviewed was also well qualified holding a master s degree in chemistry and had a strong knowledge of national and who 2017 water quality guidelines for drinking water at the ministry for agriculture irrigation and water development staffing was raised as one of the primary issues by the respondent towards completing the mission and vision of the ministry both in terms of the number and qualifications of staff this respondent held a master s degree and had a strong knowledge of national and who 2017 water quality guidelines and also mentioned the northern region water board capacity for analysis within the northern region this triangulates that at one of the government laboratories it was reported having a staff vacancy rate of 80 another challenge to effective water quality analysis is represented by the following quote from one of our interviews with a government laboratory representative from my observations with time i have spent in the division in the sector itself very few individuals really understand how the laboratory operates one of our surveys revealed an example of this in that donations of water quality monitoring equipment were reported to have been received by the ministry of health whose responsibilities do not include water quality and therefore the equipment was reported to have gone unused the challenge with human capacity and operations was reinforced during several of our interviews the district water offices are dependent on the regional and national government for water quality analysis and monitoring which itself has gaps from the interviews conducted the northern region water board had the highest qualified staff for water quality monitoring in the northern region however their work does not focus on rural groundwater used for drinking but this strong laboratory human resources and infrastructure capacity could be collaboratively leveraged 4 discussion although rural water supply in malawi is decentralized to district responsibilities water quality monitoring remains a function and oversight provided by the national government in addition to limited data no time series monitoring data was available which would have allowed tracing the water quality history of a specific water source mcnicholl et al 2017 reports rumphi district council is updating its waterpoint mapping database updating its district sector investment plan ensuring that ngo activities align with district priorities and hosting learning forums and quarterly meetings this success has not gone unnoticed by other stakeholders while rumphi district has a reportedly strong stakeholder network mcnicholl and colleagues are silent on aspects such as the local capacity for water quality analysis at a district level water monitoring assistants technicians from the water office are placed within rural areas but their main focus is on maintenance and not water quality testing importantly within the northern region the rumphi district water development officer had one of the highest academic qualifications of the districts surveyed and while it has the highest human capacity it still did not have water quality monitoring or evaluation infrastructure in place our findings are similar to those of crocker and bartram 2014 in that the national government relied on a few fixed laboratories in malawi chowns 2015 reports on the problems in malawi with the decentralized rural water supply system and how local ownership of water point functionality and financial performance under community management is weak and compounded by district water offices with no resources to support coordination and supervision if rural communities cannot manage to keep their water source flowing efforts to promote local water analysis are also likely to fail our findings on the limited laboratory infrastructure capacity in northern malawi are also supported by kayser et al 2015 who noted that the technical capacity for water quality laboratory analysis is limited in the central and southern region also the inability of decentralization to determine whether rural water supply is safe is especially evident in rural areas where supplies for analysis must be imported requiring not only financial resources but also the technical capacity to know what chemicals or supplies are needed and where they can be obtained there is also a high import tax and lengthy importation procedure for consumable laboratory supplies that would need to be overcome in comparing responses by different levels of engagement the strongest link is at the national government but practical factors limiting the water quality monitoring in northern malawi are evident moving incrementally down this chain having ms 733 2005 mbs 2005 with guidelines for rural water supply less stringent than who 2017 in place is a good first step to acknowledge local capacity to ensure safe water availability in a low income country such as malawi where groundwater is still the primary source of drinking water for rural communities considering the current capacity at the district government level salinity turbidity e coli and or thermotolerant coliform bacteria and ph should be prioritized as core standards for community health surveillance at appropriate times at a minimum on a seasonal basis for all drinking water supplies each of these can be assessed with either test strips handheld meters or basic field kits but these still must be imported however field kits are not always the best option due to environmental interferences and may have a short lifespan in rough field conditions practically speaking at a district level action level thresholds can be developed to send samples to the government laboratories if results are near human health guideline criteria there are also partnership opportunities that are not happening for water quality analysis with rural water supply and the regional urban piped water supply system provider the government capacity to analyze all mbs constituents is a key limitation of the national laboratory infrastructure including a backup electrical system and reserve water storage tanks the financing required to set up a new regional water quality laboratory in line with every constituent in ms 733 2005 mbs 2005 would likely require an infrastructure investment in the ballpark of usd 1 000 000 most importantly lack of groundwater quality data sharing is driving this problem malawi needs human capacity dedicated to data sharing considering the responsibilities it is recommended that district water development officers have a bachelor of science degree as a minimum qualification the northern region has historically been known for its high level of education and there are two regional universities that may allow the water office personnel to study while maintaining other duties during the time of the first malawi president banda repressed academic and scholarly writing and publication eidhammer 2017 however nearly 25 years later the publication and open access data culture is still limited efforts to create a nationwide database for water quality can only work if all stakeholders are dedicated to data sharing including the governmental laboratories in protection of water users we would argue that the national government should sets rules and enforce a publically available database available to all water users local and national malawian government branches and practitioners there are limitations to this research not all relevant published studies may have used common water quality terms and thus some studies may have been missed by the systematic review however we used a variety of search terms to address this concern the systematic review process was based in malawi and may not have had access to additional databases requiring a subscription that mzuzu university did not have but this review presents a realistic picture of the data publicly available to users practitioners and decision makers 5 conclusion this study has shown that the government cannot tell if rural groundwater is safe for drinking in the northern region of malawi with currently available data providing only minimal information for human health risks however capacity varied by different levels of engagement while there are some strengthens in the national government capacity as this is decentralized to rural areas weaknesses in local capacity are most evident with no laboratories and limited data our study found that key limitations lie within the lack of laboratory infrastructure and gaps in human capacity the remote nature of a majority of the rural water supplies require district or at least regional fixed environmental laboratories there may be some role for field tools as an effective screening tool for specific constituents at the district level water quality monitoring needs to especially consider mining activities including uranium malawi needs a publicly available water quality database under national government regulatory oversight and enforcement with real time monitoring data available to both local and national government decision makers practitioners and water users for decision making based on groundwater quality for the assessment of possible health risks in northern

12351,the sustainable development goals place a strong emphasis on water quality however what is the local capacity to ensure safe water availability in a low income country such as malawi where groundwater is still the primary source of drinking water for rural communities we conducted a systematic review of peer reviewed literature containing primary data on groundwater used for drinking water in northern malawi published over the period from 2006 to 2016 we also interviewed district regional and national government representatives supporting the water quality management sector the results showed that the government cannot tell if groundwater is safe for drinking in the northern region of malawi current literature provides only minimal information on groundwater quality for the assessment of human health risks and there are limited laboratory services nitrate and ph were the most commonly available data there is evidence that the following constituents need further investigation about possible human health risks antimony arsenic barium calcium chloride color cyanide cn escherichia coli and or thermotolerant coliform bacteria fluoride iron lead manganese and turbidity water quality monitoring needs to especially consider mining activities including uranium varied levels of engagement appear in that while there is some strengthens in the national government capacity as this is decentralized to districts weaknesses are most evident with no laboratories and either limited data or no data in the case of the most rural districts malawi needs to build human capacity laboratory infrastructure and a publicly available water quality database under national government regulatory oversight with real time monitoring data available to both district and national government decision makers practitioners and water users to determine groundwater quality for the assessment of possible health risks keywords developing countries groundwater malawi rural water supply water quality 1 introduction sustainable development goals sdg 3 6 and 12 place a strong emphasis on water quality united nations 2017 while integrated monitoring and guides for best practices are available un water 2017 the sdgs do not state what water quality constituents for analysis and what frequency of monitoring is needed to safeguard human health practically in a low income country the national water policy set forth by the malawi government 2005 pp 3 states that water of acceptable quality for all the needs in malawi should be made readily available and equitably accessible to all malawians what is the local capacity to ensure safe water availability in a low income country such as malawi where groundwater is still the primary source of drinking water for rural communities the absence of an open access national database of water quality results and the lack of a consistent monitoring program among water users local and national malawian government branches and practitioners make data access and transfer for decision making difficult kayser et al 2015 crane and silliman 2009 suggest for select water quality parameters using basic handheld instruments or test strips in the field at a high frequency by volunteers in rural regions of developing countries despite its lower precision and accuracy this approach may offer a better representation of the temporal and spatial conditions than higher quality analytical instrument data collected by technicians at limited sampling intervals however there have been limited efforts in malawi on effective rural water user participation in water quality monitoring the northern region of malawi covers an area of nearly 27 000 km2 and has a 2008 census population of almost 1 7 million mostly located in rural communities using groundwater for drinking water and spread over 6 districts chitipa karonga likoma mzimba nkhata bay and rumphi malawi government 2009 eidhammer 2017 notes that at the time of independence in 1964 many of the most highly educated malawians were from the north ern region educated at mission schools page 8 although interest in the quality of groundwater used for drinking water is growing globally in northern malawi there has been no systematic review of the currently available data and no determination of what constituents may pose a human health risk and need further investigation or what practical monitoring steps are needed for malawi to meet the sdgs for water quality in malawi the rural water supply is decentralized to districts acting as local governments where the water office is structured identically in each district and reports to the national ministry of agriculture irrigation and water development our work will build on other work in malawi that has looked at water quality governance kayser et al 2015 and the dynamics of power and trust between development partners in the water sector providing funding and the local government soublière and cloutier 2015 it also builds on the global discussion on monitoring requirements and practices observed for other low income countries crocker and bartram 2014 this thought leadership piece highlights the local capacity for how to ensure rural safe water availability in a low income country such as malawi by looking at what groundwater quality laboratory analysis has been done where it has been carried out indicators of possible human health risks and environmental laboratory capacity considerations the aim of our study is to better understand the capacity for rural water quality monitoring and find lessons to share and on the ground implications to inform solutions for attaining the sdgs on water quality in a resource limited environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 systematic literature review a systematic review was conducted of publicly available groundwater data published over the period from 2006 to 2016 however because the malawian government does not publish open access water quality data we only considered peer reviewed literature containing primary groundwater data google scholar and pub med were used as internet search engines keywords for the search included combinations of the following groundwater aquifer water quality well borehole malawi contamination pollution lilongwe blantyre and mzuzu we selected these keywords based on the authors experiences in the field we also searched literature known to the authors the inclusion criteria for the systematic literature review was groundwater sample results where the water may have been used as drinking water from the 6 northern districts of malawi study records were managed in microsoft excel we only used full text papers and if papers were not open access we requested a copy of the paper directly from the authors selected articles were then reviewed by the corresponding author for the origin of authorship funding source and water quality data after which the results were reviewed by all authors we did not include water quality data for urban municipal piped water systems we also did not include grey literature for consistency with accepted systematic review practices such as unpublished data from academic laboratories 2 2 key informant interviews following the systematic literature review from june to december 2017 we conducted face to face or mailed structured surveys focusing on current water quality issues and capacity based on their link to world vision northern zone rural water supply interventions interviews were conducted with local government district water officers n 6 the regional urban piped water supply system provider n 1 government laboratories n 3 located in each the northern central and southern regions and the national ministry in charge of water supply the ministry for agriculture irrigation water and development n 1 surveys were conducted in english key informant interviews with rural water users were not included 2 3 ethics ethical clearance for this study was obtained from the malawi government national commission for science and technology written consent was obtained from respondents all research tools and data are available from the corresponding author 3 results this section presents results on the national water quality guidelines for groundwater used for drinking water by rural communities where and what existing data are available for the northern region plus environmental laboratory capacity infrastructure and human capacity considerations to ensure safe water availability in malawi 3 1 what are the water quality guidelines for drinking water in malawi water quality guidelines for drinking water are set by the national government there are two drinking water quality criteria the malawi bureau of standards mbs ms 214 2013 mbs 2013 which is the drinking water specification for urban and semi urban area piped water providers and ms 733 2005 mbs 2005 which is the specification for groundwater from boreholes and shallow wells used for drinking both of these standards differ from the world health organization who 2017 guidelines while ms 214 2013 has criteria for 58 chemical and physical determinants ms 733 2005 only has criteria for 27 determinants while the who summary tables cover guideline values for 90 chemicals that are of health significance in drinking water there are also differences in the stated levels for example while the who guideline value for fluoride is 1 5 mg l in ms 214 2013 it is 0 7 mg l and in ms 733 2005 it is 6 0 mg l however for other constituents the ms 214 2013 and who criteria are the same such as that for arsenic of 0 01 mg l while ms 733 2005 for arsenic is five times this 0 05 mg l neither mbs guideline mbs 2005 2013 contains water quality criteria for uranium yet the who 2017 has guidance levels for radionuclides in drinking water and for the chemical aspects of uranium though a uranium mine was opened at kayelekera in northern malawi in 2009 nationally only ms 214 2013 includes gross alpha and beta activity this contrasts to namibia where there is also a uranium mine and a drinking water limit for uranium has been set at 1 mg l namwater 2017 during our interviews four respondents mentioned the need for uranium water quality monitoring neither of the mbs guidelines mbs 2005 2013 is available online both are only available as paper copies from mbs offices which would be difficult for rural water users to obtain we probed further into the water quality guidelines for drinking water during our interviews a national ministry representative stated if you apply the who guidelines all of our schemes would fail this was echoed by a government laboratory chemist interviewee who said if we say that it drinking water has to meet these stringent standards who guidelines then a lot of boreholes would be abandoned the interview data show that at a national level there is an awareness of water quality guidelines for groundwater used for drinking water by rural communities and of the differences between national standards mbs 2005 2013 and the guidelines of the who 2017 3 2 where and what are the groundwater data in northern malawi we initially identified 35 articles containing groundwater quality data for the assessment of health risks in malawi and determined a final set of 9 that met our criteria for northern malawi upon detailed review of the work by kanyerere et al 2012 these data were excluded from the analysis based on errors in the reported constituent units the errors were verified by the authors personal communication levy 14 december 2017 table 1 provides a summary of available groundwater data from 2006 to 2016 for northern malawi compared to the ms 733 2005 mbs 2005 and who 2017 while the maximum for a few parameters being over the guideline value is not a clear indicator of health risk nor for groundwater quality when only limited data is available it provides targeted areas that need further investigation of the 27 determinants in ms 733 2005 most 25 27 had some available data nitrate and ph were the most commonly reported data there is evidence that the following constituents need further investigation about possible human health risks antimony arsenic barium calcium chloride color cyanide cn escherichia coli and or thermotolerant coliform bacteria fluoride iron lead manganese and turbidity if n is small how can human health risks be assessed in the case of arsenic the sample size n 25 shows the maximum reported value is 0 0145 mg l which is from a single report mapoma et al 2016 with 3 of 25 samples exceeding the who guideline however this is too limited of evidence without further investigation while mapoma et al 2016 provided the raw water quality data of each sample not all authors offered this level of detail to allow review fig 1 only one 1 8 full article was published with open access for others only the abstract was accessible the journal physics and chemistry of the earth which is linked to the waternet community of practice was the most common source of data 4 8 half 4 8 of the studies had foreign author affiliations involving partnerships with chinese european and american researchers each 8 8 of the articles had multiple authors and most 7 8 had authors from more than one institution in addition data for only two rural water supply practitioners pump aid and wells for zoe were available despite there being more than 20 non governmental organizations ngo and dedicated private sector providers supporting water sanitation and hygiene in the northern region water and environmental sanitation network 2017 most of the existing groundwater data in northern malawi are from grab samples not depth discrete samples from boreholes and shallow wells in rural areas the depth at which the water samples were taken was not typically provided in the available data though whether the water source was a drilled well versus a shallow dug well was generally provided no time series monitoring data were found the largest water quality study identified holm et al 2016a had a sample count of 285 wells and was funded by the practitioner who installed the rural community pumps while all districts in our study would be considered rural no water quality data were found for likoma or chitipa districts the two most difficult and furthest districts to reach in relation to the capital city of lilongwe where the national ministry is based likoma district is in the middle of lake malawi and consists of two islands some rural water supply collaborations have tried to facilitate the creation of sector databases to share data one of these is the open access wpdx water point data exchange database https www waterpointdata org managed by a global working group of water sanitation and hygiene partners most 99 of the data for malawi in wpdx were input by six organizations another of these databases is the madzi alipo database https www madzialipo org managed by fisherman s rest malawi however the data were again primarily uploaded by a few organizations the madzi alipo database includes aspects of spare parts and maintenance and targets sharing fisherman s rest organizational data the madzi alipo database and wpdx upload data to each other which means that the data are not unique and are duplicated moreover the malawian government laboratories are not uploading data into either system and neither of these databases includes water quality data another database is the eawag groundwater assessment platform gap www gapmaps org which targets water quality results but only includes predictions for arsenic and fluoride levels in northern malawi during interviews one respondent indicated that their government laboratory does not keep a consolidated water quality database and when further probed about data sharing said that results were communicated but not necessarily all the way to the rural water user instead reports are issued depending on the sampling objective of the client such as an ngo as well there does not appear to be a practical mechanism or regulatory demand with which to share results between the government laboratory and the rural water user district respondents indicated that communities reporting unsafe water for remediation were rarely cited one district water office representative reported political problems related to water quality monitoring we have seen some councilors ward level politicians allowing people to start accessing water at a newly drilled borehole before water quality testing is done the additional gap in the linkage between the local government and ngos sharing data to the local government is evidenced by another district water office representative which reported ngos do not test water here despite our study finding water quality results from an ngo available in that district table 1 additionally some major partners in the water supply sector who require water quality monitoring as part of their rural water supply infrastructure projects have non disclosure agreements with the analytical laboratory this means additional water quality data may be available but are not being shared nor is there regulatory oversight demanding public access 3 3 laboratory infrastructure and accessibility none of the districts surveyed reported regular or systematic rural groundwater testing for water quality in the northern region of malawi based on the full mbs guidelines mbs 2005 additionally no smaller decentralized laboratories within districts were reported what water quality testing is performed is almost entirely carried out in reaction to increases in water borne diseases at health centers which requires people to get sick before the problem is realized the government laboratory in the northern region can analyze only 4 of 27 determinants from the ms 733 2005 the southern and central regions have fixed water quality laboratories that are able to do much more at 14 and 23 determinants respectively the northern region water board also has a fixed water quality laboratory no ngos or private providers in the northern region are running fixed water quality laboratories though there are academic laboratories at two universities mzuzu university and the university of livingstonia however some communities in remote districts in the northern region are over 6 h away from the central water quality laboratory in lilongwe far exceeding the holding time for microbial sample analysis likewise the transport and processing of rural water samples is expensive in addition to laboratory analysis a sample that requires 6 h of travel time to reach the central water quality laboratory may nearly cost mk50 000 usd 68 in fuel and an additional mk50 000 usd 68 per day for hiring the required 4 wheel drive vehicle suitable for the rural road network some donor organizations require testing for arsenic in the potable water supply arsenic does not impart a color or taste to water it can only be detected through chemical analysis while commercially available colorimetric test kits are relatively inexpensive and easy to use in rural communities there is unpublished personal communication with usaid may 12 2014 evidence in malawi of possible environmental interferences being common this further complicates data interpretation because the presence or absence of these environmental interferences is sometimes not known when a method is selected due to the limited publically available historical water quality data in the case of colorimetric arsenic testing sulfide may interfere positively yielding false positive test results at concentrations greater than 5 mg l s2 other interferences may include selenium antimony and tellurium personal communication with hach despite these possible interferences colorimetric arsenic analysis was the method used by one of the laboratories interviewed while distillation can be carried out to remove environmental interferences prior to arsenic analysis this is often not logistically possible when doing on site field analysis additionally spiked samples such as for arsenic are not available from local suppliers at known concentrations to determine problems with field methods none of the government laboratories in our study was climate controlled with doors and windows observed by researchers to be open at the time of the survey each of the laboratories is challenged by intermittent municipal power and water supplies one laboratory interviewed reported that when fees are charged for water quality analysis such as for support of an ngo project instead of funds being invested back into the laboratory they are deposited in the general national government account some ngos worked around this and were reported to procure the consumable supplies and then depend on the human resources and infrastructure of the government laboratories for analysis another laboratory reported that fees sometimes do not cover the materials and labor so when analytical services were provided the laboratory is operating at a loss in this case there is no incentive for government laboratories to provide fee for use services nonfunctional laboratory equipment was also repeatedly reported as a gap in both necessary parts and technical knowledge to conduct repairs 3 4 human capacity on a limited scale districts are using field kits for basic physical and chemical parameters there was a wide range of qualifications for district water development officers the personnel in charge of the rural water supply some of these personnel were working on a master s degree while in other districts they held a malawi school certificate of education msce which denotes the completion of secondary school high school when asked how rural communities are able to determine if their water is safe one district representative said this they are able but not really because water is a difficult thing if they look at it and it s clear they cannot easily determine that it s not safe but when it s turbid that s when they say this water is not good even myself if it is clear from a borehole i would say it s good if it has no smell it s good district water officer interview on 27 june 2017 such a response indicates that communities of the district cannot be expected to appreciate the intricacies of water quality none of the districts interviewed reported having volunteers within communities analyze rural water quality using field kits it was observed there was a generally low level of understanding of national and who 2017 water quality guidelines for drinking water by district water personnel interviewed while the northern region water board focuses on urban piped water supply systems and does not supply rural water services they also said that we understand there are some areas in the region where we don t have information of water quality on groundwater the representative interviewed was also well qualified holding a master s degree in chemistry and had a strong knowledge of national and who 2017 water quality guidelines for drinking water at the ministry for agriculture irrigation and water development staffing was raised as one of the primary issues by the respondent towards completing the mission and vision of the ministry both in terms of the number and qualifications of staff this respondent held a master s degree and had a strong knowledge of national and who 2017 water quality guidelines and also mentioned the northern region water board capacity for analysis within the northern region this triangulates that at one of the government laboratories it was reported having a staff vacancy rate of 80 another challenge to effective water quality analysis is represented by the following quote from one of our interviews with a government laboratory representative from my observations with time i have spent in the division in the sector itself very few individuals really understand how the laboratory operates one of our surveys revealed an example of this in that donations of water quality monitoring equipment were reported to have been received by the ministry of health whose responsibilities do not include water quality and therefore the equipment was reported to have gone unused the challenge with human capacity and operations was reinforced during several of our interviews the district water offices are dependent on the regional and national government for water quality analysis and monitoring which itself has gaps from the interviews conducted the northern region water board had the highest qualified staff for water quality monitoring in the northern region however their work does not focus on rural groundwater used for drinking but this strong laboratory human resources and infrastructure capacity could be collaboratively leveraged 4 discussion although rural water supply in malawi is decentralized to district responsibilities water quality monitoring remains a function and oversight provided by the national government in addition to limited data no time series monitoring data was available which would have allowed tracing the water quality history of a specific water source mcnicholl et al 2017 reports rumphi district council is updating its waterpoint mapping database updating its district sector investment plan ensuring that ngo activities align with district priorities and hosting learning forums and quarterly meetings this success has not gone unnoticed by other stakeholders while rumphi district has a reportedly strong stakeholder network mcnicholl and colleagues are silent on aspects such as the local capacity for water quality analysis at a district level water monitoring assistants technicians from the water office are placed within rural areas but their main focus is on maintenance and not water quality testing importantly within the northern region the rumphi district water development officer had one of the highest academic qualifications of the districts surveyed and while it has the highest human capacity it still did not have water quality monitoring or evaluation infrastructure in place our findings are similar to those of crocker and bartram 2014 in that the national government relied on a few fixed laboratories in malawi chowns 2015 reports on the problems in malawi with the decentralized rural water supply system and how local ownership of water point functionality and financial performance under community management is weak and compounded by district water offices with no resources to support coordination and supervision if rural communities cannot manage to keep their water source flowing efforts to promote local water analysis are also likely to fail our findings on the limited laboratory infrastructure capacity in northern malawi are also supported by kayser et al 2015 who noted that the technical capacity for water quality laboratory analysis is limited in the central and southern region also the inability of decentralization to determine whether rural water supply is safe is especially evident in rural areas where supplies for analysis must be imported requiring not only financial resources but also the technical capacity to know what chemicals or supplies are needed and where they can be obtained there is also a high import tax and lengthy importation procedure for consumable laboratory supplies that would need to be overcome in comparing responses by different levels of engagement the strongest link is at the national government but practical factors limiting the water quality monitoring in northern malawi are evident moving incrementally down this chain having ms 733 2005 mbs 2005 with guidelines for rural water supply less stringent than who 2017 in place is a good first step to acknowledge local capacity to ensure safe water availability in a low income country such as malawi where groundwater is still the primary source of drinking water for rural communities considering the current capacity at the district government level salinity turbidity e coli and or thermotolerant coliform bacteria and ph should be prioritized as core standards for community health surveillance at appropriate times at a minimum on a seasonal basis for all drinking water supplies each of these can be assessed with either test strips handheld meters or basic field kits but these still must be imported however field kits are not always the best option due to environmental interferences and may have a short lifespan in rough field conditions practically speaking at a district level action level thresholds can be developed to send samples to the government laboratories if results are near human health guideline criteria there are also partnership opportunities that are not happening for water quality analysis with rural water supply and the regional urban piped water supply system provider the government capacity to analyze all mbs constituents is a key limitation of the national laboratory infrastructure including a backup electrical system and reserve water storage tanks the financing required to set up a new regional water quality laboratory in line with every constituent in ms 733 2005 mbs 2005 would likely require an infrastructure investment in the ballpark of usd 1 000 000 most importantly lack of groundwater quality data sharing is driving this problem malawi needs human capacity dedicated to data sharing considering the responsibilities it is recommended that district water development officers have a bachelor of science degree as a minimum qualification the northern region has historically been known for its high level of education and there are two regional universities that may allow the water office personnel to study while maintaining other duties during the time of the first malawi president banda repressed academic and scholarly writing and publication eidhammer 2017 however nearly 25 years later the publication and open access data culture is still limited efforts to create a nationwide database for water quality can only work if all stakeholders are dedicated to data sharing including the governmental laboratories in protection of water users we would argue that the national government should sets rules and enforce a publically available database available to all water users local and national malawian government branches and practitioners there are limitations to this research not all relevant published studies may have used common water quality terms and thus some studies may have been missed by the systematic review however we used a variety of search terms to address this concern the systematic review process was based in malawi and may not have had access to additional databases requiring a subscription that mzuzu university did not have but this review presents a realistic picture of the data publicly available to users practitioners and decision makers 5 conclusion this study has shown that the government cannot tell if rural groundwater is safe for drinking in the northern region of malawi with currently available data providing only minimal information for human health risks however capacity varied by different levels of engagement while there are some strengthens in the national government capacity as this is decentralized to rural areas weaknesses in local capacity are most evident with no laboratories and limited data our study found that key limitations lie within the lack of laboratory infrastructure and gaps in human capacity the remote nature of a majority of the rural water supplies require district or at least regional fixed environmental laboratories there may be some role for field tools as an effective screening tool for specific constituents at the district level water quality monitoring needs to especially consider mining activities including uranium malawi needs a publicly available water quality database under national government regulatory oversight and enforcement with real time monitoring data available to both local and national government decision makers practitioners and water users for decision making based on groundwater quality for the assessment of possible health risks in northern

12352,groundwater quality studies of coal mining areas are very important due to coal explorations dumping of huge quantity of over burdens and subsequently mixing with the coal mine drainage areas the main objective of this study was to evaluate the possible influence of acid mine drainage amd in the groundwater in terms of major ions trace elements and identifying the hydrogeochemical characteristics in the rajrappa coal mining area in the central part of india the results show that groundwater is generally neutral to alkaline in nature the major ions and trace elements concentrations in the groundwater samples were found to be below the permissible limits based on who guidelines and suitable for the drinking water purposes few wells show a higher order in certain parameters due to impact local geologic strata the piper diagram shows two major hydrochemical water types represents such as ca mg cl and ca mg hco3 types based on major ion concentrations and its minor variations are indicative of the stable geochemical and hydrologic environments which controls the groundwater chemistry in the coal mining area geochemical evolution of the groundwater chemistry mainly controls by the natural geochemical processes such as mineral dissolution rock water interactions and mineral precipitation processes saturation index studies show that groundwater samples were near saturation to equilibrium conditions with the carbonate phase minerals of calcite and dolomite and undersaturated with gypsum and anhydrite secondary minerals of fe and mn sulphate and carbonate phase species are in undersaturated conditions the shorter residence times of groundwater in the wells lack of acid mine drainage generating conditions and the impact of dilution during high base flows are diluting the coal mining drainage streams and making a negligible impact of acid mine drainage graphical abstract fx1 keywords hydrochemistry groundwater water quality trace elements acid mine drainage amd carbonate phase minerals rajrappa coal mines 1 introduction groundwater resources in coal mining areas are known to be vulnerable to pollution and that may have a serious impact on environment groundwater contaminations due to the coal mining operations are a worldwide problem younger 2004 cravotta 2008a wright et al 2017 depletion of groundwater quality acid water generation and mixing with the surrounding water release of heavy metals is a common phenomenon occurs in coal mining areas water contamination caused by acid mine drainage amd one of the well known sources of water pollution coal mining drainage cmd can be strongly affected by amd due to the interaction of water with the pyrite content in coal which can generate acidic water that leaches and mobilizes metals from the surrounding geology johnson 2003 the acidic water generated from the amd sources and corroded the country rock and releases additional metals contaminate the surrounding aquifer and adversely affect the groundwater resources for the domestic supply and consumption of the of the region coal mining drainage cmd are frequently enriched with sulfuric acid and heavy metals at higher levels which could contaminate the surrounding streams and aquifer in the region in coal mining areas the continuous influx and mixing of acid mine drainage amd with groundwater and surface water which gradually degraded and leads to lower ph value and that enhances the mobility of trace elements in the groundwater with high concentrations kleinman et al 1981 the mobility of trace elements further enhances due to movement of contaminated water in the aquifer through fractures and cracks in the rocks and also through the coal mine drainage networks cravotta 2005 coal mining operations generate huge quantities of solids due to over burden dumping and liquid wastes from the coal washing plants the untreated water releases from coal washing plants which contain higher levels of tss tds trace elements and which were acidic in nature and mixed with surface and groundwater of the surrounding area due to the uncontrolled discharge of solid and liquid wastes related to the coal mining operations and interacts with the aquifer and degrades the water resources of the region the groundwater contamination and environmental problems related to the coal mining areas in different parts of world were reported by several authors kim and chon 2001 younger 2001 johnson and hallberg 2005 goodarzi et al 2008 singh et al 2010 keskin 2013 zakir et al 2013 li et al 2013 alhamed and wohnlich 2014 cravotta 2015 cravotta and brady 2015 groundwater has been contacts with coal bearing sediments and also due to the influence of coal mining drainage with the surrounding aquifer in the area which leads to the enrichment of trace elements trace elements in groundwater primarily come from source rock and also from various anthropogenic activities the main threat comes from exposure of lead cadmium cobalt nickel mercury arsenic and other trace elements have been extensively studied and their effects on human health regularly reviewed in many authors larocqu and rasmussen 1998 usepa 2002 jarup 2003 who 2008 trace elements such as as co cd ni fe mn cu se pb and u are concentrated in coal bearing strata and released to the coal mine drainage cmd through various

precipitation in the acidic sulphate water norddstrom 2011 bhattacharya et al 2012 manganese mn concentrations in groundwater were controlled by many factors such as rock water interaction in the aquifer water chemistry and microbiological activity homoncik et al 2010 manganese often occurs with iron in groundwater and usually occurs in lower levels than iron concentrations lead pb in the groundwater is derived from the decay of parent nuclides of uranium series and dissolve of pb bearing minerals and rocks in the aquifer hem 1976 the zn concentrations were found in natural surface water is usually below 10 µg l and in groundwater around 10 40 µg l nriagu 1980 in the rajrappa coal mining area consists of few open cast coal mines and one of the largest coal fields the region in the ramgarh district of jharkhand state and operating for the last 4 decades by central coalfields limited ccl the rajrappa coal mining area in the bank of damodar river there is a coal reserve of 72 million tones with ongoing annual production of 6 0 million tones as reported by geological survey of india there was no comprehensive report on water quality parameters and hydrogeochemical study on coal mining area of this region therefore the present study was carried out to investigate about the assessment of water quality parameters and hydrogeochemical characteristics of major ions trace elements concentrations in the groundwater samples groundwater was used as the major source for the drinking water purposes in the area the water quality studies are very relevant the main objectives of the present work will be focusing about the 1 assessment of water quality parameters for major ions trace elements concentrations in groundwater samples 2 hydrogeochemical processes which controls the groundwater composition 3 impact of any acid mine drainage on groundwater resources 4 and also to make a database on water quality data which will be useful for the sustainable use and management

mining area with the observation wells fig 2 2 3 water sampling and chemical analysis a total of 10 groundwater samples were collected from the study area for the water quality and hydrogeochemical studies during the pre monsoon period june 2011 and post monsoon periods january 2012 respectively groundwater samples were collected from the dug wells hand pumps in the surrounding village areas from 9 locations and one surface water sample was collected from the bhera river for the regular monitoring fig 1 the water levels from the ground level are varies from 1 3 to 6 5 m in pre monsoon period and 1 75 5 6 m in post monsoon period during the time of measurement the groundwater flow pattern is from northwestern towards southeastern side though the numerous streams and flow channels and finally falls on the bhera river groundwater sample analyses for major ions concentrations using the standard american public health association procedure apha 1995 and were carried out in the telengana state groundwater department hyderabad water sample locations with their physico chemical parameters and descriptive statistics for the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods and are presented in tables 1 and 2 the water quality parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured using a bench top meter adwa a8000 the ionic concentrations of cations such as na and k were analyzed by a flame photometer elico 370 ca2 mg2 hco3 and cl by classical volumetric method so4 2 by a spectro photometer no3 and f were analyzed using ion electrodes the ionic balance for all the analyses were found to be within a limit of less than 5 trace elements such as ba cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb zn were analyzed by using an icp oes perkinelmer optima 4300 dv at csir national geophysical research institute hyderabad for the trace metals analyses groundwater samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm filter paper and acidified by ultra pure nitric acid to maintain the ph level below 2 the multi elemental reference standard materials nist srm 1643e were used for the quality control purposes the reference standards and the duplicates were analyzed after every 10 samples to check the accuracy and precision of the results the results of observed values for all the trace metals were found within the 10 sdv of the reported values the results for the trace elements concentrations were presented in table 5 piper diagrams and saturation index si values with respect to major ions for the groundwater samples were computed using aquachem software 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater chemistry results for the major ion concentrations for the groundwater samples n 9 and surface water n 1 in the study area along with their basic statistical summaries for the pre monsoon and post monsoon period are shown tables 1 and 2 respectively correlation matrixes for the major ions were evaluated to understand the relationships between different ionic species of groundwater samples for the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods table 3a 3b respectively the saturation indexes of carbonate phase minerals were calculated for the groundwater samples and shown in table 4 contributions of major ions in meq l of the groundwater samples are found to be as na 12 89 15 59 k 1 07 0 74 ca2 26 79 23 13 mg2 10 38 10 72 so4 2 11 76 9 01 no3 2 70 5 86 cl 16 95 14 49 f 0 50 0 56 hco3 16 96 19 91 in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively in groundwater ph varies from 6 78 to 7 7 mean value of 7 34 0 25 and 7 3 8 0 mean value of 7 56 0 21 for the pre monsoon and post monsoon period respectively the mean ph value in this area indicates water samples are neutral to slightly alkaline in nature electrical conductivity ec values of groundwater varies from 180 to 900 mean value of 568 218 μs cm and 391 969 mean value of 687 156 μs cm for the pre monsoon and post monsoon period respectively total dissolved solids tds ranges from 156 576 mg l mean value of 368 132 mg l and 250 620 mg l mean value of 440 100 mg l for the pre monsoon and post monsoon period respectively higher levels of ec and tds in the post monsoon period indicated higher mineralization and dissolution takes place in the groundwater the low tds concentrations are attributed to the shallow groundwater without much dissolution of rocks in the surrounding aquifer tds show strong positive correlation with ca2 r2 0 98 so4 2 r2 0 71 and cl r2 0 90 and moderate correlation r2 0 42 0 40 0 36 with na k and hco3 respectively for the pre monsoon period table 3a tds show positive correlation with ca2 r2 0 91 na r2 73 so4 2 r2 0 79 and cl r2 0 78 and moderate correlation r2 0 44 0 26 0 60 with k mg2 and no3 respectively for the post monsoon period table 3b sodium na concentrations ranges from 9 to 63 mg l mean value 38 21 mg l in the pre monsoon period and 19 78 mg l mean value 44 22 mg l in the post monsoon period potassium k concentration ranges from 4 to 8 mg l mean value 5 4 1 26 mg l and 1 8 mg l mean value 3 5 2 55 mg l for the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively although the concentration of potassium is high in the k feldspar bearing rocks and soils due to its low mobility in the hydrosphere k concentrations are low in the groundwater system calcium ca2 concentrations varies from 26 to 119 mean value 69 28 mg l and 30 82 mean value 57 13 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively magnesium mg2 concentrations in the groundwater range from 4 to 37 mg l mean value 16 9 mg l and 4 45 mg l mean value 16 12 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively the major source of calcium and magnesium in the groundwater is due to ion exchange of minerals in the aquifer sulphate so4 2 concentrations ranges from 9 to 124 mg l mean value of 73 35 mg l and 15 90 mg l mean value of 54 25 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively the lowest value of sulphate concentration was found in surface water sample from the bhera river nitrate no3 concentrations are varies from 6 29 to 52 mg l mean value of 22 13 mg l and 2 103 mg l mean value of 45 36 in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively higher nitrate concentrations 45 mg l found in few groundwater samples were found in the cattle farms complexes and release of domestic sewage from the septic tanks to the surrounding area also the applications of nitrogen fertilizers for the seasonal crops enhance the nitrate concentrations in groundwater chloride cl concentrations ranges from 26 to 158 mg l and mean value 78 45 mg l and 15 115 mg l and mean value of 64 34 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively the chloride cl concentrations in groundwater can be derived through the mixing of domestic wastewaters septic tanks and applications of chemical fertilizers hem 1989 appelo and postma 1996 fluoride f concentrations varies from 0 3 to 3 21 mg l mean value of 1 23 1 23 mg l and 0 41 3 17 mg l mean value of 1 31 0 97 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon period respectively the higher levels of f 1 5 mg l in few samples are due to the local enrichment of fluoride bearing ions in the groundwater the fluoride concentration in groundwater basically originates from the dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals high fluorine content in coal the rock water interaction and weathering of fluoride bearing minerals and rocks prolonged period of contact of groundwater with the host rock and also enters the surface waters through runoff fluoride mobility in water controlled by presence of as to a larger of extent of ca2 ions since fluoride forms low solubility compounds with divalent cations hem 1989 in groundwater bicarbonate hco3 concentrations ranges from 89 to 164 mg l mean value of 134 28 mg l and 65 198 mg l mean value of 150 36 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively higher bicarbonate hco3 concentrations are indicative of carbonate weathering and local enrichment of decomposition of organic matter also bicarbonate concentrations in the groundwater could be enhanced due to the rock water interactions as evidenced by the relatively higher calcium and magnesium levels and bicarbonate concentration groundwater compositions that are primarily controlled by carbonate reactions will have relatively high calcium and magnesium and bicarbonate contents are attributed to the presence of calcite and dolomite stumm and morgan 1981 the carbonate co3 and bicarbonate hco3 concentrations in groundwater were principally attributed to the dissolution and weathering of carbonate phase minerals and dissolution of carbonic acid in the aquifers it is evident from the groundwater chemistry the minor variations are indicative of the stable geochemical and hydrologic environments which controlling the groundwater quality in the coal mining area 3 2 hydrogeochemical evaluation the scatter diagrams between different ions can reveal information about the origin and evolution solutes and about the hydrogeochemical processes control mechanism occurring in the aquifer edmunds et al 1987 the reactions between groundwater and the aquifer matrix can significantly control the water chemistry the cross plot between na vs cl in diagram fig 3a shows most of the sample points falls below the equiline and predominance of na ions over cl ions suggests addition of na ions released from the weathering of silicate minerals and ion exchange within the aquifer mayback 1987 the na vs ca2 scatter diagram fig 3b shows higher levels of calcium concentrations than sodium concentrations and also indicate the ion exchange reactions occurring in the aquifer which increases the ca2 concentrations in groundwater the scatter diagram of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 hco3 shows most of the ionic concentrations falls above the equiline 1 1 and shown in fig 3c6 the points above the equiline indicates carbonate weathering where as points falling below the line represents mixed source such as carbonate weathering and silicate weathering datta and tyagi 1996 the scatter diagram of ca2 mg2 versus total cations plot fig 3d shows the data points falling near the equiline and ratio varies from 0 55 to 0 83 with an average equilibrium ratio of 0 68 at lower level of mineralization when the ratio approximates to 1 0 indicating these ions are the primary source for controlling the composition of the groundwater when the ca2 mg2 data deviates from the equiline 1 1 other cations na k contributes to the groundwater chemistry and reverse cation exchange takes place fisher and mullican 1997 the dissolution of carbonate phase minerals rock water interactions and ion exchange processes in the aquifer controls cations in the carbonate bearing rocks younger et al 2002 the ca2 and mg2 concentrations were derived from the dissolution of carbonate rich sediments such as calcite dolomite and sulphate rich sediments such as gypsum and anhydrite are the major sources for the groundwater in the study area and also confirmed by saturation index analyses higher concentrations of mg2 and ca2 in the groundwater were derived from the weathering of mg rich calcite and dolomite bearing sediments and ca mg rich silicates of rock forming minerals the combination of higher levels of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 concentrations in the groundwater suggests that the coupled reactions involving sulphide oxidation and carbonate dissolution which largely controls the solute acquisition processes in the study area singh et al 2007 a mineralogical analysis of gondwana sediments indicates that the dominance of coarse arkosic sandstones carbonaceous and grey shales fireclay and coal seams gsi 1963 the common feldspars are orthoclase and microcline which have the formula orthoclase kalsi3o8 and the plagioclase series ranging in composition from albite naalsi3o8 to anorthite caal2si2o8 minerals containing sodium and calcium are somewhat more susceptible to weathering and release the metal cation and silica to the groundwater hem 1989 3 3 hydrochemical facies the piper trilinear diagram piper 1944 was drawn for all the major ions which shows relative concentrations of each ions from individual water samples to illustrate the trends in the different geochemical characteristics and groundwater composition types prevailed in the study area and shown in fig 4 piper diagram shows two principal water types was prevailing such as ca mg cl followed by ca mg hco3 type the majority of the samples represented by mixed water type with no dominance hydrochemical facies the mixed water type facies in the study area indicates chemistry of groundwater are dominated by alkaline earths ca2 mg2 over the alkalies na k and dominance of weak acids hco3 over strong acids so4 2 cl the principal ca mg cl water type indicates the rock water interaction and dissolution of carbonates facies rocks by the recharging groundwater within the aquifer the presence of carbonaceous rocks such as shale coal and feldspathic sandstones at the shallow depths which aids the process of dissolution and will add significant amounts of ca2 and mg2 to the final groundwater composition greater amount of calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate in groundwater suggests calcite and gypsum are abundances during the weathering processes higher calcium concentrations in groundwater could be derived from the weathering of calcic rich rock forming minerals and thereby releasing more calcium ions into the final composition of groundwater hem 1989 in the present study area the rock types are dominated by sandstone shale and coal bearing sandstones which are the major source for contributing the calcium in groundwater 3 4 saturation indexes the saturation index for the groundwater samples were determined using usgs hydro geochemical model software of phreeqc for windows parkhurst and appelo 1999 the mineralogy and rock matrix in the aquifer plays significant role in determining chemical composition of ground water the saturation index si studies are carried out in hydrogeochemical studies to understand the approximate degree to which the groundwater has been equilibrium condition with the various mineral phases in the aquifer appelo and postma 2005 in coal bearing sediments several chemical reactions takes place and these reactions have a greater influence on the major dissolved constituents of ground and surface water williams and hammond 1988 the saturation index of mineral phases found to be less than zero groundwater is in under saturated state and still the ongoing process of mineral dissolution is in ongoing process while the saturation index found to be more than zero groundwater is oversaturated with that mineral phase the saturation indices and their summary statistics for the groundwater samples for the carbonate and sulphate mineral phases are presented in table 4a the phreeqc simulations of various mineral phases indicates most of the groundwater samples are near saturated to equilibrium conditions with the carbonate phase minerals of calcite caco3 and dolomite mgca co3 2 while undersaturated with gypsum caso4 2h2o and anhydrite caso4 for the speciation modeling two samples sl no 6 and 7 were selected from the major ions and trace elements the saturation indices for the selected mineral phases and the results in the range of 2 5 si 2 5 were shown presented in the table 4b the speciation analyses shows that fe mineral phases goethite hematite are supersaturated in the groundwater while the sulphate and carbonate bearing fe minerals melanterite and siderite are undersaturated with groundwater mn bearing mineral phases such as hausmannite pyrolusite and manganite are highly undersaturated state and near saturation to equilibrium state to the minerals rhodochrosite the saturation indices for these mineral phases shows precipitation unlikely to takes places in the groundwater wells in the present chemical equilibrium conditions saturation indices si analyse indicates groundwater compositions were understaurated conditions with respect to the secondary minerals of fe and mn sulphate and carbonate phases species this suggests the residence times of groundwater in the wells for a short period and unable to reach the natural equilibrium conditions with the secondary minerals phases bhattacharya et al 2012 3 5 rock water interaction geochemical reactions between groundwater and aquifer matrix influence the groundwater chemistry and are useful in understanding the origin of groundwater chemical compositions of groundwater and surface water are controlled by various mechanisms such as lithology nature of geochemical reactions rock weathering rate of supply of dissolved salts evaporation and marine salt spraying fractional crystallization of minerals in the aquifer and atmospheric precipitation of rainfalls in the surrounding environment gibbs 1970 a simple plot of total dissolved solids tds versus na na ca and cl cl hco3 will reveal information about the origin and source of dissolved ions and the processes controlling the groundwater chemistry in the present study both the gibbs plots fig 5 indicates chemical weathering of rock forming minerals and dissolution of carbonate phase minerals are the predominant hydrogeochemical processes which controls the chemistry of groundwater in aquifer 3 6 trace elements in groundwater in the present study trace elements concentrations were analyzed in the groundwater samples and also to evaluate their permissible limits for drinking water purposes barium ba concentrations in groundwater samples were found to be 9 98 65 μg l mean value of 31 54 μg l barium concentrations in ground water could be possible due to the discharge of drilling wastes due to the coal mining and dissolve and erosion of aquifer materials cadmium cd concentrations in groundwater samples were found to be below detection level 3 μg l cobalt co concentrations were found to be 1 02 5 54 μg l mean value of 3 14 μg l in the groundwater which is lower than the recommended values of 50 μg l chromium cr concentrations found to be 0 7 6 46 μg l mean value of 2 58 μg l in the groundwater samples which is lower than the guidelines value of 50 μg l who 2008 cupper cu concentrations were found to be 13 85 22 μg l mean value of 16 66 μg l in the groundwater which is lower than the recommended values of 50 μg l and having the similar values in all the samples iron fe concentrations were found to be 24 250 μg l mean value of 123 μg l in the groundwater which is lower than the guidelines value of 300 μg l manganese mn concentrations in groundwater were found to be in the range of 21 72 μg l mean value of 50 μg l which is lower than the recommended values of 100 μg l bis 2004 nickel ni concentrations were found to be 0 13 06 μg l mean value of 3 68 μg l which is lower than the recommended values of 20 μg l in groundwater system intensive pyrite oxidation in combination with carbonate dissolution results in lower ph conditions and that significantly mobilizes the nickel in water larsen and postma 1997 lead pb concentrations were found to be in the range of 0 μg l mean value of 7 8 μg l which is lower than the recommended values of 100 μg l zinc zn concentrations were found to be in the range of 11 179 μg l mean value of 54 μg l in the groundwater which is below the who guidelines value of 5000 μg l 3 7 impact of acid mine drainage amd the fe and mn were showing a little higher concentration than the other trace elements in the groundwater which could be attributed to the weathering of coal bearing sediments release of metals from black shales and iron bearing rocks such pyrite oxidation and iron hydroxides presence in the aquifer both fe and mn concentrations shows a very moderate correlation with so4 2 concentrations such as r2 0 27 for fe and r2 0 25 with mn respectively and shown fig 6a and b the precipitations of fe oxyhydroxides and mn oxyhydroxides explains the low correlation with the neutral to alkaline ph conditions in the present study all the samples show low fe mn and so4 2 concentrations and there is no adverse impact of amd on groundwater fe shows weak correlation with the ca r2 0 14 fig 6c this is shows signature of consistent removal of fe during neutralization of acid mine drainage amd by carbonates which are the source of ca bearing minerals mn shows positive correlations with ca r2 0 36 fig 6d and supports the hypothesis of mn carbonates as the major source of manganese in groundwater bhattacharya et al 2012 based on the near neutral ph values low level of so4 2 concentrations and trace elements in the rajrappa coal mining area the possibility of generation of acid mine drainage is negligible acid mine drainage neutralization takes place if carbonate bearing rocks present in the local stratigraphic sequence rocks as host rocks the attenuation of amd results from the increase in ph and decrease in the solubility of metals and strongly depends on the neutralizing mediums cravotta et al 1999 the chemical equilibrium conditions and the neutralization effect of acidic water also caused the precipitation of several metals in the fluvial sediments this suggests the residence times of groundwater in the wells are very short and unable to reach the natural equilibrium conditions with the secondary minerals phases bhattacharya et al 2012 the surface runoff of the region takes its natural course and flowing through the area into the surrounding streams which finally falls with bhera river during high base flow time impact of dilution takes place and significant neutralization takes place and diluting the mine drainage and acid generating streams in the coal mining areas 4 groundwater quality for drinking water purposes groundwater chemistry of the study area were presented in tables 1 and 2 and are compared with the drinking water quality parameters guideline values as recommended by bis 2004 and who 2008 in groundwater ph values 6 78 7 7 in pre monsoon and 7 3 8 0 in the post monsoon periods were found within safe limits as suggested by who 2008 values of ph 6 5 8 5 total dissolved solids tds concentrations of groundwater were less than the desirable limits of 500 mg l however two of the samples shows above the desirable limits of 500 mg l in both pre and post monsoon periods total hardness th value in one of the samples r2 exceeds in the post monsoon period of desirable limit up to 300 mg l and may be extended up to permissible limit of 600 mg l bis 2004 in the hardness category none of the samples falls under soft water 20 belongs to moderately hard 70 belongs to hard and the remaining 10 comprises very hard water sodium na and potassium k values in groundwater in both the seasons were found to be below the permissible limit of 200 mg l and 12 mg l respectively calcium ca2 concentrations were found to be within the permissible limit of 75 mg l however in sample locations r7 r8 in the pre monsoon period and r7 in the post monsoon period exceeds the permissible limit of 75 mg l in the location r2 the magnesium mg2 concentration was found to be 45 mg l which has been exceeding the permissible limits of 30 mg l bis 2004 magnesium concentrations in the samples from r4 in pre monsoon and r3 r5 r7 r8 and r10 in the post monsoon period exceeds the permissible limit of 45 mg l bis 2004 sulphate so4 2 and chcloride cl concentrations in the groundwater samples were found to be below the permissible limit of 200 mg l and 250 mg l bis 2004 respectively higher concentrations fluoride f were found in two groundwater samples r4 r10 in the pre monsoon and post monsoon period which are above permissible limit of 1 5 mg l bis 2004 the trace element concentrations in the groundwater sample do not shows any higher levels than the recommended values 5 conclusions the present study was explained on the basis of major ion chemistry trace elements concentrations bivariate plots hydrogeochemical characteristics and the possible influence of acid mine drainage amd on the groundwater resources in the rajrappa coal mining area groundwater chemistry in the area reveals that ph of water are near neutral to alkaline in nature tds concentrations varies from 150 to 620 mg l and moderately hard water in nature and are suitable for the drinking water purposes trace elements concentration in the groundwater does not exceed the standard permissible limits the principal water types such as ca mg cl and ca mg hco3 and abundance of calcium and magnesium levels in the groundwater indicates rock water interaction and the dissolution of carbonates phase minerals within the aquifer the hydrogeochemical evaluation indicates carbonate weathering cation exchange process in the aquifers controls the groundwater chemistry saturation indices si analyses indicates groundwater are near saturated to equilibrium conditions with carbonate phase minerals and unsaturated conditions with sulphate phase minerals trace elements such as fe and mn concentrations have a greater presence in the groundwater are possible due to the interaction groundwater with the geologic materials in the aquifer fe concentrations in the groundwater could be due to the weathering of geologic materials and iron bearing rocks such pyrite oxidation and iron hydroxides the speciation analyses show that groundwater supersaturated with respect to fe oxyhydroxides bearing mineral phases goethite hematite and undersaturated with respect to sulphate and carbonate bearing such as melanterite and siderite mn oxyhydroxides bearing mineral phases such as hausmannite pyrolusite and manganite are highly undersaturated state and near saturation to equilibrium state to the carbonate phase minerals rhodochrosite with groundwater respectively groundwater showing a little higher level of fe and mn concentration than the other traces elements in the wells both fe and mn concentrations shows a moderate correlation with so4 2 concentrations the precipitations of fe oxyhydroxides and mn oxyhydroxides likely takes place in groundwater with in the neutral to alkaline ph conditions the saturation of carbonate phase minerals which makes complexation with the fe and mn bearing minerals and neutralizing the metal generation activity in the groundwater based on the near neutral to alkaline ph values low level of so4 2 concentrations and trace elements in the rajrappa coal mining area indicates the generation of acid mine drainage was negligible due to presence of carbonate bearing local host rocks also have significant effect on the neutralization of acid mine drainage wicks and groves 1993 the residence time of groundwater in the wells are for very short period and unable to reach the natural equilibrium conditions with the secondary minerals phases that helps in neutralizing the medium to generate acid mine drainage in the coal mining area the short residence time of groundwater unable to dissolve metals makes negative saturation indices for the secondary minerals the surface runoff of the region takes its natural course and flowing through the area into the surrounding streams which finally falls with bhera river during high base flow time the impact of dilution and significant neutralization takes place which dilutes the mine drainage and acid generating streams in the coal mining areas for further investigations in the study area and more information about the geohydrological characteristics such as depth of the wells groundwater flow pattern aquifer characteristics surrounding streams lineaments features geological information of the coal bearing strata will provide adequate information and about the groundwater resources of the area the location of coal mining sites dumping of overburdens and release of leachates and contaminants from the coal washing plants and would provide a better understanding of the processes governing the groundwater composition in the coal mining regions this would make a more comprehensive assessment of the vulnerability of groundwater resources concerning to the coal mining operations in the region these results will help the policy makers local community and state groundwater boards to explore the drinking water wells safely from the aquifers of clean conditions these studies may significantly

12352,groundwater quality studies of coal mining areas are very important due to coal explorations dumping of huge quantity of over burdens and subsequently mixing with the coal mine drainage areas the main objective of this study was to evaluate the possible influence of acid mine drainage amd in the groundwater in terms of major ions trace elements and identifying the hydrogeochemical characteristics in the rajrappa coal mining area in the central part of india the results show that groundwater is generally neutral to alkaline in nature the major ions and trace elements concentrations in the groundwater samples were found to be below the permissible limits based on who guidelines and suitable for the drinking water purposes few wells show a higher order in certain parameters due to impact local geologic strata the piper diagram shows two major hydrochemical water types represents such as ca mg cl and ca mg hco3 types based on major ion concentrations and its minor variations are indicative of the stable geochemical and hydrologic environments which controls the groundwater chemistry in the coal mining area geochemical evolution of the groundwater chemistry mainly controls by the natural geochemical processes such as mineral dissolution rock water interactions and mineral precipitation processes saturation index studies show that groundwater samples were near saturation to equilibrium conditions with the carbonate phase minerals of calcite and dolomite and undersaturated with gypsum and anhydrite secondary minerals of fe and mn sulphate and carbonate phase species are in undersaturated conditions the shorter residence times of groundwater in the wells lack of acid mine drainage generating conditions and the impact of dilution during high base flows are diluting the coal mining drainage streams and making a negligible impact of acid mine drainage graphical abstract fx1 keywords hydrochemistry groundwater water quality trace elements acid mine drainage amd carbonate phase minerals rajrappa coal mines 1 introduction groundwater resources in coal mining areas are known to be vulnerable to pollution and that may have a serious impact on environment groundwater contaminations due to the coal mining operations are a worldwide problem younger 2004 cravotta 2008a wright et al 2017 depletion of groundwater quality acid water generation and mixing with the surrounding water release of heavy metals is a common phenomenon occurs in coal mining areas water contamination caused by acid mine drainage amd one of the well known sources of water pollution coal mining drainage cmd can be strongly affected by amd due to the interaction of water with the pyrite content in coal which can generate acidic water that leaches and mobilizes metals from the surrounding geology johnson 2003 the acidic water generated from the amd sources and corroded the country rock and releases additional metals contaminate the surrounding aquifer and adversely affect the groundwater resources for the domestic supply and consumption of the of the region coal mining drainage cmd are frequently enriched with sulfuric acid and heavy metals at higher levels which could contaminate the surrounding streams and aquifer in the region in coal mining areas the continuous influx and mixing of acid mine drainage amd with groundwater and surface water which gradually degraded and leads to lower ph value and that enhances the mobility of trace elements in the groundwater with high concentrations kleinman et al 1981 the mobility of trace elements further enhances due to movement of contaminated water in the aquifer through fractures and cracks in the rocks and also through the coal mine drainage networks cravotta 2005 coal mining operations generate huge quantities of solids due to over burden dumping and liquid wastes from the coal washing plants the untreated water releases from coal washing plants which contain higher levels of tss tds trace elements and which were acidic in nature and mixed with surface and groundwater of the surrounding area due to the uncontrolled discharge of solid and liquid wastes related to the coal mining operations and interacts with the aquifer and degrades the water resources of the region the groundwater contamination and environmental problems related to the coal mining areas in different parts of world were reported by several authors kim and chon 2001 younger 2001 johnson and hallberg 2005 goodarzi et al 2008 singh et al 2010 keskin 2013 zakir et al 2013 li et al 2013 alhamed and wohnlich 2014 cravotta 2015 cravotta and brady 2015 groundwater has been contacts with coal bearing sediments and also due to the influence of coal mining drainage with the surrounding aquifer in the area which leads to the enrichment of trace elements trace elements in groundwater primarily come from source rock and also from various anthropogenic activities the main threat comes from exposure of lead cadmium cobalt nickel mercury arsenic and other trace elements have been extensively studied and their effects on human health regularly reviewed in many authors larocqu and rasmussen 1998 usepa 2002 jarup 2003 who 2008 trace elements such as as co cd ni fe mn cu se pb and u are concentrated in coal bearing strata and released to the coal mine drainage cmd through various

mining area with the observation wells fig 2 2 3 water sampling and chemical analysis a total of 10 groundwater samples were collected from the study area for the water quality and hydrogeochemical studies during the pre monsoon period june 2011 and post monsoon periods january 2012 respectively groundwater samples were collected from the dug wells hand pumps in the surrounding village areas from 9 locations and one surface water sample was collected from the bhera river for the regular monitoring fig 1 the water levels from the ground level are varies from 1 3 to 6 5 m in pre monsoon period and 1 75 5 6 m in post monsoon period during the time of measurement the groundwater flow pattern is from northwestern towards southeastern side though the numerous streams and flow channels and finally falls on the bhera river groundwater sample analyses for major ions concentrations using the standard american public health association procedure apha 1995 and were carried out in the telengana state groundwater department hyderabad water sample locations with their physico chemical parameters and descriptive statistics for the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods and are presented in tables 1 and 2 the water quality parameters such as ph electrical conductivity ec and total dissolved solids tds were measured using a bench top meter adwa a8000 the ionic concentrations of cations such as na and k were analyzed by a flame photometer elico 370 ca2 mg2 hco3 and cl by classical volumetric method so4 2 by a spectro photometer no3 and f were analyzed using ion electrodes the ionic balance for all the analyses were found to be within a limit of less than 5 trace elements such as ba cd co cr cu fe mn ni pb zn were analyzed by using an icp oes perkinelmer optima 4300 dv at csir national geophysical research institute hyderabad for the trace metals analyses groundwater samples were filtered through a 0 45 µm filter paper and acidified by ultra pure nitric acid to maintain the ph level below 2 the multi elemental reference standard materials nist srm 1643e were used for the quality control purposes the reference standards and the duplicates were analyzed after every 10

elements concentrations were presented in table 5 piper diagrams and saturation index si values with respect to major ions for the groundwater samples were computed using aquachem software 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater chemistry results for the major ion concentrations for the groundwater samples n 9 and surface water n 1 in the study area along with their basic statistical summaries for the pre monsoon and post monsoon period are shown tables 1 and 2 respectively correlation matrixes for the major ions were evaluated to understand the relationships between different ionic species of groundwater samples for the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods table 3a 3b respectively the saturation indexes of carbonate phase minerals were calculated for the groundwater samples and shown in table 4 contributions of major ions in meq l of the groundwater samples are found to be as na 12 89 15 59 k 1 07 0 74 ca2 26 79 23 13 mg2 10 38 10 72 so4 2 11 76 9 01 no3 2 70 5 86 cl 16 95 14 49 f 0 50 0 56 hco3 16 96 19 91 in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively in groundwater ph varies from 6 78 to 7 7 mean value of 7 34 0 25 and 7 3 8 0 mean value of 7 56 0 21 for the pre monsoon and post monsoon period respectively the mean ph value in this area indicates water samples are neutral to slightly alkaline in nature electrical conductivity ec values of groundwater varies from 180 to 900 mean value of 568 218 μs cm and 391 969 mean value of 687 156 μs cm for the pre monsoon and post monsoon period respectively total dissolved solids tds ranges from 156 576 mg l mean value of 368 132 mg l and 250 620 mg l mean value of 440 100 mg l for the pre monsoon and post monsoon period respectively higher levels of ec and tds in the post monsoon period indicated higher mineralization and dissolution takes place in the groundwater the low tds concentrations are attributed to the shallow groundwater without much dissolution of rocks in the surrounding aquifer tds show strong positive correlation with ca2 r2 0 98 so4 2 r2 0 71 and cl r2 0 90 and moderate correlation r2 0 42 0 40 0 36 with na k and hco3 respectively for the pre monsoon period table 3a tds show positive correlation with ca2 r2 0 91 na r2 73 so4 2 r2 0 79 and cl r2 0 78 and moderate correlation r2 0 44 0 26 0 60 with k mg2 and no3 respectively for the post monsoon period table 3b sodium na concentrations ranges from 9 to 63 mg l mean value 38 21 mg l in the pre monsoon period and 19 78 mg l mean value 44 22 mg l in the post monsoon period potassium k concentration ranges from 4 to 8 mg l mean value 5 4 1 26 mg l and 1 8 mg l mean value 3 5 2 55 mg l for the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively although the concentration of potassium is high in the k feldspar bearing rocks and soils due to its low mobility in the hydrosphere k concentrations are low in the groundwater system calcium ca2 concentrations varies from 26 to 119 mean value 69 28 mg l and 30 82 mean value 57 13 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively magnesium mg2 concentrations in the groundwater range from 4 to 37 mg l mean value 16 9 mg l and 4 45 mg l mean value 16 12 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively the major source of calcium and magnesium in the groundwater is due to ion exchange of minerals in the aquifer sulphate so4 2 concentrations ranges from 9 to 124 mg l mean value of 73 35 mg l and 15 90 mg l mean value of 54 25 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively the lowest value of sulphate concentration was found in surface water sample from the bhera river nitrate no3 concentrations are varies from 6 29 to 52 mg l mean value of 22 13 mg l and 2 103 mg l mean value of 45 36 in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively higher nitrate concentrations 45 mg l found in few groundwater samples were found in the cattle farms complexes and release of domestic sewage from the septic tanks to the surrounding area also the applications of nitrogen fertilizers for the seasonal crops enhance the nitrate concentrations in groundwater chloride cl concentrations ranges from 26 to 158 mg l and mean value 78 45 mg l and 15 115 mg l and mean value of 64 34 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively the chloride cl concentrations in groundwater can be derived through the mixing of domestic wastewaters septic tanks and applications of chemical fertilizers hem 1989 appelo and postma 1996 fluoride f concentrations varies from 0 3 to 3 21 mg l mean value of 1 23 1 23 mg l and 0 41 3 17 mg l mean value of 1 31 0 97 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon period respectively the higher levels of f 1 5 mg l in few samples are due to the local enrichment of fluoride bearing ions in the groundwater the fluoride concentration in groundwater basically originates from the dissolution of fluoride bearing minerals high fluorine content in coal the rock water interaction and weathering of fluoride bearing minerals and rocks prolonged period of contact of groundwater with the host rock and also enters the surface waters through runoff fluoride mobility in water controlled by presence of as to a larger of extent of ca2 ions since fluoride forms low solubility compounds with divalent cations hem 1989 in groundwater bicarbonate hco3 concentrations ranges from 89 to 164 mg l mean value of 134 28 mg l and 65 198 mg l mean value of 150 36 mg l in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods respectively higher bicarbonate hco3 concentrations are indicative of carbonate weathering and local enrichment of decomposition of organic matter also bicarbonate concentrations in the groundwater could be enhanced due to the rock water interactions as evidenced by the relatively higher calcium and magnesium levels and bicarbonate concentration groundwater compositions that are primarily controlled by carbonate reactions will have relatively high calcium and magnesium and bicarbonate contents are attributed to the presence of calcite and dolomite stumm and morgan 1981 the carbonate co3 and bicarbonate hco3 concentrations in groundwater were principally attributed to the dissolution and weathering of carbonate phase minerals and dissolution of carbonic acid in the aquifers it is evident from the groundwater chemistry the minor variations are indicative of the stable geochemical and hydrologic environments which controlling the groundwater quality in the coal mining area 3 2 hydrogeochemical evaluation the scatter diagrams between different ions can reveal information about the origin and evolution solutes and about the hydrogeochemical processes control mechanism occurring in the aquifer edmunds et al 1987 the reactions between groundwater and the aquifer matrix can significantly control the water chemistry the cross plot between na vs cl in diagram fig 3a shows most of the sample points falls below the equiline and predominance of na ions over cl ions suggests addition of na ions released from the weathering of silicate minerals and ion exchange within the aquifer mayback 1987 the na vs ca2 scatter diagram fig 3b shows higher levels of calcium concentrations than sodium concentrations and also indicate the ion exchange reactions occurring in the aquifer which increases the ca2 concentrations in groundwater the scatter diagram of ca2 mg2 versus so4 2 hco3 shows most of the ionic concentrations falls above the equiline 1 1 and shown in fig 3c6 the points above the equiline indicates carbonate weathering where as points falling below the line represents mixed source such as carbonate weathering and silicate weathering datta and tyagi 1996 the scatter diagram of ca2 mg2 versus total cations plot fig 3d shows the data points falling near the equiline and ratio varies from 0 55 to 0 83 with an average equilibrium ratio of 0 68 at lower level of mineralization when the ratio approximates to 1 0 indicating these ions are the primary source for controlling the composition of the groundwater when the ca2 mg2 data deviates from the equiline 1 1 other cations na k contributes to the groundwater chemistry and reverse cation exchange takes place fisher and mullican 1997 the dissolution of carbonate phase minerals rock water interactions and ion exchange processes in the aquifer controls cations in the carbonate bearing rocks younger et al 2002 the ca2 and mg2 concentrations were derived from the dissolution of carbonate rich sediments such as calcite dolomite and sulphate rich sediments such as gypsum and anhydrite are the major sources for the groundwater in the study area and also confirmed by saturation index analyses higher concentrations of mg2 and ca2 in the groundwater were derived from the weathering of mg rich calcite and dolomite bearing sediments and ca mg rich silicates of rock forming minerals the combination of higher levels of ca2 mg2 hco3 and so4 2 concentrations in the groundwater suggests that the coupled reactions involving sulphide oxidation and carbonate dissolution which largely controls the solute acquisition processes in the study area singh et al 2007 a mineralogical analysis of gondwana sediments indicates that the dominance of coarse arkosic sandstones carbonaceous and grey shales fireclay and coal seams gsi 1963 the common feldspars are orthoclase and microcline which have the formula orthoclase kalsi3o8 and the plagioclase series ranging in composition from albite naalsi3o8 to anorthite caal2si2o8 minerals containing sodium and calcium are somewhat more susceptible to weathering and release the metal cation and silica to the groundwater hem 1989 3 3 hydrochemical facies the piper trilinear diagram piper 1944 was drawn for all the major ions which shows relative concentrations of each ions from individual water samples to illustrate the trends in the different geochemical characteristics and groundwater composition types prevailed in the study area and shown in fig 4 piper diagram shows two principal water types was prevailing such as ca mg cl followed by ca mg hco3 type the majority of the samples represented by mixed water type with no dominance hydrochemical facies the mixed water type facies in the study area indicates chemistry of groundwater are dominated by alkaline earths ca2 mg2 over the alkalies na k and dominance of weak acids hco3 over strong acids so4 2 cl the principal ca mg cl water type indicates the rock water interaction and dissolution of carbonates facies rocks by the recharging groundwater within the aquifer the presence of carbonaceous rocks such as shale coal and feldspathic sandstones at the shallow depths which aids the process of dissolution and will add significant amounts of ca2 and mg2 to the final groundwater composition greater amount of calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate in groundwater suggests calcite and gypsum are abundances during the weathering processes higher calcium concentrations in groundwater could be derived from the weathering of calcic rich rock forming minerals and thereby releasing more calcium ions into the final composition of groundwater hem 1989 in the present study area the rock types are dominated by sandstone shale and coal bearing sandstones which are the major source for contributing the calcium in groundwater 3 4 saturation indexes the saturation index for the groundwater samples were determined using usgs hydro geochemical model software of phreeqc for windows parkhurst and appelo 1999 the mineralogy and rock matrix in the aquifer plays significant role in determining chemical composition of ground water the saturation index si studies are carried out in hydrogeochemical studies to understand the approximate degree to which the groundwater has been equilibrium condition with the various mineral phases in the aquifer appelo and postma 2005 in coal bearing sediments several chemical reactions takes place and these reactions have a greater influence on the major dissolved constituents of ground and surface water williams and hammond 1988 the saturation index of mineral phases found to be less than zero groundwater is in under saturated state and still the ongoing process of mineral dissolution is in ongoing process while the saturation index found to be more than zero groundwater is oversaturated with that mineral phase the saturation indices and their summary statistics for the groundwater samples for the carbonate and sulphate mineral phases are presented in table 4a the phreeqc simulations of various mineral phases indicates most of the groundwater samples are near saturated to equilibrium conditions with the carbonate phase minerals of calcite caco3 and dolomite mgca co3 2 while undersaturated with gypsum caso4 2h2o and anhydrite caso4 for the speciation modeling two samples sl no 6 and 7 were selected from the major ions and trace elements the saturation indices for the selected mineral phases and the results in the range of 2 5 si 2 5 were shown presented in the table 4b the speciation analyses shows that fe mineral phases goethite hematite are supersaturated in the groundwater while the sulphate and carbonate bearing fe minerals melanterite and siderite are undersaturated with groundwater mn bearing mineral phases such as hausmannite pyrolusite and manganite are highly undersaturated state and near saturation to equilibrium state to the minerals rhodochrosite the saturation indices for these mineral phases shows precipitation unlikely to takes places in the groundwater wells in the present chemical equilibrium conditions saturation indices si analyse indicates groundwater compositions were understaurated conditions with respect to the secondary minerals of fe and mn sulphate and carbonate phases species this suggests the residence times of groundwater in the wells for a short period and unable to reach the natural equilibrium conditions with the secondary minerals phases bhattacharya et al 2012 3 5 rock water interaction geochemical reactions between groundwater and aquifer matrix influence the groundwater chemistry and are useful in understanding the origin of groundwater chemical compositions of groundwater and surface water are controlled by various mechanisms such as lithology nature of geochemical reactions rock weathering rate of supply of dissolved salts evaporation and marine salt spraying fractional crystallization of minerals in the aquifer and atmospheric precipitation of rainfalls in the surrounding environment gibbs 1970 a simple plot of total dissolved solids tds versus na na ca and cl cl hco3 will reveal information about the origin and source of dissolved ions and the processes controlling the groundwater chemistry in the present study both the gibbs plots fig 5 indicates chemical weathering of rock forming minerals and dissolution of carbonate phase minerals are the predominant hydrogeochemical processes which controls the chemistry of groundwater in aquifer 3 6 trace elements in groundwater in the present study trace elements concentrations were analyzed in the groundwater samples and also to evaluate their permissible limits for drinking water purposes barium ba concentrations in groundwater samples were found to be 9 98 65 μg l mean value of 31 54 μg l barium concentrations in ground water could be possible due to the discharge of drilling wastes due to the coal mining and dissolve and erosion of aquifer materials cadmium cd concentrations in groundwater samples were found to be below detection level 3 μg l cobalt co concentrations were found to be 1 02 5 54 μg l mean value of 3 14 μg l in the groundwater which is lower than the recommended values of 50 μg l chromium cr concentrations found to be 0 7 6 46 μg l mean value of 2 58 μg l in the groundwater samples which is lower than the guidelines value of 50 μg l who 2008 cupper cu concentrations were found to be 13 85 22 μg l mean value of 16 66 μg l in the groundwater which is lower than the recommended values of 50 μg l and having the similar values in all the samples iron fe concentrations were found to be 24 250 μg l mean value of 123 μg l in the groundwater which is lower than the guidelines value of 300 μg l manganese mn concentrations in groundwater were found to be in the range of 21 72 μg l mean value of 50 μg l which is lower than the recommended values of 100 μg l bis 2004 nickel ni concentrations were found to be 0 13 06 μg l mean value of 3 68 μg l which is lower than the recommended values of 20 μg l in groundwater system intensive pyrite oxidation in combination with carbonate dissolution results in lower ph conditions and that significantly mobilizes the nickel in water larsen and postma 1997 lead pb concentrations were found to be in the range of 0 μg l mean value of 7 8 μg l which is lower than the recommended values of 100 μg l zinc zn concentrations were found to be in the range of 11 179 μg l mean value of 54 μg l in the groundwater which is below the who guidelines value of 5000 μg l 3 7 impact of acid mine drainage amd the fe and mn were showing a little higher concentration than the other trace elements in the groundwater which could be attributed to the weathering of coal bearing sediments release of metals from black shales and iron bearing rocks such pyrite oxidation and iron hydroxides presence in the aquifer both fe and mn concentrations shows a very moderate correlation with so4 2 concentrations such as r2 0 27 for fe and r2 0 25 with mn respectively and shown fig 6a and b the precipitations of fe oxyhydroxides and mn oxyhydroxides explains the low correlation with the neutral to alkaline ph conditions in the present study all the samples show low fe mn and so4 2 concentrations and there is no adverse impact of amd on groundwater fe shows weak correlation with the ca r2 0 14 fig 6c this is shows signature of consistent removal of fe during neutralization of acid mine drainage amd by carbonates which are the source of ca bearing minerals mn shows positive correlations with ca r2 0 36 fig 6d and supports the hypothesis of mn carbonates as the major source of manganese in groundwater bhattacharya et al 2012 based on the near neutral ph values low level of so4 2 concentrations and trace elements in the rajrappa coal mining area the possibility of generation of acid mine drainage is negligible acid mine drainage neutralization takes place if carbonate bearing rocks present in the local stratigraphic sequence rocks as host rocks the attenuation of amd results from the increase in ph and decrease in the solubility of metals and strongly depends on the neutralizing mediums cravotta et al 1999 the chemical equilibrium conditions and the neutralization effect of acidic water also caused the precipitation of several metals in the fluvial sediments this suggests the residence times of groundwater in the wells are very short and unable to reach the natural equilibrium conditions with the secondary minerals phases bhattacharya et al 2012 the surface runoff of the region takes its natural course and flowing through the area into the surrounding streams which finally falls with bhera river during high base flow time impact of dilution takes place and significant neutralization takes place and diluting the mine drainage and acid generating streams in the coal mining areas 4 groundwater quality for drinking water purposes groundwater chemistry of the study area were presented in tables 1 and 2 and are compared with the drinking water quality parameters guideline values as recommended by bis 2004 and who 2008 in groundwater ph values 6 78 7 7 in pre monsoon and 7 3 8 0 in the post monsoon periods were found within safe limits as suggested by who 2008 values of ph 6 5 8 5 total dissolved solids tds concentrations of groundwater were less than the desirable limits of 500 mg l however two of the samples shows above the desirable limits of 500 mg l in both pre and post monsoon periods total hardness th value in one of the samples r2 exceeds in the post monsoon period of desirable limit up to 300 mg l and may be extended up to permissible limit of 600 mg l bis 2004 in the hardness category none of the samples falls under soft water 20 belongs to moderately hard 70 belongs to hard and the remaining 10 comprises very hard water sodium na and potassium k values in groundwater in both the seasons were found to be below the permissible limit of 200 mg l and 12 mg l respectively calcium ca2 concentrations were found to be within the permissible limit of 75 mg l however in sample locations r7 r8 in the pre monsoon period and r7 in the post monsoon period exceeds the permissible limit of 75 mg l in the location r2 the magnesium mg2 concentration was found to be 45 mg l which has been exceeding the permissible limits of 30 mg l bis 2004 magnesium concentrations in the samples from r4 in pre monsoon and r3 r5 r7 r8 and r10 in the post monsoon period exceeds the permissible limit of 45 mg l bis 2004 sulphate so4 2 and chcloride cl concentrations in the groundwater samples were found to be below the permissible limit of 200 mg l and 250 mg l bis 2004 respectively higher concentrations fluoride f were found in two groundwater samples r4 r10 in the pre monsoon and post monsoon period which are above permissible limit of 1 5 mg l bis 2004 the trace element concentrations in the groundwater sample do not shows any higher levels than the recommended values 5 conclusions the present study was explained on the basis of major ion chemistry trace elements concentrations bivariate plots hydrogeochemical characteristics and the possible influence of acid mine drainage amd on the groundwater resources in the rajrappa coal mining area groundwater chemistry in the area reveals that ph of water are near neutral to alkaline in nature tds concentrations varies from 150 to 620 mg l and moderately hard water in nature and are suitable for the drinking water purposes trace elements concentration in the groundwater does not exceed the standard permissible limits the principal water types such as ca mg cl and ca mg hco3 and abundance of calcium and magnesium levels in the groundwater indicates rock water interaction and the dissolution of carbonates phase minerals within the aquifer the hydrogeochemical evaluation indicates carbonate weathering cation exchange process in the aquifers controls the groundwater chemistry saturation indices si analyses indicates groundwater are near saturated to equilibrium conditions with carbonate phase minerals and unsaturated conditions with sulphate phase minerals trace elements such as fe and mn concentrations have a greater presence in the groundwater are possible due to the interaction groundwater with the geologic materials in the aquifer fe concentrations in the groundwater could be due to the weathering of geologic materials and iron bearing rocks such pyrite oxidation and iron hydroxides the speciation analyses show that groundwater supersaturated with respect to fe oxyhydroxides bearing mineral phases goethite hematite and undersaturated with respect to sulphate and carbonate bearing such as melanterite and siderite mn oxyhydroxides bearing mineral phases such as hausmannite pyrolusite and manganite are highly undersaturated state and near saturation to equilibrium state to the carbonate phase minerals rhodochrosite with groundwater respectively groundwater showing a little higher level of fe and mn concentration than the other traces elements in the wells both fe and mn concentrations shows a moderate correlation with so4 2 concentrations the precipitations of fe oxyhydroxides and mn oxyhydroxides likely takes place in groundwater with in the neutral to alkaline ph conditions the saturation of carbonate phase minerals which makes complexation with the fe and mn bearing minerals and neutralizing the metal generation activity in the groundwater based on the near neutral to alkaline ph values low level of so4 2 concentrations and trace elements in the rajrappa coal mining area indicates the generation of acid mine drainage was negligible due to presence of carbonate bearing local host rocks also have significant effect on the neutralization of acid mine drainage wicks and groves 1993 the residence time of groundwater in the wells are for very short period and unable to reach the natural equilibrium conditions with the secondary minerals phases that helps in neutralizing the medium to generate acid mine drainage in the coal mining area the short residence time of groundwater unable to dissolve metals makes negative saturation indices for the secondary minerals the surface runoff of the region takes its natural course and flowing through the area into the surrounding streams which finally falls with bhera river during high base flow time the impact of dilution and significant neutralization takes place which dilutes the mine drainage and acid generating streams in the coal mining areas for further investigations in the study area and more information about the geohydrological characteristics such as depth of the wells groundwater flow pattern aquifer characteristics surrounding streams lineaments features geological information of the coal bearing strata will provide adequate information and about the groundwater resources of the area the location of coal mining sites dumping of overburdens and release of leachates and contaminants from the coal washing plants and would provide a better understanding of the processes governing the groundwater composition in the coal mining regions this would make a more comprehensive assessment of the vulnerability of groundwater resources concerning to the coal mining operations in the region these results will help the policy makers local community and state groundwater boards to explore the drinking water wells safely from the aquifers of clean conditions these studies may significantly

12353,simulation optimization methods have increasingly been used to develop optimal solutions for a variety of groundwater remediation systems the feasibility of these approaches is often dependent on their simplicity in application and software accessibility therefore it is imperative to evaluate the applicability of a freely accessible and user friendly algorithm in the design of more robust groundwater remediation solutions in this study we present a coupled simulation optimization model with solving constraint integer program scip algorithm in designing of groundwater remediation procedure of a polluted aquifer the proposed method is illustrated by applying to a hypothetical groundwater problem the primary objective of optimization in this work was to minimize the total pumping volume of water from a confined aquifer subject to the state variable constraints such that the resulting decrease in hydraulic head and contaminant concentration in a set of control boreholes are within specified target levels borehole pumping rates were considered as decision variables of the optimization problem the results of two cases demonstrate that the scip algorithm has the ability to design a groundwater remediation system of a polluted aquifer with a high degree of accuracy results of the scip were compared to firefly algorithm fa and indicated potential gains in efficiency to identify robust and reliable groundwater remediation system graphical abstract fx1 keywords scip algorithm groundwater pollution simulation optimization remediation system 1 introduction management and restoration of groundwater quality is becoming increasingly important owing to environmental pollution that has intensified by ever growing population and climate change kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b falkenmark 2000 daniel and anton 2007 though prevention of groundwater contamination is indisputably preferable groundwater contamination incidences are inevitable in such a changing world in terms of industrialization mechanization and urbanization sustainability of groundwater resource depends among many other factors on applied remediation strategy therefore development of groundwater remediation methods and advancement in the existing approaches becames imperative for the past few decades researchers have focused on designing effective groundwater remediation solutions the use of conventional techniques such as pump and treat has become popular in restoring polluted aquifers where contaminated groundwater is pumped treated and released back into water systems sreekanth et al 2016 luo et al 2016 mategaonkar and eldho 2012 kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b the pump and treat pat method is often combined with an optimization algorithm to determine the optimal design based on specified objective in a best way possible without violating pre determined restrictions simulation optimization s o models have proven useful in the design process of an effective pat system luo et

programming technique is applied in designing of an optimal solution mathematical programming techniques such as linear programing mixed integer programming nonlinear programming dynamic programming

et al 2016 girbau llistuella et al 2015 berthold et al 2012 christou 2011 although the authors are not aware of any study that has applied scip in management of groundwater pollution its ability to provide optimal solution in most complex systems such as gas line and supply chain makes it a viable option to test its applicability in groundwater systems management in this study therefore an application of a simulation optimization approach coupled with scip algorithm in the design of groundwater pollution remediation problem is presented the study aims at determining the applicability of scip algorithm in solving groundwater pollution problem the study applies the developed methodology on a hypothetical contaminanted groundwater system adopted from kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b groundwater flow and contaminant transport simulation are employed to provide useful groundwater system information which is not otherwise available from a long term field study the simulated state variables hydraulic head and concentrations are used in the optimization algorithm to represent the physical groundwater system in this study groundwater state variables hydraulic head and concentrations are simulated using finite difference method fdm in modflow and mt3dms models respectively and the optimization is achieved using the scip optimization algorithm in the opti toolbox interface in matlab 2 methodology the study applies the s o approach to design the remediation solution for a polluted groundwater system simulation models are used to represent the groundwater physical process within the optimization model the aquifer response generated by the simulation models contaminant concentration and hydraulic head are treated as input variable in the optimization

response to the applied stimuli in this case pumping of contaminated water from the polluted aquifer the proposed methodology incorporates contaminants and head constraints as controlling variables in the optimization based decision model therefore any feasible solution of the optimization model needs to satisfy the water head and concentration requirements two cases with different objectives and pumping wells number see sections 4 2 and 4 3 are considered in determining the performance of the adopted methodology in remediation of a polluted homogeneous confined groundwater aquifer 2 1 simulation model the simulation models used in this s o approach represent the aquifer state equality constraint in the optimization formulation zhao et al 2016 sreekanth et al 2016 mategaonkar and

on the change in hydrological state variables das and datta 2001 ayvaz and karahan 2008 2 2 optimization model in this study the solving constraint integer programs scip was adopted as optimization algorithm the optimization problem was constructed with the help of opti toolbox in matlab and solved using scip algorithm scip was used to solve the optimization problem with an objective of minimizing the total pumping rate at the designated pumping wells for treating the polluted aquifer the optimization model was solved such that the pumping rate at each of the wells is the decision variable of the remediation problem however any feasible solution should satisfy the concentration and water head lift requirements therefore contaminant concentration and aquifer head lift requirements are set in as constraints of the objective function 2 3 theoretical model formulations a two dimensional numerical model modflow harbaugh et al 2000 was used to simulate the groundwater flow in the polluted aquifer the governing equation describing the flow in a two dimensional transient isotropic confined aquifer is given as follows mondal et al 2010 1 2 h x 2 2 h y 2 q i δ x x i k

programming algorithm gamrath et al 2016 scip was developed in 2002 by achterbergas wing from soplex and sip achterberg 2009 it is a very competitive and fastest non commercial standalone solver for mixed integer programs berthold et al 2012 vigerske and gleixner 2016 it is a branch cut and price framework for mip minlp and cp berthold et al 2012 the design of scip is based on the notion of constraints supporting about 26 constraint types berthold et al 2012 for integrality linear nonlinear logical combinatorial and many other constraints the constraint handlers together with the domains of the variables define the space of feasible solutions this allows the algorithm to be able to decide whether a given solution is feasible for all constraints of its type to speed up the solution process scip provides if needed supplementary algorithms like constraint specific presolving domain propagation separation methods or a linear representation of its constraints additional plugins such as branching rules propagators and primal heuristics allow for an efficient solution process altogether in addition it gives the user power to constrain the solution based on the management preference by a variety of parameters berthold et al 2012 scip is the combination of the mip and cp solver to form a constraint mixed integer solver a mixed integer program applied in this study is defined as mip a b c i given a matrix a br m n vectors b r m and c r n and a set i n 1 n therefore the scip solve the mip with the equation as described in achterberg 2009 as 11 mip c min c t x ax b x r n x j zforallj i with objective function c t constraint matrix a and right hand side b the vectors in the set x mip x r n ax b x j zforallj i are called feasible solutions of mip a feasible solution x x mip of mip is called optimal if its objective value satisfies c t x c the bounds of the variables are denoted by l j x j u j with l j u j r formally they are part of the constraint system represented as a

n ax b is the set of feasible solutions of the lp relaxation an lp feasible solution x x lp is called lp optimal if c t x c while the constraint program as an arbitrary objective function of c x arbitrary constraint and variable domain usually infinite 13 cp c min c x x f x j zforallj i combining the two solver scip is defined as gamrath et al 2016 berthold et al 2012 14 scip c min c t x x f x r n x j zforallj i 3 description of the aquifer system hypothetical example of a polluted groundwater aquifer found in literature kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b sharief et al 2012 chang et al 2012 was adopted a 150 by 300 m hypothetical confined homogeneous aquifer was used in this set of experiments a schematic description of the hypothetical contaminated aquifer considered for the case study is given in fig 1 the ground surface from the bottom of the aquifer was assumed to be 70 m direction of groundwater flow is towards the right boundary which was maintained with a general head boundary of 60 m on the left and 57 m on the right boundary fig 1 the details of the aquifer parameters are given in table 1 for simulation of flow and transport regular centred block grids were used to describe the aquifer in total the area has 800 grids time step of 6 months was used and a simulation period of 28 years 20 years generation of plume and 8 year for remediation in total was applied fig 1 shows the flow direction dimensions and orientation of the considered domain simulation began with development of a plume assuming a source that was a disposal pond discharging 120 g m 3 for a 20 years period initially the entire aquifer domain was assumed to be uncontaminated c 0 the plume emanates from a continuous source and was principally dispersed by groundwater flow imposed by constant head boundary conditions on the left and right boundaries of the aquifer parallel to the flow direction the concentration distribution after 20 years is shown in fig 2 the left and right constant head boundaries provided initial heads for the transient simulation at the end of the 20 years period the source was removed and pumping for remediation mobilized from assigned pumping wells 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical setup the application of s o in conjunction with scip was tested on two hypothetical cases in the first case the verification of the proposed method was performed by solving pollution problem using 6 pumping wells for this case it was assumed that the numbers and locations of the pumping wells are known and the main goal was to obtain the optimal pumping rate in each of the wells for different remediation time in the second case the optimal remediation time was considered as a design variable therefore the objective was to determine the pumping rates for each of the wells and optimal remediation time from the polluted homogeneous aquifer system for both cases the pollution source releases a typical conservative pollutant during the active release periods the groundwater system had a transient simulation condition it was also assumed that the flow system had no uncertainty and all initial and boundary conditions as well as the length of release periods were known 4 2 case 1 minimization of total pumping rate in this case a confined aquifer was considered with constant hydraulic head boundaries assigned on the left hl 60 m and right hr 57 m resulting into left to right groundwater flow fig 1 no groundwater flow and zero concentration gradient were considered on the northern and southern boundaries of the aquifer fig 1 the contaminant was assumed to disperse for 20 years and then removed the contaminant plume after 20 years is shown in fig 2 the initial peak concentration was 120 g m 3 120 mg l and allowable concentration c max was 0 5 g m 3 in all cells the minimum head anywhere in the aquifer was to be greater than 5 m the lower and upper bounds on the pumping rates were chosen as 0 and 500 m 3 day six remediation pumping wells determined based on groundwater flow direction and contaminant source location were adopted from kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b location of remediation wells were assumed in cells row column pw1 10 7 pw2 10 10 pw3 10 13 pw4 10 16 pw5 10 19 and pw6 10 22 the study objective was to minimize the total pumping rates from the proposed remediation wells while meeting water quality and hydraulic head requirements the remediation time number and locations of wells were presumed fixed and only pumping rates were optimized the considered objective function and constraints were formulated as expressed in eqn 15 through 19 as follows 15 minimize f e 1 m q q e subject to 16 c o t i c max for o 1 n 17 h min h o t i for o 1 n 18 q min q e q max for e 1 m q 19 e 1 m q q e q tot where f is the objective function q e denotes the pumping rate of well e m q is the number of pumping wells considered for remediation c o t i and h o t i are contaminant concentration and head at cell o respectively n is the number of observation points c max and h min are the maximum allowable contaminant concentration and minimum allowable head in the monitoring cells respectively the contaminant constraint eq 16 ensures that the water quality requirement will be met in all monitoring points at the end of the remediation period however pumping should not lower the head below the minimum allowable groundwater head h min eq 17 neither exceed the minimum allowable treatment capacity q tot eq 19 q min and q max represent lower and upper bound of pumping rate for each pump respectively table 2 illustrates optimization and constraint parameters used in this case the concentration and head constraint equations were formulated in terms of decision variables pumping rates and influence coefficient as a result of pumping from the proposed remediation wells in a response matrix form the concentration in the aquifer is expressed as background concentration without pumping less the removed mass contaminant due to pumping times optimal pumping rate from the remediation wells therefore the concentration at any point o in the aquifer at t i time c o t i is the function of background concentration α o 0 and influence coefficient per unit stimuli non optimal pumping times the pumping rate at respective wells q e thus the concentration response eq 20 was as follow 20 c o t i α o 0 e m q α o e 1 q e e m q α o e 2 q e 2 for o 1 n e 1 m q eq 20 was represented in the optimization model as the concentration response matrix as follow 21 c 1 t i c 2 t i c n t i α 1 0 α 2 0 α n 0 α 11 1

2 β nm q t i q 1 q 2 q m q to evaluate the performance of the scip in designing of effective remediation system obtained results were compared with result from a similar case by kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b solved using firefly algorithms fa table 3 represent the comparison results summary of the two study comparing the results by scip with those by fa a number of observations were made the convergence graphs for the two algorithms are plotted in fig 3 it can be seen that the pumping rate decreases with increasing time further remediation time cannot be less than 1 year at 323 m3 day in this problem otherwise the constraints would no longer be satisfied summarized results given in table 3 show good agreement for 1 year remediation time significant drop of total pumping rate is observed in 2 years for scip algorithm compared to fa in general scip approach resulted in less total pumping rate than fa this can be explained by the scip convergence speed powered by incorporated supplementary algorithms like constraint specific presolving domain propagation and its additional plugins such as branching rules that work to speed up the process and obtain global optimal solution total volume of contaminated water needed to be pumped from the aquifer per remediation time is represented in fig 4 the volume increases with increase in total remediation time before dropping at remediation time above 6 years this is because the more time pollutant remains in the aquifer the further it spreads contaminating more water in the aquifer hence more water needs to be pumped out though contaminant concentration can be low due to the dilution effect of the groundwater system which explain the dropping of total volume pumped the pumping rate obtained by scip algorithm satisfied both water quality and water head requirements fig 5 present the minimum water head after remediation for different remediation period it can be observed from fig 5 that minimum water head increases rapidly from 1 to 2 5 years remediation period and there after a gradual trend is observed however water head was not significantly affected by pumping with a maximum draw down of 3 4 m at pw4 this is due to presence of general head boundary on the left and right of the model domain that kept the water flowing in to recover the water table fig 6 shows maximum contaminants concentration observed after every remediation time in contrast maximum contaminant concentration decreases with time for the considered period of 8 years concentration was below 0 5 g m3 at all time fig 6 4 3 case 2 minimization of total pumping rate and remediation time in this case aquifer with the same properties as the one in case 1 was considered contaminant was assumed to be dispersed for 20 years with the initial peak concentration of 120 g m3 injected and then removed five boreholes were considered for remediation fig 7 the number and location of the boreholes were fixed and only the pumping rate of each well and the total remediation time were determined the minimum pumping rate q min for all the wells was set to be 10 m3 day the maximum concentration c max of 0 01 g m3 was expected to be attained at all points for the optimal design of remediation time other constraints remains the same as in table 2 the main objective was to minimize the total pumping from the proposed five remediation wells and time required to remove the polluted water concentration and head constraints were embedded to ensure that optimal solution will meet water quality and head requirements the objective function was as follows 25 minimize y e 1 m q q e t the concentration at any point o is given as the function of mass removed due to pumping and pumping time t as follows 26 c o α o 0 e m q α o e 1 q e t e m q α o e 2 q e 2 t for o 1 n e 1 m q thus the concentration matrix with n observation points and m q pumping wells can be expressed as 27 c 1 c 2 c n α 1 0 α 2 0 α n 0 α 11 1 α 12 1 α

results for case 2 implied that with five pumping wells the most optimal pumping strategy satisfying the constraints regarding contaminant concentration and water head is to use pumps with total pumping rate of 117 76 m 3 day for 2147 days 5 88 years the optimized pumping rates of each specific pump by scip obtained in this study and fa according to kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b are also presented in table 4 the result of this remediation strategy reduces the pollutant concentration to 0 005 g m 3 by scip while fa resulted in lower value of 0 0024 g m3 the total pumping rate for scip was comparable with that of fa however optimal remediation time was less for scip fig 8 illustrate optimal pumping rate for each specific remediation well optimized using the fa and scip wells pw1 pw4 and pw5 were pumped at lower pumping rate compared to others fa methods pumped more on pw3 than scip while marginal difference is observed on pw2 fig 8 despite the fact that both methods gave comparable results on total pumping rate table 4 pumping distribution was slightly different fig 9 generally scip gave a better solution at a shorter time than fa the performance of scip may be related to the operation rules of the algorithms while fa operates on basis of attractiveness which is greatly affected by the distance between the two fireflies kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a scip is velocity based which allow it to quickly arrive at the global optimal solution achterberg 2009 5 conclusion remarks the importance of groundwater for sustainable development can not be over emphasised with the increase water demand for human social and development activities and escalating challenges on surface sources pollution drought climate change the future of sustainable water supply in many semi arid areas is now shifting from surface water sources to groundwater sources over the last two decade interest in optimal design of groundwater management systems for sustainable use of the resource has increased different approaches have been employed in solving challenges facing groundwater pollution management these approaches have had their strength challenges and weakness depending on the nature of the cause and complexity of the groundwater system however more work remains before an efficient and robust solution for groundwater pollution remediation problem is realized this study focused on exploring the applicability of scip in solving groundwater remediation problems in conjunction with simulation models the results obtained from the proposed approach indicated that the optimal pumping rate for the proposed pumping wells met water quality and water head requirements the performance of scip was qualitatively compared with that of fa and the results from scip were comparable to those of fa results from scip were in agreement with fa in most cases or giving even less total pumping rate than that by fa these findings suggest that scip in conjunction with s o model is capable of solving groundwater pollution problem and ensure its future sustainability in water supply there are more advantages of scip over other conventional methods including algorithmic simplicity and easiness of implementation thus it can be concluded that there is a potential on using scip in conjunction with the simulation optimization models to design an effective groundwater remediation system acknowledgments this research was funded by tshwane university of technology south africa 
12353,simulation optimization methods have increasingly been used to develop optimal solutions for a variety of groundwater remediation systems the feasibility of these approaches is often dependent

minimizing the total pumping rate at the designated pumping wells for treating the polluted aquifer the optimization model was solved such that the pumping rate at each of the wells is the decision variable of the remediation problem however any feasible solution should satisfy the concentration and water head lift requirements therefore contaminant concentration and aquifer head lift requirements are set in as constraints of the objective function 2 3 theoretical model formulations a two dimensional numerical model modflow harbaugh et al 2000 was used to simulate the groundwater flow in the polluted aquifer the governing equation describing the flow in a two dimensional transient isotropic confined aquifer is given as follows mondal et al 2010 1 2 h x 2 2 h y 2 q i δ x x i k

programming algorithm gamrath et al 2016 scip was developed in 2002 by achterbergas wing from soplex and sip achterberg 2009 it is a very competitive and fastest non commercial standalone solver for mixed integer programs berthold et al 2012 vigerske and gleixner 2016 it is a branch cut and price framework for mip minlp and cp berthold et al 2012 the design of scip is based on the notion of constraints supporting about 26 constraint types berthold et al 2012 for integrality linear nonlinear logical combinatorial and many other constraints the constraint handlers together with the domains of the variables define the space of feasible solutions this allows the algorithm to be able to decide whether a given solution is feasible for all constraints of its type to speed up the solution process scip provides if needed supplementary algorithms like constraint specific presolving domain propagation separation methods or a linear representation of its constraints additional plugins such as branching rules propagators and primal heuristics allow for an efficient solution process altogether in addition it gives the user power to constrain the solution based on the management preference by a variety of parameters berthold et al 2012 scip is the combination of the mip and cp solver to form a constraint mixed integer solver a mixed integer program applied in this study is defined as mip a b c i given a matrix a br m n vectors b r m and c r n and a set i n 1 n therefore the scip solve the mip with the equation as described in achterberg 2009 as 11 mip c min c t x ax b x r n x j zforallj i with objective function c t constraint matrix a and right hand side b the vectors in the set x mip x r n ax b x j zforallj i are called feasible solutions of mip a feasible solution x x mip of mip is called optimal if its objective value satisfies c t x c the bounds of the variables are denoted by l j x j u j with l j u j r formally they are part of the constraint system represented as a x b but in practice they are treated outside the coefficient matrix removing the integrality restrictions from an mip we obtain its lp relaxation achterberg 2009 12 lp c min c t x ax b x r n x l p x r n ax b is the set of feasible solutions of the lp relaxation an lp feasible solution x x lp is called lp optimal if c t x c while the constraint program as an arbitrary objective function of c x arbitrary constraint and variable domain usually infinite 13 cp c min c x x f x j zforallj i combining the two solver scip is defined as gamrath et al 2016 berthold et al 2012 14 scip c min c t x x f x r n x j zforallj i 3 description of the aquifer system hypothetical example of a polluted groundwater aquifer found in literature kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b sharief et al 2012 chang et al 2012 was adopted a 150 by 300 m hypothetical confined homogeneous aquifer was used in this set of experiments a schematic description of the hypothetical contaminated aquifer considered for the case study is given in fig 1 the ground surface from the bottom of the aquifer was assumed to be 70 m direction of groundwater flow is towards the right boundary which was maintained with a general head boundary of 60 m on the left and 57 m on the right boundary fig 1 the details of the aquifer parameters are given in table 1 for simulation of flow and transport regular centred block grids were used to describe the aquifer in total the area has 800 grids time step of 6 months was used and a simulation period of 28 years 20 years generation of plume and 8 year for remediation in total was applied fig 1 shows the flow direction dimensions and orientation of the considered domain simulation began with development of a plume assuming a source that was a disposal pond discharging 120 g m 3 for a 20 years period initially the entire aquifer domain was assumed to be uncontaminated c 0 the plume emanates from a continuous source and was principally dispersed by groundwater flow imposed by constant head boundary conditions on the left and right boundaries of the aquifer parallel to the flow direction the concentration distribution after 20 years is shown in fig 2 the left and right constant head boundaries provided initial heads for the transient simulation at the end of the 20 years period the source was removed and pumping for remediation mobilized from assigned pumping wells 4 results and discussion 4 1 numerical setup the application of s o in conjunction with scip was tested on two hypothetical cases in the first case the verification of the proposed method was performed by solving pollution problem using 6 pumping wells for this case it was assumed that the numbers and locations of the pumping wells are known and the main goal was to obtain the optimal pumping rate in each of the wells for different remediation time in the second case the optimal remediation time was considered as a design variable therefore the objective was to determine the pumping rates for each of the wells and optimal remediation time from the polluted homogeneous aquifer system for both cases the pollution source releases a typical conservative pollutant during the active release periods the groundwater system had a transient simulation condition it was also assumed that the flow system had no uncertainty and all initial and boundary conditions as well as the length of release periods were known 4 2 case 1 minimization of total pumping rate in this case a confined aquifer was considered with constant hydraulic head boundaries assigned on the left hl 60 m and right hr 57 m resulting into left to right groundwater flow fig 1 no groundwater flow and zero concentration gradient were considered on the northern and southern boundaries of the aquifer fig 1 the contaminant was assumed to disperse for 20 years and then removed the contaminant plume after 20 years is shown in fig 2 the initial peak concentration was 120 g m 3 120 mg l and allowable concentration c max was 0 5 g m 3 in all cells the minimum head anywhere in the aquifer was to be greater than 5 m the lower and upper bounds on the pumping rates were chosen as 0 and 500 m 3 day six remediation pumping wells determined based on groundwater flow direction and contaminant source location were adopted from kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b location of remediation wells were assumed in cells row column pw1 10 7 pw2 10 10 pw3 10 13 pw4 10 16 pw5 10 19 and pw6 10 22 the study objective was to minimize the total pumping rates from the proposed remediation wells while meeting water quality and hydraulic head requirements the remediation time number and locations of wells were presumed fixed and only pumping rates were optimized the considered objective function and constraints were formulated as expressed in eqn 15 through 19 as follows 15 minimize f e 1 m q q e subject to 16 c o t i c max for o 1 n 17 h min h o t i for o 1 n 18 q min q e q max for e 1 m q 19 e 1 m q q e q tot where f is the objective function q e denotes the pumping rate of well e m q is the number of pumping wells considered for remediation c o t i and h o t i are contaminant concentration and head at cell o respectively n is the number of observation points c max and h min are the maximum allowable contaminant concentration and minimum allowable head in the monitoring cells respectively the contaminant constraint eq 16 ensures that the water quality requirement will be met in all monitoring points at the end of the remediation period however pumping should not lower the head below the minimum allowable groundwater head h min eq 17 neither exceed the minimum allowable treatment capacity q tot eq 19 q min and q max represent lower and upper bound of pumping rate for each pump respectively table 2 illustrates optimization and constraint parameters used in this case the concentration and head constraint equations were formulated in terms of decision variables pumping rates and influence coefficient as a result of pumping from the proposed remediation wells in a response matrix form the concentration in the aquifer is expressed as background concentration without pumping less the removed mass contaminant due to pumping times optimal pumping rate from the remediation wells therefore the concentration at any point o in the aquifer at t i time c o t i is the function of background concentration α o 0 and influence coefficient per unit stimuli non optimal pumping times the pumping rate at respective wells q e thus the concentration response eq 20 was as follow 20 c o t i α o 0 e m q α o e 1 q e e m q α o e 2 q e 2 for o 1 n e 1 m q eq 20 was represented in the optimization model as the concentration response matrix as follow 21 c 1 t i c 2 t i c n t i α 1 0 α 2 0 α n 0 α 11 1

point was derived as equal to the background head at time t i without pumping less the sum of draw down due to pumping from the remediation wells m q in previous management era me i eq 22 22 h o t i h o t i non k 1 t i e 1 m q δ o e t i k s τ i ψ q q e k ut ic β o e k q e k τ i t i me i for simplicity β o e k was used to represent the influence coefficient term of eq 22 therefore the hydraulic equation can be rewritten as 23 h o t i h o t i non k 1 t i e 1 m q β o e k q e k t i me i and its matrix form is as follows 24 h 1 t i h 2 t i h n t i h 1 t i non h 2 t i non h n t i non β 111 β 112

2 β nm q t i q 1 q 2 q m q to evaluate the performance of the scip in designing of effective remediation system obtained results were compared with result from a similar case by kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b solved using firefly algorithms fa table 3 represent the comparison results summary of the two study comparing the results by scip with those by fa a number of observations were made the convergence graphs for the two algorithms are plotted in fig 3 it can be seen that the pumping rate decreases with increasing time further remediation time cannot be less than 1 year at 323 m3 day in this problem otherwise the constraints would no longer be satisfied summarized results given in table 3 show good agreement for 1 year remediation time significant drop of total pumping rate is observed in 2 years for scip algorithm compared to fa in general scip approach resulted in less total pumping rate than fa this can be explained by the scip convergence speed powered by incorporated supplementary algorithms like constraint specific presolving domain propagation and its additional plugins such as branching rules that work to speed up the process and obtain global optimal solution total volume of contaminated water needed to be pumped from the aquifer per remediation time is represented in fig 4 the volume increases with increase in total remediation time before dropping at remediation time above 6 years this is because the more time pollutant remains in the aquifer the further it spreads contaminating more water in the aquifer hence more water needs to be pumped out though contaminant concentration can be low due to the dilution effect of the groundwater system which explain the dropping of total volume pumped the pumping rate obtained by scip algorithm satisfied both water quality and water head requirements fig 5 present the minimum water head after remediation for different remediation period it can be observed from fig 5 that minimum water head increases rapidly from 1 to 2 5 years remediation period and there after a gradual trend is observed however water head was not significantly affected by pumping with a maximum draw down of 3 4 m at pw4 this is due to presence of general head boundary on the left and right of the model domain that kept the water flowing in to recover the water table fig 6 shows maximum contaminants concentration observed after every remediation time in contrast maximum contaminant concentration decreases with time for the considered period of 8 years concentration was below 0 5 g m3 at all time fig 6 4 3 case 2 minimization of total pumping rate and remediation time in this case aquifer with the same properties as the one in case 1 was considered contaminant was assumed to be dispersed for 20 years with the initial peak concentration of 120 g m3 injected and then removed five boreholes were considered for remediation fig 7 the number and location of the boreholes were fixed and only the pumping rate of each well and the total remediation time were determined the minimum pumping rate q min for all the wells was set to be 10 m3 day the maximum concentration c max of 0 01 g m3 was expected to be attained at all points for the optimal design of remediation time other constraints remains the same as in table 2 the main objective was to minimize the total pumping from the proposed five remediation wells and time required to remove the polluted water concentration and head constraints were embedded to ensure that optimal solution will meet water quality and head requirements the objective function was as follows 25 minimize y e 1 m q q e t the concentration at any point o is given as the function of mass removed due to pumping and pumping time t as follows 26 c o α o 0 e m q α o e 1 q e t e m q α o e 2 q e 2 t for o 1 n e 1 m q thus the concentration matrix with n observation points and m q pumping wells can be expressed as 27 c 1 c 2 c n α 1 0 α 2 0 α n 0 α 11 1 α 12 1 α

results for case 2 implied that with five pumping wells the most optimal pumping strategy satisfying the constraints regarding contaminant concentration and water head is to use pumps with total pumping rate of 117 76 m 3 day for 2147 days 5 88 years the optimized pumping rates of each specific pump by scip obtained in this study and fa according to kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015b are also presented in table 4 the result of this remediation strategy reduces the pollutant concentration to 0 005 g m 3 by scip while fa resulted in lower value of 0 0024 g m3 the total pumping rate for scip was comparable with that of fa however optimal remediation time was less for scip fig 8 illustrate optimal pumping rate for each specific remediation well optimized using the fa and scip wells pw1 pw4 and pw5 were pumped at lower pumping rate compared to others fa methods pumped more on pw3 than scip while marginal difference is observed on pw2 fig 8 despite the fact that both methods gave comparable results on total pumping rate table 4 pumping distribution was slightly different fig 9 generally scip gave a better solution at a shorter time than fa the performance of scip may be related to the operation rules of the algorithms while fa operates on basis of attractiveness which is greatly affected by the distance between the two fireflies kazemzadeh parsi et al 2015a scip is velocity based which allow it to quickly arrive at the global optimal solution achterberg 2009 5 conclusion remarks the importance of groundwater for sustainable development can not be over emphasised with the increase water demand for human social and development activities and escalating challenges on surface sources pollution drought climate change the future of sustainable water supply in many semi arid areas is now shifting from surface water sources to groundwater sources over the last two decade interest in optimal design of groundwater management systems for sustainable use of the resource has increased different approaches have been employed in solving challenges facing groundwater pollution management these approaches have had their strength challenges and weakness depending on the nature of the cause and complexity of the groundwater system however more work remains before an efficient and robust solution for groundwater pollution remediation problem is realized this study focused on exploring the applicability of scip in solving groundwater remediation problems in conjunction with simulation models the results obtained from the proposed approach indicated that the optimal pumping rate for the proposed pumping wells met water quality and water head requirements the performance of scip was qualitatively compared with that of fa and the results from scip were comparable to those of fa results from scip were in agreement with fa in most cases or giving even less total pumping rate than that by fa these findings suggest that scip in conjunction with s o model is capable of solving groundwater pollution problem and ensure its future sustainability in water supply there are more advantages of scip over other conventional methods including algorithmic simplicity and easiness of implementation thus it can be concluded that there is a potential on using scip in conjunction with the simulation optimization models to design an effective groundwater

12354,the present study aims to identify and analyze factors responsible for the discontinuity of irrigation tanks and the declining groundwater levels in the indian state of west bengal and attempts to establish the link between age old water harvesting structures such as tanks surface water and groundwater recharge using district level secondary data from 1992 to 2011 a fixed effect and dynamic panel regression models have been estimated in order to identify the determinants of the performance of irrigation tanks and the decline of groundwater levels respectively the results indicate that while the average annual rainfall positively influences the performance of irrigation tanks the mechanization of the farms the density of the wells increased rural population and per capita income adversely affect the performance of tanks the results of the determinants of the decline of groundwater levels show that while the average annual rainfall density of tanks and forest cover are likely to influence groundwater levels positively the density of wells is found to be adversely affecting the groundwater levels in the state the interaction between tank irrigation surface water and groundwater levels is found to be strong hence both tank irrigation and well irrigation should be used as complementary methods rather than substitutes in order to maintain a hydrological balance and use and manage water resources sustainably in the long run graphical abstract fx1 keywords traditional water harvesting structure groundwater tank degradation tank irrigation west bengal 1 introduction sustainable management and the use of water resources is critical for the overall development of human society in this context it is important to understand the dynamic and complex links between groundwater and surface water and their interactions this interaction takes place through physical linkage and the hydraulic connectivity of water among rivers wetlands tanks and surrounding catchments surface lateral flow and infiltration or exfiltration enhance the interaction between surface water and groundwater sophocleous 2002 von brömssen et al 2014 these groundwater and surface water interaction processes depend on the magnitude of the recharge and antecedent of soil moisture and aquifer conditions wood et al 1990 biswas et al 2017 in drought prone regions tanks are dug to harvest rainwater and are often used for percolation to recharge groundwater reddy and behera 2009 degradation of tanks and the encroachments of their catchment areas can disconnect the link between surface and groundwater resulting in the loss of both surface and groundwater that can jeopardize the sustainability of agriculture activities and the local ecosystem therefore a comprehensive understanding of the link between tanks and groundwater is important for an effective and sustainable use and management of water resources especially in the context of rain fed and drought prone regions globally groundwater is an important source of water for people in rural areas as about 85 of rural populations depend on groundwater for a variety of domestic and irrigation purposes world bank 2010 india is one of the largest users of groundwater resources in the world which extracts about 230 cubic kilometers per year cgwb 2014 varua et al 2018 prasad and rao 2018 more than 63 of agricultural land in india is irrigated using groundwater goi 2015 in arid and semi arid areas 60 100 of the water supply depends on groundwater hetzel et al 2008 overuse and over extraction of groundwater is associated with the significant risks of depletion and the long term irreversible degradation of water and contamination of groundwater prasad and rao 2018 sixty percent indian districts have already shown evidence of either groundwater depletion or contamination or a combination of both kulkarni et al 2015 since independence in 1947 and especially from the 1960s the importance of tank irrigation has shown a declining trend when the use of groundwater for irrigation started to grow rapidly as a result of the introduction of high yielding crop varieties hyv von oppen and subba rao 1980a sarkar and das 2014 varua et al 2018 in addition the share of tank irrigation in india declined because of the development of major and medium surface irrigation projects palanisami and easter 2000 many reasons for the decline of tank irrigated areas are reported by several studies in india that include encroachment and interception in the catchment areas poor maintenance silting feeder channels and development of well irrigation von oppen and subba rao 1980a palanisami and flinn 1988 reddy et al 1993 janakarajan 1991 1993 palanisami and easter 2000 balasubramanian and bromley 2002 observed that the increasing use of canal and well irrigation had significantly contributed to the degradation of tanks the introduction of electric and diesel pumps rural electrification and the introduction of high yielding crop varieties have contributed towards groundwater development sarkar and das 2014 rapid increase in the use of private wells by farmers in the command area of tanks also contributed significantly to this process amarnath and raja 2006 the constant decline of the cost of installing and operating private wells and pumps has incentivized farmers to install private wells pumps kajisa et al 2007 palanisami et al 2008 however the deterioration of the tank system hastens farmers to install private wells balasubramanian and selvaraj 2003 kajisa et al 2007 noted that the widespread diffusion of private wells is one of the important factors responsible for the decline in collective management of tank irrigation which led to lower yields among farmers who have no access to private wells historically the decline of tank irrigation is linked with population density von oppen and subba rao 1980b and lack of maintenance of tanks results in the reduction in the recharge capacity of the tank system which increases the tendency of farmers in the command area to shift to groundwater uses for irrigation besides variation in rainfall several factors such as siltation encroachment of tank beds and catchment areas and channel obstruction have reduced the tank irrigated area over the years janakarajan 1993 groundwater recharge is affected by many composite elements that are regulated by several factors for example cropping patterns cropping intensity climatic parameters hydraulic properties of the underlying soils and irrigation practices are some of the factors which directly influence groundwater recharge freeze and cherry 1979 srivastava et al 2017 finds that rainfall is positively associated with the recharge of groundwater levels similar results are found by jan et al 2007 which revealed that low rainfall intensity with a long duration could induce a greater groundwater recharge than large rainfall intensity with a short duration forest cover is another important parameter which influences the groundwater recharge tobella 2016 argued that tree size and tree spatial distribution significantly determines the extent of groundwater recharge the study finds that in the dry tropical region groundwater recharge is higher in the dense forest cover zone than in the regions with less or without any tree cover several studies exist that pointed out the effects of rapid urbanization on groundwater depletion changes in groundwater recharge cycle extensive groundwater contamination and fluctuation in groundwater levels foster et al 1993 vazquez sune et al 2005 the increased rate of urbanization reduces the infiltration to groundwater due to the concretization of paved areas roads and buildings in addition free and subsidized electricity policies and mismanagement of surface water bodies have resulted in the over exploitation of groundwater resources palanisami and ranganathan 2004 from the above discussion it is clear that there is less clarity on the link between the degradation of traditional water harvesting systems such as tanks and the depletion of groundwater levels it is important to note that the improvement of well productivity by recharging groundwater can be beneficial to the farmer associated with tanks shah and raju 2001 in tank dominated regions which are relatively dry and drought prone and people mostly dependent on wells for water loss of tank capacity is likely to cause the degradation of the tanks and at the same time may result in the loss of groundwater recharge reddy 1998 this study aims to identify factors responsible for the degradation of tank irrigation and the depletion of groundwater levels and establish the associated links between surface and groundwater limited studies exist that explore the relationship between traditional water harvesting structures and groundwater depletion using macro level data in india and west bengal the objective of the present paper is to identify and analyze the factors that determine the degradation of traditional water harvesting structures and the depletion of the groundwater levels in the indian state of west bengal 2 material and methods 2 1 study area west bengal is situated in the eastern part of the country between 21 20 n and 27 32 n latitude and 85 50 e and 89 52 e longitude the total area of the state is 88 752 sq km which is 2 7 of the total geographical area of the country the region is semi arid with a mean total annual rainfall of 1750 mm and average temperature ranges between 7 c to 26 c the overall cropping intensity of the state is 162 rice is the most important crop grown in the kharif or rainy season which at present accounts for 77 of the total rice crop area and 68 of the total area under food grain in the state of west bengal in addition wheat mustard jute groundnuts sugarcane potatoes fruit vegetables and flowers are cultivated about 7 5 of the water resources of the country are found in west bengal where rainfall is the main source of water 76 of the total annual rainfall is received in the monsoon months i e july august and september of the year about 21 of the rainfall infiltrates the soil and recharges the groundwater and 49 goes back to the atmosphere as evapo transpiration wbsapcc 2010 the rainfall generates only 51 billion cubic meters bcm of net annual water in west bengal wbpcb 2009 the replenishable groundwater is 34 bcm of which 69 is in south bengal and 31 is in north bengal from neighboring states the state receives 598 bcm of trans boundary water the river ganges is the main river and lifeline of south bengal which carries 525 bcm of water from its large upper catchment covering about 26 of the indian geographical area wbsapcc 2010 about 60 of the surface water and 28 of the groundwater in west bengal is available to north bengal which supports only 18 of the population of the region whereas 82 of the population residing in south bengal depends on only 40 of the surface water and extracts 78 of the total groundwater for its needs table 1 presents the distribution of water resources across different districts in the state in the form of per capita water availability average monsoon and non monsoon rainfall availability of surface and groundwater and the flow of trans boundary water into the state fig 1 presents the district wise per capita water availability and the districts that are experiencing annual water rainfall deficits it shows that bardhaman east medinipur howrah and hoogly districts considered the rice bowl of west bengal are experiencing an annual deficit of water available for agriculture from rainfall purulia bankura west medinipur and birbhum districts of the state suffer acute water shortages frequently during the summer the decline in traditional water harvesting systems has resulted in serious imbalances in water use and management in the state fig 2a presents the district concentration of tank irrigation in west bengal it shows that the districts of north and south 24 parganas howrah murshidabad maldah north and south dinajpur jalpaiguri coochbihar have low 25 000 ha tank irrigated areas compared to east and west medinipur hoogly and birbhum districts which have tank irrigated areas in the range of 25 000 50 000 ha purulia district reported to have the largest 50 000 ha tank irrigated area fig 2b shows the depth of groundwater across districts in west bengal howrah hoogly nadia and birbhum districts have more groundwater depth 6 m whereas north and south dinajpur maldah and jalpaiguri districts have a low groundwater depth 5 m similarly east and west medinipur bankura purulia north and south 24 parganas murshidabad and darjeeling districts have an average groundwater depth 5 6 m 2 2 econometric model specification and variables description in this paper two aspects of surface and groundwater linkages have formed the modeling strategy the determinants of performance degradation of tank irrigation and the decline of groundwater levels the first aspect is to identify the factors influencing the performance of irrigation tanks area irrigated by tanks which is determined by rainfall other sources of irrigation and others our main concern is to identify the determinants of tank performance hence a fixed effect model has been used to identify the controlling factors of tank irrigation performance in the form of the following equation 1 p e r f o r m a n c e o f tan k f a n n u a l m e a n r a inf a l l d e n s i t y o f t u b e w e l l p e r c e n t a g e o f r u r a l p o p u l a t i o n t o t h e t o t a l p o p u l a t i o n r i c e y i e l d p e r c a p i t a i n c o m e rainfall affects the performance of tank irrigation in two ways first it can have direct effects on the catchment runoff of the tank and second it indirectly affects the performance of other forms of irrigation like wells cannels and rivers balasubramanian and selvaraj 2003 it is hypothesized that the effect of rainfall on the performance of tanks is likely to be positive development of well irrigation is found to be one of the key factors that adversely influence the performance of tank irrigation balasubramanian and selvaraj 2003 the emergence of private well irrigation technology among farmers as a result of the constant prevailing condition of water stress in the region has in many ways led to the reduction in importance of tanks thus the rapid development of private wells in tank command areas has adverse effects on the performance of tanks palanisami and balasubramanian 1998 encroachment of tank beds their supply channels and catchment areas has reduced the efficiency of the tank irrigation system due to the lack of reliable macro level information on the extent of encroachment of tanks a proportion of the rural population is used as a proxy for the encroachment population pressure is likely to have a negative effect on the performance of tanks the profitability in cultivation may greatly influence farmer s choice of irrigation system that can ensure water during peak periods rice is a water intensive crop which is both intensively and extensively grown in west bengal and tank irrigation systems may not always ensure a water supply especially during the summer which adversely affects the farming community s interest in tank irrigation balasubramanian and selvaraj 2003 on the other hand higher agricultural income due to the adoption of technology may allow farmers to shift their interest from tank irrigation to groundwater irrigation ali et al 2014 hence it is hypothesized that rice cultivation over the years may influence the performance of tanks adversely and a higher per capita income may reduce the interest of farmers in the management practices of tanks a one year lag value of per capita income has been used in the model with the assumption that the willingness to maintain tanks is likely to be influenced by per capita income of the previous year forest cover in the command area of tanks help recharge groundwater through infiltration and release water to tanks gradually during the dry season hitinayake et al 2008 forest cover on the upper catchment area of tanks reduces the siltation rate of the tank and hence is likely to improve the performance of tanks however because of lack of availability of data the variable forest cover is not included in the model the second aspect of modeling strategies is the linkage between groundwater levels and the presence of tanks the study uses the dynamic panel data model based on the generalized methods of moments gmm developed by arellano and bond 1991 gmm obtained estimators by using the moment condition generated by the lower lagged level of groundwater because the depth of groundwater of the present year depends on the groundwater levels depth of the previous year the following equation is used to

rainfall the higher the groundwater recharge and the improvement of the groundwater levels the presence of tanks that store rainwater and help recharge groundwater is another key determinant factor of the improved groundwater levels monsoon rainfall is concentrated within a few weeks and tanks are able to store that rainwater throughout the year hence the presence of a large number of tanks is likely to help improve the groundwater levels in the region cropping intensity is likely to be influenced by the availability of irrigation facilities in india around 61 of the total irrigated area is irrigated by groundwater hence high cropping intensity regions are likely to witness a higher depletion of groundwater therefore within the high cropping intensity environment the depth of groundwater is likely to be high forest cover generally retains rainfall through its leafy surface and reduces runoff during heavy rains sutanudjaja et al 2011 within the forest areas surface water has more time to infiltrate the ground therefore larger forest cover increases the infiltration rate and thereby improves the groundwater levels the processes of urbanization enlarge the impervious surface area and increase the water demand the increase of impervious surface areas reduces the infiltration of water growing water demands lead to over extraction of groundwater and hence urbanization is linked with

software stata13 3 results and discussion 3 1 determinants of performance of tank irrigation the results of the econometric model estimation on the determinants of the performance of tank irrigation are presented in table 7 all the explanatory variables have turned out to be significant with theoretically consistent signs annual mean rainfall is positively and significantly at the 5 level related to the performance of tank irrigation implying that the performance of tank irrigation is positively influenced by rainfall this is true because the function of irrigation tanks is to conserve rainwater and release it for cultivation for the rest of the year hence the lack of adequate rainfall may adversely affect the performance of tank irrigation in the state as rainwater and tank irrigation is highly complementary the density of wells is negatively and significantly at the 1 level associated with the performance of tank irrigation this implies that as the concentration of wells increases the performance of tank irrigation is likely to decline which suggests that irrigation water from groundwater and tanks is competitive rather than complementary there could be several reasons for this phenomenon one of the reasons frequently cited in the literature is that when farmers shift from using tank water to groundwater they seem to reduce their participation in tank management activities as a result maintenance of tanks is badly affected and reduces the performance of tanks which further pushes the farmers to depend more on groundwater for irrigation balasubramanian 2006 the variable lagged rice yield has turned out to be negatively and significantly associated with the performance of tank irrigation implying that the effect of technical progress and farm mechanization in agriculture systems is adversely affecting the performance of tank irrigation the increased crop yield as a result of farm mechanization is likely to raise farmer s income the increased income may allow farmers to change their attitude towards groundwater which is more reliable than tank water as the increased per capita income of farmers may lead to investment in digging wells rural populations are negatively and significantly at the 5 level associated with the performance of tank irrigation which implies that as the rural population increases the performance of tank irrigation is likely to decline this may be because increased rural population in a closed rural economy may increase the pressure on the limited land and water resources which may result in rampant encroachment of tank beds and catchment areas adversely affecting the performance of tanks 3 2 determinants of the decline of groundwater levels table 8 presents the results of the dynamic panel model estimation on the determinants of the decline of groundwater levels the arellano bond test for autocorrelation has a null hypothesis of no autocorrelation and is applied to the differenced residuals the first order autocorrelations of the model is negative and statistically insignificant the second order autocorrelation is statistically insignificant which indicates that error is not correlated in first differences further the null hypotheses of the sargan z test statistic for test of over identifying restriction is valid p 0 810 is accepted in the model lagged groundwater level is positively and significantly at the 1 level is related to the depth of groundwater it may be because the levels of groundwater is dependent on its past realization annual mean rainfall is negatively and significantly associated with the depth of groundwater levels suggesting that as rainfall increases the depth at which groundwater is available is likely to be low the increased amount of rainfall leads to high infiltration of water into the ground and thereby improves the depth of groundwater levels however in recent years the climate change induced fluctuation of rainfall may accelerate the decrease in groundwater levels as decrease in rainfall during monsoons and non monsoon periods may cause acute water scarcity for crops and simultaneously trigger the extraction of groundwater for irrigating crops and hence result in the further decline of groundwater levels narjary et al 2014 the variable density of tank is negatively and significantly at the 1 level related to the depth of groundwater which implies that the higher the density of tanks the lower the depth of groundwater this result supports our findings in the descriptive analysis in the previous section tanks facilitate the process of the percolation of water into underlying aquifers by recharging the groundwater and hence reducing the depth of groundwater levels generally tanks are complex hydrological settings which influence multiple groundwater flows and are affected by geomorphologic settings and surrounded soil types tanks can store water throughout the year and help recharge groundwater the degradation of or reduction in the number of tanks in west bengal has resulted in heavy dependence on groundwater therefore one of the most important requirements for the stabilization of groundwater is to conserve both large and old tanks palanisami et al 2012 density of well is positively and significantly associated with the depth of groundwater levels implying that as the concentration of wells in a district increases the depth of groundwater is likely to be higher as pointed out above when farmers opt for well irrigation they tend to ignore the traditional water harvesting system such as tanks reducing the groundwater recharge the expansion of well irrigation is considered one of the reasons for declining groundwater levels takahiro and duraiyappan 2011 irrigation dependency on groundwater has increased with the onset of the green revolution which depended on the use of inputs such as water and fertilizers to boost farm production quinlan et al 2014 in addition increased irrigation subsidies on electricity and equipment have further worsened the situation studies show that a low power tariff has led to excessive water usage leading to declining water levels mukherji 2007 sarkar and das 2014 such a high density of wells may reduce the economic efficiency of groundwater extraction in the long run kumar et al 2011 fig 4 forest cover is inversely and significantly associated with the depth of groundwater levels which implies that a higher degree of forest cover may increase groundwater levels the negative and significant association between forest cover and improved groundwater levels might be because larger forest covers reduce the evapotranspiration from the soil and increase the rate of infiltration the forest cover hinders surface run off thus water has more time to percolate into the ground indirectly forest cover is associated with high rainfall that may help to improve groundwater levels the combined effects of high intensity rainfall and low infiltration prone soil dominates a higher occurrence of infiltration of overland flow in the tropics compared to the situation in humid temperate areas bonell 1993 krishnaswamy et al 2013 also found higher and consistent recharge under natural forests at smaller spatial scales in order to regulate the groundwater availability native forests play a significant role in addition forest cover facilitates the interception of moisture and conventional rainfall in the region conventionally it is believed that forests help maintain the seasonal water flow and removal of forest cover leads to a decline in groundwater levels galudra and sirait 2009 locatelli and vignola 2009 this view is based on the notion that forests act as giant sponges and soak up water during the wet season and release it in the dry season thus maintaining seasonal flows malmer et al 2010 the findings of the present study contribute significantly to the existing literature and ongoing discussion on the interaction between surface and groundwater in general and the importance of conserving traditional water harvesting systems such as tanks to improve groundwater levels recharge of aquifers in particular 4 conclusion the primary aim of the present study is to identify and analyze the determinants of the performance of tank irrigation and the decline of groundwater levels and examine the interaction between tank irrigation surface water and the depth of groundwater levels the results of the performance of tanks suggest that an increased amount of average rainfall positively influences the performance of tank irrigation while the increased density of wells mechanization of farms increased rural populations and per capita income adversely influence the same these results are strongly supported by empirical findings from other parts of india palanisami and flinn 1988 palanisami and easter 1991 janakarajan 1991 1993 palanisami and balasubramanian 1998 balasubramanian and selvaraj 2003 palanisami et al 2008 particularly the declining trend of tank irrigation is largely attributed to large scale use of groundwater for irrigation after the introduction of the green revolution without paying much attention to the maintenance of tanks similarly the results of the determinants of the decline of groundwater levels suggest that annual mean rainfall the density of tanks and forest cover positively influence the depth of groundwater levels while the density of wells adversely influence the same these findings clearly show that there exists a strong interaction between surface water tanks and groundwater depth which have important policy implications over emphasis on groundwater for irrigation in west bengal especially during the summer crops have resulted in decline in groundwater levels in the state mukherji et al 2012 this has compelled the state government to implement the groundwater act 2005 in the state in order to rationalize the extraction of groundwater government of west bengal 2005 however because of weak enforcement and lack of other supporting policy measures this policy measure is found to be ineffective in achieving its objectives ali et al 2016 varua et al 2018 on the other hand tank irrigation systems in the state have been left to decline without appropriate policy and institutional support from the state and the federal government for many decades interestingly the recent flagship programs of the government of india such as the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act 2005 mgnrega integrated watershed development programme wetland policy and others have explicitly or implicitly mentioned the importance of rejuvenation of tanks government of west bengal 2012 the findings of our study clearly indicate that in order to maintain a balance in the hydrological cycle tank irrigation and well irrigation should be used as complementary rather than as substitutes hence appropriate policy inceptions should be formulated for conservation of traditional water harvesting systems awareness among farmers about the strong linkages between surface and groundwater will go a long way in conserving these common resources in rural areas of india acknowledgement we sincerely thank the anonymous reviewers and the editor in chief of the journal for their valuable comments

12354,the present study aims to identify and analyze factors responsible for the discontinuity of irrigation tanks and the declining groundwater levels in the indian state of west bengal and attempts to establish the link between age old water harvesting structures such as tanks surface water and groundwater recharge using district level secondary data from 1992 to 2011 a fixed effect and dynamic panel regression models have been estimated in order to identify the determinants of the performance of irrigation tanks and the decline of groundwater levels respectively the results indicate that while the average annual rainfall positively influences the performance of irrigation tanks the mechanization of the farms the density of the wells increased rural population and per capita income adversely affect the performance of tanks the results of the determinants of the decline of groundwater levels show that while the average annual rainfall density of tanks and forest cover are likely to influence groundwater levels positively the density of wells is found to be adversely affecting the groundwater levels in the state the interaction between tank irrigation surface water and groundwater levels is found to be strong hence both tank irrigation and well irrigation should be used as complementary methods rather than substitutes in order to maintain a hydrological balance and use and manage water resources sustainably in the long run graphical abstract fx1 keywords traditional water harvesting structure groundwater tank degradation tank irrigation west bengal 1 introduction sustainable management and the use of water resources is critical for the overall development of human society in this context it is important to understand the dynamic and complex links between groundwater and surface water and their interactions this interaction takes place through physical linkage and the hydraulic connectivity of water among rivers wetlands tanks and surrounding catchments surface lateral flow and infiltration or exfiltration enhance the interaction between surface water and groundwater sophocleous 2002 von brömssen et al 2014 these groundwater and surface water interaction processes depend on the magnitude of the recharge and antecedent of soil moisture and aquifer conditions wood et al 1990 biswas et al 2017 in drought prone regions tanks are dug to harvest rainwater and are often used for percolation to recharge groundwater reddy and behera 2009 degradation of tanks and the encroachments of their catchment areas can disconnect the link between surface and groundwater resulting in the loss of both surface and groundwater that can jeopardize the sustainability of agriculture activities and the local ecosystem therefore a comprehensive understanding of the link between tanks and groundwater is important for an effective and sustainable use and management of water resources especially in the context of rain fed and drought prone regions globally groundwater is an important source of water for people in rural areas as about 85 of rural populations depend on groundwater for a variety of domestic and irrigation purposes world bank 2010 india is one of the largest users of groundwater resources in the world which extracts about 230 cubic kilometers per year cgwb 2014 varua et al 2018 prasad and rao 2018 more than 63 of agricultural land in india is irrigated using groundwater goi 2015 in arid and semi arid areas 60 100 of the water supply depends on groundwater hetzel et al 2008 overuse and over extraction of groundwater is associated with the significant risks of depletion and the long term irreversible degradation of water and contamination of groundwater prasad and rao 2018 sixty percent indian districts have already shown evidence of either groundwater depletion or contamination or a combination of both kulkarni et al 2015 since independence in 1947 and especially from the 1960s the importance of tank irrigation has shown a declining trend when the use of groundwater for irrigation started to grow rapidly as a result of the introduction of high yielding crop varieties hyv von oppen and subba rao 1980a sarkar and das 2014 varua et al 2018 in addition the share of tank irrigation in india declined because of the development of major and medium surface irrigation projects palanisami and easter 2000 many reasons for the decline of tank irrigated areas are reported by several studies in india that include encroachment and interception in the catchment areas poor maintenance silting feeder channels and development of well irrigation von oppen and subba rao 1980a palanisami and flinn 1988 reddy et al 1993 janakarajan 1991 1993 palanisami and easter 2000 balasubramanian and bromley 2002 observed that the increasing use of canal and well irrigation had significantly contributed to the degradation of tanks the introduction of electric and diesel pumps rural electrification and the introduction of high yielding crop varieties have contributed towards groundwater development sarkar and das 2014 rapid increase in the use of private wells by farmers in the command area of tanks also contributed significantly to this process amarnath and raja 2006 the constant decline of the cost of installing and operating private wells and pumps has incentivized farmers to install private wells pumps kajisa et al 2007 palanisami et al 2008 however the deterioration of the tank system hastens farmers to install private wells balasubramanian and selvaraj 2003 kajisa et al 2007 noted that the widespread diffusion of private wells is one of the important factors responsible for the decline in collective management of tank irrigation which led to lower yields among farmers who have no access to private wells historically the decline of tank irrigation is linked with population density von oppen and subba rao 1980b and lack of maintenance of tanks results in the reduction in the recharge capacity of the tank system which increases the tendency of farmers in the command area to shift to groundwater uses for irrigation besides variation in rainfall several factors such as siltation encroachment of tank beds and catchment areas and channel obstruction have reduced the tank irrigated area over the years janakarajan 1993 groundwater recharge is affected by many composite elements that are regulated by several factors for example cropping patterns cropping intensity climatic parameters hydraulic properties of the underlying soils and irrigation practices are some of the factors which directly influence groundwater recharge freeze and cherry 1979 srivastava et al 2017 finds that rainfall is positively associated with the recharge of groundwater levels similar results are found by jan et al 2007 which revealed that low rainfall intensity with a long duration could induce a greater groundwater recharge than large rainfall intensity with a short duration forest cover is another important parameter which influences the groundwater recharge tobella 2016 argued that tree size and tree spatial distribution significantly determines the extent of groundwater recharge the study finds that in the dry tropical region groundwater recharge is higher in the dense forest cover zone than in the regions with less or without any tree cover several studies exist that pointed out the effects of rapid urbanization on groundwater depletion changes in groundwater recharge cycle extensive groundwater contamination and fluctuation in groundwater levels foster et al 1993 vazquez sune et al 2005 the increased rate of urbanization reduces the infiltration to groundwater due to the concretization of paved areas roads and buildings in addition free and subsidized electricity policies and mismanagement of surface water bodies have resulted in the over exploitation of groundwater resources palanisami and ranganathan 2004 from the above discussion it is clear that there is less clarity on the link between the degradation of traditional water harvesting systems such as tanks and the depletion of groundwater levels it is important to note that the improvement of well productivity by recharging groundwater can be beneficial to the farmer associated with tanks shah and raju 2001 in tank dominated regions which are relatively dry and drought prone and people mostly dependent on wells for water loss of tank capacity is likely to cause the degradation of the tanks and at the same time may result in the loss of groundwater recharge reddy 1998 this study aims to identify factors responsible for the degradation of tank irrigation and the depletion of groundwater levels and establish the associated links between surface and groundwater limited studies exist that explore the relationship between traditional water harvesting structures and groundwater depletion using macro level data in india and west bengal the objective of the present paper is to identify and analyze the factors that determine the degradation of traditional water harvesting structures and the depletion of the groundwater levels in the indian state of west bengal 2 material and methods 2 1 study area west bengal is situated in the eastern part of the country between 21 20 n and 27 32 n latitude and 85 50 e and 89 52 e longitude the total area of the state is 88 752 sq km which is 2 7 of the total geographical area of the country the region is semi arid with a mean total annual rainfall of 1750 mm and average temperature ranges between 7 c to 26 c the overall cropping intensity of the state is 162 rice is the most important crop grown in the kharif or rainy season which at present accounts for 77 of the total rice crop area and 68 of the total area under food grain in the state of west bengal in addition wheat mustard jute groundnuts sugarcane potatoes fruit vegetables and flowers are cultivated about 7 5 of the water resources of the country are found in west bengal where rainfall is the main source of water 76 of the total annual rainfall is received in the monsoon months i e july august and september of the year about 21 of the rainfall infiltrates the soil and recharges the groundwater and 49 goes back to the atmosphere as evapo transpiration wbsapcc 2010 the rainfall generates only 51 billion cubic meters bcm of net annual water in west bengal wbpcb 2009 the replenishable groundwater is 34 bcm of which 69 is in south bengal and 31 is in north bengal from neighboring states the state receives 598 bcm of trans boundary water the river ganges is the main river and lifeline of south bengal which carries 525 bcm of water from its large upper catchment covering about 26 of the indian geographical area wbsapcc 2010 about 60 of the surface water and 28 of the groundwater in west bengal is available to north bengal which supports only 18 of the population of the region whereas 82 of the population residing in south bengal depends on only 40 of the surface water and extracts 78 of the total groundwater for its needs table 1 presents the distribution of water resources across different districts in the state in the form of per capita water availability average monsoon and non monsoon rainfall availability of surface and groundwater and the flow of trans boundary water into the state fig 1 presents the district wise per capita water availability and the districts that are experiencing annual water rainfall deficits it shows that bardhaman east medinipur howrah and hoogly districts considered the rice bowl of west bengal are experiencing an annual deficit of water available for agriculture from rainfall purulia bankura west medinipur and birbhum districts of the state suffer acute water shortages frequently during the summer the decline in traditional water harvesting systems has resulted in serious imbalances in water use and management in the state fig 2a presents the district concentration of tank irrigation in west bengal it shows that the districts of north and south 24 parganas howrah murshidabad maldah north and south dinajpur jalpaiguri coochbihar have low 25 000 ha tank irrigated areas compared to east and west medinipur hoogly and birbhum districts which have tank irrigated areas in the range of 25 000 50 000 ha purulia district reported to have the largest 50 000 ha tank irrigated area fig 2b shows the depth of groundwater across districts in west bengal howrah hoogly nadia and birbhum districts have more groundwater depth 6 m whereas north and south dinajpur maldah and jalpaiguri districts have a low groundwater depth 5 m similarly east and west medinipur bankura purulia north and south 24 parganas murshidabad and darjeeling districts have an average groundwater depth 5 6 m 2 2 econometric model specification and variables description in this paper two aspects of surface and groundwater linkages have formed the modeling strategy the determinants of performance degradation of tank irrigation and the decline of groundwater levels the first aspect is to identify the factors influencing the performance of irrigation tanks area irrigated by tanks which is determined by rainfall other sources of irrigation and others our main concern is to identify the determinants of tank performance hence a fixed effect model has been used to identify the controlling factors of tank irrigation performance in the form of the following equation 1 p e r f o r m a n c e o f tan k f a n n u a l m e a n r a inf a l

performance of tank irrigation in two ways first it can have direct effects on the catchment runoff of the tank and second it indirectly affects the performance of other forms of irrigation like wells cannels and rivers balasubramanian and selvaraj 2003 it is hypothesized that the effect of rainfall on the performance of tanks is likely to be positive development of well irrigation is found to be one of the key factors that adversely influence the performance of tank irrigation balasubramanian and selvaraj 2003 the emergence of private well irrigation technology among farmers as a result of the constant prevailing condition of water stress in the region has in many ways led to the reduction in importance of tanks thus the rapid development of private wells in tank command areas has adverse effects on the performance of tanks palanisami and balasubramanian 1998 encroachment of tank beds their supply channels and catchment areas has reduced the efficiency of the tank irrigation system due to the lack of reliable macro level information on the extent of encroachment of tanks a proportion of the rural population is used as a proxy for the encroachment population pressure is likely to have a negative effect on the performance of tanks the profitability in cultivation may greatly influence farmer s choice of irrigation system that can ensure water during peak periods rice is a water intensive crop which is both intensively and extensively grown in west bengal and tank irrigation systems may not always ensure a water supply especially during the summer which adversely affects the farming community s interest in tank irrigation balasubramanian and selvaraj 2003 on the other hand higher agricultural income due to the adoption of technology may allow farmers to shift their interest from tank irrigation to groundwater irrigation ali et al 2014 hence it is hypothesized that rice cultivation over the years may influence the performance of tanks adversely and a higher per capita income may reduce the interest of farmers in the management practices of tanks a one year lag value of per capita income has been used in the model with the assumption that the willingness to maintain tanks is likely to be influenced by per capita income of the previous year forest cover in the command area of tanks help recharge groundwater through infiltration and release water to tanks gradually during the dry season hitinayake et al 2008 forest cover on the upper catchment area of tanks reduces the siltation rate of the tank and hence is likely to improve the performance of

accelerate the decrease in groundwater levels as decrease in rainfall during monsoons and non monsoon periods may cause acute water scarcity for crops and simultaneously trigger the extraction of groundwater for irrigating crops and hence result in the further decline of groundwater levels narjary et al 2014 the variable density of tank is negatively and significantly at the 1 level related to the depth of groundwater which implies that the higher the density of tanks the lower the depth of groundwater this result supports our findings in the descriptive analysis in the previous section tanks facilitate the process of the percolation of water into underlying aquifers by recharging the groundwater and hence reducing the depth of groundwater levels generally tanks are complex hydrological settings which influence multiple groundwater flows and are affected by geomorphologic settings and surrounded soil types tanks can store water throughout the year and help recharge groundwater the degradation of or reduction in the number of tanks in west bengal has resulted in heavy dependence on groundwater therefore one of the most important requirements for the stabilization of groundwater is to conserve both large and old tanks palanisami et al 2012 density of well is positively and significantly associated with the depth of groundwater levels implying that as the concentration of wells in a district increases the depth of groundwater is likely to be higher as pointed out above when farmers opt for well irrigation they tend to ignore the traditional water harvesting system such as tanks reducing the groundwater recharge the expansion of well irrigation is considered one of the reasons for declining groundwater levels takahiro and duraiyappan 2011 irrigation dependency on groundwater has increased with the onset of the green revolution which depended on the use of inputs such as water and fertilizers to boost farm production quinlan et al 2014 in addition increased irrigation subsidies on electricity and equipment have further worsened the situation studies show that a low power tariff has led to excessive water usage leading to declining water levels mukherji 2007 sarkar and das 2014 such a high density of wells may reduce the economic efficiency of groundwater extraction in the long run kumar et al 2011 fig 4 forest cover is inversely and significantly associated with the depth of groundwater levels which implies that a higher degree of forest cover may increase groundwater levels the negative and significant association between forest cover and improved groundwater levels might be because larger forest covers reduce the evapotranspiration from the soil and increase the rate of infiltration the forest cover hinders surface run off thus water has more time to percolate into the ground indirectly forest cover is associated with high rainfall that may help to improve groundwater levels the combined effects of high intensity rainfall and low infiltration prone soil dominates a higher occurrence of infiltration of overland flow in the tropics compared to the situation in humid temperate areas bonell 1993 krishnaswamy et al 2013 also found higher and consistent recharge under natural forests at smaller spatial scales in order to regulate the groundwater availability native forests play a significant role in addition forest cover facilitates the interception of moisture and conventional rainfall in the region conventionally it is believed that forests help maintain the seasonal water flow and removal of forest cover leads to a decline in groundwater levels galudra and sirait 2009 locatelli and vignola 2009 this view is based on the notion that forests act as giant sponges and soak up water during the wet season and release it in the dry season thus maintaining seasonal flows malmer et al 2010 the findings of the present study contribute significantly to the existing literature and ongoing discussion on the interaction between surface and groundwater in general and the importance of conserving traditional water harvesting systems such as tanks to improve groundwater levels recharge of aquifers in particular 4 conclusion the primary aim of the present study is to identify and analyze the determinants of the performance of tank irrigation and the decline of groundwater levels and examine the interaction between tank irrigation surface water and the depth of groundwater levels the results of the performance of tanks suggest that an increased amount of average rainfall positively influences the performance of tank irrigation while the increased density of wells mechanization of farms increased rural populations and per capita income adversely influence the same these results are strongly supported by empirical findings from other parts of india palanisami and flinn 1988 palanisami and easter 1991 janakarajan 1991 1993 palanisami and balasubramanian 1998 balasubramanian and selvaraj 2003 palanisami et al 2008 particularly the declining trend of tank irrigation is largely attributed to large scale use of groundwater for irrigation after the introduction of the green revolution without paying much attention to the maintenance of tanks similarly the results of the determinants of the decline of groundwater levels suggest that annual mean rainfall the density of tanks and forest cover positively influence the depth of groundwater levels while the density of wells adversely influence the same these findings clearly show that there exists a strong interaction between surface water tanks and groundwater depth which have important policy implications over emphasis on groundwater for irrigation in west bengal especially during the summer crops have resulted in decline in groundwater levels in the state mukherji et al 2012 this has compelled the state government to implement the groundwater act 2005 in the state in order to rationalize the extraction of groundwater government of west bengal 2005 however because of weak enforcement and lack of other supporting policy measures this policy measure is found to be ineffective in achieving its objectives ali et al 2016 varua et al 2018 on the other hand tank irrigation systems in the state have been left to decline without appropriate policy and institutional support from the state and the federal government for many decades interestingly the recent flagship programs of the government of india such as the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act 2005 mgnrega integrated watershed development programme wetland policy and others have explicitly or implicitly mentioned the importance of rejuvenation of tanks government of west bengal 2012 the findings of our study clearly indicate that in order to maintain a balance in the hydrological cycle tank irrigation and well irrigation should be used as complementary rather than as substitutes hence appropriate policy inceptions should be formulated for conservation of traditional water harvesting systems awareness among farmers about the strong linkages between surface and groundwater will go a long way in conserving these common resources in rural areas of india acknowledgement we sincerely thank the anonymous reviewers and the editor in chief of the journal for their valuable comments
