20860,improved design methods for laterally loaded monopile foundation are crucial for the offshore wind turbine owt sector as established approaches no longer apply to such a pile foundation characterized by a relatively small length to diameter ratio numerical modeling is the primary approach to improve and validate design methods for monopiles and a central part of it is the soil constitutive model this work presents a model that captures the essential mechanical characteristics of cyclically loaded undrained clay yet retains simplicity demanded by practicing engineers this objective is realized by simplifying undrained clays as single phase materials governed by total stresses and utilizing kinematic hardening plasticity via a new kinematic hardening rule strength and stiffness anisotropy of clay and their cyclic deterioration are accommodated the model is evaluated at different scales of simulating laboratory soil tests and analyzing monopile subjected to monotonic and repeated lateral loading in geotechnical centrifuge tests the latter validation provides an encouraging demonstration of how monopile foundation can be numerically analyzed based on soil data acquired mainly from in situ site characterization and routine laboratory tests keywords offshore wind turbine monopile foundation lateral cyclic loading undrained clay constitutive models 1 introduction the motivation behind this work comes from the offshore wind turbines owt sector in which monopile a single large diameter steel pipe pile represents the predominant foundation type wind loads acting on the turbine and tower in addition to the action of wave and current apply considerable lateral loads and overturning moments to the monopile foundation standard p y methods as suggested for the design of laterally loaded piles in the oil and gas industry api 2010 dnvgl 2016 generally cannot provide a satisfactory basis for the design of monopile foundation due to its relatively small length to diameter ratio compared with those have been used to construct the p y approaches numerical methods such as finite element fe analyses can realistically consider the geometries of monopiles and hence appear as the most widely employed approaches to devise and validate new design methods for large diameter monopiles byrne et al 2020 zhang and andersen 2019 successful numerical analyses of the owt foundation rely on constitutive models that can realistically represent the soil response under specific loading and drainage conditions anticipated for particular applications many owt farms are constructed or planned in sea areas where foundation soils are largely composed of fine grained soils like clay byrne et al 2020 and their permeability relative to the typical rates of cyclic actions results in that the soils are usually under undrained conditions to represent the behavior of cyclically loaded undrained clay many effective stress based constitutive models have achieved considerable success e g liang and ma 1992 seidalinov and taiebat 2014 elia and rouainia 2016 and shi et al 2018b unfortunately their applications in routine design especially when the soil structure interactions under non monotonic loading histories are concerned are relatively limited this is possibly due to the complexity of these models and the difficulty to calibrate them based on data acquired from typical site characterization differently the methodology to idealize undrained clay as a single phase material governed by total stresses has shown remarkable potential for reasonably representing soil mechanical behavior yet significantly simplifying the numerical modeling of complex soil structure interaction processes houlsby 1999 anastasopoulos et al 2011 grimstad et al 2012 karapiperis and gerolymos 2014 kourkoulis et al 2014 huang and liu 2015 anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 yu et al 2017 page et al 2019 feng et al 2019 krabbenhøft et al 2019 whyte et al 2020 beyond simplicity the most important advantage of total stress models is that they operate directly on undrained shear strength that can be readily interpreted from typical in situ site characterizations when non monotonic histories of loading are concerned total stress models are augmented often through kinematic hardening plasticity framework armstrong and frederick 1966 mróz 1967 chaboche 2008 these kinematic hardening models when applied to undrained clays can successfully describe hysteretic behavior and material damping that grows with cyclic strain amplitudes but often cannot satisfactorily describe the anisotropic strength and stiffness of soils and the degradation of material properties as a consequence of cyclic loading these fundamental soil behaviors can be critical for accurately assessing the ultimate capacity of the monopile foundation and its serviceability during both short and long terms liu and hu 2009 andersen 2009 krabbenhøft et al 2019 byrne et al 2017 in this paper a total stress model is presented for cyclically loaded undrained clay hereafter will be referred to as the auc clay anisotropic undrained cyclic clay model in which the anisotropic stiffness and strength of soils their cyclic ratcheting i e accelerated development of strains due to stiffness degradation and strength deterioration due to load cycling are all accommodated by a new kinematic hardening law the auc clay model is first validated against the stress strain response of undrained clays measured in laboratory tests it is subsequently applied to the fe analyses of the monopile foundation subjected to both monotonic and cyclic lateral loads the accuracy of numerical modeling is assessed through the comparison between the computed and measured response of a series of centrifuge tests 2 constitutive model formulation the key components of a kinematic hardening model lemaitre and chaboche 1990 chaboche 2008 are presented in the following which has been employed often to represent the behavior of undrained soils e g karapiperis and gerolymos 2014 kourkoulis et al 2014 huang and liu 2015 and anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 this baseline model largely resembles that for metals subjected to cyclic loading available in abaqus and will be used here to clarify the motivations for the new propositions detailed in the following section and also as a platform to incorporate these modifications 2 1 baseline kinematic hardening model assuming the small deformation framework the total strain increment d ϵ i j obeys the following additive decomposition 1 d ϵ i j d ϵ i j e d ϵ i j p where the superscripts e and p stand for elastic and plastic respectively compression positive is assumed for both stress and strain measures hereafter to compute the plastic response a yield surface and a plastic flow rule are defined the yield surface is a mises surface see fig 1 and can be expressed by 2 f 3 2 s i j α i j d a r 0 in eq 2 s i j is the deviatoric stress tensor defined as s i j σ i j σ m m 3 δ i j where σ i j is the total stress tensor δ i j is the kronecker delta and σ m m σ 11 σ 22 σ 33 following einstein summation convention α i j is the internal variable that controls the translation of the yield surface i e kinematic hardening while the internal variables a and r denote the initial size of the yield surface and its isotropic hardening i e expansion or shrinkage as depicted in fig 1 the superscript d indicates the deviatoric part of a second order tensor e g α i j d α i j α m m 3 δ i j the brackets indicate the euclidean norm of a tensor in that a i j a i j a i j by assuming an associative flow rule the plastic strain increment is computed by 3 d ϵ i j p λ f σ i j λ 3 2 s i j α i j d s i j α i j d where the macaulay brackets indicate x x if x 0 and x 0 if x 0 while the plastic multiplier λ is evaluated from the consistency condition of the yield surface 4 λ 1 k p f σ i j d σ i j where k p denotes the plastic modulus the armstrong frederick af kinematic hardening rule armstrong and frederick 1966 is used to govern the translation of the yield surface 5 d α i j λ α i j λ c f σ i j γ α i j where c and γ are material constants one of the key characteristics of eq 5 is that it implies a saturation value of α i j by putting d α i j 0 6 α i j e q u c γ f σ i j the combination of eqs 2 and 6 further defines a strength surface that bounds all admissible stress states as shown in fig 1 a the strength surface f 0 is circular in the deviatoric plane centers at the origin of stress space and has a radius given by 2 3 a r c γ accordingly the modeled undrained clay exhibits isotropic strength which however is in contradiction with many experimental evidence e g zdravković 1996 and nishimura et al 2007 in addition to translation the yield surface size can change with irrecoverable strains i e the evolution of r this isotropic hardening detailed formulations can be found in chaboche 2008 is useful in modeling the ratcheting of metals but is found to considerably underestimate the cyclic deterioration of undrained clays huang and liu 2015 this is because the degree of degradation is constrained by the current size of the yield surface i e eq 1 requires a r 0 and for soils their yield stresses relative to strength can be much smaller than that for metals as appeared in the following this work uses a yield surface with fixed size anastasopoulos et al 2011 kourkoulis et al 2014 karapiperis and gerolymos 2014 page et al 2019 while modeling the cyclic degradation of soils solely through kinematic hardening the elastic response of undrained clay is described by a simple isotropic linearly elastic model that includes shear modulus g 0 and poisson s ratio ν as its parameters poisson s ratio greater than 0 49 is normally adopted to ensure that the bulk modulus k remains very large regardless of the value of shear modulus such that the elastic volume change is suppressed 2 2 anisotropic kinematic hardening rule to account for soil anisotropy the auc clay model replaces the kinematic hardening rule of eq 5 with the following proposition 7 d α i j λ α i j λ ρ e ρ s c f σ i j ρ e γ α i j β i j where the tensor β i j describes soil anisotropy while the factors ρ e and ρ s are introduced to account for the stiffness and strength degradation of cyclically loaded undrained clays respectively eq 7 and the original af rule are similar in that it also implies a limit state of α i j 8 α i j e q u β i j ρ s c γ f σ i j but significantly different in that the implied strength surface is around the tensor β i j see fig 1 b rather than the origin of the deviatoric plane consequently the predicted undrained strength depends on shear modes i e lode angle and the rotation of principal stresses with respect to the deposition direction the points labeled by tc and te in fig 1 b illustrate the distinct undrained strength for triaxial compression and extension modes of shear for fine grained soils encountered in most applications they primarily exhibit cross anisotropy with reference to a preferential direction of deposition stemming from one dimensional stress history in this special case the components of the tensor β i j can be fully defined by a scalar β in that β z z 2 3 β β x x β x x 1 3 β β x y β x z β y z 0 where z denotes the deposition direction x and y two mutually orthogonal directions within the plane of anisotropy and β 3 2 β i j β i j is the second invariant of β i j in fig 2 eqs 2 and 8 are jointly employed to compute the variation of undrained shear strength of cross anisotropic clay with the direction of principal stresses and the intermediate principal stress ratio for three different sectors in deviatoric plane the computed strength anisotroy is consistent with laboratory observations lade and kirkgard 2000 prashant and penumadu 2004 nishimura et al 2007 and that the strength isotropy is recovered by setting β i j 0 it should be emphasized that the kinematic hardening rule of eq 7 also implies stiffness anisotropy as the latter is inversely proportional to the closeness of the current stress to the strength surface the factor ρ e in eq 7 is responsible for modeling the cyclic ratcheting this fact can be clarified by deriving the expression of the plastic modulus in accordance with the consistency condition of the yield surface recall that the isotropic hardening of the yield surface is not considered and hence r d r 0 9 k p f α i j α i j ρ e 3 2 ρ s c γ f σ i j α i j β i j where the decrease of ρ e leads to the deterioration of the plastic modulus and also computed soil stiffness a strategy proven successful in modeling cyclic ratcheting is to relate the accumulation of irrecoverable deformations to the reduction of the plastic modulus prévost 1977 zienkiewicz and mróz 1984 liang and ma 1992 seidalinov and taiebat 2014 shi et al 2018a for this purpose the coefficient ρ e is assumed to obey 10 ρ e 1 1 c d ϵ d p where ϵ d p 2 3 d ϵ i j p d ϵ i j p λ quantifies the accumulation of deviatoric plastic strain and ρ e decreases monotonically with ϵ d p at the rate given by the material constant c d the coefficient ρ s in eq 7 is introduced to account for the strength deterioration of undrained clay subjected to repeated loading this becomes readily apparent by realizing that the size of the strength surface is given by 2 3 a ρ s c γ the factor ρ s is defined through the degradation relation proposed by einav and randolph 2005 as its parameters can be obtained by interpreting in situ tests like t bar test 11 s u s u 0 δ r e m 1 δ r e m exp 3 ϵ d p ϵ 95 where s u and s u 0 denote the softened and initial undrained shear strength δ r e m is the ratio of s u s u 0 that corresponds to a fully remolded state ϵ 95 is a material constant that indicates the required plastic shear strains to cause 95 reduction of soil strength our model predicts different strength s u depending on the modes of shear and principal stress directions in situ tests e g t bar from which the parameters in eq 11 are derived typically involve different modes of shear and degree of stress rotations accordingly to incorporate the relation of eq 11 into the model certain simplifications are required the degradation relation defined in eq 11 is assumed to apply to the size of the strength surface i e an overall measure of strength 12 s u s u 0 a ρ s c γ a c γ thus 13 ρ s s u s u 0 s u s u 0 1 a γ c lastly it should be noted that the propositions of eqs 10 and 11 imply that cumulative plastic strains are used to memorize past history of materials while this is widely accepted in the literature and provides a simple route in which cyclic softening of soils can be considered it should be noted that it is not always easy to determine the historic plastic deformations for soils in the field rubin 2001 accordingly it is suggested to treat the strain ϵ d p as a relative measure starting from the present state of soils in the field and any deterioration effect on strength and stiffness due to previous loading histories is implicitly embedded in the constants c and γ that are calibrated based on the response of soils sheared from its current states 3 simulation of monotonic and cyclic loading tests on undrained clay to validate the auc clay model it is used to simulate experimental tests performed on three types of clays including natural lightly overconsolidated oc chicago clay finno and kim 2011 reconstituted normally consolidated nc georgia kaolin sheu 1985 and reconstituted nc edgar kaolin hicher and lade 1987 the data set of chicago clay examines the model performance in representing the anisotropic stress strain strength response of clay subjected to monotonic triaxial shear the data set of georgia kaolin is employed to evaluate the model performance when cyclic loading in triaxial stress space is concerned while that for edgar kaolin is selected to assess the model behavior when the cyclic loading involves the rotation of principal stress directions and intermediate principal stress effects before presenting the simulations the approach to determine model parameters as summarized in table 1 is presented 3 1 calibration of auc clay model for cross anisotropic clay its triaxial compression and extension strength as defined by eqs 2 and 8 are s u tc ρ s c γ a β 2 and s u te ρ s c γ a β 2 respectively by considering that small deformations are often sufficient to mobilize full strength finno and chung 1992 huang et al 2011 and hence the degradation before reaching strength is often negligible i e ρ s 1 the ratio c γ can be related to the measured undrained shear strength by c γ s u tc s u te a subsequently the size of the yield surface a might be estimated from the linear portion of the measured stress strain curves or by assuming that a takes a relatively small portion of undrained strength e g a 0 05 to 0 1 s u tc with the ratio c γ known the individual values of c and γ can be determined by adjusting c to fit stress strain curves the parameter c d controls the rate of stiffness degradation and thus might be constrained by fitting the measured cyclic ratcheting the strength degradation parameters can be determined from in situ t bar or ball penetration tests by following the procedures described in einav and randolph 2005 lastly the modulus g 0 characterizes soil elastic stiffness at very small strains and can be determined from wave propagation techniques in the field or laboratory an important feature of total stress models is that the selected model properties have to reflect appropriately the in situ stress conditions e g in situ overburden stresses which are further related to the depths of soils the strength and shear wave velocity profiles as interpreted from in situ tests normally have included the influences of stresses if such information is not available undrained strength and elastic shear modulus can be related to in situ effective stresses through empirical correlations e g finno and chung 1992 ladd 1991 hardin and black 1969 and viggiani and atkinson 1995 or theoretical derivations based on critical state constitutive models schofield and wroth 1968 dafalias et al 2006 to initialize the model the initial values of the internal variables β i j should be determined as discussed previously in many application it is sufficient to assume clay is cross anisotropic and accordingly initialize β i j through β x x β y y β 3 β z z 2 β 3 β x y β y z β z x 0 the invariant β can be subsequently constrained by the relation β s u tc s u te 2 3 2 chicago clay the experimental tests employed here are conducted on soil specimens recovered from two deposition depths and thus are designated as deep block and shallow block respectively finno and kim 2011 in the experiments undrained triaxial compression ckcutc and extension ckcute tests are performed after samples have been anisotropically consolidated back to their in situ stress states i e vertical effective stress σ v of 143 and 204 kpa for shallow and deep blocks respectively and k 0 0 65 the model parameters and the initial values of internal variables for chicago clay are respectively given by tables 2 and 3 the shear modulus g 0 is determined from bender element tests while the parameters c γ and the internal variable β i j are determined from undrained shear tests following the procedures described previously a 10 kpa is adopted to match the nearly linear stress strain relation at the beginning of loading the parameters c d and δ r e m are assigned 0 and 1 respectively since cyclic loading is not concerned in this example fig 3 presents the measured and simulated response of the deep and shallow block clay in the ckcutc and ckcute tests it is seen that the strength anisotropy between triaxial compression and extension is well replicated by the model the non linearity in stress strain relation is reasonably represented by the model while the simulation tends to overestimate the stiffness at relatively large strains for triaxial extension this discrepancy might be attributed to the fact that the stress strain non linearity controlled by the parameters of c and γ is assumed to be independent of the lode angle and the mode of shear if desired this mismatch can be mitigated and or removed by inclusion of the direction dependence hardening behavior see grimstad et al 2012 however this refinement is currently not pursued to retain the simplicity of the model i e one of the primary objectives of this work model assessments in terms of material point response and modeling laterally loaded piles in the following suggest that this simplification is acceptable 3 3 georgia kaolin the reconstituted georgia kaolin samples are isotropically compressed to the normally consolidated state before applying symmetric triaxial load cycles sheu 1985 accordingly these tests are designated as ciu cyclic tx the procedures to determine model parameters for georgia kaolin see tables 2 and 3 are briefly summarized in the following the parameter a is determined according to the size of the approximately linear portion of the stress strain curve during the unloading phase of load cycles the values of c γ and β i j are constrained based on the results of undrained triaxial compression ciutc and extension ciute tests the parameter c d is calibrated by matching the measured ratcheting while δ r e m 1 is assumed as a fully destructured state is expected to result from the sample reconstitution the value of g 0 is related to the effective mean normal stress at the end of the consolidation via the correlation proposed by viggiani and atkinson 1995 fig 4 compares the measured response of georgia kaolin in two ciu cyclic tx tests subfigures a to b and those simulated by using the proposed model subfigures c to d it is seen that the model can reasonably represent the ratcheting response i e enlarged strains at peak shear stresses and generate the hysteresis loops that significantly expand and rotate with repeated loading it should be emphasized that like the test results e g fig 4 b the simulations exhibit non symmetric strain developments in that strains grow faster along the extension direction this biased strain growth can be attributed to the smaller strength and stiffness for the extension shear mode andersen 2009 that originate from cross anisotropy formed during slurry consolidation fig 4 e to f repeats the same simulations yet by ignoring mechanical anisotropy i e set β i j 0 this in general exhibits a symmetric ratcheting pattern the comparison stresses the role of anisotropy in affecting the response of cyclically loaded clay and show possible under estimation of soil deformations along critical loading direction while using an isotropic model i e compare fig 4 d and f lastly it is noted that the proposed model does not replicate the gain of stiffness see fig 4 b which occurs as the current stress passes beyond the phase transformation line and pore pressures decrease due to the tendency of the soils to dilate this discrepancy is attributed to the fact that the pore pressure response is not explicitly considered in total stress soil models when the aforementioned mechanical response is critical for certain application scenarios effective stress soil models should be pursued 3 4 edgar kaolin the cyclic torsion shear and cyclic true triaxial shear tests conducted on reconstituted edgar kaolin hicher and lade 1987 are used to examine the proposed model in replicating the response of undrained clay subjected to complex cyclic stress paths that involve the rotation of principal stresses and intermediate principal stress effects the two types of cyclic loading are executed in hollow cylinder apparatus and cubical triaxial apparatus respectively following an k 0 consolidation that brings soils to the normally consolidated state the procedures to calibrate the model are identical to those employed in the earlier examples except that the value of β is adjusted to fit the different undrained strength measured in monotonic torsion shear and true triaxial shear tests shown in fig 5 lastly δ r e m 1 is adopted for edgar kaolin as the difference between pre and post cyclic undrained strength is negligible hicher and lade 1987 the complete set of model parameters can be found in tables 2 and 3 fig 6 presents the results of two way cyclic torsion shear test subfigures a and b and its simulations subfigures c and d to be consistent with the test data reported by hicher and lade 1987 the computed vertical strains ϵ z and shear strains ϵ z θ are reported up to the 7th cycle and 10th cycle respectively it is seen that the continuous growth of the vertical strains ϵ z during both loading and unloading phases is correctly captured by the model the computed shear strains ϵ z θ however are smaller than that observed this discrepancy may be attributed to the adopted assumption that the hardening behavior is independent of lode angle and the rotation of principal stress directions consequently the softer response under torsional shear is not replicated despite this imperfection it is noted that the tested soil sample eventually fails due to excessive vertical strains hicher and lade 1987 as also indicated by the model simulation fig 7 compares the measured and computed development of major principal strains in cyclic torsional shear and cubic shear tests the cyclic shear amplitudes are characterized by the ratio ψ q c y c q c q m a x q c where q c y c is the peak deviatoric stress in cyclic loading tests q c is the deviatoric stress at the end of consolidation while q m a x is the undrained strength defined in monotonic tests the model reasonably replicates the following key soil behavior under given cyclic stress ratio the accumulation of deformations is more pronounced when cyclic loading is two way and or involves the rotation of principal stresses e g torsion shear quantitative mismatches between test data and model simulations can be observed and may be attributed to the reasons discussed above 4 analysis of monopile in normally consolidated clay the auc clay model is applied to the fe analyses of the monopile foundation subjected to both monotonic and repeated lateral actions the measurements used to validate such numerical modeling are obtained from geotechnical centrifuge tests conducted in normally consolidated nc saturated clay at 50g detailed descriptions of the testing facility and procedures can be found in lee 1991 yu et al 2018 li et al 2020 and li 2019 the model soil is malaysia kaolin clay and its basic properties are given in table 4 three centrifuge tests are modeled to examine whether fe analyses based on the proposed soil model can naturally consider the influences of pile geometries and head constraints on the response of laterally loaded piles among them two tests have the same pile head conditions i e fixed head but different pile geometries see table 5 while two have the same pile geometries but different head constraints i e fixed head versus free head the short pile has a relatively small length to diameter ratio l d 10 and falls within the typical range for a monopile foundation the semi rigid pile with l d 24 represents an intermediate case between monopiles and slender piles used in conventional offshore engineering l d ratio can be greater than 30 noted that in addition to fixed head constrain the combination between low l d ratio piles and free head conditions is also seen in engineering practice and it is useful to extend the numerical analyses described in the following to this case in future work 4 1 model geometries and finite element mesh the numerical analysis is performed by using fe code abaqus standard typical fe meshes with prototype geometries are given in fig 8 considering the symmetry of the problem only half of the domain is modeled and the displacements normal to the plane of symmetry are constrained the meshes extend laterally 14 d and vertically 8 d from the edge and end of the pile respectively these distances are shown to be sufficient for eliminating boundary effects li et al 2020 for nodes at the base boundary full fixity is enforced while lateral movements are prevented for nodes at the side boundary the horizontal load is applied in a displacement controlled manner it is conventional to characterize pile movement through the displacement at the mudline nevertheless due to the malfunction of the sensors for tracking the rotation of the pile above the mudline the applied horizontal displacement at pile head u is reported in fe analyses uniform displacement u is prescribed along the top surface of the pile for the free head condition see fig 8 b while the fixed head condition is modeled by constraining the part of the pile above the mudline as a rigid body see fig 8 a and consequently eliminating its rotation 4 2 material properties and interface modeling fig 9 a depicts the undrained shear strength interpreted from centrifuge t bar penetration tests together with the strength profile adopted in the fe model 14 s u t b a r s u 0 k u z the strength linearly increases with the depth z unit m i e a pattern typical of nc clay and the slope of the profile is denoted by k u the constant s u 0 denotes the strength at zero depth and a small value is assigned to ensure computational stability as previously discussed the strength interpreted from t bar tests normally reflects a mixture of different modes of shear thus might be linked to the size of the strength surface i e an overall measure of strength s u t b a r a c γ 2 it is further assumed that the parameter γ is constant throughout the stratum i e the stress strain non linearity is independent of stress levels while a 0 1 s u t b a r is adopted consequently the strength profile given in fig 9 a can be converted to the linear variation of the properties a and c with deposition depths leading to stress dependent yielding stress and plastic stiffness 15 a a 0 k a z c c 0 k c z moreover by adopting a constant s u te s u tc ratio through the soil stratum the anisotropy index β s u tc s u te 2 also increases with the depths 16 β β 0 k b z the constants β 0 and k b are determined from the strength profile of eq 14 along with the assumed ratio s u te s u tc 0 6 i e an average of the degree of anisotropy reported in previous studies finno and chung 1992 ladd 1991 the remolded strength ratio δ r e m is obtained from cyclic t bar penetration see fig 9 b following the procedures suggested by einav and randolph 2005 the parameter ϵ 95 is obtained from the same fitting process depicted in fig 9 b where ϵ t b a r indicates the plastic shear strains accumulated during one pass of t bar penetration or uplift and n is the number of full t bar penetration cycles the directly calibrated constant ϵ t b a r 95 from the cyclic t bar test is further converted to ϵ 95 following the procedure suggested by yu et al 2018 to consider the difference in the deformation mechanisms associated with pile soil interaction and t bar penetration the parameters γ and c d are assumed to independent of soil depths i e stress levels and are calibrated against the results of cyclic undrained triaxial tests ho 2013 on the same soil as shown in fig 10 these tests correspond to two different consolidation stresses prior to shear the influences of stress levels on material properties e g c a are considered by using their depth dependent relations i e eqs 14 to 16 and converting consolidation stresses to equivalent depths with effective unit weight of γ 6 4 kn m 3 and k 0 value of 0 46 purwana 2007 fig 10 shows that while the simulations are less than perfect the stress dependence of soil behavior can be reasonably represented the modulus g 0 is assumed to vary with the depths in a way similar to the strength profile 17 g 0 g 0 k g z where g 0 and k g are obtained by fitting the shear modulus measured from bender element tests ho 2013 table 6 summarizes the soil model parameters calibrated following the procedures described above in fe analyses the steel pile is modeled as an isotropic elastic medium young s modulus e 200 gpa and poisson s ratio ν 0 3 this modeling choice is valid before the yielding of pile steel which potentially can deteriorate the lateral capacity of piles post testing visual examination shows that model piles do not develop noticeable irrecoverable deformations after either monotonic or cyclic centrifuge tests fe simulations show that the computed pile bending stresses are within the yielding stress of the used steel both facts suggest that the aforementioned modeling choice is reasonable the interface between soils and monopile is modeled through a friction contact governed by coulomb s law enforced through the penalty method following tho et al 2013 a coulomb friction coefficient of 0 4 is adopted to model the interaction between stainless steel pile and clays it should be emphasized that the combination of friction contact and total stress models is a practical workaround to consider the variation of interface response with non uniform soil strength in abaqus standard a more appropriate and theoretically sound approach employs an adhesive interface with strength proportional to that of adjacent soils indeed the equivalence and or relation between adhesive interface and the currently employed friction one is a matter for future investigation 4 3 simulation steps and results in the fe model the initial stress field is generated through a geostatic step in accordance with a submerged unit weight γ 6 4 kn m 3 and a k 0 value of 0 46 effective unit weight is used to ensure in situ shear deviatoric stress can be correctly replicated in the fe model the monopile is subsequently subjected to a lateral displacement u at the pile top see fig 8 while the corresponding horizontal reaction force p is computed and will be referred to as pile load throughout the following discussions fig 11 presents the measured and computed prototype load displacement curves for the two model piles subjected to monotonic lateral displacements the comparison is given in the dimensionless form where s u avg indicates the t bar interpreted shear strength at the mid length of the pile embedment this normalization can partially eliminate the influences of pile length and consequently help to clarify the effects of l d ratios and head constraints on the lateral capacity of piles it should also be emphasized that the aforementioned normalization is more effective for the case when soil strength is fully mobilized throughout the entire pile embedment and is less effective when the rotation of pile is significant e g large l d ratios combined with free head conditions a reasonably good match between numerical simulations and centrifuge test results are observed while the computed pile head reactions tend to be higher both simulations and test data suggest a defined relationship between the embedment depth and foundation reaction stiffness the short pile i e l d 10 show considerably high normalized stiffness and consequently more evidence of reaching a defined capacity whereas the longer piles i e l d 24 keep picking up capacity with displacements as expected the pile head conditions significantly affect the ultimate lateral capacity see the piles with l d 24 but different head constraints fig 12 presents the measured response of monopiles subjected to cyclic lateral head movements characterized by both small and large amplitudes u max 0 05 d and 0 1 d u max is applied at the top of pile the simulations from the fe are overlain in the figure demonstrating an overall good agreement in particular considering that a single set of parameters is used in all computations similar to the monotonic tests described above the short pile shows larger normalized stiffness and hence develops hysteresis loops that have greater areas and are more uprightly posed given the same type of pile the hysteresis loops grow with the increase in cyclic amplitudes emphasizing the nonlinearity of the soil pile interaction it is observed that the simulated hysteresis loops tend to be leaner than those measured the piles in the tests show a very stiff response upon unloading leading to a rapid reduction of pile reaction force compared to the gradual decrease of reaction with pile displacement in the fe simulations future investigation is required to examine whether this mismatch can be mitigated and or eliminated by using more sophisticated elastic models e g those proposed by benz et al 2009 or shi and huang 2020 to characterize the stiffness of soils at small strains the measured reaction displacement curves e g see fig 12 f display the characteristics typically associated with the development of gaping between pile and soils i e the stiffness first becomes smaller and rises again the separation between soils and pile is also observed in the fe simulations nevertheless it might not be significant enough that the aforementioned features are not shown from the computed curves if desired the mismatch can be remedied by including a direction dependent hardening behavior described above which can better represent the differences between the soil deformations at the passive and active zones of the pile and hence simulating the gapping phenomenon the stiffness of monopile foundation response can deteriorate with load cycling due to the softening of soil elements near the pile which in turn significantly affect the long term performance of offshore wind turbine and the fatigue of its support structures fig 13 presents the evolution of pile foundation stiffness during cyclic loading the secant slope of the load displacement curves at the peak pile head movement see fig 12 f is used as an overall indicator of lateral pile stiffness the fe model reasonably reproduces the measured degradation of pile stiffness fig 13 suggests that although short and long piles show very different absolute stiffness of response the degradation relationship appears to relatively insensitive to the pile geometries and pile head conditions i e the degradation curves tend to be parallel moreover the degradation shows a nearly linear relationship in the semi log plot of the number of cycles versus the normalized stiffness which indicates that the rate of degradation is not constant yet decreases with the number of load cycles this trend is consistent with previous studies e g zhang et al 2011 and hamilton and murff 1995 and those seen in the cyclic t bar test see fig 9 b lastly it should be emphasized that despite existed discrepancies the example presented above gives an encouraging demonstration of the usefulness of the auc clay model in particular its capacity to analyze monopile foundation behavior by relying on model parameters mostly derived from in situ site characterizations and routine laboratory tests 5 conclusions a simple total stress based constitutive model is presented for undrained clay subjected to cyclic loading with the overarching goal of balancing the accuracy and complexity in the design of foundation for the offshore wind turbine sector an anisotropic kinematic hardening rule is proposed through which strength and stiffness anisotropy of clay and their cyclic deterioration can all be accommodated the model referred to as auc clay model is used to simulate a series of laboratory soil element tests and applied to the finite element fe analyses of centrifuge model tests that examine the response of monopile foundation subjected to both monotonic and repeated lateral actions the following main conclusions can be drawn from this work the auc clay model can reasonably represent the behavior of undrained clay under monotonic and non monotonic histories of stresses and subjected to loading paths with and without rotations of principal stresses the numerical modeling of centrifuge tests demonstrates the capacity of the proposed model to analyze laterally loaded monopile foundation by relying on soil parameters derived directly from in situ site characterizations and routine laboratory tests lastly it should be noted that while the proposed model shows promising features further steps might be undertaken to enhance its capacities for instance the small strain stiffness of soils can be incorporated to better represent the hysteresis in the load displacement response of monopile foundation cyclic degradation rates that vary with stress strain levels may be considered to refine the model simulations of cyclic softening of soils and associated

20860,improved design methods for laterally loaded monopile foundation are crucial for the offshore wind turbine owt sector as established approaches no longer apply to such a pile foundation characterized by a relatively small length to diameter ratio numerical modeling is the primary approach to improve and validate design methods for monopiles and a central part of it is the soil constitutive model this work presents a model that captures the essential mechanical characteristics of cyclically loaded undrained clay yet retains simplicity demanded by practicing engineers this objective is realized by simplifying undrained clays as single phase materials governed by total stresses and utilizing kinematic hardening plasticity via a new kinematic hardening rule strength and stiffness anisotropy of clay and their cyclic deterioration are accommodated the model is evaluated at different scales of simulating laboratory soil tests and analyzing monopile subjected to monotonic and repeated lateral loading in geotechnical centrifuge tests the latter validation provides an encouraging demonstration of how monopile foundation can be numerically analyzed based on soil data acquired mainly from in situ site characterization and routine laboratory tests keywords offshore wind turbine monopile foundation lateral cyclic loading undrained clay constitutive models 1 introduction the motivation behind this work comes from the offshore wind turbines owt sector in which monopile a single large diameter steel pipe pile represents the predominant foundation type wind loads acting on the turbine and tower in addition to the action of wave and current apply considerable lateral loads and overturning moments to the monopile foundation standard p y methods as suggested for the design of laterally loaded piles in the oil and gas industry api 2010 dnvgl 2016 generally cannot provide a satisfactory basis for the design of monopile foundation due to its relatively small length to diameter ratio compared with those have been used to construct the p y approaches numerical methods such as finite element fe analyses can realistically consider the geometries of monopiles and hence appear as the most widely employed approaches to devise and validate new design methods for large diameter monopiles byrne et al 2020 zhang and andersen 2019 successful numerical analyses of the owt foundation rely on constitutive models that can realistically represent the soil response under specific loading and drainage conditions anticipated for particular applications many owt farms are constructed or planned in sea areas where foundation soils are largely composed of fine grained soils like clay byrne et al 2020 and their permeability relative to the typical rates of cyclic actions results in that the soils are usually under undrained conditions to represent the behavior of cyclically loaded undrained clay many effective stress based constitutive models have achieved considerable success e g liang and ma 1992 seidalinov and taiebat 2014 elia and rouainia 2016 and shi et al 2018b unfortunately their applications in routine design especially when the soil structure interactions under non monotonic loading histories are concerned are relatively limited this is possibly due to the complexity of these models and the difficulty to calibrate them based on data acquired from typical site characterization differently the methodology to idealize undrained clay as a single phase material governed by total stresses has shown remarkable potential for reasonably representing soil mechanical behavior yet significantly simplifying the numerical modeling of complex soil structure interaction processes houlsby 1999 anastasopoulos et al 2011 grimstad et al 2012 karapiperis and gerolymos 2014 kourkoulis et al 2014 huang and liu 2015 anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 yu et al 2017 page et al 2019 feng et al 2019 krabbenhøft et al 2019 whyte et al 2020 beyond simplicity the most important advantage of total stress models is that they operate directly on undrained shear strength that can be readily interpreted from typical in situ site characterizations when non monotonic histories of loading are concerned total stress models are augmented often through kinematic hardening plasticity framework armstrong and frederick 1966 mróz 1967 chaboche 2008 these kinematic hardening models when applied to undrained clays can successfully describe hysteretic behavior and material damping that grows with cyclic strain amplitudes but often cannot satisfactorily describe the anisotropic strength and stiffness of soils and the degradation of material properties as a consequence of cyclic loading these fundamental soil behaviors can be critical for accurately assessing the ultimate capacity of the monopile foundation and its serviceability during both short and long terms liu and hu 2009 andersen 2009 krabbenhøft et al 2019 byrne et al 2017 in this paper a total stress model is presented for cyclically loaded undrained clay hereafter will be referred to as the auc clay anisotropic undrained cyclic clay model in which the anisotropic stiffness and strength of soils their cyclic ratcheting i e accelerated development of strains due to stiffness degradation and strength deterioration due to load cycling are all accommodated by a new kinematic hardening law the auc clay model is first validated against the stress strain response of undrained clays measured in laboratory tests it is subsequently applied to the fe analyses of the monopile foundation subjected to both monotonic and cyclic lateral loads the accuracy of numerical modeling is assessed through the comparison between the computed and measured response of a series of centrifuge tests 2 constitutive model formulation the key components of a kinematic hardening model lemaitre and chaboche 1990 chaboche 2008 are presented in the following which has been employed often to represent the behavior of undrained soils e g karapiperis and gerolymos 2014 kourkoulis et al 2014 huang and liu 2015 and anastasopoulos and theofilou 2016 this baseline model largely resembles that for metals subjected to cyclic loading available in abaqus and will be used here to clarify the motivations for the new propositions detailed in the following section and also as a platform to incorporate these modifications 2 1 baseline kinematic hardening model assuming the small deformation framework the total strain increment d ϵ i j obeys the following additive decomposition 1 d ϵ i j d ϵ i j e d ϵ i j p where the superscripts e and p stand for elastic and plastic respectively compression positive is assumed for both stress and strain measures hereafter to compute the plastic response a yield surface and a plastic flow rule are defined the yield surface is a mises surface see fig 1 and can be expressed by 2 f 3 2 s i j α i j d a r 0 in eq 2 s i j is the deviatoric stress tensor defined as s i j σ i j σ m m 3 δ i j where σ i j is the total stress tensor δ i j is the kronecker delta and σ m m σ 11 σ 22 σ 33 following einstein summation convention α i j is the internal variable that controls the translation of the yield surface i e kinematic hardening while the internal variables a and r denote the initial size of the yield surface and its isotropic hardening i e expansion or shrinkage as depicted in fig 1 the superscript d indicates the deviatoric part of a second order tensor e g α i j d α i j α m m 3 δ i j the brackets indicate the euclidean norm of a tensor in that a i j a i j a i j by assuming an associative flow rule the plastic strain increment is computed by 3 d ϵ i j p λ f σ i j λ 3 2 s i j α i j d s i j α i j d where the macaulay brackets indicate x x if x 0 and x 0 if x 0 while the plastic multiplier λ is evaluated from the consistency condition of the yield surface 4 λ 1 k p f σ i j d σ i j where k p denotes the plastic modulus the armstrong frederick af kinematic hardening rule armstrong and frederick 1966 is used to govern the translation of the yield surface 5 d α i j λ α i j λ c f σ i j γ α i j where c and γ are material constants one of the key characteristics of eq 5 is that it implies a saturation value of α i j by putting d α i j 0 6 α i j e q u c γ f σ i j the combination of eqs 2 and 6 further defines a strength surface that bounds all admissible stress states as shown in fig 1 a the strength surface f 0 is circular in the deviatoric plane centers at the origin of stress space and has a radius given by 2 3 a r c γ accordingly the modeled undrained clay exhibits isotropic strength which however is in contradiction with many experimental evidence e g zdravković 1996 and nishimura et al 2007 in addition to translation the yield surface size can change with irrecoverable strains i e the evolution of r this isotropic hardening detailed formulations can be found in chaboche 2008 is useful in modeling the ratcheting of metals but is found to considerably underestimate the cyclic deterioration of undrained clays huang and liu 2015 this is because the degree of degradation is constrained by the current size of the yield surface i e eq 1 requires a r 0 and for soils their yield stresses relative to strength can be much smaller than that for metals as appeared in the following this work uses a yield surface with fixed size anastasopoulos et al 2011 kourkoulis et al 2014 karapiperis and gerolymos 2014 page et al 2019 while modeling the cyclic degradation of soils solely through kinematic hardening the elastic response of undrained clay is described by a simple isotropic linearly elastic model that includes shear modulus g 0 and poisson s ratio ν as its parameters poisson s ratio greater than 0 49 is normally adopted to ensure that the bulk modulus k remains very large regardless of the value of shear modulus such that the elastic volume change is suppressed 2 2 anisotropic kinematic hardening rule to account for soil anisotropy the auc clay model replaces the kinematic hardening rule of eq 5 with the following proposition 7 d α i j λ α i j λ ρ e ρ s c f σ i j ρ e γ α i j β i j where the tensor β i j describes soil anisotropy while the factors ρ e and ρ s are introduced to account for the stiffness and strength degradation of cyclically loaded undrained clays respectively eq 7 and the original af rule are similar in that it also implies a limit state of α i j 8 α i j e q u β i j ρ s c γ f σ i j but significantly different in that the implied strength surface is around the tensor β i j see fig 1 b rather than the origin of the deviatoric plane consequently the predicted undrained strength depends on shear modes i e lode angle and the rotation of principal stresses with respect to the deposition direction the points labeled by tc and te in fig 1 b illustrate the distinct undrained strength for triaxial compression and extension modes of shear for fine grained soils encountered in most applications they primarily exhibit cross anisotropy with reference to a preferential direction of deposition stemming from one dimensional stress history in this special case the components of the tensor β i j can be fully defined by a scalar β in that β z z 2 3 β β x x β x x 1 3 β β x y β x z β y z 0 where z denotes the deposition direction x and y two mutually orthogonal directions within the plane of anisotropy and β 3 2 β i j β i j is the second invariant of β i j in fig 2 eqs 2 and 8 are jointly employed to compute the variation of undrained shear strength of cross anisotropic clay with the direction of principal stresses and the intermediate principal stress ratio for three different sectors in deviatoric plane the computed strength anisotroy is consistent with laboratory observations lade and kirkgard 2000 prashant and penumadu 2004 nishimura et al 2007 and that the strength isotropy is recovered by setting β i j 0 it should be emphasized that the kinematic hardening rule of eq 7 also implies stiffness anisotropy as the latter is inversely proportional to the closeness of the current stress to the strength surface the factor ρ e in eq 7 is responsible for modeling the cyclic ratcheting this fact can be clarified by deriving the expression of the plastic modulus in accordance with the consistency condition of the yield surface recall that the isotropic hardening of the yield surface is not considered and hence r d r 0 9 k p f α i j α i j ρ e 3 2 ρ s c γ f σ i j α i j β i j where the decrease of ρ e leads to the deterioration of the plastic modulus and also computed soil stiffness a strategy proven successful in modeling cyclic ratcheting is to relate the accumulation of irrecoverable deformations to the reduction of the plastic modulus prévost 1977 zienkiewicz and mróz 1984 liang and ma 1992 seidalinov and taiebat 2014 shi et al 2018a for this purpose the coefficient ρ e is assumed to obey 10 ρ e 1 1 c d ϵ d p where ϵ d p 2 3 d ϵ i j p d ϵ i j p λ quantifies the accumulation of deviatoric plastic strain and ρ e decreases monotonically with ϵ d p at the rate given by the material constant c d the coefficient ρ s in eq 7 is introduced to account for the strength deterioration of undrained clay subjected to repeated loading this becomes readily apparent by realizing that the size of the strength surface is given by 2 3 a ρ s c γ the factor ρ s is defined through the degradation relation proposed by einav and randolph 2005 as its parameters can be obtained by interpreting in situ tests like t bar test 11 s u s u 0 δ r e m 1 δ r e m exp 3 ϵ d p ϵ 95 where s u and s u 0 denote the softened and initial undrained shear strength δ r e m is the ratio of s u s u 0 that corresponds to a fully remolded state ϵ 95 is a material constant that indicates the required plastic shear strains to cause 95 reduction of soil strength our model predicts different strength s u depending on the modes of shear and principal stress directions in situ tests e g t bar from which the parameters in eq 11 are derived typically involve different modes of shear and degree of stress rotations accordingly to incorporate the relation of eq 11 into the model certain simplifications are required the degradation relation defined in eq 11 is assumed to apply to the size of the strength surface i e an overall measure of strength 12 s u s u 0 a ρ s c γ a c γ thus 13 ρ s s u s u 0 s u s u 0 1 a γ c lastly it should be noted that the propositions of eqs 10 and 11 imply that cumulative plastic strains are used to memorize past history of materials while this is widely accepted in the literature and provides a simple route in which cyclic softening of soils can be considered it should be noted that it is not always easy to determine the historic plastic deformations for soils in the field rubin 2001 accordingly it is suggested to treat the strain ϵ d p as a relative measure starting from the present state of soils in the field and any deterioration effect on strength and stiffness due to previous loading histories is implicitly embedded in the constants c and γ that are calibrated based on the response of soils sheared from its current states 3 simulation of monotonic and cyclic loading tests on undrained clay to validate the auc clay model it is used to simulate experimental tests performed on three types of clays including natural lightly overconsolidated oc chicago clay finno and kim 2011 reconstituted normally consolidated nc georgia kaolin sheu 1985 and reconstituted nc edgar kaolin hicher and lade 1987 the data set of chicago clay examines the model performance in representing the anisotropic stress strain strength response of clay subjected to monotonic triaxial shear the data set of georgia kaolin is employed to evaluate the model performance when cyclic loading in triaxial stress space is concerned while that for edgar kaolin is selected to assess the model behavior when the cyclic loading involves the rotation of principal stress directions and intermediate principal stress effects before presenting the simulations the approach to determine model parameters as summarized in table 1 is presented 3 1 calibration of auc clay model for cross anisotropic clay its triaxial compression and extension strength as defined by eqs 2 and 8 are s u tc ρ s c γ a β 2 and s u te ρ s c γ a β 2 respectively by considering that small deformations are often sufficient to mobilize full strength finno and chung 1992 huang et al 2011 and hence the degradation before reaching strength is often negligible i e ρ s 1 the ratio c γ can be related to the measured undrained shear strength by c γ s u tc s u te a subsequently the size of the yield surface a might be estimated from the linear portion of the measured stress strain curves or by assuming that a takes a relatively small portion of undrained strength e g a 0 05 to 0 1 s u tc with the ratio c γ known the individual values of c and γ can be determined by adjusting c to fit stress strain curves the parameter c d controls the rate of stiffness degradation and thus might be constrained by fitting the measured cyclic ratcheting the strength degradation parameters can be determined from in situ t bar or ball penetration tests by following the procedures described in einav and randolph 2005 lastly the modulus g 0 characterizes soil elastic stiffness at very small strains and can be determined from wave propagation techniques in the field or laboratory an important feature of total stress models is that the selected model properties have to reflect appropriately the in situ stress conditions e g in situ overburden stresses which are further related to the depths of soils the strength and shear wave velocity profiles as interpreted from in situ tests normally have included the influences of stresses if such information is not available undrained strength and elastic shear modulus can be related to in situ effective stresses through empirical correlations e g finno and chung 1992 ladd 1991 hardin and black 1969 and viggiani and atkinson 1995 or theoretical derivations based on critical state constitutive models schofield and wroth 1968 dafalias et al 2006 to initialize the model the initial values of the internal variables β i j should be determined as discussed previously in many application it is sufficient to assume clay is cross anisotropic and accordingly initialize β i j through β x x β y y β 3 β z z 2 β 3 β x y β y z β z x 0 the invariant β can be subsequently constrained by the relation β s u tc s u te 2 3 2 chicago clay the experimental tests employed here are conducted on soil specimens recovered from two deposition depths and thus are designated as deep block and shallow block respectively finno and kim 2011 in the experiments undrained triaxial compression ckcutc and extension ckcute tests are performed after samples have been anisotropically consolidated back to their in situ stress states i e vertical effective stress σ v of 143 and 204 kpa for shallow and deep blocks respectively and k 0 0 65 the model parameters and the initial values of internal variables for chicago clay are respectively given by tables 2 and 3 the shear modulus g 0 is determined from bender element tests while the parameters c γ and the internal variable β i j are determined from undrained shear tests following the procedures described previously a 10 kpa is adopted to match the nearly linear stress strain relation at the beginning of loading the parameters c d and δ r e m are assigned 0 and 1 respectively since cyclic loading is not concerned in this example fig 3 presents the measured and simulated response of the deep and shallow block clay in the ckcutc and ckcute tests it is seen that the strength anisotropy between triaxial compression and extension is well replicated by the model the non linearity in stress strain relation is reasonably represented by the model while the simulation tends to overestimate the stiffness at relatively large strains for triaxial extension this discrepancy might be attributed to the fact that the stress strain non linearity controlled by the parameters of c and γ is assumed to be independent of the lode angle and the mode of shear if desired this mismatch can be mitigated and or removed by inclusion of the direction dependence hardening behavior see grimstad et al 2012 however this refinement is currently not pursued to retain the simplicity of the model i e one of the primary objectives of this work model assessments in terms of material point response and modeling laterally loaded piles in the following suggest that this simplification is acceptable 3 3 georgia kaolin the reconstituted georgia kaolin samples are isotropically compressed to the normally consolidated state before applying symmetric triaxial load cycles sheu 1985 accordingly these tests are designated as ciu cyclic tx the procedures to determine model parameters for georgia kaolin see tables 2 and 3 are briefly summarized in the following the parameter a is determined according to the size of the approximately linear portion of the stress strain curve during the unloading phase of load cycles the values of c γ and β i j are constrained based on the results of undrained triaxial compression ciutc and extension ciute tests the parameter c d is calibrated by matching the measured ratcheting while δ r e m 1 is assumed as a fully destructured state is expected to result from the sample reconstitution the value of g 0 is related to the effective mean normal stress at the end of the consolidation via the correlation proposed by viggiani and atkinson 1995 fig 4 compares the measured response of georgia kaolin in two ciu cyclic tx tests subfigures a to b and those simulated by using the proposed model subfigures c to d it is seen that the model can reasonably represent the ratcheting response i e enlarged strains at peak shear stresses and generate the hysteresis loops that significantly expand and rotate with repeated loading it should be emphasized that like the test results e g fig 4 b the simulations exhibit non symmetric strain developments in that strains grow faster along the extension direction this biased strain growth can be attributed to the smaller strength and stiffness for the extension shear mode andersen 2009 that originate from cross anisotropy formed during slurry consolidation fig 4 e to f repeats the same simulations yet by ignoring mechanical anisotropy i e set β i j 0 this in general exhibits a symmetric ratcheting pattern the comparison stresses the role of anisotropy in affecting the response of cyclically loaded clay and show possible under estimation of soil deformations along critical loading direction while using an isotropic model i e compare fig 4 d and f lastly it is noted that the proposed model does not replicate the gain of stiffness see fig 4 b which occurs as the current stress passes beyond the phase transformation line and pore pressures decrease due to the tendency of the soils to dilate this discrepancy is attributed to the fact that the pore pressure response is not explicitly considered in total stress soil models when the aforementioned mechanical response is critical for certain application scenarios effective stress soil models should be pursued 3 4 edgar kaolin the cyclic torsion shear and cyclic true triaxial shear tests conducted on reconstituted edgar kaolin hicher and lade 1987 are used to examine the proposed model in replicating the response of undrained clay subjected to complex cyclic stress paths that involve the rotation of principal stresses and intermediate principal stress effects the two types of cyclic loading are executed in hollow cylinder apparatus and cubical triaxial apparatus respectively following an k 0 consolidation that brings soils to the normally consolidated state the procedures to calibrate the model are identical to those employed in the earlier examples except that the value of β is adjusted to fit the different undrained strength measured in monotonic torsion shear and true triaxial shear tests shown in fig 5 lastly δ r e m 1 is adopted for edgar kaolin as the difference between pre and post cyclic undrained strength is negligible hicher and lade 1987 the complete set of model parameters can be found in tables 2 and 3 fig 6 presents the results of two way cyclic torsion shear test subfigures a and b and its simulations subfigures c and d to be consistent with the test data reported by hicher and lade 1987 the computed vertical strains ϵ z and shear strains ϵ z θ are reported up to the 7th cycle and 10th cycle respectively it is seen that the continuous growth of the vertical strains ϵ z during both loading and unloading phases is correctly captured by the model the computed shear strains ϵ z θ however are smaller than that observed this discrepancy may be attributed to the adopted assumption that the hardening behavior is independent of lode angle and the rotation of principal stress directions consequently the softer response under torsional shear is not replicated despite this imperfection it is noted that the tested soil sample eventually fails due to excessive vertical strains hicher and lade 1987 as also indicated by the model simulation fig 7 compares the measured and computed development of major principal strains in cyclic torsional shear and cubic shear tests the cyclic shear amplitudes are characterized by the ratio ψ q c y c q c q m a x q c where q c y c is the peak deviatoric stress in cyclic loading tests q c is the deviatoric stress at the end of consolidation while q m a x is the undrained strength defined in monotonic tests the model reasonably replicates the following key soil behavior under given cyclic stress ratio the accumulation of deformations is more pronounced when cyclic loading is two way and or involves the rotation of principal stresses e g torsion shear quantitative mismatches between test data and model simulations can be observed and may be attributed to the reasons discussed above 4 analysis of monopile in normally consolidated clay the auc clay model is applied to the fe analyses of the monopile foundation subjected to both monotonic and repeated lateral actions the measurements used to validate such numerical modeling are obtained from geotechnical centrifuge tests conducted in normally consolidated nc saturated clay at 50g detailed descriptions of the testing facility and procedures can be found in lee 1991 yu et al 2018 li et al 2020 and li 2019 the model soil is malaysia kaolin clay and its basic properties are given in table 4 three centrifuge tests are modeled to examine whether fe analyses based on the proposed soil model can naturally consider the influences of pile geometries and head constraints on the response of laterally loaded piles among them two tests have the same pile head conditions i e fixed head but different pile geometries see table 5 while two have the same pile geometries but different head constraints i e fixed head versus free head the short pile has a relatively small length to diameter ratio l d 10 and falls within the typical range for a monopile foundation the semi rigid pile with l d 24 represents an intermediate case between monopiles and slender piles used in conventional offshore engineering l d ratio can be greater than 30 noted that in addition to fixed head constrain the combination between low l d ratio piles and free head conditions is also seen in engineering practice and it is useful to extend the numerical analyses described in the following to this case in future work 4 1 model geometries and finite element mesh the numerical analysis is performed by using fe code abaqus standard typical fe meshes with prototype geometries are given in fig 8 considering the symmetry of the problem only half of the domain is modeled and the displacements normal to the plane of symmetry are constrained the meshes extend laterally 14 d and vertically 8 d from the edge and end of the pile respectively these distances are shown to be sufficient for eliminating boundary effects li et al 2020 for nodes at the base boundary full fixity is enforced while lateral movements are prevented for nodes at the side boundary the horizontal load is applied in a displacement controlled manner it is conventional to characterize pile movement through the displacement at the mudline nevertheless due to the malfunction of the sensors for tracking the rotation of the pile above the mudline the applied horizontal displacement at pile head u is reported in fe analyses uniform displacement u is prescribed along the top surface of the pile for the free head condition see fig 8 b while the fixed head condition is modeled by constraining the part of the pile above the mudline as a rigid body see fig 8 a and consequently eliminating its rotation 4 2 material properties and interface modeling fig 9 a depicts the undrained shear strength interpreted from centrifuge t bar penetration tests together with the strength profile adopted in the fe model 14 s u t b a r s u 0 k u z the strength linearly increases with the depth z unit m i e a pattern typical of nc clay and the slope of the profile is denoted by k u the constant s u 0 denotes the strength at zero depth and a small value is assigned to ensure computational stability as previously discussed the strength interpreted from t bar tests normally reflects a mixture of different modes of shear thus might be linked to the size of the strength surface i e an overall measure of strength s u t b a r a c γ 2 it is further assumed that the parameter γ is constant throughout the stratum i e the stress strain non linearity is independent of stress levels while a 0 1 s u t b a r is adopted consequently the strength profile given in fig 9 a can be converted to the linear variation of the properties a and c with deposition depths leading to stress dependent yielding stress and plastic stiffness 15 a a 0 k a z c c 0 k c z moreover by adopting a constant s u te s u tc ratio through the soil stratum the anisotropy index β s u tc s u te 2 also increases with the depths 16 β β 0 k b z the constants β 0 and k b are determined from the strength profile of eq 14 along with the assumed ratio s u te s u tc 0 6 i e an average of the degree of anisotropy reported in previous studies finno and chung 1992 ladd 1991 the remolded strength ratio δ r e m is obtained from cyclic t bar penetration see fig 9 b following the procedures suggested by einav and randolph 2005 the parameter ϵ 95 is obtained from the same fitting process depicted in fig 9 b where ϵ t b a r indicates the plastic shear strains accumulated during one pass of t bar penetration or uplift and n is the number of full t bar penetration cycles the directly calibrated constant ϵ t b a r 95 from the cyclic t bar test is further converted to ϵ 95 following the procedure suggested by yu et al 2018 to consider the difference in the deformation mechanisms associated with pile soil interaction and t bar penetration the parameters γ and c d are assumed to independent of soil depths i e stress levels and are calibrated against the results of cyclic undrained triaxial tests ho 2013 on the same soil as shown in fig 10 these tests correspond to two different consolidation stresses prior to shear the influences of stress levels on material properties e g c a are considered by using their depth dependent relations i e eqs 14 to 16 and converting consolidation stresses to equivalent depths with effective unit weight of γ 6 4 kn m 3 and k 0 value of 0 46 purwana 2007 fig 10 shows that while the simulations are less than perfect the stress dependence of soil behavior can be reasonably represented the modulus g 0 is assumed to vary with the depths in a way similar to the strength profile 17 g 0 g 0 k g z where g 0 and k g are obtained by fitting the shear modulus measured from bender element tests ho 2013 table 6 summarizes the soil model parameters calibrated following the procedures described above in fe analyses the steel pile is modeled as an isotropic elastic medium young s modulus e 200 gpa and poisson s ratio ν 0 3 this modeling choice is valid before the yielding of pile steel which potentially can deteriorate the lateral capacity of piles post testing visual examination shows that model piles do not develop noticeable irrecoverable deformations after either monotonic or cyclic centrifuge tests fe simulations show that the computed pile bending stresses are within the yielding stress of the used steel both facts suggest that the aforementioned modeling choice is reasonable the interface between soils and monopile is modeled through a friction contact governed by coulomb s law enforced through the penalty method following tho et al 2013 a coulomb friction coefficient of 0 4 is adopted to model the interaction between stainless steel pile and clays it should be emphasized that the combination of friction contact and total stress models is a practical workaround to consider the variation of interface response with non uniform soil strength in abaqus standard a more appropriate and theoretically sound approach employs an adhesive interface with strength proportional to that of adjacent soils indeed the equivalence and or relation between adhesive interface and the currently employed friction one is a matter for future investigation 4 3 simulation steps and results in the fe model the initial stress field is generated through a geostatic step in accordance with a submerged unit weight γ 6 4 kn m 3 and a k 0 value of 0 46 effective unit weight is used to ensure in situ shear deviatoric stress can be correctly replicated in the fe model the monopile is subsequently subjected to a lateral displacement u at the pile top see fig 8 while the corresponding horizontal reaction force p is computed and will be referred to as pile load throughout the following discussions fig 11 presents the measured and computed prototype load displacement curves for the two model piles subjected to monotonic lateral displacements the comparison is given in the dimensionless form where s u avg indicates the t bar interpreted shear strength at the mid length of the pile embedment this normalization can partially eliminate the influences of pile length and consequently help to clarify the effects of l d ratios and head constraints on the lateral capacity of piles it should also be emphasized that the aforementioned normalization is more effective for the case when soil strength is fully mobilized throughout the entire pile embedment and is less effective when the rotation of pile is significant e g large l d ratios combined with free head conditions a reasonably good match between numerical simulations and centrifuge test results are observed while the computed pile head reactions tend to be higher both simulations and test data suggest a defined relationship between the embedment depth and foundation reaction stiffness the short pile i e l d 10 show considerably high normalized stiffness and consequently more evidence of reaching a defined capacity whereas the longer piles i e l d 24 keep picking up capacity with displacements as expected the pile head conditions significantly affect the ultimate lateral capacity see the piles with l d 24 but different head constraints fig 12 presents the measured response of monopiles subjected to cyclic lateral head movements characterized by both small and large amplitudes u max 0 05 d and 0 1 d u max is applied at the top of pile the simulations from the fe are overlain in the figure demonstrating an overall good agreement in particular considering that a single set of parameters is used in all computations similar to the monotonic tests described above the short pile shows larger normalized stiffness and hence develops hysteresis loops that have greater areas and are more uprightly posed given the same type of pile the hysteresis loops grow with the increase in cyclic amplitudes emphasizing the nonlinearity of the soil pile interaction it is observed that the simulated hysteresis loops tend to be leaner than those measured the piles in the tests show a very stiff response upon unloading leading to a rapid reduction of pile reaction force compared to the gradual decrease of reaction with pile displacement in the fe simulations future investigation is required to examine whether this mismatch can be mitigated and or eliminated by using more sophisticated elastic models e g those proposed by benz et al 2009 or shi and huang 2020 to characterize the stiffness of soils at small strains the measured reaction displacement curves e g see fig 12 f display the characteristics typically associated with the development of gaping between pile and soils i e the stiffness first becomes smaller and rises again the separation between soils and pile is also observed in the fe simulations nevertheless it might not be significant enough that the aforementioned features are not shown from the computed curves if desired the mismatch can be remedied by including a direction dependent hardening behavior described above which can better represent the differences between the soil deformations at the passive and active zones of the pile and hence simulating the gapping phenomenon the stiffness of monopile foundation response can deteriorate with load cycling due to the softening of soil elements near the pile which in turn significantly affect the long term performance of offshore wind turbine and the fatigue of its support structures fig 13 presents the evolution of pile foundation stiffness during cyclic loading the secant slope of the load displacement curves at the peak pile head movement see fig 12 f is used as an overall indicator of lateral pile stiffness the fe model reasonably reproduces the measured degradation of pile stiffness fig 13 suggests that although short and long piles show very different absolute stiffness of response the degradation relationship appears to relatively insensitive to the pile geometries and pile head conditions i e the degradation curves tend to be parallel moreover the degradation shows a nearly linear relationship in the semi log plot of the number of cycles versus the normalized stiffness which indicates that the rate of degradation is not constant yet decreases with the number of load cycles this trend is consistent with previous studies e g zhang et al 2011 and hamilton and murff 1995 and those seen in the cyclic t bar test see fig 9 b lastly it should be emphasized that despite existed discrepancies the example presented above gives an encouraging demonstration of the usefulness of the auc clay model in particular its capacity to analyze monopile foundation behavior by relying on model parameters mostly derived from in situ site characterizations and routine laboratory tests 5 conclusions a simple total stress based constitutive model is presented for undrained clay subjected to cyclic loading with the overarching goal of balancing the accuracy and complexity in the design of foundation for the offshore wind turbine sector an anisotropic kinematic hardening rule is proposed through which strength and stiffness anisotropy of clay and their cyclic deterioration can all be accommodated the model referred to as auc clay model is used to simulate a series of laboratory soil element tests and applied to the finite element fe analyses of centrifuge model tests that examine the response of monopile foundation subjected to both monotonic and repeated lateral actions the following main conclusions can be drawn from this work the auc clay model can reasonably represent the behavior of undrained clay under monotonic and non monotonic histories of stresses and subjected to loading paths with and without rotations of principal stresses the numerical modeling of centrifuge tests demonstrates the capacity of the proposed model to analyze laterally loaded monopile foundation by relying on soil parameters derived directly from in situ site characterizations and routine laboratory tests lastly it should be noted that while the proposed model shows promising features further steps might be undertaken to enhance its capacities for instance the small strain stiffness of soils can be incorporated to better represent the hysteresis in the load displacement response of monopile foundation cyclic degradation rates that vary with stress strain levels may be considered to refine the model simulations of cyclic softening of soils and associated

20861,this paper presents a study of precisely three dimensional 3 d trajectory tracking controller design for auv vehicles regarding to highly uncertain nonlinear model features internal external disturbances and roll motion s effect firstly the six degrees of freedom 6 dof nonlinear equations of motion are described subsequently a novel control scheme is proposed based on cascade structure which divides the control problem into dual coupled problems called kinematic control and dynamic control furthermore four nonlinear disturbance observers ndos are innovatively constructed to handle

robustness of the proposed control scheme keywords under actuated auv 3 d trajectory tracking control model uncertainties back stepping sliding mode control nonlinear disturbances observers ndo control lyapunov function clf 1 introduction nowadays people increasingly pay attention to exploiting and searching for resources in the ocean because of the depletion of resources on the land therefore various marine equipment have been strongly developed in recent decades therein auv shows that it is not only one of the most popular applied underwater devices but also a significant role in scientific commercial and military applications these applications include offshore oil field exploration oceanographic mapping inspection of underwater structures anti submarine warfare oceanographic surveying and so on wynn et al 2014 gafurov and klochkov 2015 zhang et al 2015 mondal et al 2019 to accomplish the aforementioned tasks efficiently and accurately auvs often need to be maneuvered in three dimensional space especially for complex tasks it requires the satisfaction of both spatial and temporal constraints consequently the study of trajectory tracking control algorithms in three dimensional space has become a research hotspot in the control field however it is always a great challenge to design a reliable tracking controller due to highly coupled nonlinearities in the auv dynamic and the uncertainties in the ocean environments in the past two decades trajectory tracking control of underwater vehicles has been studied extensively but mostly solves problems in the planar such as repoulias and papadopoulos 2007 elmokadem et al 2016 2017 yan et al 2015 shen et al 2018 xia et al 2019 for horizontal plane and li and lee 2005 cao et al 2011 joe et al 2014 xia et al 2020 tran et al 2021 for vertical plane although these studies have successful results and promising for implementation in practice most of them cannot be extended to spatial trajectory tracking control yu et al 2019 at the same time plenty of research effort has been dedicated to the 3 d trajectory tracking problem and achieve some certain successes specifically qiao et al 2017 qiao and zhang 2019 liu et al 2020 gan et al 2018 used sliding mode control smc to build controller because it provides fast response and robustness to ensure bounded tracking error against un modeled dynamics and exogenous disturbances qiao et al 2017 proposed specific approaches including min max saturation and smooth transition one to control auv to precisely track a preset trajectory regarding to dynamic uncertainties and time varied perturbations in qiao and zhang 2019 an adaptive second order fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode control asofntsmc scheme was developed as to accurately tracking control a fully actuated auv in the presence of time varying noises in liu et al 2020 a quaternion based adaptive non singular terminal sliding mode control scheme was studied for trajectory tracking control problem of a typical fully actuated auv to ocean current and modeling uncertainty however the chattering phenomenon in sliding mode control hasn t been resolved in the above three papers gan et al 2018 designed a model predictive control mpc method based on quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso combining with sliding mode control for the dynamic trajectory tracking problem of unmanned underwater vehicle uuv in this paper qpso mpc was utilized to design a kinematic controller and limit the velocity of vehicle within a specified range to handle the speed jump problem while smc was adopted in dynamic control besides smc the backstepping techniques and lyapunov s direct method are also especially prevalent for the development of trajectory tracking controllers aguiar and hespanha 2007 rezazadegan et al 2015 li et al 2015 karkoub et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 von ellenrieder 2019 aguiar and hespanha 2007 presented adaptive switching supervisory control combined with a nonlinear lyapunov based tracking control law to solve the trajectory tracking and path following problem for under actuated autonomous vehicles in the presence of possibly large modeling parametric uncertainty in rezazadegan et al 2015 an adaptive controller based on lyapunov s direct method and the back stepping technique was developed to guarantee robustness against parameter uncertainties for the trajectory tracking control of the 5 dof auv model one drawback however is that the computational process of control laws in this paper proves too complex li et al 2015 introduced the control algorithm that uses the vehicle s kinematic equation and linear system stability theory to obtain the velocity error dynamics then back stepping techniques were adopted to force the tracking error to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero nevertheless the simulation results show that the proposed control law has not helped q and r converge to the desired value thereby leads to the position error not converging to zero a hierarchical robust nonlinear hrn controller which utilizes the back stepping and sliding mode control technique with hierarchical structure based on the kinematic and dynamic models of the system was discovered by karkoub et al 2017 to solve the trajectory tracking problem of auv with multiple uncertainties e g current disturbances un modeled dynamics and parameter variations although the simulation results demonstrate the controller s effectiveness and feasibility the application of this algorithm is limited to specific vehicles because most auvs only stabilize the roll angle instead of control zhou et al 2018 developed a three dimensional tracking controller for under actuated auvs with velocity regulation and back stepping technique this controller utilizes the bio inspired models for surge velocity error and angular velocity errors to overcome the frequently occurring problem of parameter skip at an inflection point and the singularity problem existing in the back stepping tracking control method as well as increase system robustness the simulation results show that the controller not only overcomes the skipping problem at inflection points but also avoids the singularity problem nevertheless the overall error value between the desired and actual trajectories has a steady state quite large in von ellenrieder 2019 an approach similar to back stepping allowing one to avoid the explosion of complexity by using first order filters to compute the derivatives of the system namely dynamic surface control dsc was adopted to design an n degree of freedom nonlinear control law for the trajectory tracking of marine vehicles in this paper the author used a disturbance observer to handle the unknown time varying disturbances as well as addressed saturated input moreover there exist other methods which are applied to solve the 3 d trajectory tracking problem for auv for example there are adaptive control aguiar and hespanha 2007 yan et al 2019 qiao and zhang 2019a 2019b kumar and rani 2020 model predictive control gan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 yan et al 2020 neural network shojaei and arefi2015 wang et al 2019 kumar and rani 2020 as an overall judgment it could be said that most of the previously mentioned research works considered the 3 d trajectory tracking problem for fully actuated auvs and only a few of the papers are about the 3 d trajectory tracking for under actuated auvs aguiar and hespanha 2007 rezazadegan et al 2015 li et al 2015 shojaei and arefi 2015 zhou et al 2018 yan et al 2019 wang et al 2019 although the above studies have conferred new tools and promising solutions for the 3 d trajectory tracking problem they often raise the complexity of the controller structure and make them restricted to apply in practice yi et al 2016 on the other hand the algorithms that the authors consider for fully actuated auvs are hardly to apply widely since conventional auvs have a slender torpedo shape for speed and efficiency and are an under actuated system besides there is an alternate point of view to consider in the 3 d trajectory tracking problem studies mentioned above is the authors have usually neglected the roll motion for simplicity and return the problem to 5 dof for controller design stability analysis and simulation unfortunately that the torpedo shaped auvs have a small moment of inertia and drag in the roll motion so the roll dynamic easily suffers oscillatory when auvs are affected by propeller torque unknown disturbances yaw and pitch motion therefore if the controller building process doesn t consider the roll motion it can lead to the deterioration of the control quality or even cause instability for the whole system prompted by these observations this paper focuses on developing a novel control scheme with less computational complexity using lyapunov s direct method and the cascade approach for the 3 d trajectory tracking control of under actuated auvs in the presence of model uncertainties and roll motion s effect the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the cascade approach is employed to divide the trajectory tracking problem into two sub problems namely kinematic and dynamic control in order to simplify and reduce the complexity of the proposed algorithm while preserving the stability of the whole system in the presence of roll motion and model uncertainties in the kinematic control the 6 dof kinematic equation of auv and lyapunov s direct method are utilized to compute the desired values for surge velocity pitch angle and heading angle to force the trajectory tracking error to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero in this way many different algorithms can be applied for the dynamic control to design attitude and velocity controllers to track the desired values calculated from the kinematic control therefore the proposed algorithm can facilely apply advanced or optimal algorithms to increase the performance of the whole system or solve many extensive problems such as ocean current input constraint sensor failure 2 four nonlinear disturbance observers ndo are built to compensate for the errors in the linearization process and the uncertainties in the 6 dof dynamic model of auv when designing attitude and velocity controllers 3 the lyapunov concept is adopted to demonstrate the uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of all closed loop signals besides the robustness feasibility and efficiency of the novel control scheme are examined and verified via plenty of numerical simulations the rest of this study is structured as follows section 2 introduces the auv 6 dof structure in which focuses on the trajectory tracking error features and formulates the control problem section 3 presents the novel 3 d trajectory tracking control scheme design of proposed nonlinear disturbance observer ndo and the detailed building and proving process of the kinematic and dynamic controller in section 4 the proposed control scheme is verified via various numerical simulations with analysis eventually section 5 delineates conclusions

3 problem formulation the control objective is to maneuver the under actuated auv for precisely tracking the predefined three dimensional trajectory with respect to the coupled model nonlinearities model uncertainties and roll motion effect moreover as to be efficient in implementing the controller the objective is divided into the following two control sub problems 1 kinematic control given a desired three dimensional trajectory the trajectory tracking errors dynamics 11 and assume that the roll angle is stabilized by the roll controller design the guidance law to provide the desired surge velocity u d desired pitch angle θ d desired heading angle ψ d so that the trajectory tracking errors in 7 converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero in case t 2 dynamic control given the desired surge velocity u d desired pitch angle θ d desired heading angle ψ d and the dynamic model 2 build the control laws x p r o p x g y g and δ r to guarantee the tracking errors u u d θ θ d ψ ψ d and φ converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero in case t with respect to the highly coupled system nonlinearities and model uncertainties to solve the problem of the controller design presented below it is necessary to assume that assumption 1 the desired three dimensional trajectory is finitely determined as to ensure x d y d z d x d y d and z d strictly bounded assumption 2 the model uncertainties and the linearization errors are bounded so there exists positive constants d u d p d q and d r such that the following conditions are satisfied d u d u d p d p d q d q and d r d r assumption 3 the linear and angular velocities of auv are bounded during operation 3 proposed control scheme implementation 3 1 framing of the novel controller as mentioned above the paper focuses on developing a novel control scheme based on the cascade structure where the 3 d trajectory tracking problem is divided into two subsystems namely kinematic control and dynamic control as shown in fig 3 in kinematic control to guarantee the trajectory tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero as t goes to infinity the lyapunov s direct method is adopted to generate the desired values for surge velocity pitch angle and heading angle compare with the previous study because the proposed method has a simpler trajectory tracking error dynamics model the calculation procedure and the desired values for dynamic control are less complicated therefore the proposed method improves the applicability in practice while ensuring the efficiency and accuracy of the convergence to the desired trajectory in dynamic control the main task is to build controllers to stabilize the roll angle and track the desired values calculated from kinematic control including attitude controller and velocity controller to achieve favorable tracking control against the linearization errors and model uncertainties the nonlinear disturbance observer ndo is utilized compare with the previous study because the proposed method allows any algorithm to design the attitude controllers and the velocity controller advanced and optimal algorithms can be easily applied to enhance the tracking performance converging rate and robustness on the other hand it is also accessible to upgrade to deal with other complex problems such as ocean current input constraint sensor failure to point out this superiority this paper uses two algorithms pid and back stepping sliding mode control bsm to build the controller then compare analyze and evaluate the obtained results 3 2 proposed ndo

kinematic control following guidance law is proposed 16 u d u d h k 1 x e y e 2 δ h 2 δ h 2 v 2 cos 2 θ α w 2 θ d λ α ψ d γ d ϕ χ where λ arcsin k 2 z e z d u v χ atan y e δ h δ h 0 is the look ahead distance k 1 k 2 0 are the control gains theorem 1 assume that the desired trajectory satisfies assumption 1 the roll angle is bounded during movement and converge to a neighborhood of zero by the roll stabilization controller then the guidance law 16 guarantees that the trajectory tracking errors 7 is bounded and convergent to a specified compact set around the origin if u θ ψ converge to the neighborhood of desired values proof defining 17 ψ ψ ψ d θ θ θ d u u u d by using trigonometric formulas one can obtain 18 cos ψ γ d ϕ δ h y e 2 δ h 2 ψ cos ψ 1 ψ cos χ sin ψ ψ sin χ sin ψ γ d ϕ y e y

and λ min m denote the maximum eigenvalue of n and the smallest eigenvalue of m respectively moreover h i i 1 2 3 will converge to zero if u θ ψ converge to the desired values thus it can be concluded from 26 that the trajectory tracking errors 7 is bounded and convergent to a compact value around the origin remark 2 because of the assumption that the roll angle is stabilized and converges to a

vector e d converges to a specified compact set around the origin with the control laws 31 34 37 40 alternatively we can reduce the amplitude of this bounded set and improve the converging rate by increasing ρ φ ρ θ ρ ψ ρ u from tuning the control gains k i i 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and observer gains l j j φ θ ψ u 4 resulted case studies in this section plenty of case studies and discussions will be implemented to evaluate the eﬀiciency feasibility and robustness of the novel control scheme to point out the superiority of the proposed method the following four controllers are compared 1 the proposed scheme with bsm applied for dynamic control marked as the bsm based dynamic controller 2 the proposed scheme with pid applied for dynamic control marked as the pid based dynamic controller it means that the dynamic control part included roll pid controller pitch pid controller heading pd controller and surge pid controller 3 the sliding mode controller is based on the algorithm proposed in yan et al 2019 which has the block diagram shown in fig 4 marked as yan s controller 4 the back stepping controller is based on the algorithm proposed in zhou et al 2018 which has the block diagram shown in fig 5 marked as zhou s controller to ensure objectivity and completeness of the comparison the vehicle is expected to track different desired trajectories included sinusoidal trajectory and spiral trajectory in all case studies to demonstrate the disturbance estimation capability anti jamming ability of proposed controllers under model uncertainties the parameters of f i g i i p q r u in formula 4 are varied by 30 40 from their nominal value besides the designed controller parameters are given in table 1 and the initial condition of the auv considered for all simulation is as follows x y z φ θ ψ t 0 0 0 0 0 0 t u v w p q r t 0 0 0 0 0 0 t case 1 the desired sinusoidal trajectory p d t 50 sin 0 02 t 0 5 t 5 0 1 t t case 2 the desired spiral trajectory p d t 30 sin 0 04 t 30 cos 0 04 t 25 0 1 t t the simulation results in fig 6 and fig 10 illustrate that the proposed scheme always ensures the tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero regardless of using pid or bsm for the dynamic control see fig 8 besides fig 9 and fig 13 show that its control signals are always within the vehicle s physical limitations and applicable in practice however the performance of the proposed method depends on the capabilities of the algorithm applying for dynamic control specifically the bsm based dynamic controller has a smaller overall position error and a faster converging rate than the pid based dynamic controller although fig 7 and fig 11 demonstrate the proposed controllers yan s and zhou s reconstructed controllers perform consistently with the 6 dof auv model the bsm based dynamic controller has the most outstanding control quality such as the smallest tracking error and fastest convergence concerning the algorithm developed by yan et al 2019 due to the redundant element l cos θ cos ψ l cos θ sin ψ l sin θ t in the tracking error definition the steady error is always non zero and equal to l 0 5m as shown in figs 7 and 11 moreover choosing l 0 or too small can lead to the singularity of velocity command or instability of the whole system respectively turning into the zhou s controller because of the existence of v in α d the errors e y and e ψ cannot be zero simultaneously if v is non zero similar to the case of e z and e θ due to the presence of w in β d following this if either v or w is non zero the desired values r d and q d are erroneously and consequently cause a steady error for example it can be observed from fig 12 and fig 13 that there is a marked difference between the steady value of δ r of zhou s method compared to the other ones when v is non zero on the other hand it is noteworthy that the tracking error of the proposed novel scheme is always guaranteed to converge to the neighborhood of zero despite the deviation of parameters in f i g i i p q r u therefore these simulation results sufficiently validate the strong robustness the anti jamming ability of the proposed controller as well as the effectiveness and the disturbance estimation capability of established ndos through all the above results and analysis the proposed method demonstrates not only the eﬀectiveness feasibility robustness disturbances rejection ability against the coupled model nonlinearities model uncertainties and roll motion effect but also the superiority compared to the previous ones remark 4 as mentioned in remark 1 since this paper uses a simpler trajectory tracking error dynamics model the desired values in 16 are convenient to be determined than the previous methods therefore through the simulation results and note that pid is an easy algorithm to be implemented in practice it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm is a promising solution for further applications in reality 5 conclusions this paper provides a new approach to deal with the trajectory tracking control of an under actuated auv in the presence of highly uncertain nonlinear model features model uncertainty and roll motion s effect a novel control scheme is constructed by dividing the trajectory tracking problem into two sub problems namely kinematic control and dynamic control the kinematic control functions as the spatial tracking guidance that computes the desired values for surge velocity pitch angle and heading angle to ensure the vehicle converges to the desired trajectory the dynamic control is responsible

20861,this paper presents a study of precisely three dimensional 3 d trajectory tracking controller design for auv vehicles regarding to highly uncertain nonlinear model features internal external disturbances and roll motion s effect firstly the six degrees of freedom 6 dof nonlinear equations of motion are described subsequently a novel control scheme is proposed based on cascade structure

robustness of the proposed control scheme keywords under actuated auv 3 d trajectory tracking control model uncertainties back stepping sliding mode control nonlinear disturbances observers ndo control lyapunov function clf 1 introduction nowadays people increasingly pay attention to exploiting and searching for resources in the ocean because of the depletion of resources on the land therefore various marine equipment have been strongly developed in recent decades therein auv shows that it is not only one of the most popular applied underwater devices but also a significant role in scientific commercial and military applications these applications include offshore oil field exploration oceanographic mapping inspection of underwater structures anti submarine warfare oceanographic surveying and so on wynn et al 2014 gafurov and klochkov 2015 zhang et al 2015 mondal et al 2019 to accomplish the aforementioned tasks efficiently and accurately auvs often need to be maneuvered in three dimensional space especially for complex tasks it requires the satisfaction of both spatial and temporal constraints consequently the study of trajectory tracking control algorithms in three dimensional space has become a research hotspot in the control field however it is always a great challenge to design a reliable tracking controller due to highly coupled nonlinearities in the auv dynamic and the uncertainties in the ocean environments in the past two decades trajectory tracking control of underwater vehicles has been studied extensively but mostly solves problems in the planar such as repoulias and papadopoulos 2007 elmokadem et al 2016 2017 yan et al 2015 shen et al 2018 xia et al 2019 for horizontal plane and li and lee 2005 cao et al 2011 joe et al 2014 xia et al 2020 tran et al 2021 for vertical plane although these studies have successful results and promising for implementation in practice most of them cannot be extended to spatial trajectory tracking control yu et al 2019 at the same time plenty of research effort has been dedicated to the 3 d trajectory tracking problem and achieve some certain successes specifically qiao et al 2017 qiao and zhang 2019 liu et al 2020 gan et al 2018 used sliding mode control smc to build controller because it provides fast response and robustness to ensure bounded tracking error against un modeled dynamics and exogenous disturbances qiao et al 2017 proposed specific approaches including min max saturation and smooth transition one to control auv to precisely track a preset trajectory regarding to dynamic uncertainties and time varied perturbations in qiao and zhang 2019 an adaptive second order fast nonsingular terminal sliding mode control asofntsmc scheme was developed as to accurately tracking control a fully actuated auv in the presence of time varying noises in liu et al 2020 a quaternion based adaptive non singular terminal sliding mode control scheme was studied for trajectory tracking control problem of a typical fully actuated auv to ocean current and modeling uncertainty however the chattering phenomenon in sliding mode control hasn t been resolved in the above three papers gan et al 2018 designed a model predictive control mpc method based on quantum behaved particle swarm optimization qpso combining with sliding mode control for the dynamic trajectory tracking problem of unmanned underwater vehicle uuv in this paper qpso mpc was utilized to design a kinematic controller and limit the velocity of vehicle within a specified range to handle the speed jump problem while smc was adopted in dynamic control besides smc the backstepping techniques and lyapunov s direct method are also especially prevalent for the development of trajectory tracking controllers aguiar and hespanha 2007 rezazadegan et al 2015 li et al 2015 karkoub et al 2017 zhou et al 2018 von ellenrieder 2019 aguiar and hespanha 2007 presented adaptive switching supervisory control combined with a nonlinear lyapunov based tracking control law to solve the trajectory tracking and path following problem for under actuated autonomous vehicles in the presence of possibly large modeling parametric uncertainty in rezazadegan et al 2015 an adaptive controller based on lyapunov s direct method and the back stepping technique was developed to guarantee robustness against parameter uncertainties for the trajectory tracking control of the 5 dof auv model one drawback however is that the computational process of control laws in this paper proves too complex li et al 2015 introduced the control algorithm that uses the vehicle s kinematic equation and linear system stability theory to obtain the velocity error dynamics then back stepping techniques were adopted to force the tracking error to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero nevertheless the simulation results show that the proposed control law has not helped q and r converge to the desired value thereby leads to the position error not converging to zero a hierarchical robust nonlinear hrn controller which utilizes the back stepping and sliding mode control technique with hierarchical structure based on the kinematic and dynamic models of the system was discovered by karkoub et al 2017 to solve the trajectory tracking problem of auv with multiple uncertainties e g current disturbances un modeled dynamics and parameter variations although the simulation results demonstrate the controller s effectiveness and feasibility the application of this algorithm is limited to specific vehicles because most auvs only stabilize the roll angle instead of control zhou et al 2018 developed a three dimensional tracking controller for under actuated auvs with velocity regulation and back stepping technique this controller utilizes the bio inspired models for surge velocity error and angular velocity errors to overcome the frequently occurring problem of parameter skip at an inflection point and the singularity problem existing in the back stepping tracking control method as well as increase system robustness the simulation results show that the controller not only overcomes the skipping problem at inflection points but also avoids the singularity problem nevertheless the overall error value between the desired and actual trajectories has a steady state quite large in von ellenrieder 2019 an approach similar to back stepping allowing one to avoid the explosion of complexity by using first order filters to compute the derivatives of the system namely dynamic surface control dsc was adopted to design an n degree of freedom nonlinear control law for the trajectory tracking of marine vehicles in this paper the author used a disturbance observer to handle the unknown time varying disturbances as well as addressed saturated input moreover there exist other methods which are applied to solve the 3 d trajectory tracking problem for auv for example there are adaptive control aguiar and hespanha 2007 yan et al 2019 qiao and zhang 2019a 2019b kumar and rani 2020 model predictive control gan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 yan et al 2020 neural network shojaei and arefi2015 wang et al 2019 kumar and rani 2020 as an overall judgment it could be said that most of the previously mentioned research works considered the 3 d trajectory tracking problem for fully actuated auvs and only a few of the papers are about the 3 d trajectory tracking for under actuated auvs aguiar and hespanha 2007 rezazadegan et al 2015 li et al 2015 shojaei and arefi 2015 zhou et al 2018 yan et al 2019 wang et al 2019 although the above studies have conferred new tools and promising solutions for the 3 d trajectory tracking problem they often raise the complexity of the controller structure and make them restricted to apply in practice yi et al 2016 on the other hand the algorithms that the authors consider for fully actuated auvs are hardly to apply widely since conventional auvs have a slender torpedo shape for speed and efficiency and are an under actuated system besides there is an alternate point of view to consider in the 3 d trajectory tracking problem studies mentioned above is the authors have usually neglected the roll motion for simplicity and return the problem to 5 dof for controller design stability analysis and simulation unfortunately that the torpedo shaped auvs have a small moment of inertia and drag in the roll motion so the roll dynamic easily suffers oscillatory when auvs are affected by propeller torque unknown disturbances yaw and pitch motion therefore if the controller building process doesn t consider the roll motion it can lead to the deterioration of the control quality or even cause instability for the whole system prompted by these observations this paper focuses on developing a novel control scheme with less computational complexity using lyapunov s direct method and the cascade approach for the 3 d trajectory tracking control of under actuated auvs in the presence of model uncertainties and roll motion s effect the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the cascade approach is employed to divide the trajectory tracking problem into two sub problems namely kinematic and dynamic control in order to simplify and reduce the complexity of the proposed algorithm while preserving the stability of the whole system in the presence of roll motion and model uncertainties in the kinematic control the 6 dof kinematic equation of auv and lyapunov s direct method are utilized to compute the desired values for surge velocity pitch angle and heading angle to force the trajectory tracking error to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero in this way many different algorithms can be applied for the dynamic control to design attitude and velocity controllers to track the desired values calculated from the kinematic control therefore the proposed algorithm can facilely apply advanced or optimal algorithms to increase the performance of the whole system or solve many extensive problems such as ocean current input constraint sensor failure 2 four nonlinear disturbance observers ndo are built to compensate for the errors in the linearization process and the uncertainties in the 6 dof dynamic model of auv when designing attitude and velocity controllers 3 the lyapunov concept is adopted to demonstrate the uniformly ultimately bounded convergence of all closed loop signals besides the robustness feasibility and efficiency of the novel control scheme are examined and verified via plenty of numerical simulations the rest of this study is structured as follows section 2 introduces the auv 6 dof structure in which focuses on the trajectory tracking error features and formulates the control problem section 3 presents the novel 3 d trajectory tracking control scheme design of proposed nonlinear disturbance observer ndo and the detailed building and proving process of the kinematic and dynamic controller in section 4 the proposed control scheme is verified via various numerical simulations with analysis eventually section 5 delineates conclusions 2 auv implementation 2 1 model of under actuated auv the model will be considered in this paper is the hybrid auv2000 mentioned in tran et al 2021 at first the earth fixed frame e and the body fixed

3 problem formulation the control objective is to maneuver the under actuated auv for precisely tracking the predefined three dimensional trajectory with respect to the coupled model nonlinearities model uncertainties and roll motion effect moreover as to be efficient in implementing the controller the objective is divided into the following two control sub problems 1 kinematic control given a desired three dimensional trajectory the trajectory tracking errors dynamics 11 and assume that the roll angle is stabilized by the roll controller design the guidance law to provide the desired surge velocity u d desired pitch angle θ d desired heading angle ψ d so that the trajectory tracking errors in 7 converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero in case t 2 dynamic control given the desired surge velocity u d desired pitch angle θ d desired heading angle ψ d and the dynamic model 2 build the control laws x p r o p x g y g and δ r to guarantee the tracking errors u u d θ θ d ψ ψ d and φ converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero in case t with respect to the highly coupled system nonlinearities and model uncertainties to solve the problem of the controller design presented below it is necessary to assume that assumption 1 the desired three dimensional trajectory is finitely determined as to ensure x d y d z d x d y d and z d strictly bounded assumption 2 the model uncertainties and the linearization errors are bounded so there exists positive constants d u d p d q and d r such that the following conditions are satisfied d u d u d p d p d q d q and d r d r assumption 3 the linear and angular velocities of auv are bounded during operation 3 proposed control scheme implementation 3 1 framing of the novel controller as mentioned above the paper focuses on developing a novel control scheme based on the cascade structure where the 3 d trajectory tracking problem is divided into two subsystems namely kinematic control and dynamic control as shown in fig 3 in kinematic control to guarantee the trajectory tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero as t goes to infinity the lyapunov s direct method is adopted to generate the desired values for surge velocity pitch angle and heading angle compare with the previous study because the proposed method has a simpler trajectory tracking error dynamics model the calculation procedure and the desired values for dynamic control are less complicated therefore the proposed method improves the applicability in practice while ensuring the efficiency and accuracy of the convergence to the desired trajectory in dynamic control the main task is to build controllers to stabilize the roll angle and track the desired values calculated from kinematic control including attitude controller and velocity controller to achieve favorable tracking control against the linearization errors and model uncertainties the nonlinear disturbance observer ndo is utilized compare with the previous study because the proposed method allows any algorithm to design the attitude controllers and the velocity controller advanced and optimal algorithms can be easily applied to enhance the tracking performance converging rate and robustness on the other hand it is also accessible to upgrade to deal with other complex problems such as ocean current input constraint sensor failure to point out this superiority this paper uses two algorithms pid and back stepping sliding mode control bsm to build the controller then compare analyze and evaluate the obtained results 3 2 proposed ndo

distance k 1 k 2 0 are the control gains theorem 1 assume that the desired trajectory satisfies assumption 1 the roll angle is bounded during movement and converge to a neighborhood of zero by the roll stabilization controller then the guidance law 16 guarantees that the trajectory tracking errors 7 is bounded and convergent to a specified compact set around the origin if u θ ψ converge to the

matrix consequently within finite time the norm of the trajectory tracking error vector p e is bounded by 26 p e n m λ max n λ min m max δ h 1 δ h 2 δ h 3 min k 1 u p s e y e 2 δ h 2 k 2 where λ max n and λ min m denote the maximum eigenvalue of n and the smallest eigenvalue of m respectively moreover h i i 1 2 3 will converge to zero if u θ ψ converge to the desired values thus it can be concluded from 26 that the trajectory tracking errors 7 is bounded and convergent to a compact value around the origin remark 2 because of the assumption that the roll angle is stabilized and converges to a neighborhood of zero rewriting the kinematic equation 6 has made i the trajectory tracking error dynamics 7 classified the components p x e p y e h z e related to the roll angle ii the analysis of the upper bound of p x e p y e h z e easier iii the proof of theorem 1 more clear and coherent remark 3 from theorem 1 it is clear that trajectory tracking error vector p e will not converge to zero unless the tracking errors of dynamic controller can be eliminated completely however the trajectory tracking errors can be made arbitrarily small by tuning the look ahead distance δ h and the control

implemented to evaluate the eﬀiciency feasibility and robustness of the novel control scheme to point out the superiority of the proposed method the following four controllers are compared 1 the proposed scheme with bsm applied for dynamic control marked as the bsm based dynamic controller 2 the proposed scheme with pid applied for dynamic control marked as the pid based dynamic controller it means that the dynamic control part included roll pid controller pitch pid controller heading pd controller and surge pid controller 3 the sliding mode controller is based on the algorithm proposed in yan et al 2019 which has the block diagram shown in fig 4 marked as yan s controller 4 the back stepping controller is based on the algorithm proposed in zhou et al 2018 which has the block diagram shown in fig 5 marked as zhou s controller to ensure objectivity and completeness of the comparison the vehicle is expected to track different desired trajectories included sinusoidal trajectory and spiral trajectory in all case studies to demonstrate the disturbance estimation capability anti jamming ability of proposed controllers under model uncertainties the parameters of f i g i i p q r u in formula 4 are varied by 30 40 from their nominal value besides the designed controller parameters are given in table 1 and the initial condition of the auv considered for all simulation is as follows x y z φ θ ψ t 0 0 0 0 0 0 t u v w p q r t 0 0 0 0 0 0 t case 1 the desired sinusoidal trajectory p d t 50 sin 0 02 t 0 5 t 5 0 1 t t case 2 the desired spiral trajectory p d t 30 sin 0 04 t 30 cos 0 04 t 25 0 1 t t the simulation results in fig 6 and fig 10 illustrate that the proposed scheme always ensures the tracking errors converge to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero regardless of using pid or bsm for the dynamic control see fig 8 besides fig 9 and fig 13 show that its control signals are always within the vehicle s physical limitations and applicable in practice however the performance of the proposed method depends on the capabilities of the algorithm applying for dynamic control specifically the bsm based dynamic controller has a smaller overall position error and a faster converging rate than the pid based dynamic controller although fig 7 and fig 11 demonstrate the proposed controllers yan s and zhou s reconstructed controllers perform consistently with the 6 dof auv model the bsm based dynamic controller has the most outstanding control quality such as the smallest tracking error and fastest convergence concerning the algorithm developed by yan et al 2019 due to the redundant element l cos θ cos ψ l cos θ sin ψ l sin θ t in the tracking error definition the steady error is always non zero and equal to l 0 5m as shown in figs 7 and 11 moreover choosing l 0 or too small can lead to the singularity of velocity command or instability of the whole system respectively turning into the zhou s controller because of the existence of v in α d the errors e y and e ψ cannot be zero simultaneously if v is non zero similar to the case of e z and e θ due to the presence of w in β d following this if either v or w is non zero the desired values r d and q d are erroneously and consequently cause a steady error for example it can be observed from fig 12 and fig 13 that there is a marked difference between the steady value of δ r of zhou s method compared to the other ones when v is non zero on the other hand it is noteworthy that the tracking error of the proposed novel scheme is always guaranteed to converge to the neighborhood of zero despite the deviation of parameters in f i g i i p q r u therefore these simulation results sufficiently validate the strong robustness the anti jamming ability of the proposed controller as well as the effectiveness and the disturbance estimation capability of established ndos through all the above results and analysis the proposed method demonstrates not only the eﬀectiveness feasibility robustness disturbances rejection ability against the coupled model nonlinearities model uncertainties and roll motion effect but also the superiority compared to the previous ones remark 4 as mentioned in remark 1 since this paper uses a simpler trajectory tracking error dynamics model the desired values in 16 are convenient to be determined than the previous methods therefore through the simulation results and note that pid is an easy algorithm to be implemented in practice it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm is a promising solution for further applications in reality 5 conclusions this paper provides a new approach to deal with the trajectory tracking control of an under actuated auv in the presence of highly uncertain nonlinear model features model uncertainty and roll motion s effect a novel control scheme is constructed by dividing the trajectory tracking problem into two sub problems namely kinematic control and dynamic control the kinematic control functions as the spatial tracking guidance that computes the desired values for surge velocity pitch angle and heading angle to ensure the vehicle converges to the desired trajectory the dynamic control is responsible for calculating the control laws to drive the auv tracking the desired values provided by the kinematic control the dynamic controller employs back stepping sliding control approach to ensure the accuracy of the tracking performance adopts the nonlinear disturbance observer ndo to ameliorate the anti jamming ability and robustness for the whole system besides the stability of the proposed controller is considered and proved by the lyapunov analysis moreover the feasibility eﬀectiveness disturbances rejection ability and robustness of the controller are demonstrated and validated

load eccentricity soil parameters and frequencies of excitation these results show the values of base forces are notable only when the pile s aspect ratio is very small besides an interesting phenomenon is found ignoring the base effects will only lead to a negligible influence on pile impedances and responses even when the pile s aspect ratio is very small the reason is that the pile shaft near the base in the no base effect model will take the stresses the base bears in the with base effect model the pile s overall responses and impedances are not sensitive to the detailed stress distributions around the pile base in this elasto dynamic problem keywords offshore wind turbines monopile foundation base shear base moment pile soil interaction 1 introduction the most popular methods to depict lateral behavior of piles include sub grade modulus methods commonly known as p y curve method e g matlock and reese 1960 reese et al 1974 semi analytical method using mindlin s equations or green s functions e g poulos 1971 kaynia and kausel 1982 poulos and davis 1991 and numerical based methods e g finite element method used in randolph 1981 brown and shie 1990 kim and jeong 2011 due to its simplicity p y curve method which connect the lateral soil resistance p and the corresponding lateral displacement y along the pile depth is recommended by many offshore codes and regulations api 2014 dnv 2011 however only the lateral forces along the pile shaft are fully considered which is not suitable for the widely used monopiles achmus et al 2009 bourgeois et al 2010 sørensen et al 2010 leblanc et al 2010 hokmabadi et al 2012 negro et al 2014 byrne et al 2015 he et al 2019a 2019b compared to traditional piles the largest difference is that traditional piles are often slender flexible piles while offshore monopiles are mostly stumpy rigid or semi rigid piles the relatively large rigidity of monopiles make their interaction with the soil quite different from traditional piles similar difficulties also exist for semi analytical methods most of them are not able to obtain the base forces shear force and bending moment and base motions displacement and rotation simultaneously as they use the classical beam theory in which the boundary conditions at the pile base only permits two of the above four quantities refer to fig 1 where f z is the distributed force along the pile numerical methods can obtain vertical stresses lateral forces base forces and base motions simultaneously however they often take long computation time for engineering design there are several new models to consider the lateral behavior of monopiles including a four spring stresses forces model proposed in the pisa project byrne et al 2015 zdravkovic et al 2015 which uses a 1d model verified by 3d finite element computations the four stresses forces consist of lateral distributed force f z and moment m z base shear h l and base moment m l refer to fig 2 a b two springs model proposed in he et al 2019a which considers both the lateral distributed forces and moments but ignore the base shear and moment fig 2b c two springs model proposed in zhang et al 2019 which considers both the lateral distributed forces and base shear fig 2c d two springs model proposed in wang et al 2020 which is formulated by lateral distributed force above the rotation point together with a moment m r at the rotation point of the pile fig 2d three of these models are developed for static problem that is byrne et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 while that of he et al 2019a is for dynamic problems however it can not consider the base effect on the dynamic lateral behavior of monopiles this issue is the focus of this study in this study we first propose an analytical model based on green s functions and beam theory which accounts for the base effect of monopiles this model is then used to study the lateral behaviors of monopiles and the influence of pile aspect ratio loading eccentricity ratio pile soil modulus ratio pile wall thickness to radius ratio and non dimensional loading frequency finally the results of the model are compared with those that ignored the base effect he et al 2019a and several practical and useful conclusions are drawn from them poroelasticity is chosen in offshore applications as it allows the dynamic interaction between the soil skeletons and pore fluids while traditional linear elastic soil model cannot model the influence of pore fluid in the saturated soils the advantage of poroelasticity is that it includes one phase elastic material as a special case besides the visco poroelasticity can also consider the additional influence of hysteresis damping due to internal friction of soil particles 2 description of the method when the top of a monopile is subjected to a combined horizontal force h 0 e i ω t and a moment m 0 e i ω t these forces are resisted by lateral reaction forces and moments along the pile together with the shear force and bending moment at the pile tip the term e i ω t will be omitted below for simplicity the radius wall thickness and embedded length of the monopile are denoted by a h and l respectively perfect contact between the soil and pile is assumed during the pile vibration this is a realistic assumption for monopile design the proposed method is depicted by fig 3 the four components of stresses forces are divided into two parts 1 a pile shaft with a free base accounts for the distributed reaction forces and moment and 2 a pile base point accounts for the shear force and bending moment at the tip ring load green s functions fig 4 a are used to analyze the pile soil interaction problem ring loads can be used conveniently to discretize both the pile shaft and pile base in order to use these three dimensional 3d ring load green s functions the one dimensional 1d pile shaft can be represented by a 3d shell with a very small thickness fig 4b and the zero dimensional 0d pile base point is represented by a two dimensional 2d annular disk with a zero height fig 4c the stresses forces on the pile shaft and pile base can be obtained by considering the displacement compatibility conditions at the corresponding boundaries which are explained in detail in section 4 3 governing equations and green s functions governing equations for soil and monopile

point in order to avoid the singularities the displacement calculation points are chosen to be at different positions but very close to the force calculation point fig 5 a similar to the method used in randolph 1977 in order to consider the effect of base stresses on the deformation of the pile shaft using beam theory the base stress distributed along the r direction are transformed to stresses distributed along the z direction in the shaft element close to the tip based on the principle of force balance refer to fig 5b where δ z and δ r are the length of the shaft element and bottom element

numerical results the fredholm integral equation 17 can be solved numerically compared to the pure numerical method e g finite element method the special advantage of this semi analytical method is 3d dynamic interaction problem has been transferred to 1d problem and only 1d element is needed discretization in z direction for pile shaft and discretization in r direction for pile base which will save a lot of computation time in section 5 2 and 5 3 some numerical results are given a homogeneous soil condition is assumed with the parameters representing a clay site the material properties of the soil are given in table 1 where b is skempton s pore pressure coefficient ν and ν u are the drained and undrained poisson s ratio for the soil respectively the parameters r q and b can be obtained from the expressions given by rice and cleary 1976 5 1 comparison with fem solutions to verify the proposed method we compare the results obtained here with the solutions obtained using the finite element method fem the fem results are obtained by a numerical model by the authors using opensees http opensees berkeley edu the static solution for a monopile embedded in a single phased elastic soil can be obtained by setting b n ρ f and ω in this study to small values fig 6 a and b displays the variations of the computed shear force and bending moment along a monopile with l a 2 respectively good agreement is observed between the two solutions in fig 6 which validates the model proposed in this study the results are presented in normalized form with the actual parameters listed on the figures 5 2 parameter analysis 5 2 1 influence of pile aspect ratio to study the influence of pile aspect ratio four different aspect ratios are chosen a small frequency f 0 3 hz is chosen which is a typical fundamental frequency for offshore wind turbines moreover the imaginary parts would be very small and are omitted here for simplicity the influence of pile aspect ratio on real part of the pile responses is shown in fig 7 from which we can make the following observations 1 pile with l a 6 behaves like a semi rigid pile and pile with l a 30 behaves like a flexible pile fig 7a while the behaviors of pile with l a 10 and l a 16 transform from rigid pile to flexible pile 2 with the increase of pile aspect ratio the pile s responses including lateral displacement rotation distributed reaction forces distributed reaction moment shear force and moment move towards the upper part of the pile fig 7a d 3 base shear decreases with increase of pile aspect ratio and base shear for pile with length larger than 16 a is practically 0 fig 7e 4 base moment is very small even for pile with a very small aspect ratio l a 6 and the moment decrease to practically 0 when l a is larger than 10 5 2 2 influence of load eccentricity four different load eccentricity ratios e h a are used to show the effect of load eccentricity on monopile s responses from the definition of e h it can be found that the pile s responses are dominated by lateral force when e h a is close to 0 and the influence of moment increases with the increase of e h and the pile s responses will be governed by the moment when e h is large enough the results in fig 8 show that 1 it seems that pile s behavior can change from semi rigid to flexible with the increase of load eccentricity fig 8a and b 2 all the response quantities including pile displacement rotation distributed reaction forces distributed reaction moment shear force and moment increases with the increase of e h 3 besides the base shear and moment also increase with the increase of e h although all of the base moments are very small 5 2 3 influence of pile thickness to radius ratio choosing an appropriate pile thickness is an important design issue four thickness to radius ratios are used here to study the effect of pile thickness on monopile responses compared to the value h 0 00635 0 02 a suggested by api 2014 h 0 01 a used here is apparently too small and h 0 04 a may be too large however they re considered here to illustrate the effect of pile thickness the results in fig 9 show that 1 increasing the pile thickness from h 0 01 a to h 0 02 a will reduce both displacement and rotation at the top ending of pile to a large extent fig 9a and b but further increase in thickness will have much smaller benefit 2 the shape of the distributed lateral force is similar to the shape of the lateral displacement while the shape of the distributed moment is similar to the shape of the rotation fig 9a d 3 the distributed lateral force is not sensitive to the wall thickness when h 0 02 a fig 9c 4 increasing the thickness will decrease the distributed lateral force and moment along the pile in general fig 9c and d 5 increasing thickness will decrease the maximal shear force in the pile and the location of the maximum point will move downward fig 9e 6 increasing thickness will increase the moment along the pile fig 9f 5 2 4 influence of soil s elastic modulus five values of soil s elastic modulus are chosen to study the influence of soil modulus from very soft clay to stiff clay e s 10 mpa e s 40 mpa e s 80 mpa e s 160 mpa and e s 320 mpa the results are illustrated in fig 10 in non dimensional form it can be found in fig 10 that 1 all the deformation curves pass through the same two points z 0 15 l and z 0 75 l in all the 5 soil cases fig 10a in order to see whether this mechanism exists in other cases three more cases are added monopile with the same aspect ratio l a 10 but a different load eccentricity ratio e h a 20 and monopile with two different aspect ratios l a 6 and l a 16 the results in fig 10b 10 d indicate that the phenomenon s present for all the semi rigid monopiles however the locations of the two points are not fixed the locations move upward with the increase of pile aspect ratio for a monopile with a fixed aspect ratio the change of soil modulus or load eccentricity will not change the locations 2 both the non dimensional displacement and rotation at the top ending of pile increase with the decrease of pile soil modulus ratio fig 10a e 3 distributed lateral forces become larger at the location above the lower rotation point and become smaller below the lower rotation point when the clay becomes harder fig 10f 4 distributed moments along the pile become larger in the upper part and smaller in the lower part when the clay becomes harder fig 10g 5 the maximal shear force in the pile will increase and the location of the maximum point will move upward with the increase of clay s elastic modulus fig 10h 6 the moment along the pile will drop with the increase of clay s elastic modulus fig 10i 5 2 5 influence of loading frequency loading frequency is important for monopile s responses as offshore monopiles are subjected to loads with different frequencies such as winds waves operating forces and earthquake loadings in order to study the influence of loading frequencies 5 different frequencies are chosen f 0 01 hz f 0 3 hz f 1 hz and f 5 hz these correspond respectively to quasi static load or the frequency of wind frequency of wave or the first resonant frequency of wind turbine the second resonant frequency of wind turbine and a typical earthquake loading frequency the corresponding non dimensional amplitude of the results are illustrated in fig 11 from which the following observations can be made 1 the results for f 0 01 hz f 0 3 hz and f 1 hz are very close for all the responses and the results in theses frequencies can be treated as quasi static responses 2 the results for f 5 hz are quite different namely the lateral displacement rotation distributed lateral force distributed moment and shear force at the lower part of the pile become larger to the quasi static case the largest shear force shows an increase of 15 compared to the quasi static case and the location for the largest shear force point moves downward 3 the moment along the whole pile at f 5 hz is larger than that at quasi static case 5 3 comparison with the model without base the effect of the base can be considered using the proposed model in this study however compared to the no base effect model in he et al 2019a inclusion of the base effect requires a more complex model and more computer times moreover the accurate values of base shear and base moment for monopiles are very difficult to obtain in field or model tests therefore the question is if it is possible to ignore the base effect i e ignore base shear and base moment to answer this question the pile responses and dynamic impedances obtained using the with base effect model here are compared with the no base effect model in he et al 2019a in the following sections 5 3 1 pile responses the pile responses obtained from the two models i e with and without base are illustrated in fig 12 from which one can conclude the following 1 the lateral displacements and rotations obtained in the two models are practically identical fig 12a and b especially in the larger aspect ratio case l a 10 2 the shear forces and moments along the pile are also very close in the two models except at the pile tip where the shear force and moment are zero in the no base effect case while they are non zero in the with base effect case fig 12c and d 3 the reason that the responses are almost equal in the two models are the bottom stresses in the with base effect model are transferred to the pile shaft in the no base effect model the pile soil is in a state of high order statically indeterminate system the result shows that the pile s responses are not sensitive to the detailed stress distributions around the pile tip the stress transfer from the base to the shaft mechanism will make the distributed lateral force and moment at the shaft near the base become much larger in the no base case as shown in fig 12e and f 5 3 2 dynamic impedances the comparison of dynamic impedances in the two cases with and without effect of base are illustrated in fig 13 there are two kinds of impedances introduced one is obtained by applying a unit force at the pile head k h k m h k m and the other is obtained by imposing a unit displacement at the pile head k h k m h k m all the impedances are presented in non dimensional form he et al 2019b 19 w x 0 ϕ 0 1 k h 1 k m h 1 k m h 1 k m h 0 m 0 h 0 m 0 k h k m h k m h k m w x 0 ϕ 0 k h k h μ s a k m h k m h μ s a 2 k m k m μ s a 3 k h k h μ s a k m h k m h μ s a 2 k m k m μ s a 3 the results show that all the impedance terms in the two cases are almost identical and that consideration of the base has practically no effect on the results through the comparisons of the pile responses and impedances in the two models it can be found that the influence of the base is localized to the pile shaft near the base and it will not change the pile head displacement pile head rotation the largest shear force the largest moment along the pile and the dynamic impedances this phenomenon is caused by the stress transfer from the base to the shaft mechanism 6 conclusions a semi analytical model which can obtain the base shear base moment base displacement and base rotation simultaneously is proposed pile responses including pile displacement rotation distributed lateral force distributed moment shear force and moment along the pile are obtained using the proposed model the influences of the pile length load eccentricity pile thickness soil modulus and loading frequency are analyzed in detail using this model besides a comparison with the no base effect model is also conducted in this paper and the following conclusions can be made 1 the base shear force is noteworthy in the monopile with a small aspect ratio e g l a 10 and getting unapparent in the pile with larger aspect ratios 2 the bottom moment is insignificant even in the monopile with a very low aspect ratio l a 6 3 the effect of loading frequency on the pile responses is not important when the frequency is small e g f 1 hz or ω 0 15 and the pile s responses can be treated as quasi static on the other hand the dynamic responses should be considered when the loading frequency is higher 4 the effect of bottom shear and bottom moment is limited to the pile shaft close to the bottom and has almost negligible influence on the overall responses of the monopile this is caused by the mechanism that the bottom stresses will transfer to the pile shaft if there s no explicit bottom considered and the overall responses of the pile are not sensitive to the redistribution of the stresses note that all the results are obtained within the small strain and pile soil in full contact hypotheses the results can only be used when the soil is not strongly non linear that is the wind turbines are in normal operation conditions and whether these results are suitable for other cases needs further researches credit authorship

20862,the base shear and moment may play important roles in behaviors of offshore monopiles and traditional p y curves cannot model the base forces in this study a new semi analytical model for monopile is proposed from which base forces and displacements can all be obtained simultaneously green s functions for poro visco elastic soil and timoshenko beam are used full bond between pile and soil is assumed which means the results are suitable for the normal operating conditions for offshore wind turbines selected numerical results are examined for different pile lengths pile thickness load eccentricity soil parameters and frequencies of excitation these results show the values of base forces are notable only when the pile s aspect ratio is very small besides an interesting phenomenon is found ignoring the base effects will only lead to a negligible influence on pile impedances and responses even when the pile s aspect ratio is very small the reason is that the pile shaft near the base in the no base effect model will take the stresses the base bears in the with base effect model the pile s overall responses and impedances are not sensitive to the detailed stress distributions around the pile base in this elasto dynamic problem keywords offshore wind turbines monopile foundation base shear base moment pile soil interaction 1 introduction the most popular methods to depict lateral behavior of piles include sub grade modulus methods commonly known as p y curve method e g matlock and reese 1960 reese et al 1974 semi analytical method using mindlin s equations or green s functions e g poulos 1971 kaynia and kausel 1982 poulos and davis 1991 and numerical based methods e g finite element method used in randolph 1981 brown and shie 1990 kim and jeong 2011 due to its simplicity p y curve method which connect the lateral soil resistance p and the corresponding lateral displacement y along the pile depth is recommended by many offshore codes and regulations api 2014 dnv 2011 however only the lateral forces along the pile shaft are fully considered which is not suitable for the widely used monopiles achmus et al 2009 bourgeois et al 2010 sørensen et al 2010 leblanc et al 2010 hokmabadi et al 2012 negro et al 2014 byrne et al 2015 he et al 2019a 2019b compared to traditional piles the largest difference is that traditional piles are often slender flexible piles while offshore monopiles are mostly stumpy rigid or semi rigid piles the relatively large rigidity of monopiles make their interaction with the soil quite different from traditional piles similar difficulties also exist for semi analytical methods most of them are not able to obtain the base forces shear force and bending moment and base motions displacement and rotation simultaneously as they use the classical beam theory in which the boundary conditions at the pile base only permits two of the above four quantities refer to fig 1 where f z is the distributed force along the pile numerical methods can obtain vertical stresses lateral forces base forces and base motions simultaneously however they often take long computation time for engineering design there are several new models to consider the lateral behavior of monopiles including a four spring stresses forces model proposed in the pisa project byrne et al 2015 zdravkovic et al 2015 which uses a 1d model verified by 3d finite element computations the four stresses forces consist of lateral distributed force f z and moment m z base shear h l and base moment m l refer to fig 2 a b two springs model proposed in he et al 2019a which considers both the lateral distributed forces and moments but ignore the base shear and moment fig 2b c two springs model proposed in zhang et al 2019 which considers both the lateral distributed forces and base shear fig 2c d two springs model proposed in wang et al 2020 which is formulated by lateral distributed force above the rotation point together with a moment m r at the rotation point of the pile fig 2d three of these models are developed for static problem that is byrne et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 wang et al 2020 while that of he et al 2019a is for dynamic problems however it can not consider the base effect on the dynamic lateral behavior of monopiles this issue is the focus of this study in this study we first propose an analytical model based on green s functions and beam theory which accounts for the base effect of monopiles this model is then used to study the lateral behaviors of monopiles and the influence of pile aspect ratio loading eccentricity ratio pile soil modulus ratio pile wall thickness to radius ratio and non dimensional loading frequency finally the results of the model are compared with those that ignored the base effect he et al 2019a and several practical and useful conclusions are drawn from them poroelasticity is chosen in offshore applications as it allows the dynamic interaction between the soil skeletons and pore fluids while traditional linear elastic soil model cannot model the influence of pore fluid in the saturated soils the advantage of poroelasticity is that it includes one phase elastic material as a special case besides the visco poroelasticity can also consider the additional influence of hysteresis damping due to internal friction of soil particles 2 description of the method when the top of a monopile is subjected to a combined horizontal force h 0 e i ω t and a moment m 0 e i ω t these forces are resisted by lateral reaction forces and moments along the pile together with the shear force and bending moment at the pile tip the term e i ω t will be omitted below for simplicity the radius wall thickness and embedded length of the monopile are denoted by a h and l respectively perfect contact between the soil and pile is assumed during the pile vibration this is a realistic assumption for monopile design the proposed method is depicted by fig 3 the four components of stresses forces are divided into two parts 1 a pile shaft with a free base accounts for the distributed reaction forces and moment and 2 a pile base point accounts for the shear force and bending moment at the tip ring load green s functions fig 4 a are used to analyze the pile soil interaction problem ring loads can be used conveniently to discretize both the pile shaft and pile base in order to use these three dimensional 3d ring load green s functions the one dimensional 1d pile shaft can be represented by a 3d shell with a very small thickness fig 4b and the zero dimensional 0d pile base point is represented by a two dimensional 2d annular disk with a zero height fig 4c the stresses forces on the pile shaft and pile base can be obtained by considering the displacement compatibility conditions at the corresponding boundaries which are explained in detail in section 4 3 governing equations and green s functions governing equations for soil and monopile are given in this section green s functions can be obtained with the governing equations and the corresponding boundary conditions described in the following 3 1 governing equations for monopile to

point in order to avoid the singularities the displacement calculation points are chosen to be at different positions but very close to the force calculation point fig 5 a similar to the method used in randolph 1977 in order to consider the effect of base stresses on the deformation of the pile shaft using beam theory the base stress distributed along the r direction are transformed to stresses distributed along the z direction in the shaft element close to the tip based on the principle of force balance refer to fig 5b where δ z and δ r are the length of the shaft element and bottom element respectively with the base stress transformation the displacements of pile can be obtained with the pile s green s functions 12 w i a θ z m r θ z 0 l w i m a θ z a θ s p m ρ a θ s d s m b r b θ b z r

numerical results the fredholm integral equation 17 can be solved numerically compared to the pure numerical method e g finite element method the special advantage of this semi analytical method is 3d dynamic interaction problem has been transferred to 1d problem and only 1d element is needed discretization in z direction for pile shaft and discretization in r direction for pile base which will save a lot of computation time in section 5 2 and 5 3 some numerical results are given a homogeneous soil condition is assumed with the parameters representing a clay site the material properties of the soil are given in table 1 where b is skempton s pore pressure coefficient ν and ν u are the drained and undrained poisson s ratio for the soil respectively the parameters r q and b can be obtained from the expressions given by rice and cleary 1976 5 1 comparison with fem solutions to verify the proposed method we compare the results obtained here with the solutions obtained using the finite element method fem the fem results are obtained by a numerical model by the authors using opensees http opensees berkeley edu the static solution for a monopile embedded in a single phased elastic soil can be obtained by setting b n ρ f and ω in this study to small values fig 6 a and b displays the variations of the computed shear force and bending moment along a monopile with l a 2 respectively good agreement is observed between the two solutions in fig 6 which validates the model proposed in this study the results are presented in normalized form with the actual parameters listed on the figures 5 2 parameter analysis 5 2 1 influence of pile aspect ratio to study the influence of pile aspect ratio four different aspect ratios are chosen a small frequency f 0 3 hz is chosen which is a typical fundamental frequency for offshore wind turbines moreover the imaginary parts would be very small and are omitted here for simplicity the influence of pile aspect ratio on real part of the pile responses is shown in fig 7 from which we can make the following observations 1 pile with l a 6 behaves like a semi rigid pile and pile with l a 30 behaves like a flexible pile fig 7a while the behaviors of pile with l a 10 and l a 16 transform from rigid pile to flexible pile 2 with the increase of pile aspect ratio the pile s responses including lateral displacement rotation distributed reaction forces distributed reaction moment shear force and moment move towards the upper part of the pile fig 7a d 3 base shear decreases with increase of pile aspect ratio and base shear for pile with length larger than 16 a is practically 0 fig 7e 4 base moment is very small even for pile with a very small aspect ratio l a 6 and the moment decrease to practically 0 when l a is larger than 10 5 2 2 influence of load eccentricity four different load eccentricity ratios e h a are used to show the effect of load eccentricity on monopile s responses from the definition of e h it can be found that the pile s responses are dominated by lateral force when e h a is close to 0 and the influence of moment increases with the increase of e h and the pile s responses will be governed by the moment when e h is large enough the results in fig 8 show that 1 it seems that pile s behavior can change from semi rigid to flexible with the increase of load eccentricity fig 8a and b 2 all the response quantities including pile displacement rotation distributed reaction forces distributed reaction moment shear force and moment increases with the increase of e h 3 besides the base shear and moment also increase with the increase of e h although all of the base moments are very small 5 2 3 influence of pile thickness to radius ratio choosing an appropriate pile thickness is an important design issue four thickness to radius ratios are used here to study the effect of pile thickness on monopile responses compared to the value h 0 00635 0 02 a suggested by api 2014 h 0 01 a used here is apparently too small and h 0 04 a may be too large however they re considered here to illustrate the effect of pile thickness the results in fig 9 show that 1 increasing the pile thickness from h 0 01 a to h 0 02 a will reduce both displacement and rotation at the top ending of pile to a large extent fig 9a and b but further increase in thickness will have much smaller benefit 2 the shape of the distributed lateral force is similar to the shape of the lateral displacement while the shape of the distributed moment is similar to the shape of the rotation fig 9a d 3 the distributed lateral force is not sensitive to the wall thickness when h 0 02 a fig 9c 4 increasing the thickness will decrease the distributed lateral force and moment along the pile in general fig 9c and d 5 increasing thickness will decrease the maximal shear force in the pile and the location of the maximum point will move downward fig 9e 6 increasing thickness will increase the moment along the pile fig 9f 5 2 4 influence of soil s elastic modulus five values of soil s elastic modulus are chosen to study the influence of soil modulus from very soft clay to stiff clay e s 10 mpa e s 40 mpa e s 80 mpa e s 160 mpa and e s 320 mpa the results are illustrated in fig 10 in non dimensional form it can be found in fig 10 that 1 all the deformation curves pass through the same two points z 0 15 l and z 0 75 l in all the 5 soil cases fig 10a in order to see whether this mechanism exists in other cases three more cases are added monopile with the same aspect ratio l a 10 but a different load eccentricity ratio e h a 20 and monopile with two different aspect ratios l a 6 and l a 16 the results in fig 10b 10 d indicate that the phenomenon s present for all the semi rigid monopiles however the locations of the two points are not fixed the locations move upward with the increase of pile aspect ratio for a monopile with a fixed aspect ratio the change of soil modulus or load eccentricity will not change the locations 2 both the non dimensional displacement and rotation at the top ending of pile increase with the decrease of pile soil modulus ratio fig 10a e 3 distributed lateral forces become larger at the location above the lower rotation point and become smaller below the lower rotation point when the clay becomes harder fig 10f 4 distributed moments along the pile become larger in the upper part and smaller in the lower part when the clay becomes harder fig 10g 5 the maximal shear force in the pile will increase and the location of the maximum point will move upward with the increase of clay s elastic modulus fig 10h 6 the moment along the pile will drop with the increase of clay s elastic modulus fig 10i 5 2 5 influence of loading frequency loading frequency is important for monopile s responses as offshore monopiles are subjected to loads with different frequencies such as winds waves operating forces and earthquake loadings in order to study the influence of loading frequencies 5 different frequencies are chosen f 0 01 hz f 0 3 hz f 1 hz and f 5 hz these correspond respectively to quasi static load or the frequency of wind frequency of wave or the first resonant frequency of wind turbine the second resonant frequency of wind turbine and a typical earthquake loading frequency the corresponding non dimensional amplitude of the results are illustrated in fig 11 from which the following observations can be made 1 the results for f 0 01 hz f 0 3 hz and f 1 hz are very close for all the responses and the results in theses frequencies can be treated as quasi static responses 2 the results for f 5 hz are quite different namely the lateral displacement rotation distributed lateral force distributed moment and shear force at the lower part of the pile become larger to the quasi static case the largest shear force shows an increase of 15 compared to the quasi static case and the location for the largest shear force point moves downward 3 the moment along the whole pile at f 5 hz is larger than that at quasi static case 5 3 comparison with the model without base the effect of the base can be considered using the proposed model in this study however compared to the no base effect model in he et al 2019a inclusion of the base effect requires a more complex model and more computer times moreover the accurate values of base shear and base moment for monopiles are very difficult to obtain in field or model tests therefore the question is if it is possible to ignore the base effect i e ignore base shear and base moment to answer this question the pile responses and dynamic impedances obtained using the with base effect model here are compared with the no base effect model in he et al 2019a in the following sections 5 3 1 pile responses the pile responses obtained from the two models i e with and without base are illustrated in fig 12 from which one can conclude the following 1 the lateral displacements and rotations obtained in the two models are practically identical fig 12a and b especially in the larger aspect ratio case l a 10 2 the shear forces and moments along the pile are also very close in the two models except at the pile tip where the shear force and moment are zero in the no base effect case while they are non zero in the with base effect case fig 12c and d 3 the reason that the responses are almost equal in the two models are the bottom stresses in the with base effect model are transferred to the pile shaft in the no base effect model the pile soil is in a state of high order statically indeterminate system the result shows that the pile s responses are not sensitive to the detailed stress distributions around the pile tip the stress transfer from the base to the shaft mechanism will make the distributed lateral force and moment at the shaft near the base become much larger in the no base case as shown in fig 12e and f 5 3 2 dynamic impedances the comparison of dynamic impedances in the two cases with and without effect of base are illustrated in fig 13 there are two kinds of impedances introduced one is obtained by applying a unit force at the pile head

impedance terms in the two cases are almost identical and that consideration of the base has practically no effect on the results through the comparisons of the pile responses and impedances in the two models it can be found that the influence of the base is localized to the pile shaft near the base and it will not change the pile head displacement pile head rotation the largest shear force the largest moment along the pile and the dynamic impedances this phenomenon is caused by the stress transfer from the base to the shaft mechanism 6 conclusions a semi analytical model which can obtain the base shear base moment base displacement and base rotation simultaneously is proposed pile responses including pile displacement rotation distributed lateral force distributed moment shear force and moment along the pile are obtained using the proposed model the influences of the pile length load eccentricity pile thickness soil modulus and loading frequency are analyzed in detail using this model besides a comparison with the no base effect model is also conducted in this paper and the following conclusions can be made 1 the base shear force is noteworthy in the monopile with a small aspect ratio e g l a 10 and getting unapparent in the pile with larger aspect ratios 2 the bottom moment is insignificant even in the monopile with a very low aspect ratio l a 6 3 the effect of loading frequency on the pile responses is not important when the frequency is small e g f 1 hz or ω 0 15 and the pile s responses can be treated as quasi static on the other hand the dynamic responses should be considered when the loading frequency is higher 4 the effect of bottom shear and bottom moment is limited to the pile shaft close to the bottom and has almost negligible influence on the overall responses of the monopile this is caused by the mechanism that the bottom stresses will transfer to the pile shaft if there s no explicit bottom considered and the overall responses of the pile are not sensitive to the redistribution of the stresses note that all the results are obtained within the small strain and pile soil in full contact hypotheses the results can only be used when the soil is not strongly non linear that is the wind turbines are in normal operation conditions and whether these results are suitable for other cases needs further researches credit authorship

20863,the surface morphology of the ballast tank has changed due to years of exposure to seawater corrosion hence the severity of pitting corrosion and the random shapes of corrosion pits may affect the remaining life of the ballast tank therefore this paper presents the difference in surface morphologies of corroded ballast tank and its correlation to the geometry of corrosion pits these morphologies are related to the corrosion pit depth which is obtained with a 3d laser scan furthermore pit depth distributions are analyzed with some statistical parameters at different volumetric changes as a result the difference in pitting severity on several volumetric changes is associated with the corrosion pit geometry the larger volumetric changes the lower pitting severity and thus the corrosion pits become a less sharp form or shallower corrosion pits keywords pit depth distribution statistical analysis surface morphology pitting severity pit geometry 1 introduction according to iacs 2020 ships are designed to be able to withstand operation in a seawater environment for 25 30 years bhandari et al 2015 and baere et al 2013a stated that corrosion is a major cause of marine structural failures particularly the ballast tank which prone to seawater see also baere et al 2013b two common forms of corrosion that correspond to seawater corrosion are uniform and pitting corrosion pitting corrosion produces small holes with random shapes and dimensions these shapes comprise narrow deep hemi spherical shallow wide undercutting sub surface horizontal vertical etc see huang and zhang 2018 frankel 1998 found that the tendency of pitting severity varies with the logarithm of the bulk chloride concentration thus pitting corrosion inside ballast tanks is uneven and sometimes localized furthermore the corrosion pit shapes and the volumetric change inside of the ballast tank may affect the remaining life of the plates and reduce the strength of the ballast tank unpredictably thereby the remaining life assessment should be able to consider different surface morphologies therefore this paper focuses on the different surface morphologies on corroded ballast tank and its correlation to the severity of pitting corrosion and corrosion pit geometry at a number of volumetric changes 3d laser scan has been used to provide surface morphology data of corroded specimens for the statistical analysis for example by wei et al 2016 nie et al 2019 kashani et al 2013 li et al 2018 and zhao and fu 2018 wei et al 2016 utilized the 3d laser scan to examine the geometric parameter of the corroded steel bar similarly it is stated in nie et al 2019 that the surface profile of the corroded steel plate and corrosion pit depth data are obtained from the measurement by 3d non contact surface topography instrument this pit depth can grow because of the passive layer dissolution without further re passivation see izquierdo et al 2015 additionally the application of a cross sectional area obtained from a 3d laser scan is to calculate the average weight loss ratio see li et al 2018 and zhao and fu 2018 thus the corrosion degree is defined by the weight loss of corroded specimens i e the ratio of the difference in initial and final weight to the initial weight further kolios et al 2014 identified the severity of pitting corrosion with a number of pits and total pitted volume however if only weight loss or volumetric change is considered then it is neither accurate nor precise to predict the pitting severity level because of the irregularity of corrosion pits on the corroded surface moreover the correlation between corrosion volumetric change and corrosion pit depth is required with regards to the structural performance accordingly in the literature review zerbst et al 2019 concluded that defects as the root cause of fatigue failure of metallic components such as cavities dents corrosion pits and scratch the interference of corrosion pits affects the probability failure of the reinforced concrete beams as stated by kioumarsi et al 2016 further valor et al 2014 used a corrosion defect sized distribution as input for estimation of the failure pipeline system moreover the pit hole size and pitting corrosion parameters have a significant effect on long service operation which was reflected in ahammed and melcher 1995 it is known that corrosion pit size correlates with the pitting factor which according to yu et al 2015 the pitting factor is between 2 and 5 5 for a steel bar this value corresponds to the finding of morales et al 2019 which confirmed that a pitting factor that larger than one significantly reduces the service life of prestressed tendons additionally as a corrosion degree wei et al 2016 confirmed a good agreement between the pitting factor and the mass loss rate similarly zhao and fu 2018 proposed a pitting factor to observe the tendency of corrosion pit when the corrosion becomes severe the pitting factor is the ratio between maximum corrosion pit depth and the average corrosion pit depth thereby the pitting factor is a useful parameter to assess the corrosion pit size and pitting severity nevertheless corrosion pit is time dependent thus the severity of pitting corrosion as well as corrosion pit geometry change according to the function of time with unpredictable severity of pitting corrosion and final shapes regarding time dependent characteristics of corrosion paik et al 2004 developed a mathematical model to predict wastage of corrosion in seawater ballast tank as a function of time concerning the ballasting process wang et al 2017 concluded that the pit growth dynamic is significantly affected by solution chemistry ph and the flow rate accordingly with regards to the prediction model of pitting corrosion li et al 2019 developed a model considering pit initiation and pit growth similarly a time dependent random function for corrosion growth is developed by akpan et al 2002 to investigate the reliability of the hull structure furthermore related to the strength parameter nie et al 2019 found that with the increase of corrosion time the yield strength ultimate strength and elongation decrease on a corroded steel beam additionally zhang et al 2017 carried out an experimental for ultimate strength to validate the assumption of corrosion damage in finite element analysis see rahbar ranji 2012 and assessment method of corroded plates considering corroded volume loss see huang et al 2010 likewise it is stated in wang et al 2019 that the risk of pipe fracture increase with the increases of corrosion pit depth nonetheless corrosion pit is not only associated with the time dependent but also with uneven and localized pitting corrosion characteristics inside the ballast tank hence the difference in surface morphologies in a specific time interval and how the random spread of pitting corrosion affects the pitting severity and its geometry in the ballast tank remains a question therefore the aim of research in the present work is to investigate the different surface morphologies of corroded ballast tanks and their correlation to the geometry of corrosion pits the surface morphology data is obtained with a 3d laser scanner that measures the coordinates of the surface of the corroded specimen these coordinates are tabulated to acquire the corrosion pit depth distribution and volumetric change δvr the corrosion pit depth is analyzed using statistical parameters based on matlab calculation that considers aspects of volumetric change to assess the morphological differences on the surface of the corroded specimens therefore the probability density function and cumulative distribution function are used to elucidate the corrosion pit characteristics and the likelihood of the pit depth distribution at a specific volumetric change ratio additionally three distributions i e lognormal gaussian and weibull are considered on the probability analysis furthermore the goodness fit test statistics are carried out to investigate the propensity of pit depth to a particular distribution which is supported by the visual of the probability plot the use of skewness and kurtosis on probability density function and pitting factor are to assess the irregularity distribution of pit depth due to the presence of pits and pitting severity on the corroded surface these irregularities and severity are used to analyze the corrosion pit geometry in several volumetric changes 2 specimen experiments the 3d laser scan and statistical analysis are used to investigate the difference in surface morphology of corroded ballast tanks 14 dog bone corroded specimens were scanned with a 3d laser to obtain the data on surface morphology these data are tabulated to acquire volumetric change and distribution of corrosion pit depth for each specimen furthermore the pit depth distribution is analyzed with probability density function pdf cumulative distribution function cdf probability plot p p plot and quantile plot q q plot as shown in fig 1 the outputs are used to elaborate the corrosion pit geometry at a number of volumetric changes 2 1 materials the material in this study was originated from bulk carrier natalie bolten built in 1974 and the ship was rebuilt to be a pipelayer called lorelay in 1986 furthermore the steel was taken from the transverse floor plates of the ballast tank the floors were a panel with 1900 mm high and 930 mm wide and a manhole of about 900 mm high and 440 mm wide the initial floor thickness was 11 mm and was assumed as a standard shipbuilding steel see neumann 2018 additionally baere et al 2011 stated that ordinary grade a is utilized on the ship ballast tank construction refer to astm a131 a131m 08 standard specifications for structural steel for ships similarly the material grade is also on the normal strength steel vl a on dnv gl classification rules see dnv gl 2015 the properties of the material of steel grade a is explained in table 1 2 2 the 3d laser scan process the dimension of the dog bone specimen is described in fig 2 further the acid cleaning process was conducted to remove the corrosion product of the corroded specimen as shown in fig 3 hence the astm g1 90 standard practice for preparing cleaning and evaluating corrosion test specimens was used as a reference on the process furthermore the 3d laser scanning technology was utilized to obtain an accurate surface morphology model of the corroded specimen as shown in fig 4 this is because a 3d laser scan has high resolution and provides preliminary data for advanced analysis 3d laser scanning technology avoids the shortcomings of conventional methods of measuring the depth of corrosion the laser scanner is a micro epsilon scan control llt2800 25 it was mounted on a screw slider driven by a small electric motor controlled by a systec xemo system model r362 g moreover the specimens were placed on one side so that the 3d scan process was conducted on the longitudinal direction the larger area close to the end side of the specimen was not scanned first the laser was started with movement along with the corroded specimen after one side of the specimen has been scanned it was rotated and reversed and the scan rerun a 90 overlap was considered between each scan to merge the generated point cloud the results of points cloud based on 3d scanning are presented in fig 5 2 3 statistical methods the characteristics of pit depth distribution on the corroded specimen are elaborated by using probability density function and cumulative distribution function based on matlab calculation additionally on the probability analysis three distributions are considered i e gaussian lognormal and weibull distribution furthermore the propensity of corrosion pit depth to a specific distribution is assessed by goodness fittest i e chi square and p value moreover the kurtosis and skewness on probability density function are used to assess corrosion pits irregularity and severity of pitting corrosion of corroded specimens thereby the equation for probability density function the cumulative distribution function of normal lognormal and weibull are defined as follows eq 1 f x 1 2 π σ exp 1 2 1 μ σ 2 f o r x r eq 2 f x 1 2 π σ x exp 1 2 t μ σ 2 d t f o r x r the standard normal distribution is in the case of μ 0 and σ 1 lognormal distribution considers a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed eq 3 f x 1 2 π x σ exp 1 2 l o f x μ σ 2 f o r x 0 eq 4 f x 1 2 π x σ 0 x 1 2 exp 1 2 log t μ σ 2 d t f o r x 0 the equation for probability density function and cumulative distribution function for weibull is written as follows respectively eq 5 f x λ σ x σ λ 1 exp x σ λ 0 x 0 λ eq 6 f x 0 x λ σ λ t λ 1 exp t σ λ d t 1 exp x σ λ where μ is the location parameter and σ is the scale parameter and λ is the shape parameter p p plot and q q plot are used to evaluate the distributions with more magnification in the center and tails of distributions respectively the visual results of the probability plot and the description of the quantiles plot are used to support the statistical results of goodness fittest and the calculated skewness respectively p p plot compares data from different distributions i e the empirical cdf and theoretical cdf of a data set visually meanwhile and q q plot compares the quantiles of data distribution with the quantiles of standardized theoretical distributions the appearance of empirical data and theoretical distribution is represented with the marker symbol and the reference line this line connects the first and third quartile and extends to the ends of the data the quantiles plot is constructed by inverse the cumulative distribution function the abscissa is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function and the ordinate is the x data value depends on the type of distribution the point of quantiles q on random variable x follows equations eq 7 p x q f x q p where fx is the cumulative distribution function of x the quantile function is obtained with the inverse of the cumulative distribution function eq 8 q f x 1 p 3 results 3 1 volumetric change ratio and corrosion pit depth distribution volumetric change ratio δvr is considered as a parameter describing the degree of corrosion the volumetric change ratio is acquired by calculating the initial volume of the specimen and final corroded volume condition the equation of volumetric change ratio is explained as follows eq 9 υ r v i v f v i a i l 1 n a f l a i l the initial specimen v i is acquired by multiplying the cross sectional area to the length of the specimen on the corroded one the specimen is divided into a number of cross sectional areas with a specific length between these areas the v f is obtained by the accumulation of multiplying length to numbers of cross sectional areas thereby the interval of the volumetric change ratio δvr for 14 corroded specimens is 14 84 28 29 as shown in fig 6 a a comparative analysis is conducted to see the correlation between corrosion pit depth along the axial direction and numerous volumetric change ratios δvr an irregularity is shown on the corrosion pit depth distribution along the length of 14 corroded specimens moreover each of the corroded specimens has no significant difference in a fluctuation of corrosion depth from the others which also represents the thickness thereby the irregularity along the length of the corroded specimen is relatively homogeneous with different thicknesses as a function of corrosion time exposure three volumetric change ratios are considered in the investigation of the characteristics of corrosion pit depth along with the corroded specimen i e 14 84 19 49 and 28 29 which represent the lowest medium and the largest volumetric change as shown in fig 6b this difference in volume explains the tendency of random surface irregularities at different volumetric changes accordingly surface irregularities among the δvr equal to 14 84 19 49 and 28 29 are different from each other these random patterns of irregularity valid for all 14 corroded specimens 3 2 corrosion pit depth distribution analysis on δvr 14 84 on the probability density function the average corrosion depth and maximum corrosion pit depth are represented by a peak in the middle and bottom of the tails as shown in fig 7 a the average corrosion depth and the maximum corrosion pit depth are respectively 1 633 mm and 2 344 mm further on the goodness fit test statistic a critical value equal to 26 125 and level of significance equivalent to 0 001 are respectively used as a limit on the calculation of chi square and p value the gaussian distribution has 6 659 of chi square value and a p value equal to 0 5738 the chi square and p value of the lognormal distribution are respectively 15 073 and 0 058 furthermore weibull distribution has a chi square value equal to 15 867 and 0 044 p value additionally the empirical data for the cumulative distribution function of corrosion pit depth has a similar pattern in terms of the slope and both tails on three distributions i e gaussian lognormal and weibull distribution as shown in fig 7b the short tails indicate small numbers of corrosion pit depth which close to minimum and maximum corrosion pit depth fig 7c shows that on the probability plot the empirical data appears along with the theoretical distribution which is represented with the reference line this line connects the first and third quartile and extends to the ends of the data additionally the empirical data is obtained from the observation during the experimental of 3d laser scans on corroded specimens i e corrosion pit depth meanwhile the theoretical distribution refers to the ideal of specific distribution e g gaussian lognormal and weibull distributions furthermore with regards to the cumulative distribution function on three distributions the theoretical and empirical corrosion pit depth distributions are fitted in the center additionally the use of the quantile plot is to describe the skewness i e the degree of asymmetry of the probability distribution from the mean value following the linearity between empirical data and the reference line on the quantile plot a tendency of left skewed or negative skewness is shown in fig 7d especially on the lognormal and weibull distribution this is in line with quantitative skewness value x i μ σ 0 963 3 3 corrosion pit depth distribution analysis on δvr 19 49 on the larger volumetric change ratio δvr i e 19 49 the probability density function pdf of corrosion pit depth is characterized by a peak in middle right and skewness to the left as shown in fig 8 a the average corrosion depth and maximum corrosion pit depth is 2 144 mm 2 832 mm respectively furthermore on the goodness fittest the pit depth distribution conforms more to weibull distribution this is indicated with the value of chi square equal to 13 921 which less than the critical value that is 26 125 the p value of 0 0839 is higher than the significance level 0 001 additionally the gaussian and lognormal distribution are off due to the chi square value is larger than the critical and the p value close to zero the cumulative distribution function with the volumetric change ratio δvr equal to 19 49 has a resemblance of distribution with a volumetric change ratio of 14 84 the difference is on the slope and tails small numbers of pit depths that close to its minimum value are indicated on a slightly longer tail on bottom left as shown in fig 8b meanwhile a large amount of corrosion pit depth is signified with a cut off line on the top right further on the probability plot with the volumetric change ratio δvr equal to 19 49 the empirical and theoretical distributions are more fitted to weibull distribution as shown in fig 8c additionally on the quantiles plot of weibull distribution the empirical plot data against the reference line shows a left skewed or negative skewness as shown in fig 8d it is indicated with most of the data on the right side with a long tail extending out to the left the skewness value 0 1829 is less negative than the skewness value at the volumetric change ratio δvr equal to 14 84 which is 0 963 3 4 corrosion pit depth distribution analysis on δvr 28 29 a peak in the middle and lower tails on both sides is found on the probability density function with the largest volumetric change ratio i e 28 29 see fig 9 a the average corrosion depth and maximum pit depth are equal to 3 111 mm and 3 721 mm respectively the distribution of corrosion pit depth is corresponded to gaussian distribution because of the chi square and p value results which respectively equal to 24 367 and 0 002 further the weibull and lognormal distributions are off due to a larger chi square value than the critical value and a p value close to zero on several volumetric change ratios the cumulative distribution function of all distributions has a cut offline i e short on both tails as shown in fig 9b the maximum and minimum pit depth is noted with these short tails which is also shown on the δvr 14 84 furthermore on the probability plot the empirical data for gaussian distribution are fitted to theoretical distribution on the reference line as shown in fig 9c the slope difference in both empirical and theoretical distribution on several volumetric change ratios describes the dispersion of data that is over dispersed data in fig 9d negative skewness or left skewed is described on the quantile plots on the volumetric change ratio δvr equal to 28 29 the calculated skewness has a larger negative value 0 488 compared to δvr 14 84 with 0 963 4 discussion on 14 corroded specimens the irregularity of corrosion pit depth distribution appears randomly with decreasing thickness and increasing volumetric change ratio δvr similar conditions occur for all 14 specimens it is due to the continuous corrosion time exposure during the ballasting and de ballasting process especially localized corrosion mechanisms in terms of pitting corrosion and microbial induced corrosion see heyer et al 2013 the probability density function is used to explain the likelihood of the pit depth distribution at a specific volumetric change ratio δvr additionally the corrosion stages on the corroded specimen can be explained with skewness and kurtosis on the probability density function see to et al 2018 goodness fit test statistics are carried out to investigate the propensity of pit depth to a particular distribution in the volumetric change ratio δvr 14 84 the pit depth distribution is more corresponds to the gaussian distribution this is related to the smallest chi square value and the largest p value respectively compared to the critical value and the value of a significant level as shown in table 2 on the volumetric change ratio δvr equal to 14 84 and 19 49 the pit distribution tendency is more conform to weibull and gaussian further seven specimens corresponded to gaussian six specimens belong to weibull and one specimen suit to lognormal distribution the correlation between corrosion pit depth distribution and these probability models is on the randomness of the corroded ballast tank s surface morphology i e gaussian and non gaussian the corrosion pit depth distribution is affected by the cumulative corrosion process i e microbiological induced corrosion and pitting corrosion accordingly it accumulates random discrete specific occasions and disregarding the governed local occasion distribution generates a cumulative effect governed by gaussian form see bhushan 2001 additionally single or extreme value processes are considered as non gaussian surfaces a resemble pattern on three distributions i e the gaussian weibull and lognormal is shown on the cumulative distribution function with three different volumetric change ratios δvr i e 14 84 19 49 and 28 29 furthermore the difference lies in the slope and the tails i e bottom left and top right the slopes tend to shallower with a greater volumetric change ratio this is related to the lower kurtosis which is a stable corrosion pit on the δvr 14 84 the tails on the top right and bottom left are relatively homogenous in length which is indicated with a small amount of minimum and maximum pit depth additionally few numbers of small pit depths are indicated with a slightly longer tail on the bottom left as shown on δvr 19 49 the use of probability plot and quantiles are to observe the lack of fit in the distribution at center and tail the graphical probability plot is used to assess whether the empirical data sets pursue to a particular distribution i e gaussian lognormal and weibull distribution the cumulative distribution function data is used to transform the data sets into a linear plot the comparison of observed empirical data to the theoretical data is at the center of probability plots therefore probability plots are suitable to compare the area with high probability density it is due to more rapid alteration of empirical and theoretical of cdf on this area compared to the area with low probability density on the probability plot of δvr 14 84 the gaussian distribution is more suitable compared to lognormal and weibull distribution this is indicated by more empirical data that is close to the reference line on the center of distribution the peak density of normal distribution is signified with a higher density in the middle right meanwhile weibull distribution and gaussian distribution is more corresponded to δvr equal to 19 49 and 28 29 respectively this correspondence is in line with the results of goodness fit test statistics considering different corrosion time exposure to et al 2018 have been able to link skewness negativity and severity of pitting corrosion whereas the surface morphology data obtained from 3d laser scans in this paper were taken at a certain time period therefore differences in volumetric changes due to uneven pitting corrosion are considered an independent parameter of skewness skewness and kurtosis are essential to describe the surface asymmetry and flatness see bhushan 2001 the skewness is calculated and its description can be seen on the quantiles plot of specific volumetric changes δvr at the δvr of 14 84 the irregularity due to the presence of pits is shown by negative skewness which is 0 963 further a decrease of pitting severity is indicated by the reduction of skewness negativity on the δvr equal to 19 49 with a value of 0 1829 moreover a less negative skewness value of 0 4879 is demonstrated on δvr equal to 28 29 the reduced negativity of skewness on a number of volumetric changes indicates that the severity of pitting corrosion is reduced as shown in fig 10 the linear regression of kurtosis shows a value higher than 3 indicating that pits cause a peak on corroded specimens additionally fig 10 shows a negative slope of kurtosis indicates the flat distribution with low kurtosis i e pit become stable thereby surface morphology is more homogeneous with increasing volumetric change ratio i e the severity of pitting corrosion decreases furthermore the lower pitting severity indicates a stable corrosion pit or uniform thus the greater the volumetric change the less sharp the corrosion pit fig 11 shows the correlation between the pitting factor pf at several volumetric changes in the longitudinal direction of the corroded specimen an indicator of the pitting severity of the corroded surface is the value of the pitting factor that is equal to 1 and larger than 1 see zhao and fu 2018 if pf is equal to 1 the specimen has a uniform corroded surface morphology in this case along with the longitudinal directions an increase of pitting severity is indicated by pitting factor value which larger than 1 the greater the pitting factor the more severe corrosion pits corrosion additionally the tendency of pitting factor fluctuations in longitudinal directions decreases with the increase of volumetric changes furthermore the linear regression line shows a negative slope of the pitting factor to volumetric changes δvr thus showing a tendency for surface morphology to be uniform considering the reduced severity of corrosion at larger volumetric changes and thus the corrosion pits tend to have a shallower pit or less sharp form further the findings of jakubowski 2014 stated that corrosion pit often has a conical shape and the uneven and localized characteristics of pitting corrosion thereby other possible shapes of corrosion pit of the corroded specimen with smaller volumetric changes are narrow deep and hemi spherical which also forms before ending in a shallow wide form as shown in fig 12 these corrosion pits form can be considered on corrosion pit modeling and growth the pit geometry considers faraday s law with the assumption of the constant volumetric growth rate of the pit until a critical depth the pit growth with at a constant volumetric rate dv dt follows the law of electrochemistry considering metal dissolution with the equation as follows see harlow and wei 1998 2009 and rajasankar and iyer 2006 eq 10 d v d t m i p n f p where m is the molecular weight of the material n is the valence f is faraday s constant equal to 96514 cmol 1 is the faraday constant ρ is density and i p is the pitting current considering temperature the mathematical equation of i p with an assumption of arrhenius law written as follows eq 11 i p i p o exp h r t where δh is the activation enthalpy r is 8 314 j mol k 1 for gas constant and t is temperature equation 11 is combined with equation 10 eq 12 d v d t m i p o n f ρ exp h r t the corrosion pit is considered to have a spherical form with volume eq 13 v 2 3 π 2 c a 2 where a and 2c are the major and minor axes respectively and to simplify the equation 2c is written as c the rate of volume alteration is written as follows eq 14 d v d t 2 3 π d c d t a 2 2 a c d a d t equations 12 and 14 are combined eq 15 2 3 π d c d t a 2 2 a c d a d t m i p o n f ρ exp h r t considering the aspect ratio rp equal to a c corrosion pit with a c equal 1 indicates that the pit has a hemispherical shape the shallow wide with has a c and a c signify the narrow deep the equation 15 is re written as eq 16 2 π r p 2 c 2 d c d t m i p o n f ρ exp h rt hence the volume is written as eq 17 v 2 3 π r p 2 c 3 the rate of volume of corrosion pit with the initial ci and final pit radius cf yields the equation as follows eq 18 2 3 π r p 2 c f 3 c i 3 m i p o n f ρ exp h rt t the eq 19 explains the total requires to pit the growth and size of the pit from the initial condition into the final condition in terms of critical pit size accordingly it is considered on the critical pit to crack transition see harlow and wei 1998 the adjustment of equation 18 is written as follows eq 19 t f 2 3 π r p 2 n f ρ m i p o exp h rt c f 3 c i 3 eq 20 c c i 3 3 2 m i p o n f ρ t π r ρ 2 exp h rt 5 conclusion this paper investigates the correlation between the difference in surface morphologies and corrosion pit geometry on the surface of the corroded ballast tank the corrosion pit depth distribution is analyzed with several statistical parameters such as probability distribution cumulative distribution function skewness and kurtosis probability plot and quantile plot additionally a number of volumetric change ratios are considered to differentiate a surface morphology from the others i e 14 84 19 49 and 28 29 furthermore irregularity of pit depth due to corrosion pits the tendency of corrosion pit depth to a specific distribution severity of pitting corrosion on the surface of the corroded specimen as well as corrosion pit geometry at a number of volumetric changes are elaborated on the present study the results are outlined as follows the irregularity of corrosion pit depth appears randomly with decreasing thickness of the corroded specimen and increasing volumetric change ratio δvr this is influenced by localized corrosion i e combination microbiological induced corrosion and pitting corrosion of seawater the peak the slope and both tails on respectively probability density function and cumulative distribution functions are effective in explaining the characteristics of corrosion pit depth distribution i e maximum and minimum pit depth and average pit depth the chi square test and p value on the goodness fittest of shows that seven specimens follow gaussian distribution five specimens suitable for weibull distribution and one fit to lognormal additionally the visual of a probability plot effectively supports the results of goodness fit tests to investigate trends to a particular distribution these distributions are related to the topography of randomness of surface roughness which consists of isotropic or anisotropic and gaussian or non gaussian the reduced negativity of skewness which is also described on quantile plots and a small negative slope on linear regression of kurtosis on a number of volumetric changes indicates the severity of pitting corrosion decreases this also signifies that the greater the volumetric change the less sharp the corrosion pit the pitting factor tends to decrease with the increase of volumetric changes indicate a tendency for surface morphology to be uniform and stable corrosion pit in other words the shallow wide form of corrosion pit is more likely on the larger volumetric change ratio nevertheless more specimens are needed for further research because this paper elaborated on 14

20863,the surface morphology of the ballast tank has changed due to years of exposure to seawater corrosion hence the severity of pitting corrosion and the random shapes of corrosion pits may affect the remaining life of the ballast tank therefore this paper presents the difference in surface morphologies of corroded ballast tank and its correlation to the geometry of corrosion pits these morphologies are related to the corrosion pit depth which is obtained with a 3d laser scan furthermore pit depth distributions are analyzed with some statistical parameters at different volumetric changes as a result the difference in pitting severity on several volumetric changes is associated with the corrosion pit geometry the larger volumetric changes the lower pitting severity and thus the corrosion pits become a less sharp form or shallower corrosion pits keywords pit depth distribution statistical analysis surface morphology pitting severity pit geometry 1 introduction according to iacs 2020 ships are designed to be able to withstand operation in a seawater environment for 25 30 years bhandari et al 2015 and baere et al 2013a stated that corrosion is a major cause of marine structural failures particularly the ballast tank which prone to seawater see also baere et al 2013b two common forms of corrosion that correspond to seawater corrosion are uniform and pitting corrosion pitting corrosion produces small holes with random shapes and dimensions these shapes comprise narrow deep hemi spherical shallow wide undercutting sub surface horizontal vertical etc see huang and zhang 2018 frankel 1998 found that the tendency of pitting severity varies with the logarithm of the bulk chloride concentration thus pitting corrosion inside ballast tanks is uneven and sometimes localized furthermore the corrosion pit shapes and the volumetric change inside of the ballast tank may affect the remaining life of the plates and reduce the strength of the ballast tank unpredictably thereby the remaining life assessment should be able to consider different surface morphologies therefore this paper focuses on the different surface morphologies on corroded ballast tank and its correlation to the severity of pitting corrosion and corrosion pit geometry at a number of volumetric changes 3d laser scan has been used to provide surface morphology data of corroded specimens for the statistical analysis for example by wei et al 2016 nie et al 2019 kashani et al 2013 li et al 2018 and zhao and fu 2018 wei et al 2016 utilized the 3d laser scan to examine the geometric parameter of the corroded steel bar similarly it is stated in nie et al 2019 that the surface profile of the corroded steel plate and corrosion pit depth data are obtained from the measurement by 3d non contact surface topography instrument this pit depth can grow because of the passive layer dissolution without further re passivation see izquierdo et al 2015 additionally the application of a cross sectional area obtained from a 3d laser scan is to calculate the average weight loss ratio see li et al 2018 and zhao and fu 2018 thus the corrosion degree is defined by the weight loss of corroded specimens i e the ratio of the difference in initial and final weight to the initial weight further kolios et al 2014 identified the severity of pitting corrosion with a number of pits and total pitted volume however if only weight loss or volumetric change is considered then it is neither accurate nor precise to predict the pitting severity level because of the irregularity of corrosion pits on the corroded surface moreover the correlation between corrosion volumetric change and corrosion pit depth is required with regards to the structural performance accordingly in the literature review zerbst et al 2019 concluded that defects as the root cause of fatigue failure of metallic components such as cavities dents corrosion pits and scratch the interference of corrosion pits affects the probability failure of the reinforced concrete beams as stated by kioumarsi et al 2016 further valor et al 2014 used a corrosion defect sized distribution as input for estimation of the failure pipeline system moreover the pit hole size and pitting corrosion parameters have a significant effect on long service operation which was reflected in ahammed and melcher 1995 it is known that corrosion pit size correlates with the pitting factor which according to yu et al 2015 the pitting factor is between 2 and 5 5 for a steel bar this value corresponds to the finding of morales et al 2019 which confirmed that a pitting factor that larger than one significantly reduces the service life of prestressed tendons additionally as a corrosion degree wei et al 2016 confirmed a good agreement between the pitting factor and the mass loss rate similarly zhao and fu 2018 proposed a pitting factor to observe the tendency of corrosion pit when the corrosion becomes severe the pitting factor is the ratio between maximum corrosion pit depth and the average corrosion pit depth thereby the pitting factor is a useful parameter to assess the corrosion pit size and pitting severity nevertheless corrosion pit is time dependent thus the severity of pitting corrosion as well as corrosion pit geometry change according to the function of time with unpredictable severity of pitting corrosion and final shapes regarding time dependent characteristics of corrosion paik et al 2004 developed a mathematical model to predict wastage of corrosion in seawater ballast tank as a function of time concerning the ballasting process wang et al 2017 concluded that the pit growth dynamic is significantly affected by solution chemistry ph and the flow rate accordingly with regards to the prediction model of pitting corrosion li et al 2019 developed a model considering pit initiation and pit growth similarly a time dependent random function for corrosion growth is developed by akpan et al 2002 to investigate the reliability of the hull structure furthermore related to the strength parameter nie et al 2019 found that with the increase of corrosion time the yield strength ultimate strength and elongation decrease on a corroded steel beam additionally zhang et al 2017 carried out an experimental for ultimate strength to validate the assumption of corrosion damage in finite element analysis see rahbar ranji 2012 and assessment method of corroded plates considering corroded volume loss see huang et al 2010 likewise it is stated in wang et al 2019 that the risk of pipe fracture increase with the increases of corrosion pit depth nonetheless corrosion pit is not only associated with the time dependent but also with uneven and localized pitting corrosion characteristics inside the ballast tank hence the difference in surface morphologies in a specific time interval and how the random spread of pitting corrosion affects the pitting severity and its geometry in the ballast tank remains a question therefore the aim of research in the present work is to investigate the different surface morphologies of corroded ballast tanks and their correlation to the geometry of corrosion pits the surface morphology data is obtained with a 3d laser scanner that measures the coordinates of the surface of the corroded specimen these coordinates are tabulated to acquire the corrosion pit depth distribution and volumetric change δvr the corrosion pit depth is analyzed using statistical parameters based on matlab calculation that considers aspects of volumetric change to assess the morphological differences on the surface of the corroded specimens therefore the probability density function and cumulative distribution function are used to elucidate the corrosion pit characteristics and the likelihood of the pit depth distribution at a specific volumetric change ratio additionally three distributions i e lognormal gaussian and weibull are considered on the probability analysis furthermore the goodness fit test statistics are carried out to investigate the propensity of pit depth to a particular distribution which is supported by the visual of the probability plot the use of skewness and kurtosis on probability density function and pitting factor are to assess the irregularity distribution of pit depth due to the presence of pits and pitting severity on the corroded surface these irregularities and severity are used to analyze the corrosion pit geometry in several volumetric changes 2 specimen experiments the 3d laser scan and statistical analysis are used to investigate the difference in surface morphology of corroded ballast tanks 14 dog bone corroded specimens were scanned with a 3d laser to obtain the data on surface morphology these data are tabulated to acquire volumetric change and distribution of corrosion pit depth for each specimen furthermore the pit depth distribution is analyzed with probability density function pdf cumulative distribution function cdf probability plot p p plot and quantile plot q q plot as shown in fig 1 the outputs are used to elaborate the corrosion pit geometry at a number of volumetric changes 2 1 materials the material in this study was originated from bulk carrier natalie bolten built in 1974 and the ship was rebuilt to be a pipelayer called lorelay in 1986 furthermore the steel was taken from the transverse floor plates of the ballast tank the floors were a panel with 1900 mm high and 930 mm wide and a manhole of about 900 mm high and 440 mm wide the initial floor thickness was 11 mm and was assumed as a standard shipbuilding steel see neumann 2018 additionally baere et al 2011 stated that ordinary grade a is utilized on the ship ballast tank construction refer to astm a131 a131m 08 standard specifications for structural steel for ships similarly the material grade is also on the normal strength steel vl a on dnv gl classification rules see dnv gl 2015 the properties of the material of steel grade a is explained in table 1 2 2 the 3d laser scan process the dimension of the dog bone specimen is described in fig 2 further the acid cleaning process was conducted to remove the corrosion product of the corroded specimen as shown in fig 3 hence the astm g1 90 standard practice for preparing cleaning and evaluating corrosion test specimens was used as a reference on the process furthermore the 3d laser scanning technology was utilized to obtain an accurate surface morphology model of the corroded specimen as shown in fig 4 this is because a 3d laser scan has high resolution and provides preliminary data for advanced analysis 3d laser scanning technology avoids the shortcomings of conventional methods of measuring the depth of corrosion the laser scanner is a micro epsilon scan control llt2800 25 it was mounted on a screw slider driven by a small electric motor controlled by a systec xemo system model r362 g moreover the specimens were placed on one side so that the 3d scan process was conducted on the longitudinal direction the larger area close to the end side of the specimen was not scanned first the laser was started with movement along with the corroded specimen after one side of the specimen has been scanned it was rotated and reversed and the scan rerun a 90 overlap was considered between each scan to merge the generated point cloud the results of points cloud based on 3d scanning are presented in fig 5 2 3 statistical methods the characteristics of pit depth distribution on the corroded specimen are elaborated by using probability density function and cumulative distribution function based on matlab calculation additionally on the probability analysis three distributions are considered i e gaussian lognormal and weibull distribution furthermore the propensity of corrosion pit depth to a specific distribution is assessed by goodness fittest i e chi square and p value moreover the kurtosis and skewness on probability density function are used to assess corrosion pits irregularity and severity of pitting corrosion of corroded specimens thereby the equation for probability density function the cumulative distribution function of normal lognormal and weibull are defined as follows eq 1 f x 1 2 π σ exp 1 2 1 μ σ 2 f o r x r eq 2 f x 1 2 π σ x exp 1 2 t μ σ 2 d t f o r x r the standard normal distribution is in the case of μ 0 and σ 1 lognormal distribution considers a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed eq 3 f x 1 2 π x σ exp 1 2 l o f x μ σ 2 f o r x 0 eq 4 f x 1 2 π x σ 0 x 1 2 exp 1 2 log t μ σ 2 d t f o r x 0 the equation for probability density function and cumulative distribution function for weibull is written as follows respectively eq 5 f x λ σ x σ λ 1 exp x σ λ 0 x 0 λ eq 6 f x 0 x λ σ λ t λ 1 exp t σ λ d t 1 exp x σ λ where μ is the location parameter and σ is the scale parameter and λ is the shape parameter p p plot and q q plot are used to evaluate the distributions with more magnification in the center and tails of distributions respectively the visual results of the probability plot and the description of the quantiles plot are used to support the statistical results of goodness fittest and the calculated skewness respectively p p plot compares data from different distributions i e the empirical cdf and theoretical cdf of a data set visually meanwhile and q q plot compares the quantiles of data distribution with the quantiles of standardized theoretical distributions the appearance of empirical data and theoretical distribution is represented with the marker symbol and the reference line this line connects the first and third quartile and extends to the ends of the data the quantiles plot is constructed by inverse the cumulative distribution function the abscissa is the inverse of the cumulative distribution function and the ordinate is the x data value depends on the type of distribution the point of quantiles q on random variable x follows equations eq 7 p x q f x q p where fx is the cumulative distribution function of x the quantile function is obtained with the inverse of the cumulative distribution function eq 8 q f x 1 p 3 results 3 1 volumetric change ratio and corrosion pit depth distribution volumetric change ratio δvr is considered as a parameter describing the degree of corrosion the volumetric change ratio is acquired by calculating the initial volume of the specimen and final corroded volume condition the equation of volumetric change ratio is explained as follows eq 9 υ r v i v f v i a i l 1 n a f l a i l the initial specimen v i is acquired by multiplying the cross sectional area to the length of the specimen on the corroded one the specimen is divided into a number of cross sectional areas with a specific length between these areas the v f is obtained by the accumulation of multiplying length to numbers of cross sectional areas thereby the interval of the volumetric change ratio δvr for 14 corroded specimens is 14 84 28 29 as shown in fig 6 a a comparative analysis is conducted to see the correlation between corrosion pit depth along the axial direction and numerous volumetric change ratios δvr an irregularity is shown on the corrosion pit depth distribution along the length of 14 corroded specimens moreover each of the corroded specimens has no significant difference in a fluctuation of corrosion depth from the others which also represents the thickness thereby the irregularity along the length of the corroded specimen is relatively homogeneous with different thicknesses as a function of corrosion time exposure three volumetric change ratios are considered in the investigation of the characteristics of corrosion pit depth along with the corroded specimen i e 14 84 19 49 and 28 29 which represent the lowest medium and the largest volumetric change as shown in fig 6b this difference in volume explains the tendency of random surface irregularities at different volumetric changes accordingly surface irregularities among the δvr equal to 14 84 19 49 and 28 29 are different from each other these random patterns of irregularity valid for all 14 corroded specimens 3 2 corrosion pit depth distribution analysis on δvr 14 84 on the probability density function the average corrosion depth and maximum corrosion pit depth are represented by a peak in the middle and bottom of the tails as shown in fig 7 a the average corrosion depth and the maximum corrosion pit depth are respectively 1 633 mm and 2 344 mm further on the goodness fit test statistic a critical value equal to 26 125 and level of significance equivalent to 0 001 are respectively used as a limit on the calculation of chi square and p value the gaussian distribution has 6 659 of chi square value and a p value equal to 0 5738 the chi square and p value of the lognormal distribution are respectively 15 073 and 0 058 furthermore weibull distribution has a chi square value equal to 15 867 and 0 044 p value additionally the empirical data for the cumulative distribution function of corrosion pit depth has a similar pattern in terms of the slope and both tails on three distributions i e gaussian lognormal and weibull distribution as shown in fig 7b the short tails indicate small numbers of corrosion pit depth which close to minimum and maximum corrosion pit depth fig 7c shows that on the probability plot the empirical data appears along with the theoretical distribution which is represented with the reference line this line connects the first and third quartile and extends to the ends of the data additionally the empirical data is obtained from the observation during the experimental of 3d laser scans on corroded specimens i e corrosion pit depth meanwhile the theoretical distribution refers to the ideal of specific distribution e g gaussian lognormal and weibull distributions furthermore with regards to the cumulative distribution function on three distributions the theoretical and empirical corrosion pit depth distributions are fitted in the center additionally the use of the quantile plot is to describe the skewness i e the degree of asymmetry of the probability distribution from the mean value following the linearity between empirical data and the reference line on the quantile plot a tendency of left skewed or negative skewness is shown in fig 7d especially on the lognormal and weibull distribution this is in line with quantitative skewness value x i μ σ 0 963 3 3 corrosion pit depth distribution analysis on δvr 19 49 on the larger volumetric change ratio δvr i e 19 49 the probability density function pdf of corrosion pit depth is characterized by a peak in middle right and skewness to the left as shown in fig 8 a the average corrosion depth and maximum corrosion pit depth is 2 144 mm 2 832 mm respectively furthermore on the goodness fittest the pit depth distribution conforms more to weibull distribution this is indicated with the value of chi square equal to 13 921 which less than the critical value that is 26 125 the p value of 0 0839 is higher than the significance level 0 001 additionally the gaussian and lognormal distribution are off due to the chi square value is larger than the critical and the p value close to zero the cumulative distribution function with the volumetric change ratio δvr equal to 19 49 has a resemblance of distribution with a volumetric change ratio of 14 84 the difference is on the slope and tails small numbers of pit depths that close to its minimum value are indicated on a slightly longer tail on bottom left as shown in fig 8b meanwhile a large amount of corrosion pit depth is signified with a cut off line on the top right further on the probability plot with the volumetric change ratio δvr equal to 19 49 the empirical and theoretical distributions are more fitted to weibull distribution as shown in fig 8c additionally on the quantiles plot of weibull distribution the empirical plot data against the reference line shows a left skewed or negative skewness as shown in fig 8d it is indicated with most of the data on the right side with a long tail extending out to the left the skewness value 0 1829 is less negative than the skewness value at the volumetric change ratio δvr equal to 14 84 which is 0 963 3 4 corrosion pit depth distribution analysis on δvr 28 29 a peak in the middle and lower tails on both sides is found on the probability density function with the largest volumetric change ratio i e 28 29 see fig 9 a the average corrosion depth and maximum pit depth are equal to 3 111 mm and 3 721 mm respectively the distribution of corrosion pit depth is corresponded to gaussian distribution because of the chi square and p value results which respectively equal to 24 367 and 0 002 further the weibull and lognormal distributions are off due to a larger chi square value than the critical value and a p value close to zero on several volumetric change ratios the cumulative distribution function of all distributions has a cut offline i e short on both tails as shown in fig 9b the maximum and minimum pit depth is noted with these short tails which is also shown on the δvr 14 84 furthermore on the probability plot the empirical data for gaussian distribution are fitted to theoretical distribution on the reference line as shown in fig 9c the slope difference in both empirical and theoretical distribution on several volumetric change ratios describes the dispersion of data that is over dispersed data in fig 9d negative skewness or left skewed is described on the quantile plots on the volumetric change ratio δvr equal to 28 29 the calculated skewness has a larger negative value 0 488 compared to δvr 14 84 with 0 963 4 discussion on 14 corroded specimens the irregularity of corrosion pit depth distribution appears randomly with decreasing thickness and increasing volumetric change ratio δvr similar conditions occur for all 14 specimens it is due to the continuous corrosion time exposure during the ballasting and de ballasting process especially localized corrosion mechanisms in terms of pitting corrosion and microbial induced corrosion see heyer et al 2013 the probability density function is used to explain the likelihood of the pit depth distribution at a specific volumetric change ratio δvr additionally the corrosion stages on the corroded specimen can be explained with skewness and kurtosis on the probability density function see to et al 2018 goodness fit test statistics are carried out to investigate the propensity of pit depth to a particular distribution in the volumetric change ratio δvr 14 84 the pit depth distribution is more corresponds to the gaussian distribution this is related to the smallest chi square value and the largest p value respectively compared to the critical value and the value of a significant level as shown in table 2 on the volumetric change ratio δvr equal to 14 84 and 19 49 the pit distribution tendency is more conform to weibull and gaussian further seven specimens corresponded to gaussian six specimens belong to weibull and one specimen suit to lognormal distribution the correlation between corrosion pit depth distribution and these probability models is on the randomness of the corroded ballast tank s surface morphology i e gaussian and non gaussian the corrosion pit depth distribution is affected by the cumulative corrosion process i e microbiological induced corrosion and pitting corrosion accordingly it accumulates random discrete specific occasions and disregarding the governed local occasion distribution generates a cumulative effect governed by gaussian form see bhushan 2001 additionally single or extreme value processes are considered as non gaussian surfaces a resemble pattern on three distributions i e the gaussian weibull and lognormal is shown on the cumulative distribution function with three different volumetric change ratios δvr i e 14 84 19 49 and 28 29 furthermore the difference lies in the slope and the tails i e bottom left and top right the slopes tend to shallower with a greater volumetric change ratio this is related to the lower kurtosis which is a stable corrosion pit on the δvr 14 84 the tails on the top right and bottom left are relatively homogenous in length which is indicated with a small amount of minimum and maximum pit depth additionally few numbers of small pit depths are indicated with a slightly longer tail on the bottom left as shown on δvr 19 49 the use of probability plot and quantiles are to observe the lack of fit in the distribution at center and tail the graphical probability plot is used to assess whether the empirical data sets pursue to a particular distribution i e gaussian lognormal and weibull distribution the cumulative distribution function data is used to transform the data sets into a linear plot the comparison of observed empirical data to the theoretical data is at the center of probability plots therefore probability plots are suitable to compare the area with high probability density it is due to more rapid alteration of empirical and theoretical of cdf on this area compared to the area with low probability density on the probability plot of δvr 14 84 the gaussian distribution is more suitable compared to lognormal and weibull distribution this is indicated by more empirical data that is close to the reference line on the center of distribution the peak density of normal distribution is signified with a higher density in the middle right meanwhile weibull distribution and gaussian distribution is more corresponded to δvr equal to 19 49 and 28 29 respectively this correspondence is in line with the results of goodness fit test statistics considering different corrosion time exposure to et al 2018 have been able to link skewness negativity and severity of pitting corrosion whereas the surface morphology data obtained from 3d laser scans in this paper were taken at a certain time period therefore differences in volumetric changes due to uneven pitting corrosion are considered an independent parameter of skewness skewness and kurtosis are essential to describe the surface asymmetry and flatness see bhushan 2001 the skewness is calculated and its description can be seen on the quantiles plot of specific volumetric changes δvr at the δvr of 14 84 the irregularity due to the presence of pits is shown by negative skewness which is 0 963 further a decrease of pitting severity is indicated by the reduction of skewness negativity on the δvr equal to 19 49 with a value of 0 1829 moreover a less negative skewness value of 0 4879 is demonstrated on δvr equal to 28 29 the reduced negativity of skewness on a number of volumetric changes indicates that the severity of pitting corrosion is reduced as shown in fig 10 the linear regression of kurtosis shows a value higher than 3 indicating that pits cause a peak on corroded specimens additionally fig 10 shows a negative slope of kurtosis indicates the flat distribution with low kurtosis i e pit become stable thereby surface morphology is more homogeneous with increasing volumetric change ratio i e the severity of pitting corrosion decreases furthermore the lower pitting severity indicates a stable corrosion pit or uniform thus the greater the volumetric change the less sharp the corrosion pit fig 11 shows the correlation between the pitting factor pf at several volumetric changes in the longitudinal direction of the corroded specimen an indicator of the pitting severity of the corroded surface is the value of the pitting factor that is equal to 1 and larger than 1 see zhao and fu 2018 if pf is equal to 1 the specimen has a uniform corroded surface morphology in this case along with the longitudinal directions an increase of pitting severity is indicated by pitting factor value which larger than 1 the greater the pitting factor the more severe corrosion pits corrosion additionally the tendency of pitting factor fluctuations in longitudinal directions decreases with the increase of volumetric changes furthermore the linear regression line shows a negative slope of the pitting factor to volumetric changes δvr thus showing a tendency for surface morphology to be uniform considering the reduced severity of corrosion at larger volumetric changes and thus the corrosion pits tend to have a shallower pit or less sharp form further the findings of jakubowski 2014 stated that corrosion pit often has a conical shape and the uneven and localized characteristics of pitting corrosion thereby other possible shapes of corrosion pit of the corroded specimen with smaller volumetric changes are narrow deep and hemi spherical which also forms before ending in a shallow wide form as shown in fig 12 these corrosion pits form can be considered on corrosion pit modeling and growth the pit geometry considers faraday s law with the assumption of the constant volumetric growth rate of the pit until a critical depth the pit growth with at a constant volumetric rate dv dt follows the law of electrochemistry considering metal dissolution with the equation as follows see harlow and wei 1998 2009 and rajasankar and iyer 2006 eq 10 d v d t m i p n f p where m is the molecular weight of the material n is the valence f is faraday s constant equal to 96514 cmol 1 is the faraday constant ρ is density and i p is the pitting current considering temperature the mathematical equation of i p with an assumption of arrhenius law written as follows eq 11 i p i p o exp h r t where δh is the activation enthalpy r is 8 314 j mol k 1 for gas constant and t is temperature equation 11 is combined with equation 10 eq 12 d v d t m i p o n f ρ exp h r t the corrosion pit is considered to have a spherical form with volume eq 13 v 2 3 π 2 c a 2 where a and 2c are the major and minor axes respectively and to simplify the equation 2c is written as c the rate of volume alteration is written as follows eq 14 d v d t 2 3 π d c d t a 2 2 a c d a d t equations 12 and 14 are combined eq 15 2 3 π d c d t a 2 2 a c d a d t m i p o n f ρ exp h r t considering the aspect ratio rp equal to a c corrosion pit with a c equal 1 indicates that the pit has a hemispherical shape the shallow wide with has a c and a c signify the narrow deep the equation 15 is re written as eq 16 2 π r p 2 c 2 d c d t m i p o n f ρ exp h rt hence the volume is written as eq 17 v 2 3 π r p 2 c 3 the rate of volume of corrosion pit with the initial ci and final pit radius cf yields the equation as follows eq 18 2 3 π r p 2 c f 3 c i 3 m i p o n f ρ exp h rt t the eq 19 explains the total requires to pit the growth and size of the pit from the initial condition into the final condition in terms of critical pit size accordingly it is considered on the critical pit to crack transition see harlow and wei 1998 the adjustment of equation 18 is written as follows eq 19 t f 2 3 π r p 2 n f ρ m i p o exp h rt c f 3 c i 3 eq 20 c c i 3 3 2 m i p o n f ρ t π r ρ 2 exp h rt 5 conclusion this paper investigates the correlation between the difference in surface morphologies and corrosion pit geometry on the surface of the corroded ballast tank the corrosion pit depth distribution is analyzed with several statistical parameters such as probability distribution cumulative distribution function skewness and kurtosis probability plot and quantile plot additionally a number of volumetric change ratios are considered to differentiate a surface morphology from the others i e 14 84 19 49 and 28 29 furthermore irregularity of pit depth due to corrosion pits the tendency of corrosion pit depth to a specific distribution severity of pitting corrosion on the surface of the corroded specimen as well as corrosion pit geometry at a number of volumetric changes are elaborated on the present study the results are outlined as follows the irregularity of corrosion pit depth appears randomly with decreasing thickness of the corroded specimen and increasing volumetric change ratio δvr this is influenced by localized corrosion i e combination microbiological induced corrosion and pitting corrosion of seawater the peak the slope and both tails on respectively probability density function and cumulative distribution functions are effective in explaining the characteristics of corrosion pit depth distribution i e maximum and minimum pit depth and average pit depth the chi square test and p value on the goodness fittest of shows that seven specimens follow gaussian distribution five specimens suitable for weibull distribution and one fit to lognormal additionally the visual of a probability plot effectively supports the results of goodness fit tests to investigate trends to a particular distribution these distributions are related to the topography of randomness of surface roughness which consists of isotropic or anisotropic and gaussian or non gaussian the reduced negativity of skewness which is also described on quantile plots and a small negative slope on linear regression of kurtosis on a number of volumetric changes indicates the severity of pitting corrosion decreases this also signifies that the greater the volumetric change the less sharp the corrosion pit the pitting factor tends to decrease with the increase of volumetric changes indicate a tendency for surface morphology to be uniform and stable corrosion pit in other words the shallow wide form of corrosion pit is more likely on the larger volumetric change ratio nevertheless more specimens are needed for further research because this paper elaborated on 14

20864,temporal and spatial vortex shedding evolution for flow around a circular cylinder near a plane boundary is investigated using three dimensional direct numerical simulation with a parameter space of boundary layer thickness to diameter δ d 0 1 4 gap to diameter g d 0 4 and re 350 for each δ d three consecutive wake stages are divided with time based on the dominated flow structures mode a and mode b of which spanwise wavelength is quantitatively measured by the autocorrelation function acf in the first stage mode a structures spread from two spanwise ends to the middle region and from upstream to downstream wake simultaneously this stage is only dominated by ordered mode a structures and shows a weak three dimensionality in the second stage mode b structures start to propagate in the same spanwise but opposite streamwise direction as mode a and squeeze the mode a region until its disappearance a mixture of mode a and mode b structures dominate the second stage and the flow is in the strongest three dimensionality in the third stage the wake transits from a symmetric distribution of ordered mode b structure to an asymmetric distribution of disordered mode b structure showing a relatively strong three dimensionality the typical vortex shedding patterns are analyzed by dynamic mode decomposition dmd when δ d 0 the dominant mode frequency f 0 of vortex shedding larger than that of an isolated cylinder decreases with the increase of δ d due to suppression of the lower surface vortex shedding the flow structures with f 0 are greatly reduced both in size and regularity with the increase of δ d scattered mode components are reduced and the energy of each mode is more concentrated with increasing δ d keywords direct numerical simulation circular cylinder boundary layer thickness to diameter wake transition vortex shedding pattern 1 introduction flow around a circular cylinder near a plane boundary has received much attention due to its fundamental flow features and practical applications such as flow past a suspension bridge turbo machinery and pipelines near the seabed taneda 1965 alam and zhou 2007 sarkar and sarkar 2010 bai and alam 2018 when the cylinder is located close to a plane boundary the flow mechanism becomes complex compared with those in isolated condition williamson 1996a derakhshandeh and alam 2018 2019a 2019b and the vortex shedding behaviors and flow characteristics are influenced by several governing parameters such as the reynolds number re the gap ratio g d and the boundary layer thickness to diameter ratio δ d the effect of a plane boundary on the hydrodynamics forces and vortex shedding patterns has been experimentally and numerically investigated by many researchers bearman and zdravkovich 1978 grass et al 1984 sumer and fredsøe 1997 lei et al 1999 2000 sarkar 2008 sarkar and sarkar 2010 kazeminezhad et al 2010 wang and tan 2008a b sarkar 2008 studied the flow past a circular cylinder in proximity to a wall with g d 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 at re 1440 the results showed that when the lower shear layer immerses into the boundary layer a strong coupling between the lower shear layer and the approaching boundary layer is observed with suppression of vortex shedding and stretching of the shear layers however the shear layers and the boundary layer can be separately identified as the cylinder is kept outside the boundary layer sarkar and sarkar 2010 further found that the proximity of the wall causes asymmetry in the strength of vortex shedding lei et al 1999 investigated the flow around a cylinder in different layer thickness ratio δ d 0 14 2 89 at re 1 31 104 1 45 104 and showed that the vortex shedding is suppressed at g d of 0 2 0 3 depending on different δ d the further study of lei et al 2000 found that at lower re 80 1000 the critical g d for vortex shedding suppression was 0 2 at re 800 with δ d 0 5 but increased to 0 6 at re 200 δ d 0 9 and 1 0 at re 100 δ d 1 2 although the effects of the boundary layer thickness on the force coefficients have been investigated in the above experimental and numerical studies some inconsistencies are observed in the reported studies for example lei et al 1999 and zdravkovich 1985 found that there is a downward negative mean lift force acting on the pipe in the thick boundary layer while in the studies of jensen et al 1990 sarkar and sarkar 2010 and kazeminezhad et al 2010 the mean lift forces are always upward and positive besides buresti and lanciotti 1992 and kazeminezhad et al 2010 found that the mean drag force slightly decreases as the thickness of the boundary layer increases while the results of lei et al 1999 indicate that no monotonic relation was observed between the drag coefficient and the boundary layer thickness based on the vortex shedding patterns at different g d wang and tan 2008a b classified the g d into three regions 1 wall effect free region g d 1 0 where the vortex shedding resembles that of an isolated cylinder case 2 intermediate region 0 3 g d 1 0 where periodic shedding was significantly influenced by the plane boundary showing an asymmetric vortex shedding pattern and 3 suppression region g d 0 3 where the periodic shedding from the lower cylinder surface was suppressed several different studies have focused on the flow structure and wake transition for flow around a circular cylinder williamson 1996a b experimentally investigated the three dimensional 3 d flow structures that evolve from a two dimensional 2 d wake as the reynolds number is increased at approximately re 190 the previous 2 d wake vortex exhibits a strong waviness with a spanwise wavelength of approximately 3 4d this was referred to as mode a shedding at a higher reynolds number re 230 a shorter wavelength mode 1d termed mode b progressively dominated the wake however the wake transition and force evolution of a circular cylinder are significantly altered by the proximity of the wall for example nishino et al 2007 and nishino et al 2008 carried out a series of experiments on the flow around a circular cylinder placed near a moving ground with g d 0 1 1 0 at re 0 4 and 1 0 105 the moving ground is adopted to avoid the confusing effects of the boundary layer and thereby to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of ground effects they found that with the decreasing g d the kármán type vortex shedding becomes intermittent at g d 0 4 and totally ceases at g d 0 3 they also clarified that the reason for the cessation of the shedding is that the ground restricts the propagation of disturbances in the near wake region the studies of bimbato et al 2009 and marcos andré de oliveira et al 2020 showed that the moving ground effect contributed to appearing large and small peaks during the temporal evolution of the drag force curves and the critical drag behavior is primarily related to the change in wake structure by the ground effect rao et al 2013 2015 studied the wake transition for flow past a cylinder above a moving wall at g d to 0 005 for 25 re 200 they found that for g d 0 22 the onset of 3 d flow occurs from the steady 2 d flow regime for g d 0 22 3 d flow develops from unsteady 2 d flow at re 137 jiang et al 2017 numerically examined the 3 d wake transition for a circular cylinder placed near a moving wall at g d 0 4 with re 150 325 the flow structure in the wake undergoes a transition sequence of 1 2 d wake 2 ordered mode a shedding 3 mode swapping between mode a and mode b 4 mode b shedding they also found that at re 160 220 relatively strong three dimensionality is observed where the wake is dominated by ordered mode a and at re 225 275 the three dimensionality reduces as a mixture mode a and b shedding appears in the wake and also at re 285 the wake exhibits strong three dimensionality where increasingly disordered mode b dominates the wake although the effects of g d on the flow and force characteristics have been observed by the above authors the presence of the boundary layer makes the interactions between the ground and the cylinder wake more complex thapa et al 2014 ji et al 2020 thapa et al 2014 numerically investigated the flow past a circular cylinder near a fixed wall for g d 0 4 and 0 8 at re 500 and found that the flow three dimensionality weakens as the g d decreases from 0 8 to 0 4 the above studies have discussed the effects of g d δ d and re on the flow past a cylinder in the vicinity of a wall however the investigation of wake transition with time rather than re especially the spanwise distribution and evolution of the 3 d flow structures is scarce therefore the present research aims to investigate the temporal and spatial wake transition and spanwise vortex shedding behaviors with δ d ranging from 0 to 1 4 at g d 0 4 and re 350 through direct numerical simulation dns the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations the numerical methods and validation are presented the flow three dimensionality and wake transition are discussed in section 3 1 section 3 2 focuses on the vortex shedding patterns and fluid forces at different δ d finally major conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 numerical model 2 1 numerical methods the navier stokes and continuity equations governing the flow are solved by using the immersed boundary ib method the associated conservative forms of the second order adams bashforth temporally discretized governing equations of incompressible flow are 1 u n 1 u n δ t 3 2 h n 1 2 h n 1 3 2 p n 1 2 p n 1 f n 1 2 δ t

cartesian grids in eqs 4 and 5 g h represents a set of cartesian grids inside and outside ib n ibp is the total number of ib points δv i is the discrete volume of ib points x i and v m is the control volume of the cartesian grid x according to uhlmann 2005 the volume δv i should form a thin shell of the thickness equal to one mesh width around each ib point chen et al 2019a b the adopted discrete

point from a grid point in x y or z direction and h is the grid spacing the pressure poisson equation resulting from the decoupling of the flow governing eqs 1 3 is solved by using the biconjugate gradient stabilized method preconditioned by using the geometric multi grid method for the sake of conciseness further descriptions of the solution procedure can be found in our previous work ji et al 2012 2020 chen et al 2015 2019 zhang et al 2020 to verify the accuracy of the present numerical solution firstly flows around an isolated cylinder at re 350 were simulated and then compared the results with previous literature the computational domain of the validation case was 50d 50d 50d 50d 0d 12d in x y z directions respectively secondly flows around a cylinder close to a stationary wall are also performed with g d 0 8 and re 500 by adopting the same setups as thapa et al 2014 tables 1 and 2 present comparisons of drag c d and lift c l coefficients strouhal number st and base pressure coefficient c pb which are defined as 8 c d 2f d ρu2 dl c l 2f l ρu2 dl 9 st fd u 10 c pb 2 p b p ρu2 where f d and f l are the drag and lift forces respectively u is the free surface inflow velocity l the cylinder length f the dominant lift frequency p b the pressure at the rear stagnation point of the cylinder and p the reference pressure overall agreement with published experimental exp and numerical num data can be seen through tables 1 and 2 thus validating the present numerical methodology 2 2 computational domain and mesh convergence in the present study the re u d ν 350 is considered where d is the cylinder diameter u the free stream flow velocity ν the fluid kinematic viscosity the simulation domain and boundary conditions for the present simulations are shown in fig 1 the cylinder is horizontally placed near the bottom wall perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction in fig 1 g denotes the gap distance between the cylinder s lower surface and the bottom wall the g d is fixed at 0 4 because it is within the intermediate region where the wall effect is significant wang and tan 2008a b as shown in fig 1 the streamwise x cross flow y and spanwise z length of the domain are l u 44d 40d and 25d where l u 30d refers to the upstream distance from the inlet to the cylinder center for all δ d cases the upstream bottom wall consists of two parts where the first l 1 is considered as slip wall u y 0 v 0 w y 0 and no slip condition u v w 0 is adopted for the second part l tham et al 2015 it is noted that the free slip boundary is applied in the first part to avoid the adverse influences of the inflow boundary on the development of the boundary layer chen et al 2019 the approaching boundary layer thickness in the absence of the circular cylinder is calculated as δ 5 0 l re l tham et al 2015 where re l u l ν six cases of δ d 0 0 27 0 38 0 53 1 0 1 4 are considered in the present study based on the relative position to the cylinder corresponding to the non boundary layer case the cylinder being partially buried by the boundary layer and the fully buried case to be noted for the non boundary layer case δ d 0 free slip boundary conditions u y 0 v 0 w y 0 are applied on the whole bottom wall with the upstream distance l u is fixed at 30d for the boundary layer case δ d 0 27 non slip boundary u v w 0 starts at a specific streamwise position to generate the calculated boundary layer thickness therefore the upstream distances of the no slip boundary l for δ d 0 27 0 38 0 53 1 0 1 4 cases are 1d 2d 4d 14d and 28d respectively as shown in fig 1 for the inlet boundary the dirichlet boundary conditions u u v w 0 p x 0 with a uniform initial velocity profile u y u is specified the neumann boundary conditions u x v x w x 0 p 0 are adopted at the outlet free slip boundary conditions u y 0 v 0 w y 0 are applied to the top and two sides boundaries non slip boundary conditions u v w 0 are imposed on the cylinder surface in this study the boundary layer flow is laminar and the cylinder surface is hydraulically smooth as shown in fig 2 the computational domain is discretized by a cartesian mesh in the x y plane a uniform mesh with grid spacing δx δy d 32 is used near the cylinder to get adequate ib points on the cylinder surface and resolve the wake behind the cylinder away from this region the mesh is stretched out in the z direction a uniform mesh is adopted with a grid spacing of δz 0 065d based on the 3 d mesh dependence study jiang et al 2017 spanwise grid spacing δz of 0 1d would not affect the stability of 3 d flow proving the accuracy of the present spanwise grid to verify the mesh convergence simulations are conducted at three meshes in different densities as shown in table 3 for flow around a cylinder near a plane boundary with g d 0 4 δ d 0 53 and re 350 the hydrodynamic forces and st are presented it can be seen from table 3 that the maximum difference in root mean square rms drag coefficients c d rms between mesh b and c are about 0 74 within a reasonable error range the differences in c d and c l rms between mesh b and c are significantly reduced when compared with mesh a this indicates that results from mesh b are converged therefore based on the concern of numerical convergence and simulation efficiency mesh b is selected for numerical simulations in the present study the normalized time step size δtu d is set as 0 008 to satisfy the cfl criteria u δt δx 0 5 3 numerical results 3 1 flow three dimensionality and wake transition to investigate the wake transition regimes for flow past a near wall cylinder at re 350 beyond critical re 190 for the onset of 3 d instability williamson 1996b the temporal evolution of the hydrodynamic coefficients is first illustrated fig 3 shows the time histories of the span averaged lift and drag force coefficients with various δ d where the non dimensional flow time t is defined as tu d it can be seen from fig 3 that for each δ d the lift coefficients change in three stages with distinct amplitude in each stage whereas the fluctuating magnitude and duration of each stage varies with the δ d previous studies jiang et al 2017 zhao et al 2013 have shown that the variations of the hydrodynamic forces are related to the transition of flow structures therefore the flow structures at different time instants are presented in fig 4 for δ d 0 in fig 4 a and c the flow structures are captured by the iso surfaces of non dimensional streamwise vorticity ω x 0 5 which is defined as ω x u z y u y z u d in fig 4 b and d the vortex cores are captured by the second negative eigenvalue λ 2 0 5 of the tensor ψ 2 ω 2 where ψ and ω are the symmetric and asymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor respectively jeong and hussain 1995 the iso surfaces are colored by ω z u y x u x y u d to differentiate the clockwise and anti clockwise rotating spanwise vortical structures it can be seen from fig 4 b that at t 27 2 wavy fluctuations are observed around both ends of the spanwise vortex tubes whereas the tubes remain intact in the middle region and the adjacent spanwise tubes are parallel to each other williamson 1996b pointed out that the streamwise vortical structures initiate at the fluctuating positions between adjacent spanwise vortex tubes therefore in fig 4 a two pairs of streamwise vortical structures are distributed along the span in the range of z d 0 7 and 18 25 respectively however no streamwise vortical structures are observed in the middle region of the wake at this instant the distribution of streamwise vortical structures is symmetrical about the wake centerline as shown in fig 4 d when t 57 6 the spanwise vortex tubes exhibit significant fluctuations along the whole spanwise direction and approximately 25 pairs of streamwise vortical structures are distributed along the span fig 4 c the spanwise wavelength of the streamwise vortical structure is an important parameter to distinguish the flow structure mode a and mode b and the corresponding wake transition williamson 1996b therefore to accurately count the wavelength of the streamwise vortex pairs and thus determine the critical instants for different wake stages autocorrelation function acf is used to quantitatively calculate the wavelength by analyzing the vorticity value of the spanwise distributed streamwise vortex the autocorrelation function is defined as kozakiewicz et al 1992 11 r δ z e ω x z δ z μ ω x z μ σ 2 where ω x is the vorticity intensity of the streamwise vortex δz represents the sampling interval in spanwise direction μ and σ are the mathematical expectation and standard deviation of ω x respectively based on eq 11 the spanwise wavelength of a streamwise vortex pair can be quantitatively expressed by the distance between the first two adjacent positive extreme points as shown in fig 5 a fig 5 shows the autocorrelation coefficients r of the streamwise vortical structures along the span at different time instants with δ d 0 where the sample line for the streamwise vortical structures along the span is located at x d y d 1 0 5 in fig 5 three typical instants are selected to further accurately determine the critical instant for each wake stage it can be seen from fig 5 that the magnitudes of the autocorrelation coefficients are smaller in fig 5 b than in fig 5 a with more extreme points this indicates that with the development of flow the streamwise vortex is more irregularly distributed along the span and its wavelength decreases as shown in fig 5 a the wavelengths of the streamwise vortex pairs at t 26 4 27 2 are 2 82d 2 93d respectively which are close to the wavelength of mode a 3d for flow around an isolated cylinder williamson 1996b therefore the flow structures for these instants can be classified as mode a noted that when t 28 the autocorrelation coefficient shows a local fluctuation at roughly δz d 2 21 this implies that a small scale streamwise vortex structure mode b initiates in this region therefore t 27 2 is considered as the critical time instant when the flow structure begins to change from mode a to mode b that is when t 27 2 only large scale streamwise vortical structures of mode a can be observed in the wake as shown in fig 4 a when t 27 2 small scale streamwise vortical structures of mode b begin to initiate as shown in fig 5 b more extreme points are observed along the span compared with that at fig 5 a the autocorrelation coefficients also exhibit an increasing irregularity both in shapes and amplitudes at t 56 56 8 and 57 6 this indicates that at these instants the distribution of streamwise vortical structures is denser and more disordered along the span the spanwise wavelengths of the streamwise vortical structures at t 56 56 8 and 57 6 are 1 20d 1 13d and 1 07d respectively which are all close to the wavelength of mode b structure 1 0d the wavelength at t 57 6 with re 350 in the present study accords with the empirical formula of 20re 0 5 d for the wavelength of streamwise vortical structures within 300 re 1200 mansy et al 1994 therefore t 57 6 is set as the critical time instant when the span is filled by mode b structures as shown in fig 4 c it indicates that the mode a structure has disappeared since t 57 6 and then the wake is completely dominated by the mode b structure applying the above autocorrelation analysis of the streamwise vortical structures to different δ d cases the critical instants of the flow structure transition can be obtained and accordingly the wake can be divided into three stages at each δ d case as shown in fig 3 noted that the mode a structure initiates quickly after the vortex shedding and thus the two dimensional stage with pure spanwise vortex tubes only last for a short time therefore stage ⅰ refers to the wake that includes either the spanwise vortex tube or regular mode a structure stage ⅱ is the transition stage from mode a to mode b structure stage ⅲ represents the wake being dominated completely by mode b structure it can be seen from fig 3 a that when δ d 0 the lift coefficients in both stage i and stage ⅱ present regular sinusoidal variations however the amplitude of lift coefficient in stage ⅱ is smaller than that in stage ⅰ which is related to the energy transfer to the streamwise vortical structures zhao et al 2013 in stage ⅲ the flow transits into a stable and fully developed condition with the fluid force coefficients fluctuating in a small amplitude for other δ d the trends of lift and drag coefficients with time are consistent with that of δ d 0 whereas the drops of lift and drag coefficients from stage i to stage ii are more significant besides the initiation and duration of each wake stage are different from each δ d case for example when δ g 1 the duration of stage ii decreases with the increase of δ d indicating that mode a structure transits to mode b faster the variation of the flow three dimensionality with time is further examined with spanwise kinetic energy e z integrated over the near wake region where e z is defined as jiang et al 2017 12 e z 1 2 u z u 2 d v where v is the volume of the near wake field it ranges from the cylinder center to its 14d downstream in the x direction and 6d upside from the bottom wall in the y direction fig 6 shows the time histories of e z for different δ d it is seen from fig 6 that in the early stage of wake development e z of each δ d case approaches zero and thus the wake shows complete two dimensionality after that e z increases rapidly signifying an intensified three dimensionality of the flow where the wake transits from 2 d to 3 d during this time streamwise vortical structures of mode a first initiate and then transit to mode b structure when the flow transits into a fully developed stage especially when t 100 e z is stable and the fluctuation amplitude of e z is significantly reduced compared with that in the wake transition stage noted that under different δ d there are significant differences in e z trends during the transition from 2 d to 3 d wake for example when 0 δ g 1 δ d 0 27 0 38 e z shows a trend of first sharp increase and then drastic decrease however when δ g 0 and δ g 1 there is no significant drop in e z where e z gradually decreases from the peak in the transition stage to the stable situation for the fully developed 3 d wake besides with the increase of δ d the growth rate and peak value of e z first increase and then decrease with the maximum value appears at δ d 0 27 this is related to the strong coupling interaction between the boundary layer and the cylinder shear layers at δ d 0 27 and the specific reasons will be discussed later in section 3 2 it is seen from figs 3 and 6 that the lift drag coefficients and flow three dimensionality vary with time under different δ d to investigate the underlying correlation between these variations and the vortex morphology the instantaneous iso surfaces of flow structures in three different wake stages at δ d 0 are presented as shown in fig 7 in stage i when t 20 although approximately only 2 vortex pairs of mode a are observed near the two ends of the span as marked by the red dash box and no streamwise vortical structures initiate in the middle wake region the regularly distributed streamwise vortical structures in different rotation directions are symmetrical about the wake centerline as shown in fig 7 a in fig 7 b the clockwise blue and counterclockwise green spanwise vortex tubes shedding from the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder are alternately distributed in the wake no obvious fluctuations and distortions in spanwise and streamwise directions are observed on these tubes the spanwise vortex tubes in integrated shapes are parallel to the cylinder axis therefore at this instant the flow presents a two dimensionality where the e z is close to 0 as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 7 d in stage ⅱ when t 48 the spanwise vortex tubes are distorted and wavy fluctuations are observed in the spanwise direction these tubes in further downstream and near two ends show more significant fluctuations than those in the middle region for example in the range of x d 12 14 the spanwise vortex tube splits into many small segments at this instant in fig 7 c the streamwise vortical structures with smaller wavelength initiate at two ends and downstream of the wake region and a few streamwise vortical structures of mode b begin to fill in the vortex loop of mode a as marked by the gray dash box the streamwise vortical structures of mode a are gradually replaced by mode b especially in further downstream therefore mode b structure as marked by the yellow dash box or the mixed structure of mode a and b is dominant in this region however at this time in the region close to the cylinder as well as the middle region the wake is still dominated by the streamwise vortical structures of mode a the overall distribution of streamwise vortical structures in the wake is still symmetrical about the wake centerline during this time due to the transition of flow structure from mode a to mode b the interaction between these two types of vortical structures is significant leading to the sharp increase of the flow three dimensionality as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 7 f in stage ⅲ when t 80 the fluctuations of the spanwise tubes near the cylinder become increasingly significant for example the tube at x d 3 shows more waviness which will promote the initiation of more small scale streamwise vortical structures in fig 7 e the mode a structure exists only in the narrow stripe near the cylinder and the majority of the wake region is occupied by the mode b structure when the streamwise vortical structures gradually propagate from two ends to the central region the size of the void region without streamwise vortical structures gradually decreases and finally streamwise vortical structures distribute throughout the spanwise direction noted that when t 80 a gap at z d 12 5 is observed and the streamwise vortical structures are symmetrically distributed about this gap line however with further development of the flow when t 160 the gap has disappeared and the distribution of streamwise vortical structures is no longer symmetrical about the wake centerline as shown in fig 7 g at this instant as the mode b structure occupies the whole span the interaction between mode a and mode b structure is weakened leading to the reduction of the flow three dimensionality by comparing e z at t 80 and t 160 in fig 6 with time when the wake is completely dominated by irregular mode b structure only the interaction between disordered mode b structures exists therefore the flow three dimensionality exhibits fluctuation but the overall variation amplitude is small fig 8 shows the spanwise distribution of the streamwise u x and spanwise u z velocity at the corresponding time instant in fig 7 with δ d 0 where the sample line for velocity is located at x d y d 1 0 5 as shown in fig 8 a when t 20 in the region of z d 7 5 17 5 the u x remains constant at 1 25 and the u z is 0 however in the region of z d 7 5 and z d 17 5 the u z initiates and the u x fluctuates between 1 0 and 1 5 at this instant with the fluctuation of u x and the initiation of u z near the two ends the flow structures of mode a are observed at both ends whereas no streamwise vortex is observed in the region where u z is 0 as shown in fig 7 a when t 48 as shown in fig 8 b the magnitude of u x in the middle region is much lower than that of the two ends region that is the spanwise flow directing to the middle span increases the wake width in the middle thus leading to a large drop in the streamwise velocity besides the u x exhibits significant fluctuations in z d 7 5 17 5 leading to more waviness of the spanwise vortex tube in fig 7 d the stronger fluctuation of u x and u z near both end regions is related to the mixed distribution of mode a and mode b structures as shown in fig 8 c when t 80 u x and u z are uniformly distributed along the span with marginal fluctuations and are symmetric and antisymmetric about the mid span section z d 12 5 respectively at this instant ordered mode b structures are distributed throughout the spanwise direction fig 7 e with further development of flow when t 160 the u x and u z lost the symmetry along the span compared with those in t 20 48 and 80 more irregularity and fluctuation are also observed in u x and u z which is related to the enhancement of the intertwining between spanwise vortex tubes and streamwise vortical structures it is seen from figs 7 and 8 that mode a and mode b structures initiate and spread in the wake through different ways and it is related to the streamwise and spanwise velocity therefore the detailed movement pattern in streamwise and spanwise direction of mode a and mode b is investigated and summarized in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a after the symmetrical initiation from the two ends region of the wake mode a gradually spreads towards the downstream and the middle region of the wake the mode a structures at both ends move to the middle region at the same speed w a1 w a2 noted that the amount of the mode a pairs near two ends of the wake remains constant along the streamwise direction whereas the scale of vortex structures decreases gradually further downstream as shown in fig 7 a besides it can be seen from fig 8 that the streamwise velocity is larger than the spanwise velocity therefore the mode a structure moves faster in the streamwise direction than in the spanwise direction leaving a void middle region with no streamwise vortical structures when the mode a structure occupies the streamwise region in the wake of interest this spread mode of the streamwise vortex in mode a is found to dominate in stage ⅰ a small scale streamwise vortex of mode b is generated by further deformation of the large scale flow structures whereas its movement mode is different from the mode a structure as shown in fig 9 b mode b structures also initiate symmetrically near two ends of the wake and spread towards the middle region with the same velocity w b1 w b2 along the spanwise direction however under this condition the spanwise tubes and streamwise vortical structures show more significant fluctuations and distortions further downstream fig 7 g h leading to an increasingly large spanwise velocity therefore at a specified spanwise position the spreading speed w b1 w b2 of mode b presents a gradual increment from upstream to downstream this leads to a trend of mode b structure propagating from downstream to upstream this spreading mode is followed by the mode b structure in stage ⅲ during the flow development process although mode b appears later than mode a structure these two flow structures coexist during the wake transition stage stage ⅱ besides mode a and mode b structure spread simultaneously but in opposite streamwise directions as shown in fig 9 c these two flow structures finally meet in the middle region of the wake fig 7 c after that the larger scale mode a structure is squeezed by the smaller scale mode b structure and the region of mode a gradually decreases until it is completely occupied by the mode b structure fig 7 e fig 10 shows the temporal and spatial evolution of flow structures in the wake based on the spreading types of mode a and mode b structure in fig 9 as shown in fig 10 a 1 in stage i due to the perturbance by the waviness of adjacent spanwise vortex tubes in the wake mode a structures initiating near two ends spread to the middle region and propagate downstream simultaneously the whole streamwise region near two ends of the wake is then covered by the ordered mode a structure due to the dissipation of energy the scale of the mode a structure far away from the cylinder decreases slightly compared with that in the near wake leading to a propagating trend of expand towards both downstream ends in the streamwise direction fig 10a 2 it is noted that in stage i most of the middle region in the wake is still without initiation of streamwise vortical structures as marked by v in fig 10 in this stage the flow three dimensionality is very weak as the wake is dominated by pure and ordered mode a structure in stage ⅱ as shown in fig 10 b 1 when mode a structure spreads further downstream with the increasing disturbance of spanwise vortical structures and the dissipation of energy of mode a structure small scale streamwise vortical structures of mode b begin to initiate mode b structures first appear in the downstream and two ends of the wake region and gradually propagate towards the upstream and the middle region leading to a reduction of the mode a region as the spanwise spreading speed of mode b structure increases along the streamwise direction fig 9 the spanwise occupation speed by mode b is faster in the far downstream than that in the near wake leading to a spreading trend of shrink to the middle for the mode b region in the x direction fig 10b 2 when the mode a structure occupies the whole spanwise direction of the near wake region fig 10b 3 the mode b structures begin to squeeze the mode a structure and gradually occupy the middle region of mode a with time further downstream of the wake mode b structures cover the whole spanwise direction fig 10b 4 and they continue to replace the mode a structure by spreading towards the upstream wake until the disappearance of the mode a region at this stage the interaction between the disordered mode a and mode b structures is intensified especially with more irregular streamwise vortical structures in the wake which leads to the rapid enhancement of flow three dimensionality in stage ⅲ as shown in fig 10 c the wake is completely dominated by the mode b structure it is noted that at the early period of stage ⅲ the streamwise vortical structures present a symmetrical distribution about the wake centerline with ordered mode b structures along the spanwise direction fig 10c 1 with time as the ordered mode b structure becomes irregular and disordered the symmetry of the wake turns into an asymmetric one fig 10c 2 in this stage the flow three dimensionality drops from stage ⅱ due to the weakened interaction between mode a and mode b structures and it shows a stable trend with small fluctuations caused by the disordered mode b structures 3 2 vortex shedding pattern for different δ d the time and spanwise evolution patterns of the streamwise vortical structures described in section 3 1 are similar to each other but the propagation speed and duration of different flow structures vary with δ d it is noted that with the presence of the boundary layer the difference between fluid force coefficients and flow three dimensionality in the wake transition stage is more significant besides when the wake transits into a fully developed state the flow dynamics also vary with the δ d which is related to the different vortex shedding patterns fig 11 shows the instantaneous iso surfaces of λ 2 0 5 colored by ω z with different δ d at t 300 when the flow is fully developed it is seen from fig 11 that under different δ d although the spanwise vortex tube exhibits wavy deformation in the wake its axis remains approximately parallel to the cylinder spanwise direction as shown in fig 11 a at δ d 0 due to no suppression from the boundary layer the scale of the anti clockwise vortex tube shedding from the lower cylinder surface colored in green is comparable with that of the clockwise one colored in blue in the wake with the increase of δ d the suppression of vortex shedding from the lower surface gradually increases and thus the strength of the anti clockwise spanwise vortex tube is reduced for example when the cylinder is fully immersed into the boundary layer δ d 1 4 the vortex shedding from the lower cylinder surface is completely inhibited resulting in no anti clockwise spanwise vortex tube forming in the wake fig 11 f this suppression of the anti clockwise vortex shedding from the lower cylinder surface is related to the confinement by the clockwise vortical structures shedding from the boundary layer and upper cylinder surface li et al 2017 wang and tan 2008a b that is the roll up of the lower shear layer induces the lift off of the boundary layer forming a separated eddy of opposite sign this roll up of the boundary layer coalesces with the vortical structures from the cylinder upper side which in turn suppresses the vortex shedding of the cylinder lower side this vortex shedding suppression mechanism under the boundary layer condition is different from that of the non boundary layer condition where the cessation of the lower vortex shedding at a small gap ratio is due to the ground restriction on the propagation of wake disturbances nishino et al 2007 as shown in fig 11 b at δ d 0 27 disordered streamwise vortical structures of mode b are distributed along the whole spanwise region and the wake shows a strong three dimensionality however the amount of streamwise vortical structures gradually decreases with the increasing δ d which is related to the weakened deformation and split up of the spanwise vortex tubes especially when the δ d 1 4 for example in the near wake region x d 6 the spanwise vortex tubes remain intact along the span and almost no streamwise vortical structures are observed in this region as shown in fig 11 f the reduction of the streamwise vortical structures and the weakened interaction between streamwise and spanwise vortical structures also lead to the drop of the flow three dimensionality as shown in fig 6 fig 12 shows variations of the spatio temporal averaged drag and lift coefficients with δ d experimental and numerical data in the literature roshko et al 1975 nishino et al 2007 2008 kazeminezhad et al 2010 jiang et al 2017 marcos andré de oliveira et al 2020 for a single cylinder placed near a moving or fixed wall are also compared it is seen from fig 12 a that at δ d 0 the c d at the present study is close to those 3 d results of jiang et al 2017 at re 325 and nishino et al 2008 at re 1 0 105 whereas it overpredicts the experimental results of roshko et al 1975 and nishino et al 2007 besides due to the three dimensional 3 d effect the present c d is lower than those 2 d c d of jiang et al 2017 and nishino et al 2008 when δ d 0 27 owing to the vortex shedding suppression and the decrease of flow velocity around the cylinder the c d decreases with the increase of δ d this trend is also observed in the studies of kazeminezhad et al 2010 at re 9500 however the drop of c d with δ d in the present study is significant than that of kazeminezhad et al 2010 which is mainly related to the 3 d simulation of the present work compared with the 2 d study of kazeminezhad et al 2010 the difference in the reynolds number can be another possible reason as shown in fig 12 b for the no boundary layer condition δ d 0 the present c l is relatively larger than those experimental results of roshko et al 1975 and nishino et al 2007 while it agrees well with the 3 d c l of jiang et al 2017 with the presence of the boundary layer the c l first increases and then decreases with the increasing δ d besides in the thinner boundary layer cases δ d 0 53 the c l is upward and positive whereas a downward negative c l is observed in the thicker boundary layer cases δ d 1 which is also reported by lei et al 1999 zdravkovich 1985 and chen et al 2019a b however the results of kazeminezhad et al 2010 indicate that the c l slightly decreases with the increasing δ d besides in the results of kazeminezhad et al 2010 the c l is always upward and positive these inconsistencies may be related to the 2 d or 3 d characteristics of the simulation and the difference in δ d and reynolds number the non monotonic variation of c l versus δ d can be explained as follows due to the presence of the flat wall the vortex shedding in the gap is weakened which leads to a positive mean lift coefficient at δ d 0 when the boundary layer flow develops the upper and gap side flow velocity around the cylinder is asymmetrical about the cylinder horizontal centerline owing to the retarded flow in the boundary layer with the increase of δ d the flow shear rate near the cylinder becomes significant which leads to the increase of the mean lift force at δ d 0 53 however with an even thicker boundary layer δ d 0 53 in which the cylinder is partially or fully submerged the streamwise velocity around the cylinder decreases with the increasing δ d thus leading to the drop of the lift force note that the lift force coefficient c l is normalized by using the invariant free surface flow velocity u ꝏ on the other hand when the cylinder is gradually immersed into the boundary layer the vortex shedding is suppressed by showing only two stretched shear layers and thus flow around the cylinder is calmed therefore the combined effect of these two factors results in the decrease of the mean lift force with the increasing δ d when δ d 0 53 it is also noted that the mean lift force becomes negative at δ d 1 0 and 1 4 which is also observed in the studies of lei et al 1999 zdravkovich 1985 and chen et al 2019a b the attractive mean lift between the cylinder and the wall is mainly caused by the reversed velocity difference between the upper side flow and the gap flow i e the mean streamwise velocity in the gap is larger than that over the top surface of the cylinder chen et al 2019 as shown in fig 12 c at δ d 0 the c l rms is within the range of 3 d and 2 d results of jiang et al 2017 with the presence of the thinner boundary layer δ d 0 27 the c l rms drastically drops compared with that of δ d 0 besides the c l rms in the thicker boundary layer δ d 0 53 is comparable with those of kazeminezhad et al 2010 to further explore the underlying mechanism for the differences between fluid force coefficients and the scale and intensity of the vortical structures under different δ d the vortex shedding patterns in the wake are analyzed by dynamic mode decomposition dmd the technique of dmd is based on a koopman analysis of the dynamic system and developed by rowley et al 2009 and schmid 2010 this dmd method uses time sequence snapshots of the flow field to extract dynamic information that accurately describes the wake dynamics a detailed introduction of the theory and algorithm of dmd can be found in the work of rowley et al 2009 and schmid 2010 in the present study the dynamic wake information is extracted by a series of two dimensional snapshots of spanwise vorticity at z d 12 5 position fig 13 shows the dmd spectrum of the vortex shedding and the spanwise vorticity components of typical dynamic modes as shown in fig 13 a f when δ d 0 the dominant frequency f 0 of the vortex shedding strouhal frequency decreases with the increase of δ d this is related to the enhancement of vortex shedding suppression by the boundary layer however the f 0 under most δ d is still higher than 0 20 0 22 that of an isolated cylinder in the range of 300 re 1 4 105 blevins and saunders 1977 the variation of f 0 with δ d indicates that although the existence of the boundary layer will disturb the shear layers of the cylinder and thus accelerate the vortex shedding frequency a thicker boundary layer will delay the vortex shedding to a certain extent compared with that in a thinner boundary layer fig 13 g l shows that the mode with predominant frequency f 0 captures the coherent structure of kármán vortical structures the flow structures with mode f 0 are greatly reduced both in size and in regularity with the increase of δ d indicating a weakened intensity of the vortex shedding noted that when the lower cylinder surface is immersed in the boundary layer δ d 0 53 the vortex shedding with mode f 0 in the wake deviates towards the upper side away from the wall and the degree of deviation becomes more significant with the increase of δ d which is related to the increase of velocity gradient near the cylinder besides with the increasing δ d small scale banded vortical structures are observed close to the bottom wall representing the split up of vortex shedding due to the disturbance between the boundary layer and the cylinder shear layers as shown in fig 13 b f when δ d 0 many low frequency mode components are observed in the dmd spectrum the flow structure with dominant low frequency 0 1 f 0 0 2 f 0 0 25 f 0 shows a large scale banded shape in the near wall region which corresponds to the evolution of the secondary vortex in the boundary layer as also observed in he et al 2016 however when δ d 0 there is no such low frequency mode in the wake due to the lack of boundary layer besides when δ d 0 there are many scattered frequencies around the dominant mode frequency f 0 especially when δ d 0 27 under this case the shear layer from the lower surface of the cylinder is not wrapped by the boundary layer and the lower surface vortex shedding is not suppressed therefore the vortex shedding from the cylinder shear layers and the boundary layer presents a strong intensity and the mutual disturbance between the vortex shedding is considerably significant this can be proved by the irregular shapes and scales of the vortical structures in the wake corresponding to typical modes 0 1f 0 and 2f 0 as shown in fig 13 h this strong interaction between the shear layers and the boundary layer also results in the maximum flow three dimensionality at δ d 0 27 as shown in fig 6 with the increase of δ d the shear layer on the lower side of the cylinder is weakened and thus the vortex structure in the wake is more stable which was also found in the study of lei et al 2000 the weakened interaction between vortex shedding in the wake also leads to a reduction in flow three dimensionality as a result with the increasingly stable wake the scattered mode frequencies in the spectrum are reduced and the energy of each mode frequency is more concentrated which also leads to a more intact vortex structure in the wake for the respective mode frequency 4 conclusion this paper presents a three dimensional dns of flow around a circular cylinder near a plane boundary with a parameter space of δ d 0 1 4 g d 0 4 and re 350 the spatio temporal evolution of flow structures and the effects of the δ d on vortex shedding patterns and flow dynamics have been investigated and presented under different δ d three stages of the wake transition with time are observed based on the different flow structures mode a and mode b of which wavelength is quantitatively identified by the autocorrelation function acf in stage i mode a structures originating near two ends spread to the middle region and propagate downstream simultaneously in a trend of expand towards both downstream ends in the streamwise direction in stage ⅱ mode b structures first appear in the downstream and two ends of the wake region and propagate towards the middle and the upstream wake in a trend of shrink to the middle squeezing of the mode a region throughout spanwise and streamwise directions until the disappearance of mode a in stage ⅲ the wake transits from a symmetrical distribution of ordered mode b structure to an asymmetrical distribution of disordered mode b structure when δ g 1 the duration for mode a transiting into mode b decreases with the increase of δ d the flow three dimensionality along with the wake transition is also quantitatively measured through the spanwise kinetic energy e z for each δ d case the e z in stage i approaches zero indicating a weak flow three dimensionality however the growth rate and peak value of e z in stage ⅱ for 0 δ g 1 are significant than that for δ g 0 and δ g 1 e z shows a trend of first sharp increase and then a drastic decrease for 0 δ g 1 whereas e z shows a trend of first gradual increase and then a gentle decrease for δ g 0 and δ g 1 in stage ⅲ the e z for each δ d case remains in a relatively high and stable state with small fluctuations showing a relatively strong flow three dimensionality the vortex shedding patterns in the wake are analyzed by dynamic mode decomposition dmd when δ d 0 the dominant mode frequency f 0 of the vortex shedding decreases with the increase of δ d but it is still larger than that for an isolated cylinder due to the increasing suppression of anti clockwise vortex shedding from the cylinder lower surface the flow structures with mode f 0 are greatly reduced both in size and regularity with the increase of δ d the vortex shedding with mode f 0 in the wake deviates away from the wall and the degree of deviation becomes more significant with the increase of δ d many scattered mode components are observed in the dmd spectrum when δ d 0 whereas the scattered mode frequencies are gradually reduced and the energy of each mode frequency is more concentrated with the increase of δ d the present results suggest the applicability of the adopted numerical methodology to study flow characteristics around a near wall cylinder by comparing with the previous experimental and numerical studies however the underlying physical mechanisms for the non monotonic trend of the mean lift coefficients with δ d are to be further explored by studying in larger parameter space besides further analyses are necessary to fully understand the inconsistencies on the positive and negative mean lift coefficients among the previous literature as well as the present result the wake evolution mode at upper subcritical reynolds number with different boundary layers and gap ratios can also be investigated in the future based on the present study credit authorship

20864,temporal and spatial vortex shedding evolution for flow around a circular cylinder near a plane boundary is investigated using three dimensional direct numerical simulation with a parameter space of boundary layer thickness to diameter δ d 0 1 4 gap to diameter g d 0 4 and re 350 for each δ d three consecutive wake stages are divided with time based on the dominated flow structures mode a and mode b of which spanwise wavelength is quantitatively measured by the autocorrelation function acf in the first stage mode a structures spread from two spanwise ends to the middle region and from upstream to downstream wake simultaneously this stage is only dominated by ordered mode a structures and shows a weak three dimensionality in the second stage mode b structures start to propagate in the same spanwise but opposite streamwise direction as mode a and squeeze the mode a region until its disappearance a mixture of mode a and mode b structures dominate the second stage and the flow is in the strongest three dimensionality in the third stage the wake transits from a symmetric distribution of ordered mode b structure to an asymmetric distribution of disordered mode b structure showing a relatively strong three dimensionality the typical vortex shedding patterns are analyzed by dynamic mode decomposition dmd when δ d 0 the dominant mode frequency f 0 of vortex shedding larger than that of an isolated cylinder decreases with the increase of δ d due to suppression of the lower surface vortex shedding the flow structures with f 0 are greatly reduced both in size and regularity with the increase of δ d scattered mode components are reduced and the energy of each mode is more concentrated with increasing δ d keywords direct numerical simulation circular cylinder boundary layer thickness to diameter wake transition vortex shedding pattern 1 introduction flow around a circular cylinder near a plane boundary has received much attention due to its fundamental flow features and practical applications such as flow past a suspension bridge turbo machinery and pipelines near the seabed taneda 1965 alam and zhou 2007 sarkar and sarkar 2010 bai and alam 2018 when the cylinder is located close to a plane boundary the flow mechanism becomes complex compared with those in isolated condition williamson 1996a derakhshandeh and alam 2018 2019a 2019b and the vortex shedding behaviors and flow characteristics are influenced by several governing parameters such as the reynolds number re the gap ratio g d and the boundary layer thickness to diameter ratio δ d the effect of a plane boundary on the hydrodynamics forces and vortex shedding patterns has been experimentally and numerically investigated by many researchers bearman and zdravkovich 1978 grass et al 1984 sumer and fredsøe 1997 lei et al 1999 2000 sarkar 2008 sarkar and sarkar 2010 kazeminezhad et al 2010 wang and tan 2008a b sarkar 2008 studied the flow past a circular cylinder in proximity to a wall with g d 0 25 0 5 and 1 0 at re 1440 the results showed that when the lower shear layer immerses into the boundary layer a strong coupling between the lower shear layer and the approaching boundary layer is observed with suppression of vortex shedding and stretching of the shear layers however the shear layers and the boundary layer can be separately identified as the cylinder is kept outside the boundary layer sarkar and sarkar 2010 further found that the proximity of the wall causes asymmetry in the strength of vortex shedding lei et al 1999 investigated the flow around a cylinder in different layer thickness ratio δ d 0 14 2 89 at re 1 31 104 1 45 104 and showed that the vortex shedding is suppressed at g d of 0 2 0 3 depending on different δ d the further study of lei et al 2000 found that at lower re 80 1000 the critical g d for vortex shedding suppression was 0 2 at re 800 with δ d 0 5 but increased to 0 6 at re 200 δ d 0 9 and 1 0 at re 100 δ d 1 2 although the effects of the boundary layer thickness on the force coefficients have been investigated in the above experimental and numerical studies some inconsistencies are observed in the reported studies for example lei et al 1999 and zdravkovich 1985 found that there is a downward negative mean lift force acting on the pipe in the thick boundary layer while in the studies of jensen et al 1990 sarkar and sarkar 2010 and kazeminezhad et al 2010 the mean lift forces are always upward and positive besides buresti and lanciotti 1992 and kazeminezhad et al 2010 found that the mean drag force slightly decreases as the thickness of the boundary layer increases while the results of lei et al 1999 indicate that no monotonic relation was observed between the drag coefficient and the boundary layer thickness based on the vortex shedding patterns at different g d wang and tan 2008a b classified the g d into three regions 1 wall effect free region g d 1 0 where the vortex shedding resembles that of an isolated cylinder case 2 intermediate region 0 3 g d 1 0 where periodic shedding was significantly influenced by the plane boundary showing an asymmetric vortex shedding pattern and 3 suppression region g d 0 3 where the periodic shedding from the lower cylinder surface was suppressed several different studies have focused on the flow structure and wake transition for flow around a circular cylinder williamson 1996a b experimentally investigated the three dimensional 3 d flow structures that evolve from a two dimensional 2 d wake as the reynolds number is increased at approximately re 190 the previous 2 d wake vortex exhibits a strong waviness with a spanwise wavelength of approximately 3 4d this was referred to as mode a shedding at a higher reynolds number re 230 a shorter wavelength mode 1d termed mode b progressively dominated the wake however the wake transition and force evolution of a circular cylinder are significantly altered by the proximity of the wall for example nishino et al 2007 and nishino et al 2008 carried out a series of experiments on the flow around a circular cylinder placed near a moving ground with g d 0 1 1 0 at re 0 4 and 1 0 105 the moving ground is adopted to avoid the confusing effects of the boundary layer and thereby to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms of ground effects they found that with the decreasing g d the kármán type vortex shedding becomes intermittent at g d 0 4 and totally ceases at g d 0 3 they also clarified that the reason for the cessation of the shedding is that the ground restricts the propagation of disturbances in the near wake region the studies of bimbato et al 2009 and marcos andré de oliveira et al 2020 showed that the moving ground effect contributed to appearing large and small peaks during the temporal evolution of the drag force curves and the critical drag behavior is primarily related to the change in wake structure by the ground effect rao et al 2013 2015 studied the wake transition for flow past a cylinder above a moving wall at g d to 0 005 for 25 re 200 they found that for g d 0 22 the onset of 3 d flow occurs from the steady 2 d flow regime for g d 0 22 3 d flow develops from unsteady 2 d flow at re 137 jiang et al 2017 numerically examined the 3 d wake transition for a circular cylinder placed near a moving wall at g d 0 4 with re 150 325 the flow structure in the wake undergoes a transition sequence of 1 2 d wake 2 ordered mode a shedding 3 mode swapping between mode a and mode b 4 mode b shedding they also found that at re 160 220 relatively strong three dimensionality is observed where the wake is dominated by ordered mode a and at re 225 275 the three dimensionality reduces as a mixture mode a and b shedding appears in the wake and also at re 285 the wake exhibits strong three dimensionality where increasingly disordered mode b dominates the wake although the effects of g d on the flow and force characteristics have been observed by the above authors the presence of the boundary layer makes the interactions between the ground and the cylinder wake more complex thapa et al 2014 ji et al 2020 thapa et al 2014 numerically investigated the flow past a circular cylinder near a fixed wall for g d 0 4 and 0 8 at re 500 and found that the flow three dimensionality weakens as the g d decreases from 0 8 to 0 4 the above studies have discussed the effects of g d δ d and re on the flow past a cylinder in the vicinity of a wall however the investigation of wake transition with time rather than re especially the spanwise distribution and evolution of the 3 d flow structures is scarce therefore the present research aims to investigate the temporal and spatial wake transition and spanwise vortex shedding behaviors with δ d ranging from 0 to 1 4 at g d 0 4 and re 350 through direct numerical simulation dns the rest of this paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equations the numerical methods and validation are presented the flow three dimensionality and wake transition are discussed in section 3 1 section 3 2 focuses on the vortex shedding patterns and fluid forces at different δ d finally major conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 numerical model 2 1 numerical methods the navier stokes and continuity equations governing the flow are solved by using the immersed boundary ib method the

2012 2020 chen et al 2015 2019 zhang et al 2020 to verify the accuracy of the present numerical solution firstly flows around an isolated cylinder at re 350 were simulated and then compared the results with previous literature the computational domain of the validation case was 50d 50d 50d 50d 0d 12d in x y z directions respectively secondly flows around a cylinder close to a stationary wall are also performed with g d 0 8 and re 500 by adopting the same setups as thapa et al 2014 tables 1 and 2 present comparisons of drag c d and lift c l coefficients strouhal number st and base pressure

l the cylinder length f the dominant lift frequency p b the pressure at the rear stagnation point of the cylinder and p the reference pressure overall agreement with published experimental exp and numerical num data can be seen through tables 1 and 2 thus validating the present numerical methodology 2 2 computational domain and mesh convergence in the present study the re u d ν 350 is considered where d is the cylinder diameter u the free stream flow velocity ν the fluid kinematic viscosity the simulation domain and boundary conditions for the present simulations are shown in fig 1 the cylinder is horizontally placed near the bottom wall perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction in fig 1 g denotes the gap distance between the cylinder s lower surface and the bottom wall the g d is fixed at 0 4 because it is within the intermediate region where the wall effect is significant wang and tan 2008a b as shown in fig 1 the streamwise x cross flow y and spanwise z length of the domain are l u 44d 40d and 25d where l u 30d refers to the upstream distance from the inlet to the cylinder center for all δ d cases the upstream bottom wall consists of two parts where the first l 1 is considered as slip wall u y 0 v 0 w y 0 and no slip condition u v w 0 is adopted for the second part l tham et al 2015 it is noted that the free slip boundary is applied in the first part to avoid the adverse influences of the inflow boundary on the development of the boundary layer chen et al 2019 the approaching boundary layer thickness in the absence of the circular cylinder is calculated as δ 5 0 l re l tham et al 2015 where re l u l ν six cases of δ d 0 0 27 0 38 0 53 1 0 1 4 are considered in the present study based on the relative position to the cylinder corresponding to the non boundary layer case the cylinder being partially buried by the boundary layer and the fully buried case to be noted for the non boundary layer case δ d 0 free slip boundary conditions u y 0 v 0 w y 0 are applied on the whole bottom wall with the upstream distance l u is fixed at 30d for the boundary layer case δ d 0 27 non slip boundary u v w 0 starts at a specific streamwise position to generate the calculated boundary layer thickness therefore the upstream distances of the no slip boundary l for δ d 0 27 0 38 0 53 1 0 1 4 cases are 1d 2d 4d 14d and 28d respectively as shown in fig 1 for the inlet boundary the dirichlet boundary conditions u u v w 0 p x 0 with a uniform initial velocity profile u y u is specified the neumann boundary conditions u x v x w x 0 p 0 are adopted at the outlet free slip boundary conditions u y 0 v 0 w y 0 are applied to the top and two sides boundaries non slip boundary conditions u v w 0 are imposed on the cylinder surface in this study the boundary layer flow is laminar and the cylinder surface is hydraulically smooth as shown in fig 2 the computational domain is discretized by a cartesian mesh in the x y plane a uniform mesh with grid spacing δx δy d 32 is used near the cylinder to get adequate ib points on the cylinder surface and resolve the wake behind the cylinder away from this region the mesh is stretched out in the z direction a uniform mesh is adopted with a grid spacing of δz 0 065d based on the 3 d mesh dependence study jiang et al 2017 spanwise grid spacing δz of 0 1d would not affect the stability of 3 d flow proving the accuracy of the present spanwise grid to verify the mesh convergence simulations are conducted at three meshes in different densities as shown in table 3 for flow around a cylinder near a plane boundary with g d 0 4 δ d 0 53 and re 350 the hydrodynamic forces and st are presented it can be seen from table 3 that the maximum difference in root mean square rms drag coefficients c d rms between mesh b and c are about 0 74 within a reasonable error range the differences in c d and c l rms between mesh b and c are significantly reduced when compared with mesh a this indicates that results from mesh b are converged therefore based on the concern of numerical convergence and simulation efficiency mesh b is selected for numerical simulations in the present study the normalized time step size δtu d is set as 0 008 to satisfy the cfl criteria u δt δx 0 5 3 numerical results 3 1 flow three dimensionality and wake transition to investigate the wake transition regimes for flow past a near wall cylinder at re 350 beyond critical re 190 for the onset of 3 d instability williamson 1996b the temporal evolution of the hydrodynamic coefficients is first illustrated fig 3 shows the time histories of the span averaged lift and drag force coefficients with various δ d where the non dimensional flow time t is defined as tu d it can be seen from fig 3 that for each δ d the lift coefficients change in three stages with distinct amplitude in each stage whereas the fluctuating magnitude and duration of each stage varies with the δ d previous studies jiang et al 2017 zhao et al 2013 have shown that the variations of the hydrodynamic forces are related to the transition of flow structures therefore the flow structures at different time instants are presented in fig 4 for δ d 0 in fig 4 a and c the flow structures are captured by the iso surfaces of non dimensional streamwise vorticity ω x 0 5 which is defined as ω x u z y u y z u d in fig 4 b and d the vortex cores are captured by the second negative eigenvalue λ 2 0 5 of the tensor ψ 2 ω 2 where ψ and ω are the symmetric and asymmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor respectively jeong and hussain 1995 the iso surfaces are colored by ω z u y x u x y u d to differentiate the clockwise and anti clockwise rotating spanwise vortical structures it can be seen from fig 4 b that at t 27 2 wavy fluctuations are observed around both ends of the spanwise vortex tubes whereas the tubes remain intact in the middle region and the adjacent spanwise tubes are parallel to each other williamson 1996b pointed out that the streamwise vortical structures initiate at the fluctuating positions between adjacent spanwise vortex tubes therefore in fig 4 a two pairs of streamwise vortical structures are distributed along the span in the range of z d 0 7 and 18 25 respectively however no streamwise vortical structures are observed in the middle region of the wake at this instant the distribution of streamwise vortical structures is symmetrical about the wake centerline as shown in fig 4 d when t 57 6 the spanwise vortex tubes exhibit significant fluctuations along the whole spanwise direction and approximately 25 pairs of streamwise vortical structures are distributed along the span fig 4 c the spanwise wavelength of the streamwise vortical structure is an important parameter to distinguish the flow structure mode a and mode b and the corresponding wake transition williamson 1996b therefore to accurately count the wavelength of the streamwise vortex pairs and thus determine the critical instants for different wake stages autocorrelation function acf is used to quantitatively calculate the wavelength by analyzing the vorticity value of the spanwise distributed streamwise vortex the autocorrelation function is defined as kozakiewicz et al 1992 11 r δ z e ω x z δ z μ ω x z μ σ 2 where ω x is the vorticity intensity of the streamwise vortex δz represents the sampling interval in spanwise direction μ and σ are the mathematical expectation and standard deviation of ω x respectively based on eq 11 the spanwise wavelength of a streamwise vortex pair can be quantitatively expressed by the distance between the first two adjacent positive extreme points as shown in fig 5 a fig 5 shows the autocorrelation coefficients r of the streamwise vortical structures along the span at different time instants with δ d 0 where the sample line for the streamwise vortical structures along the span is located at x d y d 1 0 5 in fig 5 three typical instants are selected to further accurately determine the critical instant for each wake stage it can be seen from fig 5 that the magnitudes of the autocorrelation coefficients are smaller in fig 5 b than in fig 5 a with more extreme points this indicates that with the development of flow the streamwise vortex is more irregularly distributed along the span and its wavelength decreases as shown in fig 5 a the wavelengths of the streamwise vortex pairs at t 26 4 27 2 are 2 82d 2 93d respectively which are close to the wavelength of mode a 3d for flow around an isolated cylinder williamson 1996b therefore the flow structures for these instants can be classified as mode a noted that when t 28 the autocorrelation coefficient shows a local fluctuation at roughly δz d 2 21 this implies that a small scale streamwise vortex structure mode b initiates in this region therefore t 27 2 is considered as the critical time instant when the flow structure begins to change from mode a to mode b that is when t 27 2 only large scale streamwise vortical structures of mode a can be observed in the wake as shown in fig 4 a when t 27 2 small scale streamwise vortical structures of mode b begin to initiate as shown in fig 5 b more extreme points are observed along the span compared with that at fig 5 a the autocorrelation coefficients also exhibit an increasing irregularity both in shapes and amplitudes at t 56 56 8 and 57 6 this indicates that at these instants the distribution of streamwise vortical structures is denser and more disordered along the span the spanwise wavelengths of the streamwise vortical structures at t 56 56 8 and 57 6 are 1 20d 1 13d and 1 07d respectively which are all close to the wavelength of mode b structure 1 0d the wavelength at t 57 6 with re 350 in the present study accords with the empirical formula of 20re 0 5 d for the wavelength of streamwise vortical structures within 300 re 1200 mansy et al 1994 therefore t 57 6 is set as the critical time instant when the span is filled by mode b structures as shown in fig 4 c it indicates that the mode a structure has disappeared since t 57 6 and then the wake is completely dominated by the mode b structure applying the above autocorrelation analysis of the streamwise vortical structures to different δ d cases the critical instants of the flow structure transition can be obtained and accordingly the wake can be divided into three stages at each δ d case as shown in fig 3 noted that the mode a structure initiates quickly after the vortex shedding and thus the two dimensional stage with pure spanwise vortex tubes only last for a short time therefore stage ⅰ refers to the wake that includes either the spanwise vortex tube or regular mode a structure stage ⅱ is the transition stage from mode a to mode b structure stage ⅲ represents the wake being dominated completely by mode b structure it can be seen from fig 3 a that when δ d 0 the lift coefficients in both stage i and stage ⅱ present regular sinusoidal variations however the amplitude of lift coefficient in stage ⅱ is smaller than that in stage ⅰ which is related to the energy transfer to the streamwise vortical structures zhao et al 2013 in stage ⅲ the flow transits into a stable and fully developed condition with the fluid force coefficients fluctuating in a small amplitude for other δ d the trends of lift and drag coefficients with time are consistent with that of δ d 0 whereas the drops of lift and drag coefficients from stage i to stage ii are more significant besides the initiation and duration of each wake stage are different from each δ d case for example when δ g 1 the duration of stage ii decreases with the increase of δ d indicating that mode a structure transits to mode b faster the variation of the flow three dimensionality with time is further examined with spanwise kinetic energy e z integrated over the near wake region where e z is defined as jiang et al 2017 12 e z 1 2 u z u 2 d v where v is the volume of the near wake field it ranges from the cylinder center to its 14d downstream in the x direction and 6d upside from the bottom wall in the y direction fig 6 shows the time histories of e z for different δ d it is seen from fig 6 that in the early stage of wake development e z of each δ d case approaches zero and thus the wake shows complete two dimensionality after that e z increases rapidly signifying an intensified three dimensionality of the flow where the wake transits from 2 d to 3 d during this time streamwise vortical structures of mode a first initiate and then transit to mode b structure when the flow transits into a fully developed stage especially when t 100 e z is stable and the fluctuation amplitude of e z is significantly reduced compared with that in the wake transition stage noted that under different δ d there are significant differences in e z trends during the transition from 2 d to 3 d wake for example when 0 δ g 1 δ d 0 27 0 38 e z shows a trend of first sharp increase and then drastic decrease however when δ g 0 and δ g 1 there is no significant drop in e z where e z gradually decreases from the peak in the transition stage to the stable situation for the fully developed 3 d wake besides with the increase of δ d the growth rate and peak value of e z first increase and then decrease with the maximum value appears at δ d 0 27 this is related to the strong coupling interaction between the boundary layer and the cylinder shear layers at δ d 0 27 and the specific reasons will be discussed later in section 3 2 it is seen from figs 3 and 6 that the lift drag coefficients and flow three dimensionality vary with time under different δ d to investigate the underlying correlation between these variations and the vortex morphology the instantaneous iso surfaces of flow structures in three different wake stages at δ d 0 are presented as shown in fig 7 in stage i when t 20 although approximately only 2 vortex pairs of mode a are observed near the two ends of the span as marked by the red dash box and no streamwise vortical structures initiate in the middle wake region the regularly distributed streamwise vortical structures in different rotation directions are symmetrical about the wake centerline as shown in fig 7 a in fig 7 b the clockwise blue and counterclockwise green spanwise vortex tubes shedding from the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder are alternately distributed in the wake no obvious fluctuations and distortions in spanwise and streamwise directions are observed on these tubes the spanwise vortex tubes in integrated shapes are parallel to the cylinder axis therefore at this instant the flow presents a two dimensionality where the e z is close to 0 as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 7 d in stage ⅱ when t 48 the spanwise vortex tubes are distorted and wavy fluctuations are observed in the spanwise direction these tubes in further downstream and near two ends show more significant fluctuations than those in the middle region for example in the range of x d 12 14 the spanwise vortex tube splits into many small segments at this instant in fig 7 c the streamwise vortical structures with smaller wavelength initiate at two ends and downstream of the wake region and a few streamwise vortical structures of mode b begin to fill in the vortex loop of mode a as marked by the gray dash box the streamwise vortical structures of mode a are gradually replaced by mode b especially in further downstream therefore mode b structure as marked by the yellow dash box or the mixed structure of mode a and b is dominant in this region however at this time in the region close to the cylinder as well as the middle region the wake is still dominated by the streamwise vortical structures of mode a the overall distribution of streamwise vortical structures in the wake is still symmetrical about the wake centerline during this time due to the transition of flow structure from mode a to mode b the interaction between these two types of vortical structures is significant leading to the sharp increase of the flow three dimensionality as shown in fig 6 as shown in fig 7 f in stage ⅲ when t 80 the fluctuations of the spanwise tubes near the cylinder become increasingly significant for example the tube at x d 3 shows more waviness which will promote the initiation of more small scale streamwise vortical structures in fig 7 e the mode a structure exists only in the narrow stripe near the cylinder and the majority of the wake region is occupied by the mode b structure when the streamwise vortical structures gradually propagate from two ends to the central region the size of the void region without streamwise vortical structures gradually decreases and finally streamwise vortical structures distribute throughout the spanwise direction noted that when t 80 a gap at z d 12 5 is observed and the streamwise vortical structures are symmetrically distributed about this gap line however with further development of the flow when t 160 the gap has disappeared and the distribution of streamwise vortical structures is no longer symmetrical about the wake centerline as shown in fig 7 g at this instant as the mode b structure occupies the whole span the interaction between mode a and mode b structure is weakened leading to the reduction of the flow three dimensionality by comparing e z at t 80 and t 160 in fig 6 with time when the wake is completely dominated by irregular mode b structure only the interaction between disordered mode b structures exists therefore the flow three dimensionality exhibits fluctuation but the overall variation amplitude is small fig 8 shows the spanwise distribution of the streamwise u x and spanwise u z velocity at the corresponding time instant in fig 7 with δ d 0 where the sample line for velocity is located at x d y d 1 0 5 as shown in fig 8 a when t 20 in the region of z d 7 5 17 5 the u x remains constant at 1 25 and the u z is 0 however in the region of z d 7 5 and z d 17 5 the u z initiates and the u x fluctuates between 1 0 and 1 5 at this instant with the fluctuation of u x and the initiation of u z near the two ends the flow structures of mode a are observed at both ends whereas no streamwise vortex is observed in the region where u z is 0 as shown in fig 7 a when t 48 as shown in fig 8 b the magnitude of u x in the middle region is much lower than that of the two ends region that is the spanwise flow directing to the middle span increases the wake width in the middle thus leading to a large drop in the streamwise velocity besides the u x exhibits significant fluctuations in z d 7 5 17 5 leading to more waviness of the spanwise vortex tube in fig 7 d the stronger fluctuation of u x and u z near both end regions is related to the mixed distribution of mode a and mode b structures as shown in fig 8 c when t 80 u x and u z are uniformly distributed along the span with marginal fluctuations and are symmetric and antisymmetric about the mid span section z d 12 5 respectively at this instant ordered mode b structures are distributed throughout the spanwise direction fig 7 e with further development of flow when t 160 the u x and u z lost the symmetry along the span compared with those in t 20 48 and 80 more irregularity and fluctuation are also observed in u x and u z which is related to the enhancement of the intertwining between spanwise vortex tubes and streamwise vortical structures it is seen from figs 7 and 8 that mode a and mode b structures initiate and spread in the wake through different ways and it is related to the streamwise and spanwise velocity therefore the detailed movement pattern in streamwise and spanwise direction of mode a and mode b is investigated and summarized in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 a after the symmetrical initiation from the two ends region of the wake mode a gradually spreads towards the downstream and the middle region of the wake the mode a structures at both ends move to the middle region at the same speed w a1 w a2 noted that the amount of the mode a pairs near two ends of the wake remains constant along the streamwise direction whereas the scale of vortex structures decreases gradually further downstream as shown in fig 7 a besides it can be seen from fig 8 that the streamwise velocity is larger than the spanwise velocity therefore the mode a structure moves faster in the streamwise direction than in the spanwise direction leaving a void middle region with no streamwise vortical structures when the mode a structure occupies the streamwise region in the wake of interest this spread mode of the streamwise vortex in mode a is found to dominate in stage ⅰ a small scale streamwise vortex of mode b is generated by further deformation of the large scale flow structures whereas its movement mode is different from the mode a structure as shown in fig 9 b mode b structures also initiate symmetrically near two ends of the wake and spread towards the middle region with the same velocity w b1 w b2 along the spanwise direction however under this condition the spanwise tubes and streamwise vortical structures show more significant fluctuations and distortions further downstream fig 7 g h leading to an increasingly large spanwise velocity therefore at a specified spanwise position the spreading speed w b1 w b2 of mode b presents a gradual increment from upstream to downstream this leads to a trend of mode b structure propagating from downstream to upstream this spreading mode is followed by the mode b structure in stage ⅲ during the flow development process although mode b appears later than mode a structure these two flow structures coexist during the wake transition stage stage ⅱ besides mode a and mode b structure spread simultaneously but in opposite streamwise directions as shown in fig 9 c these two flow structures finally meet in the middle region of the wake fig 7 c after that the larger scale mode a structure is squeezed by the smaller scale mode b structure and the region of mode a gradually decreases until it is completely occupied by the mode b structure fig 7 e fig 10 shows the temporal and spatial evolution of flow structures in the wake based on the spreading types of mode a and mode b structure in fig 9 as shown in fig 10 a 1 in stage i due to the perturbance by the waviness of adjacent spanwise vortex tubes in the wake mode a structures initiating near two ends spread to the middle region and propagate downstream simultaneously the whole streamwise region near two ends of the wake is then covered by the ordered mode a structure due to the dissipation of energy the scale of the mode a structure far away from the cylinder decreases slightly compared with that in the near wake leading to a propagating trend of expand towards both downstream ends in the streamwise direction fig 10a 2 it is noted that in stage i most of the middle region in the wake is still without initiation of streamwise vortical structures as marked by v in fig 10 in this stage the flow three dimensionality is very weak as the wake is dominated by pure and ordered mode a structure in stage ⅱ as shown in fig 10 b 1 when mode a structure spreads further downstream with the increasing disturbance of spanwise vortical structures and the dissipation of energy of mode a structure small scale streamwise vortical structures of mode b begin to initiate mode b structures first appear in the downstream and two ends of the wake region and gradually propagate towards the upstream and the middle region leading to a reduction of the mode a region as the spanwise spreading speed of mode b structure increases along the streamwise direction fig 9 the spanwise occupation speed by mode b is faster in the far downstream than that in the near wake leading to a spreading trend of shrink to the middle for the mode b region in the x direction fig 10b 2 when the mode a structure occupies the whole spanwise direction of the near wake region fig 10b 3 the mode b structures begin to squeeze the mode a structure and gradually occupy the middle region of mode a with time further downstream of the wake mode b structures cover the whole spanwise direction fig 10b 4 and they continue to replace the mode a structure by spreading towards the upstream wake until the disappearance of the mode a region at this stage the interaction between the disordered mode a and mode b structures is intensified especially with more irregular streamwise vortical structures in the wake which leads to the rapid enhancement of flow three dimensionality in stage ⅲ as shown in fig 10 c the wake is completely dominated by the mode b structure it is noted that at the early period of stage ⅲ the streamwise vortical structures present a symmetrical distribution about the wake centerline with ordered mode b structures along the spanwise direction fig 10c 1 with time as the ordered mode b structure becomes irregular and disordered the symmetry of the wake turns into an asymmetric one fig 10c 2 in this stage the flow three dimensionality drops from stage ⅱ due to the weakened interaction between mode a and mode b structures and it shows a stable trend with small fluctuations caused by the disordered mode b structures 3 2 vortex shedding pattern for different δ d the time and spanwise evolution patterns of the streamwise vortical structures described in section 3 1 are similar to each other but the propagation speed and duration of different flow structures vary with δ d it is noted that with the presence of the boundary layer the difference between fluid force coefficients and flow three dimensionality in the wake transition stage is more significant besides when the wake transits into a fully developed state the flow dynamics also vary with the δ d which is related to the different vortex shedding patterns fig 11 shows the instantaneous iso surfaces of λ 2 0 5 colored by ω z with different δ d at t 300 when the flow is fully developed it is seen from fig 11 that under different δ d although the spanwise vortex tube exhibits wavy deformation in the wake its axis remains approximately parallel to the cylinder spanwise direction as shown in fig 11 a at δ d 0 due to no suppression from the boundary layer the scale of the anti clockwise vortex tube shedding from the lower cylinder surface colored in green is comparable with that of the clockwise one colored in blue in the wake with the increase of δ d the suppression of vortex shedding from the lower surface gradually increases and thus the strength of the anti clockwise spanwise vortex tube is reduced for example when the cylinder is fully immersed into the boundary layer δ d 1 4 the vortex shedding from the lower cylinder surface is completely inhibited resulting in no anti clockwise spanwise vortex tube forming in the wake fig 11 f this suppression of the anti clockwise vortex shedding from the lower cylinder surface is related to the confinement by the clockwise vortical structures shedding from the boundary layer and upper cylinder surface li et al 2017 wang and tan 2008a b that is the roll up of the lower shear layer induces the lift off of the boundary layer forming a separated eddy of opposite sign this roll up of the boundary layer coalesces with the vortical structures from the cylinder upper side which in turn suppresses the vortex shedding of the cylinder lower side this vortex shedding suppression mechanism under the boundary layer condition is different from that of the non boundary layer condition where the cessation of the lower vortex shedding at a small gap ratio is due to the ground restriction on the propagation of wake disturbances nishino et al 2007 as shown in fig 11 b at δ d 0 27 disordered streamwise vortical structures of mode b are distributed along the whole spanwise region and the wake shows a strong three dimensionality however the amount of streamwise vortical structures gradually decreases with the increasing δ d which is related to the weakened deformation and split up of the spanwise vortex tubes especially when the δ d 1 4 for example in the near wake region x d 6 the spanwise vortex tubes remain intact along the span and almost no streamwise vortical structures are observed in this region as shown in fig 11 f the reduction of the streamwise vortical structures and the weakened interaction between streamwise and spanwise vortical structures also lead to the drop of the flow three dimensionality as shown in fig 6 fig 12 shows variations of the spatio temporal averaged drag and lift coefficients with δ d experimental and numerical data in the literature roshko et al 1975 nishino et al 2007 2008 kazeminezhad et al 2010 jiang et al 2017 marcos andré de oliveira et al 2020 for a single cylinder placed near a moving or fixed wall are also compared it is seen from fig 12 a that at δ d 0 the c d at the present study is close to those 3 d results of jiang et al 2017 at re 325 and nishino et al 2008 at re 1 0 105 whereas it overpredicts the experimental results of roshko et al 1975 and nishino et al 2007 besides due to the three dimensional 3 d effect the present c d is lower than those 2 d c d of jiang et al 2017 and nishino et al 2008 when δ d 0 27 owing to the vortex shedding suppression and the decrease of flow velocity around the cylinder the c d decreases with the increase of δ d this trend is also observed in the studies of kazeminezhad et al 2010 at re 9500 however the drop of c d with δ d in the present study is significant than that of kazeminezhad et al 2010 which is mainly related to the 3 d simulation of the present work compared with the 2 d study of kazeminezhad et al 2010 the difference in the reynolds number can be another possible reason as shown in fig 12 b for the no boundary layer condition δ d 0 the present c l is relatively larger than those experimental results of roshko et al 1975 and nishino et al 2007 while it agrees well with the 3 d c l of jiang et al 2017 with the presence of the boundary layer the c l first increases and then decreases with the increasing δ d besides in the thinner boundary layer cases δ d 0 53 the c l is upward and positive whereas a downward negative c l is observed in the thicker boundary layer cases δ d 1 which is also reported by lei et al 1999 zdravkovich 1985 and chen et al 2019a b however the results of kazeminezhad et al 2010 indicate that the c l slightly decreases with the increasing δ d besides in the results of kazeminezhad et al 2010 the c l is always upward and positive these inconsistencies may be related to the 2 d or 3 d characteristics of the simulation and the difference in δ d and reynolds number the non monotonic variation of c l versus δ d can be explained as follows due to the presence of the flat wall the vortex shedding in the gap is weakened which leads to a positive mean lift coefficient at δ d 0 when the boundary layer flow develops the upper and gap side flow velocity around the cylinder is asymmetrical about the cylinder horizontal centerline owing to the retarded flow in the boundary layer with the increase of δ d the flow shear rate near the cylinder becomes significant which leads to the increase of the mean lift force at δ d 0 53 however with an even thicker boundary layer δ d 0 53 in which the cylinder is partially or fully submerged the streamwise velocity around the cylinder decreases with the increasing δ d thus leading to the drop of the lift force note that the lift force coefficient c l is normalized by using the invariant free surface flow velocity u ꝏ on the other hand when the cylinder is gradually immersed into the boundary layer the vortex shedding is suppressed by showing only two stretched shear layers and thus flow around the cylinder is calmed therefore the combined effect of these two factors results in the decrease of the mean lift force with the increasing δ d when δ d 0 53 it is also noted that the mean lift force becomes negative at δ d 1 0 and 1 4 which is also observed in the studies of lei et al 1999 zdravkovich 1985 and chen et al 2019a b the attractive mean lift between the cylinder and the wall is mainly caused by the reversed velocity difference between the upper side flow and the gap flow i e the mean streamwise velocity in the gap is larger than that over the top surface of the cylinder chen et al 2019 as shown in fig 12 c at δ d 0 the c l rms is within the range of 3 d and 2 d results of jiang et al 2017 with the presence of the thinner boundary layer δ d 0 27 the c l rms drastically drops compared with that of δ d 0 besides the c l rms in the thicker boundary layer δ d 0 53 is comparable with those of kazeminezhad et al 2010 to further explore the underlying mechanism for the differences between fluid force coefficients and the scale and intensity of the vortical structures under different δ d the vortex shedding patterns in the wake are analyzed by dynamic mode decomposition dmd the technique of dmd is based on a koopman analysis of the dynamic system and developed by rowley et al 2009 and schmid 2010 this dmd method uses time sequence snapshots of the flow field to extract dynamic information that accurately describes the wake dynamics a detailed introduction of the theory and algorithm of dmd can be found in the work of rowley et al 2009 and schmid 2010 in the present study the dynamic wake information is extracted by a series of two dimensional snapshots of spanwise vorticity at z d 12 5 position fig 13 shows the dmd spectrum of the vortex shedding and the spanwise vorticity components of typical dynamic modes as shown in fig 13 a f when δ d 0 the dominant frequency f 0 of the vortex shedding strouhal frequency decreases with the increase of δ d this is related to the enhancement of vortex shedding suppression by the boundary layer however the f 0 under most δ d is still higher than 0 20 0 22 that of an isolated cylinder in the range of 300 re 1 4 105 blevins and saunders 1977 the variation of f 0 with δ d indicates that although the existence of the boundary layer will disturb the shear layers of the cylinder and thus accelerate the vortex shedding frequency a thicker boundary layer will delay the vortex shedding to a certain extent compared with that in a thinner boundary layer fig 13 g l shows that the mode with predominant frequency f 0 captures the coherent structure of kármán vortical structures the flow structures with mode f 0 are greatly reduced both in size and in regularity with the increase of δ d indicating a weakened intensity of the vortex shedding noted that when the lower cylinder surface is immersed in the boundary layer δ d 0 53 the vortex shedding with mode f 0 in the wake deviates towards the upper side away from the wall and the degree of deviation becomes more significant with the increase of δ d which is related to the increase of velocity gradient near the cylinder besides with the increasing δ d small scale banded vortical structures are observed close to the bottom wall representing the split up of vortex shedding due to the disturbance between the boundary layer and the cylinder shear layers as shown in fig 13 b f when δ d 0 many low frequency mode components are observed in the dmd spectrum the flow structure with dominant low frequency 0 1 f 0 0 2 f 0 0 25 f 0 shows a large scale banded shape in the near wall region which corresponds to the evolution of the secondary vortex in the boundary layer as also observed in he et al 2016 however when δ d 0 there is no such low frequency mode in the wake due to the lack of boundary layer besides when δ d 0 there are many scattered frequencies around the dominant mode frequency f 0 especially when δ d 0 27 under this case the shear layer from the lower surface of the cylinder is not wrapped by the boundary layer and the lower surface vortex shedding is not suppressed therefore the vortex shedding from the cylinder shear layers and the boundary layer presents a strong intensity and the mutual disturbance between the vortex shedding is considerably significant this can be proved by the irregular shapes and scales of the vortical structures in the wake corresponding to typical modes 0 1f 0 and 2f 0 as shown in fig 13 h this strong interaction between the shear layers and the boundary layer also results in the maximum flow three dimensionality at δ d 0 27 as shown in fig 6 with the increase of δ d the shear layer on the lower side of the cylinder is weakened and thus the vortex structure in the wake is more stable which was also found in the study of lei et al 2000 the weakened interaction between vortex shedding in the wake also leads to a reduction in flow three dimensionality as a result with the increasingly stable wake the scattered mode frequencies in the spectrum are reduced and the energy of each mode frequency is more concentrated which also leads to a more intact vortex structure in the wake for the respective mode frequency 4 conclusion this paper presents a three dimensional dns of flow around a circular cylinder near a plane boundary with a parameter space of δ d 0 1 4 g d 0 4 and re 350 the spatio temporal evolution of flow structures and the effects of the δ d on vortex shedding patterns and flow dynamics have been investigated and presented under different δ d three stages of the wake transition with time are observed based on the different flow structures mode a and mode b of which wavelength is quantitatively identified by the autocorrelation function acf in stage i mode a structures originating near two ends spread to the middle region and propagate downstream simultaneously in a trend of expand towards both downstream ends in the streamwise direction in stage ⅱ mode b structures first appear in the downstream and two ends of the wake region and propagate towards the middle and the upstream wake in a trend of shrink to the middle squeezing of the mode a region throughout spanwise and streamwise directions until the disappearance of mode a in stage ⅲ the wake transits from a symmetrical distribution of ordered mode b structure to an asymmetrical distribution of disordered mode b structure when δ g 1 the duration for mode a transiting into mode b decreases with the increase of δ d the flow three dimensionality along with the wake transition is also quantitatively measured through the spanwise kinetic energy e z for each δ d case the e z in stage i approaches zero indicating a weak flow three dimensionality however the growth rate and peak value of e z in stage ⅱ for 0 δ g 1 are significant than that for δ g 0 and δ g 1 e z shows a trend of first sharp increase and then a drastic decrease for 0 δ g 1 whereas e z shows a trend of first gradual increase and then a gentle decrease for δ g 0 and δ g 1 in stage ⅲ the e z for each δ d case remains in a relatively high and stable state with small fluctuations showing a relatively strong flow three dimensionality the vortex shedding patterns in the wake are analyzed by dynamic mode decomposition dmd when δ d 0 the dominant mode frequency f 0 of the vortex shedding decreases with the increase of δ d but it is still larger than that for an isolated cylinder due to the increasing suppression of anti clockwise vortex shedding from the cylinder lower surface the flow structures with mode f 0 are greatly reduced both in size and regularity with the increase of δ d the vortex shedding with mode f 0 in the wake deviates away from the wall and the degree of deviation becomes more significant with the increase of δ d many scattered mode components are observed in the dmd spectrum when δ d 0 whereas the scattered mode frequencies are gradually reduced and the energy of each mode frequency is more concentrated with the increase of δ d the present results suggest the applicability of the adopted numerical methodology to study flow characteristics around a near wall cylinder by comparing with the previous experimental and numerical studies however the underlying physical mechanisms for the non monotonic trend of the mean lift coefficients with δ d are to be further explored by studying in larger parameter space besides further analyses are necessary to fully understand the inconsistencies on the positive and negative mean lift coefficients among the previous literature as well as the present result the wake evolution mode at upper subcritical reynolds number with different boundary layers and gap ratios can also be investigated in the future based on the present study credit authorship
